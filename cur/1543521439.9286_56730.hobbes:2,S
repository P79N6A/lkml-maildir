Someone misrepresented Linux to management, eh?
I'm not surprised you're getting flak.
If management know what they got into by approving Linux, you should be
paid for your work.  If they don't, someone misrepresented Linux and
that doesn't do you any good in the long run.
The kernel developers have always been clear that the core APIs change
from time to time, especially in the development branch.  They have
therefore represented Linux accurately.

You didn't know what you were really buying into when you started using
Linux?  I'm absolutely /sure/ the kernel developers have made it clear:
the APIs will change from time to time.  It has never been secret.  You
should not be surprised.

If you need a stable API, you chose the wrong operating system.  It's no
secret that Linux APIs change.  You can't blame the kernel developers
for doing exactly what they said they will do.  If you want, you can
blame the people who incorrectly assumed the APIs would stay the same,
for not investigating the obvious.
An all cases you should be paid for your work unless you were the one
who told management "let's use Linux, the APIs will not be a problem".
have a nice day,
