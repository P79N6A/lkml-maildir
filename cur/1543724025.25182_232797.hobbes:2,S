I keep getting the bug at random times. My googling resulted in a bunch of 
posts claiming that the problem is related to SMP systems and possibly to 
uptime. But not in my case- I do not have a SMP system and I sometimes get 
the bug right after bootup. SMP support is turned off, as you can see in 
my config:

I was getting it with 2.4.17, 2.4.24, and every single 2.6.x .
( I haven't tested other 2.4.x's )
