Yes. The change that fixed the mouse for others was to not probe for
irq12.
I suspect that we could even probe for irq12 as long as we after the probe
make sure that we don't leave it parked at the last irq we probed. It
_shouldn't_ matter, but it obviously does. 
You can test with one of the broken kernels whether the following
one-liner makes a difference for you: add the line
	exca_writeb(socket, I365_CSCINT, 0);
to the end of the yenta_probe_irq() function.
