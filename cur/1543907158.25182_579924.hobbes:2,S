The guarantee occurs in what context? Looks like its global here but 
allocations may be restricted to a cpuset context? What happens in a 
GFP_THISNODE allocation? Or a memory policy restricted allocations?

Only kmalloc? What about skb heads and such?

From a cpuset we may hit the reserves since cpuset memory is out and then 
the rest of the system fails allocations?
