Any reason to represent the triggers as numbers in sysfs? I'm a fan of how the 
IO scheduler is chosen on a block device. The file looks like:
noop [anticipatory] deadline cfq
You get a list of all available triggers, which one is active (and it's easy 
enough for user space code to parse). Obviously, to select a trigger, you 
just write its name to the file. Instead of 0, you say user, etc...
