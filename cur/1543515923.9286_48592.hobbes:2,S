People !!!
Is it supposed to be fixed ? Ever ?
Does anybody care at all ?
How can one try modular SCSI or modular IDE if it's impossible to get an
initial RAM disk ?
I can understand that there are some more urgent tasks, but this bug is
already through several "releases" :(( How can the shiny new 2.4 can be
released if half of 2.3 is not compilable at all ? Does anybody try to
compile the whole thing ?
Grrr....
