Here the same message (no medium found) pops up when there's no CD in
the drive; eject won't work and it prevents ascd from starting as well.
My card is an Advansys, I have a Pioneer 32x CDROM and a Mitsubichi
"Chemical" (Ricoh 6200 mechanism) CD writer. No other peripheral is
attached to the card, SCSI CDROM support is compiled as a module.
I suspect the bug/feature is in the SCSI CDROM handling code, as I can
reproduce it on both of these drives easily.
