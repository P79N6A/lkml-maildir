I like the modular design..

.. but I disagree with this. If there is functionality like generating
management frames, it is very much part of the ieee80211 subsystem in my
opinion.

I'm afraid of this leading to duplicated work since ieee80211 stack is
being used without this new SoftMAC code for devices that do need host
CPU to take care of functionality that is currently in SoftMAC module
and will be added to ieee80211 subsystem.
