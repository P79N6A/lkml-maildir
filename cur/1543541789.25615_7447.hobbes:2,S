It's important that non-aware tools continue to be non-aware, but do
the "right thing" as much as possible.
With a friend I just discussed that
	word myfile.doc
is supposed to work. Even if the stupid word-for-mac put a resource
file on the document. But we'd also like 
	cp myfile.doc mybackupfile.doc
to copy both the file and its resource fork. This is definitively not
possible. We're agreed that the first is a bit more important.

No. I'm not trying to say that. 
What I'm saying is that we've made dos' 11 character filenames
representable in Unix. In an intuitive way (in fact very similar to
what DOS does itself). "AUTOEXECBAT" becomes "autoexec.bat" (12
chars. Notice?). We've even turned the slash around, because that maps
easier on the way Unix guys would think of directories. There is
nothing wrong with C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI, we just say
/w95/windows/win.ini .
Fact is, that we've thought about it a bit, and now normal Unix
utilities like "tar" and "cp" work on an MSDOS filesystem. 
There is a translation involved from what's on the disk, and what we
present to the user. In the case at hand I want to make the suggestion
that keeping the "what we present to the user" reasonably unix-like. 
So:
drwxrwxr-x   2 wolff    users        1024 Aug 14 23:55 myfile/
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users           8 Aug 14 23:56 myfile/default
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users       16335 Aug 14 23:56 myfile/logo.gif
is a good way to show a file with named-stream-file to unix-users. Tar
understands what to do with this. If you shove this onto an ext2fs, 
you won't notice the difference. Good. 
If you add the convenience that 
	open ("myfile", O_RDONLY);
doesn't return EISDIR, but just opens myfile/default instead, then
"the you get the datafork if you forget about the named streams" also
works.
You can also do:
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users           8 Aug 14 23:56 myfile
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users       16335 Aug 14 23:56 myfile:logo.gif
Tar still works. You're in trouble a bit when the filesystem specifies
a file that contains a ":". These will be scarce in both Apple and NT
filesystems if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, if you DO encounter them, I'd
suggest that the file that apple would call 
	myfile:backup
	6d 79 66 69 6c 65 3a 62   61 63 6b 75 70
we'd see this file as:
	myfile%3abackup
	6d 79 66 69 6c   65 25 33 61 62 61 63 6b 75 70
and the apple file
	thesis 100% done
would become 
	thesis 100%2a done
	74 68 65 73 69 73 20 31   30 30 2a 32 61 20 64 6f 6e 65
Slightly ugly, but fortunately, cp, tar, the shell, every Unix utility
knows how to handle filenames that have odd characters in them.
I'm also cool with:
lrwxrwxrwx   1 wolff    users          13 Aug 15 00:07 my_file -> .my_file_data
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users           8 Aug 14 23:56 .my_file_data
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users       16335 Aug 14 23:56 .my_file_logo.gif
Now you may have to "mangle" filenames that start with a ".". If you
think that's more or less likely than "%" or ":" in a filename, that
can be a valid reason to chose one or the other method.
There are tons of ways of representing the different forks in a way
that normal unix-utilities don't notice anything "odd".
But 
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users           8 Aug 14 23:56 myfile
drwxrwxr-x   2 wolff    users        1024 Aug 14 23:55 myfile/
-rw-rw-r--   1 wolff    users       16335 Aug 14 23:56 myfile/logo.gif
is a good way to break way too many unix-semantics-expecting programs.
Linus, you can change the world. You have. But whenever possible, try
to map the "named streams" onto something that looks sensible to
classical Unix utilities. We can change "tar". You're losing the
"logo.gif" file if you untar this onto a non-named-streams supporting
filesystem.
Why is the Unix paradigm "everything is a stream of bytes" so good?
cp doesn't know wether it's copying ascii or binary data. cp doesn't
know wether it's copying from a file or a device. So with a few tools
that know how to handle "byte streams" you can make very powerful
scripts.
Similarly we've learned "tar" and "cp -r" how files and directories
work. I think we shouldn't yank the assumptions that they are making
from under them. Especially when there are workable alternatives.
So, I'm saying that "everything is a bytestream" should be expanded
to "everything is a normal directory hierarchy".
