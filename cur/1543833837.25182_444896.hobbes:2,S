Julien,
thanks for posting this.
I diff'ed the dmesg output and I think this is the chunk
might be more explicit symptom of your problem:
-Loaded prism54 driver, version 1.2
This output comes from drivers/net/wireless/prism54/islpci_hotplug.c:
	printk(KERN_INFO "Loaded %s driver, version %s\n",
You can verify if the driver isn't getting loaded until later (udev?)
or not all by doing "modprobe prism54" and see of that starts
working. If not, then my next guess would be something changed in the
prism54 driver so it doesn't claim your device.
The other thing I noticed is IRQ11 is assigned to a different PCI device:
2.6.16 :
-PCI: Enabling device 0000:03:00.0 (0000 -> 0002)
-ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:03:00.0[A] -> Link [PILC] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IR
Q 11
vs 2.6.17:
+ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [PILA] enabled at IRQ 11
+ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:01:00.0[A] -> Link [PILA] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IR
Q 11
This seems relevant since IRQ11 seems to be have been assigned by
the BIOS to _7_ devices according to the 2.6.16 lspci output.
This seems a bit unusual to me but maybe it's ok.
hth,
grant
