Hi List
I succeded twice in making a kernel_image with the Debian kernel-package and installaing the .deb file (2.4.18, 2.4.20).
My Installation where I boot from is bf24-2.4.20 (floppies).
I download the kernel sources to /usr/src/linux-2.4.21 I do make clean, make menuconfig and then make-kpkg -rev ywesee.1 kernel_image. 
The maschine ends the compilation just fine and I do dpkg -i kernel_image-2.4.21-ywesee.1-i386.deb.
Then I reboot, everythings starts fine _without a kernel panic.
But: After starting the cron daemon I get:
INIT:ld"2" respawning too fast:disabled for 5 minutes 
I get this several times...
Why do I get this message and how can I get rid of it so my 2.4.21 boots nicely.
(I need to start my installation again from the beginning as I can not boot into the old system).
Many thanks in advance for any help and hints.
Zeno
