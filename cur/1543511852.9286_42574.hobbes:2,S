I remember back when 2.0.20 was out there was a patch that allowed using /
on a server for the nfsroot of a number of clients.  using the convention
#host=<some host here># and so forth.
Is there anything like that for 2.2?  Be nice for nfsroot machine (say 10+)
that share the same directory on the server (but not the same / as the
server)
One more question (has nothing to do with this)
Why is it that if I have a machine with an nfsroot the /dev/tty* devices
never gets any of it's times updated?   (w always shows idle times as how
long it's been since the device was created)
