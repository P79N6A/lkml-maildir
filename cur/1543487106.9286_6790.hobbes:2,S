Subject: [CFT][ANN] New version of rename patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	Folks, rename patch rediffed against 2.2.2 is available at
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/rename-patch-8.gz
	Please, test it - so far it didn't chew anybody's filesystem, so
I'm going to submit it to Linus for 2.2.3 in a few days if no bugs will
be found.
	News: almost none. I've added a two-liner in coda_readdir() -
it is clearly needed and it didn't make its way into 2.2.2 [coda_readdir()
calls ->readdir() method on caching file but doesn't hold a semaphore on
its inode].
							Cheers,
								Al
