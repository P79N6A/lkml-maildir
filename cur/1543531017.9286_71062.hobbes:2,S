Disk space is cheap.
System is no more sluggish than currently, and is much more reliable.
First, "constant tweaking" means the system was/is undersized, and the
accounting records justify the additional business support for expansion.
Second, If it is determined that overcommitment is necessary, then it can
still be done - along with the documentation on what happens when the system
crashes.
I've never been fired for guaranteeing system uptime.
Obviously you don't work where uptime is counted in the thousands of dollars
per hour.

Yup - long download times since the system keeps crashing, forcing the
customer to a different site and or different company.
If network congestion is the problem here, it is also the problem without
overcommit. There is no correlation there.
The catastrophe is loss of business, loss of reputation, going out of
business because you can't keep the customers.
