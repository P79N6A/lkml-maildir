LinuxConf can be useful sometimes. If you want to show that Linux also can be
configured via point-and-click (of course you need to have good backup of all
configuration files or sometimes even whole system before stating the beast :-)
But installation of custom kernel with it... Gosh...

Perhaps. Unfortunatelly there was not enough magic in linuxconf :-( Just now
on my ssystem root lives on IDE disk and IDE is compiled as modules (if you
compiling CUSTOM kernel it's starnge thing to do but I'm using generic kernel)
so it's doable but LinuxConf was unable to cope with such kernel, that's all.

P.S. Do you have ideas why swapon/swapoff/dd failed ? It's not so big problem
to me (I can add format in Windows98 bootup script :-) but the whole thing
looks like swapoff does not do right thing and it can be dangerous.
