It shouldn't, but it can.  For example taking a spinlock just disables
preemption with a UP kernel, but with an SMP kernel I believe you can
actually end up spinning.  You would have to have hit a locking bug or
race condition for this to happen.  Just to be certain, can you
reproduce the problem with a UP kernel?
