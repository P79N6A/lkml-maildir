ActiveAnon is the active memory mapped into user processes,
plus swap cache.  ActiveCache is the active memory that's
only caching files and not mapped into user memory.
Note that this isn't always correct since a page can start
in one cache and become mapped by user processes, or be
unmapped.  Linux moves the pages lazily.

OK, vmtune -p is equivalent to cache-min, vmtune -P is
equivalent to cache-borrow ...
It looks like AIX doesn't have a cache-max, either.
kind regards,
