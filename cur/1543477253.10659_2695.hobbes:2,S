I believe the stock 2.0.31 kernel uses 0.87 tulip (please correct me if I'm
wrong). We have tried this with 2.0.36 and those systems do reboot.
However, your inquiry caused me to check the 2.0.31 kernel we're testing
and it turns out we were running .90f on these systems (my technician and I
had a misunderstanding when he setup the units).
.90f with 2.0.36 locks and reboots, with 2.0.31 it seems to be stable. I'm
testing .89K/PNIC/2.0.31 at 100mbit now with the netperf/hdparm -t test and
it has been running for about 4 hours without a failure. .89K/PNIC/2.0.36
running at 100mbit fails within 30 minutes reliably. Interestingly enough
.89K/PNIC/2.0.36 running at 10mbit has been running for 3+ hours now. I
will also setup a .90f/PNIC/2.0.36 test running at 100mbit.
In other news, ne2000/2.0.36 running netperf/hdparm -t test rebooted once
overnight. The Intel TX systems running .89K/PNIC/2.0.36 running the
netperf/hdparm -t test have not failed. Two systems running just the hdparm
-t test on 2.0.36 kernels (one ne2000, one .89K/PNIC) did not fail overnight.
The big common thread here that is emerging for me is that all combinations
of VPX motherboards, network cards and 2.0.35/36 lockup or reboot. I have
not been able to get any combination of motherboards, network cards and a
2.0.31 kernel to reboot, yet.
Anybody care to suggest patch areas between 2.0.31 and 2.0.36 to look for
this sort of problem?
Thanks,
Al Youngwerth
