Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/3] sched: hrtick and rt group scheduling

I spend xmas implementing group scheduling for the realtime scheduling classes.
Its a tad raw, but seems to work for the trivial test cases I threw at it.
The hrtick stuff is unrelated but was still stuck in my sched queue.
Patches against .26-rc6-mm1
