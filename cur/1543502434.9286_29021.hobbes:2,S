	This is a well known problem.  It's a configuration error in
compiling the kernel.  The kernel was compiled with the Win95 Bug Workaround
enabled.  To use smbfs with Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000, this
option MUST BE DISABLED.  Several distros, including RedHat, have been
notified of the error and are correcting it in a future release.  To fix
it, you must recompile your kernel with that option disabled.  There is
no other workaround.
	ITMT, Tridge (Andrew Tridgell of the Samba Team) has revampted smbfs
and smbmount to eliminate the compile time option entirely, replacing it
with run time detection of broken Windows 95 systems.  Expect that in a
future kernel release sometime soon.
	Mike
