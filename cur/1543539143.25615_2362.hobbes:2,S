I have modified my mail to news script. I cannot understand where the double
'@' was coming from - the mailing list S/W?? Please let me know if the To:
header is still wrong.

Version 2.0.7 - ie. the one that is included with the Samba 2.0.7 distribution.
It does appear to mount OK - ie. no error messages at mount and works OK until
the hang I described above

Yes, I did have a previous version (before I checked out & installed the
smbmount from the 2.0.7 dist - I had forgotten to include its option on
./configure) but I thought that I had the 2.0.7. smbmount installed *when I did
the mounts* which caused the oops but see also my Ps. below)

I tried ls -laR & find on the smbfs mounted volume and both Oops. The find
command did run to completion though, IIRC.

I'm happy to have another go this week at getting the Oops. The Win98 remote
machine has had Win98 reinstalled due to other problems on it ;-) So I can't
test against that any more. There are several other Win98 machines here so I'll
have a go with one of them...

CCed: Due to possible news/mailings list problems.
Thanks
Tom.
Ps.  I have just had a seconds look at my logs. The second instance of an Oops
(find on remote smb mount) was not preceeded by the "SMBFS: need mount version 6
" messages. If it is helpful I can post/mail it to you... Sorry for any
confusion!
