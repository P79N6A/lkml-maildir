This conversation appears to be about 10 years to late.  We have been
providing 32bit alignment on 64bit platforms in the ELF notes since
they were introduced.  x86 is the last architecture to go 64bit.
Even readelf.c assumes notes are always 32bit aligned in their data segment.
If we were doing it from scratch there are clearly some decent reasons for
providing 64bit alignment of the descr field.  Those reasons may be
offset by the needless incompatibility between 32bit and 64bit notes
but that doesn't matter at this point.
The reality on the ground is 32bit alignment.  Doing anything else would
be ABI breakage.  Breaking the ABI of our core files and thus gdb and the
rest of the tools just to conform to some draft spec is daft.
The advantage is not worth it.  None of this stuff is on a fast path
anyway.
At this point the right solution is to amend the lsb so it clearly
specifies what the existing practice is.  So people don't read the
inconsistent specification and get confused.
