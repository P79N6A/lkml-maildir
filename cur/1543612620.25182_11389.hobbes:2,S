> We are using a Tyan 2688 motherboard (WinBond w83782d). The problem that I
> am having is the lm_sensors package is hanging when I load the w83781d
> (modprobe w83781d) driver. 
> 
> We are using the lm_sensors 2.6.2 and i2c 2.6.2. I have also tried the CVS
> version and have done:
> 
> modprobe i2c-piix4
> modprobe w83781d init=0
> 
> I have also tried modprobe w83781d force_w83782d=0,0x29
> 
> The system still hangs.
> 
> I read on the linux-kernel mailing list a similar problem and it said
> there was a bug in the winbond driver but there was has been patch posted
> to bugtracker but the changes have not been integrated with CVS yet? Not
> sure if this related.
> 
> Hoping someone can help me!
