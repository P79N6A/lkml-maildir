Well I did this yesterday night an upgraded to knfsd-1.4.7-7 and
kernel 2.2.13 as Alan Cox suggested. But there again the very first 
backup run yielded:
Oct 29 01:59:37 iwr01 kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Oct 29 01:59:37 iwr01 kernel: 08:11: rw=0, want=2045247456, limit=8924076

(Btw, what do the negative values mean, or it is just an integer overflow?)

I don't think that my problem is in hardware. I suspected my hardware
for quite a while. Other boxes with nearly identical hardware run rock
solid for some months now.

Well. I through out knsfd and installed the nfs-server-2.2beta40-1
package and at *very* first glance things seem to be better now. At
least the first two backup runs were fine. I keep my fingers crossed,
though, since the above errors occurred only from time to time.

Well, I did that. That box is not my playground, but the central
server of our (small, but working) group that I cannot shutdown at
will. 
For this machine, stable operation is of much more importance
than the last 20% performance, so I won't tweek it if not really
necessary. 
I tried to reproduce the effects on a (client) machine without nfs
server and tar'ed both to /dev/null and to real tape, but a handfull
of runs could not reproduce it. Dammned thing.
Would it help to have two playground boxes set aside? Is there such a
thing like a nfs-client-simulator? I reaaly do not want to abuse my
nonvirtual users for that purpose.
regards,
