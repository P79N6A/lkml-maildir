I'm getting a notable increase in people sending me patches that do major
things and should be 2.5 stuff. Please if you want to rewrite the VM completely,
redesign the scsi layer and the like wait until 2.5. 
Right now I'm only collecting patches that are driver bugfix/updates, arch
specific updates/fixes or bugfixes (not feature adds) for the core kernel code.
Anything else goes in the bitbucket
