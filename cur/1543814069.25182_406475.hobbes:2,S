I should have been a bit more explict in my previous message.
Actually, if you trace down the logic, it's only printed if
sys_mount() __DIDN'T__ set MS_VERBOSE in 'flags'.  The code in
fs/super.c sets the "silent" flag if (flags & MS_VERBOSE) is non-zero.
The meaning is reversed, which is counterintuitive.  Hence, my patch.
