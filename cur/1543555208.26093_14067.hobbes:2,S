Hi
I just noticed this problem - 
I'm missing some large files created in the filesystem.
This is 'ls' output from 2.4.0-test11/test10
total 33
drwxr-xr-x    6 root     root         4096 Nov 20 18:06 .
drwxr-xr-x   42 root     root         1024 Nov 20 14:02 ..
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Nov 19 15:50 X
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root        16384 Sep 30 18:45 lost+found
ls: zero: Value too large for defined data type
And this is same directory with 2.2.17pre9
total 4561569
drwxr-xr-x    6 root     root         4096 lis 20 18:06 .
drwxr-xr-x   42 root     root         1024 lis 20 14:02 ..
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root        16384 zář 30 18:45 lost+found
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 lis 19 15:50 X
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     4294967295 lis 20 18:08 zero
Thought the 'zero' file has been created in 2.4.0-test11
I can't see it again with this kernel.
I would assume this is some problem of the kernel,
but maybe its incompatibility in libc - anyway I'm using
uptodate Debian Woody if this helps.
bye
