Disagree.  That would involve rewriting a lot of drivers.
flags: may or may not need sample-random flag.
name: is always the ethernet interface, for net drivers, or did you 
forget from your irqbalance days?  ;-)
data: in practice, is _rarely_ struct pci_dev.  It's usually a 
driver-private structure which is the structure most frequently 
accessed.  struct pci_dev* is rarely accessed inside the interrupt 
handler, except maybe somewhere deep in an error handling path.
