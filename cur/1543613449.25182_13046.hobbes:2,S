FWIW, I've been using this over-engineered, under-tested command line
utility to run e2fsck on our older distributions:
	
http://web.irridia.com/info/linux/unflimit.c
It works like "nice" or "time", but sets the proper RLIM_INFINITY
filesize limit for the inheriting subshell.  For example:
	unflimit e2fsck /dev/sda3
The boot-time fscks work fine, but in multiuser I'm extremely lucky to
get it to work without this.
The kernel patch below would work, I expect, but I think it's not
necessarily the Right Thing To Do.  If Andrew is right, is anyone
looking at why block devices (or fsck?) are honoring the filesize limit?
Thanks,

Ken.

| Perhaps the old app is calling sys_old_getrlimit() from
| linux/kernel/sys.c. It truncates rlimits to 0x7FFFFFFF
| if it's bigger than that. 0x7FFFFFFF used to be the old
| RLIM_INFINITY in 2.2 [actually, ((long)(~0UL>>1))]. In
| 2.4, RLIM_INFINITY is (~0UL).
| 
| So if you call sys_setrlimit() with the old RLIM_INFINITY from 2.2
| OR with the result from sys_old_getrlimit(), then the new limit
| will be 0x7FFFFFFF instead of unlimited.
| 
| Looks like someone forgot to implement sys_old_setrlimit(),
| which would have been the right thing to do.
| 
| Now all we can do is to hack sys_setrlimit and let it translate
| 0x7FFFFFFF to RLIM_INFINITY.
| 
| The following untested and uncompiled patch might do it, or not...
