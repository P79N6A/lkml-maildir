I shall try not to mix them in the future. The reason for the name in MIME is
probably because a (mime)charset does specify a character set (+encoding),
while the mime-encoding only specifies raw bytes.

I was thinking of the file system meta data so mount or the kernel or the fs could 
handle it.

I assumed a font problem because my machine is using ISO-8859-1 and 
XMMS doesn't display tose non-ascii characters I use; of course it could be both.
