I said B-Tree and not binary tree, please read the explaination about
B-tree at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree.
 Also I am aware of AVL
trees.
I never claimed that my implementation is better or anything like
that. I posted the code so that someone in need of the data structure
might use it. Also I would be willing them to help with their project.

Motivation will almost always beat mere talent.
