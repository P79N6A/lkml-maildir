It was my understanding that you could download SCO Linux up until about a 
month after they started the lawsuit. By that time, all/most of the contested
code had to already be in the kernel. Since SCO was supplying it, it was 
released (my opinion).
IMHO IBM AIX doesn't owe anything to SCO. Sure in the early days, IBM did 
consider using System V... but it had so many problems being ported that they
completely dropped it, and continued with AIX development instead.
I've used both.. and believe me, AIX doesn't work ANYTHING like System V. no
virtualization (disks), no partitioning (systems), no distributed operations, 
minimal networking, no Power support... (this was a 202e prototype at the 
time I believe...
All of that belonged to AIX. which even had SMP beginnings (some platforms).
Even shared memory was not exactly working well on System V (semaphores were
very slow).
