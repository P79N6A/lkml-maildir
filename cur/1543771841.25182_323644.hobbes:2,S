It was explicitly stated by Linus way back 2.6.8.1 time that
subsequent patches are against the base of the previous release, so
-rcs are against 2.6.x not 2.6.x.y.. which all makes great sense if
development is happening in parallel... I'm not sure I've ever heard
anything else stated to oppose this, but apparently some people have..
