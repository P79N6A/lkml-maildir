I've gotten no reliability reports whatsoever, but nobody's complained. 
I've run it for a couple of days and it worked fine for me, so that give 
me some level of confidence. As for your second question: I have no 
clue, this is out of my hands. I'm not even sure if I have to do 
anything specific (like officially submitting to Linus or something) in 
order to have it included. Can anyone tell me how this is usually done?
