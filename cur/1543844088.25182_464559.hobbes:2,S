Well, in this particular case the typing probably has to be weak, one
way or another. The meaning of the parameters is arguably opaque at
the interface - the attributes may be meaningful to specific components
of the system, but are not defined in the standardized interface (which
would otherwise have to know about all possible kinds of power
attributes and be changed every time a new one is added).
So, if you'd rather have an array of char* or void* values, that would
probably also meet the need, but my guess is that the typing is
intentionally opaque.

| Okay, state here means "operating point". How will operating points

| "high". How do you name them?
---
I don't think you would name the compounded states. Each CPU would need
to have its own defined set of operating points (since the capabilities
of the CPUs can reasonably be different).
