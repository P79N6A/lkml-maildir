I hate to be a stickler for the rules, but does this really meet this
criteria?
 - It must fix a real bug that bothers people (not a, "This could be a
   problem..." type thing.)
If the congestion control alogirthm is "Reno-like", what is
user-visible impact to users?  There are OS's out there with TCP/IP
stacks that are still using Reno, aren't there?  
Knowing the answer to the question, "How does this bug `bother' either
users or network administrators?" would probably be really helpful.
