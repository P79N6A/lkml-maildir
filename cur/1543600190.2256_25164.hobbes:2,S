Regardless of alignment, locked instructions in Intel machines are
atomic. Any "hidden" read/modify/write operations are performed
by the hardware, under the lock, preventing access by any other
CPUs or DMA.

Agreed that there are many "atomic_t" types on some drivers, and
"atomic" operations that don't need to be there. Unless a DMA operation
is in progress, anything executing under a spin-lock doesn't need
to be an "atomic" operation to make it, truly, atomic.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
