No, the option is set. But the changes are not visible in make menuconfig, that
is, i cannot select options that depend on NET_CLS_ROUTE.
I found out that if i select NET_CLS_ROUTE4, save my changes and exit
menuconfig, execute again make menuconfig and go to QoS options, then the new
available options are visible. So menuconfig has some problem refreshing
contents :?
thanks,
