I've been running 2.4.5 on my new Dell I8000 without too many
problems.  Last night I built -ac13 (on my porch) and booted it
without incident.  Later, going inside and re-connecting the AC I
notice that the thing's hung.  I play around a bit and discover that
the act of plugging or unplugging the power cord will hang the box.
This lead me to disable all power manglement in the BIOS.  No joy.
This problem does not exist using straight 2.4.5.
Has anybody else seen this?  Any debugging suggestions?  Or stated
differently, has anybody with this machine arrived at a configuration
that avoids weirdness in the power management framework?
