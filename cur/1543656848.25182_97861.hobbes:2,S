Try a minimal configuration, or the default one, (which is whatever
Linus uses).  Avoid modular IDE for now.

Sounds like an excellent job for a new kernel hacker to take on board
- why not make the standard templates yourself, and post them to the
list for each 2.5.x tree.  It *would* be quite useful, and save a lot
of developers' time, for example, it would stop a lot of people
complaining about modular IDE.

No.

* The mailing list archives
* Kernel Bugzilla
* (hopefully in a week or so) my new bug database which I am currently
  writing.
