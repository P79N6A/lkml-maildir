Yes I will. But only after you stop spreading BS about how fine and
generally dandy the situation about sound support in Linux is thanks  
to ALSA.
One reports bugs only if one expects that the situation will improve.
Glaring problems on average commodity hardware one expect the  
developers to take
care of without any notice.
However since the beginning the situation with ALSA has always been a  
lot of
advertisement how well it will work but the results where always less  
then stellar
if one looked at them from the functional side.
