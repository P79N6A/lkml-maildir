Hi,
I have had the same error (except that my console does not freeze, direct 
rendering is just disabled) since I updated my hotplug scripts to 20030501 
version. If I go back to 20030826 version, this error does not appear and 
direct rendering is working fine. I have tested with 2.5.69 and 2.5.69-bk12 
at least. Hardware is Radeon Mobility 9000 and I am using the radeon driver 
from XFree 4.3.0. BTW, my distribution is Gentoo, which adds some patches on 
top of hotplug. Here is the error from my dmesg output:
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
[drm] Initialized radeon 1.8.0 20020828 on minor 0
[drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held
[drm:radeon_unlock] *ERROR* Process 3677 using kernel context 0
And then from XFree log:
drmOpenDevice: minor is 0
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
