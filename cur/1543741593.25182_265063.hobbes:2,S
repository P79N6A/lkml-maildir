I agree. I didn't introduce that bug, the very same problem would happen
with the previous protection code. So this is not a regression, I'm far
from finished... I'm just trying to post orthogonal patches, since Hugh
had a much better merging success rate with small patches (though I find
very hard to produce small patches myself when there's more than one
thing to fix in the same file).
the per-classzone kswapd treshold was very well taken care of in 2.4,
thanks the watermarks embedding the low/min/high and the classzone being
passed up to the kswapd wakeup function.

that's the side effect of the per-zone lru too (though I'm not going to
change the lru).
