	So it sounds like any EISA or ISA card could be plugged into
these machines.
	This makes me lean infinitesmally more toward a parameter
to dma_alloc rather than a separate dma_alloc_not_necessarily_consistent
function, because if there ever are other dma_alloc variations that
we want to support, it is more likely that there may be overlap
between the users of those features and then the number of
different function calls would have to grow exponentially (or
we might then talk about changing the API again, which is not
the end of the world, but is certainly more difficult than not
having to do so).
