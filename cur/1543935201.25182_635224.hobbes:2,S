We're always open to new APIs (or more powerful and expanded old ones).
The way we've been doing the sg_chain conversion is to slide API layers
into the drivers so sg_chain becomes a simple API flip when we turn it
on.  Unfortunately sg_ring doesn't quite fit nicely into this.

Erm, but that's not really a fair comparison; you need the sg_table code
in
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-2.6-block.git 
branch sg as well.

OK, but realistically some of your criticisms are way outside of the
design intent.  Scatterlists (and now sg_chains) are the way the block
subsystem hands pages to its underlying block devices.  We do this
through two APIs:  blk_rq_map_sg() to take a request and place all the
pages into a scatterlist respecting the merging parameters and
dma_map_sg() which takes the scatterlist and produces an arch specific
DMA mapped scatterlist reusing the old list.  The requirement is that
dma_unmap_sg return the chain to its former state (so block device may
map, and unmap between congestion waits to avoid running systems out of
scarce IOMMU mappings), but there's not even a parallel
blk_rq_unmap_sg() beacuse the scatterlist is assumed disposable by the
block driver after the request completes.
By "someone elses" I'm assuming you mean a chain in a stacked block
driver?  You are actually allowed to transform these ... depending on
who does the dma mapping, of course, if the lower driver (yours) does
DMA mapping, you can do anything you want.  If the upper driver does,
then you have to preserve idempotence.
There have never until now been any requirements to join already
dma_map_sg() converted scatterlists ... that would wreak havoc with the
way we reuse the list plus damage the idempotence of map/unmap.  What is
the use case you have for this?

No it's not ... that's the whole point.  Code not yet converted to use
the API accessors is by definition unable to use chaining.  Code
converted to use the accessors by design doesn't care (and so is
"converted to chains").

Which, by definition, would have been pretty much all of them.
Another driving factor is that the mempool allocation of scatterlists is
suboptimal in terms of their bucket size, so we were looking to tune
that once the chaining code was in.  The guess is that we'd probalby end
up with a uniform size for scatterlist chunks, but if all drivers aren't
converted we can't do this type of tuning.

sg_table is sg_chain ... they're incremental extensions of the same body
of work.

What all this is saying to me is that we have an undesigned, ad hoc
interface for scatterlist manipulation in passthrough drivers.  Perhaps
we should start by defining that API and its associated requirements.
i.e. what is it that pass through drivers want to be able to do to
scatterlists?  The only such example of a driver like that I know is the
crypto API and now your virtio.  Once we have the actual requirements
and then the API, I think the natural data structures will probably drop
out.
