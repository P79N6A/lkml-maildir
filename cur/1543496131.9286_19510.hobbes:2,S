I'm having problems with what I believe is IP_MASQ and ssh/telnet...  If I
open a telnet or ssh session to my server behind my ip_masq box, it
disconnects me after and some idle time.  I haven't timed it so I'm not sure
if it is the same all the time.  If I do tail -f /some/file and leave it it
won't connect me as long as data comes through, or if I'm in ncftp
downloading something or wget.  I'm using 2.2.3 on my masq server.
