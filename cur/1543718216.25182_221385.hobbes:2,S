OK, well if you're correlating /proc/cpuinfo (online cpus) and
/proc/stat (possible cpus), then I can understand top getting upset.
Perhaps we should only show online cpus in /proc/stat, but the totals
displayed must still include all CPUs I think.
How's this version:
Name: Fix overzealous use of online cpu iterators
Status: Trivial
The IA64 hotplug CPU merge seems to have included some core changes: in
particular the recalc_bh_state() needs to sum for all (including
offline) cpus, since we don't empty the counters on CPU down.  The
totals printed by /proc/stat (the first loop) should include offline
cpus, too (apparently printing out the per-cpu lines for offline cpus
confuses top).
