If init dies, init is broken. It should catch the signal.
Signals are often used for odd purposes. For example, SIGHUP is often
used to make a daemon reread config files. Compatibility with the rest
of the world would be nice.

No, we need them for SIGSYS and SIGEMT. The Linux-specific signals only
exist on i386, arm, ppc, and m68k. Every other port (sparc*, alpha, mips)
defines SIGSYS and SIGEMT like a normal UNIX or BSD would. We can't have
a LinuxThreads that only works on 1/2 of the Linux ports. LinuxThreads
should be using a reserved portion of the RT signals.
For example, Digital Unix has SIGRTMIN==33 and SIGRTMAX==48.
As another example, UnixWare 7 defines these:
SIGWAITING 32  Ignore   All LWPs blocked 
SIGLWP     33  Ignore   Virtual Interprocessor Interrupt for thread library 
SIGAIO     34  Ignore   Asynchronous I/O
The same with AIX: they define almost a dozen high numbered signals.

I know it looks strange, but I tested it. Signals were set to
SIG_DFL before the test. By "daemon" I mean the process forked,
had the parent exit, and had the child call setsid().

I would not be surprised to see SIGEMT standardized. Every UNIX has it.
Every BSD has it. ("EMT" is a PDP-11 opcode, so this has a long history)
