After analysing below oops:

[    0.072989]  =======================
I've found that vfs_caches_init() got called after calling 
security_init() in the main kernel init path. 
This leads to kern_mount() Oopsing cause of Null dereferencing 
of mnt_cache  in the alloc_vfsmnt(mnt_cache, GFP_KERNEL) step.
I was thinking about exporting the current chosen_lsm[] string,
but I don't know if this maybe seen by Linus as another global
that arises from bad design. It may not also scale well if the
LSM needs to check if it's enabled in various places (lots of
strcmp()s).
