exit_mmap() has removed the vma from ->i_mmap and ->mmap prior to
unmapping the pages, so this should be safe unless that operation
can be caught while it's in progress.

In general the bitwise operations are more expensive than ordinary
spinlocks, and a separately-allocated spinlock (not necessarily
kmalloc()'d, sitting in struct page also counts, that is, separate from
the pte) introduces another cacheline to be touched where with in-place
locking of the pte only the pte's cacheline is needed.
