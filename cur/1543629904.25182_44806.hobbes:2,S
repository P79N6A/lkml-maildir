This is a change of behaviour in a fairly security sensitive area, so I'd
like us to step back and ask - should we fix the code or the comment?
An application using prctl()[1] is capability aware. I think it is fair
(and more secure) if we require these applications to explicitly request
raising capabilities in the effective set, after the switch from euid == 0
to euid != 0.
Comments?
Cheers
