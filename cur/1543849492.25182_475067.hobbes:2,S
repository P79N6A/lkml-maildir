90% of this changeset are MIPS-specific code.  Of that in turn much is
just infrastructure which is already being used anyway.

Both calls would have to be done  under the mmap_sem to close any races.

There isn't really.  Reordering with a patch like:

should close the hole for all effected architectures.  I say should
because this patch would need another round of linux-arch reviewing and I
haven't tested it this patch yet myself.
But even so that doesn't change that I would really like to make
copy_user_highpage() an arch interface replacing copy_to_user_page.
The current way of doing things enforces a cacheflush on MIPS which itself
is pricy - 1,000 cycles when it's cheap but could be several times as
expensive.  And as a side effect of the cacheflush the process breaking
a COW page will start with a cold page.
Or if an architecture wants to be clever about aliasing and uses the
vto argument of copy_user_page to create a non-conflicting mapping it
means the mapping setup by copy_user_highpage will be unused ...
