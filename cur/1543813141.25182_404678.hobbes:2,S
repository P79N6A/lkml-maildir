My "Compiler Writer's Guide for the Alpha 21264" says that if the
result of the first load contributes to the address calculation
of the second load, then the second load cannot issue until the data
from the first load is available.
Obviously, we don't care about earlier alphas as they are executing
strictly in program order.
