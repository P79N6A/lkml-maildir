Maybe we need a better description for the patch: the locking is already
there (the 'lock' field in struct sub_serial_port), and there is no
change of behaviour, just replacing a (spin_lock_t, int) by an atomic_t.
The purpose of the changes is removing the spinlock, because it is used
only to protect write_urb_busy, and if someday we need locking on other
parts, we already have a semaphore (introduced by Capitulino some time
ago, to fix a open()/close() race condition).
