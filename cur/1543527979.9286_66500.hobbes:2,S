No, you need to change a few bytes in the partition table.
(Roughly speaking: the partition is determined by the pair
(start,length). Earlier this was taken to be in 512-byte units,
now it is taken in hardware sector size units.
So, if your hardware sector size is 1024 bytes, these two
numbers must be halved. That is easy to do with some sfdisk
handwork. But I could write a tiny conversion utility
that does the `read, divide by 2, write' for you. Mail me
[not dwguest] if you need such a utility.)
