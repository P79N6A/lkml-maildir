Of course, if this is the case, the question will be raised. But as a
general rule, I don't see much potential in O(1) to finely tune scheduling
according to several criteria. In O(logN), you can adjust scheduling in
realtime at a very low cost. Better processing of varying priorities or
fork() comes to mind.
