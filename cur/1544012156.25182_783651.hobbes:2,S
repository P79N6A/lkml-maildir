I looked at the splice code again to make sure I don't miss anything. 
__splice_from_pipe() leads to pipe_to_sendpage(), which leads to 
sock_sendpage, then to sock->sendpage(). Sorry, but I don't see any 
point why to go over all the complicated splice infrastructure instead 
of directly call sock->sendpage(), as I do.

This is exactly what I implemented in the patch we are discussing.

Jens, I have never claimed I reinvented ->sendpage(). Quite opposite, I 
use it. I only extended it by a missing feature. Although, seems, since 
you were misleaded, I should apologize for not too good description of 
the patch.
Thanks,
