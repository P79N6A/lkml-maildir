Some comments about the packaging (which I made once before).
1) It claims to allow you to specify the kernel sources dir, but it then
runs 'depmod' without a nominated version which is only valid if you
are building for the running kernel. I now have it doing
        depmod -ae $(KERNELRELEASE)
2) 'make' will also install the module. It would be nice to have an
explicit 'make install' instead.
3) The module is installed as loop.o, same as the standard kernel
module. I prefer to use different names for added modules.
Also, it ends up in
        /lib/modules/VERSION/block/loop.o
which is fine for 2.2, but 2.4 uses
        /lib/modules/VERSION/kernel/drivers/block/loop.o
so you now have two loop.o - do you know which one will be loaded?
I changed it to install as loop-aes.o:
        cp -p loop.o $(ML)/kernel/drivers/block/loop-aes.o
and I can now select a module in the modules config.
