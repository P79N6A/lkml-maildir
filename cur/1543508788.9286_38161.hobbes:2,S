Experimental may just not work as advertised, or indeed at all, or perhaps
oops harmlessly. Dangerous eats things for breakfast, mainly filesystems,
I guess.
So, the PPP packet filtering stuff I'm currently putting off finishing
would be "experimental", whereas the NTFS write support is "dangerous"
because I /know/ it *can* eat filesystems, before breakfast, without spoiling
its appetite..
