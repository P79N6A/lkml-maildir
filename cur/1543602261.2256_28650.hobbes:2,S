   It happens because the format string to a printing function is
   set by the user.  You are correct that ifr_name[] is not a user pointer,
   but the contents of that array could contain dangerous placeholders set by
   the user.  I hope that clears things up.
I see... luckily these are (as far as I can tell) all root-only
operations.
Ok, it's pretty easy to add a quick verifier to dev_alloc_name, I'll
code that up.
Franks a lot,
