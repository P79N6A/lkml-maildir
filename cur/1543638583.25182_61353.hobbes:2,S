Nope, the idea is to push all caches according to size, but
often-used caches should shrink less than caches that are
hardly ever used.

Not quite, we still have some bad problems balancing the size
of these caches versus the size of the other VM occupants.
However, your shrinking function is good enough for now and
can be used with something like Ed Tomlinson's approach later
on to make reclaiming better balanced.
