PIO_FONTRESET ioctl which is old and the flag KD_FONT_OP_SET_DEFAULT.
I have to look at the setfont code to see if it sets this flag. I bet 
it doesn't. I don't see a flag to tell setfont to use this font as the 
default font for all terminals :-( The good news is you can tell which tty 
to change the fonts on (-c /dev/ttyX). So setfont has the idea of setting
a single tty but due to a bug in the console layer it set all terminals. 
I guess we need to update setfont for setting all terminals.

Ug!!!! I have cursor_shape in struct display for this reason. Will have to 
trace to find the problem.

   Your right. I realize my logic error. I was literally thinking too black 
and white. In the case of a cursor that is a white thin line at the bottom 
and a grey background. That is whole cursor image!! The mask should be
the font image to be drawn. 
   You can think of it as the cursor being a big grey cookie with white 
frosting decoration on the bottom. Then I come with my font shape cookie 
cutter and cut it out.
