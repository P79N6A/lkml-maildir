Not entirely thats why I havent sent that specific change on to Linus.
(He has the quiet early fix one which is vital to boot some old VIA boxes
 but not that one)
If you have a box with he thing triggering and a moment of time, tweak the
code to read "low1, high, low2, high2" and take min(low1,low2), with high1
as the test.
