I'm correcting my own post :-)
What we really want is:
prio: 0 .. [MAX_RT_PRIO - MAX_USER_RT_PRIO] .. MAX_RT_PRIO .. MAX_PRIO
                                                    |---- nice -------|
                         |------ user RT prio ------|
      |------------ kernel RT prio -----------------|
Remember, 0 is of highest priority.
