I don't think that's necessary if free_irq() or disable_irq() are called.
However, I'm not seeing those get called either.

In general, I don't think drivers need to call pci_intx().
I'm really not sure why it's exported even.

Combined with the fact that we can't find where MSI is disabled,
this bit of code in pci_enable_msi() might cause MSI reload to fail:
        /* Check whether driver already requested for MSI-X irqs */
        if (dev->msix_enabled) {
                dev_info(&dev->dev, "can't enable MSI "
                         "(MSI-X already enabled)\n");
                return -EINVAL;
        }

Neither. Code in sata_vsc.c is redundant and can be removed.
pci_intx() is necessary in some broken cases where INTX
has to be _enabled_ for MSI to work:

Jeff Garzik seems to like that construct:

http://lists.linuxcoding.com/kernel/2005-q3/msg11296.html
Shows when pci_intx() was added. linux-pci was NOT cc'd on that email.
And no one asked for Documentation/ update. C'est la vie.
BTW, gregkh is very good about posting patches when sending a pull request
to linus. But that just means it was likely buried in a pile of 50+ patches.
