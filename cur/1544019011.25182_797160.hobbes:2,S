I tried kernel 2.6.23.17 and there the touchscreen is recognized
using the builtin usbtouchscreen driver
/proc/bus/usb/devices delivers
T:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=1.5 MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 1.10 Cls=00(>ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS= 8 #Cfgs=  1

E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=   8 Ivl=5ms
and
/proc/bus/input/devices
I: Bus=0003 Vendor=0eef Product=0001 Version=0100

U: Uniq=
H: Handlers=mouse2 event3 
B: EV=b
B: KEY=400 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
B: ABS=3
I also tried to blacklist the usbhid with 2.6.28.2
then it display Driver=usbtouchscreen in /proc/bus/usb/devices
but still no entry in /proc/bus/input/devices
Any ideas?
