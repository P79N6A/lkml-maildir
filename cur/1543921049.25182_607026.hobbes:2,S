To be fair, we have violated the spec before in order to get crappy
hardware or to work around crappy ACPI implementations.
acpi_sleep=s3_bios for example violates the spec, but yet it is the
only way to get certain laptops to suspend/resume correctly.  
The question to ask is whether violating the spec will lead to (a) a
potential system hang/crash, (b) data corruption, (c) physical harm to
the device/laptop.
