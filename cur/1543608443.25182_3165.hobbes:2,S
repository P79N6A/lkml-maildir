I guess this might be related to the IDE updates, but my 12X IDE Cendyne
burner burns at what looks like 1X in 2.4.13-ac7!  It worked fine in
2.4.13-ac5 and below.  Checked software settings and everything but it
appears to be kernel related.  I don't know if it works in 2.4.13-ac6 (I
skipped that) and have made many a coaster before figuring out the
problem.  I use SCSI emulation built into the kernel to burn with my IDE
burner, BTW (no modules).
