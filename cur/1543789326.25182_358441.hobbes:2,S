But isnt this file counting a small problem ?
This small program can eat all available memory.
Fixing the 'file count' wont fix the real problem : Batch freeing is good but 
should be limited so that not more than *billions* of file struct are queued 
for deletion.
Dont take me wrong : I really *need* the file RCU stuff added in 2.6.14.
I believe we can find a solution, even if it might delay 2.6.14 because Linus 
would have to release a rc5
