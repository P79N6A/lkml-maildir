the debug code has to figure out when to trigger a deadlock warning 
message. If we are looping in a deadlock with irqs disabled on all CPUs, 
there's nothing that advances jiffies. The TSC is not reliable. The 
thing that remains is to use __delay(1). We could calibrate the loop 
separately perhaps?
