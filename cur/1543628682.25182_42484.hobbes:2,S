You don't _have_ to back out the ->special usage. As I mentioned, it was
always just a quick hack for ide-disk so I didn't have to change every
single driver out there.
There are two options, as I see it:
- Keep ata_request as an ide-disk speciality. This is pretty trivial
  even though other drivers use ->special, because the ata_ar_put()
  path simply needs to do
	struct ata_request *ar = rq->special;
	if (ar && drive->media == ide_disk)
		ata_ar_put(ar);
  and that is it.
- Make the ata_request the general means of passing down request in the
  IDE layer -- start by making hwgroup->rq into hwgroup->ar and _never_
  store ar in ->special (you don't have to, you will always just go from
  ar -> rq, which is of course ar->ar_rq). This is what I wanted to do.

If you didn't persist on pushing half-done stuff to Linus all the time,
I would have had the time to implement this properly... Now you keep
doing hackish work-arounds to make things limp along. So please calm
down for a moment, sick back, and think about it. It's a heck of a lot
better than going full throttle with an axe.
