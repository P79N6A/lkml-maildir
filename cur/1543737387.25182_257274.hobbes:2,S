The way cpusets uses the current cpus_allowed mechanism is, to me, the most
worrying thing about it. Frankly, the cpus_allowed thing is kind of tacked
onto the existing scheduler, and not at all integrated into it, and doesn't
work well if you use it heavily (eg bind all the processes to a few CPUs,
and watch the rest of the system kill itself). 
Matt had proposed having a separate sched_domain tree for each cpuset, which
made a lot of sense, but seemed harder to do in practice because "exclusive"
in cpusets doesn't really mean exclusive at all. Even if we don't have 
separate sched_domain trees, cpusets could be the top level in the master 
tree, I think.
