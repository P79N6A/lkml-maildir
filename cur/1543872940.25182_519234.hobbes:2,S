Thanks again for the feedback.  Given some discussions I had last week
in the office and the general feedback here, I'm going to remove the new
per-queue locking and leave the start/stop functions for each queue and
combine entry points for hard_start_xmit().  I'll get this out asap for
review once it's been tested here.  If we see issues in the future with
lock contention on the queues, we can revisit the per-queue locking.
Cheers,
