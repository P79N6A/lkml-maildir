Would you like me to include the portion that adds "*match" to "struct
device_driver"?  After some more thought, I began considering having
driver priority be a static quality of a device driver.  The question is
whether we want a device driver to be able to return a variable priority
based on bind device.  Also, "*match" could be used to split some
detection and validation out of "*probe".  What are your reactions to
this?
Finally, should every in-kernel driver be registered before devices are
detected?
Thanks,
Adam
