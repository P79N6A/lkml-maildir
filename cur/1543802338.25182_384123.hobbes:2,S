This usually happens when you use a different driver version that has
different mixer controls so that the saved state in /etc/asound.state
doesn't match.
I don't know why the "PNP OS" setting should affect which mixer
controls are available.  What are the differences in /etc/asound.state
after "alsactl store" in both cases?
