Hi Andrea,
I am yet to look at the new -aa you released. A small change is
required below. Currently, I cannot generate a patch. Sorry. Please
fix it by hand. Thanks.

This should be:
	vma = __vma_prio_tree_first(root, &iter, h_pgoff, ULONG_MAX);
> +	while (vma) {
>  		unsigned long h_vm_pgoff;
[snip]
> +		vma = __vma_prio_tree_next(vma, root, &iter, h_pgoff, h_pgoff);
>  	}
and here it should be:
		vma = __vma_prio_tree_next(vma, root, &iter,
						h_pgoff, ULONG_MAX);
Thanks,
Rajesh
