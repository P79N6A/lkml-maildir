I'd claim that the (tsk->pspace == pspace) test is pretty obvious.
However, the child_reaper one takes a little deduction.  Sometimes, I
think separating out even trivial functions into even trivialler :)
functions really does make sense for these.  They can be really
confusing.  BTW, I _still_ don't understand exactly what this is doing,
but I haven't had any coffee.
Is something like this more clear?
static inline int pspace_task_visible(struct pspace *pspace, struct
task_struct *tsk)
{
	if (tsk->pspace == pspace)
		return 1;
	/*
	 * Init tasks straggle namespaces.  They have the explicit
	 * pspace of their parent, but are visible from thier
	 * children.
	 */
	if (pspace_child_reaper_is_task(pspace, tsk)
		return 1;
	return 0;
}
int pspace_child_reaper_is_task(struct pspace *pspace,
				struct task_struct *tsk)
{
	if ((tsk->pspace->child_reaper.pspace == pspace) &&
	    (tsk->pspace->child_reaper.task == tsk))
		return 1;
	return 0;
}
