I've been thinking about a new name, but don't like 
DMA_ATTR_STRICT_ORDERING. 
What I'm trying to do is to establish order (across 
a NUMA fabric) of DMA to different memory regions, i.e., 
DMA to memory region A forces all outstanding DMA (to 
memory regions B, C,....) to complete first.
DMA_ATTR_STRICT_ORDERING sounds like a PCI thing to me, 
and this is a NUMA interconnect thing.
