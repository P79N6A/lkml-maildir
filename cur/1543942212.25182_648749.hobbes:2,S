how to do you wanna write a new original Linux driver (modular or
built-in) without creating derivative work. This is not possible and due
to the fact that it is derivative work the driver becomes automatically
licensed under GPL. This is not a gray area.
The gray area that exists if you have code that was written for some
other operating system and licensed under some proprietary license in
the first place. And now that code is used in conjunction with a glue
layer to make it loadable as kernel module.

That is such a nonsense. Stop distributing FUD and start talking to a
lawyer. You are clearly under some weird impression what the GPL means
and what it implies.

If the developers say that this symbol can only be used in GPL code (and
with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL it is quite clear) then you have to obey to that
license or don't use this symbol at all.
If you use that symbol inside non-GPL (meaning you link at runtime) then
you are in violation of the GPL license. We can't make it much clearer.
