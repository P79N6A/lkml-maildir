Assuming ix86, what is read-only? Certainly the text section needs
to be marked execute!
So is it:
 	Execute-Only
 	Execute-Only, accessed
 	Execute/Read
 	Execute/Read, accessed
 	Execute-only, conforming
 	Execute-only, conforming, accessed
 	Execute/Read-Only, conforming
 	Execute/Read-Only, conforming, accessed.
(all from page 5-12 of ix484 programmer's reference)
????
You need to WRITE to the text segment to be able to load executables
(modules) and kernel threads. The user-mode code, children of `init`
need to have writable .text segments to be able to exec().
