Have you tested that?
Unless I misread arch/i386/kernel/setup.c, line 740 to 760, max_pfn is
the upper end of the highmem area, if highmem is configured.
For non-highmem setup, it's set to min(system_memory, 4 GB).
It was a local variable within setup_arch, and someone made it a global
variable.
I.e. max_pfn is 1 GB with Andre's setup.
His patch doesn't touch the bounce limit, the default limit from
blk_queue_make_request() is used: BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH, which is max_low_pfn.
max_low_pfn is 896 MB.
--> BUG in create_bounce(), because a request comes in with a bounce
limit less than the total system memory, and no highmem configured.
