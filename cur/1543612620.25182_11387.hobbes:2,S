Subject: [PATCH] Athlon bug stomper UPDATE (as per VIA's Windows patch)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/12/7/215

This patch detects the 0305, 3099, 3102, and 3112 (KT133x, KT266x, VT8662,
and KLE133) *only*. On these chipsets, it will patch register 55 in the
Northbridge and turn off bits: 5, 6, AND 7.  (It does this to register 95
on the KT266x Northbridge). This will supposedly switch off a Memory Write
Queue timer, which can cause those infinite loop bugs and other assorted
crashes.  This patch works just like a similar patch that VIA recently
released for Windows machines.
The difference between this patch and the original athlon bug stomper is
that it is expanded to recognize more chipsets and also does a special
case for the KT266x chipset.
The attached patch is similar to one already submitted to the mailing
list, except I think it's a bit more elegant as it doesn't create a whole
new function for stomping the kt266 register 95, but rather instead used
the existing athlon bug stomper function in pci-pc.c and simply overloads
its functionality. (More efficient in that it has fewer lines and less
generated binary code).
I tested this patch on my KT266 motherboard and it seems to work
correctly.  Essentially no harm can be done by this patch, as most of the
time those registers have those bits turned off anyway.  Only some BIOS's
set those bits incorrectly and thus can cause problems.
