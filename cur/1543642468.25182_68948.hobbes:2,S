The point is to get away from using character devices where we don't need
them (and we really don't need them in most places).  Plus, there's no
dependency on devfs with this approach.

Oh, I'm quite aware of the limitations of my driver.  I just don't
want to see yet another character device + ioctl interface going into
the kernel when it's really not necessary.

Right, but it should probably be addressed as /dev/ipmi since what we're
doing is sending IPMI messages.
