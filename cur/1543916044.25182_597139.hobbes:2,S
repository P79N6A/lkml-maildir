Hi,
   I think it would be a bad idea to use Git as a part of filesystem. If 
someone wants to install it and use it, its his choice, but if we make 
it the part of Filesystem, and just use it for compression, this will 
reduce the performance.
   For compression, i think more preferable is to make a patch for ext3 
that implements the compression, like compression patch for ext2.
    On the other hand I liked the idea that we can have a Git based file 
system with special (non-standard) features. Why not provide the 
features like repository and other Git features in normal file system.
Thanks,
-- Tayyab
