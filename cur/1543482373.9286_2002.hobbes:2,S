  Not for the default setup. Guess why the default setup is the default
  setup?
If the default setup is only correct for PAGE_OFFSET == 0xC0000000, then why
did you permit the comment in page.h telling precisely how to change it to a
value that violated this assumption?
  We also currently accept things like
	  readb(0xA0000);
  ie the "legacy ISA region" is currently (for backwards compatibility
  reasons) not required to be io-remapped.
I had assumed that the legacy ISA region was also mapped at PAGE_OFFSET, in
which case the above readb would still work properly.  I should have noticed
that the change to traps.c invalidated this assumption.
Despite the fact that it happens to work with the current PAGE_OFFSET, it still
feels conceptually wrong that one takes the result of ioremap, a kernel virtual
address, and then applies __io_virt to it.  It may be clever that __io_virt
works for both the legacy ISA I/O and ioremap cases with the default
PAGE_OFFSET, but it's certainly confusing combined with the comments about
changing PAGE_OFFSET.  It wouldn't surprise me if other driver authors spend
time researching bug reports when people change PAGE_OFFSET and the driver
breaks.
  NOW do you understand why I use binary and/or and force the power-of-two
  rule?
Alas, yes.  If there is a power of two rule, it should surely be documented in
the code.  The existing code in page.h encourages people to make improper
changes.  The only other value I know of that works correctly is 0x80000000.
