Like I said, I'm trying to put together a set of "feature requirements"
that we can publish to LKML and get feedback. I am lead to believe that
they basically want to trap every file operation, of every potential
userspace program, so I don't think it's a handful at this point.

Oh, I meant that if it was just Samba we'd all be home and dry by now.

Yeah. I know, I'm trying not to flog a dead horse here, but I think
there's real genuine interest here this time around. So, maybe I'm just
trying because everyone else already did, but it's worth a shot :-)
