I see a similar error on my brand new IDE disk (IBM-DJNA-371800) running
2.2.11 on a Tyan Thunderbolt, which also has the PIIX4 chipset.

Most of the time it happens a few times a day, however a few times it
wedged the machine.  Before it died klogd consumed 100% cpu.  Maybe
generating the message causes klogd to write to the disk which causes the
error to repeat.
I did a fsck blockcheck and it didn't find and problems with the disk.
     Any ideas?
