First, I'd like to say please, no, everyone can benefit from _every
change_ you want to make in your tree, and it's not just an 'embedded'
issue.
Second, please look up the archives (this past June -> August maybe?)
for the CONFIG_TINY thread.  Under that was my TWEAKS idea.  If this
sounds useful to you, I can try and dig up the last patch I had that got
all of the dependancy stuff correct, except that you had to run a
command if you changed a TWEAK value.
