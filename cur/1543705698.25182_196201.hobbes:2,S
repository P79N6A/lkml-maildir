What about adding a pcibios_add_platform_entries(device) called by
pci_sysfs then ? By default an empty inline on asm/* and on PPC,
I can add my devspec without having OF-aware code in drivers/pci
Also, if you prefer a different name for "devspec", speak up now ;)
I can still change the name in the macio devices too, nothing uses
them right now and I expect things that will be fixed to use them
to rely on 2.6.3 minimum.
Ben.
