Hi all:
  Is there any way to umount a referenced and mounted filesytem, without
knowing which one is using the filesystem ?
  For example, if someone telneted into the system and is using the
floppy,
and the superver wants to eject the floppy and puts another disk into
it.
How could he achieve this goal without killing someone's process ?
Could we use patched device driver and filesystem to fix this problem ?
Thanks in advance.
With regards.
Alex
