Um, I had the same problem with the kernel when I first downloaded it to try it out.
I was stumped for a while, turning of a number of features in the kernel,
before I figured it out.  You need to switch the processor type the kernel is compiled
for from "P-III"  to whatever is apropriate for your Celeron (I used a P-II, which
is basically the same instruction set as Celeron in Linux's view).
I didn't look at the source, but I bet early on the kernel tries to execute a P-III
instruction when compiled for P-III, and the P-II or Celeron gets confused and shuts down.
Once I compiled with P-II, kernel booted A-OK to multiuser :-)
