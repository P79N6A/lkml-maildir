Try this with Mutt:
./configure --enable-flock --disable-fcntl
This may help you but I can't be certain.
I highly doubt this will make a difference but you could also try
--enable-nfs-fix
I use mutt exclusively although I don't use NFS mounted mailboxes.
The most recent mutt I know of is mutt-0.95-3 so if you are using an older
version, you might try the new one.
