	   So other distro's did it too.  Why did nobody complain till
   RedHat did it?  Because no one else decided to use, as the default,
   a bleeding edge compiler that not only won't compile the kernel but
   won't even touch a lot of userspace code either.
The topic is this thread is whether "kgcc" as a seperate compiler for
the kernel is a "Red Hat thing".  You stated that it is, I am showing
you how it isn't.  Please don't change the topic.
Red Hat's selection of it's userland compiler is an entirely different
topic and there have probably been a few hundred seperate flame wars
on this matter.  Such a discussion does not belong here on the kernel
list.  FWIW, I will be one of the first people to say that there were
some errors of judgment in the decision making that went on there.
