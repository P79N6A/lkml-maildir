I think Pavel Machek may have already written something like this?

In modern machines it shouldn't be too bad -- but if you are concerned
about it, a better course may be to at least put your interrupt handler
in kernel space.
Another possibility is have your user space driver pass information to
/dev/irq, which tells the generic /dev/irq how to acknowledge
interrupts, read data into a buffer, and other simple operations like
that.
