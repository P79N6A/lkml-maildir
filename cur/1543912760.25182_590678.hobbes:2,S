i agree.  and the reason for that is that people use that qualifier
liberally and never get rid of it.  not that long ago, i posted to the
janitors list and suggested that, as a project, people peruse the
source tree and find stuff marked EXPERIMENTAL that's clearly been
stable for years, and remove that dependency.  i personally submitted
a patch that removed that qualifier from the ATM stuff.
the *idea* of EXPERIMENTAL is not the problem -- the problem is that
people apply it and ***never take it off again***.

ok.  so, at this point, i think it's safe to drop the whole idea,
since more than enough people don't like it or, conversely, they like
it but seem adamant about butchering it badly to the point of
uselessness.
