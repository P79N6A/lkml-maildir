Has there been a verdict on this.  Are we going to 
a) leave Linux "as-is" and be different than the man pages and POSIX as
well as pretty much every other Unix out there.  But..., we keep from
breaking any linux-only applications out there that actually depend on
this behaviour (if there were any).
b) add the patch (in -mm or early 14 or later), see if any applications
break, but we will finally match the man pages and etc.
Just curious.
