It will work almost always, except cases where administrator set different
preffered sources in local routes.
I.e. it is indeed a very good approximation, but autofs shouldn't still hang
or do nasty things if the check with the datagram socket shows that address
isn't local, but in reality it happens to be local.
A subtle misbehavior or loss of efficiency are acceptable, in my opinion.
Theoretically, it might be possible to create a configuration which gives
false positive in this check, but I can't see how it may be harmful...
