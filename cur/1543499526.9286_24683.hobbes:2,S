I'm running the same compiler, and there is *definately* a problem with
ext2 for me whenever I run 2.2.10.  On booting up I get numerous ext2
errors while /etc/rc.d tries to load, and then, after maybe a few minutes,
I can't write to the disk because I get a drive full error, and I have 2.5
gigs free.  2.2.7 does not give me any problems however.
