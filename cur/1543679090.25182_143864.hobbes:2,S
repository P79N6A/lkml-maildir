I've proposed this before and nobody listened but maybe this time...
I think what you want is a bug database which distinguishes between
filed bugs and reviewed bugs.  You want to capture all bug reports, 
as Alan says (he's right, there is no question about it, you need to
capture the data).  You also want an *automatic* way for bugs to just
rot.  Anyone can file a bug but unless someone with expertise in the 
area reviews the bug and agrees to do something about it, the bug rots.
It's level 1 (capture) and level 2 (we really need to do something about
this some day).  Level 1 will have zillions of duplicates and tons of 
other noise.  Level 2 should be a small list, no duplicates, carefully
managed.
