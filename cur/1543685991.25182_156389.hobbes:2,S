You can here see the problem... not all tv cards use the same remote,
the switch doesn't work with my remote for example, so we have 2
possibilities:
a) hardcode all the possible remotes adding these as new one come up,
this is a big work in the kernel source, and also we lost compatibility
with remotes that use the same frequency of the ones with the tv card,
and that now can be used.
b) create an userspace utility that read the input layer for codes an
then translates them in user-definable commands. This is what lircd do
now...
IMHO, the solution used now is the more flexible of the two.
