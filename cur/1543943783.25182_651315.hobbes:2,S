Subject: [PATCH] libata: Forcing PIO0 mode on reset must not freeze system

Calling ap->ops->set_piomode(ap, dev) on a device/controller which got
already removed, locks the system hard. Reproducibly on an X60 attached to
a dock station containing a cdrom device with doing
  $ echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/dock.0/undock && echo 123 > /dev/sr0
This calls ata_eh_reset(...) which in turn tries to force PIO mode 0. But
the device is already gone.
Bisecting revealed the following commit as culprit:

      libata: relocate forcing PIO0 on reset
      
      Forcing PIO0 on reset was done inside ata_bus_softreset(), which is a
      bit out of place as it should be applied to all resets - hard, soft
      and implementation which don't use ata_bus_softreset().  Relocate it
      such that...
      
      * For new EH, it's done in ata_eh_reset() before calling prereset.
      
      * For old EH, it's done before calling ap->ops->phy_reset() in
        ata_bus_probe().
      
      This makes PIO0 forced after all resets.  Another difference is that
      reset itself is done after PIO0 is forced.

ATTENTION! The following patch solves the problem on my system, but please
be aware that I don't really know what I'm doing because I don't have the
big picture. There's surely a better way to check if the device/controller
is still functional than calling ata_link_{online,offline}.
