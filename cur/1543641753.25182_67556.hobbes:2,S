Ok, that seems to clinch it - that definitely means that the floppy driver 
is confused by non-512-byte buffers. And that in turn is almost certainly 
due to some subtle bug in the bio rework.
The only bug I really fixed in 2.5.33 was completely unrelated, and had to
do with the setup for the block open() routine not setting up the request
queue - which caused problems for the media change logic.
