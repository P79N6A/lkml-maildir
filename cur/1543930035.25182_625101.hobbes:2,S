Subject: [PATCH] Enabling the echo of ctrl-C (and the like)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/6/250

Attached is a patch that turns on INTR/QUIT/SUSP echoing in the N_TTY
line discipline (e.g. ctrl-C will appear as "^C" if stty echoctl is set
and ctrl-C is set as INTR).
Linux seems to be the only unix-like OS (recently I've verified this on
Solaris, BSD, and Mac OS X) that does *not* behave this way, and I
really miss this as a good visual confirmation of the interrupt of a
program in the console or xterm.  I remember this fondly from many Unixs
I've used over the years as well.  Bringing this to Linux also seems
like a good way to make it yet more compliant with standard unix-like
behavior.
The fix is pretty trivial.  Let me know if you think this is a candidate
for inclusion in the kernel.
					Thanks, Joe
