I experienced lost of the signal when switching from X to the console
when booting with vga=ext or some of the graphic modes. It was reported
here that the problem was the Matrox drivers.
Recently, with kernel 2.4.4+ and XFree 4.0.3 (@1280x1024/head)+ Matrox
drivers (
http://matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/linux_06.cfm
) and
booting with vga=794 (1280x1024) I have not had problems. I've a G450.
