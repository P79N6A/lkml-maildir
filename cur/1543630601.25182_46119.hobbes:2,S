no this is not true. I use busybox plus devfs and it works perfecly read
only. Or you can run the entire system out of an initrd which you can
of course write to if you want to write (it makes some things a little
easier). You can always mount /tmp with tmpfs if you want some write space.
Unable to open an initial console sounds to me like dev is not populated.
Have you got /dev/console and /dev/tty0? I do recommend devfs for this
type of thing, as it makes scripting your initial installer easier (you
can loop over /dev/hd* and so on).
