Many people find that to be the case.

It seems that most folks are able to live with the larger MTU.  The fast
speed of today's modems means that the time difference to transfer a
296-byte packet, vs. a 1500-byte packet is somewhere near 300 ms. 
Certainly measurable, but not like it was in the 2400-baud days.

Many people see this without diald in the equation, so I believe it is a
problem in the IP refragmentation code, but I don't think anyone is
actively trying to solve this problem.

Performance might be degraded, but is it that much?  Is there some way
to work around it using TOS settings of ipchains?
