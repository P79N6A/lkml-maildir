Hello everyone.
 I had an idea the other day that would require kernel autoconfig'ing
(at compile-time), so I was wondering... Would it be possible to include
a program in the kernel src tarball that could (after being compiled for
the hardware it's on) probe for hardware that the new kernel would
understand, but the old one doesn't?  I don't know about the
implementation details of doing something like this, but I would imagine
that it would be quite non-trivial.
Something like this would be _very_ nice for end-users (read:
non-techie's), and many distro's could probably make use of it in some
way or another (specifically, auto-updating the kernel (just nice gcc &
make to about 20... ;-) )
