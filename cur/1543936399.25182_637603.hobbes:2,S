Care to rename it to ide_floppy_get_flexible_disk_page() while at it
(it has only one user)?

some CodingStyle nitpicks (not really that important, rather personal taste):
	u16 transfer_rate, sector_size, cyls, rpm;
	u8 heads, sectors;

This is not an equivalent transformation:
header->wp is 0 or 1
pc.buffer[3] & 0x80 is 0 or 0x80
It seems to work fine for ->wp (because it is needlessly defined as 'int')
but may seriously confuse set_disk_ro() and thus bdev_read_only() users.
Should be fixed to '(pc.buffer[3] & 0x80) ? 1 : 0' (or something similar).

IDEFLOPPY_MEDIA_CHANGED is set when block device is opened for the first
time (please check idefloppy_open() for details) so I don't think it is
the right change.  'Flexible Disk Page' is only 32 bytes so we are better
off with leaving 'u8 flexible_disk_page[32]' in idefloppy_floppy_t and
doing things the old way.
Besides please do not intermix real changes like the above one with purely
cleanup ones like idefloppy_flexible_disk_page_t removal.  This is bad from
maintainability point of view.  If some patch causes problems it is easier
to narrow it down by heaving purely cleanup changes separated out + if we
would need to revert the real change we would have to make a separate patch
doing it instead of just reverting the guilty commit (given that we don't
want cleanup changes to be reverted as well).

more CodingStyle nitpicks:
		printk(KERN_INFO "%s: %dkB, %d/%d/%d CHS, %d kBps, "
				 "%d sector size, %d rpm\n",
				 drive->name, capacity / 1024, cyls, heads, sectors,
				 transfer_rate / 8, sector_size, rpm);
would be more readable IMO

extra newline would distinguish the above block from the code below

Otherwise looks fine, please recast and resubmit.
