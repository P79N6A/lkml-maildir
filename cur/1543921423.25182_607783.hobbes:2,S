I have been unable to make heads or tails of the maze of twisty 
dependencies that VirtualBox wants, but the fact that it gets to line 23 
of <asm-generic/atomic.h> means it has gotten past:
     21  #if BITS_PER_LONG == 64
     22
     23  typedef atomic64_t atomic_long_t;
BITS_PER_LONG was originally set in <asm/types.h>:
     39  #ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
     40  # define BITS_PER_LONG 32
     41  #else
     42  # define BITS_PER_LONG 64
     43  #endif
The most obvious reason for failure is that the symbol CONFIG_X86_32 
isn't being defined where expected.  From that point on everything goes 
to hell.
Have you done "make oldconfig && make prepare" in your kernel tree since 
you last updated it?
