Subject: i8k support changed from 2.6.0-test7 to 2.6.0-test8?

I have a Dell Precision M60 laptop (effectively, a souped-up Latitude D800).
I have tried just about every single 2.6.0-test*-bk* kernel (because
this laptop BIOS does not support apm and has a lot of new, unrecognized
hardware, I keep upgrading kernels every day or two...)
I have used with success under all 2.6.0-testx kernels so far the
"Dell laptop support" (i8k) to enable me to control the fans and the
volume buttons (with the i8ktools package; the fan control is
particularly useful, because the M60 BIOS insists on running the fans
all the time to keep the temp below 45C -- so it's noisy and has bad
battery life).  The i8k support complains that it cannot recognize my
laptop model, but it works just fine (if used as a module, it has to
be forced in for that reason).
I normally compiled support directly into the kernel, not as a module.
The last kernel for which this worked was 2.6.0-test7-bk8.
Two days later, the 2.6.0-test8 came out; I installed it with the same
configuration; the result is: "no such device".  I recompiled with
i8k set up as a module to look more carefully at what happens
when I insert it.  I get the same error message:
     insmod: error inserting 'i8k': -1 no such device
I have yet to do a diff between the two sources to find out what
changed; but I would humbly request that support for the i8k module
remain in 2.6.x kernels -- it is very useful.
