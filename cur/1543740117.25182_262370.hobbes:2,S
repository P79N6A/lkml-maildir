I think you can't trust what vm86()/vm86old()
returns, concerning strace. These 2 syscalls
returns different non-zero values on *success*,
which, I think, strace just doesn't get right.
Of course it can also return the reasonable
errors, like EFAULT as in your test program -
its just that copy_from_user() failed when
you specified NULL.
I am not sure where exactly the ENOSYS comes
from. My wild guess is that strace expects
0 on success and the negative value on error,
but any positive value is an indication that
the syscall is not implemented.
At least I've always seen ENOSYS in an strace
logs for vm86() - this is normal.

Sorry for not being able to help much.
