Read the IIS rationale for not contacting Apache.
For a different perspective, ask some folks who are involved in the
current IIS issue.  There are many reasons nowadays to restrict
information to non-citizens.
I'm not saying that this is reasonable, but there will always be
people unable to make a rational, informed decision, and if things get
irrational, those without the big pockets tend to lose.
Anyway, the current way security issues are handled will last a year,
maybe two.  I'm not sure in which direction it will evolve, either far
more anarchistic (unlikely), or completely regulated (very likely, I
smell a lot of money down that road).

I'm not in a position to judge this because the process is too closed.
But in general, they seem to do a good job, I agree.

I don't think things were different if the issues were revealed in a
coordinated manner in June or July.  You can't really fix it anyway
and my Kerberos guru tells me that the community has known for ages
that Kerberos 4 was broken at the protocol level.  Nobody was bothered
enough to write it down, though.
And CERT/CC deliberately leaks stuff to unrelated parties, you know.
This time, you just don't have to pay for it.
