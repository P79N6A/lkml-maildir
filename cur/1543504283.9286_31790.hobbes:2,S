 Memory problems are often timing-sensitive, and timing does vary,
sometimes subtly, sometimes greatly. I know that when I had the problem I
described, I could compile the kernel roughly two times out of three. I
never got past five kernel compiles without a seg fault or even disk cache
corruption.
After I swapped the memory, I compiled 80 kernels in a row without a
single fault. I consider that cured.
 As the Sig-11 FAQ (
http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/
) states:
-------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION
Does it only happen when I compile a kernel? 
ANSWER
Nope. There is no way your hardware can know that you are compiling a
kernel. It just so happens that a kernel compile is very tough on your
hardware, so it just happens a lot when you are compiling a kernel.
Compiling other large packages like gcc or glibc also often trigger the
sig11. 
     People have seen "random" crashes for example while installing using
     the slackware installation
     script.... -- dhn@pluto.njcc.com 
     Others get "general protection errors" from the kernel (with the
     crashdump). These are usually in
     /var/adm/messages. -- fox@graphics.cs.nyu.edu 
-------------------------------------------------------
 I will also note that memtest86 found no problems with the system. Kernel
compiling was the most reliable way to reproduce the problem on my system.
