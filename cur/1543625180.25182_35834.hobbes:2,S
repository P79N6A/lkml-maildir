This is a repost of the ptrace patch to 2.4 kernels
we've discussed in recent months.
Since the last post, I have updated it to linux 2.4.18
(no changes) and tested it with subterfuge and uml. 
Subterfuge seems to be unaffected.
UML needs minor modifications; I've discussed them with
Jeff Dike and (I believe) he is happy.
I believe I have addressed everyone's concerns.
The patch fixes these two bugs:
    1. gdb and other tools cannot attach to a stopped
    process.  The wait that follows the PTRACE_ATTACH
    will block indefinitely.
    2. It is not possible to use PTRACE_DETACH to leave
    a process stopped, because ptrace ignores SIGSTOPs
    sent by the tracing process.
