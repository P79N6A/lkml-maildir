Text is text is text for many propertiers, in particular
the ones you actually end up wanting to modify.
The biggest and most used example are the device aliases
and the 'boot-device' and 'boot-file' environment variables.
We even have a special case for that latter case on sparc
via:
	echo 'foo.image' >/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd
In order for a problem to exist, you have to show counter
examples where the problem triggers and something fails.
What in userspace wants to modify a OFW property, which
is not text?
In my experience all such cases are limited to ASCII text
valued properties, such as device aliases, environment
variables, and things like nvramrc.
