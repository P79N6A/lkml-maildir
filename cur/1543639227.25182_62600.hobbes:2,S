Let me repeat ... this is NOT caused by the nvidia module.
I have no such card and no such module built. I want to
help solve the problem but I'd prefer this thread not to
be an Nvidia bashfest. Bash Nvidia & co. all you want, but
let's not throw this baby out with the bathwater because it's not
caused by the NVidia module.
