If I'm not mistaken, as it is now, requests are not grouped in any way.
The only hint that a firmware loading request is in progress are a couple
of files in the device directory in sysfs. Should I run, at boot, through
all the device directories to check which firmware requests are pending?
Also, this could pose problems if two drivers can handle a device but
the first that gets to bind to it needs firmware and userspace doesn't
provide it or cancel the loading. The device will remain bound without
giving the other driver a chance to handle it.
Anyway, I think something must be done, either removing the timeout and
making all firmware requests asynchronous, or at least skipping the
delay when we're sure that it's useless.
