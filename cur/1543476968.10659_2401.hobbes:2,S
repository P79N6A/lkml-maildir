hello,
	I'm not too sure about the use of this bit of code,
but if the problem is overflow (i.e. timeout*HZ > 31 bits) then
the problem could be fixed by throwing away a couple of bits
of resolution (which doesn't really happen in practice) by using
the following line.
	timeout = (timeout*(HZ/4)+249)/250 + 1;
cheers
