Al, I've told you that the races will be fixed. Calm down. I know you
take a very theoretical and hard-line approach. All I said was that
the races aren't causing problems for people in real life. That's why
some vendors are using it. I never disagreed with you about the
existence of the races.
Peace, OK?

Yeah, 10 months during which I've gone to 7 conferences/workshops,
written 2 papers, moved house twice, took two holidays (sorry, I have
a life), moved/split/unsplit our lab network twice, caught the flu at
least once, and sundry other distractions. Pardon me for being busy.

The claim that splitting it into pieces will be an improvement is just
hand-waving. I've not seen a solid argument that shows how it will
help. Especially not after I remove the FS database code in devfs and
just use the dcache to store my tree. That will trim the code by 50%
or more. I'm going to wait and see how my next versions of devfs turn
out before I make any hard claims.
