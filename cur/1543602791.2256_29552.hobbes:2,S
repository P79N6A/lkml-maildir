Between 2.4.9-ac10 and 2.4.9-ac16 two small changes were made to
the PnP BIOS code.  One of them must be the cause of your troubles.

Initial suspicion may fall on your BIOS.  However, if the
PnP BIOS driver worked before then that means that we ought
to be able to work around any bugs in it.
Please try this patch to drivers/pnp/pnp_bios.c (attached) and get
back to me.
It would be helpful too if you could track down (using printks)
where the fault occurs.
