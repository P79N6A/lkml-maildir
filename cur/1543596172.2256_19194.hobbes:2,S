Better re-read the fine print on the "fair-use" statement. BOTH DSL and
Cable, or dialup (New Orleans at least) will disconnect you if you run ANY
unattended operation (if they determine it IS unattended). No daemon services.
No routing/NAT (unless they do it). No remote login. No mail. DHCP reconfig
between 4 and 8 hours (or whenever they choose to).
They will let you plug in, but will not provide any support (even TCP/IP is
not assured).
