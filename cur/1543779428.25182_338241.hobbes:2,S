That's a point I missed. The D-cache flushing should take place on the
CPU that wrote the page, not the one that got the page fault (and the
I-cache invalidation on all the CPUs). I don't see why this wouldn't
work.

On this ARM SMP implementation, only the D-cache snoops the other CPUs
stores, not the I-cache.

Shouldn't flush_dcache_page() be called anyway when a page is modified
by the kernel (or by a device via DMA)? With the Harvard cache
architecture in ARM, the I cache should be invalidated even in a
uniprocessor system. For SMP it is just a matter of invalidating it on
all the CPUs (done by issuing an inter-processor interrupt).

IMHO, it only needs invalidating the I-cache corresponding to the
DMA'ed page, not the whole I-cache but, as I said, this should be
handled by flush_dcache_page, whether lazily or not.
