I also have this exact combination of motherboard and cpu and I experience
the same problems: when the processor is in "performance" mode, the
system works perfectly (I have 3 months+ uptime on it). As soon as
I lower the speed (either manually, or automaticaly using some kernel
or userspace daemon), random processes get killed (X, gcc etc with
signal 11), and sooner or later the system hangs.
Since this is my main workstation (and I don't really need cpufreq)
I haven't done much testing. I also mainly run RedHat (FC3) kernels
on this box.
