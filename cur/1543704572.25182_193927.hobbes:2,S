Hello, David
I downloaded 2.0.39 from kernel.org, and find that the file 
drivers/char/baycom.c is a zero sized.
Also see this 
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/char/baycom.c?v=2.0.39
Only Documentation/magic-number.txt describes:
BAYCOM_MAGIC        0x3105bac0  struct baycom_state  drivers/char/baycom.c
also thanks to Segher Boessenkool
