printf can be changed, declare can be changed. Ideas for agnostic 
functions would be appreciated.

Not acceptable, perhaps --junkoption will suffice

Because I'm not a bash guru and I'm trying to keep it as simple.

Fixed, thank you

Will be fixed, thank you

This is one of the two big problems with this script.  'kbd' and 
'console-tools'  are developed in parallel.  console-tools was forked 
from kbd when the console-tools author felt the kbd author wasn't being 
responsive or accepting updates to the kbd package.  Both kbd and 
console-tools vary significantly even within themselves as to version 
reporting.  I would like to get a large number of responses on this one 
to develop a more accurate reporting of both  kbd and console-tools.

Because it doesn't work as well as I want it to.  The previous writers 
of this script wrote it based on their choice of distribution and 
installed packages.  There has always been one or more strange outputs 
or breakage when I run it .  All of my software is compiled from 
original tarballs or cvs from the original author.  That means if the 
script doesn't detect it correctly, then the script is trying to detect 
a mutation of the original source, i.e. a package from a distribution.
This means that the script needs to evolve because different 
distributions are going to have differing results.
I strongly agree that "--version" woud make life pretty simple here, but 
unfortunately (i.e. kbd and console-tools).
In a side note, if anybody has a reliable way of getting pppd to 
-always- report the version number, please tell me.  To get it to fail, 
put some junk in /etc/ppp/options, i.e. a not currently existing modem 
device such as /dev/usb/acm/0.
Thank you for your feedback,
David
