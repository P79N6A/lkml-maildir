People can grab the repository for use with CSSC from:
	
ftp://nl.linux.org/pub/linux/bk2patch/
Or using rsync:
	rsync -rav --delete nl.linux.org::kernel/linux-2.4 linux-2.4
	rsync -rav --delete nl.linux.org::kernel/linux-2.5 linux-2.5
Currently these repositories are updated every two hours, but if
there is a large demand I could update it every hour or even every
30 minutes.  Don't feel ashamed to put the above rsyncs into your
crontabs, grab the source and use it ;)
have fun,
Rik
