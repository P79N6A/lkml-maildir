Hi,
I am looking into possibly tuning the bdflush code in the kernel (under
fs/buffer.c).
If a lot of random I/O is being flushed to disk, or just multiple writers /
scattered data, IDE disk performance seems to be poor due to (disk) time
spent seeking when writing back dirty buffers.
- If bdflush were to sort the buffer chain when woken, before flushing some
buffers to disk, the gains would be obvious. On a SCSI sub-system, this
would probably give little difference, but on IDE disks, flushing takes much
longer than the transfer rate of the disk x quantity of data to flush.
IMHO, IO bound operations would benefit significantly (eg gunzip'ing). I
expect the additional processor overhead not to be much, since bdflush isn't
woken all that often (every >5 secs under normal load?).
If it were a kernel compile-time option, systems with SCSI disk sub-systems
could disable this feature.
Any feedback?
