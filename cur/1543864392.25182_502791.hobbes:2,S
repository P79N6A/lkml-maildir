Good day.
I have a really big trouble with VIA-EPIA mainboards under Linux
2.6.19. After loading kernel Linux the RESET-circuit ceases to work
correctly.
At reset (by RESET-button or by Watchdog) the system begins to be
restarted, but hangs before occurrence of any BIOS-messages. Only a
power-off and then power-up can help. The problem has been reproduced
confidently and constantly, I has checked up about 20 mainboards (EPIA-
EN/C7 and EPIA-PD/C3).
I am sure, this is not a Linux-related problem, but error in hardware
design or BIOS-code. Because RESET-circuit must work always and be
independent from a running software.
VIA's support doesn't give any usable response. But now I just need
some workaround...
Does somebody has ideas?
I can make some tests or perform deep-debugging, but currently I don't
know where I could start from.
Thank in advance.
