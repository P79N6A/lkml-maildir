No, we don't.  The enter instruction is special because it *atomically* 
drops the stack and probes the stack pointer; if the instruction fails, 
then the stack pointer is rolled back, which is why the kernel needs to 
be aware of it.
We could add a redzone to i386 (and then get compilers to know about 
it), but we haven't already done so.  The difference is that we'd have 
to adjust the stack pointer before writing a signal stack frame. 
However, libc probably needs to be aware of this, because this zone 
needs to also be reserved for every stack in a threaded program.

Probably, although likely not much; x86 processors tend to need to 
optimize push/pop anyway.  However, as x86-64 shows, having a small 
redzone might be worth it.
