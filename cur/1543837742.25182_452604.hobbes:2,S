Subject: [PATCH for review] [48/145] x86_64: Remove old "focus disabled" chipset errata workaround
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/10/508

r
The new systems already use focus disabled and the comment was 
completely outdated.
