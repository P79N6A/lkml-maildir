may be you can write your own function... I had my implementation that 
works, it should for you too...  just take a look at the bottom.

	unsigned int inet_addr(char *str)
	{
	  int a,b,c,d;
	  char arr[4];
	  sscanf(str,"%d.%d.%d.%d",&a,&b,&c,&d);
	  arr[0] = a; arr[1] = b; arr[2] = c; arr[3] = d;
	  return *(unsigned int*)arr;
	}
