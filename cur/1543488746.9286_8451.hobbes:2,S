If it answers, it means that the interface is not down.
Apparently, he configured IP on eth1 earlier and did not disable it then.
"ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0" does not disable IP for bootp folks:
it still receives broadcasts and packets destined to addresses
of another interfaces.
IP is disabled either by explicit address deletion ("ip addr del")
or by dirty trick with ifconfig sort of:
ifconfig eth1:tmp 10.0.0.1
ifconfig eth1:tmp down
