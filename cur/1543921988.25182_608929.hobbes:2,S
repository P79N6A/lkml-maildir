Not at all - the present situation where GART specific code
masquerades as generic IOMMU code is confusing. I've heard from more
than one person who was confused by "how come I can enable an IOMMU
while CONFIG_IOMMU is off?" and "how come some iommu_xxx options
(which were really gart options...) don't actually affect the
(Calgary) IOMMU"?
If the variable names clash the correct solution is to s/gart/agpgart/
in the AGP code and then continue renaming gart specific bits 'gart'
rather than 'iommu'.
Cheers,
Muli
