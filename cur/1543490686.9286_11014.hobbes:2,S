You want people to write 
#!perl
instead of 
#!/path/perl
. Ok. Make them write 
#!/etc/shells/perl 
instead, and make sure /etc/shells contains right symlinks. No kernel
modification needed.
Or just make sure everybody has perl installed in /usr/bin or at least
has /usr/bin/perl -> /real/location/of/perl. [Right way, IMO]
