Yes - if you're going to give someone more than 2GB, you probably just
want to give them 'unlimited'.  Sure, you can't do clear limits between
2GB and 4GB (or whatever your total limit on address space is) but it
really won't make that much difference if you let some process squash 3GB
of your memory or just give it free reign.
