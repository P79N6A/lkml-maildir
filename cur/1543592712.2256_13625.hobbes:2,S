Just keep enough swap around.  How hard can that be ?
Really, it's not like a memory leak or something.  It's just "late reclaim".
If Linux didn't do over-commit, you wouldn't have been able to run that job
anyway.
It's not a bug.  It's a feature.  It only breaks systems that are run with "too
little" swap, and the only difference from 2.2 till now is, that the definition
of "too little" changed.
