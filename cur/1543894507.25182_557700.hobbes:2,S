The _exact_ same arguments are made against the GPLv2 by the BSD folks.
Given that many people here defend the GPLv2 over BSD, it's ironic
the tone and level of vitriol shown against the v3 and such a
willingness to use the same arguments the BSD folks use against v2.
Both v2 and v3 enforce some restrictions that people who want to
participate must obey.  And _yes_ I acknowledge that v3 has _more_
restrictions.  But then, v2 has more restrictions than BSD and we're
more or less happy with that, aren't we?  In fact, many of us
believe it's a virtue that Linux has a more restrictive license
than that of the BSD's.
While this isn't an argument that we should happily accept more
restrictions, hopefully it will put things in a cheerier perspective.
We're not talking about a fundamental disagreement (ie. no restrictions
versus any restrictions); we're simply talking about _degree_ of
restriction.
There's no problem with people voicing honest disagreement with the v3,
but please lighten up a bit on FSF bashing and the Greek tragedy talk.
Sean.
