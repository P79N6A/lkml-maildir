Oh, I would love to see that thing in the Standard-Kernel.... My 
Server at home uses Dial-On-Demand for my Internet connection and the 
beautiful Gillian Anderson is talking to me if the connection gets up 
("wow!") and down ("uuuhhh, you scare me") ;-))))
**THIS** is the only reason why I have a soundcard in my PC - just to 
get some accoustic information for a few events (another sample could 
be a finished backup, incoming mail from fetchmail, incoming faxes or 
incoming ISDN-Calls from friends...). 
For this your driver is more than enough! A "real" soundcard isn't 
necessary anymore (and PCI-Slots are always rare)..... This evening I 
will remove my old soundcard from my server!
Thanks for your work! This is something I was missing for years!
Bye
  Michael
