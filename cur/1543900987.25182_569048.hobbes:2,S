I'm a bit confused here.  Do you mean that the warning message
is not printed or that disk is not limited to UDMA33?
Could you send "hdb" part of 2.6.17 dmesg?

Please send output of "hdparm --Istdout /dev/hdb" command.
This is probably one of the early ATA66 disks with the buggy device side
cable detection.  CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB=y should help but I'm currently working
on adding automatic detection of such disks.
Thanks,
Bart
