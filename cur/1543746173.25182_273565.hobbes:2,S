OK, will do.
    Greg> No email address of who to bug with issues?
There's a patch to MAINTAINERS...
    Greg> Why is this packed?
    Greg> Same here?
Both of these structures unfortunately have 64 bit fields only aligned
to 32 bits (and are sent on the wire so we can't fiddle with the
layout).  So without the "packed" they won't come out right on 64-bit archs.
    Greg> Should this be global or static?
static, fixed.
    Greg> Oops, tabs vs. spaces.
fixed.

Sure, that's a good idea.  I'll look for other places we can do this too.

unfortunately some people marked it as spam and it didn't get
everywhere.
