Subject: 2.5.65: orinoco unregister_netdevice: usage count

While shutting down the PCMCIA service, I receive the following error:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth1 to become free. Usage count = 2
and the shutdown of PCMCIA is stuck at 'modprobe -r orinoco_cs'.
I had the same error in 2.5.64. There seems to be a problem unloading
the orinoco_cs module. Or do I have to upgrade the PCMCIA scripts?
Thanks,
Raf.
