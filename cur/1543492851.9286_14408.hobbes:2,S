My goal is not to provide true capabilities. My goal is to provide
usefull extension to elf headers in such way that it can be used now.

I do not see why setting inheritable set should be privileged.
In traditional unix, every utility has inheritable set set to FULL by
default. I do not think it is good idea to change that.

I just think that CAP_CHOWN should be set in nearly any utility,
including utilities users compile themselves.

I mean that utilities like tar _do not support_ bits like immutable,
today. So you could really add new flag 'capability enhanced' instead
of overriding immutable.
