Granted, but I don't expect any roll-back to happen. If Stephen can dig
up the best version VM-wise, then if somebody could benchmark 2.6pre
against 2.1.BEST, that might be a good competition to 2.6pre -- modulo
different application profile, of course.
My major concern is usability: VM can be so bad it freezes hell or so
good it brings instant world peace: It won't buy me anything if I cannot
get to my data because LVM1 is unusable and neither EVMS nor LVM2 is in.
I'd like to test-drive 2.5, but booting my kernel and mounting a small
root partition from ext3 (non-LVM) and going without /usr and /opt
(because these are in LVM) is not terribly helpful to give it a try.
It's some big things that must be fixed before the tuning (towards
stability, fixes, performance) can take place. You really can't do the
tasting before you've put the meat in.
