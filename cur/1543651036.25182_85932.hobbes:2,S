You say that linux needs swap=ram and old linux needs swap=2xram which is
not true. There is no "need" for swap size (like in BSD where you need to
have at least as much swap as you have ram).
If your system is doing a lot of memory intense work you may need swap space
up to dozents of gigabyte :)
Normally it is enough to have 1-2 times of your ram, if you have a normal
128-1gb system.
Swap usage can be monitored with the "free" command.

i would suggest you send it to the LDP (tldp.org) cause they will be
mirrored everywhere.
