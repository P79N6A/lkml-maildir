Btw, if you're willing to test some more, there's a much less intrusive
way to get basically the same behaviour:
 - duplicate the "getblk()" and "get_hash_table()" functions, calling the
   second set "bread_getblk()" and "bread_get_hash_table()". Make the
   second set "static", ie only visible inside buffer.c.
 - make bread_getblk() call bread_get_hash_table() rather than the old
   get_hash_table().
 - make bread() call bread_getblk() rather than the old getblk()
 - make the one-liner change only to the bread_get_hash_table() function.
   That way the change won't have any effect outside of "bread()", which
   is the only function I really wanted changed.
There's a lot of things calling "get_hash_table()", and that was why I was
nervous about the change - I didn't validate that they are all ok even if
get_hash_table() sometimes returns a locked buffer..
