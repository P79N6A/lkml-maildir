I reported some Oopses for earlier kernels, they are here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=113649735300003&r=1&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113166035904096&w=2
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=fedora-list&m=113611408900505&w=2
With FC3, the last kernel I used was vanilla 2.6.15.
It may be that those above were fixed since.
Best regards,
