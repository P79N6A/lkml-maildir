Great, that's certainly better than the speedtouch ;)
I can't help feeling that polling twice a second is overkill.
How about changing it to poll every 5 seconds if the line is
up, and ten times as fast (as in this patch) if the line is
down?  Also, what is the point of polling fast?  Does it matter
if you miss some down-try_to_activate transitions?
Best wishes,
Duncan.
