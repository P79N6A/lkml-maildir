    Hi Christoph -- a few comments on the patches:
cpuset_write_dirty_map.htm
    In __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() you always call 
cpuset_update_dirty_nodes() but in __set_page_dirty_buffers() you call 
it only if page->mapping is still set after locking. Is there a reason 
for the difference? Also a question not about your patch: why do those 
functions call __mark_inode_dirty() even if the dirty page has been 
truncated and mapping == NULL?
cpuset_write_throttle.htm
    I noticed that several lines have leading spaces. I didn't check if 
other patches have the problem too.
    In get_dirty_limits(), when cpusets are configd you don't subtract 
highmen the same way that is done without cpusets. Is this intentional?
    It seems that dirty_exceeded is still a global punishment across 
cpusets. Should it be addressed?
