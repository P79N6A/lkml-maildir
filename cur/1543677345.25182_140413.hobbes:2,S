ABS_NR_FINGERS and ABS_AREA ? I find ABS_FINGER_WIDTH to more telling.
The important part is that the driver must know when there is added or
removed a finger as touchpads sends the avarage positions of the fingers.
Adding or removing a finger moves the mouse if the driver does nothing.
There are other questions, if the API is to be used by a general user
touchpad driver. Is there a way to communicate the resolution of the x,y
and z coordinates to the user driver? (not only min/max). How do I tell
that the y coordinate is reversed (gliderpointer) ?
