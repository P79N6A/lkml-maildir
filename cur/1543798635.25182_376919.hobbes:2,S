For me it seems it is not so speculative. It really has effect when 
running with not-so-uber
memory/machine configuration.
After some big compile during lunch-time everything slowly crawls back 
to the screen when
I enter my password to unlock screen without these patches.
But with these applied I came back from my lunch and everything is as 
snappy as it was when
I left it.
This is with 256M of memory and old Duron CPU in machine. Hard disk 
being not too speedy either.
So, I'm really sorry to see these patches dropped instead pushing 
towards mainline.
