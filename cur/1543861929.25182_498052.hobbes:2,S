Ah, OK, I think I get it now, thanks for the clarification. I thought
that the quirks were processed in file order for all devices at once,
while I now understand they are processed for each device in turn. In
which case, indeed, as long as the host bridge PCI device is listed
before the ISA bridge PCI device (and as you suggest this appears to be
guaranteed), the Intel SMBus quirk will work fine, regardless of the
linking order.
