So what about the main advantage of SATA, that is hot-swap?
Is it possible to make hotswap in the linux and change it for the
same disk? Or is it possible to change it for other disk with other
geometry? Is it depending on SATA controller or I only need
support in the linux kernel? Is there that support for this
controllers/drives?
Thanx for the answer
