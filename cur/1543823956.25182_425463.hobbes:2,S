The other thing  I would observe is that clock speed is only part of the
equation, it's one thing to soak up some cpu cycles, but the cpu may be
a lot more superscalar (pipelineing, simd instructions, multiple cores
etc) than the one you're trying to simulate, probably it also has a lot
more cache and much faster memory. So that while you can certainly soak
up a lot of cpu pretty easily there are other considerations that might
effect simulating the performance of say a 100mhz pentium on say an
athlon 64x2.
emulation would probably go a lot further as an approach
