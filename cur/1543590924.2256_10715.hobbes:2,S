It's not so much about hardcoding the names as hardcoding the *STRUCTURE*
of the names.  For example, the current devfs has /dev/misc/* which is
completely bogus -- it exposes an implementation detail (using the
miscdev API as opposed to the charmajor API) which should be hidden; in
fact a number of drivers have started their lives as miscdev devices and
changed over time.
