It's metter of experiment to know how much spammers today
* compose messages with non outloock default headers
* have *valid* reply address
  ** if it's valid and message to get ticket looks spammy as well as message
     after ticket does, address gets blacklisted forever
* bother about published email address' policy

You know, after requests like "we need more man power to handle mail
lists" i wonder in what century we are leaving XXI or IIX?
OTHO Gmane is an excellent example of applying NNTP structure, that is
very superior to mailing lists concept. But as i mentioned, i don't know
whole story about USENET vs Mailing lists. I just speculate, that latter
was established as an private entity, that groups of people can handle as
they need and want.
But NNTP isn't USENET, and only Gmane shows how it lets people like me to
handle tens of thousand emails in nearly 60 mailing lists (not only
reading up to date, but archives easily). And frankly, i just pissed off
by "6 day lkml archive, please", "Adrian, your email is bouncing, bla
bla...". I'd better see spam, then dumb things like that, see?
