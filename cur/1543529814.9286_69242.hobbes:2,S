If you are still having problems with the 2.3.* CardBus stuff, I think
it would be particularly useful to post *both* messages with that
kernel, as well as the messages with the current standalone PCMCIA
drivers with a 2.2.* kernel.  That might point out resource allocation
differences that might be responsible for your problem.
The standalone PCMCIA drivers should, in principle, use interrupts
much the same way that the new yenta code does.  However, the two
drivers have very different ways of getting to what should be the same
end result.  The current (3.1.12) PCMCIA package also has a new
utility, "dump_pirq", that can be used to dump out your BIOS's PCI
interrupt routing information, as well as the current configuration of
your southbridge.
About the 3c574 card, Linus is right that it simply can't keep up with
a 100baseT data rate.  The "too much work" messages have been disabled
in newer drivers, because they are "par for the course" and are not
giving any useful information.
The 3c575_cb driver works fine with shared PCI interrupts.  It has not
been converted to use the new hot plug PCI API, but I've used it with
a 2.3.49 kernel, and haven't seen any problems.
