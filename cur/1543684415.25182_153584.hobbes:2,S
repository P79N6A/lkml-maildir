Hi.
I am developping a block device kernel module in 2.4 series.
And i want to make a distinction between raw I/O and block I/O,
in the request function i wrote for my module.
But i could not find the way.
my_request_fn(request_queue_t *q, int rw, struct buffer_head * bh)
Is it possible ?
I would be happy if someone give me a hint about this.
Regards.
