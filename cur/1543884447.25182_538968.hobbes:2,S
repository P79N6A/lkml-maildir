You bastard! :)
Ok, from a brief look ...
[general]
The code adds an extra indirection over the already existing 
file_operations, that IMO already sufficently abstract a file.
The compat code, if I read it correctly, does not support files crossing 
32/64 bits boundaries (exec or SCM_RIGHTS).
[timers]
Returns a structure instead of a 32 bit counter (ala timerfd), and needs 
extra compat code.
[signal]
All the discussions that went on for signalfd has been lost. It pins the 
task struct and it does not handle process detach signaling.
[aio]
I prefer a signaling-only approach like the 20 lines patch I posted, and 
use the standard AIO calls to fetch results. This code simply wraps AIO 
calls. This is just my opinions of course, and others may disagree.
[futex]
I intentionally stayed out of there after all the talks about futexfd 
being killed due to the impossibility of getting an interface right (did 
not follow the talk, so I can't tell the level of BS contained in the 
previous statement). We also have a nice printk in there, with the first 
kill-on deadline that ever made mainline :)
         printk(KERN_WARNING "Process `%s' used FUTEX_FD, which "
                "will be removed from the kernel in June 2007\n",
                 current->comm);
