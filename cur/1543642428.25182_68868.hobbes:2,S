Activities such as compiling the kernel or rcp large files on /dev/hda3

Yes, read-only on /dev/hda2, trying to change to read-write.

Using reiserfs on say /dev/hda2 200MB (/usr), mount initially as
read-only, another reiserfs /dev/hda3 800MB (/usr/src), mounted as
read-write, start compiling linux on /usr/src/linux, let it run for about
5 to 10 minutes, switch to another xterm and remount /usr as read-write
... then it may hang sometimes only. My PC is P3 1.13GHz, 650MB Ram, 30GB
hard disk. If the system is not heavily loaded enough, start rcp/cp large
amount of data from one partition to another or to another remote machine,
and remount /usr as read-only and it may hang.
Thanks,
Jeff.
