Actually, those aren't part of the e820 map at all - Linux gets those from 
doing PCI probing, since the e820 table does not itself tell _what_ the 
resources are allocated for.

Actually, it's already there, to some degree. See the case statement in	
register_memory() in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c, and see how all the e820 
information percolates down from the e820 array into a simple 
"request_resource()".
See also how we artificially only show 32-bit resources, because "struct
resource" uses "unsigned long". That's a design mistake, and it _should_
be "u64" (this actually could cause problems already on 64-bit PCI on
32-bit hosts, although it appears that nobody even tries to map devices
past the 4GB area anyway), but I've never had a test-case for fixing it
and seeing any difference.
In other words, I would suggest you fix that 64-bit issue, remove the
artificial limiting in setup.c, extend the "case" statement to cover any
cases you're interested in, and test it on something with >4GB of memory
to see that it works, and I'll be more than happy to take it.
Please?
