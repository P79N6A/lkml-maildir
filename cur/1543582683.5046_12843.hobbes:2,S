Neither "supercedes" the other -- they are different trees.  The -ac
series has some patches that Linus may never get because they are
experimental, or still buggy.
If you want stability, run the real Linus 2.4.  If you want all the
really minor bug fixes and more of the experimental code, run -ac.  If
you want production quality, run your kernel on a test server before
deploying.  (As always!)
