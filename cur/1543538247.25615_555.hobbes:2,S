And if it is our interrupt, we have to spend time servicing it. Even
with the best busmaster DMA, we have to spend time walking buffer
lists, locking (waiting!) and unlocking, moving list pointers around
and stuff like that. During this time:
- other interrupts may be disabled (to cope with broken hardware)
- rescheduling is prevented (no way around that).
Sure, with good hardware, we don't have to disable interrupts in our
ISR. But since there are people running broken hardware, we have to be
conservative by default. Because Linux is a general-purpose OS.
RTLinux doesn't have to be conservative this way. It doesn't have to
work around broken hardware ("Oh, it hangs? Go use decent hardware").
This is a key point I'm finding difficult to get across.
And RTLinux can also keep rescheduling RT tasks, which is important
even if you have decent hardware.
