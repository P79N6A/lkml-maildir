it's possible that it is the same old weak error-message which is explained
in some older PPP-FAQ if I'm not mistaken, it doesn't always mean that PPP
is not in the kernel or not as module, it can be another issue.
One of the other reasons IIRC is not having the correct permissions on 
/usr/sbin/pppd e.g.
this weak ppp-error should have been fixed ages ago ;-)
