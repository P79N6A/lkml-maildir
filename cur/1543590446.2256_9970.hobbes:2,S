SCSI Ultra-160 has CRC.
PCI has parity (btw, you think right), but only a few drivers make sure
PCI parity checking is enabled. On the other hand, a PCI parity error
should be considered as extremally serious and the system should be
stopped when such happens.
Btw, it seems (read at the pci list) that the original PCI hadn't parity.
After all, PCI had been designed for PC machines... :)
