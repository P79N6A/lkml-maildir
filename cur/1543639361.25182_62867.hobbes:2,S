Please don't.  Read Karl Popper instead.

The positivist Copenhagen interpretation stifled important areas of
physics for half a century.  There is a distinction to be made between
an explanatory construct (whereby I mean to imply nothing fancy, no
quarks, just a brick), and the evidence that supports that construct
in the form of observable quantities.  It's all there in Popper's work.

True, as far as it goes.  Measurement=good, idle-speculation=bad.
But it pays to keep in mind that progress is nonlinear.  In 1988, Van
Jabobsen noted (

):
   (I had one test case that went like
       Basic system:    600 KB/s
       add feature A:    520 KB/s
       drop A, add B:    530 KB/s
       add both A & B:    700 KB/s
   Obviously, any statement of the form "feature A/B is good/bad"
   is bogus.)  But, in spite of the ambiguity, some of the network
   design folklore I've heard seems to be clearly wrong.
Such anomalies abound.
