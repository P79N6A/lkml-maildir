Not that I ever do crack, I stick to the green stuff.. but, damn. I was
doing exactly that in DDD. I moved my mouse pointer over DDD's gdb window
and tried to type in something; BOOM, kernel went into orbit. Looks like
there's a nasty interaction between DDD/gdb and the kernel itself
(2.2.0-final) that sends it bye-bye. :o(
Note that gdb on its own works perfectly well. The problem's getting it to
log what's going on in the kernel's brains when it does that. Maybe Tux's
been at the crack again... ;o)
Which system library are you using? glibc-2.0.111? Or libc5? It might help
to narrow it down a bit futher so we can kill this bastard of a bug.
Cheers,
Alex
