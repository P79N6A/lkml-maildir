LVM doesn't handle the filesystem resizing, the filesystem tools do. The only 
thing you need is something in user-space to ensure the correct ordering. For 
an expand, the MD device must be expanded first. When that is complete, 
resizefs is called to expand the filesystem.
MD currently doesn't allow resize of RAID 0, 4 or 5, because expanding 
striped devices is way ugly. If it was determined to be possible, the MD 
driver may need additional support to allow online resize. But it is just as 
easy to add this support to MD rather than have to merge MD and DM.
