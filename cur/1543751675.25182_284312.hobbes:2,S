this looks like the agp backend isn't loading, Mike sent me parts of
your .config but I lost the mail (don't drink and read e-mail...)
make sure that the correct backend for your chipset is loaded (throw a
complete dmesg my way if you could.... I broke with tradition and
actually tested -mm2 on my own machine there now and I have a Radeon
9200 on an intel agp ...
