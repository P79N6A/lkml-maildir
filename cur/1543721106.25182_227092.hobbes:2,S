Every developer or maintainer of every
driver or other part of the kernel wants
every Linux user to use kdb etc.?
I sure hope not.

The information contained in the panic
reports is mainly useful to developers.
By not making the information visible
by default to end users, developers
avoid getting reports from end users.
Is this really what we want?  Do we
want to get reports only from failures
that we personally experience?
Although a particular big company is
famous for that attitude (including
not allowing end users to submit bug
reports unless we pay 4,200 yen to
make the submission), it's interesting
that their X Windows version sometimes
offers to call home with a crash report
after rebooting.  They're no longer
100% dedicated to closing their ears
to failures in the field.  Maybe Linux
isn't ready for this yet, but surely
we should not discourage reports from
end users?
