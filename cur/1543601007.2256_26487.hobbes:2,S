         2.4.7/3.x.0k-pre8 pair in _very_rare_ circumsistances
    gives tails corruptions with --rebuild-tree.
    Actually i found only one file filled with "." (ofcourse <4k)
         As a detail, on sudden reboots i have log tails filled with "."
    but it seems to be unrelated.
         It may look like this one file "." fill was caused by sudden
    inability to sync while corruption raised, but in fact at the moment
    when fs was corrupted i havent accessed this file for ages... (.c file)
Cheers, Samium Gromoff
