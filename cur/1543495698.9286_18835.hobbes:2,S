Was very excited about getting all the way through the kernel compilation 
for the first time on 2.3 with 2.3.1-4  Got it to boot up nicely and 
everything seemed fine.  Until I tried to start ppp.  Here's a snippet of 
the oops from /var/log/messages
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: registered device ppp0
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: bad magic 0 (should be c1d210ac, creator 0), 
wq bug, forcing oops.
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer 
dereference at virtual address 00000000
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 019e5000, %cr3 = 019e5000
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: *pde = 00000000
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: Oops: 0002
May 13 18:32:54 routine kernel: CPU:    0
My system is RedHat 5.1 p200 with 32MB RAM using ppp-2.3.5-1
Hope this helps for a stable 2.3.1  =)
Thanks,
	Tim
