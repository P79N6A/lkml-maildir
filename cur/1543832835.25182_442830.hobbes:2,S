I ran 'make menuconfig' and I got the same warnings. Perhaps CONFIG_FB needs 
to be part of the 'selects' line for any option that selects the backlight 
support. I think the USB Apple Cinema display support, which I set as 
modular, might have selected backlight. I don't need framebuffer support, so 
I have that shut off. Here are the depmod warnings once again:

I ran make menuconfig with the config file I sent before. The new config is 
attached.
