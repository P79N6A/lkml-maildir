No.  At least not of the boot console has the CON_BOOT flag set as it
should.  Last message you'll see on the boot console is the handover
printk, telling you which real console device prints the following
messages.  Whenever early and real console go to the physical device or
not doesn't matter.

Hmm, yes, should be doable in generic code.  Check whenever the current
console has CON_BOOT set and if so unregister it.
