Read it, wasn't impressed.
"On a modest system with 64 MBytes of RAM, the cost is under 0.1 percent.
The accusations of "bloatware" levelled at devfs are not justified."
By my calculations, that's 67,109 bytes.  That is larger than even
'scsi_mod'.

Even if we say 0.5%, it's still 33,554 bytes.  I think one of Alan Cox's
estimates (I could be wildly wrong, it's from memory) for /proc was ~68 kB.
So I fail to see a large improvement being 0.1% of a 64 MB machine. (I'd
give numbers but I haven't run the 2.3.x kernel with devfs yet.)
"A typical /dev has over 1200 nodes!"
So the admin is lazy.  Besides, it takes 0 memory when not being used.
Redhat 6.1 default /dev:
root@moving:~# ls -l /dev/ | wc
   2311   23131  141939
After deleting most of what I don't need:
root@moving:~# ls -l /dev/ | wc
    263    2640   16265
Currently all options suck equally.  I'm not advocating /proc for the data
(that'd be silly) but I am against a wholesale change from one dump to
another in the name of being "pretty" wit a more significant fix.
