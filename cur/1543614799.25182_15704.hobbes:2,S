I would love to do that, with each driver/filesystem/... having an
associated control file that defined its config options, its help and
who to make it.  That is, an "Insert New Facility" file, we could call
them driver.inf (ducks and runs ;).
There is one big problem in the way, makefile order controls link order
which controls init order.  I have no problem with the link order
controlling init order, that is far better than the old Space.c code.
I intensely dislike makefile order controlling link order, it results
in loss of information, we have makefiles in a specific order with no
idea about whether that order is required or is just accidental.
IMHO the link order should be divorced from makefile order and made
explicit.  Then you could have makefile fragments associated with each
driver.  But the last time I tried to break the dependency between make
and link order, Linus shot me down in flames[1], so I have no intention
of going there again.  As long as you have monolithic makefiles,
drivers.conf is going to be problematic.
