When the manual for your mainboard states that clock settings for setting
up your CPU creates a change in the normal idebus=33MHz of any other
value, then you are probablely safe.  Since all 32-bit PCI busses run at
33MHz, as last thought and reported, it should not be needed to change.
If I recall the idebus=XX primary use was for VLB/ISA/EISA systems, but I
have been wrong before.
