I pulled the chipset datasheet for CentaurHauls VIA
Samuel 2 stepping 2.
Two seperate i386/kernel/setup.c fixes things seems to
fix this chipset.
1.  Disabled the Branch Predictor in MSR_VIA_FCR
2.  cachesize=0
Other attempts to fix this were:
3.  Disabling L2 Cache OOP'd so that's not an option.
4.  Disables I-Cache (too slow)
5.  Disables D-Cache OOP'd
6.  Disables Page Directory Cache is a NOP.
I've settled for cachesize=0.
Hope this is not a trend here.
