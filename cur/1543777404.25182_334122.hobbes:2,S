Oh, but that's not quite what the code is doing, rather it is doing:
	rcu_read_lock
	while get next element from list
		inc element.refcount
		rcu_read_unlock
		do something
		rcu_read_lock
		dec refcount
	rcu_read_unlock
What I plan to try next is:
	rcu_read_lock
	while get next element from list
		if (element->owning_module->state != LIVE)
			continue
		rcu_read_unlock
		do something
		rcu_read_lock
	rcu_read_unlock

Most if not all of the codepaths can sleep, however.  So unfortunately
that doesn't seem a feasible solution.  That's why I'm hoping there is
something inherent in the module unload code that I can take advantage
of to forego my own refcounting.
