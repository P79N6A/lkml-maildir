I have some similar problems on 2.2.xx , and i do the following:
echo 65535 >/proc/sys/fs/file-max
and then in the scripts that start the programs:
ulimit -n 65535
And everyting is fine... Even better, you can use setrlimit() to set this
in your program...( and even do the echo ... > ... there :))) )
