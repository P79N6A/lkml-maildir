Ok, something to explain. These flags exists to allow drivers to 
manually configure (override) PnP resources at init time - we know - for 
example in ALSA - that some combinations simply does not work for all 
soundcards.
The DISABLE flags simply tells core PnP layer - driver will handle 
resource allocation itself, don't do anything, just disable hw physically 
and do not change (allocate) any resources. Value 0x03 is valid in this 
semantics.
Unfortunately, suspend / resume complicates things a bit, but PnP core can 
handle DO_NOT_CHANGE flag. But it will just mean - _preserve_ resource 
allocation from last suspend state for this device and enable hw 
physically before calling resume() callback.
