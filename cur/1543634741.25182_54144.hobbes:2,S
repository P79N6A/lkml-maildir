I've had a lot of problems with ALI15x3; the patch that let me boot
(found somewhere on the net, do not remember the original author)
commented out the pci_read_config_byte and two pci_write_config_byte
calls right below the comment that says "set south-bridge's enable
bit".  Recent -ac kernels have this in two places.  DMA still works
after doing that; does this work for you?
