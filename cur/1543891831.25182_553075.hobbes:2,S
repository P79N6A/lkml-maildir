Strictly that's required by POSIX anyways. But it's a real mess.
The problem is that you would need to reference count/lock them in every
syscall or ioctl or similar. Otherwise another thread
could change them in the middle of a syscall which wouldn't be
good. Doing this full reference counting would be probably somewhat
expensive with more locked cycles and also a lot of work to implement.
You would need to audit large parts of the source tree.
I don't think it's a good idea.
