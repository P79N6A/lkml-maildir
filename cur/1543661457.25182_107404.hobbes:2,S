How IA-32 centric would your prefered compiler choice be?  In other
words, if a small and fast C compiler turns up, which lacks support
for some currently ported to architectures, are you likely to
encourage kernel changes which will make it difficult for the other
architectures that have to stay with GCC to keep up?
John.
