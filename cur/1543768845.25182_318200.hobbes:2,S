Hi!
Okay, so the magic sequence seems to be:
# Take 2.6.12-rc3-mm3
#
# PCMCIA config:
# card "Cyber-blue Compact Flash Card"
#   manfid 0x0279, 0x950b
#   bind "serial_cs"
#
killall hciattach
sleep .1
setserial /dev/ttyS4 baud_base 921600
hciattach -s 921600 /dev/ttyS4 bcsp
hciconfig
hciconfig hci0 up
hciconfig
It took me a hour trying to debug weird stuff before I realized that I
need to do hciconfig up... to see some results...
