Well, my apologies, the behavior changed recently:
* S1 seems to work.
* S3 is so buggy: suspend still seem to complete. Pushing the power 
button to resume doesn't shutdown the machine anymore: the laptop wakes 
up but doesn't write or do anything. I'm only able to stop it by 
pressing the power button.
