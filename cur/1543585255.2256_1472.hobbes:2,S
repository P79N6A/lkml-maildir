Yes, since hdparm -t measures *SUSTAINED* transfers... the actual "head rate" of data reads from
disk surface.  Only if you read *only* data that is alread in harddrive's cache will you get a speed
close to the UDMA mode of the drive/controller.  The cache is around 1Mbyte, so for a split-second
re-read of some data....
