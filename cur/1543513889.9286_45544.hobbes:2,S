	How would the kernel know when you had accessed it 'once' without making
some odd assumptions about such things as block size?
	For example, to some people this might be considered accessing a file
"once":
	char buf[256];
	int f=open("myfile",O_RDONLY);
	while(read(f,buf,10)>0)
	{
	 // some junk
	}
	But unless the page size just happens to be 10, each page is going to be
read more than once. (Ouch!) So pages are still going to have to be cached,
otherwise each 'read' would result in a disk access.
	So, the question really is, exactly what do you _really_ want?
	DS
