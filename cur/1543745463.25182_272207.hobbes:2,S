Will do.

I can do that, doesn't per_cpu do cacheline alignment? I was trying to 
avoid allocating more space.

Well by spurious i mean that there will be a _lot_ of these events whilst 
the TCC attempts to reduce the processor temperature, i don't want to 
flood the mce log with the subsequent events.

The temperature drop can take a while, i've observed 2-3 minutes if the 
processor is also loaded and the ambient temperature is low (20C). So you 
could lose 12 or so slots in the mce log due to the temperature ping 
ponging.
