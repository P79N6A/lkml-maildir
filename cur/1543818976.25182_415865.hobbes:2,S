Some people want never ever to use swap. Systems that have no swap defined 
will currently not be able to migrate pages. Its kind of difficult to 
comprehend that you need to have swap for migration, but then its not 
going to be used.

The swapless thing is the most important for us because many of our 
customers do not have swap setup. Then follow the above 
features then the efficiency consideration.

VM_LOCKED semantics are that a page cannot be swapped out. Not being able 
to swap and not being able to migrate are the same right now. We need to 
separate both.
