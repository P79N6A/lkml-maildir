Are you referring to some means of mounting /proc so it appears
visible to ALL processes no matter where they're chroot'd to? If so,
I'd love to know how.
Sure, I know that the proc file system does not have to be mounted
over /proc (although it usually is), but I'd love to know how to mount
it so that it's visible to two processes that are respectively
chroot'd as follows:
 1. /home/ftp (aka ~ftp)
 2. /usr/mirrors (aka ~mirrors)
As you can see, there are no common subdirectories between those two
processes...
Best wishes from Riley.
