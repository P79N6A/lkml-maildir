In the first heat of hash races - creating 20,000 files in one directory
- dentry::hash lost out to my original hack::dx_hash, causing a high
percentage of leaf blocks to remain exactly half full and slowing down
the whole thing by about 5%.  (This was under uml - I haven't tried it
native yet but I expect the results to be similar.)
	  Contender			Result
	  =========			======
	dentry::hash		Average fullness = 2352 (57%)
	hack::dx_hash		Average fullness = 2758 (67%)
This suggests that dentry::hash is producing distinctly non-dispersed
results and needs to be subjected to further scrutiny.  I'll run the
next heat of hash races tomorrow, probably with R5, and CRC32 too if I
have time.
