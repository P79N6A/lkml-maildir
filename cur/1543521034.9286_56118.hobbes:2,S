After thinking about this more, I came to the conclusion that the
ZONE_BALANCED macro is just a quick way of checking whether we are
_really_ unbalanced. If so, then we need to see if we are really 
unbalanced, and do appropriate freeing. To determine whether a zone 
is _really_ unbalanced, I need to look at the number of free pages 
in the lower order zones too, then compare against the zone's water
marks. Ie, the "balancing" is not just about the absolute number of
free pages in the zone, but rather in the class that the zone 
represents.
I am waiting to see if Linus takes in my previous patch, before 
puting too much work into the balancing heuristics.

Yes, with all different types of machines out there, we need to be 
able to provide enough hooks to the arch code to tune the watermarks and
balancing frequency. Luckily, the zone structure is exposed via the
pg_data_t, so this should be no problem. Some sysctls are probably also 
called for.
