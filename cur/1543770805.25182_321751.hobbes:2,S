But if you do have to maintain your own driver it is a lot easier to start
from an existing and fix that one than it is to start all over. I bet the
modifcations aren't too big for many drivers anyways. When I get more time
I'll try to look into some drivers. Many of them is propably just about
removing printk's and the like.
