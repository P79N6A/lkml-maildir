Do you really believe that libscg is the only way in the world how to
access SCSI devices?
How can you be so sure that the abstraction you have chosen is the only
possible one?
If an answer to either of this questions is NO, why do you insist on
everybody bending their rules to suit your model?

That's really an interesting view ... if anybody is boycotting anybody,
then it's clearly you, because you refuse to extend libscg to support
the Linux model, although it's clearly possible.
				Have a nice fortnight
