So the size of the -rc patches is finally starting to shrink, but we still 
have way too many outstanding regression reports. Some of them should be 
already fixed in -rc5, but many won't be. So reporters, please do keep 
updating your entries as to whether they are fixed or not.
This time around, about 60% of the diffs are in arch code, but that's a 
bit misleading, because over half of that is actually just the defconfig 
files for SH. With the patch-queues shrinking, big trivial patches like 
that easily end up being inordinately noticeable just because there's a 
lot of lines there.
But apart from SH, the ia64 and SCSI updates do stand out. The rest is 
really pretty randomly spread out. I suspect the shortlog does as good a 
job as can be done (and is now small enough to be posted), but here's the 
dirstat anyway since I've given it for previous -rc releases.
	  15.1% arch/ia64/kernel/
	  18.3% arch/ia64/
	   2.3% arch/sh/boards/renesas/sh7710voipgw/
	   2.3% arch/sh/boards/renesas/
	   2.9% arch/sh/boards/
	  32.8% arch/sh/configs/
	  37.6% arch/sh/
	  59.3% arch/
	   7.7% drivers/scsi/aic94xx/
	   2.0% drivers/scsi/libsas/
	  17.1% drivers/scsi/
	  21.3% drivers/
	   2.4% fs/
	   2.9% include/linux/
	   3.9% include/
	   2.7% kernel/
	   4.4% security/selinux/
	   5.7% security/
I'd like developers and testers alike to take a good look at the 
regression email that Rafael sends out, and please help him keep the 
entries up-to-date.
