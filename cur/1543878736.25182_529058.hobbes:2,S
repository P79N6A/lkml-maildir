As you pointed out, this patch has no effect if nr_requests is too large,
because it distinguishes heavy disks depending on the length of the write-
requests queue of each disk.
This patch is for providing the system administrators with room to avoid
the problem by adjusting parameters appropriately, rather than an automatic
solution for any possible situations.
Could you please tell me some situations in which we should set nr_request
that large?
Thanks,
