So, using the above for libraries I found 3 libraries on the system, that
use cmov:
libldap.so.2.0.15
libcrypto.so.0.9.6
libqt-mt.so.3.0.5
So, the libraries have nothing to do with the kernel, the Debian guys
might take a notice of them (not glibc, but still...). But what I do find
interesting and noteworthy - is that this problem is specific only to some
revisions of this CPU, which might be of interest to all.
Thanks for the tip with the script!
