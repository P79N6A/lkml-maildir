it's easy to check wether it's a problem wrt. shared/unshared IRQs. Please
could you boot with 'maxcpus=1' LILO command line option - this will get a
single-processor SMP kernel, with the IRQ sharing properties the mptable
dictates. Basically if any IRQ sharing makes a stability difference that
is very likely not a generic SMP bug but a driver one.
