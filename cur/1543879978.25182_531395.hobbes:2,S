Actually, it wasn't.
We *did* reach a consensus that isdn4linux is not obsolete in the
accepted sense of the word, because there is no replacement for it
so far.
OTOH I have since submitted (twice, in fact) a patch that would remove
the "(obsolete)" label from the Kconfig entry, but somehow nothing
ever became of it. My submissions just linger in LKML, uncommented and
unmerged.
To sum it up, we agree that the "(obsolete)" label is wrong, but we
won't remove it. I have no idea how to resolve that situation.
What I do know is that it would be very wrong to remove isdn4linux,
because it has an existing userbase with nowhere else to go.
