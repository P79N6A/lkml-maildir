DEFINE_PER_CPU(int, zone_flag);
	get_cpu();	// likely already true and then not needed
	__get_cpu(zone_flag) = 1;
	/* wmb is implied in spin_lock I think */
	spin_lock(&zone->lru_lock);
	...
	spin_unlock(&zone->lru_lock);
	__get_cpu(zone_flag) = 0;
	put_cpu();
Interrupt handler
	if (!__get_cpu(zone_flag)) {
		do things with zone locks 
	}
The interrupt handler shouldn't touch zone_flag. If it wants
to it would need to be converted to a local_t and incremented/decremented
(should be about the same cost at least on architectures with sane
local_t implementation)
