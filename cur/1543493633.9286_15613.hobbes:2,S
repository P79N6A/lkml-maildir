Bad idea, there are a load of user-space libraries for this purpose -
for example ESD, OSS, ALSA and so forth. 
There's no real need to include sound with the libc library, that's not
its function; its function is to provide us with a safe interface to the
kernel's syscalls that's POSIX compliant.
Perhaps the POSIX boys might like to define standards for a multimedia
library for UNIX use though - that at least, WOULD guarantee that code and
multimedia stuff will be able to work on different platforms (i.e *BSD,
Linux, Solaris & BeOS).
Something like libmedia.[so|a] and corresponding includes.
