what do you mean by "PCI Bursting" ?? are you using DMA (PCI card Mem 
Write Multiple) or MMIO read (CPU Mem Read Line) ?
anyway on my system, 2 CPU Xeon 2.6GHz GC-LE + a custom PCI-X 100MHz 
card, I get
- 440.755 MByte/s, only 1 process
- 424.683 MByte/s, the process below running:
sh -c 'while true ; do echo miao ; done' > /dev/null
it's:
Linux xeino 2.4.22-1.2199.nptlsmp #1 SMP Wed Aug 4 11:48:29 EDT 2004 
i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
what is your kernel version?
