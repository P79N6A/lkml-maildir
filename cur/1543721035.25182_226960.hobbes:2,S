Ok, well perhaps what I actually need are some extra callbacks for
security modules then.  A token-group (I'm changing the term because
PAG is confused with an older patch) needs to have an access spec
indicating who can read/modify the token-group as a whole and who
can read/modify each token within it.  In my emails with Andy
Lutomirski we have thought about the idea of putting the token-groups
in /proc and running all access through that way.  If we do that, then 
it
would be very practical to just use file permissions and POSIX ACLs
to control access, in which case each token-group and token could
just use the same access-control mechanisms that are used for other
files in /proc.  That would likely be the easiest path

Ok, well thanks for pointing out linux/security.h anyway.
Thanks very much for your help!
