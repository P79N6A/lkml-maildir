Probably you understood me perfectly well, but just to be sure:
# ls -l /dev/hde12
brw-rw----   1 root     disk      33,  12 Nov  8 20:48 /dev/hde12
Aha. Users are confronted with 12 (in the name: hde12) and 33,12
(in the ls output). Also the kernel itself (in the boot messages)
will call this partition hde12.
So, if there is some need to print major and minor somewhere,
a decimal version is to be preferred over a hexadecimal version.
