	I've been having some rather aggrevating problems w/ IDE on my
dual PPro system under 2.3.41 (also had trouble w/ 2.3.39 and 2.3.40,
though have yet to try anything prior).  The problem is somewhat simple,
the machine boots, and then stops after detecting the IDE controllers,
but before actually finding the disks.  The kernel appears to just stop.
	Under the exact same setup I've had no problems w/ 2.2.12-2.2.14.
	Any initial thoughts?  I'm more than happy to provide whatever
information is neccessary, perhaps individually to someone instead of
spamming the list, unless people feel it would be more useful to spam
the list...
	Any feedback would be appriciated. :)
