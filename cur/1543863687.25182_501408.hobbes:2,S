No, it's in my tree, and in -mm.  It's all in one patch at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-01-driver/network-device.patch
if you want to try it out.
Or you can try it with any of the subsystems that have already been
converted over to use the struct device code, like misc, mem, and many
others.  Just look for the symlinks in /sys/class/CLASS_NAME/ instead of
real subdirectories.
So I'd really prefer to not apply this patch, and just do this kind of
work for 'struct device' instead.
The first one looks fine, I'll add it to my queue.
thanks,
greg k-h
