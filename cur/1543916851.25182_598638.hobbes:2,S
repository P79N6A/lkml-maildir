You'll have to contact Digital Logic and have them check with the BIOS vendor
to see if the fix was made in that version or not.  I don't have that
particular board, so I can't try out the fixes here.
I'm still trying to track down the particulars of the fix from the BIOS 
vendor.  I'll let you know.

Sure - you might as well - just to make sure its the same problem.
