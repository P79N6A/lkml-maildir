Subject: VM question - accounting of SysV SHM

Sorry to ask this question on the list but I've Googled and found nothing.
Is system V shared memory accounted for as Cached, or as normal
application memory?
I have an application that uses SysV shared memory and O_DIRECT for
all IO, but when it starts up, the cached column in vmstat seems to go
up by the amount of shared memory allocated.
