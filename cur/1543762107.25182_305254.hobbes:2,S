I haven't tested it with 2.6.11 yet... real life showed up, and hasn't gone 
away yet. *stab!* I'll be testing it right after I send this email.
With joystick_port=1 there are no messages from the module, I've tried a bunch 
of specific ports, and it doesn't work. The ports are not reserved 
in /proc/ioports. /sys/bus/gameport/devices is empty.
