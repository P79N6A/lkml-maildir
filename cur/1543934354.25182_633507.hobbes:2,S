Probably time, yes.  ISTR the main open issues are on host side
behavior, and it'll be easier to sort those out if musb_hdrc can
be updated without a few months intervening lag time.
Plus that'll make it easier to merge the Blackfin platform updates
for that driver.  It's fine that musb_hdrc works on N800, N810,
DaVinci, OMAP2430, and more ... but non-TI chips also integrate
that high speed OTG silicon.  :)
