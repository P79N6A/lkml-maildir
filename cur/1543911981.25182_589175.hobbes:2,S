No, each of these sites needs careful attention.
- Can we reduce the amount of memory which is being used?  Because
  hweight(num_possible_cpus) <= hweight(NR_CPUS)
- Do we _really_ need to be iterating across all possible CPUS?  Or
  should we really have been using for_each_online_cpu() or
  for_each_present_cpu()?
See, many of these sites will be old code which predates cpu hotplug and
the more advanced cpu masks.  We shouldn't just blindly go and pretend that
these sites have been modernised when they haven't.
Right now, pretty much every instance of NR_CPUS in the tree is a flag
which says "old, krufty, fixme".   Let's not hide that please.
