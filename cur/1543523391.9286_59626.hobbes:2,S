Agreed, definitely.

Also agreed --- removing the per-process flag will just penalise _all_
processes when we enter thrashing.

Actually, that probably isn't too bad, as long as we make sure we wake
up kswapd on GFP_ATOMIC allocations when the free page count gets below
freepages.min, even if the allocation succeeded (and Rik's patch does
do that).
