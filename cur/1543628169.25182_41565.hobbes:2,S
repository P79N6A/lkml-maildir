Note: I did in no way try to blame Andi on this: quite the reverse. I'm 
saying that this was how it worked back before BK too - the bulk of the 
patches literally come to me as "private" patches, and they aren't cc'd to 
linux-kernel.
(Side note: that doesn't mean that they haven't had comments on the 
mailing lists, or that earlier versions or at least parts of them haven't 
been sent on the kernel list).

Absolutely - as you noticed I accepted the patch, even though there was a 
clash (with a released kernel) in there.

This is why I think it might be a good reason to just have a daily script: 
not just to create the patches, but also to kind of keep a running 
commentary on the kernel list on what I've merged..
