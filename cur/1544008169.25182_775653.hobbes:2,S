Hmm. This means that something set the alignment flags incorrectly. The 
resource _should_ have IORESOURCE_SIZEALIGN set for a resource with size 
alignment, and IORESOURCE_STARTALIGN for one that has start alignment.
Your patch doesn't fix anything, it just hides the bug.
It would be good to hear what resource this is, and where it got set. So 
instead of that broken patch that just hides the problem, please try to 
debug it with something like
	resource_size_t expected_align;
	expected_align = (i < PCI_BRIDGE_RESOURCES) ? r_size : r->start;
	align = resource_alignment(r);
	if (align != expected_align) {
		dev_warn(&dev->dev,
			"BAR %d %llx-%llx wrong alignment flags %lx %llx (%llx)\n",
			i,
			(unsigned long long) r->start,
			(unsigned long long) r->end,
			r->flags,
			(unsigned long long) align,
			(unsigned long long) expected_align);
		/* Hacky and wrong, but trying to keep things 
		align = expected_align;
	}
or something like that. And then we just need to figure out which setup 
routine sets the wrong alignment flag,.
