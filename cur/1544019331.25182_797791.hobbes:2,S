Sure, new patch, extra commentary removed.  Also brought the panic/printk text
into agreement.
FIPS 140-2 specifies that all access to various cryptographic modules be
prevented in the event that any of the provided self tests fail on the various
implemented algorithms.  We already panic when any of the test in testmgr.c
fail when we are operating in fips mode.  The continuous test in the cprng here
was missed when that was implmented.  This code simply checks for the
fips_enabled flag if the test fails, and warns us via syslog or panics the box
accordingly.
