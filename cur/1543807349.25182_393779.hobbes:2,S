Hi,
The fact that '-' is replaced by '_' in module names seems
to be a feature not a bug. So, what was the rationale for this?
A drawback is that it becomes not trivial to map module
names to filenames as this does not work:
for FILE in $(cut -d' ' -f1 < /proc/modules); do
    ls /lib/modules/MY_NEW_KERNEL/kernel/**/$FILE.ko
done
If it is some kind of user-friendliness, then why not make
the module name matching case insensitive ?  :-p
Sorry for the ranting tone, but I am quite confused.
Thanks.
