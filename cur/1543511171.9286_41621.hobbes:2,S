Hi,
I'm watching your current mailthread, and i'd like to give some info i got
myself today.
I've used the 2.2.12 kernel, patched with the IDE patch for kernel 2.2.10
(the patch for kernel 2.2.12 didn't work for my setup, ide3 channel was
not detected, with the 2.2.10 patch it did work), and the modified ide.c
file what was suggested earlier on by one of you guys.
My system setup is an Abit BP6 SMP board with 2x Celeron 366. The board
has an Intel BX chipset with an additional HPT366 UDMA/66 controller.
4 Quantum Bigfoots 19.2GB's are installed on hda, hdc, hde and hdg.
The mkfs.ext2 /dev/md0 runs till the end, when it's writing superblocks
etc, i get a kernel panic. I did this all twice, twice a kernel panic.
Hope this info is some sort of help
Regards,
Martijn
