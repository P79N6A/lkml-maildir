vmx (and svm) allow us to add an offset to the physical tsc.  We set it
on startup to -tsc (so that an rdtsc on boot would return 0), and
massage it on vcpu migration so that guest rdtsc is monotonic.
The net effect is that tsc on a vcpu can experience large forward jumps
and changes in rate, but no negative jumps.
