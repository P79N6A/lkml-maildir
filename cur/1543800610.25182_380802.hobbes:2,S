Not really. maxbatch limits the number of RCU callbacks in a
batch inside RCU subsystem, it doesn't assure that total number
of RCU callbacks invoked in that instance of softirq would
be maxbatch. The idea was to give the control back to softirq
subsystem after maxbatch RCUs are processed and let the softirq
latency logic take over.

It was intentional. I wanted to keep the RCU throttling separate
and let softirq handling do its own thing. Softirqs, once delegated
to ksoftirqd were managable from the latency perspective, but
not a very long RCU batch.
I do agree that the two layers of batching really makes things
subtle. I think the best we can do is to figure out some way of
automatic throttling in RCU and forced quiescent state under extreme
conditions. That way we will have less dependency on softirq
throttling.
Thanks
