 Now, while I truly believe that the situation with 2.6 is much better
than 2.4, we should not forget that  a lot of people would not call any
2.4.X stable, with X<18 (that number may vary :-).
 Some more "conservative" outfits will use some 2.4.X for quite a long
time. Even on new hardware. Continuity, you know. Maybe stupid, maybe
annoying, but is a fact of life.
