No. This is wrong.
"=m" means that the new value of the memory location is *set*.
Which means that gcc will potentially optimize away any previous stores to 
that memory location.
And yes, it happens, and yes, we've seen it.
The gcc docs are secondary. They're not updated, they aren't correct, they 
don't reflect reality, and they don't matter. The only correct thing to 
use is "+m" for things like this, or alternatively to just use the 
"memory" specifier at the end and make gcc generate really crappy code.
