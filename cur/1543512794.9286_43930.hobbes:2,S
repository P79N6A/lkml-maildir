Debian has that too. On my potato system I have:
% dpkg -l | grep curs
ii  libncurses4     4.2-3.2        Shared libraries for terminal handling
ii  libncurses4-dev 4.2-3.2        Developer's libraries and docs for ncurses
ii  ncurses-base    4.2-3.2        Descriptions of common terminal types
ii  ncurses-bin     4.2-3.2        Terminal-related programs and man pages
ii  ncurses-term    4.2-3.2        Additional terminal type definitions
Look like you have to install libncurses4-dev.
Mike.
