Hi, this is the latest set of gfs patches, it includes some minor munging
since the previous set.  Andrew, could this be added to -mm? there's not
much in the way of pending changes.

I'd like to get a list of specific things remaining for merging.  I
believe we've responded to everything from earlier reviews, they were very
helpful and more would be excellent.  The list begins with one item from
before that's still pending:
- Adapt the vfs so gfs (and other cfs's) don't need to walk vma lists.
  [cf. ops_file.c:walk_vm(), gfs works fine as is, but some don't like it.]
...
Thanks
Dave
