This should use libblkid to do the scanning of the devices, and it can
cache the results for efficiency.  Best would be to have the same LABEL+UUID
for all devices in the same filesystem, and then once any of these devices
are found the mount.btrfs code can query the rest of the devices to find
the remaining parts of the filesystem.
