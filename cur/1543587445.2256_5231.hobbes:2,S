Okay but what will be used for a base for hardware that has critical
timing issues due to the rules of the hardware?
I do not care but your drives/floppy/tapes/cdroms/cdrws do:
/*
 * Timeouts for various operations:
 */
#define WAIT_DRQ        (5*HZ/100)      /* 50msec - spec allows up to 20ms */
#ifdef CONFIG_APM
#define WAIT_READY      (5*HZ)          /* 5sec - some laptops are very slow */
#else
#define WAIT_READY      (3*HZ/100)      /* 30msec - should be instantaneous */
#endif /* CONFIG_APM */
#define WAIT_PIDENTIFY  (10*HZ) /* 10sec  - should be less than 3ms (?), if all ATAPI CD is closed at boot */
#define WAIT_WORSTCASE  (30*HZ) /* 30sec  - worst case when spinning up */
#define WAIT_CMD        (10*HZ) /* 10sec  - maximum wait for an IRQ to happen */
#define WAIT_MIN_SLEEP  (2*HZ/100)      /* 20msec - minimum sleep time */
Give me something for HZ or a rule for getting a known base so I can have
your storage work and not corrupt.
