   I think the tunnel drivers should return the name of the
   device the tunnel add created. Currently the tunnel_lookup
   functions copy the name into the stack var in the ioctl
   function but the ioctl copies the parm from the tunnel
   device.
Hmmm, net/ipv6/sit.c already has the version you propose. :-)))
Which one is correct?
Alexey, what do you think?
Franks a lot,
