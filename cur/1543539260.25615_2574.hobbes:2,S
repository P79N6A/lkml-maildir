Sadly, AFAIK nobody is doing e2compr port to 2.3/2.4. The 2.2 e2compr is        
very stable and very usable (that's at least my experience.) There was a        
race that showed up when using samba, but that also fixed now (thanks to        
Peter Moulder).                                                                 
The e2compr support in e2fsprogs is still a separate patch, available at        
the same place as the e2compr kernel patch.

The file is compressed right after you do 'chattr -c file'. It then             
remains compressed until you do 'chattr -c file' - even when you modify         
the file.                                                                       
You can also chattr +c a dir, and all the files created into the dir will       
then be compressed.
