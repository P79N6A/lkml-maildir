I searched in linux kernel 2.6.10, didn't find it, then I tried
2.6.20, it is there. But I am not familiar with assembly language, so
can anybody kindly explain it, I don't know the difference between
KPROBE_ENTRY and ENTRY, however, I can find both of these items in
some files, such as arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S.
Thank you.
Regards
Jason Xiao
