I need ACPI. That said, USB works fine for all other devices. I am
using a Bluetooth dongle, a smart media reader, a Palm cradle, and
my mouse is also USB...
When I unplug the device, everything works fine. Plus, I did get the
device to work previously and have not changed anything since then
other than a reboot.
The device is, btw, an internal Maxxtro smart media reader,
connected to the motherboard directly by with four pins, i.e. not
a USB jack.
And yes, VIA sucks.
