Not from me, sorry. I really don't have the time, or the drive, to do it
right now.  thinkpad-acpi is taking all my "kernel code" time, which is not
much.

Because you cannot risk anyone changing one of them behind your back while
you are trying to set them all before you lock them.  And I am not even
considering an attack scenario, I am considering two apps trying to set it
up concurrently.
You need some sort of locking for this sort of device, and exclusive open +
ioctl solves the problem completely.  Sysfs is not made for this kind of
thing.
