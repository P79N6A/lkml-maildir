Maybe it's possible to have a normal VM policy in cases where such a brain-dead
allocation is not requested and revert to something sub-sub-optimal in
case where the user decided to go for such windows-able hardware.

Given the time that can be spent in TLB reloading with some applications,
many Unixes on RISC machines nowadays try to lump virtually-contiguous
pages into physically-contiguous pages and then use bigger-pages for those
blocks (on architectures that allow a finer choice than the x86's 4KB or 4MB).
So it seems that some notion of blocks-of-pages might be useful.
