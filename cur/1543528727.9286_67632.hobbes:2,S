If allowing mount on open directory is correct, readdir and lookup on
mountpoint should have consistency. As I had pointed out:
#cp /etc/passwd /mnt3/a
#cd /mnt3
#mount -t ext2 /dev/sda6 /mnt3
#ls                       >>> readdir on mounted dir
lost+found
#ls -l                   >>> readdir on mounted dir followed by lookup in
                           original directory
ls: lost+found: No such file or directory
total 0
#cat a                  >>> lookup in original directory
root:x:0:0....
