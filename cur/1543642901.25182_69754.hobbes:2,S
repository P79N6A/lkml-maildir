Interesting.  At that point we are just reading sectors from disk
using normal IO path.  Had already done two reads and still have
at least one more to do.  Results of parsing are stored in temporary
array and partitioning information is yet to be changed - we hadn't
even started updating it (that would happen after parsing is over).
Basically, the shit hits the fan in the middle of work that is identical
in 2.5.34 and 2.5.33...

Detection happens in the same order.  Attaching to subdrivers doesn't,
but that's not a problem...
