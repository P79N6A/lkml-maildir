Larry has said he will do the work you want if you pay him. This is
not lack of freedom it is lack of cash. So if you really believe in
this cough up the dough for Larry, and then only if he refuses to do
the work after being paid do you have valid reasons to complain.  This
is not an argument about freedom, it's trying to get someone else to
do work for you for free. Start a PayPal account and get all of the
unhappy people to contribute. I'll chip in $10 just so that I don't
have to read these rants anymore.
