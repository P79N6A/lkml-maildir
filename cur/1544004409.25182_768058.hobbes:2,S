Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Make nmi_shootdown_cpus() usable by non-kdump code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi, Ingo,
As tip/master is a moving target, I am splitting the previous kdump/reboot
virtualization-disable code series[1] into smaller series so the simpler
parts can be included sooner. This first series is just for making
nmi_shootdown_cpus() usable by non-kdump code, by moving their generic
parts to reboot.c.
They are exactly the same patches I've sent as 01-08 in the previous
series.
The NMI IPIs method used by nmi_shootdown_cpus() is the only way
we can make sure VMX is disabled on all CPUs before rebooting, on
emergency_restart(), because CPUs may have IRQs disabled. That's why I
will reuse nmi_shootdown_cpus() for the emergency_restart code when
VMX is enabled.
The virtualization-specific parts should come soon, after I implement
the suggestions by Eric and Avi, by making the virtualization-disabling
functions inline so they can be used directly by the core code (instead
of using the function pointer tricks from my previous series).
