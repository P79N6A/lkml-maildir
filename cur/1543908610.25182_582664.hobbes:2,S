Last night I built the 2.6.23-rc2-git4 kernel but could not get it to
boot.  I rebuilt it this morning from scratch on the chance that I made
a finger-check the first time through and screwed the pooch.
After the second attempt to build this i still could not boot the
system.  I received the following messages (hand copied - not sure how
to capture messages during the early phases of a boot)
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 000:00:04.0
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 4 of device 000:00:06.0
Loading, please wait
ehci_hcd 0000:00:02.1 init 0000:00:02.1 fail, -16
ohci_hcd 0000:00:02.0 init 0000:00:02.0 fail, -16
The system cranks for a while and then I see the messages:
hdb: <4>hdb: dma_timer_expiry: DMA status = oFF
and thereafter 
hdb: dma_timer_expiry: DMA status = oFF
is issued every 10 seconds.
The hdb drive is where the system (root partition) is located
My basic configuration looks like:
* AMD_64 X2 4600+ (older 939 pin unit)
* MSI K8n NEO 4 motherboard 
* 2 gig memory across 4 512 modules
* hda: IDE-DVD ROM 16x, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
* hdb: WDC WD2500JB-55REA0, ATA DISK drive
* hdc: WDC WD2000BB-22GUC0, ATA DISK drive
* hdd: Maxtor 6Y120P0, ATA DISK drive
* ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xf884a480 ctl 0xf884a4a0 bmdma 0x0001cc00
irq 19
* ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xf884a580 ctl 0xf884a5a0 bmdma 0x0001cc08
irq 19
* Nvidia GeForce 7600 GS Video Card
* Nvidia CK804 chip set
All hard drives formatted EXT3
Using generic "nv" video driver (NOT Nvidia's driver)
System boots and runs good on 2.6.23-rc1 through 2.6.23-rc2-git3
The base system I am using is Ubuntu's 7.04 with minor modifications
I hope that this provides enough information to start with.  If I have
left anything important out please let me know what you would llike to
see (and maybe where to get it)
