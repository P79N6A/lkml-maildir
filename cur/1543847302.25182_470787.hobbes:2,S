That is, the standard model is useless?  I think you've made
a few strange leaps of logic there ... care to fill in those
gaps and explain just _why_ that standard model is "useless"???
Recall by the way that the autosuspend stuff kicked off with
discussions about exactly how to make sure that Linux could
get the power savings inherent in suspending USB root hubs,
with remote wakeup enabling use of the mouse on that keyboard.
(I remember Len Brown talking to me a few years back about how
that was the "last" 2W per controller easily available to save
power on Centrino laptops ... now we're almost ready to claim
that savings.)

Sure it is.  Nobody had to write that code.  Of course, Pavel was
skipping some details too ... "laptop_mode" kicks some other system
controls so that the disk drive isn't accessed so much.

Yes, and many of us use the much lighter weight kernel based control
models by preference.   Why waste hundreds of Kbytes of userspace for
a daemon when a few hundred bytes of kernel code can implement a
better and more reactive kernel policy for cpufreq?

Plus lots of advantages, including the not-to-be-underrated simplicity.

In which case the /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup flag can be
marked as disabled.  No wakeup ... but of course, no power
savings either.  (One can still unplug the mouse...)

Unrelated to USB or any other specific subsystem; the system
suspends by "echo mem > /sys/power/state" regardless.  (That is,
once the bugs in ACPI, and sometimes drivers, get fixed.)

The reasons X11 becomes unresponsive have very little to do with USB
or autosuspend; happens all the time with PS2 mice, trackpads, etc.
Again, those issues are unrelated to USB, or to the API you said you
wanted to see.
