Hi,
just installed 2.6.11.11 on a single board computer using
a SGS Thomson integrated USB controller and found that
inserting a USB 2.0 stick generated a "IRQ INTR_SF lossage"
message and further lockup of the driver. Ie. a cat of 
/proc/bus/usb/devices will freeze the cat process.
Using a USB 1.1 stick works fine.
At the moment I don't have any logs to send you as the device
is not connected to anything.
One thing to consider is that the 2.0 stick was formatted without
a partition table and the 1.1 had partitions.
I don't mind being unable to use the 2.0 stick, but the freezing of the
driver shouldn't happen. Now a reboot is needed after a 2.0 stick has
been inserted to clear the situation.
Please tell me what logs you need and I will try to provide them to you.
Best from Finland
Dag
