Oh, I know why errno is stupid and normally my reaction would be the
same.  However, in this case I would prefer to add
static int errno;
to do_mounts.c and be done with that.  Reasons:
a) eventually it's going to userland, at which point the issue becomes moot
(we won't share memory with anybody and don't do signal handlers).
b) within this file we have at most two threads of execution (do_linuxrc()
and the rest).  mount_root() is called only while do_linuxrc() is either
not started yet or had already exited.  IOW, even in kernel it's safe.
c) when it's in userland we will be really better off with _syscall5 for
mount() - we can rewrite it by hands to return the value in sane manner,
but that means bringing a _lot_ of arch-specific inline assmebler into
the file.  Which we might have to do anyway, OTOH...
Dunno.  At this stage I'd prefer the patch I've posted + static int errno;
in do_mounts.c.  Alternatively, we can replace mount() with sys_mount() in
that place (everything else simply doesn't give a damn for errno) and deal
with that when we move code to userland.
