But most of the time, all of these tracing/* topics are quickly merged
into tip/master.
Sometimes they are not because of a pending breakage but tip/master is
rarely more than a tiny bit out of sync against
tracing/ topics.
I guess tip/master is enough and good to base a work on, or to see the
latest changes in tracing.
No?
