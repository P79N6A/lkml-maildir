I have tried 2.2.16 also... redhat's kernel on their bootdisk does the
same also so I figured I would try the development ones but no luck with
any

The bios on this machine is horrid.... they appearently thought that it
would be cute to make it look kinda like windows but also it is basically
just information on the system... almost nothing edit-able besides which
device order to boot from and power saving.

oh what fun... I would assume that the onboard sound and ethernet are
taking some RAM away... yet with these disabled I dont get anywhere either
