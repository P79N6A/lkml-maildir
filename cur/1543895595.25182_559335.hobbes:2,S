http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.21.y.git;a=summary
While linux-2.6.21.y is moving forward, it would appear that
linux-2.6-stable is back several releases?
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6-stable.git;a=summary
shows 2.6.21.1 as the last 2.6.21.Y release. Is that intentional?
Thanks,
