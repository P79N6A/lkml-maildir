This option _is_ useful because it allows allows a user to build an
av7110 driver without hotplug etc. I NAK any attempt to remove it.
Sorry, a kernel option cannot cause a legal issue. Only the user does.
For non-distribution kernels there is no difference whether firmware is
loaded at run-time or compiled-in.
Obviously, there might be a difference for distribution kernels if you
are not allowed to distribute the firmware (imho not a problem in this
case, but IANAL). Simple solution: Do not enable the option.
I have no problem if you want to remove STANDALONE: Simply remove the
dependency to STANDALONE, but keep DVB_AV7110_FIRMWARE with default 'n'.
