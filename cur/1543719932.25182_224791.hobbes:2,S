It just freezes, I then use console=ttyS1 simply to capture the 
messages. SYSRQ does nothing and the only way out is to press the reset 
switch. I shall try 2.6.7-rc2-mm2 later with different and with no 
commandline options if it also freezes.
I start with the same basic .config for all kernels (make oldconfig)  
and grub is setup as below, 2.6.7-rc2-mm1 freezes and 2.6.7-rc2 is fine, 
2.6.7-rc1-mm1 froze, 2.6.7-rc1 was fine.
title 2.6.7-rc2-mm1
    kernel (hd0,0)/boot/2.6.7-rc2-mm1 root=/dev/hda1 vga=0x31a 
splash=silent desktop hdb=ide-cd showopts
title 2.6.7-rc2
    kernel (hd0,0)/boot/2.6.7-rc2 root=/dev/hda1 vga=0x31a splash=silent 
desktop hdb=ide-cd showopts
