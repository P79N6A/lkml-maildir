I'm experiencing something very strange.
If I dialin to my ISP with ISDN (Linux-2.2.1, teles card, sync PPP) and
I telnet to one of the machines in the ISP network with a 2.2.1 kernel
I get weird hangs. For example, "ls" outputs 4 lines, hangs 1 second,
outputs 5 or 6 lines, hangs one second, then completes.
If I telnet to a machine with a 2.0.36 kernel I do not have that problem
at all. This is 100% repeatable.
So I've tried various things. For example, regular PPP doesn't have
this problem, only ISDN.
Now I've found out that if I turn off VJ header compression, the
problem is gone.
So it's probably a VJ bug in the ISDN ppp driver, but it's most weird
that it only shows up talking to a 2.2.1 kernel and not when talking
to a 2.0.36 kernel.
Is this a known problem (any isdn4linux guys around here?)
Mike.
