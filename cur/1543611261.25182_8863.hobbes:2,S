There are still cases where it's just about OK to use sleep_on(). If you
_and_ your waker will hold the BKL, or if you call it with IRQs disabled and
are woken from an ISR, which is horrible but does currently work. Also if
you just don't _care_ if you miss a wakeup sometimes.
ISTR much filesystem code falls into the former category at the moment.
We _should_ remove sleep_on and friends, but let's start with this patch, 
which allows us to clean up the filesystem code later...
Note that I haven't put the check in the _timeout versions. Maybe we should.
