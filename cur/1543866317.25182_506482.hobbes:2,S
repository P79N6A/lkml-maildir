Just did a pull for the first time since 2.6.20, and a /megaton/ of new 
warnings have appeared, on Fedora Core 6/x86-64 "make allyesconfig".
All of the new warnings spew appear to be "pointers differ in 
signedness" warning.  Granted, we should care about these, but even a 
"silent" build (make -s) now spews far more output than any human could 
possibly care about, and digging important nuggets out of all this noise 
is beginning to require automated tools rather than just human eyes.
