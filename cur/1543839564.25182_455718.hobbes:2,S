I was not aware that this had been discussed before.  Bernhard (in the
old LKML posting above) seems to imply that having kernel_thread()
itself not fail on ptrace would be a sufficient fix, which I don't agree
with.  There may be other reasons for kernel_thread() to fail, such as
the kernel running out of resources; with OpenVZ, kernel_thread() is not
allowed from within VEs.

I'm afraid that this does not properly clean things up on error.  I just
had a look at linux-2.6.17.9/drivers/block/loop.c - it still uses
kernel_thread() and has the same "goto out_putf" on error return from
kernel_thread(), which appears to not clean things up.
