I observe a couple more problems with 2.3.33.  I have SCSI hard disk
and SCSI CDROM on an oldish ncr53c810, dual pentium system;
these are two things that never happened with 2.0.x or 2.2.x:
1. I have a CD player "wmsvencd" always running in the window maker dock.
When a data CD is mounted, wmsvencd goes to 'D' state, like this:
root@pccross:/usr/lib/news/acct/# ps lp 18317
 FLAGS   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   SIZE   RSS WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND
     0  1431 18317 18302   0   0   2332  1012 scsi_alloca D   ?   0:03 /usr/loca
Data from the CD is normally accessible.  After some time (several hours?)
the process goes away.
2. Updatedb at night produced this output:
find: /u/var/spool/news/alt/fan/tolkien/123435: Input/output error
find: /u/var/spool/news/alt/fan/tolkien/123435: Input/output error
find: /u/var/spool/news/rec/games/frp/dnd/402139: Input/output error
find: /u/var/spool/news/rec/games/frp/dnd/402139: Input/output error
find: /u/var/spool/news/rec/skydiving/184838: Input/output error
find: /u/var/spool/news/rec/skydiving/184838: Input/output error
there are no hints of disk errors in the syslog; attempt to access these
files immediately produce error result (no noticable attempt to read the
disk):
root@pccross:/usr/lib/news/acct/# ls /u/var/spool/news/alt/fan/tolkien/123435
ls: /u/var/spool/news/alt/fan/tolkien/123435: Input/output error
root@pccross:/usr/lib/news/acct/# less /u/var/spool/news/alt/fan/tolkien/123435
/u/var/spool/news/alt/fan/tolkien/123435: I/O error
