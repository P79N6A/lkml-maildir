Subject: [PATCH] fix pktcdvd breakage from commit e105b8bfc769b0545b6f0f395179d1e43cbee822
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/30/38

	device_create() will create a symlink in /sys/dev/char unless
the class has ->dev_kobj cleared; pktcdvd uses it to populate the
/sys/class/pktcdvd/ with per-device subdirectories.  While we do
want /sys/class/pktcdvd/pktcdvd[0-7]/dev to contain a device number,
we definitely do not want it to try and crap into /sys/dev/char; if
nothing else, device number is *block* one (and we don't want it
to crap into /sys/dev/block either - there such symlinks will be created
by add_disk() and they will point to /sys/block/pktcdvd[0-7]).
	As it is, attempt to set the damn thing up will end up with
sysfs_add_one() barfing at duplicate entries and /sys/class/pktcdvd/pktcdvd*/*/
not created at all.  The fix is trivial: clear ->dev_kobj in the class to
tell device_add() that no, we do *not* want these symlinks, TYVM...
	FWIW, all traces containing pkt_setup_dev() on kerneloops.org appear
to be from that one.  It had been around since 2.6.26; probably -stable
fodder...
