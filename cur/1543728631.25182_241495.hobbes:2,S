I have found that around 1400 KB is a magic number on my system, this
triggers the preempt violation/xrun about 50% of the time.  1300 never
triggers it, 1500 always triggers it.
Also the amount of memory being mlockall'ed does not affect the length
of the preemption violation - if we hit it at all, there's a 10ms
latency, whether we lock 1400KB or 100MB.
Hopefully O6 will give enough info to track this down.
