Correct.  The low-latency patch does some other work to try to break up
huge routines, too.

I suspect you will find a lower average latency with the preemption
patch.  However, I suspect with the low-latency patch you may see a
lower maximum since it works on some of the terribly long-held lock
situations.
In truth, a combination of the two could prove useful.  I have been
working on finding the worst-case non-preemption regions (longest held
lock regions) in the kernel.

I hope :)

Andrew's patch should work fine on all platforms, although I think the
configure statement is in the processor section so you will need to move
it to arch/alpha/config.in
The preemption patch has a small amount of arch-independent code but we
are working on supporting all architectures.  2.5...
