For the record, I don't and have not done ports.
Rather I was interested in introducing a scaled math header.  It would 
contain routines to allow access to the 64 bit mpy and div 
instructions, which ,of course, can be done in C but, if you don't 
want the 64-bit lib, must be done with a rather large bit of code to 
do simple s32=s64/s32 and s32=s64%s32 calculations.  And, on 64-bit 
archs the whole problem goes away.

I understand what you think, but don't understand why you think that :(
