With what? EMACS is an optional thing. troff is not lightweight too, but
it doesn't come anywhere to the EMACS ballpark.

Except conversion to plain text requires TeX, IIRC, and that's Not
Good(tm). To start with, TeX *is* heavier than troff. Personally I have it
around, but not everyone does. And keeping all manual pre-compiled is not
too nice - eats space.
The only reason for info vs. man is that there are documents too large for
manpages. BSD keeps that stuff (written in troff) in the /usr/share/doc .
AFAIK the *real* reason behind info being that it came from ITS (along
with EMACS). IIRC the ITS RUNOFF was much weaker than troff and it wasn't
easy to run from within TECO. Oh, well... At least GNU doesn't use DDT
clone instead of shell...

Yeah, except that it's blatantly incompatible with other Unices. When you
have telnet session to SunOS box in one VC, shell session (Linux) on
another and telnet to OpenBSD on the third... Consistency becomes an
issue. Hrrrmmm... new book for O'Reilly, anyone? "GNU Annoyances"...
	Said that, the only real responce to GNU policy being to maintain
alternative version of their documentation. In sane format. So we may
bitch about their choice, but it doesn't oblige anyone to anything. They
have the perfect right to choose whatever format they like, even if it's
an uuencoded Word document and in case of gcc they are the only game in
the town...
