in the previous email I sent you I told you 2.2.4 can't compile e2fsprogs but I meant 2.4.0...you probably figured it out already since I mentioned test2 & test3 but just wanted to make things clear. By the way, the compiling error I get is the folowing:
swapfs.c: In function `ext2fs_swap_inode':
swapfs.c:119: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer
swapfs.c:120: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer
swapfs.c:121: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer
swapfs.c:122: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer
make[1]: *** [swapfs.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/e2fsprogs-1.18/lib/ext2fs'
make: *** [all-libs-recursive] Error 1
