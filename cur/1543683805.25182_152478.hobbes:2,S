while writing the code to do it, I noticed the heuristic was already
there in cvsps ;), and it is generic (not hardwired to the ChangeSet
file). I had bad luck diffing with -r v2_4_22-pre3 (which is missing
from the changeset file too, so I guess the info is missing in bitkeeper
as well, not just bkcvs).  Infact probably it's a long time that you
dropped the tags from all files, and I noticed only now after getting
the error diffing against 22pre3 ;).

Peter, any suggestion on this? Larry said it's all on your side, so I
assume you're running bkcvs yourself, or Larry is already providing you
a locking mechanism that serializes against bkcvs and that allows you
to fetch a coherent of the cvs repository. w/o this last locking bit
that allows to export a coherent copy of the repository, I can't easily
automate the stuff based on a local repository and I've to switch to the
remote one, despite having it local is more flexible (and much faster
for local browsing) and rsync -z is faster.
Many thanks again to both of you and last but not the least to David
Mansfiel (cvsps author).
Andrea
