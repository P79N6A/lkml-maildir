Desirable.

Which would indicate that we might have expressions-with-side-effects
inside pr_debug() statements somewhere, which is risky.  I wonder where?
It looks like the version of gcc which you used is correctly discarding the
pr_debug() format string.  gcc hasn't always done that, and there's a risk
of bloatiness on older gccs.  I checked gcc-3.3.2/x86 and it does the right
thing, so...
btw, what's up with aio.c using a combination of pr_debug() and dprintk(),
and a combination of `#ifdef DEBUG' and `#if DEBUG > 1'?  Confusing.
It would be nice to have a single way of doing developer-debug in-tree.  We
have 182(!) different definitions of dprintk().  Please nobody cc me on that
discussion though ;)
