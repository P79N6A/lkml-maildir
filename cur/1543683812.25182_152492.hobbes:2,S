Hi list,
We have a monolithic kernel 2.4.18 using ip-tables. The ftp contrack
module takes a optional parameter port=xxxxx.
This parameter should be puttable by the kernel parameters. So I put it
on the addons line in lilo.conf.
The parameter doesn't show up in the boot dmesg, I can see it in
/proc/cmdline, but it doesn't seem to work. No ftp connection can be
made on this port.
Could anzbody put me a hint?
Thanks in advance
Frank
