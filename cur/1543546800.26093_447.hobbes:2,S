Sorry. close() is the only way to do this. 8)
I had to break semantics of shutdown() making it working
on not-connected sockets to help these folks.

The situation is the same _exactly_.
The only thing, why f_count, fget() and fput() are required
is to hold temporary references, when kernel cannot allow
destruction.
User references must be counted separately.
Actually, Linus seems to forget about his own idea
of returning valid error from close(). Think, how it is possible
to return valid error, when fput() is used to close file.
Also, lingering (i.e. waiting for looong time) in fput() smells
interesting. 8)
