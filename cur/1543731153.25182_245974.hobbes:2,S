Why?
You should always have a current vanilla linus-2.6 BK tree
locally, and just pull into it occaisionally.  Then when
you want to do work just clone it using links:
	bk clone -l linus-2.6 drm-2.6
and fire away. This is the fastest way.
If you're going:
	bk clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 drm-2.6
then no wonder it takes all evening :-)
When I rebase I just go:
	cd linus-2.6
	bk pull
	cd ..
	mv tree treework
	bk clone -l linus-2.6 tree
	cd tree
	bk pull ../treework
and that takes less than 10 minutes even on my super slow
UltraSPARC machines :-)
