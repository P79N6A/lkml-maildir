Or maybe a whitelist instead, since nearly all existing hardware
pre-dates FUA commands.
Or maybe just have a libata function to test whether the FUA commands
actually work or not, before enabling them for general use.
*That* could be a much better approach, given the large number of
possible drive/controller combos, and it cuts down on the maintenance
headache of having to list everything on a list somewhere.

David:  we need to see the output from "hdparm --Istdout /dev/sda
(or whichever drive it was that was failing on your system).
