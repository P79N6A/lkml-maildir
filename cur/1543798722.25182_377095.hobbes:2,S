Mutual exclusion is available with various semantical characteristics.
If you want to have a particular semantical functionality you have to
chose a variant which fits that need. Arguing that the underlying
mechanism (implemenation) can handle your request is broken by
definition. It can, but it still is semantically wrong.
Mutexes have a well defined semantic of lock ownership, i.e. the thread
which locked a mutex has to unlock it. Semaphores do not have this
semantical requirement.
Therefor, if you want to handle that "init protection" scenario, do not
use a mutex, because the owner can not be defined at compile -
allocation time.
You can still implement (chose a mechanism) a mutex on top - or in case
of lack of priority inheritance or debugging with exactly the same -
mechanism as a semaphore, but this does not change the semantical
difference at all.
