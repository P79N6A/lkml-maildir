I'm using GCC 3.0.1 and seeing "multi-line literals are deprecated".
Since a patch is necessary for that (and someone submitted it already)
I'd like to hear from big kernel guys what asm statement style to use:
	asm(
"		cmd	r,r\n"
"lbl:		cmd	r,r\n"
"		cmd	r,r\n"
		: spec
		: spec
	);
[variable width for labels? I don't like it] or
	asm(
	"	cmd	r,r\n"
	"lbl:	cmd	r,r\n"
	"	cmd	r,r\n"
		: spec
		: spec
	);
[better. But \n's are ugly] or
#define NL "\n"
	asm(
	"	cmd	r,r" NL
	"lbl:	cmd	r,r" NL
	"	cmd	r,r" NL
		: spec
		: spec
	);
[I like this: \n doesn't interfere with args]
or what?
