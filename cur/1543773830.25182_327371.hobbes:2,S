Yes. You can just use a global variable because the smp bootup is essentially
single threaded. printk would destroy the timing though.
Start with the code that prints ExtInt enabled. 
Writ current_text_address() into a buffer and dump it then on CPU #0
after some timeout (hopefully it is still alive) 
If you have problems mail me and I will write you a tracing patch
tomorrow.
