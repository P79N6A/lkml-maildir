My timer is finally using the clockevent subsystem. Below is the
output of '/proc/timer_list':

My question is about the clock resolution field which is equal to 1ns.
How is this possible since my timer's frequency is only 100Mhz ?
My 2 cents, it looks like some tabs are missing when printing the list
of hrtimers of each clock...
Thanks
