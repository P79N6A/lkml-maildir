You haven't pushed your system, or run it in a hostile
environment then.  There are many places where systems are run
right up to the edge of thermal breakdown, and it's a firm
requirement to know exactly what that edge is.

I have a CPU that runs great up to 43C, and shuts down hard at 44C
so I obviously want to know how close I am to that.  I don't want
rounding errors to get in the way, and I don't want changes
between kernel revs to affect it either.
If we've got the bitspace, keep the counters as granular as
possible within the useable range that we're designing for.
counter = .01 * degrees kelvin
