Hm.  Doing any kind of lazy-state operation with preemption enabled is
fundamentally meaningless.  How does it get into a preemptable state
with a lazy mode enabled now?  If a sequence of code with preempt
disabled touches a missing vmalloc mapping, it gets a fault to fix up
the mapping, and the fault handler can end up preempting the thread? 
That sounds like a larger bug than just paravirt lazy mode problems.
