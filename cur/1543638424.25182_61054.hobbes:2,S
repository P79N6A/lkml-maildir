How the heck did you get get bit 4 of the dma_status register to report
anything other than "0" ??
Next "HTH", did it manage to invoke an DMA Error and Interrupt and return
a the drive back in to command mode with a 50 stat ?
I have never been so amazed by this driver's ablity to invoke hardware
events that can not happen.
