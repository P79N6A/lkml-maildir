No it means you have 512+k buckets  (*4 on UP; *8 on SMP for bytes = ~4MB) 
for the established hash and 64k for the bind hash (the later is only 
used internally and searched for netstat).
4MB for a hash table looks ridiculously large to me.

the size is the problem. walking an 4MB table will be always slow.
