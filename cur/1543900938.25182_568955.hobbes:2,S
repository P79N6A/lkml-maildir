Cool.  It's good to do that, but not the problem I'm worried about solving.
I was trying to describe the minimum requirements for being a language 
maintainer, I.E. what non-english users need in order to be able to merge 
their patches.  Because without someone to contribute patches to (I.E a 
language maintainer), documentation in non-english languages promotes the 
creation of patches that can't be merged.  That's the problem I'm trying to 
solve.
To me, finding language maintainers is the flip side of the coin of 
translating documentation.
