But the genius is that you don't need to calculate anything.  If the
data block turns out to be incompressible (those damn .tar.bz2s!), you
just write the block in-place.  If it is compressible, you write as much
into that block's entry as you need and leave a gap.  The underlying
file system doesn't write any data there.  There's no need for an index
file -- you know exactly where to start reading each block.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
