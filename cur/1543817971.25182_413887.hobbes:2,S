That is correct, that the color_map attribute will break. Color_map is
not in general use outside the Mesa development community.
The whole scheme of using sysfs instead of IOCTLs is not working out
very well for framebuffer. The original idea was to let you control
your framebuffer with simple scripts or from the keyboard. But since
the attributes don't strip \n and blanks, it has made them more
complex to use from the keyboard.
The one attribute per file model doesn't work well when the attributes
need to be changed in a transaction. For example you want to change
your display to 1024x768 16bit color.  As you set the attributes one
at a time the display has to change since there is not guarantee that
you will complete the sequence. The framebuffer sysfs interface breaks
the one attribute per file rule and uses strings for grouped
attributes.
Ultimately I expect framebuffer will switch back to a helper app and
binary IOCTLs. Mainly because the help app can signal begin/end around
a change to a group of attributes.
