Have you read it? Do you not realize That it optimizes down to BUG() or
the standard min/max? By BUG(), I was hoping that somebody could 
produce some magic that doesn't even compile when it reduces to that,
but maybe that's too much to hope for from gcc.

If that's the limit of the audiences intelligence, I don't think
I'll bother bothering to think next time! I rather hoped instead
for people to pick up the idea and tell me about the problem
left to cover (void* ? what if the arch does not have 2's complement
arithmetic?)
