Hi,
I remember very vaguely Alexander Viro mentioning some easily 
reproducible deadlock when doing mmap followed by write in some specific 
sequence (or a page cache in some specific state?).
Can you please remind me of the scenario - weekend is at hand and one 
needs to do something about it.
Regards,
Tigran.
