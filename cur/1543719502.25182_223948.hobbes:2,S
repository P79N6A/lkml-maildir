That's ok.  Most users have no idea that their "Surecom 1234 Zippy 
Ethernet" is really an 8139 chip, and that they need the 8139too driver.
Kernel configuration is for kernel developers, kernel vendors 
(distributions), and power users, all of whom are expected to know what 
they are doing.
So, I disagree with that argument.
However...

...I won't reject arguments based on general annoyance, or specific 
annoyance at the categorizing.  This change was the way I preferred that 
the network driver Kconfig start moving, with future categorizations as 
well -- the overall goal being that eventually you'll select among 
several classes of devices, instead of today's innumerably long list of 
devices from the first days of ethernet to today's 10Gbps.
The easy fix is just to cset -x the change I commited.  Ethernet and 
"gigabit ethernet" will be in separate menus, but there will not a 
separate CONFIG_NET_GIGE option.  I won't complain, if people feel 
'cset -x' is warranted.  It's just a config option, not anything 
terribly important[1]
