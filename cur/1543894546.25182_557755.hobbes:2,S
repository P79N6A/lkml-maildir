I think we can just disable the optimization, and (in a separate patch)
add it back in emulator_write_phys(), where we know we're modifying
memory and not hitting mmio.
Incidentally, in Xen, where this code originated from, this emulator is
used only for page table updates (which are always to memory).  A
separate emulator is used for mmio.  I guess the optimization targets
the vm scanner doing test_and_clear_bit() type of operations against the
page tables' dirty bits.
