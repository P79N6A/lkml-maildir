It didn't apply cleanly, I had one reject from menubox.c, which I had to 
apply manually.
Anyway, some minor comments about the code:

These should be static.

You can join this with cdone(), they are always called together.

This could be "if (!items[item_no]) cmake()" to allocate the data as 
needed. Increment item_no after you done, this avoids also all the 
"item_no - 1" as index.

Could you change the tag field of dialog_list_item into a "char type" and 
a void pointer? I don't really see a reason to convert them from/into 
strings anymore.

Could you please add this one back and just reinitialize curses? (I 
actually liked the new resize feature. :) )
BTW just add the other patch to this one, it's not that important to keep 
it separate.
