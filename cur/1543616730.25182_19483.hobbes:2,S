Yes, but that makes sense if the one that receives double as much
CPU time as the others _needs_ that CPU time. For example, an idle
MTA _should_ not receive as much CPU time as an overworked proxy
server... Yet, unless someone changes the priority, they are treated
evenly by the scheduler. This is not so good in my mind.

Is it possible for the scheduler to take into account another parameter
than priority to decide an app' CPU affinity ? For example, size
in memory and %CPU. For example, if an app accounts for
80% of the total CPU utilisation, by all means it should stay
on the same CPU. That, in my mind, would have the effect that this
app would run faster (because of the cache) AND that the load on
the machine would decrease (having to bump that app from one
CPU to another is _not_ good).
Is this feasible, or am I dreaming ?
