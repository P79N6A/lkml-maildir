The swapoff algorithms in 2.2 and 2.4 are basically identical.
The problem *appears* worse in 2.4 because it uses lots
more swap.

Yes. The sys_swapoff() system call can take many minutes
of CPU time.  It basically does:
	for (each page in swap device) {
		for (each process) {
			for (each page used by this process)
				stuff
It's interesting that you've found a case where this
actually has an operational impact.
Haven't looked at it closely, but I think the algorithm
could become something like:
	for (each process) {
		for (each page in this process) {
			if (page is on target swap device)
				get_it_off()
		}
	}
	for (each page in swap device) {
		if (it is busy)
			complain()
	}
That's 10^4 to 10^6 times faster.
