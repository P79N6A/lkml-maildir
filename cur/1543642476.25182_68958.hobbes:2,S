I don't think you should be using a device number at all.  ioctl is Evil
(TM) and it's perfectly possible to write an IPMI driver which uses
neither an ioctl nor a chaacter device.  Voila:

yes, it was stupid to call it BMC instead of IPMI.  i was handed a pile
of junk that'd been half-heartedly ported from windows.  however, the
principle is sound, you don't need ioctl, nor a character device.
