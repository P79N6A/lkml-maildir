Hi!
With latest ACPI and patrick's patches, S1 *somehow* works. I can
enter it, and can exit it, userland is still alive, but all hardware
devices are dead.
But patrick's code explicitely does not resume devices when returning
from S1:
        if (state > ACPI_SLEEP_S1)
                pm_send_all(PM_RESUME,(void*)0);
Does that mean my hardware is buggy, or is something wrong with
interrupts?
