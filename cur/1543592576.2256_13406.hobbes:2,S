I think the right way to fix it is to do a final atomic check for softirqs 
when the kernel is exited. To be atomic this check neededs to be done with 
interrupts off until the kernel exited. I just implemented a very similar way 
into the x86-64 kernel (which needs to turn off interrupts for kernel anyways 
for other reasons, this just extends the cli area a bit). The same atomic
check is needed for race free check of need_schedule (which is still racy
on plain i386).
