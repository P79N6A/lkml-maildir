That would sure pump up the blacklist, all right.
I think at this point the right thing for me to do is gather data on the
scope of the problem.  I have some ideas about that.

It is the assumption of this book that a work of art is a gift, not a
commodity.  Or, to state the modern case with more precision, that works of
art exist simultaneously in two "economies," a market economy and a gift
economy.  Only one of these is essential, however: a work of art can survive
without the market, but where there is no gift there is no art.
