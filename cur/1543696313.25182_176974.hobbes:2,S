Hi All,
Just want to announce that a Driver Model Regression test has been added
to OSDL's Scalable Test Platform.
http://www.osdl.org/lab_activities/kernel_testing/stp/
The test is a series of scripts and modules built outside of the kernel
to help stress test the driver model.  An extensible amount of busses,
drivers, classes, class devices, and devices are loaded and unloaded in
parallel in an attempt to push the driver model to its limits.  The
execution time is measured and given as output upon a successful test
completion.  It is the goal of this test to detect any performance
regressions (or improvements) on previous or newly released kernels. 
Thanks so much,
Leann
