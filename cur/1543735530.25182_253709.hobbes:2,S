How is the kernel to know which changes of process data require
re-examination? In all likelihood, any tool is only going to be
interested in certain changes, not in others.

It seems reasonable (and useful) to notify tools if new processes get
created. It is certainly possible to have additional events (like field
changes) trigger notifications, but this would probably become rather
intrusive and expensive.

No, your data types have to match what the kernel offers. What I was
referring to was your request for "info in groups that match what /proc
provides today". What you _can_ do with nproc is, say, ask it to return
a pointer to something like this:
struct statm_extended {
	__u32 pid;	/*
	__u32 namelen;	 * My simple cookie
	char name[16];	 */
	__u32 resident;	/*
	__u32 shared;	 *
	__u32 trs;	 * /proc/PID/statm content
	__u32 lrs;	 *
	__u32 drs;	 *
	__u32 dt;	 */
};
