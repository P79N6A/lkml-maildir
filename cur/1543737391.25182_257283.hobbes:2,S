Drivers are free to call as many libraries as they want....
radeon - attached to hardware
   drm - library
   fb - library
      fbcon - library
   km - library
Libraries are kernel modules that don't attach to any specific
hardware, they just supply routines for other drivers to call. We
might want to change the name of these to libdrm, libfb, libkm.
I haven't looked into Gatos yet but I'd like to see the radeon
converted to follow the model of all of the other vl4 cards instead of
having it's own system. In the X on GL world the 2D XAA radeon driver
is gone. Gatos support will need to live somewhere else.
