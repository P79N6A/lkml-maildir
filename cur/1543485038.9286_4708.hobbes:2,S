    That's a nice sentiment, but if you break binary compatability
    (which is useful for modules you have the source for as well; a
    fixed binary interface (like, umm, UDI) makes it easier to mix and
    match device drivers and not be forced to follow kernel revisions or
    do lots of hackery if you want to support something, like the xia
    filesystem, that's not supported in the kernel de jour), you're
    only fixing it if you consider backwards compatability to be a bug.
