   Outbound-connections are limited by the local portrange, changeable
   in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
   (ran into this on one of my proxy servers, having thousands of connections
   in the state CLOSING, TIME_WAIT and LAST_ACK - after
   echo "1024 16383" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range the box at
   least stays working)
In current 2.4.14-preX, this is not true anymore.  It is limited
by something approximating "local port range X number of unique
destination IP addresses" because if the remote address is unique
we allow multiple local port binds to occur on the same local port.
Franks a lot,
