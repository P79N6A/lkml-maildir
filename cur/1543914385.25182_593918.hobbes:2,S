thx! If you've got some time, could you perhaps re-measure with these 
disabled:
  CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y
  CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y
these options mask some of the performance enhancements we made. There's 
also a new code drop at:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/devel/
with some fixes for SMP. (and you've got an SMP box it appears)
also, if you want to maximize performance, it usually makes more sense 
to build with these flipped around:
  # CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE is not set
  CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING=y
i.e.:
  CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y
  # CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING is not set
because especially on modern x86 CPUs, smaller x86 code is faster. (and 
it also takes up less I-cache size)
