We do that already. In fact, they always do that unless they're explicitly
migrated (in both NUMA and SMP cases) by the rebalancer.

Read the code. It does pretty much exactly this already ;-)
Especially look at sched_balance_exec(), and balance_node()

It does, kind of ... in fact they all stay on the same runqueue. We need
to train the numa rebalancer to move multiple tasks in the case of heavy
imbalances, but it needs some care to avoid migrating short load spikes.
Moving from nr_running snapshots to load averages will probably fix it.

Right - that's why it's hard ;-) Fixing any one case is easy ... fixing
all of them simultaneously is extremely difficult ;-)
