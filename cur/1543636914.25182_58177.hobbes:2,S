Hello everyone,
I would like to send some SMART commands in linux. One of the command I'd like to send is return_smart_status and I needed some extra data that the device would return in Cylinder_Low and Cylinder_High registers. 
I have tried to use the HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, but I think this can't help me with the above operation.
I tried using the inw_p and outw_p, inb_p, outb_p, but with these, i usually receive the "lost interrupt" message.
Does anyone here have suggestions on what i should do?
Please reply, and thank you for your time,
-Ana
