On the issue of  static int foo = 0;  vs.  static int foo;  I'd agree
with Andries' view. It's a common enough idiom that it is useful to
convey the intentions of the programmer.
On "optimizing" changes: there are plenty of very ugly things you can
do to a C program to make source or object code smaller (e.g. use only
one-character identifiers for smaller code; re-use variables as much
as possible, maybe with casts for smaller stack footprint, etc.). We
usually avoid these too, so a few extra initializations in the source
shouldn't hurt.
On the .data segment size: if all the energy that went into this
thread would have gone into implementing a gcc option to move all-zero
.data objects to .bss, the technical side of the problem would be
solved already ;-)

Hmm, sometimes a panic _is_ the right answer, though. If a critical
subsystem just politely returns an error to user space and tries to
continue, it may take a while until somebody realizes that there's
something wrong at all ...
