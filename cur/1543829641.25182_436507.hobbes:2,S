The reason for sending out sum of siblings's stats was as follows:
I didn't maintain a per-tgid data structure in-kernel where the exiting 
threads taskstats could be accumalated
, erroneously thinking that this would require such a structure to be 
*additionally* updated each  time a statististic
was being collected and that would be way too much overhead. Also to 
save on space. 
Thus if userspace wants to get the per-tgid stats for the thread group 
when the last thread exits, then it cannot
do so by querying since such a query only returns the sum of currently 
live threads (data from exited threads is lost).
So, the current design chooses to return the sum of all siblings + self 
when each thread exits. Using this userspace
can maintain the per-tgid data for all currently living threads of the 
group + previously exited threads.
But as pointed out in an earlier mail, it looks like this is 
unnecessarily elaborate way of trying to avoid maintaining
a separate per-tgid data structure in the kernel (in addition to the 
per-tid ones we already have).
What can be done is to create a taskstats structure for a thread group 
the moment the *second* thread gets created.
Then each exiting thread can accumalate its stats to this struct. If 
userspace queries for per-tgid data, the sum of all
live threads + value in this struct can be returned. And when the last 
thread of the thread group exits, the struct's
value can be output.
While this will mean an extra taskstats structure hanging around for the 
lifetime of a multithreaded app (not single threaded
ones), it should cut down on the overhead of running through all threads 
that we see in the current design.
More importantly, it will reduce the frequency of per-tgid data send to 
once for each thread group exit  instead of once
per thread exit.
Will that work for everyone ?

In the above design, if a userspace query for per-tgid data arrives, 
then I'll still need to run through
all the threads of a thread group (to return their sum + that of already 
exited threads accumalated in the
extra per-tgid taskstats struct).
So that could still benefit from such a thread group specific lock. 
Scope of change is a bit more of course
so will need to take a closer look.
