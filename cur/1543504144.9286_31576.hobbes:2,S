No.  For read IO, the data is copied precisely once.  The kernel does
DMA directly from disk into the page cache, and then the data is copied
into user space.

True, although using threads can help.

Absolutely not.  If you want to find out where the time is being spent,
try "man readprofile".  You'll probably find that it's in the IO
request layers and drivers, but not in the caches.

That's what mmap() does.  There is truly no copy involved.
For writes, 2.2 does perform more copies than necessary, but that is
cured in 2.3.

Is this on 2.0 or 2.2?  2.2 adds extra readahead for sequential mmap
access which allows us to reach disk bandwidth for applications like
grep().
