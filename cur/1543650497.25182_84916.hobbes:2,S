I'm going to leave the merging of this to the scsi people, in particular 
James and Doug. My personal feeling right now is that it's not going in 
the feature freeze, but as a driver thing I'm also convinced that 
especially if vendors need it, they'll add it anyway - and drivers tend to 
be less "frozen" than core code anyway (by necessity: we've always had to 
accept new drivers even in stable series).
