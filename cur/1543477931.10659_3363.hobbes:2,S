Note that this can be done in user space: the only way the mouse
communicates with the host is by sending and receiving bytes on the
wire. For that you have the write() and read() calls.
Compare to a serial port: surely you don't expect the serial driver
to automatically detect when a mouse or a modem is hot-plugged into
a serial port?
Besides, I don't think the PS/2 mouse was intended to be
hot-pluggable. There have been reports of fried ports on this
list.
