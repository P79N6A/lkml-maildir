I just booted into this and got this in the log shortly after:
Jan 28 04:14:50 pimp kernel: kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1) task from c9fff8c0! 
Jan 28 04:15:31 pimp kernel: kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (4) task from c9fff8c0! 
Jan 28 04:19:42 pimp kernel: kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (2) task from c9fff8c0! 
The scond one I got at the same moment as I opened a new ssh session to the
box.
Hmm, and just as I pasted those in (I'm using pine on the box from remote) I
got:
Jan 28 04:20:11 pimp kernel: kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1) task from c9fff8c0!
and they keep on coming. Always the same address. I have 4 ssh-sessions open to
the box.
The adress is outside the kernel, it's map is ending at:
c024c6dc A _end
(and grep c9f /proc/ksyms gives nothing)
