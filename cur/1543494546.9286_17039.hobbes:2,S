The notion of 'raw' disk is foreign to Linux. Its a Unixism. The block device
interface is used instead. That isnt optimised for performance however (ie
heavy readahead etc)

If you want to get an accurate disk/controller benchmark you might want to
get Stephen Tweedie's O_DIRECT patches (ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/sct) which
give you what are logically the same thing - uncached I/O from the disk
itself. My only concern is that if FreeBSD does do a copy through kernel
space for its raw devices you may not be making an appropriate comparison
benchmark for some things as Linux would be going userspace->media
