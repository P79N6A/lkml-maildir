Hello,
How much memory would it be reasonable for kmalloc() to be able
to allocate to a module?
Oct 30 10:48:31 chaos kernel: kmalloc: Size (524288) too large 
Using Version 2.2.17, I can't allocate more than 64k!  I need
to allocate at least 1/2 megabyte and preferably more (like 2 megabytes).
There are 256 megabytes of SDRAM available. I don't think it's
reasonable that a 1/2 megabyte allocation would fail, especially
since it's the first module being installed.
The attempt to allocate is memory of type GFP_KERNEL.
Any advice?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
