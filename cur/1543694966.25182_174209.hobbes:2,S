I have experienced the same behavior while playing with APM/ACPI
suspend. It seems my machine gets frozen when trying to suspend with
CardBus/USB modules loaded, so I usually unload them before suspending.
Sometimes, I have seen the kernel complaining while unloading 3c59x with
an usage count greater than 1, which is impossible, since I do only have
a network card on my laptop and it's the 3Com.
