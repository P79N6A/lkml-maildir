Maybe it is.
Sorry Serge, this was actually the first of two patches from Oleg and I
only copied you on the first (since that is where I started the
discussion), oops!
The reason this has become so difficult is largely my fault and it is
entirely due to my lack of understanding of how automount will play
within pid namespaces.
But your last reply to me was very helpful in this regard, thanks for
your patience. So this painful discussion has been useful, at least to
me.
I see you've already backed out part of your original change, which may
have been a little premature, as I can likely go back and review the
original patches now.
