I'm just wondering if it could be a relation to the disk aswell or so..

Heh, thanks =)
Now, about this ACPI powersave thing, wouldn't that be enabled in
windows aswell? So wouldn't this workaround be something that $other_os
doesn't have to do.
(In general i have always had to hack windows into not crashing when
linux worked and doing it the other way around without a real fix dosn't
sound that nice in my ears.. =P)
It would be interesting to hear from nvidia about nmi_watchdog... Since
nmi_watchdog with the 'not-done-correctly' APIC patch claims that nmi is
stalled/locked/doesn't work... If nvidia states that this *should* work,
then we have something to go on.
Also, if Allen Martin (nvidia) could go trough the proc/interrupts and
tell us if something is wrong, like the XT-PIC on timer. Or just give us
a correct listing, since noone had io-apic-edge on timer before afair.
