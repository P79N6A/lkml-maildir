Maybe you can reparent it like ptrace does:
                if (child->p_pptr != current) {
                        REMOVE_LINKS(child);
                        child->p_pptr = current;
                        SET_LINKS(child);
                }
                send_sig(SIGSTOP, child, 1);
Haven't tried it, just an idea.
Best,
Borislav
