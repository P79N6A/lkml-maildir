	Encountering these is a sign that you are dividing
	64 bit quantities (e.g. i_size, or file position) with
	e.g. blocksize.
	If your blocksizes are always power of two, you have
	no problems of turning them into shift expressions
	by precomputing the log2() of the blocksize to be
	used as the shift.
	If your blocksizes are not always power of two, things
	become a bit more complicated, but then propably your
	maximum filesize is just 2G, not 2^63 ..  Try casting
	position/size via (long), and you should be home free.
	The GCC intrinsics are rather slow code, and thus should
	not be used in fast paths.
