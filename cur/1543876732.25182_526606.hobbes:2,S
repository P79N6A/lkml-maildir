rt10 shows a big improvement over rt8

very nice for a "work in progress" 
I ran the netperf test a few times and one of the times the netperf test would no longer talk to the server. I had to reboot the rt client to get netperf to talk again. I did have cycle soak running which may have contributed to the problem.
Also when netperf is not running the hard IRQs associated with the NIC use a constant 2% load.
Thanks,
Dave
