Rather than guessing, maybe a check of what the source code actually *does*

(3) Recognize that a sysadmin who intentionally goes and creates a
/etc/nologin via insane means deserves the insane results.  You have to
go out of your way to actually create a case where the distinction between
"exists" and "is readable" matters.
Having said that, we probably *should* fix 'man login' to say 'is readable'.
