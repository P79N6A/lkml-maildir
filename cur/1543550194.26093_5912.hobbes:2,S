  Hello.
  So I did the fixes of races in quota Al found. The patch can
be found at 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/v2.4/quota-fix-2.4.0-test8-1.diff.
  In the patch are included also some cleanups (especially change in
invalidate_dquots()) which I originally wanted to leave for 2.5 but they
simplified fixing of races a lot. The patch seems to work for me but
I didn't test it heavily.
  I'd be grateful if anybody else tried the patch too. It shouldn't eat
your data but oopses are possible...
