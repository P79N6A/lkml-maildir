forwarded messge below.
Thought it was interesting enough.
Remark: after the attack there are lines like the following in messages:
Mar  8 00:10:55 tantalus sshd[242]: error: accept: No route to host
looks like the routes have vanished, but the interface is still active
attached is the kernel configuration, just in case
one additional output from messages not included in email below (111.111.111.111 and 'tantalus' inserted by me, don't know if the guy sending the email wants his hosts IP/name in the public).

----------------------------------------
Hi,
I am having strange problems with my Alphastation 500, now running Kernel
2.2.3 (the problem turned up with kernel 2.0.35 and 2.2.2ac7). That when the
maschine gets attacked, the network interface (eth0) stops working. What
happens : I can ping my own eth0 from the console, but pinging the network
times out. Likewise an other host on the internet cannot ping my Server.
The fact that this accured with 2.2.2ac7 and 2.0.35 leads me to belive  it
may  not be kerrnel problem. But what i found strange was the server was up
the whole day. syn_cookie support was in the kernel, but not enabled. at
about 22:00 CET i enabled that with "echo 1 >
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies" and while later (about 20 min - 30 min)
the connection died on me ( i was logged in with telnet) .. and after that
there was no more answer till i reset the server this morning.
The Server is Running :
Kernel 2.2.3 (was 2.2.2ac7 yesterday)
Apache 1.3.4 & PHP 3.07 & Ben-SSL 1.3.1
Sendmail 8.9.3
I compiled thease programs with egcs 1.1.1
/var/log/messages shows :
Mar 10 22:54:38 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies.
Mar 10 22:55:39 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies.
Mar 10 22:56:39 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies.
Mar 10 22:57:39 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies.
<snip>
Mar 11 02:13:13 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies.
One other wierd thing : named was not running .. and there were no hourly
stats in the log file ..
hmm wonder if thats got anything to do with it...
no other strange log messages ..
Update : i just had an other telnet session open ( this time 2.2.3) and the
network I/F died again :((
I booted the alpha about 1,5 hours ago ..
and again . in /var/log/messages
Mar 11 11:45:13 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies
<snip>
Mar 11 11:55:08 tantalus kernel: possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending
cookies.
I will update BIND, inetd , and net-tools , but if that doesn't help .. i am clueless
and disable syn_cookie support . .(could it be buggy ?)
and boy are my customers unhappy
Regards
(someone)
