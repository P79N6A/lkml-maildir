This is a followup to my earlier post about the
effect of the low latency patch on 2.4.18-pre6.
As it was pointed out, the stock kernel didn't
do badly. This is true, so I have conducted a
more stressful test to help highlight the effects
of the low latency patch.
In this test I ran a dbench sequence of 3 reps
each of dbench (1, 2, 4 ... 128), while doing
normal desktop activities e.g. pysol, reading
mail, running aim. The tested system also acts
as an iptables firewall for 3 internal hosts, but
the load is light.
As the results show, the histogram for the
low latency kernel is short and sweet. The
histogram for the stock kernel is rather more
involved. The low latency kernel also shows
no degredation in dbench results compared
to the stock kernel.
The histograms were generated as before:
1. start realfeel
2. run the dbench test
3. send sigint to realfeel to dump the histograms
4. generate the graphs with the included script
5. compare and contrast the results
The dbench results:
