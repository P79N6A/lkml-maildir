Yeap.  The "idiot" removed the proc interface from the driver before
publishing the updated tools  -- and I said so at the time.  At the time
the interface was removed, the new tools weren't available - period.  They
are still "beta" today (several months later.)
Just put the procfs code back in the driver in your local tree and
walk away.  That's what I did -- but it doesn't look like I commited
it to any BK tree :-( (and that box is *ahem* powered off)
