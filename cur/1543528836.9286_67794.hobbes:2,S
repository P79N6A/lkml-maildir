Lawrence, I'm not sure how much memory your machine has or what is running
on it but if you had 40M in buffers something did a lot of non-filesystem
IO(like
a "du" command or a bunch or reads from a raw device).  Then in order for the
buffers to drop back to 4M you had to run out of memory and shrink_mmap had
to reclaim that 36M from the buffermem.
