Well, it's probably ok to use SYSEXIT for system calls, but I was thinking
of the non-system-call case where you _really_ cannot clobber %edx/%ecx.
Clobbering registers on page faults is considered rude ;)
Maybe we can't use SYSEXIT for non-system-calls, but it would just be so
nice if there were no special cases. A user-space trampoline that restores
%ecx/%edx after the SYSEXIT would allow that. But it may just be too
complex to really worry about.
