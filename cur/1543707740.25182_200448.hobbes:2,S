In principle, the lvm/md queues themselves will never be congested. But
the underlying queues can be, of course.
Now this approach is _much_ better, imo. I don't particularly care very
much for how you solved it, though, I'd much rather just see both
setting and testing passed down (and kill the ->aux as well).
Regardless of the initial hw depth vs block depth (which is also a
generic device problem, not just dm related), this would be a good
addition to the congestion logic.
