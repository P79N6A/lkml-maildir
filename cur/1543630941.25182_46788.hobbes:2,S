1. It's been stated here on LKML several times that optical drives
   should NOT be connected to Promise chips. It may work with Promise's
   Windows drivers, but that doesn't help here. A better strategy is to
   connect your CD-ROMs and Zip drive to the KT266A, and any IDE disks
   either to the FastTrak or the Ultra66 add-on card (though from your
   `lspci` I suppose your disks are SCSI).
2. "noapic" only controls whether the I/O-APIC is used or not.
   If you want to test without the _local_ APIC being enabled,
   then I'm afraid you have to rebuild the kernel with
   CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC disabled.
