I just released util-linux-2.9p (the standard places minus tsx-11).
[The NLS support is still very weak.]
[Earlier I had wondered about strange reports of deleted partitions
that came back after a reboot. But the reports have been misleading -
no kernel problem but just yet another fdisk bug, hopefully fixed now.]
