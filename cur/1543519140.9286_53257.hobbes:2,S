       This doesn't address the problem. First, the threads need to
   refer to *different* graphics contexts. Second, the API requires
   that these contexts be identified by some thread-specific mechanism
   available to the graphics library, not by explicit stack pointers
   in the application - whether that mechanism is private mappings or
   tarot cards matters not, so long as it's extremely fast.
So fork()'d processes store the graphics library shared state in
a shared/writable mapping area.
What you proposed is: threads + thread local mappings
Linus is suggesting instead: processes + shared mappings
The latter provides what you'd like to do without any of the
overhead or complexity assosicated with the former.  And I think
that alone will make up for whatever performance advantages are
obtained by the former.
As someone who intern'd at SGI for a few months and also saw how the
aforementioned IRIX mechanism works, I can definitely say this is
something we never want in Linux.  TLB miss trap handler changing
based upon if the thread has thread-local mappings, all the special
cases in vfault/pfault to find the correct page tables to lookup, no
thanks.
