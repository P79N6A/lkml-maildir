ACPI specifies a location in regular memory that is used to contain the
lock.  The lock is used both by the CPU and by the embedded controller
to cover access to shared registers.  We don't spin on this lock because
we don't know how long the embedded controller might hold it.  Instead
when we fail to acquire it we schedule an event to trigger when the lock
is free.
