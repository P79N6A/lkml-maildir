Doh, you're right.
Let's try the original idea, but a bit cleaner:
/* flags: */
#define MNT_CTRL_RECURSE (1 << 0)
/* mnt_flags: */
#define MNT_NOSUID	0x01
#define MNT_NODEV	0x02
#define MNT_NOEXEC	0x04
#define MNT_NOATIME	0x08
#define MNT_NODIRATIME	0x10
#define MNT_RELATIME	0x20
#define MNT_SHARED	0x1000
#define MNT_UNBINDABLE	0x2000
#define MNT_PNODE_MASK	0x3000
struct mount_param {
	u64 flags;		/* control flags */
	u64 mnt_flags;		/* new mount flags */
	u64 mnt_flags_mask;	/* mask for new mount flags */
};
int mount_bindat(int fromfd, const char *frompath,
		int tofd, const char *topath,
		struct mount_param *param);
int mount_setflagsat(int fd, const char *path,
		struct mount_param *param);
int mount_moveat(int fromfd, const char *frompath,
		 int tofd, const char *topath);
...
I deliberately not used the MS_* flags, which is currently a messy mix
of things with totally different meanings.
Does this solve all the issues?
