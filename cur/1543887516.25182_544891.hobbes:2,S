Yes, I agree. So according to you, what's the best way to address the
initial problem (i.e. PG_error never cleared)?

Yes, indeed. However, as soon as a call to get_block() fails,
do_mpage_readpage() will call block_read_full_page() which will attach
buffers to this page.
Consequently, all subsequent reads will go through block_read_full_page().
