Yes, that's true.
I checked several systems and didn't find any similar problems.
I think this situation is rare.
Besides, duplicate names are totally unusable for user space.
We should fix this kind of bugs ASAP if there are any.

Please review the patch below. :)
dump_stack is enough to debug the problem, so only the current duplicate
file names are printed out instead of the full pathname.
From: Zhang Rui <rui.zhang@intel.com>
File name should be unique in the same directory.
In order to keep the back-compatibility, only a warning is given
currently, but actions must be taken to fix it when such duplicates
are detected.
