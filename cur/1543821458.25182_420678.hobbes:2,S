This sysfs "enable" patch seems like goodness.
But I hope that when X uses this, it only enables & disables VGA
devices it's actually using.  In the past, it seems like X has
blindly disabled *all* VGA devices in the system, even though
they might be in use by another X server.  I'm sure that's all
well-understood and cleaned up now; just wanted to make sure
this nightmare didn't recur.
