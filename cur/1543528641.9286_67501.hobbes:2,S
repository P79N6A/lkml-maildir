Ok, so to try syn-cookies, I flooded my hp linux box (2.2.12) with fake
syn packets. And sure enuf even after the queue (bypassed by cookies,
anyway)  was full, a legitimate connection was allowed. But it went
something like this:
SERVER : Already SYN flooded, SYN Cookies on.
                                 S
Legit Client -----------> Server
                                    SA
Legit Client  <----------- Server                  // Inspite of flood!!
                                        A
Legit Client ------------> Server
//connection est.
                                       R
Legit Client  <----------- Server                          // :-( What
happened
I wold be grateful to someone who can solve the mystry of this last
reset packet for me.
Thanks!!
Aadi.
