I don't get it.  The substance of the patch is
+	/* check file descriptor */
+	exec_fileno = get_unused_fd();
+	if (exec_fileno < 0) {
+		ret = -EMFILE;
+		goto err;
+	}
+	get_file(bprm->file);
+	fd_install(exec_fileno, bprm->file);
and that get_file() will be undone by exit().  Without this change we'll
forget to do file limit checking.
So.. please tell us much more about the problem.
