Look at the few simple tests I have been posting - it clearly
indicates the need is decreased. I did say however that it would
be subject to CPU/bus/device overheads. I did not realiase
SCSI setups would behave like this. From a purely disk head
perspective it does nullify the need for readahead (though
it is obivously still needed for other reasons).
