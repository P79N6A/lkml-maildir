Thomas showed me a trick with the ktimers API, that I use to schedule my
custom scheduler.  If you set periodic_hook to be called via ktimer with a
prio of -1, it will force the timer to be run in the timer interrupt
instead of a softirq task.
Now the issue is the latency this would cause and to make sure that
periodic_hook only grabs raw locks. Ingo?
