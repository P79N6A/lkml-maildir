This is all backwards compatibility with folks expecting Irix behavior,
and I think on Irix it is even a backwards compatibility thing. If we
were not having a major power outage at work right now I could look
at Irix and confirm this. Imposing different semantics on the rest of
the filesystems did not seem like the right thing to do.
