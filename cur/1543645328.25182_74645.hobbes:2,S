--- Original announcement follows ---
RivaTV version 0.8.1 has been released.
The RivaTV project is trying to produce Linux drivers for graphics boards
with nVidia chips that have a video-in feature.
Changes in this release:
  This release includes support for GeForce 4, a lot of new cards and
several bugfixes. Also, tuner support has been improved and RivaTV now
comes with the relevant BTTV modules to get your tuner going - simply and
easily. Finally, the installation process tries to detect pitfalls
preventing the use of RivaTV on your machine.
Everyone is strongly encouraged to update to this version!
Regards,
RivaTV team
