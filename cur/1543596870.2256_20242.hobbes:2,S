another issue is that I don't see any value in defining the
unlock_buffer() with the get_bh/put_bh in it. The get_bh over there is
just useless because we don't have the memory barriers in the get_bh and
try_to_free_buffer paths, that's what party fooled me last night in
thinking we didn't need to get_bh in the implicit synchronization point
but that using unlock_buffer (with the get_bh in it was enough), otherwise
unlock_buffer would been pointless (and infact now it sorted out it is
as far I can tell ;).
So I'd kill unlock_buffer and replace it with __unlock_buffer.
