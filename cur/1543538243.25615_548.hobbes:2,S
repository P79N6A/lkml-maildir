I'm having an argument with someone over the correctness of
something they are doing on a linux firewall. They are capturing all
DNS forwarding requests and redirecting them to a local cache
only server that then responds to the original internal request.
Here is what the dump looks like from the requesting internal
linux workstation:
15:33:29.084642 0:90:27:ce:52:98 0:0:b4:92:32:e8 0800 
   88: 10.0.0.10.1435 > 194.46.0.60.53: 5219+ (46) (ttl 64, id 50750)
15:33:29.085633 0:0:b4:92:32:e8 0:90:27:ce:52:98 0800 
   145: 10.127.13.1.53 > 10.0.0.10.1435: 5219 NXDomain 
   q: home.netscape 0/1/0 (103) (ttl 64, id 2844)
15:33:29.085701 0:90:27:ce:52:98 0:0:b4:92:32:e8 0800 
   173: 10.0.0.10 > 10.127.13.1: 
   icmp: 10.0.0.10 udp port 1435 
   unreachable [tos 0xc0] (ttl 255, id 50751)
As you can see, the dns request goes out from port 1435 to
a real DNS server; but the reply comes back to that port  
from the cache serving on the firewall via it's internal
REDIRECT. The linux workstation then seems to reject it.
I can see some sense in this, ie the return IP is not
the same as the one on the request. This brings up two
questions.
1) Is this indeed the way the tcp stack is supposed to
   operate? Is it intentional security, accidental security
   or a bug? 
2) How do you convince some one they are doing the wrong thing? :-) 
The workstation that the dump comes from is a 2.2.14 with
international patches btw.
