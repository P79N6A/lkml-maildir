They're not freed, but I don't see that as a memory leak.  The page
tables stay there ready for the next time a vmalloc() needs to expand
into them.  Seems sensible to me: do you have an actual case where it
wastes significant memory?
(I haven't thought it through, but I would not be surprised if there
turned out to be awkward races if those page tables were freed when
emptied: the code's probably simpler and surer the way it is.)
