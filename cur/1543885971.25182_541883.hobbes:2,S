Right.

No I do not have any number beyond the efficiency calculations based on 
whole slabs. We would have to do some experiments to figure out how much 
space is actually wasted through partial slabs.
If you just do straight allocation on a UP system then there is at maximum 
one partial slab per slabcache with SLUB.
The situation becomes different with allocation and frees. Then we may 
have lots of partial slabs that we allocate from. But the SLOB approach 
also will have holes to manage. So I do not see how this could be a 
benefit unless you only have a few precious pages and you need to put 
multiple object sizes into it. A 4M system still has 1000 pages.
