That would involve fixing all of the flush_dcache_mmap_lock/unlock()
wrappers to take an extra flags variable (which would be unused on null
implementations) ... it can be done, but it's a lot of work; I think,
since all the current users aren't in atomic context, that we shouldn't
bother unless anyone can see a real need to call it from atomic context.
