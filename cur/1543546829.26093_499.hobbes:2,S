Hello!

Grrr... No doubts!
File is closed, when all the references from user disappear.
I have already tried to clean this issue times in the past.
File must have two refcounts: f_users and f_count.
f_users counts references from user i.e. from file descriptor
tables (and from a few of descriptor-less files inside kernel).
fget() and fput() work on f_count.
When f_users becomes zero, file is closed, but not destroyed.
Method fops->flush() is called to shutdown it. It wakes up
processes holding f_count on this file, particualry.
When f_count becomes zero, it is destroyed. Method fos->close()
is called before destruction.
