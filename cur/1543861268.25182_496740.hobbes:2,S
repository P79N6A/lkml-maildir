Hi all,
A comment in driver/rtc/hctosys says :
    /* IMPORTANT: the RTC only stores whole seconds. It is arbitrary
     * whether it stores the most close value or the value with partial
     * seconds truncated. However, it is important that we use it to store
     * the truncated value. This is because otherwise it is necessary,
     * in an rtc sync function, to read both xtime.tv_sec and
     * xtime.tv_nsec. On some processors (i.e. ARM), an atomic read
     * of >32bits is not possible. So storing the most close value would
     * slow down the sync API. So here we have the truncated value and
     * the best guess is to add 0.5s.
     */
I work with ST m41t81 rtc's.  Those rtc's actually have a 1/100th of second
register.  Should the generic rtc interface not support that ?
