Now, i figured out, there is a certain reasonable safety gap which works
for people, because the libraries depended on are well known.
What happens with AS randomisation, is that the variance is simply too
large. But what is more important, is that vendors do modifications
which change the amount of randomisation, which means that potentially
no MAP_FIXED is safe, generally.
Yes, there is uncertainty in both cases -- library variance or AS randomisation,
but the latter arguably crosses a practical manageability boundary.
