Hi,
Here are some i2c driver changes for 2.5.68.  These include a lot of
cleanup patches, removing dead or duplicated code.  With these patches,
we are almost able to remove i2c-sensor.h and i2c-sensor.c, but not
quite there.  Also a new i2c chip driver has been added.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
