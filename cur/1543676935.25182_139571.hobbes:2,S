Hi All,
Since a long time I asking me, which PC-Hardware is compatible with Alpha's? All? Is it just a question if the driver exists for this architecture?
I know that the Alpha's has the same buses and are also little Endian like Intel (right?).
So as example I could take an ATI Radeon or an Adaptec 29160 SCSI Controller, put it into an Alpha and it works?
Thank you!
Marc
