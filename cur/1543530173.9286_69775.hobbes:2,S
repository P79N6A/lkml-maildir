We are contractually prohibited by our agreements with MS from
performing any NTFS work on Linux.  Obviously, this does not prohibit us
from performing any NetWare, NDS, clustering, or any other types of
work, just NTFS work or any work that involves Microsoft technology
(except is the cause of helping MS customers who report problems between
Linux and W2K/NT interoperability on the kernel list or folks who
require help with NT drivers, tools, etc. -- I have provided help for
this in the past and will continue to).  
I would like to see the NTFS Linux driver stop corrupting folks data
under W2K and NT, which is in everyone's interests, including MS, but we
cannot provide any specific MS IP of any kind towards the NTFS effort on
Linux.  Despite what a lot of folks say to bad mouth Microsoft, they
have treated us extremely well as a partner (just like the Linux folks
have) and been helpful in our development projects.   
Steve has my email address, and is always free to dialogue, though I am
not certain how much help I can provide without going over the line.
