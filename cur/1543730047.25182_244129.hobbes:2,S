I just posted a similar trace of ~4141 usec from P6 here:
http://www.cybsft.com/testresults/2.6.8.1-P6/latency-trace1.txt
This was part of a run from yesterday evening. After just rebooting, I
too am seeing several of these. With the system not being hammered by
the stress tests though, the max is only up to ~103 usec. I will be
updating to P7 shortly.
