e100 and e1000 both query h/w for stats on a timer (2 seconds) and cache
the results.  A call into the driver's get_stats function just returns
these cached values.  With e100, there is a problem in that issuing the
command to dump stats doesn't return right away, so rather than blocking
in the driver by waiting for the command to complete, the driver just
reads the results of the dump command 2 seconds prior, and then reissues
a new dump command.  So e100 stats are delayed by ~2 seconds.
3c59x (and others) query the h/w for stats in the driver's get_stats
function directly.  This gives up-to-date stats.  We could do this with
e1000, but it'll take a little bit of surgery because there is some
other code in the driver that is dependent on stats collected over 2
second period.  Nothing that can't be fixed.
