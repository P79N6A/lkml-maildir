You're right. This excessively large calculation is left-over from a Magic
Bug That Wouldn't Go Away at the time. I thought I might be overflowing
the usemap (even though I couldn't be but I was desperate for explanations
at the time). The second calculation does not need "+ sizeof(unsigned
long)"
This wastes a few bytes but should not cause problems. I'll fix it and
release a version against -rc5 on Monday (The delay is because I don't
have access to a test environment right now)
