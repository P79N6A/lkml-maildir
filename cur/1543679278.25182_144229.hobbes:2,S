Guilty. The sad thing is that's just the tip of my politically
incorrect iceberg.
The nvidia driver (and the attempt at agpgart) is loaded when X
starts, long after the potential SATA related crash.  I changed my
default init level and rebooted a few times to verify the crash, so
I'm pretty sure that neither agpgart or the proprietary graphics driver
are involved in the problem.
