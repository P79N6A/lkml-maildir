 I'd add a comment to say that 0 enables the osc.

 I think it would be cleaner to define the routine as follow:
.. ds1672_get_control(...., unsigned char *status)
 and to usa the space provided by the caller to store the result.

please #define DS1672_REG_CONTROL_EOSC 0x80
and check the single bit.

 ditto.
 thanks for your work!
