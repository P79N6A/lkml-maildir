  Marcelo, what is required get the aic79xx driver, and the aic7xxx 
updates into 2.4.21?  A number of linux distros are already using it. 
 It would really help people using board with the U320.  
    I've been using both drivers for some time with no issues.  Or maybe 
you'd prefer Alan put it in his tree 1st?
