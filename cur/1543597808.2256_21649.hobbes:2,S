The original message talked about duplicating QEMM's MagnaRAM (a RAM
compression utility) under Linux, which seems to be part of what the page at
the URL describes. They say that they're not aiming for performance right now,
and I can believe that (their numbers are quite iffy).
They also do go over compressed swap, and after looking at point IV in section
4 of their design considerations, they seem to be headed in the right
direction.
I think maybe I'll go help...
