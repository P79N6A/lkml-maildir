That particular issue shouldn't be a problem, as SELinux security
transitions aren't controlled by Linux capabilities and SELinux
specifically controls code execution (both entry into a domain and
ability to execute anything else without changing domains).  However, I
do agree that it could yield an unexpected failure in the program that
would be harmful, so I'm in favor of checking the state only once.
