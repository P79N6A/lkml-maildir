There is a new io resource flag as part of the pci rom code,
IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW, that is used on x86. If IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW
is set, you should ignore the physical ROM and use the copy at C000:0.
Can we build an equivalent flag for PPC? On x86 arch specific code
determines the boot video device and sets the flag.
Acutally, if radeon and rage fb drivers were using the PCI ROM support
(drivers/pci/rom.c) would they be having this problem? The 55AA check
is in the PCI ROM support too.
