Data point:
I have a server and firewall using 2.4.19-pre2-ac4 with Linksys LNE100TX nic's
firewall is 6x86 on Intel 430VX uptime 146 days
server is PII on Intel 440BX uptime 83 days
both report the nic as:
Linksys Network Everywhere Fast Ethernet 10/100 model NC100 (rev 11)
both autonegotiate 100 full duplex with a Seimens 5 port 10/100 switch
Maybe Linksys used different chipsets in their LNE100TX, or some change
since 2.4.19-pre2-ac4 is a problem
