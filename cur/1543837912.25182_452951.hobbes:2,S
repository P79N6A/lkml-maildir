My scsi card stopped being detected in 2.6.18-rc3-mm2, but works in
plain 2.6.18-rc3.  I bisected all the way down to the git-sas.patch.  I
then noticed that if I enable the AIC94XX driver, my card works again.
I'm digging through it right now, but I figured I'd post in case anyone
else had seen this.  This error mode seems vaguely familiar as well.
Any ideas?
