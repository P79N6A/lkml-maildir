Ok, it isn't raid. It took a little more effort to reproduce with plain
/dev/hd[eg] read, but the md5sum mismatch eventually happaned.
This was with 2.2.20+IDE, no hpt patch. The drives were forced to UDMA33 as
opposed to (default) UDMA66. This time, nothing shows up in the log.
I'll try again with 2.2.18pre19 (this time harder) to make sure it really
_really_ doesn't happen with it.
Then I'll give 2.4.15 a shot to see if hpt behaves (2.4 lacks e2compr
however, so I'm not sure I can actually use it).
