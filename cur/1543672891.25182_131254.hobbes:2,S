Subject: [PATCH] Fix for vma merging refcounting bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When a new vma can be merged simultaneously with its two immediate
neighbours in both directions, vma_merge() extends the predecessor vma
and deletes the successor.  However, if the vma maps a file, it fails to
fput() when doing the delete, leaving the file's refcount inconsistent.
