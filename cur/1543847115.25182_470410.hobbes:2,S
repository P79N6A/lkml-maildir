We really need to figure out how to communicate that better.  I just
sent it to the maintainer (as listed in MODULE_AUTHOR).  Do we need a
MODULE_CHANGES_CC macro too?

Hmm.  Embarrassing.  Seems it's a stale prototype; I'll delete it.
OTOH, there is a pdc_init in avr32, and it's prudent to not have two
functions of the same name, so that you know which one is appearing in a
backtrace.  So it might be a good idea to apply this patch anyway.
