Subject: `filetype' ext2 feature causes dump to SEGV

(My apologies for sending this to the kernel list, but I do not know
which other would be more appropriate.)
We have upgraded to e2fsprogs-1.18 and dump-0.4b9 on our RedHat-6.1
machines (kernel 2.2.13).  On filesystems which we create with the
most recent mke2fs, dump is aborting with a SEGV.  This only happens
when the filesystem is already populated; empty or nearly-empty
filesystems do not cause the failure.
When we copy the files off, downgrade to e2fsprogs-1.15, re-run
mke2fs, and copy the files back, the problem goes away.  This behavior
is very reproducible.
Here is a backtrace of the failure.  (Incidentally, this was somewhat
annoying to come by; I had to comment out dump's catching of SEGV in
order to get a core dump.  Running dump directly under gdb does not
work because the crash happens in a forked subprocess.)
(gdb) where
#0  0x2ab30e96 in chunk_free (ar_ptr=0x2abc5040, p=0x808a480) at malloc.c:3033
#1  0x2ab30d75 in __libc_free (mem=0x808a488) at malloc.c:2959
#2  0x2aacaa40 in ext2fs_dir_iterate () from /lib/libext2fs.so.2
#3  0x8050683 in dumpdirino (dp=0x80558e0, ino=62977) at traverse.c:756
#4  0x804bb5e in main (argc=0, argv=0x80580ac) at main.c:574
I would guess there is a bug in ext2fs_dir_iterate, or in dump's
interaction with it, when the file system has the `filetype' feature
enabled.  This is the only difference I can discern between
filesystems created by the old mke2fs and the new.
This is quite easy to reproduce, but I would be glad to provide more
information if it would be useful.
