Assuming there is no
	4. a solution that works
(and I do not assume that) we can just not do inheritance under
reader-writer locks and that means they remain as spin locks.  Normal
spin locks remain proper candidates.
I never mentioned anything about reader-writer locks in my original
email.  Most of the long-held locks I am considering are not in this
category anyway ...

P.S. If this is going to turn into another priority-inheritance flame, I
am stopping here.  Let's take it off-list or just drop it, please.  I'd
much prefer to discuss the current combilock issue which is at hand. ;)
