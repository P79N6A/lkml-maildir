I commented previously about the preemption allowing the kernel to keep 
more resources busy.  So if you have 6 disk controllers and 4 NICs, the 
preemption can allow the kernel to keep more of them busier at the same 
time, while without preemption, one resource might get starved while 
non-preemptable code is servicing another.
This makes the overhead very much worth it.
Are there test results which demonstrate that this theory doesn't apply 
practically to real-world server loads?
I would expect a very busy server to be helped by this in a noticable 
way, but then I am often short-sighted.  :)
