I never said it was deadly broken, just that it wasn't correct (fact)
and probably shouldn't have been accepted at this point of the release
cycle (opinion).
Using an experimental ID is certainly bad and fixing it is welcome, but
this isn't causing any immediate bug as far as I can see. You don't even
use the ID anywhere at the moment.
My point is that defining a new ID just before 2.6.15 when we know
we'll change it right after 2.6.15 is a bad engineering practice. More
importantly, I am asking what the point is of publishing patches for
review before they get integrated if they'll be integrated regardless
of objections. If we can't deal with that kind of situation, our
development process probably needs to be improved - even if in this
one case the harm done is admittedly neglectable.
I'll go undefine these experimental IDs soon anyway, as the concept is
broken IMHO. If driver authors don't use the ID, they can set it to 0.
If they do use it, they better register it soon so as to avoid
collisions with other drivers which haven't been merged either.
Thanks,
