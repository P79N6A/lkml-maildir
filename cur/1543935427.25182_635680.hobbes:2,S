Yes that should be default, unfortunately it is not. It's one 
of the first things I do on new machines.

fsck is actually seek bound, most likely it won't make much difference
for fsck. Seeky disk IO is always slow on a spinning disk.
There's actually been a patchkit recently to make fsck much faster
by clustering metadata better so it can be reached with less seeks,
but that hasn't reached mainline yet and and will unfortunately
require freshly created file systems.
