For me low memory conditions are node or zone specific and may be 
particular to certain allocation constraints. For some reason you have 
this simplified global picture in mind.
The other statement is weird. It is bad to fail allocation attempts, they 
may lead to a process being terminated. Memory should be reclaimed 
earlier to avoid these situations.
