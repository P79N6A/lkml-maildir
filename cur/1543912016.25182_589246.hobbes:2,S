Yes. do_wait(WCONTINUED) can miss SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED task if the task
dequeues another sig_kernel_stop() signal. I thought this is harmless, but
it turns out I misunderstood the needed semantics.
Thanks for your explanation.
This is easy to fix, but we have to split SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED into 2 flags,
one for do_wait(), another to indicate that do_signal_stop() should abort.

Yes. But please look at the pseudo code above. do_signal_stop() checks
"flags & (SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED | SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT)" to prevent exactly
this race. Actually we need this check even if we don't temporary drop
->siglock, we shouldn't rely on the fact that SIGKILL < SIGSTOP and so
it will be dequeued first.
But, as you pointed out, this breaks do_wait(WCONTINUED), and the fix
needs another flag, so please forget.
However, is it all correct currently ? Consider 2 threads, T1 and T2,
SIGTTIN is SIG_DFL, SIGTTOU has a handler.
	T1 does get_signal_to_deliver(), dequeus SIGTTIN, unlocks ->siglock.
	SIGCONT comes in, nothing to do yet, just clear SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED.
	SIGTTOU is sent, T2 dequeues it and sets SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED again.
	It has a handler, we shouldn't stop, but
	T1 continues, takes ->siglock, and calls do_signal_stop().
What do you think about something like the patch below? It moves the setting of
SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED from dequeue_signal() to get_signal_to_deliver(), and the
flag is set only if the sig_kernel_stop() signal doesn't have a handler.
