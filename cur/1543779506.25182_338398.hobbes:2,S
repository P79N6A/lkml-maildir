yeah I know that was redundant (after putting it in), but I wanted to
make sure what current was. The locks held wasn't as straight forward as
to what was current (I wasn't looking at what produced that, I just
noticed the output).

I thought about changing that too. But I'm assuming that you are looking
for bugs (like the kjournald as RT) where a task may be in a loop, but
higher priority tasks can still preempt it.  Putting the check elsewhere
will still be screwed up by preempting higher prio tasks.
In my custom kernel, I have a wchan field of the task that records where
the task calls something that might schedule. This way I can see where
things locked up if I don't have a back trace of the task.  This field
is always zero when it switches to usermode.  Something like this can
also be used to check how long the process is in kernel mode.  If a task
is in the kernel for more than 10 seconds without sleeping, that would
definitely be a good indication of something wrong.  I probably could
write something to check for this if people are interested.  I wont
waste my time if nobody would want it.
