For anyone looking for the OCF port for linux,  you can find the latest
release here:
	
http://lists.logix.cz/pipermail/cryptoapi/2004/000261.html
One of the drivers uses the existing kernel crypto API to implement
a SW crypto engine for OCF.
As for permission to use a dual license,  I will gladly approach the
authors if others feel it is important to know the possibility of it at this
point,
Cheers,
Davidm
