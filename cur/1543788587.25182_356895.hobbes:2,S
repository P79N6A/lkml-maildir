Miklos Szeredi put these lines there with the following comment:
"[PATCH] pivot_root() circular reference fix
Fix 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4857
When pivot_root is called from an init script in an initramfs 
environment, it causes a circular reference in the mount tree.
The cause of this is that pivot_root() is not prepared to handle 
pivoting an unattached mount. In an initramfs environment, rootfs is the 
root of the namespace, and so it is not attached.
This patch fixes this and related problems, by returning -EINVAL if 
either the current root or the new root is detached."

googeling a little bit I found the following link:
