Hmm, there was a patch from PJ for that at some point. Not sure why it 
was not merged. iirc the first implementation was too complex, but
there was a second reasonable one.

set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
Some policies can be even set without that.
There are already kernel users BTW that prove you wrong.

Agreed that should be cleaned up.

Should be easy to fix if someone is motivated.  When I wrote the code
nodemask_t didn't exist yet, and when it was merged it wasn't 
converted over. Not a big deal.

You lost me here.

Does it really? So far my feedback from all users I talked to is that they only
use a small subset of the functionality, even what is there is too complex.
Nobody with a real app so far has asked me for page migration.
There was one implementation of simple page migration in Steve L.'s patches,
but that was just because it was too hard to handle one corner case
otherwise.
