Well, sending SCSI patches to the kernel mailing list but not to
linux-scsi is usually a good enough reason.

This patch is too simplistic.  ide-cd.c:ide_cdrom_drive_status() looks
to be a reasonable implementation.  However, the worry is that
GET_EVENT_NOTIFICATION is a MMC command; devices not conforming to MMC
won't support it.  In theory, they should just return ILLEGAL_REQUEST,
but USB devices have been known to crash when given commands they don't
understand.  How widely tested has this been (if it's been in Gentoo
since 2004, then it's probably widely tested enough)?
