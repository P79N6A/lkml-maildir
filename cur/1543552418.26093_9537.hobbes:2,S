Just FYI - I was able to reproduce it with 2.4.0-test5 and all laters
(different pre-s of test6/7/8/9/10) I have. I was not able to reproduce 
it with 2.2.17-pre13 (although this kernel had really bad behavior when
I run out of space with backing file - sendmail suspended itself due
to load of 37... on machine which has usually load 0.01). 
I do not have kernels between 2.2.17 and 2.4.0-test5 installed.
If you have anything I should check...
