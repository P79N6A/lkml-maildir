	I'm the one that Sean is refering to and I'd just like to
add some information I've noticed.
	If I turn the volume all the way up I can faintly hear the
music playing, like I was hearing it because of crosstalk on the chip.
At first I thought it was just my wishful thinking playing tricks
on me but it is definetly there :). Now it appears if I adjust the
PCM volume it controls this faint whisper but controling the main volume
does nothing. 
	Also, I no longer see the timeouts on the AC97 codec with the
newer kernels. The ID for the codec is 0x41445361 (AD1886 according to alsa 
drivers). This codec is not currently recognized by the kernel's ac97_codec 
drivers.
	I'm also willing to try any kernel tweaking/patches, and gather
more debug info if need be.
