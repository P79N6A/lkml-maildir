On the kernel side I still plan to use pages, though my ideal case
would be to allocate one great big slab of non-conflicting memory, and
just copy everything to where it needs to go.
On the user space side what I am proposing actually increases the
granularity quite a bit.  For a linux kernel with a ramdisk you should
only need to pass the kernel 3 segments.  (Assuming everything is
contiguous in user space memory).  The setup code, the kernel, and the
ramdisk.

Perhaps.  So far I don't need an array that is O(N) in the size of
memory just O(N) in the size of the image I am copying.   The
permutations that are necessary to avoid conflicts in the pathological
cases are a pain.  But I've already done that...
Anyway now it's back to the trenches...
