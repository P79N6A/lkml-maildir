Quick question,
Has anyone had any experiance with the drivers for the dpt smartraid V 
series of controller. My company is interested in a raid 5 system in 
hardware and the smartraid 5 seems to be very cost effective BUT it also 
seems to have only one driver that has been developed by the company 
and NOT incorperated into the kernel yet.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Matt Berglund
