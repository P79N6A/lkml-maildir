Make note that a lot of the more intrusive patches will be deferred to 2.6.1,
which will have a patch easily 10x the size of the -test[789] ones (Linus
is being intentionally very picky about what goes into the tree).  I'm
going to predict that the 2.6.0->2.6.1 patch will be well over a megabyte
even after gzipping.
