Because I have an iBook I dual boot, and I wanted access to my reiserfs
file systems while using OSX. I'd call it more of a write-from-scratch
than a port, actually.

That's great, except that by and large, the Linux VFS covers all the
common cases for you. This is such a ridiculous corner case that it
hardly justifies using the BSD namei() semantics.

Yes, it is a quick hack. It's called being practical and consistent
until we can get around to removing slashes. Slashes *were* ok in block
device names until we started using them as path name components.
I've stated the reasons why adding a subdirectory is a bad idea multiple
times. The fix is already accepted. I'm done discussing this.
