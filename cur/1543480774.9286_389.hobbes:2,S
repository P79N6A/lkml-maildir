Looking good.  Suggestion:  I was always taught to type two spaces after a
full stop, and find it looks less cluttered that way (it helps your eye
break the text into sentences).   There is also one place where there is no
space at all ('supported.Support').
Also I didn't think Euro support was a kernel issue - isn't it an
X11/console font issue?
