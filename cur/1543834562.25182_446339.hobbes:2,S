Hopefully, nothing but it may be necessary to modify the plugsched 
interface if dynsched can't be implemented against it "as is".  E.g. 
both staircase and nicksched needed changes to what was required for 
ingosched and the SPA schedulers.

It's probably not a good idea to have different schedulers managing the 
same resource.  The way to do different scheduling per process is to use 
the scheduling policy mechanism i.e. SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, etc. 
(possibly extended) within each scheduler.  On the other hand, on an SMP 
system, having a different scheduler on each run queue (or sub set of 
queues) might be interesting :-).  The schedulers would probably have to 
have a common idea of how the run queue works though and this would 
restrict the choice of schedulers.
I have no intentions (at the moment) of going down this path myself.
However, I am thinking about making it possible to switch between the 
various SPA schedulers on a running system.  A extension to this could 
be to attempt automatic selection of which scheduler to use possibly 
based on which users are logged in.
