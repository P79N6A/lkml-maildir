Indeed this is a weird case that we have not encountered but it does make
the point that the driver knows best what to do.

agreed. The reaction should be left to the driver's policy.

For 2.4, unfortunately there was no other way to pass that feedback
without the driver sending a packet up the stack. Our system feedback
probe is based on sampling the backlog queue.

violent agreement.
