OTOH, if we were worried about confusing people, we wouldn't be
using the acronym 'rc' for our 'Ridiculous Count', and have our rc1
denote the result of 2 weeks of stuffing the tree with new features
and intrusive changes, where people might mistake that for the much
more common RC-as-in-'Release Candidate'. :)
Our -rc is what everyone else knows as -pre, and our dot zeros
basically correspond to what people think of as a release candidate.
As a developer it doesn't hurt me and I do like the current system,
but in principle I just dislike things that are more confusing than
they could be.
