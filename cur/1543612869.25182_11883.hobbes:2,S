Try 250 apache server processes running a mix of mod_perl and static
content, you'll see quite a reasonable queue size then, and it isnt all
cpu hogs.
Interesting question however. I certainly can't disprove your belief that
the queue will be short enough to be worth using multiqueue for the case
where its a queue per processor.
