That's more or less what it does (see below). The problem is, what do you
mean by "free" memory? -- there are several ways to measure this, none of
which are all that useful.

I'm not looking at the kernel source (big mistake in this mailing list, I
know...), I'm looking at it from an app developer's point of view. From my
experiments, it seems that with /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory=0, malloc()
will succeed so long as you ask for less than the total RAM+swap on the
machine. If overcommit_memory=1 anything goes.
