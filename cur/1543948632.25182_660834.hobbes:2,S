In the process of debugging this issue, i found hardware sometimes
entered another wrong stat.
 nv_adma_interrupt: adma status 0x1540 notifier 0xffffffff notifer_err
0x0 sactive 0x1.
As the status has no NV_ADMA_STAT_CPBERR, the check_commands =
0xffffffff.
Actually,  there is only one command(sactive 0x1).
