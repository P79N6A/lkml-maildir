Yes, it should work (the message is just there so anything opening the MFT 
is reported. this probably shouldn't result in a message but can stay for 
the moment). - NTFS design goal is, I believe, that you can mount a newer 
NTFS partition using a driver implementing an older NTFS version both for 
reading and writting without destroying anything. - Obviously this requires 
some kind of safe-guard to stop fs corruption... (more about this at a 
later point in time)
Regarding updates: according to the MS book: Inside Windows NT (2nd Ed) by 
David Solomon and the Macmillan book Win NT/2000 Native API Reference by 
Gary Nebbett, Win2k NTFS (v3.0) has several updates including:
         - security descriptors are stored in a central file and referenced 
by each file record (rather then kept in the file records themselves). This 
also leads to a discontinuation of the attribute security descriptor that 
used to be present in all files (accorind to Gary Nebbett anyway).
         - improved sparse files support (no physical space allocated at 
all anymore?)
         - indexing of more attributes rather than just filename attribute
         - new attributes / redefinition of old unused attributes such as:
                 - unique object ID (used to be the volume_version)
                 - reparse point (now used for example for symbolic links 
and mount points)
                 - property set (re-removed in NTFS 3.0 beta testing?)
                 - logged utility stream (e.g. used for Encrypted File 
System and can be used by user installable drivers for loggin purposes)
         - new MFT special file (actually a directory): $Extend. Holds 
(semi-)special NTFS v3.0 files, including: $ObjId, $Quota, $Reparse and 
$UsnJrnl
         - quota support
I.e. There are quite a few changes in (or rather extensions to) on-disk 
structures to implement these things!
