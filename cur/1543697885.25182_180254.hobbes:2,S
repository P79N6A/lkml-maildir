It's funny you mention random userland SIGSEGV's.
I don't know if this some of the fallout wrt CONFIG_PREEMPT being 
enabled or not but using vmware and running my ncurses mp3 player seems 
to trigger an oddity:
Apon using vmware, it may sometimes crap out with a internal bug # and 
in doing so, sometimes my mp3 player will segfault for no reason. This 
randomly happens. I do have preempt enabled. Even more odd is the fact 
that even if I have only say 4500K left out of 576MB, there is 0 swap 
usage. The kernel malloc fails if there is no physical memory? If I have 
a huge swap file/disk wouldn't it malloc some of that virtual memory? 
There is no OOM kill either happening since there's no log of that from 
the kernel saying it did an OOM kill.
I would certainly like to debug any weird oddities. My systems seem to 
be good test grounds for such things :-)
