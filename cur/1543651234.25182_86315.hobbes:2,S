	Hello,
I have recently compiled kernel 2.5.44. 
First thing I've spotted is that under fbconsole
mcedit doesn't show cursor, which is pretty
inconvenient. I have Geforce2 MX400.
Second one is that when I modprobed sound card
(snd-via82xx) which uses irq 12 all was OK,
but then I tried to access modem (on ttyS2)
also via irq 12 the system hanged instantly.
Last question follows: Is Nvidia planning to 
relase drivers for kernel v2.5??
