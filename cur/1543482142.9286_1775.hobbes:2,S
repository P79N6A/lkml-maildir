The acronym goes in parentheses at FIRST USE.  Thereafter you can use
the acronym instead of the long stuff.  If you're not going to use the
acronym again, you have no excuse for introducing it.
Unless, that is, the acronym is better known than the long form! That can
happen. DNA, for example. If you truly think so, just use the acronym.
