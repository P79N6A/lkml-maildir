What I have never gotten, is why on my machines (no specific distro, just
everything built from source and installed by me) login takes a long time,
unless I have portmap running.
My /etc/nsswitch.conf would seem to be right:
passwd:         files
group:          files
shadow:         files
hosts:          files dns
networks:       files dns
protocols:      files
services:       files
ethers:         files
rpc:            files
netgroup:       files
What else could effect that?
