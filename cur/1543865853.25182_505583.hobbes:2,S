Yes, stolen time happens in most moderns systems as a result of power 
management (and you can probably count SMM cycles as stolen if only 
there was a way to count them).  It would be useful to report on a 
laptop, for instance, how many cycles have been stolen by running off 
battery or on a server because of heat issues.  Having an interface for 
Linux to report this seems useful.  It is a covert channel, however, in 
a virtualized environment, so there should be some provision in the 
hypervisor to turn it off.
