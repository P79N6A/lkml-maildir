actually, one of the folks on the KJ list found this:
  
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9605/1957.html
which speaks thusly:
...
-#if __GNUC__ < 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 5)
-# define NORET_TYPE __volatile__
-# define ATTRIB_NORET /**/
-# define NORET_AND /**/
-#else
# define NORET_TYPE /**/
# define ATTRIB_NORET __attribute__((noreturn))
# define NORET_AND noreturn,
-#endif
...
  so it looks like a thoroughly obsolete macro which can be tossed.
i'll make the patch and test it.
