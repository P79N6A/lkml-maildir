Ok, this is just too wierd....
In logs the following....
request_module[scsi_hostadaptor]: Root fs not mounted
last message repeated 3 times
modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module eth1
insmod: /lib/modules/2.4.18/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_nat.o: insmod
iptable_nat failed
Ok, so why are these strange.  First of all, there is nothing remotely scsi in
this box.  Also, eth1 driver is compiled into the kernel.  Masq was working
fine, so the last message isn't important, except that it was trying to load a
module from 2.4.18 on a 2.5 box?
