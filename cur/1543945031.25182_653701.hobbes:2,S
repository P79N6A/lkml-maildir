One idea that I thought about when debating rebase vs. merge (and it's
far far from being fully baked) is versioned commits.  The gist of it
is that patches are assigned an hash identifier like today when they are
first committed into the tree, but, and this is the main change: if they mutate,
e.g. by a rebase, or even git commit --amend, their version is bumped up rather
than SHA changed.
This way all versions of the commit would be accessible and addressable using
their respective SHA *and* version. I think that this can help keep
the tree's history in a more intuitive way (since the patches' base identifier
won't change, just its version number), and you get a bonus of seeing each
commit's history, who changed it, and what was the change.
