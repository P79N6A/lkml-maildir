If if were actually talking about complex filesystem I'd agree.  But
the cramfs xip patch posted here touches about 2/3 of the number of
lines that cramfs has in total.  And cramfs is not exactly the best
base to start with..

With the filemap_xip.c helpers adding xip support to any filesystem
is pretty trivial for the highlevel filesystem operations.  The only
interesting bit is the lowlevel code (the get_xip_page method and
the others Carsten mentioned), but we need to do these lowlevel
code in a generic and proper way anyway.
I'll try to hack up an xip prototype for jffs2 next week.
