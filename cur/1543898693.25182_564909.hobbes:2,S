I think that I added flush_icache_page() to the place where any flush_(i)cache_xxx
is not called and lazy_mmu_prot_update was used instead of them.
But I want good review, of course.

Ah, yes...in do_anonymous_page(). my mistake.

(I'm sorry if I misses point.)
ia64's D-cache is coherent but I-cache and D-cache is not coherent and any
invalidation against d-cache will invalidate I-cache.
In my understanding :
PG_arch_1 is used for showing "there is no inconsistent data on any level of
cache". PG_uptodate is used for showing "this page includes the newest data
and contents are valid."
...maybe not used for the same purpose.
BTW, a page filled by DMA should have PG_arch_1 :(
