Hmm...

How about something really grungy like:
#define cpu_isset(cpu, cpumask)				\
	({ __typeof__(cpumask) __cpumask;		\
	   (void)(&__cpumask) == (cpumask_t *)0);	\
	   test_bit((cpu), (cpumask).bits); })

We've discussed this before when talking about whether it'd be easier to
just make people use raw bitop functions directly, so I know we have
philosophical differences here.
So, opinion alert: if I were doing this, I'd probably live without this
macro; in my mind it crosses the "too much abstraction" line.  I did
momentarily wonder what this macro did when I saw it used in the
succeeding patches.
But it's a minor nit; thanks for doing these.
Rusty.
