Take my advice: Don't waste time with 7.3 based setup. Simply take a 8.2. It is
way better. Applications should not have problems with such an upgrade.

Your problem is this: even your old 7.3 should not crash no matter what cron
does around midnight. It makes no sense to find out _what_ crashes the box, you
won't probably find the real cause, so in the end you are only taking a
work-around instead of a real solution.
On the other hand: if you take a state-of-the-art distro chances are you won't
see your problem any more, have spent about the same time, but come out with a
new and fine solution.

Stephan
