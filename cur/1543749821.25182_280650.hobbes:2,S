Hmm, it seems you are right. I forgot about reordering issues. I relied on
op being atomic, but if it points at an uninitialized shim, this will end
badly. How about this?
                memcpy(&mbus->shim_ops, ubus->op, sizeof(struct usb_operations));
                mbus->shim_ops.submit_urb = mon_submit;
                mbus->saved_op = ubus->op;
                smp_mb();       /* ubus->op is not protected by spinlocks */
                ubus->op = &mbus->shim_ops;
                ubus->monitored = 1;
Generally, the type of coding which requires a use of memory barriers in drivers
is a bug or a latent bug, so I am sorry for the above. It was a sacrifice to
make usbmon invisible if it's not actively monitoring. Sorry about that.
