YES: making the IRQ-masked spinlocks interruptible we are more likely to
interrupt a deadlock via SysRQ _even_ with the NMI applyed.
If my above sentence is wrong please explain me why.
I sure agree that it's not a good thing w.r.t. debugging to avoid
triggering the NMI oops as we won't get the whole stack trace from the
user with the SYSRQ+P way.
