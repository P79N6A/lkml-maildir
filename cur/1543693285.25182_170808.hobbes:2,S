 That means standard ISA FDCs, if present, will be just there, not
elsewhere.  This is needed for the MB BIOS to recognize the controllers,
but an add-on card with its own BIOS is free to use other addresses as
long as it appropriately hooks the BIOS int 0x13 chain.

 You disable the port addresses for floppies either with the PC/XT
configuration switches or with appropriate settings in the BBU RAM area of
the RTC chip for PC/AT.  Compatibility is preserved by only using BIOS
calls and predefined variables.  This is especially needed for controllers
with own BIOSes.

 That's no problem -- when you have standard ISA FDC devices to be handled
by the system BIOS, you have to put them at the predefined addresses.  Of
course these need not be the so called "super I/O" chips -- they may well
be the original NEC uPD765 ones or compatible substitutes.

 You need to query the BIOS if standard ISA floppy drives are supported,
either via a call or checking the BIOS variable area.  If there is no
floppy drive at the expected address, you can only assume exactly that and
not that there's nothing decoding these addresses at all.
