There's no other change.
If you agree, Jeff might be able to do the
  mv drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap.c \
    drivers/net/wireless/hostap/hostap_main.c
plus applying the patch below.

AFAIK you can't build a module hostap.o consisting of multiple objects 
with the source files of one of them named hostap.c (Sam Cc'ed for this).

I wanted to remove the #include "hostap_ioctl.c" from hostap.c and build 
hostap_ioctl.c separately, but this doesn't work since hostap.c has the 
same name as the module.
After renaming hostap.c this will be possible.
