I see, it would probably be too painful in this context, that's pity.

Well actually it seems already supported. Some files in arch/sh
are already touched by RT patches.
I took a look to your interesting paper and I have now a question
about the BKL: Why is it so hard to get ride of it completely ?
Do you have any advices or starting point to get involved in RT kernel ?
I'm almost new in this area but I'd like to acquire some knowledges and
try to contribute if possible...
Thanks !
