Subject: [KBD] Fix dollar key on swiss french USB keyboards

Salut,
On a swiss french keyboard, the dollar key, which worked well in Linux
2.4, now  changes the terminal to the  last used one. This  is not the
purpose of a dollar key. As the "}" character is on the same key, it's
quite a problem for developers to have this bug.
This is  a hack and may screw  up any other keyboard  tables!  I'm not
sure how to implement it cleanly.  I'd be glad to hear of testers with
US-english and other keyboards.
