Hi,
I have a scsi disk on Adaptec ASC-29320 U320. I have created a linux
partition and ext3 filesystem over it.
Now the problem is, whenever the machine is rebooted, the partition
information to the OS is lost and I get an error saying it as a not valid
block device.
But fdisk tool shows the partitions, but "cat /proc/partitions" doesnt have
this. I need to do a "partprobe" and then have to mount it explicitly.
What could be causing this problem. Given below are some of the command
outputs.
# uname -a

# mount /dev/sda1 /disk1
