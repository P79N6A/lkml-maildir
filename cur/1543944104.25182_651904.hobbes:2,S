Thanks for sending the dumps Carlos.
The patch below (on top of rc1) should fix the problem. Can you please
check it.
Thanks,
Venki
Earlier patch (bc71bec91f9875ef825d12104acf3bf4ca215fa4) broke
suspend resume on many laptops. The problem was reported by
Carlos R. Mafra and Calvin Walton, who bisected the issue to above patch.
The problem was because, C2 and C3 code were calling acpi_idle_enter_c1
directly, with C2 or C3 as state parameter, while suspend/resume was in
progress. The patch bc71bec started making use of that state information,
assuming that it would always be referring to C1 state. This caused the
problem with suspend-resume as we ended up using C2/C3 state indirectly.
Fix this by adding acpi_idle_suspend check in enter_c1.
