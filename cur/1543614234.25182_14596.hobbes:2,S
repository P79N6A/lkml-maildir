Subject: Undefined symbol in nfsd.o kernel 2.4.17

I am getting an undefined symbol in nfsd.o in kernel 2.4.17.  The message
is "/lib/modules/2.4.17/kernel/fs/nfsd/nfsd.o: unresolved symbol
nfsd_linkage".  Nfsd works fine when linked into the kernel.
Here's the NFS related section of my config:
CONFIG_NFS_FS=m
CONFIG_NFS_V3=y
# CONFIG_ROOT_NFS is not set
CONFIG_NFSD=m
CONFIG_NFSD_V3=y
CONFIG_SUNRPC=m
CONFIG_LOCKD=m
CONFIG_LOCKD_V4=y
I was able to make it work by changing "EXPORT_SYMBOL(nfsd_linkage);" in
fs/filesystems.c to "EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS(nfsd_linkage);".  Not sure if
that's the proper way to go about it, but it works :)
Please cc me on replies to this, because I haven't subscribed to the list.
Thanks,
