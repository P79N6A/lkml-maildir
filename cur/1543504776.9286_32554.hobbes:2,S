OTOH, it is even more ridiculous to not maintain the man page for
"cp".

There are some MAJOR problems with info, however; one of them being
the requirement of a system-wide index, which usually doesn't work too
well at all.  man pages get installed and they are immediately
recognizable.
Furthermore, there is the complete lack of even optional formatting
hints in the browsable form; although you can generate formatting from
TeX the result lacks all the references.  If there was a dvi browser
which would preserve the hyperlinks, that would perhaps be another
issue; perhaps someone ought to make a decent way for TeX to output
PDF...
Grepping through HTML *source* may suck (as would grepping through
TeXinfo source or troff source) but HTML can be converted to ASCII
text; in fact, "lynx -dump" does a pretty good job with it (I wish
there was a half-decent command-line HTML to PS converter, too.)
