I think your proposal is a good (maybe even excellent) one, but it
somewhat sidesteps the issue (which may be the best thing to
do). Rather than answering the question "how best to allow regular
users access to SCHED_FIFO", it says "lets offer regular users
SCHED_ISO which is essentially identical to SCHED_FIFO unless tasks
running SCHED_ISO use too much cpu time".
its a fine answer, but its the answer to a slightly different
question. if anyone (maybe us audio freaks, maybe someone else) comes
up with a reason to want "The Real SCHED_FIFO", the original question
will have gone unanswered.
