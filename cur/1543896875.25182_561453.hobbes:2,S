Thanks, I might if I have to courage to patch and compile my own kernel :)
However, I'd also need to change all my applications to set them with the 
right priority to see the good results, so I think I might just wait until it 
lands in mainline.
Just to check if I understood everything correctly:
The mainline scheduler tries to be smart and guess the priority of each task, 
and while it mostly hits the nail right in the head, sometimes it hits you 
right in the thumb.
Fair schedulers, on the contrary, forget about trying to be smart and just 
care about being fair, leaving the priority settings to where they belong: 
applications.
Is this more or less correct?
Alberto.
