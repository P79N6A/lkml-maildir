No, changing it for the high_loaded case was intentional, but
removing the assignment in the declaration leaves it uninitialized
for the case
if (free_mem_ptr < 0x100000) setup_normal_output_buffer();
So when I boot a zImage it contains 0, and the first time the
decompression needs to allocate new memory malloc() will say
there's none left - boom.

Yes, but initializing it for the "normal" case wouldn't hurt,
would it... ?
