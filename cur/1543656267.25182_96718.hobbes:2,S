Okay.  Thanks.

The hwfixes for .48 applied cleanly for me, so I tossed the patches into
OSDL's PLM hopper:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1043
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1042
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1041
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1038
Legend for those that don't want to click on the URLs:
a) PLM ID #1043: changes CONFIG_KEXEC to y by default (a quirk of the
PLM infrastructure).
b) PLM ID #1042: .48 hwfixes for kexec
c) PLM ID #1041: base kexec for 2.5.52
d) PLM ID #1038: base 2.5.52 kernel
e) OSDL PLM:
