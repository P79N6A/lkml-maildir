The working board has a different version of the Marvell chip:
$ grep Marvell working-MB 
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 14)
$ grep Marvell broken-MB 
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 12)
Not sure if that completely explains the problem because the broken chip on my
system is:
06:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 14)
I don't know what the differences are between versions.
