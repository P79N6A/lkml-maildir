Eh, mine is getting one attached to it right now.  It's getting more
popular, and it would be more popular yet if it weren't considered some
dirty little secret, or somehow unmanly.
Let's try a different show of hands: How many users would be happier if
they knew that kernel developers are using modern techniques to improve
the quality of the kernel?
Of course, I use the term "modern" here loosely, since kdb and kgdb are
really only 80's technology.  Without them, we're stuck in the 60's.
