Subject: [PATCH 1/5] readahead: no RA_FLAG_EOF on single page file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/9/35

Dot not set RA_FLAG_EOF on single page files.
readahead_close() will be called if RA_FLAG_EOF is there on file close.
It detects readahead hit/miss, and adjust ra_expected_bytes correspondingly.
Single page files are uninteresting for it. Since near 40% desktop
files are <= 4k, this patch can reduce many useless readahead_close()
invocations.
