Tigran,
One other area whee Linux could get into trouble.  Unixware does not
implement a spin_lock reader/writer lock nor does it implement spin_lock
style barrier synch object (from UI).  Some of their kernel apps will
barf if they use the reader/writer locks in Linux.  Their kernel cannot
support cases where spin_lock() style reader/writer locks are used.  
They also implemet priority inheritance for sleep locks as an SMP
optimization.  Linux appears to use priority inversion (Linus is this
correct).  Priority inheritence is a good feature for SMP scaling.  They
also implement a ticket scheme for sleep locks that are taken in a lock
ordering model, so if you deadlock, they have very good mechanisms for
detecting this.  Something Linux could use ....
