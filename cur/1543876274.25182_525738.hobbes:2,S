As I see it, the lock protects the ticks and the timer structure, and the 
wait queue *happen* to have a lock inside. That's the whole purpose in 
having data modeled by structures with accessor functions.
IMO, given that we'd get by plugging into the wait_queue_head_t lock is 
not much (if at all), it'd be better to to peek at the wait_queue_head_t 
directly.

Okie, I added a comment ;)

I agree. I thought we were talking about the "poor smuck" having to 
document it, and the patch header is a pretty good start (and maybe 
finish ;).
