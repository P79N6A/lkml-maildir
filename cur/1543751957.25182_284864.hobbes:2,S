The agp_in_use field of the bridge structure is never initialized.
That's the reason why atomic_read fails to read 0.
In vanilla, the bridge is allocated as a static global variable, and
thus initialized to 0 at init. In -mm, the bridge is kmalloc'ed, and
thus not initialized.
The attached patch fixes it and solves my problem (when combined with
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/7/377
). DRM is back with good performance.
