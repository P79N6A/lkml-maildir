   a debugging option; you probably do not want to set it unless you
   are an S390 port maintainer.
 
+CONFIG_PFAULT
+  Select this option, if you want to use PFAULT pseudo page fault
+  handling under VM. If running native or in LPAR, this option
+  has no effect. If your VM does not support PFAULT, PAGEEX 
+  pseudo page fault handling will be used.
+  Note that VM 4.2 supports PFAULT but has a bug in its 
+  implementation that causes some problems.
+  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM != VM4.2 should select
+  this option.
+
+CONFIG_SHARED_KERNEL
+  Select this option, if you want to share the text segment of the
+  Linux kernel between different VM guests. This reduces memory
+  usage with lots of guests but greatly increases kernel size.
+  You should only select this option if you know what you are
+  doing and want to exploit this feature.
