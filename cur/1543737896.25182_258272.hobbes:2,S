Let's try it again, by email this time.
Fundamentally, there is a huge impedence mismatch between how the ACPI
interpreter wants to access PCI configuration space, and how Linux wants
to access PCI configuration space.  Linux always has at least a pci_bus
around, if not a pci_dev.  So we can use dev->bus->ops to abstract the
architecture-specific implementation of "how do I get to configuration
space for this bus?"
ACPI doesn't have a pci_bus.  It just passes around a struct of { domain,
bus, dev, function } and expects the OS-specific code to determine what
to do with it.  The original hacky code constructed a fake pci_dev on the
stack and called the regular methods.  This broke ia64 because we needed
something else to be valid (I forget what), so as part of the grand "get
ia64 fully merged upstream" effort, I redesigned the OS-specific code.
Fortunately, neither i386 nor ia64 actually need the feature Linux has
to have a per-bus pci_ops -- it's always the same.  I think powerpc is
the only architecture that needs it.  So I introduced a pci_raw_ops that
both ACPI and a generic pci_root_ops could call.
The part I didn't seem to be able to get across to you yesterday was
that pci_root_ops is not just used for the PCI root bridge, it's used
for accessing every PCI device underneath that root bridge.
