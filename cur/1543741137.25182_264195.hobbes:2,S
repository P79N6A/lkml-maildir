Ok, after -Wbitwise for sparse, strict typechecking seems to
work. Unfortunately, it produces a *lot* of noise, for code such as
static ssize_t disk_show(struct subsystem * subsys, char * buf)
{
        return sprintf(buf, "%s\n", pm_disk_modes[pm_disk_mode]);
}
...where pm_disk_mode is __bitwise. That is not really what we
want. Would it be possible to get something similar to __bitwise where
arithmetic is still okay to do? With __bitwise, I'd need to do:
