I missed that.  But, it's incorrect.  You're doubly incrementing kicked
in the case of CPUs that are booted correctly and getting to kicked >=
NR_CPUS a lot quicker.  That's why you're booting correctly.
Secondly, we can actually boot up to NR_CPUS cpus, and we can *fail* to
boot a lot more than that.  At least that's what the code is trying to
do.  Whether it is "the right thing" is debatable.
