OK, I see you and I use the source for two different things.  I use it
to build kernels.  As such, I always untar as my normal userid.  It
never occurred to me that some people just like to have it around to
look at.
And I never said it wasn't a problem that Linus had these files mode
600.  I just thought asking him to `chmod -R go+rX' every kernel
release was maybe a bit overboard.  Come to think of it, maybe the
`chmod' should become a part of your untar process.
