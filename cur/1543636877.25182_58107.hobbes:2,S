IMHO this is unwise as the system NEEDS to exit to user (or
system) space when preempt_count is zero with a garuntee
that TIF_NEED_RESCHED is 0.  To do this from irq.c means
that it must exit with interrupts off and the the low level
code needs to keep them off till the irtn.  But this is
where we test TIF_NEED_RESCHED, and if it is set, schedule()
is called and should be called with preempt_count != 0, to
avoid stack overflow interrupt loops.  And, schedule()
returns with the interrupt system on (even if we, unwisely,
call it with it off).

Nope, you got it right.
