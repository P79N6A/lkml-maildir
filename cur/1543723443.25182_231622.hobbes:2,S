There's a from-scratch reimplementation of BPF in Linux (called Linux
Socket Filter) by Jay Schulist in net/core/filter.c. And he appears to
have worked for the _Wisconsin_ school district at the time. A Google
search on "schulist filter wisconsin" reveals:
  Jay Schulist, a senior software engineer with Pleasanton,
  California's Bivio Networks says he wrote the 500 lines of code in
  1997 as part of a volunteer project for the Stevens Point Area
  Catholic Schools in Wisconsin. "I used it for helping a local school
  district in my home town to connect their old Apple Macintosh machines
  to the Internet," he said.
