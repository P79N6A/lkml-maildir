I don't know how useful this might but.  I've been trying to
track down which patches to as-iosched resulted in the performance
drop.  The results so far are a little confusing.  I have been
running reaim on an 8-way system, comparing as-iosched performance
with deadline, on each kernel version.  The numbers are "number
of jobs per minute".  So, larger is better.
			Deadline		As-iosched
2.6.0-test5   		8542			8589
2.6.0-test5-mm1		8303			8401
2.6.0-test5-mm2		8309			8224
2.6.0-test5-mm3		8222			8417
2.6.0-test6		8302			6934	****
2.6.0-test6-mm1		8375			8163
2.6.0-test6-mm2		???			8309
I'm still getting data on test6-mm*.  It's curious that
performance dropped for test6, but came back for test6-mm1.
