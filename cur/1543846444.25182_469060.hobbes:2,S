	Wireless Tools with the new API were released in
April. wpa_supplicant with the new API was release May 5th. That makes
it 6 months.
	Wireless Tools v28 was included in Gentoo April 11th and in
Debian testing May 27th. wpa_supplicant 0.4.9 was included in Gentoo
May 27th and Debian testing June 10th.
	Please consider the facts before assuming.
	Jean
