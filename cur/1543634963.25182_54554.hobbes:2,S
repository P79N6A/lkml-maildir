Just wondering, how come df reports
root:~# df /mnt/export/
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda5              2562252    383792   2178460  15% /mnt/export
on the server, while on a client that mounts /mnt/export over nfs:
[root@space download]# df /mnt/nfs/
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
lfs:/mnt/export        2562256    383792   2178464  15% /mnt/nfs
Just a few blocks diffrent, but I've seen much bigger.. also seen +/-
a few % on "Use"
