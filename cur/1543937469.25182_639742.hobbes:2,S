I suspect that the IO hardware you have is very sensitive to the color of the
physical page. I wonder, do you boot the system cleanly and then run these
tests? If so, it would be interesting to know what happens if you stress
the system first (many kernel compiles for example, basically anything that
would use a lot of memory in different ways for some time) to randomise the
free lists a bit and then run your test. You'd need to run the test
three times for 2.6.23, 2.6.24-rc8 and 2.6.24-rc8 with the patch you
identified reverted.

That patch was not an optimisation, it was a regression fix against 2.6.23
and I don't believe reverting it is an option. Other IO hardware benefits
from having the allocator supply pages in PFN order. Your controller would
seem to suffer when presented with the same situation but I don't know why
that is. I've added James to the cc in case he has seen this sort of
situation before.

Could you try running your tests again when the system has been stressed
with some other workload first?
