Hello,
In order to keep an interface I'm used to, I'd like to include a subset of 
list.h (basic list funcionality, without RCU) in a library which will be 
released under the LGPL.
Being it mostly macros and inlines and quite obvious functionality, rewriting 
is would be like rewriting variables :)
So, who is the copyright holder of that file, so that I can ask him permission 
to use the file in a Lesser GPL project?
Thanks!
Bye,
