Right now, the /proc and sysctl code is not changed at all.
However, the end goal will be to remove the /proc and sysctl code
entirely, and just use sysfs, as this is exactly what sysfs is for.  I
know, in order to do this properly the userspace library will need to be
changed, and I'm willing to do this work too.  I do not want to break
userspace compatibility needlessly.
I'll not remove anything until the same functionality can be achieved,
is this ok?  I will, of course, provide patches that for people to
evaluate, when it's working...

Christoph's changes preserve the existing code, but make it work without
oopses :)
thanks,
