Just an excuse.
Someone determined enough would hex edit the code to change the signal
power.  The FCC isn't stupid enough to believe obfuscation prevents
abuse.  They just have laws against using too high a power.  Of course
enforcing it isn't easy either.  And the firmware can't prevent you from
changing the antenna and/or using a signal booster.
