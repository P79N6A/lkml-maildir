Hello,
Kernel 2.2.x - 2.2.5  and vesafb on console   (This did work under
2.1.125 as far as I can remember )
When I display a Textfile  with less (version 332) larger than
screensize
and hit the key 'b' in less (Hint: hit space to scroll down some pages)
less tries to scroll back the text. This takes so much cpu-power that
sound
(mpg123) stops until the 50 lines are scrolled  and it needs severals
seconds  to scroll the lines on
my 350 AMD !!. Every task on the machine seems to stop working as long
as
the lines are scrolled back.
I believe this is a bug.
