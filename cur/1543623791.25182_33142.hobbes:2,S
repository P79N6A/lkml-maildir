I was thinking an explicit GFP_READAHEAD and PG_readahead.
Where a GFP_READAHEAD allocation would fail if it can't 
find any non-readahead pages.  And it would fail if it
had to perform I/O.
That's not nice - it'd result in large LRU walks.  But it'd
be better than the 10x slowdown which readahead thrashing
causes.
Any clever ideas?
