I probably won't merge that unless the full NLKD somehow manages to get 
into mainline. Shouldn't be that hard to maintain out of tree or even
build the debugger in a fully separate directory.
My general suggestion would be to move away from using your own
defines for all the architecture state (MSRs etc) but instead use
the ones from the Linux headers instead which should be largely
equivalent (if there are some missing we can probably add them) 
And getting of that Intel style assembly would be good too.
I would move the asm-offset bits into a separate file, perhaps run from
the NLKD Makefile, that should reduce later merging pain.
