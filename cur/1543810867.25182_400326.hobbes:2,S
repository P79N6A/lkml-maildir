Many people use smake on platforms where there is no other
sufficiently compliant make program.
As GNU make incorrectly states to run on many plaforms, there are 
a lot of people who suffer from the fact that GNU make is not maintained

Note that I did make bug reports against GNU make that have been accepted as 
bugs but never fixed!
