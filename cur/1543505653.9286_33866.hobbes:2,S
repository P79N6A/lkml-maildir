Thanks for the help. This worked after I turned off demand dialing. Is
there a way to get demand dialing to work? Here is what I got while trying
to use demand dialing:
Aug 11 17:54:37 ketchers pppd[2013]: Exit.
Aug 11 17:56:40 ketchers pppd[2018]: pppd 2.3.9 started by root, uid 0
Aug 11 17:56:41 ketchers pppd[2018]: Using interface ppp0
Aug 11 17:56:41 ketchers pppd[2018]: ioctl(PPPIOCSASYNCMAP): Bad file
descriptor(9)
I went through each option one by one until this went away, and it was
demand dialing that is causing it.

| I use PPP as a module, the 2.3.7 driver broke with kernel 2.3.13
|  and 2.3.9pre works. I didn't find the 2.3.9 final tarball, but
|  the pre- version appears to work.
