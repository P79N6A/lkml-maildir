So the semantics of pci_set_mwi() are "try to set MWI if this
platform/device supports it".
In that case its interface is misdesigned, because it doesn't discriminate
between "yes-it-does/no-it-doesn't" (which we don't want to report, because
either is expected and legitimate) and "something screwed up", which we do
want to report, because it is always unexpected.
So an appropriate return value protocol would be
0:	No error, unable to set MWI
1:	No error, able to set MWI
-EFOO:	Error
