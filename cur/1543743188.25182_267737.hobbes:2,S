Some code parts is using diffirent error handling.
if(err1) {
	clenup1;
	return -ERR1;
}
...
if(err2) {
	cleanup2;
	return -ERR2;
}
Shouldn't it be converted into:
err = -ERR1;
if(err1)
	goto cleanup1;
...
err = -ERR2;
if(err2)
	goto cleanup2;
I think there should be one methond, which will be used in all kernel code.
