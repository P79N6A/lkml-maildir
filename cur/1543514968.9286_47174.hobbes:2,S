I assume this allocates single pages (1024 bytes) and I would need to use
__get_free_pages() specifying the best fit. I'll need to track the
allocations though so when it comes to free_page()'ing I use the right
'order' value.

No DMA involved.

I'm RedHat'ing with 2.2.5-15.

So what are the chances of kmalloc(102400) x 3 and the three malloc'ed areas
being continuous :)?
