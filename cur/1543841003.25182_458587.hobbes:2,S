It is a component of psmouse.o, which is a few lines up.
Breaking out the components of psmouse.o into separate configuration
items might be interesting, but it is quite a bit beyond the scope of
this patch.

Fixed.
It should not actually matter, as a failure to get a !NULL value causes
us to return false, which will fall over to other psmouse drivers which
will either set it themselves, or not use it at all, however.
It should be noted that alps.c contains the same issue.

Alright, added to my todo, should have it done by the next patch
revision.
Thank you very much.
