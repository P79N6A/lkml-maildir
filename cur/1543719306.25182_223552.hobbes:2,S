OK, apparently now the cp never finishes and nothing gets written to
disk, so i could not get the full output from sysrq-t.
I wrote the call stack from the process, it that enough?
The call stack from the cp process:
__make_request
schedule_timeout
process_timeout
io_schedule_timeout
blk_congestion_wait
autoremove_wake_function
autoremove_wake_function
get_dirty_limits
balance_dirty_pages
generic_file_aio_write_nolock
__copy_to_user_ll
file_read_actor
__generic_file_aio_read
file_read_actor
generic_file_write_nolock
do_sync_read
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
generic_file_write
cifs_write_wrapper
do_sync_read
vfs_write
sys_write
syscall_call
Also the call from a vi process that was called after the cp reached
that state and was also blocked
schedule_timeout
ext3_mark_inode_dirty
process_timeout
io_schedule_timeout
blk_congestion_wait
autoremove_wake_function
get_dirty_limits
balance_dirty_pages
generic_file_aio_write_nolock
buffered_rmqueue
__alloc_pages
generic_file_aio_write
ext2_file_write
do_sync_write
do_lookup
path_release
sys_access
vfs_write
sys_write
syscall_call
If more detail is needed I can try to capture it but syslog not writing
to disk I don't know how to capture the sysrq-t output
Thanks
