I have a series of patches to dmapool that I'd like opinions on.  I
don't have any performance numbers yet, but some of the patches are a
good idea, with or without performance numbers.
One of the problems with dmapool is that it doesn't have a maintainer
listed.  I've spent enough time looking at it over the past couple of
weeks that I think I'd be comfortable in that role, so unless someone
objects, I'll submit a patch to MAINTAINERS to add myself.
I shan't post the first two patches.  The first simply Lindents the code
and the second moves it to mm/ (a better fit than drivers/base, IMO).
Four patches to follow.

operating system, but compare it to ours.  We can't possibly take such
a retrograde step."
