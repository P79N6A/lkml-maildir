ok, great. Could you try the patch below ontop of 2.6.18-rc6, does it 
'fix' your bootup too?
the original patch (which this patch reverses) is harmless: it changes 
the priority calculation of reniced tasks from:
	p->prio = NICE_TO_PRIO(nice);
to:
	p->prio = effective_prio(p);
which is a correct change, because NICE_TO_PRIO() gives a 'static' value 
that is not modified by interactivity bonuses/penalties, while 
effective_prio() is the kind of prio every task should get. I.e. 
sys_nice(1) used to (incorrectly) discard the interactive bias of a 
task, until the end of the timeslice.
so i'm afraid you managed to trigger a race in the IDE driver that used 
to be dormant until now... To debug such races the best method is to 
create a 'trace' by printk-ing key points of the port/disk detection 
mechanism. [another option would be to use the latency tracer to do a 
_really_ finegrained trace of the incident - assuming that the bug does 
not go away due to tracing overhead.]

Subject: [patch] revert set_user_nice() change
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
revert an otherwise correct fix.
this disturbs dynamic priorities (of user and kernel threads),
so it could have an impact on timing-sensitive races.
