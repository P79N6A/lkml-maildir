The current policy has always been not to trust events that are
precisely externally controllable. Oliver hasn't changed the network
policy there at all.
Its probably true there are low bits of randomness available from such
sources providing we know the machine has a tsc, unless the I/O APIC is
clocked at a divider of the processor clock in which case our current
behaviour is probably much saner.
With modern systems that have real RNG's its a non issue.
