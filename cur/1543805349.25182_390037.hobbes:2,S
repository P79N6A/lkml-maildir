I'd prefer to see all of the extended stuff left out entirely for now.
The mainline kernel has no PMU support for any popular architecture,
even though external patches have existed in stable form for years.
Filling that gap ought to be the priority; the interface can be extended
when actual users of new features show up and ask for them.

The place for flailing around with uncooked ideas is arguably not the
mainline kernel.

Speculatively adding complicated and unused interfaces to the kernel in
the hope that some wild-eyed visionary might eventually up and use them
helps nobody.
