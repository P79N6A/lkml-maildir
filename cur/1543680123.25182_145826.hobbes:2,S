That's not correct in this case, because the sound servicing routine is 
realtime, which makes it special.  Furthermore, Zinf is already trying to 
provide the kernel with the hint it needs via PThreads SetPriority but 
because Linux has brain damage - both in the kernel and user space imho - the 
hint isn't accomplishing what it's supposed to.
As I said earlier: trying to detect automagically which threads are realtime 
and which aren't is stupid.  Such policy decisions don't belong in the 
kernel.
