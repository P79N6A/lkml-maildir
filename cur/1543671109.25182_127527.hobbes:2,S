I don't like this one.  DEFINE_WAIT allocates stuff on the stack.  
And aio seems to allocate a lot more on the stack than normal io does.
How about the following instead:
int blk_congestion_wait_wq(int rw, long timeout, wait_queue_t *wait)
{
 	wait_queue_head_t *wqh = &congestion_wqh[rw];
 	blk_run_queues();
	prepare_to_wait(wqh, wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	if (!is_sync_wait(wait)) 
		return -EIOCBRETRY;
	io_schedule_timeout(timeout);
	finish_wait(wqh, wait);
	return 0;
}
void blk_congestion_wait(int rw, long timeout)
{
	DEFINE_WAIT(wait);
	blk_congestion_wait_wq(rw, timeout, &wait);
}
