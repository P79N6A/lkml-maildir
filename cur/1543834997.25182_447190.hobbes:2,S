The following patch provides better protection against people exploiting stuff
in /proc and I hope you consider it for upstream inclusion.
Thanks.

[PATCH] Require mmap handler for a.out executables
Files supported by fs/proc/base.c, i.e. /proc/<pid>/*, are not capable
of meeting the validity checks in ELF load_elf_*() handling because they
have no mmap handler which is required by ELF. In order to stop a.out
executables being used as part of an exploit attack against /proc-related
vulnerabilities, we make a.out executables depend on ->mmap() existing.
