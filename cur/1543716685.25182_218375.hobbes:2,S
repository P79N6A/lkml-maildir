We need to think about why real applications (as opposed to benchmarks) use
MAP_SHARED.  I suspect many of them will modify pages again and again and
again.  We really want to avoid writing these pages out until the
application has truly finished with them.
I think it is probably the case that pages which were dirtied with write(2)
are much less likely to be redirtied than pages which were dirtied via
MAP_SHARED.
One thing you might like to look at is to give these pages another trip
around the LRU after they have been unmapped from pagetables, and to give
pdflush a poke.  Add instrumentation to record how many pages end up
getting written via vmscan's writepage versus via pdflush (use
current_is_pdflush()).
