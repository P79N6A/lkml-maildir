Hi Tomas,
This problem *may* actually be in the hardware...  IIRC the CSB5 rev 93h is
the A2.1 version of the chip which had big problems with DMA.  The workaround
options included a messy rework of the PCB or forcing it into PIO mode, so we
decided instead to just stick with the A2.0 revision. :)
However all of my knowledge about this particular issue is based on >1yr old
information, so if you want to send the output of "lspci -xxx" for pci devices
00:0f.0 and 00:0f.1 I will check them over for any obvious settings the BIOS
may have missed.
