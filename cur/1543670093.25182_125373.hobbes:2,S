The patch compiles and the warning messages are gone now.
But, I still can't mount a zip disk.
Kernel messages after mounting a zip disk (mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 
/mnt/zip):
SCSI device sda: 196608 512-byte hdwr sectors (101 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: Mode Sense: 25 00 00 08
sda: cache data unavailable
sda: assuming drive cache: write through

The kernel messages are showing twice, does it try to mount the zip disk 
two times?
At this point the mount process is stuck:
[root@viper root]# ps -ax | grep zip
  998 tty1     D      0:00 mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /mnt/zip
 1057 tty2     S      0:00 grep zip
