Actually, this one is more complicated. You also need to actually enable 
hardware interrupts again if they got disabled by an interrupt actually 
occurring while the "soft-interrupt" was disabled.
But since it's all a local-cpu issue, you can do things like test 
cpu-local memory flags for whetehr that has happened or not.
So it *should* be something as simple as
	local_irq_disable()
	{
		pda.irq_enable = 0;
	}
	handle_interrupt()
	{
		if (!pda.irq_enable) {
			pda.irq_queued = 1;
			queue_interrupt();
			.. make sure we return with hardirq's now 
			   disabled: just clear IF in the pt_regs ..
			return;
		}
		.. normal ..
	}
	local_irq_enable()
	{
		pda.irq_enable = 1;
		barrier();
		/* Common case - nothing happened while we were fake-disabled.. */
		if (!pda.irq_queued)
			return; 
		/* Ok, actually handle the things! */
		handle_queued_irqs();
		/*
		 * And enable the hw interrupts again, they got disabled 
		 * when we were queueing stuff.. 
		 */
		hardware_sti();
	}
but I haven't really gone over it in any detail, I may have missed 
something really obvious.
Anyway, it really *should* be pretty damn simple. No need to disable 
preemption, there should be no events that can *cause* it, since all 
interrupts get headed off at the pass.. (the return-from-interrupt thng 
should already notice that it's returning to an interrupts-disabled 
section and not try to do any preemption).
What did I miss?
