   Hmmm, are you really sure? I thought there was always a finite deadline
   for a dirty buffer to be flushed to memory and to be made visible to all
   other CPUs.
   If you're right then we definitely need wmb() there ;).
Yes, I am really sure.  In fact in the Sparc v9 architecture manual
they specifically give an example of a piece producer/consumer code
where this issue pops up and membars are needed.
