Which APIC? local or I/O? Please be specific.
"noapic" does not and never has had anything to do with the
local APIC, only the I/O APIC. There is currently no kernel
option for preventing the local APIC from being enabled if
the kernel was built with local APIC support.
You have four options:
1. Recompile with CONFIG_SMP=n and CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=n.
2. Run dmidecode on your Vaio, dig out the identification strings,
   and add them to arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c's local APIC
   blacklist.
3. Add a __setup in arch/i386/kernel/apic.c after the declaration
   for dont_enable_local_apic, which sets it to 1.
4. Tell Sony to fix the Vaio's BIOS.
