i can't imagine this is a widespread problem in the tree -- i mean, we
keep using CONFIG_EMBEDDED as an example, and we mostly agree that
that's just a bad design, anyway.
but it should be obvious that, if you look at the Kconfig files, each
and every "select" directive has the potential to override a decision
you think you might have made elsewhere.
I'm just sayin'.
