Hi!
    As you can see the latest tested framebuffer changes went in. The 
issues is 99% of my testers are ix86 users. Because of this changes on non 
ix86 platforms often break. The biggest issue is 64 bit platforms. Most 
people don't own such machines. So what I like to ask is if someone with a 
64 bit machine volunteer to test all my changes. Once this is done then 
the framebuffer changes will be bullet proof. Thank you.
