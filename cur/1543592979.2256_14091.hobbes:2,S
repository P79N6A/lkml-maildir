Would it be great to have a similar documentation for those hundreds of
"files" under /proc ?. Something like:
/proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min
Subsystem: RAID
Module:    md.o
Configuration Option: Multi-device support (RAID and LVM) -> Multiple
devices driver support (RAID and LVM) -> RAID support
Type: positive integer ¿32-bit? long
Units: kilobytes per second
Related ioctls: /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max
Short description: minumun guaranteed array reconstruction speed (in KB/s).
Description: minimun guaranteed array reconstruction speed for RAID-0, 
RAID-5 and the ones derived from them. When the array is reconstructing, 
this parameter sets the minimun reconstruction speed of the array, 
borrowing I/O time from applications if needed. Don't set this parameter 
too high or your system will be very little responsive when the array is
reconstructing (give applications I/O some room :).
Is this something reasonable to ?.
Regards.
