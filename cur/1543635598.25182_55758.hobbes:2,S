Definitely:
my_timeout = foo*HZ;

Oops! Sorry I missed that one. Not that it matters for
the 2.5.25 kernel and above, but that code really should
be using the Hertz value supplied by libproc.

Hell yes. It's going to remain evil until the 2.4 kernel
is a distant memory. Debian uses a 2.2 kernel in the
upcoming release, so it will be a good long time until
everyone is using a 2.6 kernel. When 2.8 comes out,
Debian will finally stop using 2.4 and I can get rid of
my evil hack.
Hey, I asked for a clean way to get HZ. I didn't even
get "send a patch"; I got BS about the 2.5.25 behavior
being standard, as if it had already been implemented.

That's broken. It can't even correctly report the
number of processors you have.
