  I am currently in the process of writing a disk-trace collection tool
for ext2fs, for the purpose of playing around with file system
optimization / performance evaluation (simulation, playback, etc.).
  Two questions: 
  1) Has anyone done trace collection for ext2fs before?  I've been
lurking and searching, but can find no such tool or reference to one --
I'd hate to replicate work already done when I could be extending on
something already existing.
  2) Anyone interested in disk trace data?  So far, my tool is somewhat
feature-poor, but I'm very interested in making it more complete if others
would find this type of data interesting.
