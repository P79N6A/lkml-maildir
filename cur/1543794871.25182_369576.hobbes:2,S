Hi Ingo,
Are you still the maintainer of IO-APIC support?
I really appreciated if you could forward the following patch to 
a right person.

 Subject: [PATCH] fix to clock running too fast
----
This one line patch adds upper bound testing inside timer_irq_works()
when evaluating whether irq timer works or not on boot up.
It fix the machines having problem with clock running too fast.
What this patch do is,
if  timer interrupts running too fast through IO-APIC IRQ then false back to 
i8259A IRQ.
I really appreciate for the feedback from ATI Xpress 200 chipset user,
It should eliminate the needs of adding no_timer_check on kernel options.
I have NEC laptop using ATI Xpress 200 chipset with Pentium M 1.8GHz and 
its clock keep going forward when kernel compiled with local APIC support.
Many machines based on RS200 chipset seem to have the same problem, 
including Acer Ferrari 400X AMD notebook or Compaq R4000.
Also I would like to have comments on upper bound limit, 16 ticks, which 
I chose in this patch. My laptop always reports around 20, which is double from normal.
