Ages and ages ago (ok, not that long ago, really) I remember reading a
vaguely similar arugment on Fidonet.
The argument was largely over the format of the "next gen" message
format - RFC822 came up a lot, and the ensuing "binary header" vs "ASCII
header" arguments would follow.
All I really learned from that was, "parsing email headers is more 
complicated than people suspect" (binary or ascii, doesn't matter), and that
ASCII has one advantage that more compact/binary/etc formats lack:
When the ASCII file/header/partition table/whatever gets fscked
beyond all recognition, I can fix the goddamn thing with a text editor.
That last part is the reason most people utterly detest things like the
Windows registry and prefer the (imo, at least), much saner /etc design
prevalent in Linux distributions.
