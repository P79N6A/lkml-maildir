You know how much code there is in glibc to make your /bin/ls still work?
That being said, it in general isn't a problem to continue to use the 
same exact sets of system calls, but that also means skipping any new 
functionality.  In recent memory that includes things like 64-bit file 
offsets and high signals, even more recently it means things like 
openat() and splice().  A full-blown libc also has to deal with 
LinuxThreads version NPTL.  Etc.
Again, I fully expect that klibc-0.1 still works on the current kernels, 
but current klibc wouldn't work on 2.4 kernels.
