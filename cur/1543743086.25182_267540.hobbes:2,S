This is a big allocation and the kernel is having problem finding such a 
big page, due to memory fragmentation (as you mention below).
What kernel version are you using?
-mm contains a series of patches from Nick which should make the situation 
better, have you tried it? Currently kswapd doenst honour high order 
page shortage.

We're working on that.

Its OK to use these flags externally. They might change in future major kernel
versions though, or even future v2.6 release.  ie its not a stable API.
