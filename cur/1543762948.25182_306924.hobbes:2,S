Hi all,
   swsusp is not working for me with 2.6.12rc1. I compiled the kernel
   preempt, I am compiling now without preempt to test it. -mm3 has a
   similar behaviour.
   All the configuration, dmesg, lsmod etc is here: 
   
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/config-2.6.12-rc1/laptop-config.html
   
   Perfectly working (swsup included) similar data is in: 
   
http://www.dea.icai.upco.es/romano/linux/config-2.6.11-rg/laptop-config.html
   When suspending, it stops dead with thi two lines (hand copied) 
   ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:07.5 [C] -> GSI 5 (level, low) -> IRQ5
   ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:0e.0 [A] -> GSI 9 (level, low) -> IRQ9
   
   ...and nothing more.
