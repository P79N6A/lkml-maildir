I like it.  I'm glad Sam mentioned sub-configs such as Config.3c5xx, 
that's something that was discussed a while ago [and apparently we all 
forgot about it subsequently :)]
And the above eliminates my criticism of having "Config.in" be two 
different config languages, depending on your kernel version.
