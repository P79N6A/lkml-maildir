What would be the benefit of having private non-visible vfsmounts?
Sounds like a recipe for confusion?
It is possible that mountd might start doing bind-mounts to create the
'pseudo filesystem' thing for NFSv4, but they would be very visible
(under /var/lib/nfs/v4root or something).  So having it's own vfsmount
might make sense, but I don't get 'non-visible'.
