As described in the posting that Magnus linked to, it seemed to me
like the cleaner approach - if there is no need to link two CONFIG
options, then don't.
Perhaps someone wants to build a uni-processor (UP) kernel for other
reasons, but still have it support running some stuff that depends
on cpusets being present.
But my vote on UP issues isn't worth much.  This patch is no biggie
to me either way.
