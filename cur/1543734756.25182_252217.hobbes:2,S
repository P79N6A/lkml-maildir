Can you make an example? Some scenario where this would be important?

It's async. You can't rely on return values. They'd have to be in
netlink messages.

How so? For process fields, the request block is one u32 indicating the
number of field IDs to follow, then a bunch of u32 containing field IDs.
Any subset of field IDs, in any order of the tool's choosing.
The kernel replies with one message per process, each message containing
all the fields the tool requested, in the same order.

One field at a time at all times is unnecessarily slow.
