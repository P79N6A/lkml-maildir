I dug out the reference drivers. The reference drivers use the delay and
the 8390 datasheet confirms it is neccessary.
The Crynwr driver has some interesting things to say
| The National 8390 Chip (NIC) requires 4 bus clocks between successive
| chip selects (National DP8390 Data Sheet Addendum, June 1990)
Also " To establish a minimum delay, an I/O instruction must be used. A
good rule of ; thumb is that ISA I/O instructions take ~1.0 microseconds
and MCA I/O ; instructions take ~0.5 microseconds. Reading the NMI Status
Register (0x61) ; is a good way to pause on all machines."
But all the official drivers use pauses and the manual says they are
needed for correct, reliable behaviour - at least with a genuine 8390.
