I know. But gratuitous / and cwd for threads are in the way. If they
aren't needed, get rid of them. Might help in other cases too.

I fully understand that. But if it doesn't cost much to round it out
and give it a clean definition (i.e., works only for directories that
aren't in use, no mounts underneath allowed; and then make the rest of
the kernel able to comply for /) is a win IMHV. Might be useful in
other cases too (it would in fact provide atomic umount + mount
another fs) if used elsewhere.
