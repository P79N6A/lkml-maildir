Hch,
I did try to CC linux-scsi in the original email for the 3ware driver submission/review,
and 2 emails since then.  None of them went through (no bounce message either).  
Does anybody know what the max email size is?  Is it < 145k?

In addition driver submission should always go through linux-scsi.  Please
tell them to submit it to linux-scsi so we can have a public review process
there.
