It seems the oops is happening in a module's function.
You have to make ksymoops parse the oops output against a System.map which
has all modules symbols. Load each module by hand with the insmod -m
option ("insmod -m module.o") and _append_ the outputs to System.map.
After that you can run ksymoops against this new System.map.
