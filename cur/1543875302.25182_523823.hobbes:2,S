Sure (compiling the kernel now), too bad old axiom that testing can not
confirm absence of bugs holds.
I have one nit and one request from clarification. Question first (i
admit i haven't looked at the surroundings of the patch maybe things
would have been are self evident if i did):
What this patch amounts to is that the accounting logic is moved from
timer interrupt to the place where scheduler switches task (or something
to that effect)?

A nit. Anything wrong with:
time_diff = now - p->last_ran;
if (unlikeley (LESS_THAN_ZERO (time_diff))
         return;
