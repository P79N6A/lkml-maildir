I don't know a vast amount about ARM ELF user space so no.

One way to do this is to use kprobes which will do exactly what you want
as it builds a kernel module. Doesn't currently run on ARM afaik.

Not easily with gdbstubs as you've got to talk to something to decide how
to log the data and proceed. If you stick it kernel side its a lot of
ugly new code and easier to port kprobes over, if you do it remotely as
gdbstubs intends it adds latencies and screws all your timings.
gdbstubs is also not terribly SMP aware and for low level work its
sometimes easier to have on gdb per processor if you can get your brain
around it.
