Sorry, I have missed that 0x5975 was already defined for radeonfb.
So this patch shouldn't be applied.
We have already:
        /*Mobility Xpress 200 */
        CHIP_DEF(PCI_CHIP_RS485_5975,   R300,   CHIP_HAS_CRTC2 | CHIP_IS_IGP | CHIP_IS_MOBILITY),
This was introduced with commit b5f2f4d1a6d7efde39cfb5e1d034981c69f2214c
But obviously this is not correct as the 0x5975 is an RS48x not R300.
With the current git (w/o my patch) my display goes blank (or better it looks striped)
and the Laptop hangs.
I'll do some further tests on my Laptop and probably come up with a new patch.
Regards,
Andreas
