I do not agree. As I understand C "name" is a table, i.e. a pointer to a
prealocated area of size of 4*IFNAMSIZ*sizeof(char) bytes. There is no
pointers to the strings stored seprately. 
[ The strings are copied into the apropriate locations in the array during
  initialization ]
After applying the mentioned patch just the whole area of the array will be
zeroed. Not only the first characters of name[i] i=0,1,2,3 ...
