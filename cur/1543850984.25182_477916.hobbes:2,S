I used Takashi's revised patch, but rc3 works w/o patching:
dvanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.13 (Sun Oct 22 08:56:16 
2006 UTC).
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [AAZA] enabled at IRQ 23
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.1[B] -> Link [AAZA] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> 
IRQ 23
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:10.1 to 64
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input1
hda_intel: No response from codec, disabling MSI...
ALSA device list:
  #0: HDA NVidia at 0xfe028000 irq 316
And it disables MSI automatically.
