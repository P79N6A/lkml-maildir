I use Netconsole for routine monitoring.
See Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
Example for kernel command line
netconsole=1024@192.168.2.131/eth0,4450@192.168.2.1/00:00:0E:5F:15:64
You don't want to hassle with netcat.
Many sysloggers can log udp
I use syslog-ng. Excerpts from configuration:
source netlog { 
	udp(ip(0.0.0.0) port(4450)); 
};
destination netlog
{ 
	file("/var/log/netlog"); 
};
log 
{ 
	source(netlog); 
	destination("netlog"); 
	flags(final); 
};
