Where can I get the patches for using extra RAM as swap/ramdisk?
I've got an extra 32M stick just sitting here.
<OFFTOPIC>
Also, does anyone know where I can find out how to either do the
same in Win95, or how I can totally disable the extra 32M in
Win95?  Is there a registry setting?
Feel free to point me to a URL, or to a more appropriate forum
for such a Win question.  I have no idea what ms forums there
are.
</OFFTOPIC>
<BACKONTOPIC>
Why are the patches to allow the extra RAM not built into the
kernel in the first place?
Will they ever get included?  Perhaps in 2.3.something?
Just curious.
