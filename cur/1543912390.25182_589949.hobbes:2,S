I took drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c and sprinkled ENTER/EXIT printk's.
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/ide/pci/via82cxxx.c
via82cxxx_tune_drive() and via82cxxx_ide_dma_check() both call 
via_set_drive() which calls ide_config_drive_speed().
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/ide/ide-iops.c#L769
   if (error)
   {
     (void) ide_dump_status(drive, "set_drive_speed_status", stat);
     printk(KERN_INFO "EXIT %s error\n", __func__);
     return error;
   }
Does someone know why error is not set to 0?
