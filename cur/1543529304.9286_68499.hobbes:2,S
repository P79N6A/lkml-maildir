It depends entirely on the load:
1) If you have 8000 open fds but the data
   is only coming in on one at a time, then you are asking the kernel to
   check 8000 sockets every time one piece of data has to be dealt with.
   That is inefficient.
2) If you call poll on 8000 fds and find several hundred or more of them
   active, then you've just obtained a lot of information about pending
   work with just a single syscall.  That is efficient.
So it starts getting dicey based on the incoming workload.
Unfortunately, internet servers see a lot more of case 1) than of case
2), because slow clients and packet loss lead to long stalls on a lot of
your connections.
The 2.2 supports a queued-signal mechanism which tells you exactly which
sockets have data pending, and when.  We've polished that mechanism
significantly for 2.3.  Using that sort of API lets you avoid the
performance penalty of checking for idle sockets.
