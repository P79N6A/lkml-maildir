You are about to duplicate

I imagine the main difference is you're targeting Posix
compliance rather than LSB compliance.  That seems
like a fairly minor difference that could be
accommodated within the framework of the LTP.
Or do you feel the existing test framework
and tests assembled in LTP are so inadequate that you
need to start an entirely new project doing
essentially the same thing?
(Apologies if you've already answered this question.  I did
check your web page, but didn't see an answer.)
