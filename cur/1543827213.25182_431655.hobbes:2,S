Subject: How long can an inode structure reside in the inode_cache?

I was wondering how Linux decide to free an inode from the
inode_cache? If a file is open, an inode structure will be created and
put into the inode_cache, but when will this inode be free and removed
from the inode_cache? after this file is closed? If so, this seems to
be inefficient.
Can someone tell me how Linux handle this issue?
Thanks,
Xin
