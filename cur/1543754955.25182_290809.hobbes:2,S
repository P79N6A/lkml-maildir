it seems the most scalable solution for this would be a global flag plus
per-CPU spinlocks (or per-CPU mutexes) to make this totally scalable and
still support the requirements of this rare event. An rwsem really
bounces around on SMP, and it seems very unnecessary in the case you
described.
possibly this could be formalised as an rwlock/rwlock implementation
that scales better. brlocks were such an attempt.

nono, i have no such plans.
