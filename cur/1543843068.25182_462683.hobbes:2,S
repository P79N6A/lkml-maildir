Useless (void *) casts are out of fashion. You shouldn't copy mine.

for ( ; page < page + (1 << bb->order), page++)
      SetPageSlab(page);
I'm not sure it even makes sense to mark the bigblock pages,
especially for the purposes of kobjsize. But see below.

Please drop the BUG. We've already established it's on our lists by
this point.

You just broke the bit that shrinks the arena.
I don't like this patch. We've just grown SLOB by about 10% everywhere
to make nommu happy. Is this needed because nommu is doing something
special for MMU-less machines or because it's doing something bogus?
To my eyes, the answer seems to clearly be the latter. There's nothing
nommu-specific about kobjsize at all, so it ought to be in the main
kernel if it's actually kosher. But kobjsize tries to guess the size
of an object of unknown type, which is a very suspicious business. If
you've got a pointer, I would propose you ought to know what type it
is, or ought not mess with it at all.
Looking through all the users of kobjsize, it seems we always know
what the type is (and it's usually a VMA). I instead propose we use
ksize on objects we know to be SLAB/SLOB-allocated and add a new
function (kpagesize?) to size other objects where nommu needs it.
As for whether SLOB should emulate PG_slab on general principles, as
far as I can tell, PG_slab should be considered a private debugging
aid to SLAB. All the other users look rather bogus to my eye.
If anything, SLOB should internally abuse PG_slab to mark big pages
and dispense with its bigblocks lists.
