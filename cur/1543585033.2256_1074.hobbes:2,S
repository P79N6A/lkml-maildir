The default maximum number of scatter/gather segments in the tape driver
is 16. This means that big chunks of memory are needed to allocate a 2 MB
buffer. You can increase the number of segments up to, e.g., 128. This
means that only 16 kB chunks are needed to make up a 2 MB buffer. The
number of scatter/gather segments is also limited by your SCSI adapter
driver. Note that even with 16 kB segments you may find problems at
some time because multi-page allocations are needed.
You can increase the number of scatter/gather segments at system
startup/module loading or when compiling the driver. See the file
linux/drivers/scsi/README.st for the syntax and st_options.h for the
compile-time definition.
