Problem is, it doesn't seem that we'll be merging unionfs any time soon so
we shouldn't be adding slab infrastructure on its behalf.  And I'd prefer
not to have to carry slab changes in a filesystem tree.
Although if the changes are generally ok-looking and are compact then it'd
be OK, but I do need to be alert for someone who comes along and uses that
infrastructure in an unrelated patch, which has happened before.  When I
prep the patch for an upstream merge, oops, doesn't compile any more.
So for now, it'd be best to jsut forget about the optimisation.
How useful is it, anyway?
