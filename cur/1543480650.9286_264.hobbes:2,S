Yeah, I found this awesome answer!  It's spelled L-I-N-U-X.  Ever since
I started using Linux, I use Microsoft Windows less and less.
Go down to your local software shop, look for Red Hat Linux or Caldera
Linux or SuSE Linux or anything Linux, and buy it.
(Pick up a penguin tee shirt if they have it, penguins are cuter
and have a lot more personality than a four-colored flag).
Install it on your system and try it out.
I don't know if AOL has a Linux version of their AOL client yet.
Why don't you call them and ask them?
If you like Linux, feel free to share the CD-ROM with your friends.
It's open source software so it's legal to do this.  Tell them to
call AOL and ask about a Linux version of the AOL software, too.
The more people who call, the better.
Hope this helps,
Michael Elizabeth Chastain
