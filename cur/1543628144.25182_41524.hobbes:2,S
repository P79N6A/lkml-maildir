I still can't seem to make it work sigh. The raid
seems to initialize but the lvm wacks.
boot sda1:/vmlinux.ga root=/dev/lvm00/idsk0 initrd=initrd.gz
It appears my problem is the kerenl is trying to load
initrd off of the lvm volume but in order for the
lvm volume to be activated the initrd needs to go first.
sda1 is a msdos disk with the kernel and the initrd,gz ball.
Any suggestions or manuals out there?
