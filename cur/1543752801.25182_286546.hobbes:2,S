Kernel 2.6.11-rc1-mm1 is just out, which does contain the latest updates
to the it87 driver. I would like you to test them. What you should see:
1* When loading the it87 driver, the fans should not change speeds.
2* In the logs, you should see an information line with the chip type,
address and revision.
3* Still in the logs, you should see a warning about your BIOS being
broken and PWM being disabled as a consequence.
4* PWM interface should NOT be available in sysfs.
As soon as you will have confirmed that everything worked as expected,
Jonas and I will provide a patch adding a pwm polarity reconfiguration
module parameter for you to test. This should give you access to the PWM
features of your it87 chip again, but in a safe way for a change ;)
Thanks,
