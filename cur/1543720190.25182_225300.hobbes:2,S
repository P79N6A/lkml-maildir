The correct URL still is:
	
http://www.ia64-linux.org/
Please update the URL.
grundler <512>host www.ia64-linux.org
www.ia64-linux.org has address 192.25.206.7
192.25.206.7 also hosted parisc-linux.org.
But recently all the parisc-linux services migrated to another box.
I'm not sure when/why the "old" box was disconnected or
if it just crashed.
In any case, despite being at gcc-summit conf, willy did find time to
migrate ia64-linux.org to the same host as parisc-linux.org.
IIRC, that was yesterday. The DNS just hasn't propagated yet
but ISTR willy said it would today at some point.
The entire ia64-linux web site is available via anon CVS.
See cvs.parisc-linux.org but use "ia64-web" instead as
the repository.
I've checked out a snapshot anyone can access for now on
