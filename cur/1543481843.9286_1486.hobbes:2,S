Please reply directly bcoz i am currently not on linux-kernel mailing list.
Please water the flames bcoz as an os nt is not bad (what with VMS as its 
base?)!

i think author didnot mean processes in wait state.

that was precisely the doubt i had. which were cleared on list earlier that 
for most of funcitons now 2.2version has finer grained  locks. some places 
like in network control still single lock exists so may not show good 
concurrency but lower latency times overall prevent any of these from being 
a limitation per se.

what about the kernel threads? what all core processes/threads are needed 
for process and device management apart from Scheduler? could someone 
please throw light on it.
does linux have kernel multithreads, instead of just user multithreads, 
some thing like light weight processes on Solaris (each process can have 
multiple kernel threads to schedule on and multiple user threads to perform 
tasks).
