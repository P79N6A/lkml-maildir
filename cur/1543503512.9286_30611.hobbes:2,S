A program with --x--x--x permissions can be read by anyone wielding
LD_PRELOAD, because ldso can't get an accurate dumpable reading so it has to
guess and it doesn't guess that case. So this is a worthy security fix
regardless of capabilities. (Assuming the ldso maintainers are willing to
make use of it)
Do we really need to wait for 2.4 to have permissions that work right?
