Hmm, isn't <0>, <1> etc used to encode the printk level in the string
though?
#define KERN_EMERG      "<0>"   /* system is unusable                   */
#define KERN_ALERT      "<1>"   /* action must be taken immediately     */
#define KERN_CRIT       "<2>"   /* critical conditions                  */
... etc ...
