I saw the same thing.  Poking around in 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/testing/patch-2.5.5.log,
I saw an entry where axboe@burns.home.kernel.dk fixed the
thread_saved_pc function, where this compilation problem was occuring.
I downloaded the 2.5.5-pre1 patch, applied it to 2.5.4, and compiled:
problem solved.  (Once other thing: ALSA didn't show up in my 'menuconfig'
display under Sound in 2.5.4, but it did in 2.5.5-pre1.)
