It has been discused before, it seems that the athlon needs another step 
to really enter in power saving mode, I can't remember the details, but 
I think it was a pci register, and I also remember that some people saw 
corrupts pci tranfer, namely the exact situation was grabbing with a TV 
card.
So the decision was that if this corrupted pci transfers from a tv card 
it could do the same with a pci ide controler, and that was not 
considered safe.
But you should crawl the archives for the same url.
