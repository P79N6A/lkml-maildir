It's in fact not so unique to FUSE.  It would equally well apply to
v9fs or even samba, since both want to allow unprvileged mounts, and
synthetic (or at least user-controlled) file serving.

If it's deliberate, than OK. 
However with suid/sgid, this is not a deliberate action of the user
under whose capabilities the process runs.  Neither in the case, when
it's a daemon doing some recursive directory traversal.
And it's not just peeking at the filesystem access patterns.  A much
more dangerous aspect is controlling _when_ an operation returns
(e.g. delaying it forever), and _what_ it returns (e.g. huge
files/directories).
Of course, this is only truly relevant for systems with untrusted
users.  But I do want to make FUSE work securely in those cases too.
For the single user system, the sysadmin can turn this feature off,
and be done with it.

We could.  But that would again be overly restrictive.  The goal is to
make the use of FUSE filesystems for users as simple as possible.  If
the user has to manage multiple namespaces, each with it's own
restrictions, it's becoming a very un-user-friendly environment.
Thanks,
