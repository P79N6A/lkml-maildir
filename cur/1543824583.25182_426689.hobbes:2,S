As outlined in the previous mail, you don't repost a primary adapter
that has already been posted. Adapters should only get posted once.
Laptop adapters are always primary. However, you may need access to
the shadow ROM copy to get info out of it and to run non-post
functions.
A missing sysfs ROM entry is probably a bug. There is a quirk in
arch/i386 that detects shadow video ROMs and tracks the primary video
adapter. It probably needs some special case code added for your
chipset. You're the first report of it being missing. Since I don't
have your laptop you'll need to debug this yourself. It shouldn't be
hard, it is a tiny piece of code.
The ROM attribute feature is not well tested on all platforms since
not much of the user space code that should be using it hasn't been
changed yet.
