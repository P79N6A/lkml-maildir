I have an SMP machine (Epox D3VA, 2xPIII/933) which needs "noapic" boot
or it fails to read the "partition check" (lost interrupt). It is this
way since 2.4.8 and around 2.4.9-ac12 I checked and it had the same
problem. The problem is 100% reproducible.
I believe there are still some problems with apic even on SMP. Maybe
only on some mobos?
