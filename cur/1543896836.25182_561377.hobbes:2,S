I understood.
AFAIK, it is common to propagate this via a special
bus cycle. Section 5.1.5.2.1 of the PowerPC manual
states that this is so. Secion 5.1.5.2 lists the requirements
for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor. Note that
Linux uses the coherent memory model for PowerPC SMP.
See also the "icbi" instruction description, where the use
of an address-only broadcast is mentioned.

A previous trampoline would ruin that.
Fortunately, PowerPC is not as brain-dead as ARM and IA64.
(not that I'm writing code for any of these)
