225kpps * 64 Bytes (minimum packet len) = 13,7 MBytes / sec
100 MBit / 8 bit = 12,5 MBytes / sec
So, IMHO even with a small packet saturated 100 MBit link you won't
reach 225kpps. AFAIK this was Ciscos intention to publish this number.
It basically says "you will have filled your link before you fill our
router". 
I'm pretty sure that your 37xx won't do any routing updates anymore at
this point. And if you do _anything_ that forces the packets down the
slow path from the routing engine, you're toast anyway.
But I'm pretty sure that a C37xx would handle full 100 MBit traffic to a
busy website without any problems. In fact, I know that it does. ;-) (We
did switch to a C12000 shortly after, mainly because we went Gigabit).
