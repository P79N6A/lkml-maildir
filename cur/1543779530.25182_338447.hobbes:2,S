The big difference between s390 and your standard architecture is that
s390 keeps the dirty and reference bits in the storage key. That is
per physical page and not per mapping. The primitive pte_dirty() just
doesn't make any sense for s390. A pte never contains any information
about dirty/reference state of a page. The "page" itself contains it,
you access the information with some instructions (sske, iske & rrbe)
which get the page frame address as parameter.

Urg, depending on the pte type there are no bits available. For valid ptes
there are some bits we could use but it wouldn't be nice.
