If the mount is disappearing, then it sounds like something has
come along and done a "umount".  That something is likely to
be Amd in this case.
The Linux autofs does support the NIS maps. We've got autofs
running on the Linux system in our lab - and it handily mounts
our home directories as we log in (our auto.home has 12,000 entries).
