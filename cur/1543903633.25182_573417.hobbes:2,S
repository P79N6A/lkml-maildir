Ok, I didn't have a chance to get through anywhere near all of it, but
here's my comments so far.  I didn't really go through things in any
particular order but most of these comments are about your drbd_int.h
header file.  Hopefully a lot of the comments will be useful to fix
similar/identical problems in your C files.
First of all, if you could break this up into chunks (even if they
aren't useful individually) just to make it easier to review.
Divisions like "This code does on-disk bitmap management", and "This
code does network protocol encoding/decoding" would be extremely
helpful when digging through this stuff.  I ended up only really doing
a cursory review for low-level/style issues, since without the bigger
picture (and without the fixed style issues and macro cleanups) it's
very hard to really give a good high-level review.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett

Don't use signals between kernel threads, use proper primitives like
notifiers and waitqueues, which means you should also probably switch away
from kernel_thread() to the kthread_*() APIs.  Also you should fix this
FIXME or remove it if it no longer applies:-D.

Just delete PARANOIA_BUG_ON and convert the above to a straight BUG_ON()

No more custom debugging macros please, we have plenty of standardized ones
in the kernel already (and all togther too many nonstandardized ones).
Please take a good look at dev_printk, etc to make some of your printk()s
shorter, but don't add more icky macros.  Also gcc < 3.1 is now unsupported,
so please remove gcc-2.95 portability comments/cruft (although in this case
the code itself doesn't need changing, just the comments).

We have some existing failure-injection code, any chance you could rip out
your custom logic and just plug that?  I haven't looked over it, though, so
I can't really offer any useful suggestions about it.

Your div_ceil function looks OK but I think we already have a standard one
somewhere.  You might remove that div_floor function, though, as it isn't
used anywhere.

Why not just open-code "WARN_ON_SMP(!spin_is_locked(lock))" in the few places
this is used?  Alternatively if you need this to actually BUG(), you might
either add a BUG_ON_SMP() to include/asm-generic/bug.h or add a helper to
include/linux/spinlock.h:
#if defined(CONFIG_SMP) && defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK)

SET_MDEV_MAGIC is only used in one place, can't you open-code it there?  Even
if it were used lots of places a little inline function would handle the
"typecheck" for you and be easier to read.  The IS_VALID_MDEV() isn't used
anywhere, so delete it.

Eww, please don't do opencoded casting of these.  You should use the proper
container_of() macro instead:
> struct foo {
>         int a;
> };
> struct bar {
>         int b;
>         struct foo thefoo;

>         process_a_bar(mybar);
> }
It's not *much* better typechecking, but it's at least a little.  It also
lets you put a struct drbd_work at a non-zero offset inside of some other
struct, as container_of() does internal subtraction of the offsetof().

The only light at the end of this tunnel is the greedily burning fires of
Macro Hell(TM).  Isn't there any better way to do this than all those horrid
macros?  I can sorta see what drbd_nl.h is trying to do, but the way it's
included multiple times with all those insane macros defined makes it really
hard to mentally parse.

Any reason this can't be open-coded?  The extra unlock logic should just be
moved into the cleanup handlers for the appropriate function.  It looks like
you are using the semaphore as a simple binary mutex, so please switch this
to "struct mutex" as well.

Yuck.  Definitely use PAGE_SIZE here, so at least if it's broken on an arch
with multiple page sizes, somebody can grep for PAGE_SIZE to fix it.  It also
means that on archs/configs with 8k or 64k pages you won't waste a bunch of
memory.

Yuck, why'd you do it this way?  Probably because your tcp_sk(sock->sk) stuff
doesn't have proper locking, I'll bet.  You can avoid all the extra wrapper
crap by just looking in "do_tcp_setsockopt" and taking the appropriate lock:
static inline void drbd_tcp_cork(struct socket *sock)
{
	struct sock *sk = sock->sk;
	lock_sock(sk);
	tcp_sk(sk)->nonagle |= TCP_NAGLE_CORK;
	release-sock(sk);
}
On the other hand, none of the currently in-tree network block devices or
network filesystems seem to feel the need to try to TCP_CORK their output, 
why does drbd?

This would be better implemented in the mutex/semaphore generic code, instead
of stuffed in a network blockdev.  On the other hand, since the only user is
this:

Can't you just either get rid of the check or open-code it?  It would also
give you a chance to substitute D_ASSERT(foo) for a proper BUG_ON(!foo) :-D

What is the PARANOIA flag intended to verify?  This needs better commenting
or removal.  Don't use macros which take implicit arguments (IE: the lc
value is used in the macro without it being passed as a parameter).  Since
it's debugging code you could also replace the open-coded bit trylock with a
blocking spinlock.  If something hangs, just turn on lockdep and it will
report *MUCH* more useful information about the deadlock.  Macros which do a
"return" are discouraged, but since this one is called RETURN() it might be
OK.  On the other hand, you should probably rename it as PARANOIA_RETURN().

Problematic spaces and parentheses.  Again, see Documentation/CodingStyle
for the preferred forms.  On the other hand, sometimes little code-style
things like that are left to the maintainer if they really strongly prefer
it one particular way.
