Well what matters is the code and development. I don't think Ingo's
scheduler is the final word, although I worry that Linus might jump the
gun and merge something "just to give it a test", which we then get
stuck with :P
I don't know how anybody can think Ingo's new scheduler is anything but
a good thing (so long as it has to compete before being merged). And
that's coming from someone who wants *their* scheduler to get merged...
I think mine can compete ;) and if it can't, then I'd rather be using
the scheduler that beats it.

If something is using more than a fair share of CPU time, over some macro
period, in order to be interactive, then definitely it should get throttled.
I've always maintained (since starting scheduler work) that the 2.6 scheduler
is horrible because it allows these cases where some things can get more CPU
time just by how they behave.
Glad people are starting to come around on that point.
So, on to something productive, we have 3 candidates for a new scheduler so
far. How do we decide which way to go? (and yes, I still think switchable
schedulers is wrong and a copout) This is one area where it is virtually
impossible to discount any decent design on correctness/performance/etc.
and even testing in -mm isn't really enough.
