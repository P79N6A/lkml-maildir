I think it would be great to have this for ext3. Andrew Morton has done
a lot of work to make ext3 very usable for MTA applications.
Postfix/qmail use 'find' either in their control script or whilst
providing queue statistics. Your optimisations would greatly speed these
operations up. I believe tarring directory trees might also get a
speedup and maybe cvs operations
