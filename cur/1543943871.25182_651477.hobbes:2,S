Hi Andrew,

Nothing guarantees it in general. However, at least most hwmon drivers
avoid accessing the Super-I/O configuration space after driver
initialization, which happens when the module is loaded. As module
loading is serialized, this limits the risk of concurrent access.
This is however a limitation I'd be happy to get rid of. It would be
nice to be able to access some configuration space registers at
run-time (e.g. VID readings).

You probably want to discuss this with Jim Cromie and Hans de Goede
(Cc'd.) They have been discussing a possible implementation in October
2007 on the lm-sensors list:
