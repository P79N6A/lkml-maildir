I considered a pte_user_read()/pte_user_write()-like approach, but
rejected it.  First of all, it doesn't really help with execute-only
pages.  Of course, we could add a pte_user_exec() and treat those
pages as readable, but that's not a good solution: just because we
want to make the gate page readable via ptrace() doesn't mean that we
want _all_ execute-only pages to be readable (it wouldn't make a
difference today, but I'm worried about someone adding other
execute-only pages further down the road, not being aware that
ptrace() would cause a potential security problem).
For ia64, I think we really want to say: if it's accessing the gate
page, allow reads.  There is just no way we can infer that from
looking at the PTE itself.
Is there really a point in allowing other FIXMAP pages to be read via
ptrace() on x86?
