With regard to your parens checking code, I re-wrote from a broken 
version, about 20 years ago, a utility to check all that.  I used it on 
the coco/os9 systems at the time, then built it for the amiga, and 
rebuilt it for linux a few years back.  It checks brackets, quotes in " 
style and ' style and ;, etc stuff.  I called mine cntx, and I've used it 
occasionally here, but haven't had the need/urge to test any kernel code 
with it so far.
If anyone is interested, and the list will take attachments of that 
nature, I'd be honored to share it.  What say you all?
