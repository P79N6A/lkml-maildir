You seem to have independent reached the same conclusion I did :)
To be specific, SCSI provides LLD infrastructure that block does not:
1) infrastructure for queueing, retrying, and timing out requests
2) an error handling thread.
3) a standard method of addressing attached devices
4) a standard method of submitting raw commands from userspace
It is my goal to shift this infrastructure from SCSI to block over time. 
  There is a fair amount of queueing infrastructure now in 2.6 (part of 
#1), and Jens already has test code for #4.
I had hoped to start working on this in 2.7, but with the new dev model 
2.7 is postponed indefinitely....  so I guess I'll start working on it 
sooner rather than later :)
