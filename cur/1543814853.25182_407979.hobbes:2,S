It was caught by:
timeval_to_jiffies(const struct timeval *value)
{
        unsigned long sec = value->tv_sec;
        long usec = value->tv_usec;
        if (sec >= MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES)
sec = MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES;
....
}
The conversion of long to unsigned long converted a negative value to
the maximum timeout.
It's not utterly insane, but it does not make much sense either.
Of course I can convert it that way, if we want to keep this "help
sloppy programmers aid" alive.
