Yes, it's the right change.  Changes to page_cache_size always
occur at the same time as changes to the per-zone accounting.
So the locking is shared and it all nestles nicely.
In the longer-term we don't want that atomic_t either.  We
need to avoid global and even per-zone atomic_t's and locks.

I currently have:
+extern struct page_state {
+       unsigned long nr_dirty;
+       unsigned long nr_locked;
+       unsigned long nr_pagecache;
+} ____cacheline_aligned page_states[NR_CPUS];
+
+extern void get_page_state(struct page_state *ret);
