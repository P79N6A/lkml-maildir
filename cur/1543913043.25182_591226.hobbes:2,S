It is not only about booting the system without MMCONFIG, it is also
about using the system. For this PCI ECS CF8 access is needed. So why
not adding support for this? Excluding major parts of CPU registers
when using CF8 base access only will cause writing code to workaround
this. Not very nice to handle.
