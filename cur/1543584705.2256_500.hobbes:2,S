I've noticed this as well in my logs.  In linux/include/net/tcp.h,
TCP_DEBUG is turned on; in linux/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c,
tcp_ack_update_window() contains the following:
#ifdef TCP_DEBUG
<snip>
printk(KERN_DEBUG "TCP: peer %u.%u.%u.%u:%u/%u shrinks window %u:%u:%u. Bad, what else can I say?\n",
                               NIPQUAD(sk->daddr), htons(sk->dport), sk->num,
                               tp->snd_una, tp->snd_wnd, tp->snd_nxt);
<snip>
#endif
Is it really necessary for TCP_DEBUG to be turned on by default?

"... being a Linux user is sort of like living in a house inhabited
