This most definitely works if you get the buffer_heads right.
brw_page() manages just fine with its own temporary buffer_heads,
created with create_buffers() and initialised with init_buffer().  All
swap and paging use that method.  The ext3/jfs journaling code and the
raw IO code both create temporary buffer_heads for IO bypassing the
buffer cache.

If you are  trying to use temporary buffer_heads for this, then you are
already on the right track.
