try this for me:
  (block) + (block >> hash_bits) + (block >> hash_bits * 2)
where hash_bits is computed the same way as it is computed for other
functions like the page cache hash.  the "* 2" shift will be zero for all
but the largest disks.

the reason the buffer cache size is probably not important is because the
buffer, these days anyway, contains mostly data that is waiting to be
written out.  data that is cached for reading is stored in the page cache,
so allowing that to grow is preferred.
what may affect system performance during memory shortages is how the
inode and dentry caches are pruned.  i've noticed that most dentries are
on the unused list, which grows to be a significant number during any
decent system load.
