Subject: [GIT PATCH] More core patches for 2.6.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/2/599

Here are some more driver core patche for 2.6.21.
They contain:
	- fix a problem with blowing up the stack in ugly ways.
	- compile warning fix
	- documentation update
	- remove 'struct subsystem' from the tree as it's pointless.  It
	  only contained one field, a struct kset, and was confusing to
	  everyone who ever had to use it.  This sets the stage for
	  further cleanups to the driver and kobject core to be much
	  saner and easier to understand.
The 'struct subsystem' removal patch has been in -mm for quite some
time, the others are all "obviously correct" :)
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
