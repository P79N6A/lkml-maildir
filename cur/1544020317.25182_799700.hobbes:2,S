Hi,
Is it possible to kill a kernel thread from user space. Don't ask me
why do I need to do this. This is purely an experimental exercise, I
am not doing it because I am working on a practical problem. Thing is
that I wrote a kernel module and now it is hung in a kernel thread
somewhere doing udelay(), fortunately since I am on preemptible kernel
 my machine is not frozen,
but still I saw that doing a kill -9 on this process has no effect.
How about if I insert another kernel module and kill this busywait
thread from inside the kernel space. In effect how do you execute
"kill -9" from one kernel thread to misbehaving kernel thread.
thanks.
george
