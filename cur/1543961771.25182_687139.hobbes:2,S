What error did you get with this?

Taking a quick look,
	CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=y
	CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON=y
	# CONFIG_VIDEO_ALLOW_V4L1 is not set
	CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT=y
seems strange.  VIDEO_ALLOW_V4L1 should have been selected since
drivers/media/video/Kconfig contains the following:
	config VIDEO_V4L1
		tristate
		depends on VIDEO_DEV && VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON && VIDEO_ALLOW_V4L1
		default VIDEO_DEV && VIDEO_V4L2_COMMON && VIDEO_ALLOW_V4L1
I guess the remaining reverse-selection caused this.
thanks,
Takashi
