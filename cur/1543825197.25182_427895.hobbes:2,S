On bttv and other boards, were we have such conflicts, we have an option
to specify what board is used (called card). When the driver locates a
board without PCI subvendor ID, it shows a help msg at dmesg and exits
(or load a generic handler). The user may then use card=xx (where xx is
the number of the board). IMHO, this is the better for saa7146 boards.
