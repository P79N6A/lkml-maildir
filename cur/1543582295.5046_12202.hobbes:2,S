Not especially.  In cases you can't optimize pointers become tuples
of <pointer to the array, pointer one past the end of the array, real pointer>.

Huh?  Pointers and arrays are clearly different at the ABI level.
A pointer is a word that contains an address of something.
An array is an array.
There is an implicit promotion from one to the other at the source level,
but that has little to do with the application binary interface.

No, it's more of a large mechanical job than truly hard problem.
The real challenge lies in optimizing out the checks so you don't penalize
the inner loops of code.
