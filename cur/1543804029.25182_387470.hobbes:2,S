Ok then, let's go ahead, but 
I vote for config exclusion as a first step,
so if anybody will run into problems, will use old mature stuff until e100 get fixed.
Due to rollback the removed driver - back and forth in killing/resurrecting stuff is not a good example to follow within the kernel.
Generally speaking, e100 should replace eepro*, but I can see no reason for rush in doing that one-step.
