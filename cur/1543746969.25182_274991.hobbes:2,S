> The problem with these (atomic.h
that is a very non portable header and there are several good
alternatives (see the apr library for example). In fact. atomic.h is
*dangerous* in userspace, it is only atomic if CONFIG_SMP is set, so if
you compile your app on a machine without that set and then run it on an
smp machine, you are not atomic.

xor.h is very raid specific (and GPL with lots of code, so a license
trap)
