I've now built a similar test program for Windows. I've let it run over 
2000 iterations of 512MB memsets with no problems. On Linux it usually 
blew up with under 200 iterations. It does run visibly slower than the 
Linux version though - this is after all 32 bit Windows and it was 
compiled with crufty old Visual C++ 6.0 so it is probably not that 
optimized for this CPU. I will see if I can get a more optimized build 
of this to try in Mingw32 or something.. after all if it's related to 
some instruction combination or something it may not show up in the 
build I have.
