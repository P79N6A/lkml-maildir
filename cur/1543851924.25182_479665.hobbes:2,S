I agree.  The problem isn't with rt_mutex.  It rt_mutex doesn't depend on
that condition to break out of the loop. That condition is an extra
condition that's there to stop in the case we timed out before the owner
released the lock. The real condition to break out of the loop is the
owner releasing the lock, and there's no known races there.
So the time out is what needs to make sure that rt_mutex sees the event.

Right! The changing of the condition isn't even in any spin lock. But that
condition needs be be completed before the changes done within the spin
lock, but unfortunately, the spin lock itself doesn't guarantee anything.

Correct, the solution should NOT change rt_mutex.  Your original patch is
the correct approach.
