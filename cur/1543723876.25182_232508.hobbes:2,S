The patch is mostly fine with me (it looks identical to me as the last
version I saw from Ray; but my memory may be fuzzy).
There are two minor things I'd like to see changed, though:
 - Use IS_IA32_PROCESS() instead of testing psr.is directly (the macro
   gets defined by system.h and using it ensures that the
   IA-32-specific code will go away if the ia32 subsystem is not
   compiled into the kernel).
 - Remove trailing white-space.
Thanks,
