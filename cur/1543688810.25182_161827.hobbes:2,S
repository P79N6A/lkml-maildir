Hi Andrea,
Above a certain connection rate, no amount of margin is enough.  The
connections are a SYN flood.
You need to take into account the peak rate, which varies from second
to second, due to simple statistics plus the tendency of the net to
make traffic burstier than it started.
Above a certain number of packets/sec, competing VoIP traffic degrades
- a little added latency is equivalent to dropping with VoIP.  That
translates to dropouts in the audio.  Acceptable for hackers talking
over a flakey line, but not corporate telephony.
At Larry's server, inbound connection rate resembles a low-level SYN
flood, which is enough to poke holes in VoIP latency.
Of course the real problem is lack of end to end QoS between Larry's
nodes.  Two T1s is just a workaround :)
