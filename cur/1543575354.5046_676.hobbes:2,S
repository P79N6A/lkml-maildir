Hi!
It is possible to remove swapfile in use. Great, but how do you swap
off then? Who is to blame?
root@bug:~# swapoff /tmp/swap
swapoff: /tmp/swap: No such file or directory
root@bug:~# > /tmp/swap
root@bug:~# swapoff /tmp/swap
swapoff: /tmp/swap: Invalid argument
root@bug:~#
How do I get out of this bad situation?
