Alexander also makes a simple wrong assumption in his comparison of
software and hypertext documents: Software must be logically
consistent and its writers highly inter-co-ordinated or it simply
won't work; a rough and non-linear post-modern web-accessible document
has no such internal communication requirement.  When you write a
screenplay like this, you get 3 academy award nominations; when you
write software like this, you get a cubicle in Redmond.
Oh, yes, I totally agree that it would be very nice to have tight
coherence throughout the document, but it is not strictly required.
Best regards.
