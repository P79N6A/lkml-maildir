Hello,
The kernel at samba.anu.edu.au/pub/linux-pmac/vmlinux does not boot this 
7200/75. This is a first! Furthermore, samba (src tarball) and vger 
2.1.130 sources compiled by myself also do not boot.  I even tried 
different compilers (egcs 1.0-2e and 1.1-1b).
The HD grunts, as usual, but no video. Unfortunately, I neither have a 
decent OF (so no video in OF), or a terminal to connect to a serial port 
to see what is happening.
All previous vger sources (via cvs) have successfully compiled and booted 
this box.
Since compilation takes over 30 mins, I am at a loss to know what I can 
do to help. Should I turn-off frame buffer stuff, for example, and try 
again?
Cheers,
Keith
