tty_poll() grabs ldisc reference for the tty it was called with;
however, in this case pty_chars_in_buffer() accesses another ldisc
(tty->link->ldisc) without grabbing a reference to it.  BTW, many other
pty_* functions do the same thing.
Is calling tty_ldisc_ref(tty->link) safe here?  There is a comment
warning about possible deadlocks before pty_write().
