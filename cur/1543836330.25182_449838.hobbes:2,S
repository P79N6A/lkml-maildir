I've been auditing tty code and its joyously bad but only in harmless
places so far except for one.
init_dev (and caller) relies on tty_mutex to ensure that the
driver->ttys list is protected from things going away.
release_mem() removes stuff from the said list and frees memory. It is
not always called under tty_mutex and that appears very dubious to me at
the moment although tty->closing and the BKL *might* be sufficient.
