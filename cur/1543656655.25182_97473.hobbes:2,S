Subject: 2.4.20: Broken AGP initialization for i845G chipset [patch]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Chipset detection for the new Intel i845G chipset was added into the AGPGART
driver, but it appears to call the wrong initialization routine.  Stock 
compile
causes some bad interaction that messes up the PCI bus such that, in my 
case,
the follow on initialization of the Adaptec SCSI card (PCI) hangs the 
box.  Needless
to say, that's very bad since that's where all the hard drives live. 
SCSI driver
initialization happens right after the AGP initialization... from dmesg 
(after my patch):
(without the patch, it would hang before "scsi0: Adaptec ..." or before 
finding
  any drives)
....

Patch below.  Calls the 845 initialization function instead of the 830MP,
and a small formatting cleanup.  This is verified working.
