No advantages, really.. except that it keeps suspend and resume paths
similar, and keeps the code simple. I'll want to call this from
userland and I'd hate to have two different calls or call with
parameter.

You may plug/unplug things that are hot-pluggable. If you do something
else (imagine adding or worse removing ram from the system), or do
something "interesting" (boot freebsd, mount ext3 partition,
...)... you loose your data.
