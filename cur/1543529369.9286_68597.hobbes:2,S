I must really be doing something wrong... I am trying to upgrade my RH 6.1
(Cartman) to a new kernel so that I can enable UDMA support.  I have tried
2.3.50 only to have errors in the make config so that make bzImage never
creates the file.  Which kernel version would be the best to use?
I have a AMD K7-650 (Athlon) with 256M ram and an IBM 352030 20.3G UDMA 66
