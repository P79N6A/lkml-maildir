They cache things like this:
open("/usr/lib/locale/de_DE+euro/LC_MEASUREMENT", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No 
such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib/locale/de_DE@euro/LC_MEASUREMENT", O_RDONLY) = 3
Thus they are not really useless, they are just not usefully limited.
Thus IMHO you should look at the swap out path.
