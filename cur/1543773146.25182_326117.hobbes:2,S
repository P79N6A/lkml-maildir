Hi folks,
My home box has onboard via-rhine NIC.
Several days ago my father called me and said that
it does not send anything (tcpdump shows only rx'ed pkts
despite pings being attempted etc). I did not investigate
then.
Yesterday I've seen it myself. I bumped up ethtool msglvl.
Looks like via-rhine's hard_start_xmit was not called at all
from network core code! (I did not see debug printks from
rhine's hard_stat_xmit routine)
Whatever I tried (ifconfig down/up, reinit IP config from scratch),
nothing helped. No tx whatsoever was attempted by kernel, it seems.
Reboot 'fixed' things.
It hever happened on the same hardware before I switched to rc5.
