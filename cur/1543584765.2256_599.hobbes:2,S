Hi,
I wrote brief document describing porting 2.2 device driver to 2.4
It contains changes from 2.2 to 2.4 including devfs, /proc, block device
driver, etc.
I'm not a kernel hacker, so there may be errors due to my
misunderstanding.
I'd be grateful if anyone points out and corrects the errors, and my
poor english if possible :-).
And I'd be very grateful if anyone appends more explanation,
and complements it by supplementing what I omitted.
I will greately appreciate any message about this.
