Isn't better to ask why there is a problem with the /'s?  It would be
bad for Linux as a design to prevent passing arbitrary tail ends of
filenames off to arbitrary plugins of some kind.  In general, in
namespace design, you want to allow delegating the job of
resolving/interpreting the tail end of a file that the front end has
identified as something that can interpret it.
Forgive me, I probably understand something wongly about procfs and this
issue....
