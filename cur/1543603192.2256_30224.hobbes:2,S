Setting the coredumpsize limit to 0 already solves the problem.
The question that remains is how to deal with nested locks on the same
resource that can lead to deadlocks. Is there any (un)written rule that
one should avoid them in the Linux Kernel? Or are there any approaches to
deal with them (which are not yet included in the Kernel)?

Do these solutions deal only with the coredump problem or with nested
critical sections?
Thanks,
Erich
