I have to agree. I don't ever recall using GDB to debug my own code, and I'm
half-willing to accept the testosterone-fuelled position on that case, but
in the cases where I'm supposed to be 'certifying' or otherwise debugging
code which is provided by a customer, but which appears to have been written
by a crack-smoking hobo they dragged in off the street, it's been _very_
useful.
