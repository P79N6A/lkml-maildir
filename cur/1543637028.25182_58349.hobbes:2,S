Have those officially been assigned to SCSI disks?
So disks 128 -- 255 have majors 128 thr. 135?

I've written a patch for sd that makes the allocation of majors
dynamic. The driver just takes 8 at sd_init and further majors are 
allocated when disks are attached. Which saves a lot of memory for
all the gendisk and hd_struct stuff in case you do not have a lot of 
SCSI disks connected. The patch does support up to 160 SD majors, 
though currently, it won't succeed getting more than 132 majors.

Indeed. I missed the sysrq stuff in my patch, BTW. 
Do you have any idea why we can't just sync all mounted filesystems
in do_emergency_sync()? Or at least all that are backed by a real 
device? The test for IDE and SCSI majors seems bogus to me. What
about DASD? LVM? EVMS? MD? Loop? NBD? DRBD? What's the rationale 
of restricting the sync to only IDE and SCSI? Deadlock avoidance?

It's right. Kill them! I killed them as well in my patch.

I'm gonna post my patches tomorrow ...
