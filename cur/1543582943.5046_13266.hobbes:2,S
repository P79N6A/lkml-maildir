	Then wouldn't it make sense to point Fabrizio at a known solution?
;-)
	Fabrizio: I'm going to guess that your problem might be the loop
lockups that have been part of late 2.3 and all 2.4.  Jenbs Axboe has some
patches that seem to fix the problem; see
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/2.4.2-pre4/
	The loop-6 patch there appears to apply to 2.4.2-ac1 and I
suspect will apply to 2.4.2 proper.
	Mohammed: is there another problem or fix of which I'm not aware?
	Cheers,
	- Bill
