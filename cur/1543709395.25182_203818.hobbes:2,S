What is your exact goal ? Not resuming all devices when writing the
state to the swap partition ?
You really need to resume it all at this point. However, the optimisation
that can be done is for some drivers to not put the HW to sleep on a
swsusp transition, only freeze the state. I did something like that in
IDE though that doesn't always work well due our "state" paremeter passed
down to drivers not beeing consistent.
