I'm worried that the EDID we get from the monitor is bogus and needs to
be overriden.
Now, if the kernel builds a mode list, that's find if we have a call to
"feed" it with a replacement one later on from userland.
In addition, there are all those monitors that cannot be probed (no
DDC/EDID) and for which only userland can reasonably provide a mode or a
mode list.
So it's a bit of both :-) Building an "initial" mode list from the EDID
might be fair enough if we can replace it soon enough, but we still need
to be very conservative about whatever boot mode we choose.

Well, I've seen my share of broken EDID.. Last time I looked at Darwin,
I think I saw Apple maintaining a fairly huge database of EDID replacements
in userland...
