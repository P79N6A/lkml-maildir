When you link the lot together they can all go in one section too.  The
order will be preserved, no need for extra symbols.
But perhaps priorities are just plain wrong -- in many cases, it's
specific interdependencies that need to be addressed.  Shoving those
dependencies (by name) into the initcall section and doing a topological
sort they'd be sorted, as it were.
