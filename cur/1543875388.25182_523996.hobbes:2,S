Memory is a machine-wide resource, not a per-queue resource.
If we have hit the dirty+writeback limit, it is logical to throttle
dirtiers until the levels subside.

It is related, but this observation doesn't actually strengthen your
argument.  If memory is full of dirty-or-writeback pages against a USB
drive, we don't want to go letting writers to other devices go and dirty
even more memory.  We instead need to clamp down harder on the writer to
the USB drive.

You mean that someone is stuck in balance_dirty_pages() against the lower
fs while holding locks which prevent writes into the upper fs from
succeeding?
Draw us a picture ;)

The queue congestion thing is meaningless, and I ignored it.

David is overoptimistic ;)
Two scsi disks on a 256MB machine will put us over the edge, and that's
even before the user has gone and fiddled with the knobs.
Then there's NFS which for a long time had basically unbounded queue
lengths.  That's allegedly been fixed, but I haven't seen testing results
which convince me of that.
Then there's CIFS, SMBFS, v9fs, DM, MD, whatever.  Plenty of things in
there which can screw things up.
