The most common driver issues I see involve:
- USB being built in or as modules that are still loaded while
suspending (getting better, but not there yet)
- DRI being used in X where the drivers don't properly support
suspend/resume (NVidia esp)
- Firewire
- CPU Freq  (improving too)
It might be good to mention these areas too.
Perhaps the 'changing your hardware' could mention that replacing faulty
hardware may be safe.

Evolution.
Enumerate the requirements.
Consider the interdependencies.
Calculate the probabilities.
