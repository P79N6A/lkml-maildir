On a fresh object dir I get for a 32bit build:
make -C /home/lsrc/quilt/linux O=/home/lsrc/quilt/obj32 
  GEN     /home/lsrc/quilt/obj32/Makefile
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
  Using /home/lsrc/quilt/linux as source for kernel
  CALL    /home/lsrc/quilt/linux/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 1 modules
make[3]: Nothing to be done for `vmlinux'.
KBUILD_IMAGE := arch/x86/boot/bzImage
make[2]: KBUILD_IMAGE: Command not found
make[2]: *** [all] Error 127
make[1]: *** [sub-make] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
I think it worked on older object dirs where not everything was rebuild.
make --version
GNU Make 3.81
