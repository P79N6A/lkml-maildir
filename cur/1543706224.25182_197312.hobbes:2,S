Starting with 2.6.3-rc1-mm1, nfsd isn't working any more. Exportfs just hangs.
Previous version (2.6.2-mm1) worked fine.
Reverting the following patches makes it work again:
nfsd-01-schedule-in-spinlock-fix.patch
nfsd-02-ip_map_init-kmalloc-check.patch
nfsd-03-sunrpc-cache-init-fixes.patch
nfsd-04-convert-proc-to-seq_file.patch
nfsd-05-no-procfs-build-fix.patch
You can find my .config here:

You can find an strace of the nfsd server startup as well as a sysrq-t capture here:

System is a Dell 2650 SMP (ia32), running Debian Sid.
Thanks,
Philippe
