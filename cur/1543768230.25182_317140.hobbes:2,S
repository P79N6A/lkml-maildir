There's plenty of documentation on how to use 'make' to build an
out-of-tree .ko.

First, describe the semantics.  How the <bleep> is that ever "supposed to work"?
automangle and friends are designed so you can configure userspace programs to
run no matter what oddities the underlying system has.  Kconfig is for actually
describing the underlying system.
At *best*, all you could do is use the .config variables to answer some of
the "is XYZ present?" tests done in ./configure - but even *that* is Pigheaded
And Wrong, because it will get it wrong if you're pulling hints from a kernel
tree that doesn't match the running kernel, or if it's a new-ish feature that
requires userspace library support that isn't installed on the system...
