Dear Sir, 
My name is CEDIA D.ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH 
ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located 
in the South East Asia. 
My husband was recently impeached from office by a 
backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. 
My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on 
charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the 
mysterious 
charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. 
The present government is forcing my husband out of 
manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. 
During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, 
I realized some reasonable amount of money from 
various deals that I successfully executed. I have 
plans to invest this money for my children's future on real 
estate and industrial production. My husband is not 
aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for 
now. 
Before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned 
the sum of $30,000,000 million USD 
(Thirty million United states dollars) out of 
Philippines and deposited the money with a security 
firm that transports valuable goods and consignments 
through diplomatic means. I also declared that the 
consignment was solid gold and my foreign business 
partner owned it. 
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the 
security company and claim the money on my behalf 
since I have declared that the consignment belong to 
my foreign business partner. You shall also be 
required to assist me in investment in your country. 
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will 
not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me 
properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of 
the total money you will take for your assistance. 
When I receive your positive response I will let you 
know where the security company is 
and the payment pin code to claim the money which is 
very important. 
For now, let all our communication is by e-mail 
because my line are right now connected to the 
Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please 
also send me your telephone and fax number. 
I will ask my son contact you to give you more details 
on after i have received a responce from you.
Thank you and God bless you and family. 
MRS CEDIA ESTRADA
