Jeff,
just as a hint: I do have a SiS based UP test system around that 
misbehaves with IO-APIC enabled.
See 
http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/slim_pc/slm/pro_slm_detail.php?UID=134&MODEL=MS-6232
 
  for more system details.
 From the back of my head: with IO-APIC enabled and 3 RTL8139 (one on 
board, the other two PCI) the NICs get assigned IRQs 17 and 18 but don't 
seem to receive any interrupt at all. Without IO-APIC all three NICs 
share IRQ 11 and do work. Further details on request (very low priority 
problem for me). Oh, nearly forgot: kernel is 2.4.20rc1.
