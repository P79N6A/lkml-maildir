I tried on SuSE 9.2 and 9.3 and it didn't work.
After a short investigation based on your info, this is what came out:
On SuSE 9.2, it's because it is still using a 3.x autofs.
On SuSE 9.3, it's because it doesn't work with the --ghost option in the 
auto.x NIS map file. It works only if I put the option in the 
/etc/sysconfig/autofs global settings.
Thanks for your help!
