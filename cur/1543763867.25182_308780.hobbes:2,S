Uhh, no.  stdint.h is part of glibc, not the kernel.

You miss the point of size_t and ssize_t/ptrdiff_t.  They are types
guaranteed to be at least as big as the pointer size.  uint8/16/32/64,
on the other hand, are specific bit-sizes, which may not be as fast or
correct as a simple size_t.  Linus has pointed out that while it
doesn't matter which of __u32, u32, uint32_t, etc you use for kernel
private interfaces, you *cannot* use anything other than __u32 in the
parts of headers that userspace will see, because __u32 is defined
only by the kernel and so there is no risk for conflicts, as opposed
to uint32_t, which is also defined by libc, resulting in collisions
in naming.
