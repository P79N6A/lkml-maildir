Subject: [PATCH] remove fsuser()

Linus,
Apparently nothing uses fsuser() - else I would of just stuck this on
the end the last patch...
This patch removes fsuser().  Now both suser() and fsuser() are gone and
all permission checks use an appropriate capable() call.
Patch is against 2.5.20 + previous suser() removal patch.  Please apply.
