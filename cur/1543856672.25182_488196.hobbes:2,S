That 2GB machine apparently has a 1.6GB shm segment which is mlocked.  That will
cause the VM to do one heck of a lot of pointless scanning and could, I guess,
cause false oom decisions.  It's also an ia32 highmem machine, which adds to the
fun.
We could scan more:

but that's rather dumb.  Better would be to remove mlocked pages from the
LRU.
