Happy thanksgiving.  I'm having trouble with the PDC20262 driver in the
2.3.29 kernel (and pre-3.30-1 patch).  When it tries to probe the
partitions on my second drive, I get the following:
hde: hde: timeout waiting for DMA
hde: irq timeout: statux = 0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
and then hangs.
I'm running kernel 2.3.25 with no problem, here's the info from
that kernel:
PDC20262: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
PDC20262: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20262: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0x10c0-0x10c7, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:DMA
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0x10c8-0x10cf, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
hde: WDC AC29100D, 8693MB w/1966kB Cache, CHS=17662/16/63, UDMA(66)
 
hde: [PTBL] [1108/255/63] hde1 hde2 hde3 hde4 < hde5 hde6 >
Let me know if you need anything else.
