Has it been hot where you are lately? Is your fan working? 
Hardware that acts up under load is quite often thermal-related, 
especially if it starts happening during summer and didn't happen before 
that... ESPECIALLY the kinds of behaviours you see: the "sudden power-off" 
is the normal behaviour for a CPU that trips a critial overheating point, 
and the slowdown is also one normal response to overheating (CPU 
throttling).
