Sorry? I could have simply told you to look into kernel/signal.c LINE
220 (that's in the recalc_sigpending_tsk() function), to see that
THERE IS code which uses /^\t+\x20/ to indent wrapped if continuation
lines:
fastcall void recalc_sigpending_tsk(struct task_struct *t)
{
	if (t->signal->group_stop_count > 0 ||
	    (freezing(t)) ||
	    PENDING(&t->pending, &t->blocked) ||
	    PENDING(&t->signal->shared_pending, &t->blocked))
		set_tsk_thread_flag(t, TIF_SIGPENDING);
	else
		clear_tsk_thread_flag(t, TIF_SIGPENDING);
}
And this is not the only function. But since I figured you would
anyway object despite what I say...

code. Whether that invalidates what CodingStyle says is another
debate (which at best Randy just decides and sends a patch for which
is then hopefully committed instantly).

I was never debating these two things. I was, however, if you have
not noticed yet, about wrapped if lines:
	if (foo ||
	    continuation_with_2_or_more_spaces)
		code_with_1_tab;
and
	if (foo ||
			continuation_with_2_tabs)
		code_with_1_tab;
The former is what kernel code does "**TODAY**".
Thank you.
Jan
