Yes. As I sent another version after read your comment, I'll fix the V8 code just for this patch, ok? I don't see that 
we have to send another version.

This definition:
#define MMC_LOCK_MODE_UNLOCK    (0<<2)
also tries to make the code more clear and legible. It is indicating that this bit is on the position 3 into the bits 
array, according to MMC Spec.
But, why zero? Well, the bit must be 1 for locking and 0 for unlocking. We are using the unlocking action, so we used zero.
Is there any issue using this piece of code?
If you prefer another approach we can adjust our patch.
