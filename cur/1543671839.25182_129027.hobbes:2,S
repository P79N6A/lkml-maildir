No, it was correct. It simply means that some CPUs prefer bit shifting while
others prefer comparisons and sometimes jumps, that mostly depends on the
ALU and the branch prediction unit, it seems. That shows us that if we include
such code in the kernel, it has to be arch-specific, so we may end up coding
it in assembler, keeping your code as the default one when no asm has been coded
for a given arch. BTW, has someone benchmarked BSF/BSR on x86 ? It should be
faster, it it's also possible that a poor microcode implements it with a one
bit/cycle algo, which will result in one instruction not being as fast as your
code.
Cheers,
Willy
