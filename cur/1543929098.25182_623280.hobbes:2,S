Hi Vitaly,

If i understand your code correctly, you seem to rely on the fact 
that fixed_phy_add() is called before the fixed MDIO bus is scanned for 
devices. How is this supposed to work for modules or for the 
PPC_CPM_NEW_BINDING mode where the device tree is no longer scanned 
during fs_soc initialization but during device initialization?
I tried to add fixed-phy support to fs_enet, but the fixed phy is not 
found this way.
