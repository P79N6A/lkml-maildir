Couple of observations:
This doesn't actually need to be an O(n^2) operation. The result
of it is only going to be used in the sched domains code, so what
is really wanted is "how far away is one sched_group from another",
although we may also scale that based on the *amount* of cache
in the path between 2 cpus, that is often just a property of the
CPUs themselves in smaller systems, so also not O(n^2).
Secondly, we could use Ingo's O(n^2) code for the *SMP* domain on
all architectures (so in your case of only 2 CPUs per node, it is
obviously much cheaper, even over 256 nodes).
Then the NUMA domain could just inherit this SMP value as a default,
and allow architectures to override it individually.
This may allow us to set up decent baseline numbers, properly scaled
by cache size vs memory bandwidth without going overboard in
complexity (while still allowing arch code to do more fancy stuff).
