Does it need to do direct lookups by index?  I am under the impression
that the code simply iterates over the poll structures, perhaps with
back pointers, but I haven't actually read it :-)
You could use a table indirection scheme for speedy lookups: one page is
an array of pointers to the other pages.  If the indirection array is
very small, i.e. usually just 1 entry, you don't bother allocating the
indirection page.
enjoy,
