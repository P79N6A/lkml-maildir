Re-Ping?
This patch works (it has been working for months), is ACK'd by me, 
addresses some of the feedback given in August, and has not received any 
comments despite the SCSI maintainers being To'd or CC'd for weeks 
(months, if you include the older thread).
Further, this patch is required to round out interrupt-driven media 
change notification, that which eliminates the CD-ROM polling that 
userspace has done since the dawn of time.
It was not in the merge window SCSI push, while being in -mm for a while 
and linux-scsi having the patch for a while.  Which means, if the 
silence continues, it must wait 4-6 months for 2.6.25 release, for no 
apparent reason.
