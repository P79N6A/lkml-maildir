Hi,
I have an ABIT BP6 motherboard with two Celeron 466's. 
When I leave my computer on when I'm not home, I often come back to
find it hung. 
I've been running 2.2.12 for quite a while and thought I should't
report on something "old" like that, so I upgraded to 2.2.14pre2:
(which is mis-marked)
Linux version 2.2.14pre1 (wolff@cave) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 SMP Sat Oct 30 11:59:50 MEST 1999
Hmm... I'll try and get hold of gcc 2.7.2 to get this thing compiled,
and report again. It doesn't happen "easily", and I was almost at the
point where I was going to report "good work, 2.2.14pre2 fixes my
crashes....", when I found it crashed again.... 
Or is it likely that APM is kicking in, while in fact, I've got that
turned off in the BIOS. ("APM is not SMP safe, disabeling.", so I
completely disabled in the BIOS recently....)
Suggestions?
					Roger.
