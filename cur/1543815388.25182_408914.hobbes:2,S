Why this needs to be "pushed" upstream in the first place?  Isn't it
simpler/easier/whatever to just require klibc to be present on the
build system for kernel?  If klibc is "sufficiently" independent of
the kernel (is it?  I see no reason it shouldn't), why it should go
with kernel?  Just point your CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE to some klibc
directory tree and be done with it, no need to distribute/build
klibc with kernel..
Thanks.
