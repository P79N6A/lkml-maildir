Why?  It's a bit of a performance hit, but that doesn't matter here. 
probe_kernel_address() is semantically the right thing to be using;
open-coding its contents to avoid a few fairly cheap operations is a
backwards step.

My point is that "__get_user" doesn't make much semantic sense here:
we're not talking about usermode pages.  We used to use it quite often
for cases where an access may or may not fault, but now we spell that
"probe_kernel_address()".

I don't strongly object to using probe_kernel_address() for all ROM
memory accesses if it makes you feel happier, but I think putting an
open-coded implementation in here is definitely the wrong thing to do.
