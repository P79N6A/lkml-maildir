Yeah, this is a known problem and the patch has been on ALSA tree for
weeks, but it was never pushed.
Jaroslav, please please, prepare the push for 2.6.25 fixes.  It's
embarrassing to leave the fix patches without pushing to the upstream
for such a long time again...
At least, the following changesets should be pushed:
5808, 5809, 5810, 5811, 5812, 5813, 5814, 5815, 5816, 5818,
5826, 5828, 5831, 5840.
The patches 5844, 5845, 5846, 5847 should be also pushed but I'd like
to double-check these with testers before that.
thanks,
Takashi
