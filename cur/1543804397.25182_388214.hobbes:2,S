I just booted up 2.6.15-rt6 (PREEMPT_DESKTOP, regular soft and hard
irqs) on a 366 MHz UP machine with init=/bin/bash.  Loaded the e100
driver, setup the network. Then started to ping it from another box.  I
had a 80 usec latency, and that wasn't even from the network card.
So, e100 should not be a problem.  I did see the interrupts go off every
2 seconds too.
Check to see if you still get the latencies with e100 and the latest
kernel.
As Lee already said.  You notice something fishy __PLEASE__ report it.
Arjan's response was that this shows that we should only have one driver
for a certain task, otherwise people wont report a problem with one, if
the other satisfies their needs. And thus, the problem remains.
