-m16 is the right thing, and it also provides a proper hook for
eventually having a real 16-bit backend (there are at least two projects
for doing that.)
For now, I have:
CFLAGS          := $(LINUXINCLUDE) -g -Os -D_SETUP -D__KERNEL__ \
                   $(cflags-$(ARCH)) \
                   -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes \
                   -march=i386 -mregparm=3 \
                   -include $(srctree)/$(src)/code16gcc.h \
                   -fno-strict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer \
                   $(call cc-option, -ffreestanding) \
                   $(call cc-option, -fno-unit-at-a-time) \
                   $(call cc-option, -fno-toplevel-reorder) \
                   $(call cc-option, -fno-stack-protector) \
                   $(call cc-option, -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2)
... since that will require less violence to eventually hack in the
proper -m16 option if/when it becomes available.
