Maybe we can detect some of the cases with broken software, and
at least provide an option to turn the RockRidge inode numbers
off.

That can easily be solved. RockRidge inode numbers are multiplied
by two, and synthesized inode numbers are all odd. Of course if
the multiplication overflows a fallback to synthesized inode
numbers would be necesarry. Does any software produce inode
numbers large enough to make this a problem?

Agreed.

That problem can easily be solved. Simply use different methods
for zero-length files and all other files. But there might be
other problems with such an approach:
1) Could two different files have same data block pointer?
   (different sizes perhaps?)
2) Do we need a way to find metadata from the inode number?
