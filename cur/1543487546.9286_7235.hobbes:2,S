We must use his if you won't post yours.

You must be building your own motherboards, right? You can not make
honest promises with hardware that might frequently retry to hide
error conditions from the OS. The BIOS could even use a system management
mode to steal cycles.
I think this whole argument is silly. The goal should be "improve".
There is no perfection. Think in terms of histograms with infinitely
long tails that need to be squished as flat as possible. Every bit
of improvement is useful -- maybe Linux goes from 5000 ruined CDs/year
to 4352 ruined CDs/year. Good.
