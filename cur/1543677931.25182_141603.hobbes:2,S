The kernel would have to be substantially more complex to report all 
errors that could possibly be detected during queuing.  The kernel could 
even detect success during queuing if it really tried.
This is not a reasonable requirement.  A correctly written program has 
to be able to handle errors reported asynchronously.  Why else would 
they be using an asynchronous API?

So?  That is a miniscule amount of resources used by an extremely rare 
condition.  Such a picayune optimization hardly justifies the necessary 
increase in complexity.
