Hello all,
I sent this to linux-mm, but haven't gotten a response - hope it's OK to
send here.  I believe the set_page_count() macro is broken, and should
have parentheses around the 'v' in the second argument (otherwise more
complex arguments will break).  Here is a patch to 2.6.15 - I haven't
really tested it, but it looks simple enough.  Any objections?  Anything
else I need to do?
Thanks,
Avishay Traeger
