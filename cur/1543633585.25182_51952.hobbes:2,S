   If I understand both Davids correctly this is the solution.
   Buffers for dma must be allocated seperately using a special allocation
   function which is given the device so it can allocate correctly.
   David B wants a bus specific pointer to a function in the generic
   driver structure, right ?
Eventually it could be exactly that, via the generic driver struct.
For now it can be a usb specific thing, and when the generic device
stuff is ready we just go:
#define usb_pool_alloc(...)	dev_pool_alloc(...)
without having to touch any of the driver call sites.
