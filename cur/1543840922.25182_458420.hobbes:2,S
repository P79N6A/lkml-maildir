If you are changing this, then it is better to add the BUG() at destroy time
right now.  This makes it MUCH easier to track down the cause (i.e. when
there are slab items that failed to be released, instead of getting a BUG()
the next time someone tries to load that module and the slab already exists).
Just because a lot of code doesn't check the return value, doesn't mean
it shouldn't be possible to do so.  Consider if there is lots of code
that doesn't check the kmalloc() return value - just because it works
most of the time doesn't mean we should start removing the checks for
a failed kmalloc().
Cheers, Andreas
