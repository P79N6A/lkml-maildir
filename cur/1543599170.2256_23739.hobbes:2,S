do_cpu_ftr_fixups() replaces unsupported code with NOP, based on the
table from __start___ftr_fixup to __stop___ftr_fixup which contains all
the data marked as section(__ftr_fixup).  Fine, but it only handles
section __ftr_fixup data in the kernel, it does not write NOP over
__ftr_fixup data in modules.  So any code marked as section __ftr_fixup
in a module executes unchanged.  Unless I am missing something, that is
a problem.
