I needed to recompress some files from .bz2 to .gz so I setup a script to 
do
bunzip2 -c $file.bz2 |gzip -9 >$file.gz
I expected that the two CPU heavy processes would end up on different 
cpu's and spend a little time shuffling data between the two cpu's on a 
system (dual core opteron)
however, instead what I find is that each process is getting 50% of one 
cpu while the other cpu is 97% idle.
