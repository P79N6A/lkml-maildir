GNU sort uses a merge sort with temporary files on disk. Not sure
how much it keeps in memory during that, but it's probably less
than 150MB. At some point the dirty limit should kick in and write back the 
data of the temporary files; so it's not quite the same as anonymous memory. 
But it's not that different given.
It would be better to measure than to guess. At least Andrew's measurements
on 128MB actually didn't show updatedb being really that big a problem.
Perhaps some people have much more files or simply a less efficient
updatedb implementation?
I guess the people who complain here that loudly really need to supply
some real numbers.
