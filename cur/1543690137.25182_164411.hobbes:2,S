I'm happy to. Assumably you want both a Dmesg of my new working kernel, 
and a dmesg of above described kernel? Note that the dmesg from the 
later kernel be before loading the CMD64X modules, because when I do 
that, I loose my hard drive. Therefore it'll look mostly like my working 
one, except with no ide2 and ide3.
I've gone ahead and posted the current working dmesg here:

I'll have to do the non-working kernel when I get back from work. I'll 
drop a line when I get that posted.
Thanks,
