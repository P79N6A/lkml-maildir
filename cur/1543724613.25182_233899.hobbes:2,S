Yes, that has been done before, and it works - userspace "block drivers"
which permanently mark themselves as PF_MEMALLOC to avoid the obvious
deadlocks.
Note that you can achieve a similar thing in current 2.6 by acquiring
realtime scheduling policy, but that's an artifact of some brainwave which
a VM hacker happened to have and isn't a thing which should be relied upon.
A privileged syscall which allows a task to mark itself as one which
cleans memory would make sense.
