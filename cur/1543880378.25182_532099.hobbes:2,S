I just gave CFS a try on my system. From a user's point of view it looks good 
so far. Thanks for your work.
However I found a problem: When trying to suspend a system patched with 
suspend2 2.2.9.11 it hangs with "doing atomic copy". Pressing the ESC key 
results in a message that it tries to abort suspend, but then still hangs.
I cced suspend2 devel list, perhaps Nigel is interested as well.
