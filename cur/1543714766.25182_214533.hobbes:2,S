Thanks.
A related question.  The comment for MADV_DONTNEED says:
 * NB: This interface discards data rather than pushes it out to swap,
 * as some implementations do.  This has performance implications for
 * applications like large transactional databases which want to discard
 * pages in anonymous maps after committing to backing store the data
 * that was kept in them.  There is no reason to write this data out to
 * the swap area if the application is discarding it.
 *
 * An interface that causes the system to free clean pages and flush
 * dirty pages is already available as msync(MS_INVALIDATE).
MADV_DONTNEED calls zap_page_range().
That propagates dirtiness into the pagecache.
So it *doesn't* "discard data rather than push it out to swap", if the
same dirty data is mapped elsewhere e.g. as a shared anonymous
mapping, does it?
The comment also mentions MS_INVALIDATE, but MS_INVALIDATE doesn't do
what the comment says and doesn't implement anything like POSIX
either.  (Linux's MS_INVALIDATE is practically equivalent to MS_ASYNC).
Is there a call which does what the command about MS_INVALIDATE says,
i.e. free clean pages and flush dirty ones?
Thanks,
