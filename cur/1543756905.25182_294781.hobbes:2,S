Yes, I can do that and thanks for the info.
I'm only reporting it because I think that it may be relevant for others:
Someone may want to fix it before 2.6.11 final comes out. I think it is
easier for the maintainer and most other people on the list to notice
it and fix it than it is for me to get a fix through the proper channels.
Don't worry, I won't report it a third time..
