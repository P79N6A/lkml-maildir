Is there any way this can happen? Host controller drivers register
themselves from module_init(), their probe() function gets called,
which calls mmc_add_host(), which schedules the initial scan. If
multiple host controllers are present, they will all schedule their
scans before all module_init()s have been called. Am I missing
something?

So how is it supposed to work "by design"?

Guess so. It seems like the prepare_namespace stuff is getting less
useful every day.

It's funny that NFS root does not have these kinds of problems then...

Yeah, but I suspect most users will rather have a system that actually
boots than a system that would have booted very quickly if it had booted
at all.
Btw, how can I wait for the scanning to complete from early userspace?
