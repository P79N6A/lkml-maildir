globespan device is a zyxel prestige 630 adsl modem using eciadsl
userspace drivers.
after killing the driver it suspended and resumed.
but i got a problem, trying to restart driver.
[EciAdsl 3/5] Synchronization...
 ERROR reading interrupts
*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x0804f158 ***
/usr/bin/eciadsl-start: line 517: 11399 Abortito               
"$BIN_DIR/eciadsl-synch" $synch_options
ERROR: failed to get synchronization
usb 2-2: usbfs: USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed cmd eciadsl-synch rqt 192 rq 222
len 13 ret -110
tried 3 times, always the same.
so i manually unplugged modem and replugged.
works perfectly (as usual).
seems a problem on suspending and resuming attached device.
i've access to eciadsl cvs so i can patch it.
the first problem (no suspend) i think can be fixed binding some signals
in userspace, which?
the second seems an init problem, that i leave to you :)
