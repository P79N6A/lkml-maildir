Given that esi was 0xc1ffffe8, the oops was triggered by a crossed page
boundary (0xc2000000). This does not look like a hardware problem, but
rather a bug somewhere with too small a malloc for some structure. It
is really hard to tell where. I would suspect some classical bugs such
as kmalloc(sizeof(p)) instead of kmalloc(sizeof(*p)), but it's just
pure guess. I'll try to figure out what the code section was to find
the structure name and check its allocation path.
