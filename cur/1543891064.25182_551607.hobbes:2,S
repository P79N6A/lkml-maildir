Isn't this better be a global process flag? Default should be, for legacy
reasons, !FD_CLOEXEC. But then you can call a sys_task_set_fflags(FD_CLOEXEC)
and all newly created files get that behavior by default. Then, in case 
you want some of them to cross the exec boundary, you explicitly
fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, !FD_CLOEXEC).
Most the MT+exec apps I write, would like FD_CLOEXEC for everything anyway.
