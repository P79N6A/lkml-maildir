Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12-rc1-mm1] net/ethernet/eth.c - eth_header

Hi,
Please consider applying (or droping).
Thank you.
Description: This patch prevent drivers from calling eth_header with a 802.3 
frame using a len>1536. In such a case returns -EINVAL, which was hard to 
choose because the ETH_HLEN is supposed to return.
