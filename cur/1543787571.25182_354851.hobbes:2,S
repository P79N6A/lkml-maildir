This patch set basically allows the "NUMA depends on SMP" dependency to
be removed.  I'm not sure this is the right approach.  There will likely
never be a real-world NUMA system without SMP.  So, this set would seem
to include some increased (#ifdef) complexity for supporting SMP && !
NUMA, which will likely never happen in the real world.
Also, I worry that simply #ifdef'ing things out like CPUsets' update
means that CPUsets lacks some kind of abstraction that it should have
been using in the first place.  An #ifdef just papers over the real
problem.  
I think it would likely be cleaner if the approach was to emulate an SMP
NUMA system where each NUMA node simply doesn't have all of its CPUs
online.
