Hi, this seems like a weird behavior in softdog, yes. I believe you must be 
running version 1.2 of softdog. Could you tell me what version of the kernel 
you are running, and list the content of '/proc/misc' before and after loading 
the softdog kernel module ?
Softdog has been properly tested under 2.0, but not that much under 2.1, so 
that may be the problem. Since softdog tries to check if the kernel supports 
softdog by looking in /proc/misc, and that file's format may have changed 
since 2.0, it may cause the warning above. Your input will probably allow me 
the release softdog 1.3 new and improved :-)
