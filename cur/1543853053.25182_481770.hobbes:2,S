Excellent!
So, either we have a very noisy bit of hardware in there,
or something is wrong with sata_qstor.c.
The device has two methods for dealing with commands.
Regular R/W uses the driver's host queue "packet" interface,
and all other commands pass through the legacy MMIO mechanism.
I'm betting on some bug/interaction with the latter.
Try this patch and see what happens, on top of the printk patch.
Thanks
