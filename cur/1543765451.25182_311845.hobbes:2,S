I get this message occasionally on both my machines.  I googled and saw
some references to this message on 2.4 but nothing for 2.6.  Some of the
references were to APIC, which I don't have enabled.
Both machines are using VIA chipsets and display the "VIA IRQ fixup"
message on boot.  I think this behavior started about the same time that
message started to appear.
On both machines the parallel port is disabled in the BIOS and there's
nothing on IRQ7.
