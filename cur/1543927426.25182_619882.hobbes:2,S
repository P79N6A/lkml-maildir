This limitation shouldn't apply to the percpu area, since gs_base can be 
pointed anywhere in the address space -- in effect we're always indirect.
Obviously the offsets *within* the percpu area has to be in range (±2 GB 
per cpu for absolute offsets, slightly smaller for %rip-based addressing 
-- obviously judicious use of an offset for gs_base is essential in the 
latter case).
Thus you want the percpu areas below -2 GB where they don't interfere 
with modules or any other precious address space.
