Hello !
i've discovered this error during compilation:
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c: In function `ipt_tcpmss_target':
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.c:95: structure has no member named `pmtu'
make[3]: *** [net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_TCPMSS.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [net/ipv4/netfilter] Error 2
make[1]: *** [net/ipv4] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
on demand i'll include .config
now i will switch off this one, and try to compile it without netfilter.
It is still impossilble to make saa7146 module too...
anyway, keep doing this good job folks.
