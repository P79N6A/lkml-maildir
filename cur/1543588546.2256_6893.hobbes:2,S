I finally finished dropping the list_empty() check from my generic rwsemaphores.
The new behaviour of my rwsemaphores are:
-	max sleepers and max simultanous readers both downgraded to 2^(BITS_PER_LONG>>1) for
	higher performance in the fast path
-	up_* cannot be recalled from irq/softirq context anymore
I'm using this your latest patch on top of vanilla 2.4.4-pre6 to benchmark my
new generic rwsemaphores against yours.
To benchmark I'm using your tar.gz but I left my 50 seconds run of the rwtest
with many more readers and writers to stress it a bit more (I posted the
changes to the rwsem-rw.c test in the message where I reported the race in your
semaphores before pre6).
Here the results (I did two tries for every bench and btw the numbers are
quite stable as you can see).

To make it more readable I plotted the numbers in a graph (attached).
So my new C based rw semaphores are faster than your C based semaphores in
all tests and they're even faster than your x86 asm inlined semaphores when
there's contention (however it's probably normal that with contention the asm
semaphores are slower so I'm not sure I can make the asm inlined semaphore
faster than yours).  I will try to boost my new rwsem with asm in the fast path
now (it won't be easy but possibly by only changing a few lines of the slow
path inside an #ifdef CONFIG_...) to see where can I go. Once I will have an
asm inlined fast path for >=486 integrated I will upload a patch but if you
want a patch now with only the new generic C implementation to verify the above
numbers let me know of course (ah and btw the machine is a 2-way PII 450mhz).
I think it's interesting also the comparison of my generic rwsem when inlined
and not inlined (first four columns). BTW, I also tried to move my only lock in
a separated cacheline (growing the size of the rwsem over 32bytes) and that
hurted a lot.
Note also the your wo results with your asm version (the one in pre6 + your
latest try#2) is scoring more than two times worse than my generic semaphores.
