The one-sentence summary is that a triplefault causing machine reset
occurs while hugetlb is used during a long-running regression test for
the Oracle database on both EM64T and x86-64. Thus far attempts to
produce isolated testcases have not been successful. The test involves
duplicating a database across two database instances.
My current work on this consists largely of attempting to get access to
debugging equipment and/or simulators to carry out post-mortem analysis.
I've recently been informed that some of this will be provided to me.
