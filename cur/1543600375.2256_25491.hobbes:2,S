Nice way to destroy read performance.  As DaveM noted so
nicely in his reverse mapping patch (at the end of the
2.3 series), dirty pages get moved to the laundry list
and the washing machine will deal with them when we have
a full load.
Lets face it, spinning the washing machine is expensive
and running less than a full load makes things inefficient ;)
cheers,
Rik
