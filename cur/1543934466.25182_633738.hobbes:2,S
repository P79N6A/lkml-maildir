    When drive initializes, dmesg says it has NCQ (depth 0/32)
    Reading the queue_depth under /sys, shows a queuedepth of "1".
But more importantly -- I notice a chronic error message associate
with this drive that may be causing some or all of the problem:

What da heck?  Note, this is with NCQ-queuing set to "1".  Only 
reference I could find for this error referred to "older drives", but 
this is a
2007-model year drive with ATA-7 and udma-6.
