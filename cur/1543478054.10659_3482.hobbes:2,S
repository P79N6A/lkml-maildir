If one has the card and a signal generator covering the appropriate
range, one should be able to sweep across the range and find both end
frequencies with reliable accuracy...

More likely, the data sheets are 'politically correct' - many
countries prohibit reception of radio signals outside of 88-108 by
those not licensed to do so, and the data sheets are usually written
with one eye open for possible sales problems...

Probably a better choice would be for the kernel to assume that it
can, and report an error if the hardware says otherwise, at least as
far as that is possible...
Best wishes from Riley.
