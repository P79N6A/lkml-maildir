Ugh.  OK.  How's this?  (2 patches)
(oh, OP mentioned CONFIG_PHYLIB but it's actually CONFIG_MII AFAIK)

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
pegasus and mcs7830 drivers use MII interfaces and should
select MII in the same way that drivers/net/ drivers do.
However, the MII config symbol should not be in the 10/100 Ethernet
menu, so that other drivers can use (enable) it or so that users
can enable it without needing to enable 10/100 Ethernet.
