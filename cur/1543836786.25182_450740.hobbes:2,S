I can't say I like the name. After all that should be the normal
case for a long time now ... native? normal? bareiron?
Also I would prefer if you split this file up a bit - the old
processor/system/irqflags split wasn't too bad.

This function can be completely written in C using local_save_flags()/local_restore_flags()
Please do that. I guess it's still a good idea to keep it separated
though because it might allow other optimizations.
e.g. i've been thinking about special casing IF changes in save/restore flags 
to optimize CPUs which have slow pushf/popf. If you already make sure
all non IF manipulations of flags are separated that would help.

Actually I don't think this one should be para virtualized at all.
I don't see any reason at all why a hypervisor should trap it and it
is very time critical. I would recommend you move it back into the 
normal files without hooks.

The comment seems out of date (no set TS)

Maybe it's just me, but can't you just drop all these __s around
asm and volatile? They are completely useless as far I know. 
Also the assembly will be easier readable if you just keep it on a single 
line for the simple ones.
