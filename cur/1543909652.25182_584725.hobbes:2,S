Interesting, we never used -l that way. We used -l to get data for all
exiting tasks
./getdelays -d -l
For the usage you've mentioned, I'd use
while :
do
	sleep 2
	./getdelays -p 1 -d
done
I guess your changes change getdelays and since there are other ways
to obtaining the same data, I'd remove the last bit of changes made
to send the TGID often to get data.
