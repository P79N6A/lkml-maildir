I wasn't aware that any of these existed, he didn't mention them in this
patch series. Having now looked, all I've managed to find are a series
of simple example apps that no longer work because of API changes.
Also, if you've been paying attention, you'll note that I've never
criticized the performance or quality of the underlying kevent
implementation -- as best I can tell, aside from some lockdep complaints
(which, afaik, are the result of lockdep's limitations rather than
problems with kevent), the internals of kevent are excellent.
