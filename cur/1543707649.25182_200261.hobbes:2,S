I agree, that would be the best.
So if you take out the line about starting udevd, does it work for you?
How about changing the #!/bin/bash to #!/bin/sash in the first line for
the start_udev script?
What distro is this?
Can you run strace on the start_udev script after boot to see who is
needing access to /dev/null?
Oh, and if you create the /dev/null node as the first thing in the
start_udev script does that work?
thanks,
