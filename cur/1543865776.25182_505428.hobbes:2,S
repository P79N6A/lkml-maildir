Subject: ohci1394 broke 2.6.19 -> 2.6.20-rc1

Prior to testing a patch for bugzilla bug 7569 (hosts lost on bus
reset), I wanted to reproduce the behavior.  I can under the noted
2.6.16-blah kernels, but moving to anything more recent than 2.6.19
means ohci1394 is non-functional (no 1394 hosts are detected) and the
module cannot be removed.
I have narrowed it down to 2.6.19 works, 2.6.20-rc1 doesn't.  Lots of detail at:
