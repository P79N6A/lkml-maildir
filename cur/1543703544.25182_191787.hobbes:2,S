It saves all registers before switch_to. It does that two times at present. 
Once (implicit) register save by gcc and an explicit register save in 
arch/<proc>/kernel/entry.S Second register save in kern_schedule generates a 
pt_regs structure which gdb can get all registers at once from. If it's 
omited, gdb has to figure out where gcc has saved registers from the 
non-standards code in switch_to, which it can't do correctly all the time.
We can have a check for (a new variable) debugger_enabled before calling 
kern_schedule. That'll be add negligible overhead and will allow extra thread 
info to be saved only when a debugger is enabled. There will not be any need 
for CONFIG_KGDB_THREAD also.
