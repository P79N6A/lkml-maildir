Well, that's a can of worms we DON'T want to open.  What's to stop Microsoft
from claiming their own interpretaion of the GPL?  The whole point behind the
GPL (and any license) is that it cannot be vaguely interpreted by various
individuals and companies.

Well, what if one company create a Linux application and used the "Linus GPL"
instead of the "FSF GPL" to defend its practices?  I think there's some
situation going on right now about an company that released a non-GPL Linux
media player (or something like that) that links in someone else's GPL code.
Besides, isn't the "Linus GPL" somewhere between the "FSF GPL" and the LGPL?
