I'm thinking of upgrading the innards of my home machine, and
currently I'm interested in using a motherboard based around the
Granite Bay chipset (specifically, I looking at an Asus P4G8X).
I notice that 2.5 kernels now have explicit support for this
chipset, while 2.4 don't seem to.  So, if I ran a 2.4 kernel
on such a machine, would it a) not work, b) work fine, or
c) work OK but not as well as it could do?
Widening the point somewhat, I notice messages on the list
go by stating that motherboard such-and-such is stable/flaky under
linux.  Is there any list anywhere of known good/bad boards,
chipsets, etc?
