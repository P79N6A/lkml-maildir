Hi
i also had problems with the card in some 2.4.x releases
but it seems to work for me on a 2.4.20 kernel.
3c59x: Donald Becker and others. www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
00:0a.0: 3Com PCI 3c905C Tornado at 0xec00. Vers LK1.1.16
i do still have problems with a card in another machine when rebooting
from windows into linux it fails to init properly.
But since the machine boots from nfs i have not been bothered to
dump the info from this.
