Are you sure that standard ftp will be able to handle extended 
attributes without modification?
One approach is to create a plugin called ..archive that when read is a 
virtual file consisting of an archive of everything in the directory. 
 It would be interesting I think to attach said plugin to standard 
directories by default along with several other standard plugins like 
..cat, etc.

You access /foo/bar, /foo/bar/,,bar, /foo/..bar by name.

Naming conventions are easy, but teaching user space is hard no matter 
whose scheme is used.
