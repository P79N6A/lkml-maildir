   So why don't you share the results?  Perhaps then I can see the light,
   too.  With the exception of task coloring, the thread_info is strictly
   more work and it's possible to do task coloring without thread_info.
All performance tests I ran were "about the same" on sparc64, on x86
we really only have one anomaly on one of Linus's SMP x86 machines
(fork+exec from lmbench on dual-Athlon) and I'm going to push to
investigate that further.
