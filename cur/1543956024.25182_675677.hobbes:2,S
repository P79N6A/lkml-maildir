Wait, this should be opposite, right?

And the refcnt check really isn't needed, right?  Either undo_list
exists and both parent and child have it, or it doesn't and we're fine.
So I suspect I can remove that.
Manfred, I'm trying to test this, but can't get an error without this
patch.  Do you have a testcase?  (I've tried some combinations of
creating a semarray in the new ipcns, creating one with fewer elements
than the index on which the undo operation was done, and not creating
a semarray in the new ipcsns at all, but the current code seems to
do fine.
Or maybe I fundamentally misunderstand the bug.
