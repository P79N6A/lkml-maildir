It would help if you could come up with a simple test case
which exhibits this problem - some sequence of steps which
is reproducible by others, and which has repeatable effects.
Is your I/O system performing properly?  Try running
	hdparm -t /dev/hdaX
where /dev/hdaX refers to your root filesystem.  You
should get 15-30 megabytes per second.
You also report that your PPC-based laptop has processes
unexpectedly terminating when the machine is under VM
pressure.  You should check your kernel logs (usually
/var/log/messages) to see if the process was killed
due to an out-of-memory condition.  If it's not that,
and if it's not due to application bugs then the ppc
kernel may be dropping modified- or dirty-bits in its
PTEs, which is rather unlikely.
