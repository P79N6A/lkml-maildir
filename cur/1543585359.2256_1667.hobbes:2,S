matroxset-0.3 is latest one. You are probably doing something wrong:
(1) With fbset you are trying to use 8bpp or 24bpp color depth.
Secondary
    head supports only 16/32bpp.
(2) You did not insmod all needed modules if you compiled matroxfb as
    modular (you should compile everything into the kernel...)
(3) You are trying to do some illegal thing, like connecting both
    /dev/fb0 and /dev/fb1 into same output...
