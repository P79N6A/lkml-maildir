AFAIKS, we set prev_priority to the priority at which the zone was
deemed to require no more reclaiming, not DEF_PRIORITY.

If that happens, shouldn't prev_priority be set to 0?
I don't agree the patch is correct.

We saw problems with this before releasing SLES10 too. See
zone_is_near_oom and other changesets from around that era. I would
like to know what workload was prevented from going OOM with these
changes, but zone_is_near_oom didn't help -- it must have been very
marginal (or there may indeed be a bug somewhere).
