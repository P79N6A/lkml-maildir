Sorry, my benchmark program actually had a bug (first loop included
page faults). Here are updated numbers. They are somewhat different:
Athlon 64:
readpte hot 25
readpte cold 171
readpte_cmp hot 18
readpte_cmp cold 162
Nocona:
readpte hot 118
readpte cold 443
readpte_cmp hot 22
readpte_cmp cold 224
The difference is much smaller here.  Assuming cache cold cmpxchg8b is
better, at least on the Intel CPUs which have a slow rmb().
