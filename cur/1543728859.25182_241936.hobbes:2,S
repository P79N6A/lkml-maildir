Hi,
I just compiled 2.6.8.1 for my system, and found the following in dmesg:
-----
Intel ISA PCIC probe: not found.
Device 'i823650' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.
Badness in device_release at drivers/base/core.c:85

... which reminded me that I still had this in my .config (the card
isn't in there anymore since quite a while now, so the failure to find
it is expected).
Apologies if this has already been reported, but googling didn't reveal
anything.
