In answer to my own question, reading the 2.5 source was illuminating. 
The intent of the test is obvious:
akpm     1.50         | 	/*
akpm     1.50         | 	 * Check to see if `name' resides inside a module which has been
akpm     1.50         | 	 * unloaded (someone forgot to destroy their cache)
akpm     1.50         | 	 */
