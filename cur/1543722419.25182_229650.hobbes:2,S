Hello,
how is now the status of the preemptible feature of the kernel 2.6.7. 
Should preempt be used for desktop systems (like in the help menu) or 
should it not really?
I have made tests with the alsa-latency-test, where it not really 
reduces the latency of the kernel and gives a little bit lower 
performance of the whole system.
Regards,
Pl.cc me.
Marcus
