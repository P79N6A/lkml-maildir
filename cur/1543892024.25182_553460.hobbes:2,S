Darrick, I see a kernel bug in this area(which is already filled with bugs,
and I am looking into ways to fix them). Are you making sure that
between step-1 and step-2, that interrupts actually started arriving at cpu1?
i.e., do step-1 and wait till the irq's start hitting at cpu1. At this point
do step-2 and let us know if you still hit this bug?

Is this a theory or did you observe this problem happening?
