I don't think I'm arguing whether or not your solution may work, what I
am arguing is really a more philosophical point.  Not "can we do it
this way", but "should we do it way".  I am of the opinion that
management belongs in userspace.  I also am of the opinion that if you
can successfully accomplish something in user space, you should.  I
also believe that even if you provide this basic interface, all system
vendors are going to provide libraries on top of that to customize it,
so you've not added much value to just a simple message passing
interface.
So, I'm happy to defer to Jeff's judgement call here - I just want to
do what's right for our customers and get an enclosure management
interface for SATA exposed, preferrably in time for the 2.6.26 merge
window.  If he prefers your design, I'll disagree, but commit to his
decision and try to get this to work for SATA. If he'd rather see
something along the lines of what I proposed, then since it is 100% self
contained in the SATA subsystem, it shouldn't impact whatever you
want to do in the SCSI subsystem.
Jeff?
