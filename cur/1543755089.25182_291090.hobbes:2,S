Probably a task event is rescheduling itself repeatedly? e100 does not seem 
to schedule_task() events directly, so I wonder what is going on.
Can you boot a machine with profile=2, then send the WOL packet causing
keventd to go mad and run:
readprofile | sort -nr +2 | head -20
After a few minutes.
Ganesh, Scott, Jeff, any ideas?
