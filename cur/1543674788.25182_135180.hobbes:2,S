Are you still running all of your tests with X up?  You then have no chance
of getting any useful diagnostics without a serial console.  Can't you switch
back to a vty while the test is running?

You will need a null modem cable.  Config a kernel with serial console
support enabled.  Use a fairly high speed for your console (115200).  To
enable your first serial port as a console add something like the following
to your kenrel command line:
console=ttyS0,115200 console=vty0
This will retain console output on the vty too.
