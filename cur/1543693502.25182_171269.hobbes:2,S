Right, the add_to_swap_cache in try_to_swap_out.

Right, the mark_page_accessed in try_to_swap_out
(I don't see any other mark_page_accessed as problematic).
Or the del_page_from_active_list in refill_inactive.

(Mainline is easier than -rmap since no separate PG_inactive bit.)
Thanks a lot for explaining, I see it now.  Personally I'd prefer a
lighter weight patch, either pagemap_lru_lock within add_to_swap_cache,
or better moving the PG_flags clearing from __add_to_page_cache into
__free_pages_ok, where I still believe it can be done non-atomically.
But you've proved your point, and I understand you preferring a more
straightforward and future-proof way.  I'm not writing an alternative
patch, don't let me stand in the way of progress...
A little of the above explanation in the change comment would be nice.
Thanks,
Hugh
