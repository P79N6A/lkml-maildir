Hello all.
I'm having problems booting 2.4.17 on a Mandrake 8.1 system (with all
current updates).
When I boot 2.4.17 (with an initrd image) I get the following...
kernel boots ...
Creating root device
mkrootdev: mknod failed: 17
Mounting root filesyste with flags data=ordered
Mount: error 16 mounting ext3 flags data=ordered
...Tried to remount without flags and fails with the same error...
Kernel Panic: No initrd found ...
I am using ext3 / /boot /usr /var & /home filesystems
2.4.8-34.1mdk boots fine however.
I'm about to go try 2.4.16 (it was working with reiserfs partitions
before).
The machine is an AMD Athalon 1.3 Ghz on an EPOC board with a 3ware 7800
series RAID card, with three 75/80 GB drives in a RAID 5 array.
Anyone else run into something like this? 
I'll report back about 2.4.16 and if anyone would like more info, just
shout.
