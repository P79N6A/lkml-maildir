Hi All,
I am making a concerted effort (probably in vain :-)
to keep the uClinux (MMU-less support) up to date with
the 2.5 series kernels.
I am keeping patches at:
   
http://www.uclinux.org
:/pub/uClinux/uClinux-2.5.x/
The most current is linux-2.5.25uc0.patch. It seems
to work pretty well (at least on the target boards I
try it on).
I am mainly working on the ColdFire CPU architecture
support, since that is the hardware I have at hand.
Regards
Greg
