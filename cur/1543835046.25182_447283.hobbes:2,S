sounds like some varient of conditional variables, caveat might be that
new readers permitted if in the same call thread/cpu? 
(i.e recurive inside the same context?)
for e.g with the cpufreq kind of usage today, 
cpu_down()
   waits for ref to drop to zero;
   // now signalled by last reader when refcnt drops to 0
   do pre-remove-notify---> cpufreq 
	// this attempt to acquire read lock again shoudnt be blocked right
        // even though we have officially started waiting for cnt to drop 0?
problem was with the kondemand() when a remove_wq() caused a flush_wq()
that started to yeild and run the other wq thread. Now the depth control
that checked if the locking_task == current wasnt true that caused the 
dead lock again.

so this is sort of like the get_cpu()/put_cpu() interface that does 
preempt_disable() + get current cpu.
