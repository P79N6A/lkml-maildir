Over the last month, I have been having trouble with raid0.
I am running a dual Xeon with four 32GB Barracudas on a
Adaptec 2940U2W.  This is 2.2.11 with the development patches 
from kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/raid/alpha.
raid0_map bug: hash->zone0==NULL for block 1132810879
Bad md_map in ll_rw_block
raid0_map bug: hash->zone0==NULL for block 1132810879
Bad md_map in ll_rw_block
Disk data is corrupted as verified by hex dumps using
dd and od; examining the dump, it appears as if blocks 
are overwritten.
It may be relevant that the raid0 was made with a chuck 
size of 128 and mke2fs with no -b.  I realize that not
using a larger block may lead to inefficiencies; if someone
can confirm that this is the source of my problems, that
would be helpful too.
Otherwise, I don't understand the raid0.c code enough to 
know what to do (e.g. besides dumping software raid0 in favor 
or hardware raid)  Any suggestions?
