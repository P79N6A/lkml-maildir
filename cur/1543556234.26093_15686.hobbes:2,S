Ivan,
	We dug a little deeper, and think that we found the problem. 
The error occurs if we have over 1024 MB of memory in the machine. 
If we have less than 1024MB, the machine behaves correctly. 
(This is a 600Mhz Digital Personal Workstation)
Once again, the 2.2 kernel in RH 7.0 behaves properly. 
I'll give test12-pre3 a try and see if it fixes things.
Thanks,
--Phil
