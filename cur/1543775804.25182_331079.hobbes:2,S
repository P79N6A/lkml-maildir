FWIW, we should encourage the janitors to submit patches larger than 
simply one patch per file.  Spreading the -same- logical change across 
multiple patches is really taking the "split it up" mantra too far.
We want logical changes separated...  but this just spams the log IMO.
All of the __devinit changes could have been rolled into a single patch, 
since its going to a single maintainer (Bart).
