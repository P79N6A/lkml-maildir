Fortunately, on the userspace ABI, it should just be the cardmgr
ioctls that are affected. In this case there are no current 64-bit PPC
platforms with PCMCIA, so there are no existing users to regress. New
users (with 32-bit userspace) shouldn't be using the cardmgr tools.
So yes, someone who takes an old 32-bit userspace with cardmgr, moves
it to a new 64-bit platform and expects the old 32-bit tools to work
will find that they don't. Not that they would have otherwise either.

Last time I posted this I got the answer from Christoph that it's cardmgr
and the ioctl interface it uses, and there's still users out there that
have been neglecting the error messages, etc.
Unfortunately, ioaddr_t is used both in the ioctl interface as well as
to pass around some of the same structures within the kernel. So I could
either do major overhaul of the PCMCIA stack, or change this type for
ppc64. I went for the latter given that MIPS and ARM obviously already
got away with doing it.
