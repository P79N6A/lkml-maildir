I'm a little disappointed that after I spent time converting them into
the wiki form, you're now proposing abandoning them again.  This seems
like a retrograde step.
What I'd be more interested in doing is combining the must- and should-
fix lists.  As a first pass, just put all the must-fix items on the
should-fix list at pri 4.  One of the things I did was delete the things
that appeared on both lists.  This would obviously be easier if they
were in one list ;-)
