All that is required is a proper device node in /dev; is this really
so much of a burden?   This device node can be created statically
at install time or via udev or any other method.   In fact if you're 
using udev and a device node isn't automatically created for all 
of your cd burners, you can file a bug report and get it fixed.   So in 
the end all you ever have to teach a user is to pick the device they
want from /dev.
