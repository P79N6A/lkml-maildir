Ingo,
Maybe this wasn't the right way to fix the problem? I just looked at the 
S4 patch and it had the same change in it, but did not exhibit the same 
problem. Not knowing exactly what I was looking for, I just started 
looking for obvious changes that might affect dropping tcp connections 
and this one seemed reasonable. I made the change and the problem went 
away. Maybe this needs looking at a little closer.
