It is currently impossible to unload a framebuffer modules AFAIK.
For the other things you mention, you should contact the matroxfb
maintainer, Petr Vandrovec, listed at the top of matroxfb.c.  Petr has
some matroxfb updates that are not yet in the kernel, perhaps using his
test version would solve your problem.
Another key framebuffer resource is the fbdev list: 
linux-fbdev@vuser.vu.union.edu 
Send to majordomo@vuser.vu.union.edu to subscribe.
Also read linux/REPORTING-BUGS for an idea of what information you
should provide about your system, to help us debug the problem.
