Subject: [PATCH 0/7] driver core: export MAJOR/MINOR to the hotplug env
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/22/170

This patch sequence moves the creation of the sysfs "dev" file of the class
devices into the driver core. The struct class_device contains a dev_t
value now. If set, the driver core will create the "dev" file containing
the major/minor numbers automatically.
The MAJOR/MINOR values are also exported to the hotplug environment. This
makes it easy for userspace, especially udev to know if it should wait for
a "dev" file to create a device node or if it can just ignore the event.
We currently carry a compiled in blacklist around for that reason.
It would also be possible to run some "tiny udev" while sysfs is not
available - just by reading the hotplug call or the netlink-uevent.
Thanks,
Kay
