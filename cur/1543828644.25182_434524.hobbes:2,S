I couldn't find any evidence of this effort. Whatever, past is past, if
someone fixes the i2c-ite and i2c-algo-ite drivers soon, fine with me,
if not, the drivers will be deleted (which doesn't mean they can't be
resurrected later if there is interest and someone takes over
maintenance.) I'm setting the deadline to September 2006.
