Uhm, someone told me that they shouldn't be used because the kernel
has generic functions for that.
I researched the kernel sources, and looking at bitops.h I found
setbit(), so I tried to use it in the driver, althought I prefer
standard |= and &=.
Are there more generic bitops kernel functions I may didn't find and I
should use in the future?
Anyway, it's just a question: I will turn back the driver to use |=
and &=, they look better to me too.
