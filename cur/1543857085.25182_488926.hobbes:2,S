That's still just "what" and doesn't explain why
this change is desirable.
Software x86 decoders clearly must handle any valid
prefix order, so they shouldn't care. (I've written one
recently. It's tedious but not rocket science.)
If hardware x86 decoders (i.e., Intel or AMD processors)
get measurably faster with the new order, that would be
a good reason to change it.
