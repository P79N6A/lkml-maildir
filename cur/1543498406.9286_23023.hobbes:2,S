yes this is very unscientific because now we have 3 processes running at
once: X, xosview and the computing thread. X and xosview have higher
priorities (because they are 'interactive' processes), so they might end
up pushing around the CPU-consuming thread. 
do you still see the same 'bouncing' effect if you start the thread with
'nice -n -100 ./thread' ?
