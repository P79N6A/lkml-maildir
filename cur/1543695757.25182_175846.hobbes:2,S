If EFI trim is doing its job (and the current version now seems
to be handling all cases correctly), then you should no longer
be able to have a TLB entry erroneously marking an uncacheable
area of memory for cacheable access ... so you can keep the prefetch
for ia64 (David pointed out that dropping this prefetch has a
severe negative impact on lmbench fork+execve test).
