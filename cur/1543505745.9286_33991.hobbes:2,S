Subject: crash w/2.2.12-pre1, probably ide-scsi related

Compiled 2.2.12-pre1 for testing. gcc 2.7.2.3, x86 (AMD K6/200).
I postponed my cd-writing until I could test it with the new kernel.
The cd-rw is a HP 8100+ used via ide-scsi. It's the only ide-scsi device
and is connected to hdc in ide notation.
The writing went fine. I did a 'eject' manually when the writing was
complete, the tray came out. While the tray was out, I typed
mount /mnt/cdrom
This accesses the cdrom via ide-scsi but using it as scsi cd, not scsi
generic device. The scsi cdrom and universal cdrom module loaded fine.
It recognized the cd and the logs showed that it was using rock ridge
extensions.
Before the mount command completed, I switched to another xterm and
continued to write an e-mail. Suddenly the keyboard locked up and the
mouse didn't move. I pressed keys and moved and clicked the mouse -
nothing happened. Tries to switch consoles - still nothing. When I thought
it had just crashed, a text console came to view and it worked.
I switched to CV 12 where my logs ran - only root logoff was added there.
Switched to tty7 where X had ran - no X, only the message
INIT: PANIC: Segmentation violation, giving up.
X was dead, klog was dead, init was dead. most daemons were dead.
I could log in on the text console but most daemons were dead so I deciced
to just boot. SysRQ+{S,U,B} was the only way to boot.
This reminds me some ide-scsi problems in the past.
I used to give -eject to cdrecord, otherwise the loading of scsi cd module
had strange results (wrong disk info etc). And a hang once. This might be
the same problem. Today I didn't use -eject and it misbehaved again.
