I found out some of my disks have no partition table 'readable by Linux'.  Which is really f***** weird since, they can be read under NT.  What is also really weird is that some of these disks can be mounted as /dev/hdd4 even though there is no valid partition.
In some cases these are zip disks that were readable under 2.2.x, but since I don't have 2.2.x anymore I cannot verify that they would still be readable.  Rather strange that a disk partition would just disapear like that.  Unless the drive itself is hiding it or not recgonizing it.
In any case it seems if I run fdisk against the disks and then mformat they behave better.  But aren't zip disks formated and partitioned out of the box?  These ones all were.

Mine is not an 'iomega' drive, but a copy.  Made by someone else. AFAIK.

I got mine cause it was cheap, internal and I already had zip disks.

This would explain what I am seeing, weird as it may seem.  I used to be using an external iomega zip drive that recgonized these disks, but now the internal one does not seem to.
I guess this means that I have to run fdisk on all these disks. Then mformat.
Hmm, it would be nice if there was a workaround.
