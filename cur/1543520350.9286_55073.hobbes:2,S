Subject: [PATCH] fix i386 panic hangs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
The panic() path ends up doing 2 consecutive smp_send_stop(), one in
panic() itself, the other in i386 machine_restart(). The second one
hangs if there are >1 cpus, presumably because the other cpus are
not in a state to respond/act on the new stop request. 
This patch fixes the problem, by allowing only the first smp_send_stop()
to do any real work.
Please include in 2.3.35. Thanks.
Kanoj
