Ok, this is what happens:
iptable_filter sets up initial_table.
The part that says { IPT_ALIGN(sizeof(struct ipt_standard_target)), "" }
  initializes a xt_entry_target struct. target_size gets the value 
  0x24 and name "". 
This is copied to loc_cpu_entry in iptables.c:ipt_register_table() 
  and translate_table is called
translate_table calls IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE with the 
  check_entry_function
check_entry does t->u.kernel.target = target;
On this particular architecture u.user.name and u.kernel.target in 
struct xt_entry_target has the same address (because of the union). So 
name that was previously "" gets mangled here.
check_entry returns into translate_table which calls mark_source_chains
mark_source_chains compares t->target.u.user.name with 
IPT_STANDARD_TARGET. name has been mangled above and the comparision 
fails. On my ARM platform name has not been mangled (I guess this is 
because target and name doesn't share address by I haven't checked).
So... Is it really correct to modify the target pointer there?

2.6.19. After further testing it seams to be a compiler/CPU issue. The exact
same kernelconfig works on ARM. So I have to dig some...
