Embedding base in function name (func10, func8, func16 [, func2])
will eliminate that possibility and also save one argument
push on stack.
You can always multiplex them locally:
static int func_generic(base...) {...}
int func10(...) { return func_generic(10, ....); }
int func8(...) { return func_generic(8, ....); }
You also can have a faster "static int func_power_of_2(base...)" for
2,8,16, etc.
