Juan,
I had been using 2.2.14pre16 to forward Win PPTP from my winblows
machine to our Corp Business network.
I upgraded to 2.2.18pre9 and used make oldconfig using my .config file
from my 2.2.14 directory.
I can no longer log into our Corp network using my Linux system as
ip-forwarder for my winblows machine using VPN.
I rebooted 2.2.14 and things worked fine.
Am I missing something? Is there anything special I need to do for
2.2.18?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Steve
