Hello kernel developers:
I just want to congratulate you on an excellent (as usual) release of the
2.6 series Linux kernel.  I recently upgraded from 2.4.23 to 2.6.1 and am
totally blown away by the improvements and upgrades.
Thank you so much for continuing to provide an excellent product.
Regards,
