Ok, I'll leave them alone, then.
Just another quick question: is kallsyms_names only used by the 
functions in kallsyms.c and everyone else simply uses those functions, 
or are there direct users of kallsyms_names?
This is because another thing I was pondering was to change the stem 
compression scheme into a different one, changing all the stuff in 
kallsyms.c accordingly. If there are direct users of kallsyms_names, 
this would break them. There are none in the vanilla kernel as far as I 
can grep, but there might be outside (like in kdb).
I've done some tests with a different scheme and my uncompressed 170kb 
symbol table goes to about 134kb with stem compression and to about 90kb 
with the new scheme. This is not usable right now because compression 
still takes a long time (although the decompression inside 
kernel/kallsyms.c is even simpler than it is now). I'm now trying to 
speed up compression.
As always, comments will be greatly appreciated :)
