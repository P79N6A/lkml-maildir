Hi,
I guess I'm just a bit stupid, but I need some help to find out why :-)
I took Andreas patch and tried to add the commands that growisofs and
cdrecord need here on my system so that users could write cds again.
The resulting scsi_ioctl.c now looks like this:
...
                /* read-mode */
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_GET_CONFIGURATION),
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_GET_EVENT_STATUS_NOTIFICATION),
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_GET_PERFORMANCE),
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_MECHANISM_STATUS),
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_PREVENT_ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL),
                safe_for_read(REZERO_UNIT),
                safe_for_read(0xe9),
                safe_for_read(0xed),
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_MODE_SELECT_10),
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_READ_FORMAT_CAPACITIES),
                /* should this allowed for read ? */
where the last 6 safe_for_read commands were added. To make sure that
I really used this new scsi_ioctl.c I also changed the debugging output to
printk(KERN_WARNING "THIS IS MY NEW PATCH SCSI-CMD Filter...)
and compiled a new kernel from these sources. Booting it, I still cannot
use cdrecord or growisofs, although the new kernel is running. Trying
growisofs tells me again:
Aug 18 13:52:21 aiken kernel: THIS IS MY NEW PATCH SCSI-CMD Filter: 0x23 not allowed with read-mode
although 0x23 should be GPCMD_READ_FORMAT_CAPACITIES according to cdrom.h,
and that command is definitely allowed by (see above)
                safe_for_read(GPCMD_READ_FORMAT_CAPACITIES),
So it seems that the new commands that I added are just ignored and have
no effect when running growisofs as user.
How can that be? Am I missing sth? Is the order in which the commands
are added via safe_for_read important?
Any hints appreciated :-)
cu,
Frank
