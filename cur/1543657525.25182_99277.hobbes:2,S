It's obvious that you are not going to listen to anyone who disagrees with
you so would you please stop filling our mailboxes?
This is not a new discussion. In past discussions it has been decided that
just including header files is not enough to make something a derived
work. you don't agree with that so you are going to go make a pest of
yourself. spare us the further e-mail.
Linus made a statement in the last couple of months about binary-only
modules for the kernel. please go read that before you go further.
