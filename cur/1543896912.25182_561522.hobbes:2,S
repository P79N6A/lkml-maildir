Technical reply about my disagreement.
It's a problem more like "it's broken, but somebody use this in the
source tree". Good example is if "someone uses page_mapping on a slab
page" and have oops with SLUB:
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0706221531520.19704@schroedinger.engr.sgi.com>

Thus, if one doesn't know what `#!/bin/sh' really is, don't
"syntax error" with possible another sh[ell]. In the Linux build system
$(CONFIG_SHELL) currently is bash, but that's only in the kbuild *now*.
Hope that clarifies.
