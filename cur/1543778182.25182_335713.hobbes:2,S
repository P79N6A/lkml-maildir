Subject: Device supported by the OSS trident driver not supported by ALSA

I'm currently creating a list of OSS drivers where all the hardware 
supported by them is also supported by ALSA. The goal is to schedule 
them for removal (except someone tells that for one or more of them ALSA 
support is inferior).
The OSS trident driver has 5 different pci_device_id entries.
For 4 of them there seems to be similar ALSA support, but I can't find 
any ALSA equivalent for the following entry:
        {PCI_VENDOR_ID_INTERG, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTERG_5050,
         PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, CYBER5050},
Can anyone tell my why this device is supported by the OSS trident 
driver but not by ALSA?
TIA
Adrian
