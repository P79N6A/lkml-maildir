Does the kernel print a message like "Advanced speculative caching feature present" 
or not present at boot up? 
If yes does it go away when you boot with unsafe-gart-alias  ? 
What other command line options do you use? Perhaps mem=nopentium? If yes
does it help when you boot without that and with unsafe-gart-alias specified.
