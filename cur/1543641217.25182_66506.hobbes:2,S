I tried the 2.4.19-ck3-aa patch last night, and did a few informal tests
against my current production kernel, 2.4.19-ac4. Machine in Athlon
1400MHz, 1GB RAM, 20+30GB WD disks.
Kernel compile was about 7 sec faster with ck3-aa, 6:58 vs 7:05 (no -j
values).
Then I did my nightly backup of a scanned documentation project, making a
CD image from the scans, currently ~570MB. I was on ck3-aa, and I said
"self, that seemed pretty fast!" So I rebooted cold and tried the mkisofs
with both kernels, twice each.
			2.4.19-ac4		2.4.19-ck3-aa
mkisofs 570MB		2:05			1:14
It was repeatably 40% faster! More testing, and now I'll build a stock
2.4.19 kernel for additional testing, and pull that responsiveness
benchmark and try that, too.
Looks like a nice job overall, I'm putting it on a laptop tonight, which
may give a better idea of how fast, or not, it really is.
