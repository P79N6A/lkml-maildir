Here we are assuming that the pre-allocated critical page pool is big enough
to satisfy the requirements of all the critical sockets.
In the current critical page pool implementation, there is also a limitation 
that only order-0 allocations(single page) are supported. I think in the
networking send/receive patch, the only place where multi-page allocs are
requested is in the drivers if the MTU > PAGESIZE. But i guess the drivers
are getting updated to avoid > order-0 allocations.
Also during the emergency, we free the memory allocated for non-critical 
packets as quickly as possible so that it can be re-used for critical
allocations.
Thanks
