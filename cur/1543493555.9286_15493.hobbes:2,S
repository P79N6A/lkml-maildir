last night an oops killed my 2.2.6 system (486) when trying to run `md5sum' 
on all files on a ATAIP CDROM (/dev/hdd).  
after reboot, the same operation did not crash the PC again, so I can't repeat:(
since the system was completely dead I only noted the EIP of the two oops:
1st:
	invalid operation: 0000
	EIP c011ac95 (sys_munmap + 5)
	process running:  md5sum
2nd:
	kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000002b
	EIP c011ad7b (exit_mmap + 0x0b)
relevant part of Systemmap:
	c011aa30 T do_munmap
==>	c011ac90 T sys_munmap
	c011acd0 T build_mmap_avl
==>	c011ad70 T exit_mmap
	c011ae80 T insert_vm_struct
sorry that I can't give more information,
Harald
