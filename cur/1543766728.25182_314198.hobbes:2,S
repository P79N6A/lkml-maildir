Yes, ext3 really does suck in many ways.
One of my (least) favourite suckage is a process that does "fsync" on a
single file (mail readers etc), which apparently causes ext3 to sync all
dirty data, because it can only sync the whole log. So if you have stuff
that writes out things that aren't critical, it negatively affects
something totally independent that _does_ care.
I remember some early stuff showing that reiserfs was _much_ better for 
BK. I'd be willing to bet that's probably true for git too.
