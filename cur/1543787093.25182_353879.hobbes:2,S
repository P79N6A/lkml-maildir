That's true.  And, changing topic to userspace apps, killall(1)
currently has no race-free way to check whether the user still matches.
There's also the reliability aspect: killing one's own process, but
other than the intended one, is a reliability issue.
What I have proposed is a way to deal with both of these.
killall is just an example.  A GUI point-and-click task manager would
have the same problem and the same solution would work for it.
