May-be not if you aren't using it when the problem occured.

A separate card, not necessarily old. Btw, using old controller with
recent chipsets does not appear like a good idea to me, especially with
PCI, even if specs says that this should work. The same remark applies to
SCSI.

IIRC, the board uses a LVD to SE converter that allows to use SE device
and LVD device driven by a single SCSI initiator. I never tried such a 
controller, but on controller that does not use LVD to SE converter you 
must use *at most* 2 cables and terminate the BUS at each end and only at 
each end. "End" mean the *extreme* end of the cable.
If you dismount the Jaz and the Jaz was not at one end of the BUS, you
have been fine, otherwise you just broke your BUS compliance.

UDC means unexpected diconnection. That means that the device disconnected
from the BUS when the initiator didn't expect it to do so.
Disconnections not allowed means that the initiator does not grant the
device the privilege to disconnect the BUS with only partial data
transferred and to reconnect the BUS later for finishing the data
transfer.  Such a disconnection must be achieved using rules that allow
the initiator to expect the BUS disconnect at a predictable time, i.e.: 
- The target sends a SAVE DATA POINTER to the initiator
- The target sends a DISCONNECT message to the initiator
- The initiatior then expects the device to disconnect the BUS 
  after it has deasserted the SCSI ACK signal.
A device that disconnects the BUS (release the BSY and SEL signal) when
the initiator does not expect it to do so means that a severe error that
cannot be reported using the normal SCSI protocol error reporting rules
has been detected by the device. This one is an unexpected disconnection 
and can happen at any time whether the device has been granted
disconnection priviledge for the transfer or not.
> Also, what do you mean by "disconnect being to hard"?
Normally, SCSI devices shall release all SCSI signal after the BSY and SEL
signal have been false for a bus settle delay = 400 ns.
I just imagined the device dropping all the signals without following this
rule or some very weird problem happening on the bus.

But you can check it easily. :)
