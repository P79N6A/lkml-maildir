Yes. But we could have some silly bug in the Linux drivers too, if some
part of the driver reads back the sector count and doesn't do the 0==256
conversion. So let's not blame the disk quite yet. Although it would be
interesting to hear if the problem only happens for a specific disk or
manufacturer...
