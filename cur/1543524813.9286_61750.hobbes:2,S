Hello,
is it possible to have a socket inside a kernel driver? I mean, I want
to write a network driver that would encapsulate IP packets in UDP. The
interface would receive and transmit packets via the UDP socket's
sendmsg and recvmsg. I looked at cipe driver, which does similar thing
with encryption, and they use a socket provided by a user-space daemon.
I wonder if it's possible to have a kernel thread instead.
