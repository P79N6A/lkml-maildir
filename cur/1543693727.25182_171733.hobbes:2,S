Oh, okay, this sort of thing is supported by industrial boxes? 
Interesting... Live and learn I spose ;-) (You're right, I'm not 
familiar with industrial boxes at all.  My experience is with mostly 
desktop computers, laptops, and some entry-level servers)
Hotplug RAM I could see would be possible, but hotplug CPUs?  I spose if 
you've got a multiprocessor box, you could swap them one at a time, but 
my thinking is that this would cause issues with the OS as it wouldn't 
be expecting the CPU to suddenly disappear.  Problems would be even 
worse if the old and new CPUs were of different types too.
Hotplug RAM would also be interesting, but then again, I spose the 
procedure would be to alert the kernel that the memory area from byte X 
to byte Y would disappear, so it could page that out to swapspace.
Anyways, I don't profess to be any hardware/software/kernel guru, I had 
never heard of this level of hotplug, and it struck me as unusual.
