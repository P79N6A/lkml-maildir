I no longer have these outputs handy, although a bug report on
launchpad.net might have it (linux-source-2.6.20 package).
It was an abnormally huge value (hence the exposed signed extension
problems I fixed). The incorrect value was always the same for the same
controller/drive pair. It was not specific to a drive model, only
sata_nv (and I think pata_amd) was common to these cases.
Due to the extreme proximity of this bug being exposed to our release
deadline, we did not investigate the absolute cause of the issue, just
implemented a safer HPA detection to avoid them. If you have a sata_nv,
it is easy to get these values even with my patch since it outputs a
warning with the incorrect read back from SET_MAX. So the problems wont
go unnoticed.
