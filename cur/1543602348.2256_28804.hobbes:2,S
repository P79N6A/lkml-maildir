Only setiathome was really running whilst the rest of processes just where
in D state; the IDE disk never seemed to stop.
Once I stopped the CPU hog (that's seti) kapm-idled ained the CPU, but
again the swap was not being used but for a few Kb (about 2M maximum).
The problem seems to be related in pages not moved to swap but being
discarded somehow and reread later on.... just a guess.
If you need any debugging just tell me what and I'll give it a try.
