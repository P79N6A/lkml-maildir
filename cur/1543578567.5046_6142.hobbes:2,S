If you do that please #ifdef SMP all the changes. Its impossible to use a modem
and an ne2K together on a typical PC otherwise. The copy from the NE2K with
irq disabled is just _SO_ slow you drop bytes continually.
I did all the horrible magic in the ne2k driver for a reason. The other 
alternative is to provide a way to force the system back out of apic mode
so the ne2K driver can do a
	goodbye_apic_crap()
type call
