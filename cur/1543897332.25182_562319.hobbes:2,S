Hi
From looking at the default_do_nmi code in traps.c it seems that (at
least for the non BSP case, with reason=0) the die notifier chain gets
called with val=DIE_NMI_IPI.
However in the profile_exceptions_notify_handler we check for DIE_NMI
(and not DIE_NMI_IPI) to decide if we want to cycle through the
counters. This seems wrong to me unless I am missing something (which
must be the case, otherwise this code is broken :).
Can anyone help me understand this ?
Thanks
