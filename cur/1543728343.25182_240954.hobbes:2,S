CKRM with its current interfaces is ready for a spin in the -mm tree 
today. But if we go with the split controllers idea, we'll be delayed 
by two or three months (the changes to the codebase are not very large 
since we internally do have quite a bit of separation between the 
controllers...its mostly an interface issue).
I would estimate that the following will be available in two-three months:
CKRM framework with per-controller modifications suggested
1 version each of the controllers
classification engines
Please note that acceptance of CKRM the framework is not tied into 
acceptance of any particular CKRM controller or the classification 
engines (that was one of our objectives !). So its quite possible that 
only the framework and the least intrusive controllers will be found 
acceptable for -mm inclusion initially and we are asked to keep 
iterating on the others based on suggestions.
