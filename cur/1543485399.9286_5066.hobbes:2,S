Hi there.
I have to admit that I'm puzzled by this, and I don't know where else
to ask, so here goes...
One of my interests is in MUSH's (Multi-User SHells), and in relation
to one of them that I'm a regular on, I run what's called a bot that
pretends to be Eliza the Psychotherapist.
Since the current version thereof sometimes runs away with processor
time, I decided to 'nice' it to a low priority - and this is where the
problems started...
I can RELIABLY cause Eliza to coredump by simply running the following
command:
 Q> nice -n 15 bot Amush.CX 4190
Note that "-n 15" as that is CRITICAL - any value other than 15 (at
least, those in the range 5 to 19) and Eliza runs fine - I'm currently
running her with 16 instead of 15 - but with 15 there, she coredumps
every time...
For reference, ver_linux produces the following:
