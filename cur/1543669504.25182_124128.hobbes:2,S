Hi Wolfgang, when you say you see more problems with gcc-3.x
compilers, what is x?  I'd understand if you saw problems
with gcc-3.0.*, but I had hoped that gcc-3.2.2 would compile
good kernels for ppc.
(Me, I'm still using Montavista Linux 2.0's gcc-2.95.3 to build my ppc kernels,
but am looking for an excuse to switch to gcc-3.2.* or gcc-3.3.*.)
