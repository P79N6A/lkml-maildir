I'm using BIOS dated 19/07/2000, last week it was latest BIOS on Gigabyte
site for 6VXD7 (two PIII/800). I did not looked for updates today yet.
I tried to change C2P Concurrency & Master (en/dis), AGP Mode (1x/2x/4x),
Power mgmt - Display Activity (monitor/ignore), PNP OS (yes/no)
(24 combinations total), but any combination dies if there are read
accesses to videoram during startup. Today I finally digged out some 
old ISA VGA (Realtek), plugged it in and - it dies too. So it does not 
depend on bus type.
