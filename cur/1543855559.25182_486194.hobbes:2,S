Hi, yesterday I have done a "yum -y update" and have installed rt7. 
I test it with success, boot without notsc, don't loose any timer ticket
and found a second new clocksource, tsc. Now I have apci_pm, jiffies and
tsc.
so now for the first time I have a kernel that can boot without boot
options (and without major problems) .
Thanks,

I don't know how you work with gits, but could be a good idea, if you
split Linus gits of rts patches, I don't know if it is difficult, it is
just an idea.
Thanks,
