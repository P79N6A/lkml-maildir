Now that I've been pointed to the thread I can comment on it.
Yes, this approach makes a lot of sense.  Programs which shared syn
objects without declaring them correctly are broken and deserve to
fail.  It would be quite a lot of change in libpthread but it's
manageable.
I haven't tested the code nor will I likely do until I get a Fedora
kernel with it.  So, convince DaveJ to take it for testing.
