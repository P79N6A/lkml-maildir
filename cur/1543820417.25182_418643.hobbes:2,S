Subject: [patch 0/2] kref debugging (retry)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch series enable to detect kref_put() with unreferenced object,
and split all kref debugging checks into new config debug option.
I can find many places where I can replace refcounter with kref by doing
"grep -r atomic_dec_and_test linux/".
If we have this detection of kref_put() with unreferenced object,
The work of kref convertions would be more than code cleanup and
consolidation.
