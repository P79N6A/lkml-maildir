Did you upgrade your util-linux package recently and do
you have /etc/mtab symlinked to /proc/mounts?
I noticed a similar problem (with user-mountable CD-ROM
devices and linux-kernel v2.2) and found a change in
util-linux/mount/umount.c which might be responsible for
it. If so, it is IMHO not a kernel issue, anyway
I didn't have the time to further examine the problem yet,
though...
