I'm setting up a new computer with a 60gig maxtor. I'd like a 100meg /boot at
the very top of the disk to get around 1024 cylinder bios restriction with out
have to do anything special. This has to be as vanilla as possible.
After fdisking the disk the way I want it, when I try to mkfs.ext2 the first
partition I get this message: mkfs.ext2: Attempt to write block from
filesystem resulted in short write zeroing block 262576 at end of filesystem
In all my time on linux, I've never seen this one before. Any tips? The
partition giving this message is the first primary, 256meg on that drive. I've
tried specifying no reserve, blocksize=1024 and no change with the message.
