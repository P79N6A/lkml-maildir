Hmm.. I'm gratified, but a bit suspicious. I'd not have expected it to be
noticeable on a kernel compile (that's a 1%+ change in total system time,
which considering all the file ops etc that a compile does means that it
would have to have made quite a big difference for the pipe case).
So your data is intriguing, but it looks a bit _too_ good to be true ;)
Random things like page cache placement (and thus cache effects) might 
also account for it. But hey, if true, that's quite an improvement.
(Of course, anything the kernel does tends to be totally drowned out by 
allt eh actual user-level work gcc does, so in the _big_ picture the 1% 
change in system time means almost nothing. So even "good news" doesn't 
actually matter in this case).
