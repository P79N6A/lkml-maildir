You have the sysctl id number for this purpose and the /proc/sys/fs file
name is right now unique. So there is no need for more
treatment here then just trying to stick to what we get once it's there.
The versioning of syscall returns I will just preserve.
Going through sysctl *will be much easier* in code
then fs lookup of the file above.
