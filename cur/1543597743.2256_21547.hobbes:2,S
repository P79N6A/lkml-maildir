i'd just thought i'd verify that usb-uchi seems to be causing
some havoc on SMP boxes.
i've had complete crashes (Alt-SysRq-s doesn't respond) when i
try to print stuff to a USB printer using the usb-uchi and
printer modules.  this is on an SMP box.
however -- 2.4.2 works perfectly for that.  it broke from 2.4.4
onward (tried 2.4.[5-7], i'm presuming .8 hasn't fixed the
problem.)
if anybody wants me to help them diagnose the problem, i'd be
more than happy to, but i'm not sure where to start at the
moment.
