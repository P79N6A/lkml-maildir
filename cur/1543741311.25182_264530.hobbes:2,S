+config USE_CRYPTOLOOP_DEFAULTPASSPHRASE
+	bool "Use default passphrase for cryptoloop"
+	depends on BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP && NVRAM
In that case, you probably wanted:
	depends on BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP && NVRAM && EMBEDDED
	default n
It's just *too* fragile otherwise.
Remember - just because you don't want people to muck with the BIOS settings
doesn't mean that they won't.  And when they do, they probably won't remember
the warning they may or may not have read closely when they built the
kernel many moons ago.....
