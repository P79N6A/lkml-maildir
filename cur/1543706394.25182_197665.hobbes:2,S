yes, this happens on ia64 and it may happen on x86-64 too.

this is possible too.

why this clearpagenosave? looks superflous, you're not doing it in the
normal zone anyways.

this won't work right, __nosave_begin isn't a preprocessor thing so it
will be ignored when you uncomment it. You probably can use #if 0
instead and a comment near __nosave_begin to turn it to 1 when enabling
the suspend code.

except for the above two nitpicks, the patch is correct and needed for
safe suspend IMHO. 2.6 seems to miss this thing too, why not add it to
2.6 first?
