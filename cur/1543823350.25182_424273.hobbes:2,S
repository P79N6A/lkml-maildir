mm/vmscan.c: In function ‘remove_mapping’:
mm/vmscan.c:387: warning: unused variable ‘swap’
Ok so if we fix it by making swp_entry_t __attribute__((__unused__) we break 
swap migration code?
If we make swap_free() an empty static inline function then gcc compiles in 
the variable needlessly and we won't know it.
For the moment let's continue putting up with the warning.
