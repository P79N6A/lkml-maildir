However, three months is _far_ too long.  Look at what is happening
post-2.6.14?  There's loads of really huge changes going in which
were backed up over the last two months.
Continuing like this will just push the release of each kernel further
and further out as there's more stuff merged during the mayhem than
can possibly be properly reviewed and tested.
Shorter release cycles means that there's less mayhem, which in turn
means more time to review.
