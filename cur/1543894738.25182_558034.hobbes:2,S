So if Linus wasn't entirely clear to begin with that he wanted GPLv2
only, then that is just too bad?  Well why not then say that if the
GPLv2 didn't say that what Tivo did was bad, then too bad, you can't
change your mind later.  The FSF can't have it both ways.

No the GPLv3 is not the only solution.  Perhaps a GPLv2.1 that is
actually in the spirit of the VPLv2 with just enough changes to fix the
real problems, that may in fact be a solution.  The GPLv3 is very much
not the only solution.  A totally different kernel specific license may
even be an option.  There are many options, most of them just happen to
be pretty hard.
