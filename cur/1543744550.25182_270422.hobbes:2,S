Ahhh y'see it's by BUILD_INTERRUPT magik;
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S defines BUILD_INTERRUPT, then includes;
include/asm-i386/mach-default/entry_arch.h which does;
BUILD_INTERRUPT(error_interrupt,ERROR_APIC_VECTOR)
Which results in the IDT stub being created for ERROR_APIC_VECTOR
Neat huh? ;)
Regarding your error, has the IOAPIC resumed when you get there?
