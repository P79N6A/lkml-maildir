I did once.  Seemed fine for a while then it hit problems
(don't recall specifics) with some files.  Very painful
transitioning active filesystems.  Since then practically
every new version has claimed to have fixed NFS.  I'll wait
until the fix doesn't need to be fixed again for a few revs.

Dunno,  I assume so.  It is a pretty obvious bug by the time
i had a server running JFS the kernel i was running was
already old.
If you are running JFS it is easy to test.  Just create a
directory with some files in it and rename or delete one so
the block count of the directory is unchanged and look at
the mtime.

I see too many reports of lost files and ext3 running in a
degraded state unnoticed to trust it.  The features list is
great but there are just too many bugfixes between kernel
versions in production and HEAD.  When i've XFS, reiserfs
and JFS to choose from the need for ext3 just isn't there at
this time.  The added confidence of data journalling on
systems that don't crash just doesn't outweigh doubts caused
by reports of silently lost files. (look further down the
other branch from the message to which this is a reply)
I appreciate the work that has gone into ext3 and have some
hopes that in time it may get past any real or imagined
deficiencies.  I suspect that the biggest value of ext3 at
this time is as a labratory for testing filesystem theory
and new features.
