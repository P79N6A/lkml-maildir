Yes, of course.  Since 99% of the drivers are completely irrelevant for 
paravirt, and 99% of the udelays are in drivers, there isn't much point 
to auditing a bunch of code we're not even going to be affected by.  The 
default case for udelay is it is not needed.

What ludicrousness is this?  Hidden what?  That the default case for 
udelay is that it is not needed?

Save the time of doing a useless full audit and making sure we didn't 
accidentally redefine or misspell some symbol on a bunch of 
architectures we aren't even set up to compile for.

That's inconsistent.  We would be doing 2 SCSI drivers, part of the IDE 
code, some i386 arch code, some random places in the kernel... and now 
nobody else knows whether to use udelay or hardware_udelay and the code 
gets jumbled to the point that it is useless because there is no clear 
distinction between the two.  It is non-trivial to come up with a list 
of source files that we have to actually do this to.  One C-file calls a 
shared routine in a library, and now you've got a hidden udelay that you 
have absolutely no way of detecting.  The right thing to do if you want 
to do it on a line by line basis is exactly the opposite.  Remove udelay 
and find out what breaks.  Bugs are easier to find and fix than hidden 
code.  If I were to do it on a line by line basis, I would chose to 
replace udelay() with real_time_udelay() for those places that actually 
need it.
