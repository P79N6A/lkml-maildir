I think it's more than just descriptive and neat.  A common sneaky bug
is to accidentally pass &list->next into list_entry() instead of
list->next. This is easy to do because one is used to typing &list in
list_empty(), etc.  So by following ->next in the macro we make the list
argument consistent in list_empty() and list_first_entry() and hopefully
reduce the risk of making that mistake.
I like it.
