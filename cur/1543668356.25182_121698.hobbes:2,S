   I'm seeing filesystem corruption on a number of intel SE7501wv2's 
under 2.4.21-pre5-ac1.  The systems are running Cerberus (ctcs).  They 
fail the kcompile, and memtst tests.  
   At 1st I thought it was memory, but the systems are fine under 
memtest86, and the Cerberus memtst failures disappear if I turn off my 
swap devices.  The kcompile failures seem to point to  random file 
corruption from copying the kernel tree.  (Cerberus copies a new copy of 
the kernel for each compile.)
  I suspect the aic79xx driver as:
1)I've running ctcs with the same kernel on 100+ SE7501wv2 with ide drives.
2)This occurs under reiserfs, and ext3.
3)I've been using 2.4.21-pre5-ac1 to burnin systems for quite some time.
