It's not.  In fact, I don't really see that implication either.  There's
lots of drivers hidden under a CONFIG_PCI check, but nothing under an
ISA check.  From ~line 104 to ~136 I suspect are all non-PCI and non-ISA
chipsets.

unless EXPERIMENTAL and (((X86 or PPC or SPARC) and PCI) or ARM)
Since the experimental tag I believe would be a global thing, and I'm
thinking that ARM probably implies !PCI (since it does so often, but I
don't know for sure..).

Not typical than, but it could/will happen, from arch maintainer Y.
