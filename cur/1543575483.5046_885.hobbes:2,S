The /sbin/hotplug script I sent around last week avoids this by doing
its work in the background.
I see the underlying problem here as being that network hotplug hooks
are called at the wrong time ... because they are piggybacking onto
existing APIs, which weren't designed for hotplug support.  Different
aspects of that root cause were all over your list of problems (seeming
to trigger all the nastiest ones :-).
To my way of thought (I don't claim expertise in Linux networking!)
the _clean_ fix here is accept that the network driver API needs an
update for hotplugging.  Not a big one, I suspect.  Likely we can
start with a "ready to open this device!" call, which hotplug-ready
network drivers call at the end of their PCI or USB probe routines.
We've needed such changes in both PCI and USB driver APIs ... suggesting
that such changes are to be expected as new subsystems start to learn
how to autoconfigure themselves.

Sure.
