Hello.  The current tulip driver in 2.4.5 and up no longer works with my
'tulip' ethernet card.  0.9.14 (what's in prior to 2.4.5-pre6, iirc) works
fine with the card, as does de4x5.  Version 0.9.15-pre5 (2.4.6-pre8) and
1.1.8 (from sourceforge) both don't work.  The card is:
01:15.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21140 [FasterNet] (rev 22)
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 96, IRQ 58
        I/O ports at 0400 [size=128]
        Memory at 80080000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
        Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled] [size=256K]
The error(s) are as follows, for both 0.9.15-pre5 and 1.1.8:
Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.15-pre5 (June 16, 2001)
