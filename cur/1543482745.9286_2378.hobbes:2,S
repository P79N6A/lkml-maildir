So what makes block devices so special?
_I_ think that block devices are the _last_ thing you should do this for. 
A normal user doesn't have access to a block device, so it cannot be
exploited by normal users being nasty anyway. 
In short, this looks like special-casing a generic problem, and choosing
the wrong special case at that.
