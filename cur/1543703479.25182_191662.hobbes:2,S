NO! NO!  This prevents development of an AMD embeded system on an
"ordinary" machine like this one (Pentium IV). The fact that the
timer runs at a different speed means nothing, one just sets the
workstation time every day. Please do NOT do this. It prevents
important usage.

There are no such different "optimizations" for ELAN.
