But you can set allowed to ~0; forced to 0 for normal executables and
~0 to setuid root executables. BTW we should probably make forced set
being honoured iff executable is suid root.

PS: When I think of it, there's an easier way. Trash forced set. It is
not neccessary.
If you want to elevate some priviledges, make it setuid 0 (that will
give it all capabilities) and you can now copy forced into
allowed. You are done. You have nice compatibility (ls) for free, and
you have 32 more bits for your use!
