Please see Rik's suggestion and my followups where we are talking about
handling this in the MM.

But invalidate_inode_pages is (usually) just trying to do exactly that.
It doesn't work.  Anyway, what if you have a 2 gig file with 1 meg

With the mechanism I described above, that would just work.  The fault
path would do lock_page, thus waiting for the IO to complete.
