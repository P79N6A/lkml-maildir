The usb-ohci driver, widely used on non-x86 platforms, has hit
the same issue.  (Including on some ARM setups.)  An EHCI driver
(usb 2.0, 60 MByte/sec) under way has it too.
The alternative of having every device driver implement their
own simplified (?) kmem_cache code would just seem wrong; it'd
certainly be the cause of lots of bugs.  Simplest to just let
the kmem cache code reach into a different page pool, and make
drivers init their kmem caches appropriately.
I'd hope such a thing wouldn't need to wait for the 2.5 tree to
branch, since using 2.4 effectively on some non-Intel architectures
will require wider use of the pci_{alloc,free}_consistent() stuff.
