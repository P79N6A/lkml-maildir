Is this the general opinion? - Should I try to get a replacement 
motherboard of the same type?
If so, can anyone confirm that the sata_nv-driver is working with the 
Gigabyte GA-N650SLI-DS4 motherboard at all / have anyone been successful 
with this MB? How about the MCP51 SATA controller? - Can anyone confirm 
that the driver is working for this HW? I would feel awkward to try to 
claim a warranty replacement if it is proved that the HW is OK after 
all, and the problem is with the linux-driver...
