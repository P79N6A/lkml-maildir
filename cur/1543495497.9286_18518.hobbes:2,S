MAX_SWAP_BADPAGES is a limitation of the swap format 2,
it's not a kernel limitation. (check include/linux/swap.h)

There is another problem with this line:
set_blocksize() also means that the previous block size
doesn't work anymore:
if you accidentially enter 'swapon /dev/hda1' (my root drive)
instead of 'swapon /dev/hda3', then you have to fsck:
sys_swapon sets the blocksize, then it rejects the call
because there is no swap signature, but now ext2
can't access the partition (blocksize 4096, ext2 needs 1024).
I've posted a patch a few weeks ago, but I received no reply.
Are such problems ignored? (The super user can crash the
machine at will, one more crash doesn't matter)
