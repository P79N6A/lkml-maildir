Maybe.  Or maybe two independent graphics contexts in the same chip, or 
any number of other solutions.
This isn't a serious technical hurdle.  If nothing else, we can stick a 
bridge between two chips and the bus.

The economics are much more complex than that, although I don't really 
understand them well.  What you're asking for is a niche product and is 
subject to niche pricing.  It will sell for what the market will bear.
Products like this may have to have a higher profit margin, in order to 
make up for slimmer margins on more commodity products.  But don't quote 
me because I'm officially clueless on this topic.  :)

Quite true.  :)
