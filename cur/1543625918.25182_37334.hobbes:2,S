Okay, updated patch for this is below.  I also added a printk to give us 
which mmap operation was invoked to aid in debugging.

Ah, right.  I disallow MAP_FIXED addresses that are not the "correct" offset, 
so this case would fail, albeit with the do_munmap occurring.  Personally, 
I would rather see an mmap fail if it would collide with an existing mapping, 
but that might break some applications.
Thanks for looking this over.  Cheers,
