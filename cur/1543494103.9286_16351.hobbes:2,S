The special files in /dev are just a 'trick' to associate a major/minor
number with a file-descriptor. So, if you attempt to open one of
these devices on a remote node using, say, a remotely-mounted file-system,
the open will fail unless the device is local.
That said, it is of course (in principle) possible to access the
remote device. It could be done using a daemon much like the NFS
daemon. The daemon performs functions on behalf of a remote user
via a socket/port combination for communication.
Of course you will have to write both the server and the client
yourself. There is already such a device on most Sys-V systems
called `rmt` (man rmt). It was designed to manipulate tape drives
remotely. It may be possible to use it directly from a suitable
script.
