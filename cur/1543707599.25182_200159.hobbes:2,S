I'd argue (again) that having a complex glue layer is not evidence
per se of the glued module being a derived work.  If anything,
it is evidence to the contrary.  But it depends on the circumstances.
The question for GPFS itself is whether it was modified to run with
Linux, and how it was modified, and how much it was modified.
If your argument is that Linux, after being modified with the glue
layer, is now a derivative work of the glued module, that seems
more likely.  I'm not sure how the GPL reads on that case.
