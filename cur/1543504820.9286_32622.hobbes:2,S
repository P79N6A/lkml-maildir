current->mm cannot be NULL (else the kernel would
oops all over the place, since it would be dereferencing
a NULL pointer to get at the processes memory).
Most likely, you are either trying to use this from
inside an interrupt (outside of the context of a task),
or you tried to compile a module and install it in an
SMP kernel, but you forgot to define __SMP__.  You can
do the latter by adding -D__SMP__:
gcc -D__SMP__ ....
Don't feel too bad.  I had this same problem too :-)

This should be correct.  In 2.2.9 there is a character
driver (bttv???) that have a static function uvirt_to_phys.
You might snag it.  I think it does what you want to do.
virt_to_phys, AFAICT, converts a kernel virtual address
to a physical.  There is a difference between kernel
virtual and user virtual, since with the latter, you have
to do a page table lookup.  Make sure you mlock the buffer, as
it might not be present when you go to write/read on it ...
Hope this is helpful.

Christopher Boyd
