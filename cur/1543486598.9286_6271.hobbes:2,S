Hi,
I forward ported Bill Hawes' memory defragmenter to 2.2 (as exercise in
understanding mm).  If someone thinks that they're seeing fragmentation
problems and wants to try it as a diagnostic, drop a line. It works, but
should only be applied to BIC DISPOSABLE experimentation boxen.
I tested it by booting with 16meg of ram enabled and running a make -j3
bzImage while simultaneously playing with mpg123 and blasting my (dinky)
network, but that's no guarantee it won't blow up.
