As stated you cannot protect arbitrary code this way, as you are trying
to do.  I do not think you've broken any of the current code, but I
cannot tell.  You're certainly going to surprise unsuspecting future
authors.
Can you really not figure out the module owner of the sysfs entry to inc
its use count during this procedure?  (__module_get()).
Rusty.
