Ok, I forgot about 64bit machines. BTW also your '20-' is obviously
_wrong_ because you are supposing that sizeof(long)-sizeof(short) is 2.
So this seems to me the only _ugly_ solution:
--- 2.3.17/include/linux/kernel.h	Wed Sep  8 18:18:56 1999
+++ kernel.h	Fri Sep 10 14:13:09 1999

 };
 
Anyway it's clear that such structure is very _bad_ designed w.r.t. 64bit
archs.
