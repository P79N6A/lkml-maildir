Hi!
I've been evaluating kernel 2.6.0test3 on my Acer TravelMate 260 Laptop, it
is a PIII Movile at 1GHz with intel chipset (i82801+i830M) 256 Megs of RAM.
There are some weird old problems, like the yenta problem, the problem with
the cardbus interface is that you have to insert the card twice so that it
notices the card is in, everything else seems ok, on 2.4 there is the same
problem, so I'm using the pcmcia-cs i82365 driver which is working
perfectly. This is what the 2.6 yenta driver says on startup:
Yenta: CardBus bridge found at 0000:01:09.0 [1025:1024]
Yenta IRQ list 02b8, PCI irq10
Socket status: 30000007
This is what lspci tells about the cardbus interface:

The ALSA problem is new, ALSA for 2.4 (0.9.4) is working perfectly, but the
2.6.0 driver doesn't allow me to hear the beeper sound, the pcm sounds seem
ok, but no matter what I do with the mixer, ALSA doesn't seem to drive the
beeper sound to the speakers. The card driver is the snd_intel8x0 with its
associated snd_ac97_codec, alsamixer says this about it:
Card: Intel 82801CA-ICH3
Chip: Cirrus Logic CS4299 rev 4
And this is what lspci says:
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM AC'97 Audio

Also new is the problem that ACPI is causing on the Synaptics touchpad, the
touchpad driver is loosing sync all the time, and I have discovered that
only disabling ACPI this gets solved, there was no problem with ACPI as of
2.4, but there was also no kernel Synaptics driver, however normal driver
with the XFree Driver didn't have this problems. Without ACPI the touchpad
driver works perfectly. I don't know what data can I provide to help
tracking this down :-(
I don't have any problem to test patches or try to provide more info on any
of this things.
Regards...
