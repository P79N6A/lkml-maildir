Apparently to catch NULL pointer references with array indices
(int *p = NULL;  p[5000]) 
I agree that is is very wasteful use of precious virtual memory.

Actually most linux boxes do, but with the old term for swapping before 
virtual memory (or overlaying in dos terms). They have a cronjob that
expires modules with usage count 0 (or in 2.0 kerneld that did the same)
It is a rather dangerous thing though, module unloading tends to be 
one of the most race prone and in addition not too well tested places in 
the kernel. I usually recommend to turn it off on any production machine.
In 2.4 with the new fine grained SMP locking is much much more dangerous,
nearly impossible to solve properly.
