It might not be a bad idea, if somebody just has the energy to really hunt
down the minimal set of stuff. The architecture-specific defines are the
nastiest problem: if this were to be done I would _not_ want anything
under <include/kernel> to ever include anything from <include/asm>: it
would be much better if <include/kernel> can live completely independently
(so that we can _prove_ that nobody can ever get polluted by somebody
editing the "regular" linux header files).
Also, it will _not_ fix libc5. I do not want to do anything like this
except if it truly cleans things up. Absolutely no ad-hoc cross-includes
to make old libraries happy.
