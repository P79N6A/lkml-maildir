Hi,
I would like to explore if there is a way so that I can set the order
of initialization of different kernel sub systems. The main reason I
would like to do this is because I have a network driver built
statically in the kernel which wants to download firmware from the
disk, but the IDE subsystem and root FS is not mounted yet so it
basically hangs for a minute waiting to dowload firmware and then
proceeds with the boot sequence. If I could ensure that IDE subsys is
initialized and root FS is mounted before networking is initialized,
this problem probably will not occur.
Thanks.
George.
