Yes I am interested.  Actually I started down this road looking to find out if 
task migration could be tracked and I saw that got kicked out from early

Your script could come in useful to link to in the documentation.  Rick has a 
great page but hasn't been updated in a little while (though still up-to-date 
as version 12==14) and his email bounced (though just a config error).
