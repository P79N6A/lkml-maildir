You know, I've tracked a lot of this down previously when I submitted patches
to add vfsmount arguments to the vfs_ helpers, just to get tought by Al
that this is a bad idea :)

The right fix would be to not go through the vfs.  Or even better to
remove the utter hack.  See my previous patch on this subject and the
discussion started on it.

Well, the 100% correct fix would be to rip out the braindead reiserfs
xattr code :)
Of course that's not an option, but reiserfs would be much better of
stop using vfs_rmdir.  It really doesn't need most of the checks in there
and should just call into reiserfs_rmdir instead of doing this useless
trip into vfs land.

the actually nfsd filehandle code is conceptually trivially fixable,
although with quite a bit of code churn.  As mention I'll soon submit
a patch for it.  nfs4recover.c is broken beyond repair and should just
be deleted from the tree.
