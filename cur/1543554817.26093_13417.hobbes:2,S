Now I see your point : by "." or "foo/." you mean the directory itself,
while "foo" or "foo/" refer to the link to the directory, and they are
obviously different objects... at least since hard links on directories
were introduced. Fine.

We saw it, and found it shocking for the very same reasons...

Ok, now I get it. Thanks for this much clearer explanation.
I guess that this was not a problem in 2.2 precisely because hard links on
directories were forbidden, right ?

By standard, do you imply 'de facto' ? Or does any source clearly state
this ?
