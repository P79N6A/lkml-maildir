In the HRT code time is most correctly stated as wall_time + 
get_arch_cycles_since(wall_jiffies) (plus conversion or two:)).  This is some 
what removed from the tick interrupt, but is resynced to that interrupt more or 
less each interrupt.
A second issue is trying to get the jiffies update as close to the run of the 
timer list as possible.  Without this we have no hope of high res timers.
