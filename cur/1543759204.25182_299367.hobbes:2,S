oooh.. a victim^Wtester ;)
CONFIG_AUDIT is indeed what you're looking for, in combination with the audit-0.6.5
userspace end just released.  Mailing list is linux-audit@redhat.com, visit
http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/linux-audit
 for more info....
(Currently, there's still a add-on kernel patch for stuff that's not in
the mainstream yet - but that's hopefully temporary.. ;)
