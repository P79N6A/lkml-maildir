Thanks Tim.
Volanomark is a purely yield() semantic dependant workload (as
discussed many times previously). In the earlier form of RSDL I
softened the effect of sched_yield but other changes since then have
made that softness bordering on a noop. Obviously when sched_yield is
relied upon that will not be enough. Extending the rr interval simply
makes the yield slightly more effective and is not the proper
workaround. Since expiration of arrays is a regular frequent
occurrence in RSDL then changing yield semantics back to expiration
should cause a massive improvement in these values, without making the
yields as long as in mainline. It's impossible to know exactly what
the final result will be since java uses this timing sensitive yield
for locking but we can improve it drastically from this. I'll make a
patch soon to change yield again.
