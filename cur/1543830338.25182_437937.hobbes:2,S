It's these pieces:
+		pcmd->SCp.ptr = (char *)(unsigned long) dma_addr;
+	else if (pcmd->request_bufflen != 0)
+		pci_unmap_single(acb->pdev,
+			(dma_addr_t)(unsigned long)pcmd->SCp.ptr,

On a PAE platform, dma_addr_t is u64 and unsigned long is u32, so any

I think all this does is cause a slow leak of dma mappings, and on any
kernel > 2.6.16 the leak should be even smaller, since we've severely
restricted the use_sg == 0 case.  It probably is only significant on
x86_64 with the gart iommu enabled.
