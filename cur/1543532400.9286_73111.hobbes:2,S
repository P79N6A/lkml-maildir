The equalize patch uses a random generator to avoid this problem.

Of course it is implementable somehow, the question is just whether
it is worth the additional complexity in the routing code.
My feeling is that if you want route based load distribution extend 
teql to equalize based on a packet mark, compute this mark based on 
the routing table (that already exists for diffserv/CBQ purposes), 
and write a nice frontend that generates teql/route pairs.
It'll probably give better results that using the routing cache,
because it defers the decision about which device to send to to the
latest possible moment when you see the queue lengths. Routing cache
selection occurs when the packet comes in/is generated locally instead,
which is too early.
