Not according to my data sheet. You may have been confused by the names I
picked: BackAMD should really be MBA. My upcoming patch will change the
names, i.e. AMD becomes MBA.

You just answered your question. I did it because on my system that is the
way to trigger aborts and I suspected some cards might come up with a
different default value. VIA is clearing that bit in their driver so I
wouldn't be too surprised if even some newer cards did it, too.

For testing the current solution should do. A parameter would make sense if
we come to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for regular users to
make a selection. It just might be. Maybe somebody who is more opinionated
that me would like to step forward and make that call!?

Have _you_?

No, it works just great. The problem is that the unmodified driver breaks
down as soon as a TxAbort happens. From my limited experience, MBA seems to
be rather aggressive which is a good thing in some situations (e.g. if
nobody cares that you're monopolizing the network).
