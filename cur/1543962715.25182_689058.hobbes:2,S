But this makes sense. We have/had a problem where we always rebuilded
wakeup.lds. So if you by accident have done "make bzImage" as root this
file would have been generated and thus belonging to root.
x86.git has the fix for this so we no longer do the wakeup.lds rebuild
for each kernel build and I expect it to hit both -next and -lins soon.
And I am very happy to nail down why - because having to much unexplained
issues with the build system will decrease the trust in it. And there I
do not want to go with kbuild - it helps no one.
Thanks for your feedback!
