Hi,
since the include/asm-x86 directory is gone, the include2/asm symlink 
that is generated in O= builds points to a non-existing directory, which 
the SUSE rpm scripts flagged up whilst trying to package it.
This affects at least 2.6.29-rc1.
~/Coding_nosov/linux > l ../linux-obj/include2/

drwxr-xr-x  2 jengelh users   16 Jan 12 01:08 .
drwxr-xr-x 21 jengelh users 4096 Jan 16 13:47 ..
lrwxrwxrwx  1 jengelh users   48 Jan 12 01:08 asm -> /home/jengelh/Coding_nosov/linux/include/asm-x86
I'd appreciate if this could be addressed in a future release.
thanks,
Jan
