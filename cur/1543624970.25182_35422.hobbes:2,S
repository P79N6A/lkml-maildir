In article <0C01A29FBAE24448A792F5C68F5EA47D238DE0@nasdaq.ms.ensim.com>,
you write:

Why not do:
#define LOCK "1: lock ; \n" \
	 	".section .lock.init,\"a\"\n" \
		".align 4\n"\
		".long 1b\n"\
		".previous\n" 
Then you don't need the LOCK_ADDR macro, so most of atomic.h can be
left as is. The assembler doesn't seem to care that there's a section
change between the lock prefix and the instruction that it's locking.
