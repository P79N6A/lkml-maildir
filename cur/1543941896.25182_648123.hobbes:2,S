SpeakUp and this are quite independant (though they will probably both
end up in the drivers/a11y/ directory), at least just because the way
they review the screen is very different.  Speech synthesis' matter is
the time to say things, while braille's matter is the space to show
things.
However, they share the same low-level primitives: the recently added
keyboard and vc notifiers, screen_glyph(), inverse_translate(),
kd_mksound, etc.
