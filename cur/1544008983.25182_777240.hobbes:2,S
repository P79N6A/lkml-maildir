Hi,
  I have Linux 2.6.16-17 running on a MIPS development board. The
board also has an usb port. I also have samba 3.0.28a runing on the
platform, which is used to share usb-storage disk partitions. The
system does not have any swap partition and after a cold reboot, the
system has about 154MB free
cat /proc/meminfo

PageTables: 2512 kB
VmallocTotal: 1015800 kB
VmallocUsed: 8060 kB
VmallocChunk: 1007568 kB
I have also tweaked the /proc/sys/vm entries as follows to limit the
use of page cache
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio = 2
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio = 5
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs = 1000
/proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure = 10000
The moment I try to copy a huge file (about 1GB), the cached page
count goes up and eats away about 100MB inspite of the above vm
tweaks. In some cases, the system runs out of memory and OOM kicks in.

I even tried copying a file from one folder to another from shell
using dd with the direct flag
dd oflag=direct if=/mnt/usb/test.avi of=/mnt/usb/copy/test.avi
The copy was very slow with the following results
1638660+0 records in
1638660+0 records out
838993920 bytes (839 MB) copied, 1827.17 s, 459 kB/s
But the page cache still ate quite a lot of memory close to 100MB, but
the growth in page cache was much slow. I would like to cap the use of
page cache to a hard limit of say about
Cached: 179200 kB. Is this possible and is it safe?
Thanks,
Srini
