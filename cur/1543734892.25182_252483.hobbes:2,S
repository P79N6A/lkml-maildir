Hallo everybody,
I'm not subscribed to this list! But I read the archive from time to time.
In my linux box is a teac IDE CD-Rom drive. This is only recognised when no audio cd is in the drive while booting.
Is this a drive failure, or a kernel failure?
I didn't find any other on the net with the same problem. So hopefully someone of you can explain?
