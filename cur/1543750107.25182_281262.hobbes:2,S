Let's do a little poll here to find out if it is specific to you or if
this is a problem that everyone is having.  Could we get people who
use BK disconnected to stand up and be counted?  Does this work for 
anyone?
For James, could you do a little debugging please?  Run the following
when you are plugged in and it works and also when it doesn't:
	bk getuser
	bk getuser -r
	bk gethost
	bk gethost -r
	bk dotbk
We'll track it down and fix it if it is a problem on our end.  This stuff
is supposed to work, we certainly haven't intentionally caused a problem.
