I had experimented with throttling runaway RT tasks. I use a similar
accounting. I saw a difference between counting with or without the
calling from fork. If i remember correctly the timeout expired too fast
if the non-RT load was "while /bin/true; do :; done".
With "while true; do :; done" ("true" is bash buildin) it worked good.
But maybe it's not important in the real world.

If i understand sched_clock correctly it only has higher resolution if
you can use tsc. In the non tsc case it's jiffies based. (On x86).
I think you can easily fool a timer tick/jiffies based accounting and do
a local DoS.
Making SCHED_ISO privileged if you don't have a high resolution
sched_clock is ugly.
I really like the idea of a unprivileged SCHED_ISO but it has to be safe
for a multi user system. And the kernel default should be safe for multi
user.
