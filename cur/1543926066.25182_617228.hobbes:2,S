Whose sentiment?
I've had a bit of a look at it today together with David Gibson.  Our
impression is that the latest version is a lot cleaner and simpler
than it used to be.  I'm also reading Stephane's technical report
which describes the interface, and whilst I'm only part-way through
it, I haven't seen anything yet which strikes me as unnecessary or
overly complicated.
