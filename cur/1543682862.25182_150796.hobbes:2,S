I'm sure it's a serious issue, and yet my network has QoS set up and the low
priority flows still eventually get through just fine even though it has much
lower bandwidth available than my disk controller.
I think it would be really cool to be able to control disk i/o with the same
level of flexibility as network i/o. I could see setting up cbq trees that can
key off things like whether it's paging, a blocking/nonblocking i/o, or a
nonblocking i/o. They could also see what user owns the process, and what
inode the process's executable image is.
I would just wonder about the overhead.
