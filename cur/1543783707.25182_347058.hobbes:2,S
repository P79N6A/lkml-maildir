Are you saying that the posix-file lookalike interface provides access to
part of the functionality, but there are other APIs which are used to
access the rest of the functionality?  If so, what is that interface, and
why cannot that interface offer access to 100% of the functionality, thus
making the posix-file tricks unnecessary?
