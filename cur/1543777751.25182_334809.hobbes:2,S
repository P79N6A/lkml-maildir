This depends on architecture.  It is possible under some architectures to
see the so-called score-boarding effect when reading on one processor while
writing on another when not having imposed any atomicity. From memory, I
believe this might be possible with zSeries, but I'll need to check the
microarchitecture docs. It's been a long time since I read them but I do
recall a reference to the score-boarding effect.
