"Correct" depends upon what you want to do. There is a minumum
packet-size so if you are using key-strokes (interactive), the
best interactive performance will be with ppp_deflate. If you
are mounting a remote file-system (lots of duplicate data),
bsd compression will probably work best. "equ" is a line
equalizer, not really a compressor. It helps if you have two
or more slow links.
