Yes but in this case you have just rebooted. It is like when you reboot
to change your kernel, the new kernel notice it is newer and reboot...
If it has an external firmware in the adsl chips for downloading the
linux kernel, why after you download the new linux firmware, you need to
reboot ?
I forgot to say that in case of a new firmware, you can see the upload
(and flash ?) of the new firmware with ____,----- symbol on led. See
step 6 of [1].
So why in case a new firmware you need to wait more time (about 10
second) that the case where there not new firmware ?

Adsl is far more complex than ethernet...

Ok, let's continue on this mailling list.
Register is needed to post, but I think it is worth to continue, to
clarify how works the freebox and some wrong assuptions.
