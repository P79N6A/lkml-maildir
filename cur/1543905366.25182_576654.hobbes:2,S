Yup. But two pps_event()'s on different CPU's could still race.

Yup, but the goal is to avoid races. Otherwise why bother doing any
locking at all?

What you're risking is not "losing an event" (which, btw, you should
not be, either), but a *deadlock*.

But that's nonsensical! That's not how you implement locking!
First, spin_lock() is *not* enough to protect access from process context
from access from interrupt context.
Second, if you *already* have a lock to protect any data, introducing
*another* lock to protect the same data is ... utterly crazy!

Yup, but that's okay. On UP, spin_lock_irqsave() becomes local_irq_save()
which is what you want anyway on UP.

The simplest, most straightforward, and safest, most correct, way would
be to just use spin_lock_irqsave/restore() to around all access to the
shared/global data, from _any_ context.
Anyway, I'll try and see if I find some time this week to implement
what I was mentioning ...

Ok, think of it this way -- you don't have an option. You just *have*
to use them. As I said, please read Rusty Russell's introduction to
locking in the kernel.

No, I am *not* wishing / advocating that at all. Just that you appear so
_reluctant_ to use spinlocks and are unnecessarily worrying about
contention, disabling interrupts, etc etc.
Just use the spin_lock_irqsave/restore() variants, and you'll be fine.
