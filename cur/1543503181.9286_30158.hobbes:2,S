Hi,
I have small query on using two modem sharing the same IRQ
We have two ISA modem installed ( They are on COM2 & COM4)
They are sharing same IRQ3. Mouse is on COM1, IRQ 4.
I am have some problem with that. On one modem I am browsing
on the internet using PPP by opening a device /dev/cua1. On
the second one I have opened a device /dev/cua3 and running
a telephony application.
Machine is becoming slow or one of the application is hanging
(modem1 or modem2) or is stopped. However the mouse is
working fine.
Can you suggest me at the earliest in solving this.
How can I effectively use IRQ sharing?
Regards
Girish
