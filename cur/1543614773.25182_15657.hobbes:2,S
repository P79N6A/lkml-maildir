No RAID1 on disks.
Here's /proc/meminfo within 1 minute of the box dying last night:

The HighFree value was at 2044 for the prior hour.  It went to 1028
within 1 minute of the box freezing.  Out of HighMem???
Here's vmstat within 30 seconds of freezing:
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system

Seems VM related.

  Do you have RAID1 on the disks ?
  Apparently "noapic" option helps, e.g. breaking the SYMMETRIC part of
SMP.
  You may also try "nmi_watchdog=1", if you have serial console attached
  to the box for kernel message logging (and command).

   Yes, looks familiar.  My hangups have been during high disc activity
too.
   My box is located into a place into which I have difficult access,
e.g.
   I can't use it to collect the debug data, and do magics (press reset)
   to recover.
