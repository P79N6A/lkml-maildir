I'm happy to report that the sync case and the  
invalidate_inode_pages2_range() case are the only two which try to  
rewrite 'ret'.  I audited all the call paths between aio_{read,write}  
and -EIOCBQUUEUED.
So, sure, maybe we can shuffle the house of cards a little in the  
direction away from having a fs/aio.c helper for the situation by  
simply removing the few current instances of the problem.  It won't  
scale as people add problems without knowing about the rule to not  
overwrite -EIOCBQUEUED, but hopefully that won't be a rule for much  
longer :) :).
For the O_SYNC case we could add another magical test to the is_async  
assignment which won't perform AIO on O_SYNC descriptors.

Hmm, I think I like that.  It solves the problem for the current sole  
user of -EIOCBQUEUED without too much disruption.

Hmm, yeah, it looks like I goofed that.
I'll roll a patch which does the invalidation down in fs/direct-io.c.
