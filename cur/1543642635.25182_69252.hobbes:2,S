True. It is not in fast path though. The fast path is ilookup() succeeding. 
If the inode is not in cache, then the fs will have to read it from disk at 
which point the additional hash calculation goes down in the noise on the 
cpu cycles front. But if you think it is so important, then yeah, I can 
make an inline wrapper. No problem.

You are welcome. (-:

Ok.

Hrm. True. Althought it didn't evolve that way. iget5_locked came first and 
iget_locked was done later on as a speed optimization for simple file 
systems. Al wanted to keep the _fast paths separate...

radix_tree_lookup(), d_lookup(), path_lookup(), ... Fits in nicely. (-:
find_inode{_fast} exist already, why add confusion when you don't have to? (-;
