I don't know how to express what Al says any more clearly, looks very
clear to me. One example of such is IDE, which has two drives on one
channel and the channel is the syncronization point. So it actually
makes sense to have one lock per channel, and have that lock be shared
by the two queues (drives) on that channel.
Seems to me, you are suffering somewhat from the 'more locks is just
faster' disease. This is often not the case. ->queue_lock being a
pointer is just more powerful than having the lock embedded, because it
gives you the option to make your locking hierachy the way you want it.
So please, leave the single global nbd_lock and just use that for all
queues until you have anything close to resembling real evidence that
splitting it up is worth it. I do guarentee you that for X busy queues,
the patch you sent will be _slower_ than maintaining one single lock due
to dirty cache line bouncing.
