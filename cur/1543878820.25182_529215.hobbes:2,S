No! That is why I suggest (a long ago, in fact) to move ->children into
->signal_struct. When sub-thread forks, we set ->parent = group_leader.
We don't need forget_original_parent() until the last thead exists. This
also simplify do_wait().
However, this breaks the current ->pdeath_signal behaviour. In fact (and
Eric thinks the same) this _fixes_ this behaviour, but may break things.
Oleg.
