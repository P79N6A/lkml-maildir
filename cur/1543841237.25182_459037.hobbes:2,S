This is an old piece of code.  Today we use 1 for the cmd_per_lun of
non-TCQ devices.

This is unnecessary unless you alter it before host alloc (which is
where it takes the shost values from the template).
Also, I think if you look at the rest of the driver, it's careful to
account for the need for required scbs in its internal queueing
algorithms, so the ASD_FREE_SCBS should be unnecessary.
