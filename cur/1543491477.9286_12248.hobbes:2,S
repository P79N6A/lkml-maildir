Hi,
	I was having problems with NFS. The last report I sent was the
very big spare file in NFS. Now I am getting the same spare files on the
mailboz directory when users retrieve mail using qpopper. The volume is
*not* NFS mounted and the kernel is 2.2.3
gallir@star:/home/people/gallir > ls -l /usr/spool/mail/*.bad 
-rw-------   1 jbauza   root     3221220900 Mar 30 19:11 /usr/spool/mail/jbauza.bad
-rw-------   1 marco    root     3221220900 Mar 30 01:43 /usr/spool/mail/marco.bad
Is it a kernel bug or a missused seek in qpopper? The size is the same for
both which is quite strange.
Furthermore, when I do a make on files which are symbolics links to a NFS
mounted file, I get following errors. Both, client and server are 2.2.3
and run xntpd with exactly the same localtime info.
> atlante:/etc/mail # make
> make: *** Warning: File `virtusertable' has modification time in the
future
> makemap hash virtusertable.db < virtusertable
> make: *** Warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
Best regards,
