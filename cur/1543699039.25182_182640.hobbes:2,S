What I'm on about is that some interfaces internal to arch/i386/ for
APIC management are ad hoc and the configuration boundaries and case
analysis in the code don't match the configuration boundaries or cases
of the hardware. The API has to change to accurately describe machines
in order to accurately drive the machines.
The worst offense for end users is probably the mismeasured physical
APIC ID space on smaller (mach-default) xAPIC systems which should
lose cpus with sufficiently sparse physical APIC ID's. The only current
use of physical broadcast is for clustered hierarchical serial APIC RTE's.
