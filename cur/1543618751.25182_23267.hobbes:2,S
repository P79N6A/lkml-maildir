And if you changed the int and/or the char into bool, this would  
accomplish exactly nothing. A compiler can warn about assignments in  
conditions or uninitialized variables, and gcc does it already (and has  
done so since a long time); why you think this has anything to do with  
bool seems to be completely unclear to everyone but you.

Of course, that is again not what is happening. You either *weren't*  
talking about Richie's concerns, or else you were making an excellent  
effort of keeping that fact secret from the rest of us.
What you *were* saying is that you think bool would help get warnings that  
you *already* get and that bool has absolutely no relevance to. I didn't  
exactly call you an idiot for that, but that is certainly the impression  
you left.
