Actually:
1. the kernel uses virtual memory itself and accesses its
   data structures through page tables
2. reverse mapping stuff is easy (though it costs 8 bytes
   of overhead per mapped pte, probably doubling page table
   overhead)
This only leaves two issues, the first is device drivers and
the second is the question whether we'd want the overhead
needed to implement the (fairly easy) memory relocation.

Rik
