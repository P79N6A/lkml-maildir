Heelo,
I have been watching a thread concerning the slow down
with accessing some websites but have not found a
resolution to the issue.  
Here is the issue going to kernel.org and grabbing
util-linux-2.12a.tar.bz  via ftp on 2.6.7 and 2.6.6
takes ~10s, however, on 2.6.7bk9,15,16 it takes 2
minutes:
2.6.6:
1281955 bytes received in 10 seconds (1.2e+02
Kbytes/s)
2.6.7bk16:
1281955 bytes received in 1.6e+02 seconds (7.7
Kbytes/s)
Moving files on the local net shows no issues:
622853632 bytes received in 15 seconds (4.2e+04
Kbytes/s)
Is this a known issue and is there a resolution?  Any
help with this is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Phy
