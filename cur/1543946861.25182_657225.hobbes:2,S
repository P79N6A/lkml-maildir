Right.  I'm wondering what the problems are that you see with that.
The advantages include earlier warning of merge problems, and avoidance
of duplicate commits--if Jeff's done work that depends on patches that
already upstream, then he either does that work against upstream, or
includes backported patches in the branch he asks you to pull, and you
end up with both the original and the backported patch.  Which isn't the
end of the world, but the resulting history seems messier than
necessary.
Or I guess you could both wait to do this merge until you're ready to
pull in Linus's latest?
For non-git-using testers there may be an advantage to always keeping a
tree based on the latest tagged release, as it may simplify providing
them with patches in some cases.  But if the goal is to provide a basis
for other maintainer's work, I'd've thought the best policy would be
just to track the tip of every relevant branch (which includes Linus's
in this case).
