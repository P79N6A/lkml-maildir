We've seen the same problem.  We use gettimeofday() for timing of
network-ish operations on the order of 10-50 us.  But not having
the TSC makes gettimeofday() itself very slow, on the order of 30 us.
Here's what we've been using for quite a few kernel versions.  I've
not tried to submit it for fear that it could break some other
scenario, as you suggest.  Although in hotplug scenarios, this
function unsynchronized_tsc() should get rerun and disable TSC if
more processors arrive.
At least count this as a "me too".

Subject: [PATCH] use tsc on 1 cpu smp
Use num_online_cpus() instead of num_present_cpus() as the
parameter to check when deciding if TSC is good enough.  Thus
explicitly booting with maxcpus=1 will let us use the TSC even on
a dual-processor machine.  This helps reduce gettimeofday
overheads on our dual Opteron nodes immensely (30 us vs 0.5 us).
