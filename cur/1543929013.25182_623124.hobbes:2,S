Ok, how about this:
	void kobject_init(struct kobject *kobj, struct ktype *ktype);
and then:
	int kobject_add(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobject *parent, const char *fmt, ...);
After we call kobject_init() we HAVE to call kobject_put() to clean up
properly.  So, if kobject_add() fails, we still need to clean up with
kobject_put();
That means we _can_ create a:
	int kobject_init_and_add(struct kobject *kobj, struct ktype *ktype, struct kobject *parent, const char *fmt, ...);
and if that fails, then again, you have to call kobject_put() to clean
things up, right?
Does this look sane?
thanks,
