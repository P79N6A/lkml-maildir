sure.  and there's free webmail accounts that take about 10 minutes to
setup as well as various people offering shell access to linux machines
if you ask nicely.  so this really is not an issue.  I think this is more
about ibm politics (espeically in boeblingen) sometimes making it pretty
hard to post things.  But that doesn't mean it's impossible, it just means
they didn't try hard enough.
