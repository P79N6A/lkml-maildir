Bill,
If I have received any patches from Alan Cox on this
matter, then I have forgotten/misplaced them.
The change that upset cdparanoia dates from a thread
on this list (lsml) titled:
"[PATCH] sg.c to set direction more reliably ..."
from last year proposed by Jeremy Higdon, see:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=109350427728262&w=2
I'm surprised that cdparanoia is still using the sg
version 2 (or 1) interface, that comment is relevant
prior to lk 2.4.0 (and that problem could be worked
around from lk 2.2.6 which dates from 1998).
Perhaps it is an old version of cdparanoia.

Anyway, that "printk_ratelimit()" could be replaced
by a static so that the message is output once per
kernel lifetime. The SG_IO block layer passthrough does
something like this for commands that it doesn't understand.
Even that causes email queries to me ... "how come
the kernel reports LOG SENSE as an unknown opcode".
At least this single log warning doesn't break any
apps that I am aware of.
