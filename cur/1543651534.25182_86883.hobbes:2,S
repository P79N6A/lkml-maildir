I've had LTT in my own tree for a while now.  I appreciate all of the
work you've done.
If anyone wants to use it without applying each LTT patch, my tree is
at 
http://members.verizon.net/~vze2j9fk
But beware, this is my own tree that I play with.  It has all of kprobes
and LTT right now.  It usually also has LKCD, but right now it's out
because I couldn't do the merge from the last version (2.5.44.)  It'll
be back as soon an updated LKCD is available.
Also as Karim noted, you'll have to recompile the LTT userland tools
to change the number of syscalls.  You may also have to upgrade your
binutils for the initramfs merge.
