yeah, it's not like i'm complaining - you are doing a terrific job with 
kbuild and kconfig.
Perhaps instead of outright converting it (which needs thought and real 
hard work), how about just running a quick script over all Kconfigs and 
marking old-style entries as:
  # TODO: this stuff needs to be fixed, see Documentation/blah.txt
? Should be 15 minutes of awk and can be committed right after -rc1. 
Annoying messages like that tend to get the attention of architecture 
maintainers :-) The Kconfig rules are not always obvious so people need 
help.
