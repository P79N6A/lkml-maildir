   There are enough PCI network devices, that something like 
   alloc_pci_etherdev might
   be a good future idea.
What is sos special about PCI? :-)
In this light, alloc_device_etherdev() seems much more appropriate.
But we can play this game AD_INFINITUM, for each and every paramter
that is common across a class of ethernet devices.  At what point
do you stop? :-)
