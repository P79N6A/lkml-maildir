Yes it already does that, but kernel_root_table2 is not defined when
CONFIG_SYSCTL is not set (the problem isn't with
register_sysctl_table).
With 2.6.12-rc3:
arch/x86_64/kernel/vsyscall.c: In function `vsyscall_init':
arch/x86_64/kernel/vsyscall.c:221: error: `kernel_root_table2'
undeclared (first use in this function)
If you prefer, i can send a patch which sets kernel_table_root2 to
NULL when CONFIG_SYSCTL is not set. Or maybe there a better fix (btw
is sysctl_vsyscall needed when !CONFIG_SYSCTL ?).
regards,
Benoit
