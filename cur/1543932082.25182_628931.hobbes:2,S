It won't normally though (they are put linear for each object file)
and if you really want to make sure you can always use a special section.

I'm not aware of the order of global variables changing that much.
Especially the linker seems to keep it rather stable.

My problem with profile feedback is that it will make it impossible
to ever recreate kernel binaries after the fact. So decoding of random
oopses would become much harder.
