I am a little fuzzy on how this would work, so I cant say for certain.  :) But it seems like that is accurate.

Technically you only need (2).  I run my 4-8 core development systems in the single default global cpuset, normally.  Customers typically do use multiple sets, but we only use the vanilla balanced variety.

Heh...I cant quite wrap my head around that, but it sounds like you are correct.  The only thing I was really pointing out is that the RT code doesn't necessarily look at sched-domain flags before making balancing decisions.  So as long as that is not a requirement, I think we are all set.
