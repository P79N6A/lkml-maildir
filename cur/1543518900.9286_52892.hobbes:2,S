The input part of the input patches just exports functions to register
an event handler (there can be multiple handlers for one device), and
to pass events back and forth. So, it has all the flexibility needed.
The console part of the input patches also tries to solve event
delegation, including console switching with more than one keyboard
and such, but you should ask Martin Mares <mj@suse.cz> about what
exactly it does, because he has written this part.
