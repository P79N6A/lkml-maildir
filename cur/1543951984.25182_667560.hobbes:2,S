Being polite, understanding and grateful generally encourages people
to contribute and progress. Being sometimes rude helps them understand
they went too far, and gives more credit to your politeness in normal
time because you're seen as balanced. Being always rude or always
excessively polite just assigns you a style by which people don't know
what you really think. So using all the capabilities of the language
is finally the best solution to precisely express what you think.
