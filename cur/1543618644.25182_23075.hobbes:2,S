Latency tests showed that fixed the problem as well as the cli.  It's
just _much_ uglier to read, is all.
Although it saves the cli from syscalls and interrupts, it adds back a
small cost to interrupts.  Fortunately, syscall latency is far more
important than interrupt latency.
If we're going to micro-optimise the system calls, then markers are
definitely the way to fix the return path race IMHO.
