Answer me this:
How would it get activated in the first place?
Right. By being accessed multiple times, that's how. Which you claim it
won't be - in which case de-activating it is a no-op, and unnecessary.
Now, there's another possibility: that it _does_ get accessed multiple
times, _despite_ being the lower-level cache. In which case de-activating
it is the wrong thing to do.
So we basically have two cases. And in neither case does it make sense to
de-activate the page. Eh?
