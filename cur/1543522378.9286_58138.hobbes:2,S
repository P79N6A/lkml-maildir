hi,
i have a supermicro 370swd board with the intel 810 chipset. are there any
plans to add sound support for that chipset? open sound system does support
it. . .but i don't like the idea of polluting my system with a non-free
driver.
you'd think that with all of the money intel has put into linux that they
would have a driver for it. . .oh, well. ;-)
thanks,
röbert eric pearse
