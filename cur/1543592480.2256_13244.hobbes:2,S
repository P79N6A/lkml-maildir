Rik, I threw away the parts of the patch that were bad and obvious
band-aids, and it was hard to tell whether any of your patch was a
"real" fix as opposed to just making more reservations.
And you have not replied to any of the real arguments for fixing the
_real_ bugs. You jst repeat "my patch, my patch, my patch", without even
acknowledging that others are finding the real _underlying_ problems.
Please take a moment to realize that you're not exactly being helpful.
