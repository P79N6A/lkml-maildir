Yes, removing agpgart gives me back earlier behaviour: The notebook
wakes up after suspending with following restrictions:
1. Internal NIC and maybe even modem do not wakeup
   (kernel: eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!)
   Can be temporarily fixed by restoring PCI settings with
   setpci ... (script found on linux-kernel in february)
   and ifdown eth0; ifup eth0
2. I can not use DRI since it doesn't wake up then (agpgart loaded)
3. When running X (4.0.2) mouse is jumping around after resume
   and needs to be reset by switching to console and back to X
4. Keyboard repeat-rate is slowed down after resume
Is there a way to have at least 1.+2. fixed? Is this a problem
with Dell's BIOS or Linux?
Thanks,
Daniel
