Alternatively, set up the isofs code so if it finds any audio tracks
on the CD and /proc/filesystems includes audiofs, it adds a virtual
directory called audio to the root directory of the CD with a file
entry for each audio track found, and does a hidden loopback mount via
audiofs as required...

I'll agree with that...

Alternatively do the reverse, as above...
