Per,
Interesting. My SCSI Yamaha 4416 burner also doesn't like magicdev
running during a burn by cdrecord. The effect is to lock up
burner (not the whole system). Since a device lockup leads
to an attempted device reset (and the latter is quite fragile
in the ide-scsi driver), my guess is that my Yamaha and your
Sony writer have the same firmware weakness.
Magicdev sends out a Test Unit Ready command every few seconds
and it seems some burners can't handle this while burning (or
in the final fixate stage). The simple solution is to turn off
magicdev (then your system will no longer detect CDROMs being
placed in the drive).
