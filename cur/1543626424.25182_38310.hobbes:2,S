gcc is correct.  "&array" and "array" are different.  While they represent
the same address, the types are not compatible.  Eg. for "int array[5]"
the type of "array" is "int [5]" (decaying to "int *" in most contexts),
but the type of "&array" is "int (*)[5]" (pointer to array of 5 ints).
And "(&array)[1]" is quite different from "(array)[1]".
Andreas.
