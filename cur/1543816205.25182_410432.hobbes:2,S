I'm not sure why a connector would have to be concerned with the size of
pid_t in linux-2.4.x unless it's backported since, as far as I'm aware,
connectors have not been backported.

	Yes, but the point is for an event -- which presumably is *much* more
frequent that a CMD -- the err field would be unused. Hence my
suggestion of having it serve as the mask field for event messages
instead of combining the event mask into the type field.
