OK, good to know that it wasn't a tipical IA64 problem.
As far as I understand, your solution still relies on the specific
behavior of the scheduler for distributing the tasks uniformly and on
synchronizing among migration_tasks. I'd really prefer replacing this
shaky method by the usage of migration_task on CPU#0. Thich would always
work, no matter how many tasks are around. This saves some debugging work
to those who play around with the scheduler or want to start some kernel
threads earlier...
