The ability to do this was originally requested in the context of a 
driver managing the power state of its devices (according to some 
unspecified logic); agreed that state changes requested via sysfs are a 
less compelling usage scenario.  Small battery-powered gadgets often 
implement drivers that are more actively involved in managing power 
state than the desktop/notebook/server norm, invoking LDM suspend 
routines when an opportunity to power down arises.  But it is also 
common in wall-plug-wired systems to have a few power state transitions 
that result from things under kernel control, such as blanking a display 
device after a timer expires.
In many cases, the opportunity to move to a lower-power state may be 
triggered by userspace activity and would make a good candidate for a 
purely userspace notification method.  However, a kernel-to-userspace 
notification method is suggested for this to cover potential cases where 
a device power state change might not be directly caused by, or may be a 
non-obvious side effect of, an application action.  Display blanking is 
an example; other devices that can enter a low-power state due to 
inactivity or due to changes in power state of other upstream or 
downstream devices could also use this.  If anyone reading this has 
concrete examples that they would like to have considered then please do 
speak up.
It may be the case that most useful scenarios for userspace actions in 
response to device power state changes could be handled through a 
suitable implementation of D-BUS messages between applications, and I'd 
certainly support use of that model wherever possible.  Returning errors 
through the system call interface for an operation on a device file 
descriptor, as I believe you've suggested, may also help cover most 
useful cases.  I will continue to encourage the developers who have 
asked me for driver power state notifiers to chime in here with more 
details on their needs.

I'd suggest some latitude in driver handling of low-power device states 
wrt open file descriptors, such as for display blanking.  But yes, this 
is usually true (at least in the non-system-suspend case).
