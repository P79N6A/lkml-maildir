This doesn't work, because size_t is a typedef, not a macro.

No, but as Andreas pointed out earlier, doing non-optimized builds
with the _IOC_TYPECHECK macro in place always results in link
errors, even for correct code. Since we know that the kernel
is always built with -O2, '#ifdef __KERNEL__' is sufficient
here.
The type checking this in user space is not necessary, because 
the point of the check is only to keep people from adding *new*
invalid ioctl numbers and doing the check for the kernel does that.
However, the old numbers need to be kept for a long time and there
is no point in breaking user applications that use established
interfaces.
