Hah then read LICENSE.LGPL!
"""Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs."""
If the GPL does not mention linking at all, and therefore does not
really forbid it, why do we need an LGPL to allow linking then?

I would be of the opinion that dynamic linking does not make it a
derived work, because neither the ld program nor the ld-linux.so
dynamic linker knows whether -lfoo is actually GPL or not.

And that is a major problem IMHO. If there is no definitive
[technical] answer to what constitues a derived work, and it leaves
you at risk to lose a case in court while it is a gray area.
Oh well back on the topic: A userspace app just is not a derivate
work of the kernel, for me at least.
