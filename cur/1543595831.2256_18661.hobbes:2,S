I consider them harmful when I start getting annoying patches that start
adding more and more of them.
Which is how this whole thread started.
My solution was to just move it into a comment, at which point I don't
mind adding more copyright notices, because I know it cannot annoy a real
user.
And "real users" are what matters, after all.
