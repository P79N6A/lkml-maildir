Hi,
I'd like to know if anyone has a transparent firewall that is one that 
doesn't make any rules on the traffic but only always pass it without this 
beeing notified by the rest of the network system... this should help me to 
do my thesis. I would be like adding one transparent layer between the 
network layer (ip) and the link layer (physical).
Thanks a lot
Romain Giry
