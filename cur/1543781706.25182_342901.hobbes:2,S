cdrtools is a package which includes cdrecord.  Or, the other
way 'round, cdrecord is a part of cdrtools package.  Nowadays,
anyway.

Well, yes and no.  If you have re-writable media, there's a packet
driver for it in recent kernels, and it is possible to (indirectly)
mount and use a cdrw device as normal block device.  Ofcourse it'll
only work for data "tracks", not for audio disks.
