It only happens when paging is off. Hence no problem as soon as the kernel
is up and running. -O2 changes the memory-access patterns so it is quite
possible that it would expose hardware bugs.

On 1.0 xboxes it works with any gcc with or without optimizations on.
On 1.1+ xboxen it does NOT work with 2.95, -O0 or -O2. But with 3.2.2-3.3 it
is known to work with -O0.
It's was not easy to localize the crashes. Cos adding more code for
debugging moves the point where it crashes around. However it does crash
reading from memory. A prefectly valid address. That it just a few
instructions earlier had written and read from.
