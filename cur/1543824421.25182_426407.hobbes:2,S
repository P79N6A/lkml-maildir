Not sure what you're trying to say here.  Yes, barriers are on
by default now if the hardware supports them, yes, they will
slow things down relative to write-cache-without-barriers, and
yes we all knew that ... its not the case that someone "did not
notice" or forgot about something.  There is no doubt that this
is the right thing to be doing by default - there's no way that
I can tell from inside XFS in the kernel that you have a UPS. ;)
cheers.
