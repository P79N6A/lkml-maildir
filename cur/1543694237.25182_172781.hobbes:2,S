I'm not too sure about this. It's my feeling that CPU speed and disk
throughput grow about as fast. I don't have hard figures, so I can be
proven wrong on this.
FYI: you hardly see compressed files on NTFS. If you do, it's either
because the user thought it was a fun feature (in which case only a
small amount of files are compressed), or because it's an old (small)
disk filled to the brim with data (in which case most of the volume is
compressed). In the latter case compression indeed makes things faster,
but only when using the disk with a modern CPU, not when using it in
the original machine.
