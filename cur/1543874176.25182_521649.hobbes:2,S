Not for a coding style cleanup, but that macro is Bad according to
CodingStyle, so hopefully it will be cleaned up in the future.
Things to avoid when using macros:
1) macros that affect control flow:

I don't care one way or the other about most of these, but would
you explain that one above (and others like it), please?
It's not an < 80 columns thing.  My <cough> recollection is that
many indented function parameters in Linux are indented more like
the original here, near the opening '(' after the function name,
although I suppose that none of this is in CodingStyle.
