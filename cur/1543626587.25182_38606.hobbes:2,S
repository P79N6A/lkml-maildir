Hello
I wonder what happens when somebody calls VT-ACTIVATE in close succession.
So that the second one overwrites the first one. Let's assume the first one is
generated by program #1 and the second one by program #2. And some of the programs
may be using graphics and some of them text. What will happen? Will screen corruption
and/or kernel crash induced by botched videocard registers result?
