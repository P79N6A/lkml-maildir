Subject: [PATCH] ide_cs: Make ide_cs work with the memory space of CF-Cards if IO space is not available
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Thomas Kleffel <tk@maintech.de>
this patch enables ide_cs to access CF-cards via their common memory
rather than via their IO space.

This patch is against 2.6.17-rc3
The reason why this patch makes sense is that it is pretty easy to build
a CF-Interface out of a simple address/data-bus if you only use common
and attribute memory. Adding the capability to access IO space makes
things more complicated.
If you just want to use CF-Storage cards, access to common and attribute
memory is enough as the IDE registers are available there, as well.
I have submitted a patch to RMK which enables the AT91RM9200's CF
interface to work in that mode.
