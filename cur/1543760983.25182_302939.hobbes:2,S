This seems sufficient for the simplest devices, that just have an
IRQ_PENDING and an IRQ_ACK register.  But what about a device like the
emu10k1 where you have a half loop and loop interrupt for each of 64
channels, plus about 10 other interrupt sources?  The IPR just tells you
there's a channel loop interrupt pending, in order to properly ACK it
you need to set a bit in one of 4 registers depending on whether it's a
loop or half loop interrupt, and whether the channel is 0-31 or 32-64.
