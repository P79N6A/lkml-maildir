actually ... 'class' might be an even better term than 'type', mainly 
because type is even more overloaded in this context than class. "Q: 
What type does this lock have?" The natural answer: "it's a spinlock".
so i'm strongly considering the renaming of 'lock type' to 'lock class' 
and push that through all the APIs (and documentation). (i.e. we'd have 
'subclasses' of locks, not 'subtypes'.)
then we could do the annotations (where the call-site heuristics get the 
class wrong and either do false splits or dont do a split) via:
	spin_lock_set_class(&lock, &class_key)
	rwlock_set_class(&rwlock, &class_key)
	mutex_set_class(&mutex, &class_key)
	rwsem_set_class(&rwsem, &class_key)
[And for class-internal nesting, we'd have subclass nesting levels.]
hm?
