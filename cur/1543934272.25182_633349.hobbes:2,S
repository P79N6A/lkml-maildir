We had this come up before and the header should not be exported to
userspace at all.  It documents the ufs ondisk structures which are
  a) not a user/kernel interface
  b) may change frequently due to addition of another ufs subvariant.
The only non-kernel user of this known to me is silo, which should just
have it's own header documenting the solaris sparc ufs variant it needs
to understand, possibly by using a copy of the kernel version at any
given point of time.
