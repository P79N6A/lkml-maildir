Subject: Change that to an NTFS bug not loopback

I tried to mount a 20 meg ISO from an NTFS partition mounted read-only and
it glitched.  It has nothing to do with the size of the file.  I would've
checked smaller files if I had mkisofs handy, which I didn't when I tried
it.
Now I'm afraid that it's a known bug and I've wasted your time... :(
