TSS is a Task State Segment. It is defined in include/asm-i386/processor.h.
init_tss is the Task State Segment used by the statically forked init 
process. (process 0)
Each CPU has its own tss.
This segment is used by i386 and x86_64 CPUs to store the CPU/process 
context. Could be used to have hardware context switch (not used by Linux).
In order to have a clean understanding about TSS (and more generally 
i386), you should have a look at the i386 Intel specifiction, manual vol 
3 (system programming manual)
Then, you could also read the AMD64 specification if you wish to 
understand x86_64...
