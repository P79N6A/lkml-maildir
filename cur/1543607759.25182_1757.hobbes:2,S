Some old DOS assembly sources say that this sometimes happens without
any interrupts at all - just that the chip is sometimes confused. It'd
be definitely worth printing the bad and good values when a problem is
detected, so that we know what's happening.
I've checked it, and yes, the locking is somewhat broken. The following
drivers can access the timer chip and don't grab the lock:
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/ftape-calibr.c
drivers/char/joystick/analog.c
drivers/char/joystick/gameport.c
drivers/ide/hd.c
drivers/ide/ide.c
The joystick ones are my fault, of course, and I'll fix that asap.

I see.
