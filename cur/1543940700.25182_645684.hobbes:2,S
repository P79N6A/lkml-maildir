Subject: [PATCH] Remove __INIT_REFOK and __INITDATA_REFOK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/30/248

Commit 312b1485fb509c9bc32eda28ad29537896658cb8 made __INIT_REFOK expand
into .section .section ".ref.text", "ax".  Since the assembler doesn't
tolerate stuttering in the source that broke all MIPS builds.
Since with this change Sam downgraded __INIT_REFOK to just a backward
compat thing and there being only a single use in the MIPS arch code the
best solution is to delete both of __INIT_REFOK and __INITDATA_REFOK (which
was equally broken) being unused anyway these can be deleted.

I'll send out the MIPS bits as part of my next pull request to Linus.
