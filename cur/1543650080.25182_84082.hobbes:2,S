I note that the P1003.26 ballot has just been announced...
  Title: P1003.26:  Information Technology -- Portable Operating  
  System Interface (POSIX) -- Part 26:  Device Control  
  Application Program Interface (API) [C Language] 
  Scope: This work will define an application program interface to  
  device drivers.  The interface will be modeled on the  
  traditional ioctl() function, but will have enhancements  
  designed to address issues such as "type safety" and  
  reentrancy. 
It may be worth looking at what the draft standard says before
committing to yet another interface specification.
