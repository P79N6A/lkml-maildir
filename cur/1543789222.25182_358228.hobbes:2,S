Hi,
I have read somewhere that there are some portions 
of the exec-shield patches incoporated into the
kernel.
To what extend? There are no exec-shield patches
published for 2.6.13.x yet. Is this because the
complete
exec-shield patches have already been incorporated? 
Additionally, do I only have to compile an exec-shield
patched kernel, or do I have to activate some
kernel-options, compile-options, /proc/* flags, or
something similar?
Thank you very much!
