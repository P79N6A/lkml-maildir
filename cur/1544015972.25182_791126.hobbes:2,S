Intersting.
The last thing merged into the failing branch was bjorn's _PRT changes
087da3b4e2d7d3ef70a4fa649b9a286fdeb0e44e
If that commit fails, then it is a straight shot back though
his changes to 2.6.28
If his changes work, then there is more to choose from...
b2576e1d4408e134e2188c967b1f28af39cd79d4
'merge brnach 'linus' into release'
is after I updated my tree with Linus' 2.6.29 eggnog-merge-window stuff
3cc8a5f4ba91f67bbdb81a43a99281a26aab8d77 "Merge Branch 'suspend into 
release" is my tree before merging with Linus' stuff
thanks,
