The call to ntp_scale will significantly impact clock retrieval
performance. ntp_scale needs to be removed. Could you simply let the clock
run with a scaling factor (just make sure the scaling factor is a bit
slower than ntp time and then skip a few nanoseconds of time forward
at the next correction?)
