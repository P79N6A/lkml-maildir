I do have the migration cache working against 17-rc1-mm2.  I tried to
address Christoph's prior comments.  I just haven't posted yet, as I was
working the migrate-on-fault/auto-migration series.  If one accepts lazy
migration, then the migration cache becomes more important because anon
pages can/will stay in the swap cache until the page is finally freed
[or maybe gets evicted from the swap cache?].
The migration cache still uses the swap infrastructure, so must
configure SWAP.  But, no swap devices need be configured.  Should
address that particular concern w/o major surgery to the existing
migration code.  
 Let me know if I should repost the patches.  Meanwhile, they're
available at:  
http://free.linux.hp.com/~lts/Patches/PageMigration/
 [which seems
temporarily, I hope, unavailable].  Look for the migcache tarball.
