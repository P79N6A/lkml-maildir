The boot-time switch seems to be the ideal. This would allow 
enterprise Linux vendors to support using Xen w/o having to
deal with a whole archicture release (including install kernel 
etc.). One of the (really strong IMO) arguments for full 
virtualization methods is beinag able to run stock OSes. 
At least for Linux guests, a Xen merge with the boot-time 
option would remove that argument. 
Of course, the resultant kernel changes would need to have no 
measurable impact on native i386... and be possible...
Cheers,
Phil
