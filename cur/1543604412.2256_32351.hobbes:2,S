We do not care if they use a licence which is not GPL. We only care if they 
use a licence which is not GPL-compatible.

In the case which started this thread, the non-GPL code in question was part
of the kernel source tree, and we _do_ have the source for it. It was the
BSD-licensed PPP compression code. 
You seem to have claimed that this is not a bug, but that it's intentional.
Are you therefore going to make changes to the build system so that the
static kernel image will boot up marked as tainted if CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=y?
