This EDAC patch set was applied against: 2.6.23-rc1
4 Patches in this set
1) Fixed workq reset undefined problem and found missing workq
   value reset and possible deadlock as we found in edac_device code.
   Each edac_mc control structure is scanned by a workq trigger event
   and that period valu can be modified by a sysfs control.
   This control didn't update the workq value. Now it does
2) Fixed the sysfs of the edac_pci scanning devices. Removed
   Old incorrect code and now reference counters are used on the kobjects
   and reference count on the edac_core.ko module, to keep it in
   memory until all references have cleared
3) Fixed the missing include/asm-mips/edac.h for MIPS which required
   for proper operation on MIPS
4) Fixed a 'depends on' state for the PPC_PASEMI driver.
   Was originally just PPC, but that was incorrect, and would compile
   on all PPC. Now just PPC_PASEMI builds will build this driver.
