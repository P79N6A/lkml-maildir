Subject: is there small mistake in lib/vsprintf.c of kernel 2.4.20 ?

PROBLEM:
	Hex/Octal decoding with sscanf from kernel library does not work
	within kernel 2.4.20
DESCRIPTION:
	Line 570 in lib/vsprintf.c
			14677 11. Okt 2001  vsprintf.c
	holds '	base = 10; '
	which prevents the real conversion routines ('simple_strtoul' a.s.o.)
	from decoding numbers from bases other than 10.
(possible?) SOLUTION:
	Changing line 570 from ' base = 10; ' to ' base = 0;' works for me.
	I have found no side effects up to now, but I am not sure that there
	might be some.
I am by no means a kernel professional or an experienced c-programmer, so I
hope that some of the linux gurus can have a look at this little problem.
I am sorry not to have any sample code for you, that shows the error.
I have discovered the problem on writing a small kernel module for driving
a home brewed TUSB3410-development-board, and this modul needs the special
hardware to be functional.
If there should be some interest on this kernel module for USB hard- and
software development (the TUSB3410 from Texas Instruments is a programmable
USB to serial converter), I would be proud to release this small work to the
public (including the hardware and, if of further interest, the TUSB-code).
Thanks for all the good linux code I can work with, and
Best regards
