Ohh, now it works, or at least it starts. It doesn't complain about
anything now.
And it actually works, I tried mounting an exported directory on another
machine and it works!
This is with all 5 patches you sent, I just applied them as I got them.
If you want I can try with just a few of them, just tell me which you
want me to test.
Thank you _very_ much for the rapid help.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
