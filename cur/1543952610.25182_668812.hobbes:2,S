Hi Takashi,
	Thank you for your quick response.  Your suggested alsa
commands seem to have worked.  Here is a more detailed response in
case the information contained below might be helpful.

	I would think that these new volume controls should be made to
default to whatever setting leaves the volume unmodified (usually
"100%"), to minimize disruption and to preserve support for pure OSS
systems.  I would be interested to know if there is some consideration
that outweighs this.

	I ran this script, and it only showed me the dialog program
getting a segmentation fault (probably my fault), but perhaps the
following information will be helpful:
% lspci -s 14.2
00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc SBx00 Azalia
% lspci -n -s 14.2
00:14.2 0403: 1002:4383
	Vendor 0x1002, product 0x4383 in sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c has
a pci_device_id entry with AZX_DRIVER_ATI in the extra data field.
	Also, Jeff Garzik's posting about having a similar problem
with a chip described by lspci as "Audio device: Intel Corporation
82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 01)"
appears to correspond to PCI vendor 0x8086, PCI device ID 0x27d8,
which has AZX_DRIVER_ICH.

	Thank you.  These commands give me approximately the old
volume levels.  In particular, the middle command seems to be the one
that effected the volume that I could hear.
	I hope the little bit of information about the PCI IDs that I
was able to provide above will be helpful.  Thanks again for your
quick response.
