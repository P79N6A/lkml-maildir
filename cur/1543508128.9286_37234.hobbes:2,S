sony does have a bios update on thier website; there are two versions
there.  one is v2.16, and the other is v1.39.  The v1.39 seems to be
good; the v2.16 file seems corrupted..
My VAIO has Phoenix v4.0, release 6, Sony biosversion R0113R5.  You can
get the sony version from booting up, hitting esc/F2 when you see the
sony logo.
Otherwise, it's totally busted..
