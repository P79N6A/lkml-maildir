I awknowledge the problem, but the solution cannot be found in the USB ID's
listed in the driver. The bug is the manufacturer who changed chipset while
keeping the USB ID the same.
There are 2 possible ways around this: hacking the module loader so
it continues searching for a different driver when the first driver indicates
that it cannot control the device.
Or the easiest way, just blacklist rt2500usb if you are sure you need the rt73 driver.
