Hi,
I've worked a bit more on the ibmtr case, and tried implementing the
"right way to do it", as Alan convinced me.
However, some bugs in the hardware seem to prevent this. The patch
below contains my previous attempt as a workaround until someone can
get a better workaround for the hardware bug, and it contains my
attempt at "doing it right" as an annotation how it should eventually
be done.
Alan, Could you approve of this patch to go into the 2.0.x queue? 
(Paul Norton gave me the go-ahead to submit this directly to you, 
although he is listed as the maintainer). 
Regards,
		Roger.

+   Changes by Roger E. Wolff (R.E.Wolff@BitWizard.nl) :
+        - added support for Locally Administrated Adresses 
+	  (May 30 - Jun 3 1999) 
+	  (Thanks to Uwe Fisher for sponsoring this change!)
+
+
    Warnings !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       This driver is only partially sanitized for support of multiple
       adapters.  It will almost definitely fail if more than one
       active adapter is identified.

+/* LAA means that you can decide the hardware MAC address
+ * locally. Because routing on token ring networks is based on the
+ * hardware MAC addresses, this can simplify routing tables
+ * enormously.
+ *
+ * Alan Cox convinced me that the way this is implemented here (with a
+ * module option "laa=....") is not the way to do this. However, the
+ * ibmtr card seems to dislike not being opened immediately after
+ * being initialized. So as a work around, the ibmtr card is opened
+ * immediately after getting initialized. (if you have a token ring
+ * hub (whatever they are called) you can see it come on the ring
+ * immediately too!). This however means that passing the mac address
+ * using ifconfig after initialization, but before opening the card is
+ * no longer possible. So setting the LAA using the module option is a
+ * temporary work around.
+ *
+ * In the meanwhile we can look for what in the initialization makes
+ * the card accept the open. (close/open (== ifconfig down // ifconfig
+ * up) doesn't work either, you need to rmmod/insmod the module to get
+ * the card working again.)
+ *
+ * The "way to go" is to implement "dev->set_mac_address", which
+ * allows ifconfig tr0 hw tr <laa> to work. This is also implemented,
+ * but alas, doesn't work for me.
