Correct, but it is still a hog anyways, and any benefit of the
shared libs only exists when multiple apps actually are running
simultaneously.  StarOffice is one binary if I recall correctly,
so no matter what part of it you are using, the shared libs are
not being shared.  And certainly not with the rest of the system.
I like Star, but I dumped it.  Too much of a hog.  It takes way
too much memory on my system, and I have 64M.  The system slows
down massively, and swaps.  It takes AGES to start the beast up,
and I have a 200Mhz processor.
I've switched to WP8 now instead which is much faster.  I'll try
SO 6 out when it arrives, and then see how it runs.  Hopefully
they'll switch to a Linux GUI like GTK or QT by then.
