Hi Andrew,
a few days ago I submitted a patch [1] to autosupend-autoresume 
infrastructure (and Alan Stern submitted a similar patch a few hours later 
[2]). 
Without this one-liner, all kernels compiled without CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND 
will be unable to perform more than one suspend/resume cycle, which is 
quite annoying. Would you please reconsider pushing these together with 
other autosuspend/autoresume infrastructure fixes?
Thanks.
