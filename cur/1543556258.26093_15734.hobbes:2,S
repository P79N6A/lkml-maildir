There is a mount option to disallow access to special files, i.e.,
devices; MS_NODEV. A read-only file-system defaults to allowing
access to device special files because it has to. Your console,
your virtual terminal, /dev/tty, the root file-system raw device,
etc., all have to be 'writable' before the root file-system is remounted
read/write.
/dev/special files, are not really 'files'. They are a trick to
associate a major/minor number with a file descriptor. They
cannot be 'extended' or modified because you are not writing to
them, hense `fsck` isn't a problem. The access time and ownership
may have been modified, but that is synchronous.
Cheers,
