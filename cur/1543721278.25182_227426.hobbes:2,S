in the case where 'all' wasn't correct to start with.  And i386 isn't
the convincing case here.

Honestly, I'm indifferent to this.  This problem is equally, if not
better solved by documenting in the board-specific help "and use 'make
fooImage for foo firmware"

I suppose this can clean up some of the globbing that might otherwise be
done, but I know for a fact that there's been kernel rpms before this :)

This is where I see it blowing up, quite badly.  As Russell noted,
you're going to have a horrible, unmaintainable list of boards and
firmware supported, or not, on each.  Even on PPC32 where we really only
have "needs vmlinux, raw", "needs vmlinux, for U-Boot" and "can use
arch/ppc/boot/", it'll still get ugly noting which boards can use
U-Boot, which can use arch/ppc/boot/ and which can use both.

Yes, there's that another discussion, which at least I'm not talking
about right now.  What I, and I think Russell as well, are noting is
that doing this is will make what we have in the kernel much uglier /
less maintainable.
