Sorry, I'm just basing the above on my *experience* with trying to unfsck
3 different peoples kde settings when the nfs server went down.
And since it was a controlled shutdown, there would have been no cache
worries, and the fact the kde corrupted itself points to having problems
within kde, not problems within a fs or nfs.

Well, no other program I have ever used, which does the tempfile+rename
thing, has ever failed on me.
