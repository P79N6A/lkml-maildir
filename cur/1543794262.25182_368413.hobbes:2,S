Hmm, I don't like this patch, since you never clear the buffer for reads
now. If the controller for some reason doesn't overwrite this buffer,
you could be leaking privileged data! Your bug is because you do:
        if (write && copy_from_user(...))
                fail
        else
                clear
so you end up in the clear case for any case where copy_from_user()
doesn't fail. I've fixed it up for you, this is what I committed:
