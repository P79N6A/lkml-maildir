I am not in any way argue that your driver architecture is wrong or that you
should change anything. My point was simple. [tifm_sd] can only work with
[tifm_7xx1]. If you add support for let's say [tifm_8xx2] in the future, which
would have port offsets different that [tifm_7xx1], you would also need a
completely new modules for slots (sd, ms, etc).
