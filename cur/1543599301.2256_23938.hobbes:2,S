There you are perfectly right. I misunderstood. How do you measure cost of
replacement ?

Do we need a maximum readahead based on reasonable latency of the device
in question ?
If on the other hand a task is very fast in processing its buffers the
readahead queue will _not_ be long. The task will however use a lot of IO
bandwidth. Strictly speaking this is a question of IO scheduling.
