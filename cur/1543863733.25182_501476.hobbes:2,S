qla4xxx implements slightly differently, in the sense we don't have the
equivalent of         
struct st_ccb ccb[MU_MAX_REQUEST]; 
which is in struct st_hba. In other words we don't have a local array
which like stex to keep track of the outstanding commands to the hba.
We had a discussion on this one while implementing block-layer tagging
in qla4xxx and Jens Axboe added the test_and_set_bit() in the following
code in blk_queue_start_tag() to take care of it.
	do {
		tag = find_first_zero_bit(bqt->tag_map, bqt->max_depth);
		if (tag >= bqt->max_depth)
			return 1;
	} while (test_and_set_bit(tag, bqt->tag_map));
