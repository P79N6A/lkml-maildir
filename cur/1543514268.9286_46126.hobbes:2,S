    1. The serial port will provide a flag field to indicate
       its state, with the following states being defined:
	....
Most of this state (RX-TO-TX, RECEIVING, FULL-RX, etc.)  should be
implemented in the line discpline, since it's highly specific to the
half-duplex transmission discpline.  The name of the game is to minimize
the amount of complexity that we need to introduce into each low-level
tty driver.
What you've laid out is a pretty good design of what the half-duplex
line discpline will need to do; it's where the work is done that's
critical in terms of managing complexity.
