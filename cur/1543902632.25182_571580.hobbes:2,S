yeah, you are right about __wake_up_sync. We'll likely remove sync 
wakeups anyway, and the export is GPL, so it's not a big issue.
The point remains for cond_resched_softirq() though - it's a symmetric 
export to cond_resched()'s export. (I think you should smarten your 
scripts about such 'API family' exports, to avoid false positives.)
