Maybe think of the mailing list as a moderator that's permitted to approve
binaries and only cancel binaries that were posted directly to the group
rather than going through the list?  That would seem to avoid any problems
with deleting legitimate traffic.
If people start flooding the list with binaries, I'm sure that will be
dealt with quite promptly, before Usenet even notices.
