Thank you for pointing me to the interesting project.
I looked at their patch to find that the special compressor uses
the LZF compression algorithm.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.)
So I made a quick comparison between cp, lzf(*) and gzip as
follows.  The INFILE is a file that showed the worst compression
ratio last time.
(*) A simple compress tool based on LZF algorithm included in
    liblzf, available from 
http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/liblzf.html
$ cp INFILE /dev/null           # this puts whole INFILE in a cache
$ /usr/bin/time cp INFILE /mnt/OUTFILE-cp
0.23user 14.16system 0:35.94elapsed 40%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k

$ /usr/bin/time ./lzf -c < INFILE > /mnt/OUTFILE-lzf

$ /usr/bin/time gzip -1c < INFILE > /mnt/OUTFILE-gzip-1

0inputs+0outputs (90major+93minor)pagefaults 0swaps
The results can be summarized as follows.  The lzf tool is
slower than cp (normal file copy) only by a factor of 1.5,
achieving the compress ratio close to gzip -1.
   CMD     | NET TIME (in seconds)          | OUTPUT SIZE (in bytes)
  ---------+--------------------------------+------------------------
   cp      |  35.94 (usr 0.23, sys 14.16)   | 2,121,438,352 (100.0%)
   lzf     |  54.30 (usr 35.04, sys 13.10)  | 1,959,473,330 ( 92.3%)
   gzip -1 | 200.36 (usr 186.84, sys 11.73) | 1,938,686,487 ( 91.3%)
  ---------+--------------------------------+------------------------
Although it is too early to say lzf's compress ratio is good
enough, its compression speed is impressive indeed.  And the
result also suggests that it is too early to give up the idea of
full dump with compression.
Pavel, thank you again for your advice and I'll welcome further
suggestions.
