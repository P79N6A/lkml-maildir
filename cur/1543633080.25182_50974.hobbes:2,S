* Generic BIOS:
  On modern BIOSes, there are usually several options that can be changed
  to speed up that part - switching off the memory check, the floppy seek,
  and so on.
* Adaptec BIOS:
  It's been a while since I saw that, but there's often stuff that can be
  switched in a SCSI BIOS as well. Such as which targets and LUNs it will
  look at, what options it will try, if those options can be negotiated,
  if it will try to spin up disks, and so on. Some of those options also
  affect boot speed.
You might need to experiment some to determine the fastest setting.
But beware that *some* settings can at least theoretically make a reboot  
hang that's not coming from power-off. (If the boot disk doesn't spin up  
by itself, that can usually be changed by a jumper; the BIOS should not  
*need* to spin up disks.) And turning off error checks means - just like  
one would expect - that some errors aren't checked for.
