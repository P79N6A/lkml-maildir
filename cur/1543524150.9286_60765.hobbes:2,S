My laptop (Toshiba 4015CDS) has always had this problem, but lately it
seems to be much more frequent.  (I wonder if there is an increase in
sunspot activity because my machines have all been acting weird
lately...)  On bootup, immediately after the "Freeing unused kernel
memory" message, the console starts to spit out "^[[21~" (minus quotes)
over and over and over again.  If I press any key on the keyboard, it
stops, so it's certainly not fatal, just annoying.  It's happened with
all the 2.2 kernels I've tried and also 2.3.40 and 2.3.41.
Apologies if this is a known situation, all the search engines I tried
choked on trying to search for ^[[21~ ...  :)
