	This IIRC is a gratuitous arp.  In the kernel source I have seen
references to it but I have never actually seen on used in a linux box. 
I first noticed this when moving a virtual ip address from one machine
to another.  No gratuitous arp.  Then I also noticed the same behaviour
on the "main" nic ip address.

	Would this be the responsibiliy of the kernel in kernel space or
ifconfig in user space?
