As we become less and less dependent upon NR_CPUS, it becomes more and more
viable for people to ship kernels which are compiled with a very high
NR_CPUS value.  And code such as the above becomes less and less effective.
An alternative would be to calculate stat_threshold at runtime, based on
the cpu_possible count (I guess).  Or even:
static inline int stat_threshold(void)
{
#if NR_CPUS <= 32
	return 32;
#else
	return dynamically_calculated_stat_threshold;
#endif
}
Did you consider my earlier suggestion about these counters?  That, over the
short-term, they tend to count in only one direction?  So we can do
	if (x > STAT_THRESHOLD) {
		zone_page_state_add(x + STAT_THRESHOLD/2, zone, item);
		x = -STAT_THRESHOLD/2;
	} else if (x < -STAT_THRESHOLD) {
		zone_page_state_add(x - STAT_THRESHOLD/2, zone, item);
		x = STAT_THRESHOLD;
	}
that'll give an decrease in contention while not consuming any extra
storage and while (I think) increasing accuracy.
Whatever way we go, let's think harder about this one, please.  Anything
which uses NR_CPUS is a red flag.
