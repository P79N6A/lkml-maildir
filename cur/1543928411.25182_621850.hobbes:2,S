Looks like sum_vm_events() is only ever called from all_vm_events(). 
Callers of all_vm_events():
App monitoring?
arch/s390/appldata/appldata_mem.c:      all_vm_events(ev);
Leds:
drivers/parisc/led.c:   all_vm_events(events);
proc out put for /proc/vmstat:
mm/vmstat.c:    all_vm_events(e);
All of that does not seem to be performance critical
