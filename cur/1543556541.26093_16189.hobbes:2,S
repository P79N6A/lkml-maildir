Nope, /dev/console *does* block.  ATM I've found a quick workaround - I
use "stty -F /dev/console clocal -crtscts" to turn off the serial flow
control at the stawrt of /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit - this seems to work quite
well... of course it doesn't stop some program turning flow control back
on and ballsing it all up again :)
