What is the purpose of __cpuinit?
It seems to be used for two purposes:
To annotate code that is used to initialize cpu's
  if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n then discard it after
                               init has completed
  if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y then keep it
To annotate all 'core' cpu hotplug related code
  if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n then it is not used and
                               can safely be discarded
  if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y then keep it
And the variable msr_class_cpu_notifier belongs to the last category.
So the root cause of all the __cpu* related section mismatch
warnings are the misuse of __cpuinit to mark all core functions.
How are we going to fix this?
I see a couple of possibilities:
1) annotate like hell to hide the misuse of __cpuinit
2) introduce __cpu to make cpu hotplug 'core' stuff
3) drop section mismatch checks for __cpu stuff
