Sorry, I'd been away for the weekend which is why I didn't get a
chance to reply to you.

Not quite. I think a (the) big thing with my patch is that it will
check order-0...n watermarks when an order-n allocation is made.
So if there is no order >2 allocations happening, it won't attempt
to keep higher order memory available (until someone attempts an
allocation).
Basically, it gets kswapd doing the work when it would otherwise
have to be done in direct reclaim, *OR* otherwise indefinitely fail
if the allocations aren't blockable.

Well Linus was silent on the issue after I answered his concerns.
I mailed him privately and he basically said that it seems sane,
and he is waiting for patches. Of course, by that stage it was
fairly late into 2.6.9, and the current behaviour isn't a regression,
so I'm shooting for 2.6.10.
Your defragmentor should sit very nicely on top of it, of course.
