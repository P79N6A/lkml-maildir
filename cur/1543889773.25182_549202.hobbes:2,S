sure ..basically the changes required in CFS core is the introduction of two
structures - struct sched_entity and struct lrq and generalization of
cfs routines to operate on these structures rather than on
task_struct/rq structures directly.
In the first split, I will ensure that this generalization is applied
only to tasks (which represents reorganization of core with no
behavioral/functional change in scheduler) and in a subsequent split/patch I 
will apply the generalization to uids also (which will add group fairness 
aspect to scheduler), as you require.
Thanks for your feedback so far!
