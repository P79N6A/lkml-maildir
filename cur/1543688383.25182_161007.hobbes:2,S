Dear List,
I'm in desperate need of sources of the megaide LSILogic module.
There are plenty of references to compiled module for various kernels, but
none for my kernel a 2.4.19 with various UnitedLinux errata. The plain
2.4.19 megaide module does not work.
Are there sources somewhere?
Or is the driver closed source ? (But it doesn't seem so to me)
Thx in advance,
Michael.
