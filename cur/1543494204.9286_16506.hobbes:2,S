| The saving to be made by trying to cache the data across a umount of a

| the time, the next floppy will be different.  (I can see the logic when hard
| disk partitions are involved.)

Scenario:
	mount -t msdos /dev/hdb2 /mnt/dos
	(copies, etc.)
	umount /mnt/dos
	"oops, I forgot something"
	mcopy somefile.dat d:
Are the buffers going to be correct after this?  (Probably they should, since 
the buffers are keyed by device....)  If not, then flushing the buffers on
umount is a good idea.
