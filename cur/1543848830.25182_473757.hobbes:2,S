are these modifications publically available?  i would be interested to see 
them. i've been grovelling over the header files with perl...

i noticed another potential source of unneccessary dependencies: 
<linux/prefetch.h> includes <asm/processor.h> for a total of ~49 
dependencies.  it appears that the prefetch() concept could be moved into a 
separate <asm/prefetch.h> file with much smaller dependency footprint, for a 
pretty hefty reduction in total dependencies throughout the system.
another potential win:  a good chunk of <linux/kernel.h> (which has ~24 
dependencies) actually has nothing to do with the kernel per se.  i'm 
thinking of basic C language idioms (container_of(), typecheck(), etc) and 
constants (INT_MAX).  a fair number of files seem to include <linux/kernel.h> 
just for these items.  moving that stuff into a separate file (<linux/c.h>?) 
could eliminate 20 or more bogus deps from many locations.
