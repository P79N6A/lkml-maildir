We do have nfsroot support in the kernel.  If we are going to move it
into the userland, we _must_ have the code for that.  "Use glibc" is
laughable - try to link anything statically against that dungpile and
see what size you'll get.
Said that, we don't need anywhere near the full RPC support for nfsroot
and I'm not sure that we want it in libc even if it will be implemented.
"Use -lrpc" is perfectly OK.
Stuff needed for nfsroot
	a) is purely sequential (full-sync)
	b) we need 2 or 3 RPC calls
	c) we can open-code marshalling for these
IOW, the most complex part of that is handling of timeout and possibly -
logics with retransmit.  Other than that it's filling an array, doing
sendmsg(), waiting for reply, and checking several words in received array.
