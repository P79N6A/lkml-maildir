Right. That's why I repeated several times that this is a hack and Cc'ed
James. I was either misunderstood or ignored.

If you call encrypt/decrypt without the iv parameter but use cbc mode
you will run into the same problem. This is right.
BTW: I think there's a bug in the ipv6 code, it uses spin_lock to
protect itself, this will cause a sleep-inside-spinlock warning. (found
while grepping through the source for other cryptoapi users)

crypto_tfm_size?

Yes, I thought of something like this.
