BTW, early build stages on uml with O= are still broken, even with that
patch.  The following fixes them, but first chunk is a bad kludge.
What happens:
	a) silentconfig expects to have include/linux in build tree already
created.  Normally that happens earlier, but only by accident.  We need to
force that somehow and the way I'd done it is almost certainly wrong - it
should be in top-level makefile, to start with.  Suggestions?
	b) kernel-offsets.h needs symlinks already in place.  prepare1 does
everything we need, so that dependency is probably the right thing (the second
chunk).
