hm, i'm not sure it should go into v2.6.24 without first being exposed 
in v2.6.25 for some time - symbol lookup has been historically a bit 
fragile (hopefully this will change now) , and the worst thing that can 
happen during a crash printout is for the debug code to regress. No 
strong feelings though.
