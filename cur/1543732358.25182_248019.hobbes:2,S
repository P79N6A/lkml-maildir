It makes sense if you have something truely managing your device space
like devfs or udev.

Once everyone is using udev its useful. It also works out for devices
you never "give" to a user. The problem with MMC slots is they are the
kind of thing you want to hand out to a user on the console of a machine
in many situations.

PCMCIA is very careful to create and remove its nodes and make sure they
don't ever become non root only.

If and when everyone has udev happy then yes - although LANANA is still
needed for name assignment between vendors. That or we give it to the
LSB, and personally I'd rather LANANA did it 8)
