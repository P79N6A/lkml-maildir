I did think of putting [us] after each time related column description,
but that would widen the output even more (not sure it matters that
much, its very wide already anyway).
However, the current format is microseconds with 2 decimals, so that is
basically a 10 nanosecond granularity. I do not think the extra digit is
worth much hassle (and it could be added as a 3rd decimal digit without
breaking the current format).
Also, there is a version string at the top, which should be changed
every time the output format changes.
