Hello all,
I'm trying to figure out why the fact that my USB mouse is plugged in prevents 
the processor from entering C3 state, the bus-master flag is at  ffffffff.
Unplugging the mouse solves the problem. It seems rather strange to me that 
this would influence it, since It's not used at all...
I ran across this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107633614409619&w=2
Has anyone some more info on it?
Thanks.
Please CC me on answers from linux-usb, i'm not on that mailing list.
Jan
