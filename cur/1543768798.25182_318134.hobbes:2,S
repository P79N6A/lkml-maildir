 Hello, James.
 It's been a while, but I'm finally settled with git. :-)
 This is repost of the previous scsi timer patchset.  After thinking
about it a while, the first patch seemed unnecessary as you told, so
it's dropped and the others are regenerated.
 aic79xx_osm.c DV still uses eh_timeout.  Is it gonna be updated like
aic7xxx_osm.c is updated?  If not, I have a patch to fix the eh timer
part.  I have a patcheset waiting for it to be clared - unexporting
SCSI timer as the semantics is very specific and nothing good can come
from tempering with it.  Once aic79xx_osm.c is cleared, I'll post the
patches.
[ Start of patch descriptions ]
01_scsi_timer_dispatch_race_fix.patch
	: remove a timer race in scsi_queue_insert()
	scsi_queue_insert() has four callers.  Three callers call with
	timer disabled and one (the second invocation in
	scsi_dispatch_cmd()) calls with timer activated.
	scsi_queue_insert() used to always call scsi_delete_timer()
	and ignore the return value.  This results in race with timer
	expiration.  Remove scsi_delete_timer() call from
	scsi_queue_insert() and make the caller delete timer and check
	the return value.
02_scsi_timer_remove_delete_timer_from_reset_provider.patch
	: remove unnecessary scsi_delete_timer() call in scsi_reset_provider()
	scsi_reset_provider() calls scsi_delete_timer() on exit which
	isn't necessary.  Remove it.
03_scsi_timer_eh_timer_remove_spurious_if.patch
	: remove spurious if tests from scsi_eh_{times_out|done}
	'if' tests which check if eh_action isn't NULL in both
	functions are always true.  Remove the redundant if's as it
	can give wrong impressions.
