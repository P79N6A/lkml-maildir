Are you suggesting something like this?
	spinlock_t oom_kill_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
	static inline int oom_kill_start(void)
	{
		return !spin_trylock(&oom_kill_lock);
	}
	static inline void oom_kill_finish()
	{
		spin_unlock(&oom_kill_lock);
	}
If you prefer the above implementation, I can rework the patch as
above.

I'm open to suggestions on other ways of implementing this.  However I
think the performance impact of the proposed implementation should be
miniscule.  The code added to mmput() executes only when the referece
count has reached 0; not on every decrement of the reference count.
Once the reference count has reached 0, the common-case behavior is
still only testing a boolean flag followed by a not-taken branch.  The
use of unlikely() should help the compiler and CPU branch prediction
hardware minimize overhead in the typical case where oom_kill_finish()
is not called.
