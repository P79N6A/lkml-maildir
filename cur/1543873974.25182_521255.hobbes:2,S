I like this notion very much. I should probably mention pgrp's' typical
association with the notion of "job," at least as far as shells go.
One issue this raises is prioritizing users on a system, threads within
processes, jobs within users, etc. Maybe sessions would make sense, too,
and classes of users, and maybe whatever they call the affairs that pid
namespaces are a part of (someone will doubtless choke on the hierarchy
depth implied here but it doesn't bother me in the least). It's not a
deep or difficult issue. There just needs to be some user API to set the
relative scheduling priorities of all these affairs within the next higher
level of hierarchy, regardless of how many levels of hierarchy (aleph_0?).
