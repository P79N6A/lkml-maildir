Subject: [PATCH 0/6] eCryptfs: Crypto API updates and d_count fixes

The lower d_count is not being handled right in eCryptfs, preventing
an unmount of the lower filesystem under some circumstances. This
patch set should make the d_count values sane in the lower
filesystem. It also includes changes to move from the deprecated
crypto API calls. These are bugfixes and compiler warning fixes; I
recommend merging them into 2.6.19.
