Subject: [PATCH 000 of 4] md: Introduction - some revised/reordered patches.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/27/164

Following are revisions of 4 patches currently in -rc4-mm3
which reorder the last to be the first, as that first should
go to 2.6.18, but the others don't need to.
The patches are:
md-fix-issues-with-referencing-rdev-in-md-raid1.patch
md-factor-out-part-of-raid1d-into-a-separate-function.patch
md-remove-working_disks-from-raid1-state-data.patch
md-improve-locking-around-error-handling.patch
The first one listed above was at the end of the list, and should
go into 2.6.18.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
