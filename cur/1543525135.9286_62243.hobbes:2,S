I have a 56k BTC brand HSP modem (voice capable) with the PCTel PCT388P
chipset. I understand that this is a "linmodem", however I am having
trouble finding drivers to compile in.  Is there a reference for this
modem anywhere?  I would like to use it not only for data communications
(data & fax), but also for voicemail in linux.  How can I do that?
