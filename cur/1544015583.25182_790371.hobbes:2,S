P.S.  I have a hacked make-kpkg which installs the modules via:
      make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1  modules_install
Unfortunately, I'm not using kbuild's make install builddeb since it
doesn't create the headers and debuginfo files; and the debian's
official kernel building scripts (make-kpkg has been deprecated)
doesn't correctly deal with creating debuginfo files, either. 
In any case, its make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 which is getting busted by
the two commits, and which also spike out ccache and distcc.
