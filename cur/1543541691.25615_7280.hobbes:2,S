The HFS solution has a bunch of nice properties. I and Alan seem to
agree that they are to be "design guidelines" that are to be taken
into account. Whatever you design, take into account that
	tar copyability 
	unpackability on ext2fs
are important to some people. A regular file that happens to be a 
directory too is just too unfamiliar that lots of things are going to
break unexpectedly.

Right, but it has to provide the same features that HFS users now use. 
So to me, the make it both a file and a directory solution is out of
the question. Besides some namespace issues, the ":" trick works for
me. 
Appletalk server mangles unrepresentable characters with %<hexnumber> 
(% included). It's slightly less clean, but that's how it's done. 
I still don't understand why the .Appledouble directory trick doesn't
work. Sure, the apple method only allows one extra fork, the resource
fork, but we can easily extend that.
I don't understand why the dcache would be incompatible with a
hardlink for say the "data" part of a file. We can have hardlinks on
ext2fs, why is it a problem?
Hmm. Is it that when e.g. I remove the "normal" datafork, the other
stuff also disappears? 
Shouldn't we say that when this happens, the filesystem needs to keep
the dentry cache happy by explicitly invalidating the possible dcache
entry? (because it won't automatically happen on ext2! and in that
case say the appletalk server needs to cleanup itself.)
