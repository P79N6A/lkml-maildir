Thanks. Thats all I needed to know to whack that into shape once I've
put a legacy 32bit build environment back together for this and for
something akpm wants me to fix in another diff.
Power management is umm special. The port will die on suspend/resume via
Linux (via APM seems to be ok) and need a userspace firmware reload to
come back.
