There are two issues here. One is the fact that *explicitly* unregistering 
the fd in one task and expecting the other one to act as if it was 
registered could be considered a sign of a not clean interaction between 
parent and child. The ref-count thing would not work because it is the 
kernel that automatically and directly bumps the ref count, w/out calling 
any f_op->xxxx() (like for example use/release). So epoll would have to 
hook the file get function, detect if the fd is inside an epoll fd, and 
take proper action by bumping its count. IMO it is not worth even 
considering.
