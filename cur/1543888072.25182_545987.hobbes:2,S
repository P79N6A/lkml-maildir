Subject: [patch] fix oprofile SMP ...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This fixed oprofile being broken on x86-64 SMP. The current reservation 
runs on all CPUs, but the ones following the first, will fail since the 
reservation bitmap has an 1 in the MSR entry.
The reservation code should really run once, and their addresses used on 
other CPUs. There are other solutions to this, but this is the simplest 
and shorter one that came in my mind. Tested in my dual Opteron 252, and 
working fine here.
Andi, if you don't like both Ben and my patch, would you mind fixing 
oprofile yourself in some way?
