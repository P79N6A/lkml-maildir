This is a little awkward, IMO.  page.index is actually pgoff_t, not
unsigned long.  Conceivably someday someone may want to make pgoff_t 64-bit
on 32-bit machines, for example.  Yes, that'll still work, but it's still
awkward.
Is it not possible to put the dtor address into some address-type field
within the pageframe rather than into an integer-type?
Or just leave it using page.mapping?  Anyone who uses page.mapping of a
tail page in a compound page should go oops.

hm, spose so.  Nick has a patch which unskews page.count which will need
updating for this.
<checks>
Looks like I didn't apply Nick's patch yet - mm/ in -mm has a nutty amount
of stuff in it now.
