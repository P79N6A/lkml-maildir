Doesn't seem to be worth the trouble because thread_info
is a small structure, not embedded into a big structure
as thread_struct was. DaveM removed the automatic
offset generation on sparc64 and I am thinking to do
the same on sparc.
I'm not surprised that nobody answered, the patch seems
to be rather pointless.
We might want to add something like this:
    if (TI_CPU         != offsetof(struct thread_info, cpu) ||
        TI_PREEMPT     != offsetof(struct thread_info, preempt_count) ||
        TI_SOFTIRQ     != offsetof(struct thread_info, softirq_count) ||
        TI_HARDIRQ     != offsetof(struct thread_info, hardirq_count))
            thread_info_offsets_are_bolixed_linus();
It gives out an link time error.
