That is no less true for the non-full hostname.
The fact is, a hostname is a hostname, and not "5 different hostnames". 
You're right that it has nothing to do with the IP address, but where did 
I claim it did?
If you have to have a hostname (and we do - it's undeniably part of what 
UNIX networking does), it's much better to make the hostname be a fully 
qualified one. Because it's never worse than having just a non-qualified 
one, and it is often better, and avoids the whole confusion.
