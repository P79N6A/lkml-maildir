GLptr itself isn't modified - *GLptr is, but none of the actual C code 
accesses *GLptr, so how does this affect the compiler's optimization 
efforts? Is it because gcc treats the call as a pure function that maps 
a pointer to an acquired value, and hence believes that it can move it 
around? There aren't any instances of ACPI_ACQUIRE_GLOBAL_LOCK being 
called twice in the same function, so it wouldn't be able to cache a 
result. But I agree that it ought to declare that it clobbers memory.
