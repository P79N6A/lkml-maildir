I don't know and have not used the parport code, it needs to be ported to
sysfs before we could simply call scsi_set_device() call in imm.c, or
maybe have a /sysfs/scsi/pseudo added via scsi_add_host(shost, NULL) or a
/sysfs/scsi/unported, similiar to was discussed on the linux-scsi thread
"[PATCH] allow NULL dev argument to scsi_add_host":
