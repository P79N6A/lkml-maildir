Actually the 32 pages I was talking about aren't the freepages.min but the
SWAP_CUSTER_MAX.
Anyway I think to see the problem described by Rik and actually I think it
can be fixed by killing the useless polling of 1 second and replacing it
with an unconiditional pre-wakeup of kswapd when GFP touch the
freepages.high watermark. This will in turn should also help performances
and it will try to free the cache from inside kswapd before a process have
to free it itself.
I said "useless polling" exactly because of what you said, that is a
network allocation will eat the freepages.min pages in less than 1 second.
