Interesting application.  This could be done in user space with
raw sockets, I think; perhaps something like
  raw_stamp in_if | raw_transmit out_if
where raw_stamp prepends a timestamp (from gettimeofday()) to each
relevant packet before writing to the pipe, and raw_transmit uses
a timer to schedule the outgoing packets based on the stamps.
If user space is unacceptable for some reason, I guess the network
driver could be hacked:  instead of immediately netif_rx(skb),
you'd want to append to a timer_list to defer the netif_rx() until
after some number of jiffies.
