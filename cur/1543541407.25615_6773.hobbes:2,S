Linus,
FYI.  The method NetWare uses is to keep a NestedInterrupt counter per
processor that gets incremented when an ISR is invoked and decremented
when the ISR completes.  This variable is exported and can be read by
all kernel modules.  If it's non-zero and someone attempts a context
switch, then it abends with the processes info.
Is there a counter of some type in Linux I could check to detect this
easily?
