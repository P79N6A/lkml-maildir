Yes, I get it now from this and Andi's mail. I hadn't thought about
that "special feature" of BKL :)

Hmm.. This understanding would make it easier for me to go take another look

BKL confused me here because I wasn't sure whether BKL was implicitly
protecting the tty driver code against anything else apart from itself.
