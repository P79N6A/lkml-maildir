Again, you seem to assume that resource limits and overcommit are
mutually exclusive. In fact, they are orthogonal; for most situations,
I would want BOTH. I want to be able to set limits on resource
consumption by users, and have demand-allocated VM.

How is demand-allocation of VM a "horrible" thing to do? Flexible,
demand-allocated memory is, IMO, vastly preferable to semi-static
worst-case allocation.
