[PATCH] Fix for leave-runtime-suspended-devices-off-at-system-resume.patch
A patch to fix my previous
leave-runtime-suspended-devices-off-at-system-resume patch; the new
changes save a copy of power.power_state in order to know whether to
resume a device, independently of mods to that field by a driver suspend
routine.  This fixes 2.6.7-rc1-mm1 in the same fashion as the updated
2.6.6 patch sent previously.
