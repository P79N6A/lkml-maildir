I agree totally with David, and this goes for SCSI too.  If it's not
reported on linux-scsi, there's a significant chance of us missing the
bug report.  The fact that some people notice bugs go past on LKML and
forward them to linux-scsi is a happy accident and not necessarily
something to rely on.
LKML has 10-20x the traffic of linux-scsi and a much smaller signal to
noise ratio.  Having a specialist list where all the experts in the
field hangs out actually enhances our ability to fix bugs.
