Just make a module out of the common code.  See sound/isa/sb/Makefile
for an example.  It would also help to make a common Kconfig symbol
that is not visible to the user but instead is selected by any one
of the twofish implementations.
If you do it this way then the assembly implementations just need to
select that Kconfig symbol to get the common code either built as a
module or compiled in.
Cheers,
