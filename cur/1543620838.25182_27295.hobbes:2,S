The PCI quirk fixup you posted (reproduced below) uses the test
"(pcic&6)!=6", so do you mean to say "if bit 1 or bit 2 is clear"?

Might this cause random hard lockups under a compute intensive load?
Since the fixup applies to the AMD762 northbridge, common to the 760MP
and 760MPX chipsets, this discussion applies to all SMP Athlon
motherboards at present, is that right?
Lastly, do you know whether the reason that the A7M266-D comes with a
PCI USB2 card is that the USB support of the AMD768 southbridge is
borked?  Both the Tyan S2466 and the MSI K7D Master come with PCI USB
cards.
Thanks,
Wayne
