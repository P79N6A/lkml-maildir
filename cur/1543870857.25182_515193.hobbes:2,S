In case anyone wants them, patches against v2.6.21-rc2-116-gbb648a0
for this are available from 
http://oss.oracle.com/~wli/stack_paranoia/
I only did arch/i386/ as per the Linux tradition, though I could
arrange for other arches easily enough, barring those for which I lack
target platforms. Testbooted on qemu -smp 4 with 64KB vmalloc()'d
stacks and IRQ stacks, compiletested in a couple of other configs.
Translation: very light testing. For me this was about reestablishing
reconnoiter of current mainline and familiarizing myself with qemu.
The patch series goes something like:
$ quilt series | xargs -i grep -nH '^Subj' patches/\{\} | cut -f2 -d/ |
cut -f 4 -d: | cat -n
     1   make stack size configurable
     2   add config option to vmalloc stacks
     3   make IRQ stacks independently configurable
     4   go BUG on vmallocspace in __pa()
     5   dynamically allocate IRQ stacks
     6   arrange for a guard page on cpu 0's IRQ stack
Chuck, is any of this of any use to you?
