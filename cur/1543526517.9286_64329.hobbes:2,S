No. Linux has bad habit to not flush data on disk when it's available.
If you'll try to copy 1MiB file on floppy then typically few KiBs will
be stored immideately, then for 10-15sec there will be no acess to
floppy and then (when deamon will try to flush beffers) rest will be saved.
It's perfectly possible (for novice user) to pull disk when only few KiBs
will be in fact saved. AFAIK change behaviour of VFS to store data to disk
as far as data is available AND guarantee that motor will be NEVER spin down
if there are exist dirty buffers will be also not trivial. And FAR less
reliable as well.
P.S. Do you REALLY think that anyone will use StarOffice for Linux instead of
MS Office for Windows if StarOffice for Linux will be SIGNIFICALLY less
reliable when used with floppies ? Windows works with floppies in "Amiga way"
(more or less) so it's MUCH more reliable when used with floppies then
supermount. So:
  1. Supermount DOES NOT look good in theoretical sence.
  2. Supermount DOES NOT look good even when compared to Windows.
Do we really need such beast in kernel ?
