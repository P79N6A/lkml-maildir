By killing and disabeling all remote logins when root logs in or by 
ptracing each user program during root sessions? You'd have to do this 
untill we find somebody to do the correct fix in the kernel.

You can allways chmod u+s `type -p keymap`, but you'll take the blame.

This is not enough, since it's a global setting. At least, it used to be 
when I last looked. loadkeys doesn't complain when run from an xterm, 
therefore I asume nobody changed this. I can't change to the console since 
ati sucks.

Unfortunartely nobody dares to implement this.

It's a bad day for presenting a usefull patch. It's one thing where
windows was ahead security-wise and which unices usurally lacked.
Off cause the CTRL-ALT-DEL secure screen is about to be disabled, so we 
can measure up to[0] windows by waiting.-)
