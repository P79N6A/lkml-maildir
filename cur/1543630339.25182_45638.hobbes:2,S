Basically, accept_source_route says how to handle packets with the SRR 
option set. If 1 (default for a router) it accepts those packets, if 0 
(default for a host) it will drop them. [This is actually written in 
../Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt]

They will be dropped on all interfaces since /all/accept_source_route=0.
Now you need to know that:
/all/${var}     means: enable this feature ${var}
/default/${var} means: inherit /all/${var} on newly instances of a
                        physical interface

all=0 should do the task.

ps.: I don't think this question belongs to lkml, next time you should
      maybe choose linux-net@vger.kernel.org.
