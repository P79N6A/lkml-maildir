Every time a new generation of ethernet comes out, its peak throughput exceeds 
the memory/CPU/IO capacity of commodity hardware available at the time.  This is 
normal.  Of course, you may not be saturating the link, and it may be possible 
to tune the driver to improve your throughput, but you'll still be saturating a 
CPU on that hardware.
