Consider:
Two threads share the file descriptor table.  
  1. Thread 1 performs close() on a file descriptor.  close fails.
  2. Thread 2 performs open().
* 3. Thread 1 performs close() again, just to make sure.
open() may return any file descriptor not currently in use.
Is step 3 necessary?  Is it dangerous?  The question is, is close
guaranteed to work, or isn't it?
Case 1: Close is guaranteed to close the file.
Thread 2 may have just re-used the file descriptor.  Thus, Thread 1
closes a different file in step 3.  Thread 2 is now using a bad file
descriptor, and becomes very angry because the kernel just said all was
right with the world, and then claims there was a mistake.  Thread 2
leaves in a huff.
Case 2: Close is guaranteed to leave the file open on error.
Thread 2 can't have just re-used the descriptor, so the world is ok in
that sense.  However, Thread 1 *must* perform step 3, or it leaks a
descriptor, the tables fill, and the world becomes a frozen wasteland.
Case 3: Close may or may not leave it open due to random chance or
filesystem peculiarities.
Thread 1 may be required to close it twice, or it may be required not to
close it twice.  It doesn't know!  Night is falling!  The world is in
flames!  Aaaaaaugh!
I believe this demonstrates the need for a standard, one way, or the
other.  :-)
