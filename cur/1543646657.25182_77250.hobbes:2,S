I am confused as to why Ingo would put these here.  He knows very well
what he is doing... surely he had a reason.
If he intended to force a preemption point here, then the lines needs to
be reversed.  This assumes, of course, preemption is disabled here.  But
I do not think it is.
If he just wanted to check for preemption, we have a
preempt_check_resched() which does just that (I even think he wrote
it).  Note as long as interrupts are enabled this probably does not
achieve much anyhow.
So I do not know.  I find it odd the solution is to completely remove
it...
Btw, I think the solution to the crash is to add a check to
cpu_online().
