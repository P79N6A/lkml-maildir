Yes.  Changing LPSTRICT's ioctl number looks to be the right thing to do.

There are all different ways of doing this.  The six common variations
are:
 busy-while-strobe    and   ack-in-busy
 busy-after-strobe          ack-after-busy
                            ack-while-busy
The 'correct' variation according to IEEE is 'busy-while-strobe and
ack-in-busy'.  The Centronics standard, on the other hand, is
'busy-after-strobe and ack-after-busy'.  It's a can of worms.
Plus, no implementation should really care about this sort of thing,
because it should be handshaking with ack rather than busy.  It's on my
to-do list, and the Linux implementation can potentially lose data with
very slow hardware.  ISTR some parallel port chipsets do the same thing
though.

This isn't wrong as such: the wait time is defined to be in processor
cycles.  The bug is that wait isn't volatile (is that still true in
2.0.37pre?), although I don't think it actually causes any problems yet.
