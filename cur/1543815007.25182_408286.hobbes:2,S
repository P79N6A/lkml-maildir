So...  The code's replacing the address_space's address_space_operations
with a copy which has .readpage() and .readpages() modified, because it
happens that filemap_nopage() uses those.
This is all rather hacky.
I think we need to step back and discuss what services this feature is
trying to provide, and how it is to provide them.  Your covering
description didn't describe that - it dives straigt into details without
even describing what the patches are trying to achieve.
So.  What are we trying to achieve here, and how are we trying to achieve
it?  What problems were encountered in the development of the feature and
how were they solved?  What alternative solutions were there?
I can mostly work all that out from background knowledge and looking at the
code, but I'd rather hear it from the designers please.
