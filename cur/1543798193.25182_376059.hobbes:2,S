The PCI-Board is to be applied in a large size copying machine, so it essentially has to transfer tons of data in 2 directions very fast without wasting cpu time (because the cpu has to run many image processing algorithms meanwhile on this data). So my approach is to allocate a quite large ringbuffer in kernel space (or more precisely one ringbuffer for each direction) which is capable of dma. Afterwards I would map this buffer to user space to avoid unnecessary memcopies/cpu usage. My problem is for now to get such a large DMA buffer. I tried out several things I read in O'Reilly's book, but they all failed so far. My current attempt is to take a high memory area with ioremap:

I have attached a "driver" that does nothing but map DMA-able pages
to user-space. It should show you what you need to do. It's really
quite simple, but the devil is in the details.
Also, if you are using the PLX or similar PCI interface device, you
can use the scatter-list capability so that the DMA pages don't
have to be contiguous. The mapping to user-space makes them
virtually contiguous to the user, but you can use pages from
anywhere in memory as long as its addressable by your controller.
