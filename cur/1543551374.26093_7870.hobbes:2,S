you are right, i was focused too much on the swapping case. I dont think
munmap() is a problem in the PAE case. pgd_clear() should stay a 64-bit
operation (like in Ben's patch) because we could get a legitimate TLB
flush between two 32-bit writes. (the 4 pgd entries are otherwise cached
in the CPU core, only TLB flushes reload them.)
