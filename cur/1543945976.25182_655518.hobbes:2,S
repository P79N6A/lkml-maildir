Hi Ingo,
I am running the sched-devel tree (at HEAD
44e770a8750abc7e876076cda718b413bad9e654) and it is not looking good.
I am running two "make -j"s for the kernel in two different cgroups and
interactivity is going for a toss. I can see noticable lags in
keypresses.
Will get down to debugging it further a bit later on.
