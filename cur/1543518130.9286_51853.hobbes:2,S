  Hi, all. Version 145 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.30. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.3.30-pre3
- Register whole-disc entry even for invalid partition tables
- Fixed bug in mounting root FS when initrd enabled
- Fixed device entry leak with IDE CD-ROMs
- Fixed compile problem with drivers/isdn/isdn_common.c
- Moved COSA devices to /dev/cosa
- Support fifos when unregistering
- Created <devfs_register_series> and used in many drivers
- Moved Coda devices to /dev/coda
- Moved parallel port IDE tapes to /dev/pt
- Moved parallel port IDE generic devices to /dev/pg
				Regards,
					Richard....
