The problem with the existing logic is that it is too coarse.  In trying 
to deal with one usage pattern it is negatively impacting performance for 
other reasonable access patterns.
Further, consider the extreme case of scanning a file 1 byte at a time. 
In this case, you are going to access a page over 4000 times, but that 
page is not going to be marked as active and hence that page is likely to 
be evicted from the cache.  Clearly, there are cases when scanning a file 
that you would like the pages to be kept in the cache.
Finally, the existing code is problematic as there is no reasonable way to 
circumvent the negative impact for small files.
Hence, I think a change is necessary.  The question is whether the 
intent of conditionally calling mark_page_accessed() is still reasonable 
and whether the amount of bookkeeping required to detect that usage 
pattern but not create a problem for other usage patterns is reasonable.
I would tend to agree with David that:  "Any application doing many 
tiny-sized reads isn't exactly asking for great performance."  As well, 
applications concerned with performance and caching problems can read in a 
file in PAGE_SIZE chunks.  I still think the simple fix of removing the 
condition is the best approach, but I'm certainly open to alternatives.
