Keeping the groups array as an array is a feature.  IMHO, if there are
too many for a kmalloc, vmalloc fallback makes sense: it's
conceptually simple and not that much code.
Introducing an almost-vmalloc because Linus didn't like the vmalloc
just doesn't make sense, IMHO.

Yep, you got them, I didn't.  I am still hoping Stephen (CC'd) will
move the IA64, S390 and Sparc64 code into kernel/compat.c which will
shrink out patches.

I screwed up a free.
Cheers,
