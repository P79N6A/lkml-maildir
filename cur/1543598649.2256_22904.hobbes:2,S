We fixed the installer for our upcoming release. But we cannot change
the CDs which were assembled and delivered some time ago. And yes, I
know how to use LD_PRELOAD...
BTW I appreciate the basics of the change for 2.4, but I don't agree
that we should break cases which worked before. (And the comment in
the sources is plain wrong that 2.2 failed in these cases)
