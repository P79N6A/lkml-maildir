Hmm, the only reason for this change is to unify with 64-bit, yes?  Yet it
doesn't actually win us anything on that front, as this diffstat shows.
If gcc's -mcmodel=kernel had used a weak symbol for the offset of the stack
canary, we would have been happy.  Unfortunately generic per-cpu and x86-64
PDA were developed separately, so noone realize the problem until too late.
The basic series looks good: it will clash with my per-cpu work (mainly
because I remove the per_cpu__ prefix) in a purely-textual way though.
Thanks for this!
Rusty.
