Given a suitable driver interface (not /dev/audio), AF can update
a sample so long as it hasn't been played yet.
Its strength is the ability to play through to the hardware,
allowing for very low latency playing of sound, which is what you
need for teleconferencing and games.
This is its real strength, along with simplicity and telephone support.
I'd redo the output buffers though, to provide separate buffers per
AC, if I were to hack on it again (and given current memory prices).
