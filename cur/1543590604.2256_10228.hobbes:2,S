Hi,
 is it normal that the size of /proc/kcore grows over time? Directly
after a boot it has the size of the physical memory. Over time it seems
to grow slightly. In about a day it went from 192 MB to about 203 MB.
This is 2.4.4-ac6 running on a Toshiba Notebook.
 I ask, because I thought the size of kproc could be used to determine
the amount of physical memory. If this assumption is wrong, is there
another way to achive the goal?
Happy weekend
Martin
