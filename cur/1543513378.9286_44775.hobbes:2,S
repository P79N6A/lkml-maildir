We do not account syscalls, neither do we redirect system calls. If anyone
is doing anything like that then all problems triggered by such a change
should be solved. Current kernels do not have this problem, and calling
system calls from within system calls is a _feature_.
some users of this feature: exec() is using fop->read(). sys_ustat() is
internally using ->statfs(). autofs is using ->write(). kNFSd is using
->read(), ->write(), ->readlink(), ->statfs(). NBD, loopback, etc.
this is a regular kernel feature, it gives us flexibility to reuse already
existing functionality internally.
there are even 'deeper' calls than calls to sys_*(), eg. khttpd is using
the socket layer quite directly, to do ->recvmsg(), ->sendmsg(), ->read()  
without any demultiplexing overhead and it's using internal socket-layer
data structures directly. [it uses other system calls as well, but only
those need set_fs()/get_fs() which are interacting with user-space VM]
