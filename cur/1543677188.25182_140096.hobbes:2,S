FYI:
It appears that somewhere between RH kernels 2.4.18-27.7.x and 2.4.20-18.9
something has changed so that my application needs a O_SYNC too besides
the O_DIRECT to make sure that writes will be synchronous.  If I leave
the O_SYNC out with 2.4.20-18.9 the write will happen physically 35
seconds after the write() was done.
Haven't tested with a vanilla 2.4.* kernel yet but will try.
(All modern 2.4.2? kernels I tried will hang for > 30s during boot while
probing the CompactFlash and are because of that kind of useless: my
application needs a 5s boot-time ..)
