Hi,
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
SCSI Disk freeze on NCR53c875
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
After issuing these included messages (s. [X.]) to a remote
logging host (the localhost couldn't write them anymore) the
kernel stops handling processes. 
Console switching and magic sysreq still work but seem not to be
able to Sync the affected partition.
It says sth. about "ext2fs: could not {read,write} inode for XXX" and
"ext2fs: could not read block map for XXX".
But I couldn't write them exactly down, because the repeat within
a second or two. klogd/syslogd doesn't see them unfortunatly (I
have an extra syslog host for this).
After a reboot (via magic sysreq) the BIOS says "Boot Failure",
because the SCSI adapter couldn't find the disk anymore.
After a reset, same as above.
After a powercycle (switch off, wait some seconds, switch on
again) everything works fine 'til next occourence of this
phenomeanon.
It happens around every 14 days. I have a moderate load with this
machine running apache and mysql.

[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
Please inform me, if this is a (disk-) hardware problem _for_ _sure_,
since I still own warranty time for this disk.
Many thanks
