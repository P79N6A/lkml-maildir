No, this is with CONFIG_MODULES=y.
Let me give another example where the kconfig implementation is 
completely broken (BTW: again with CONFIG_MODULES=y):
According to your language definition,
  m && !m
evaluates to "m" (it sounds a bit strange but follows directly from
rules (5) and (7) together with the interpretation of "m" as 1 as 
explained in the section "Menu dependencies" of
Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt).
Let's take the following Kconfig snippet:
config MOD
        tristate
        default m
config TEST8
        tristate
        default MOD && !MOD
config TEST9
        tristate
        default m && !m
With the explations above it's obvious both TEST8 and TEST9 should be 
"m", but the current 2.6 kconfig implementation says:
# CONFIG_TEST8 is not set
CONFIG_TEST9=y
That's not only different from the expected result directly derived from 
the language definition, it also gives two completely different results 
for the same expression!
