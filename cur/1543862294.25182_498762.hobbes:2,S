> Trying to understand, should I set CPUSETS=y
You don't need CPUSETS for this small a system.
But setting it is harmless - for example at least
one major commercial distribution enables CPUSETS
on almost all their product, most of which is running
on PC's less powerful than yours.
CPUSETS provides a facility for managing the memory
and processor placement of jobs running on what are
typically big NUMA systems.  Job X runs on CPUs 0-3
with memory on Nodes 0-1, while Job Y runs on CPUs
4-7 and Nodes 2-3.  And bigger ... to hundreds and
thousands of CPUs and Nodes.
