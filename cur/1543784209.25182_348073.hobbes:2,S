In swsusp, the suspend consists of freezing processes, suspending devices, turning off
interrupts, and creating a memory snapshot (the image) in that state (ie of the "frozen"
system).  Afterwards the image is in memory and it has to be written to a swap partition.
For this purpose we need to resume some devices, in particular the disk that contains
this swap partition, but it always relies on some other devices that have to be resumed
as well.  In principle we could check what devices have to be resumed, but currently
we just resume them all.  An additional upside of this approach is that the suspend
and resume code is (almost) identical.
Greetings,
