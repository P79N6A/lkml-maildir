True, but our plan is to develop a module to wrap PCI comunication,
bypassing northbridge driver and PCI IP-core:
Application <-> our driver <-> kernel PCI-subsystem <-> our link <->
daemon <-> SystemC simulator.
Our link and our daemon get all PCI communication, and interface to
SystemC simulator.
Is that so complex to develop?
Also, we want to validate functional behavior, not timming. But we need
to validate entire funcionality, so we think an emulator won't be
accurate enough.

We are using Cynthesizer by ForteDS with a educational license. This
tool generates Verilog from SystemC. we are in troubles mapping this
verilog to FPGAs, due to libraries problems (a fix for that is using
ASIC libraries and then remap them to FPGA), but they said us new
version (3Q2005) will support FPGAs.
