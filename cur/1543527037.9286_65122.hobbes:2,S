fwiw here int80 syscall overhead is ~298 cycles (that's getpid latency),
sysenter reduces it by ~130 cycles.

it isn't. at least not for uncommon ones like accept/close; if the
few hundred cycles make a real difference you have other problems
anyway. [ignoring benchmark #s]

not that i know of. it's not trivial stuff; you'll probably end up
redesigning a large part of the current syscall code (if it's to be
reasonably clean). i actually now have both sysenter and the magic 
sysentry page in this kernel, but i haven't merged them together
yet :) (various reasons, like: it's not 2.4 stuff, i was kind of hoping
the people who were mentioning amd syscall would produce something too
(so i could be sure the abi worked for them too), there are a few unsolved
issues etc.).
