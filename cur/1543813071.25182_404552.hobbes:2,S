If you have 
CPU #0
	spin_lock(&foo->lock)
	writel(0, &foo->regnum)
	writel(1, &foo->data);
	spin_unlock(&foo->lock);
					CPU #1
						spin_lock(&foo->lock);
						writel(4, &foo->regnum);
						writel(5, &foo->data);
						spin_unlock(&foo->lock);
then on some NUMA infrastructures the order may not be as you expect. The
CPU will execute writel 0, writel 1 and the second CPU later will execute
writel 4 writel 5, but the order they hit the PCI bridge may not be the
same order. Usually such things don't matter but in a register windowed
case getting 0/4/1/5 might be rather unfortunate.
See Documentation/DocBook/deviceiobook.tmpl (or its output)
The following case is safe
	spin_lock(&foo->lock);
	writel(0, &foo->regnum);
	reg = readl(&foo->data);
	spin_unlock(&foo->lock);
as the real must complete and it forces the write to complete. The pure write
case used above should be implemented as
	spin_lock(&foo->lock);
	writel(0, &foo->regnum);
	writel(1, &foo->data);
	mmiowb();
	spin_unlock(&foo->lock);
The mmiowb ensures that the writels will occur before the writel from another
CPU then taking the lock and issuing a writel.
Welcome to the wonderful world of NUMA
