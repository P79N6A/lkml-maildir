Very bad idea. People using unusual hardware do not want to keep 
re-submitting a bug report. I know when I submit a report I expect that
it will remain until the problem is fixed. I do not like to receive
multiple copies of a bug report so I don't submit multiple copies unless
it's going to be helpful (like pointing out different versions that 
exhibit the problem). If I thought my report was just going to get 
dropped because the developer was busy that month I wouldn't bother to
submit at all. I'd rather wait 6 months for a fix knowing that the 
report is still in the database than just have it dropped.
