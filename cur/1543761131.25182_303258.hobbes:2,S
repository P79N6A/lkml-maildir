use a Cisco MDS FC switch and all your problems will go away. :-)
just kidding ... the errors you're seeing will likely happen regardless of 
what brand FC switch you have .. LUN Discovery and/or FC NS queries are 
likely the same regardless of FC switch.
what you're seeing is essentially a bug in the qlogic driver - and likely 
why it was listed as being "beta".
if you're after multipathing support, rather than doing it in the FC 
driver, may i suggest that you instead look at using Christophe Varoqui's 
excellent multipath-tools (see 
http://christophe.varoqui.free.fr/wiki/wakka.php?wiki=Home
) which i have 
used successfully here across a range of midrange & enterprise storage arrays
cheers,
