Oops.  I probably should have used the ID in the debug messages...  I 
guess it doesn't matter now.

Not for me.  We ship hundreds of systems each month with a motherboard 
with that chip on it.  I think it's actually on two different 
motherboards we sell.

Wouldn't a force_xxx parameter cause a specific bus/id to be probed and 
assigned first?

Well, that's exactly the problem that I had.  The motherboard vendor's 
BIOS didn't set the chip up and I had to program it myself.  I got the 
schematics from the vendor for the part of the motherboard attached to 
the chip so that I could program it correctly.

I think that would be a bad idea.  Reprogramming any chip is generally a 
bad idea (as we can see from the recent removal of all the init code) 
and forcing any specified config to apply to all chips found in the 
system would be an even worse idea.
I think a better idea that addresses your concerns about bus ordering 
would be to add an additional parameter that is a bus/chip number pair 
which is the chip to initialize.  Something like:
static int gpio_target[2] = { -1, -1 }
MODULE_PARM(gpio_target, "2i");
MODULE_PARM_DESC(gpio_target,"Address of chip to whose GPIO is to be 
programmed");
This would be similar to the bus/address pairs used in the 
force_subclient parameters to the w83781d driver.

Not anymore, but I did as I mention above.
:v)
