Are they ? read barriers and full barriers are, write barriers should be
fairly cheap (but then, I haven't measured).

The main problem I've had in the past with the ppc barriers is more a
subtle thing in the spec that unfortunately was taken to the word by
implementors, and is that the simple write barrier (eieio) will only
order within the same storage space, that is will not order between
cacheable and non-cacheable storage. That means IOs could leak out of
locks etc... Which is why we use expensive barriers in MMIO wrappers for
now (though we might investigate the use of mmioXb instead in the
future).

Actually, the ppc's full barrier (sync) will generate bus traffic, and I
think in some case eieio barriers can propagate to the chipset to
enforce ordering there too depending on some voodoo settings and wether
the storage space is cacheable or not.
