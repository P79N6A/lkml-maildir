Hi Adrian, all,
Just a 'me too' I'm afraid.  I have a HP7100i, ATAPI, using ide-scsi,
cdrecord 1.8 / 1.8.1 or 1.9 returns unsupported request for me too.
Currently running 2.2.17pre16 with rather a lot of additional patches
including new i2c / resier / lmsensors / crypto / usb backport / alsa.
My system is also smp.
I've been holding off a report until I made time to backtrace to the
last kernel that worked, but as Adrian posted, I thought I'd chip in
too.
Checking my logs, I saw an 'unsupported command in request queue(0)'
back on July 5th... which was 2.2.17pre7.  That one will have had
i2c/lm/alsa patched in at least.
Best regards,
Mark
