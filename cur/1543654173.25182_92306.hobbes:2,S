hi Ingo, hi all,
some time ago, you posted a patch for a HT aware scheduling:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0208.3/0449.html
does this run in 2.4 kernels? I am doing testing with P4 machines currently, and would like to get some numbers concerning ht out of this testing. However, this does not seem to make too much sense with a "normal" SMP scheduler.
regards,
Florenz
