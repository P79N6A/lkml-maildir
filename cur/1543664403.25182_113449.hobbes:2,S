Hi,
I tried to report a bug in kernel 2.2.23 to Alan.Cox@linux.org, as instructed
by the 2.2.23 documents, but got a bounce message:                       
                       The Postfix program
<Alan.Cox@linux.org>: Name service error for domain linux.org: Host found but
    no data record of requested type
Here is the bug report:
