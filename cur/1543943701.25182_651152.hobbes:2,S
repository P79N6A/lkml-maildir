It would be nice if you could move the kerneldoc comments to the proper
place at least.  And while you're at it please remove all the filenames
in the top-of-file comments, not just in include/asm-generic/kgdb.h.
While we're at it is there a good reason to have that file at all, it's
just function prototypes, and I'd say for now they should just go
into linux/kgdb.h.  If there's a a good reason why architectures
should implement them as inlines we can move them back, but looking
at the x86 implementation I doubt that's the case.
Also it seems at least some of Jan's patches are missing aswell.
I think we really shouldn't rush this too much.  Let's wait until
Monday at least when Jason and Jan are back.
