Well yes.  waitid() has been in there since 2.6.9.  I assume that it
has had this wait4-emulation mode for that amount of time as well?

Well, we might get away with it.  But formally speaking, we should live
with our Linux-specific screwup.
If we _are_ going to make this change then we should merge it as far
back in -stable as we can, to reduce the risk that people will develop
applications on kernel version A only to have then behave differently
on version B.
