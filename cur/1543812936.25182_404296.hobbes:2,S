Yeah, the problem looks kind of related. But I doubt it is the CPU
scheduler only that plays tricks on us, because in the my 64MB case
things seem to work ok at all times. But maybe it's just random.
I've spent this morning testing 2.6.15, and that version seems to work
ok. And just to double check I rebuilt and retested 2.6.16-rc5. This
round gives me the similar results - now it fails to go above 101% CPU
load in one case.
