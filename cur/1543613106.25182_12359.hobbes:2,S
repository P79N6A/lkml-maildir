I hope that in the excitement of re-re-inventing the build process no one
has lost sight of the Configure.help file being very useful with the
database tools `more' and `grep.' Having to run a configure to get access
to that info is a step backwards.
It would be nice if the information gave a link between options and module
names as well, poking through Makefiles and source code to see how it's
done is educational, but a real waste of time.
