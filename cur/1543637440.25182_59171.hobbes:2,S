Why? What is wrong with large devices/file systems? Why do we have to break 
up everything into multiple devices? Just because the kernel is "too lazy" 
to implement support for large devices? Nobody cares if 64bit code is 
10-20% slower than 32bit code on a storage server. The storage devices are 
physically way slower than the system, so the data throughput would not be 
affected in the slightest. We would just see a higher CPU load on the 
database server and we can live with that. At least our applications deal 
with GiBs of data for each experiment, which is shifted over Gigabit 
ethernet to/from a SQL database backend stored on a huge RAID array, so we 
are completely i/o bound.
It's one database, and it's huge. And it's going to get bigger as people do 
more experiments. We need mkfs.<whatever> on a huge device... We are just 
lucky that our current RAID array is under 2TiB se we haven't hit the 
"magic" barrier quite yet. But at 1.4TiB we are not far off...
Best regards,
         Anton
