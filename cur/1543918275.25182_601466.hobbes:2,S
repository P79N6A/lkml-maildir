OK look, I don't want to hold up progress. I do like to ask these questions
and be difficult if I think there might be a better way and/or to make sure
you've thought about all the angles. I'm not volunteering to maintain
cpusets and I'm not as close to the customers who care as you.
Obviously what your patches do here is a lot closer to "the right thing"
than cpus_exclusive. And the worst problem they'll cause is to add
cruft to cpusets.c.
So I'll keep persuing the other subthread for the same reasons, but aside
from implementation nits, I don't know if it is worth holding up a merge.
