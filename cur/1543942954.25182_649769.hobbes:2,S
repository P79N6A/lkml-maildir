So you don't think it's related to the interrupt coalescing by any chance ?
I'd suggest to try and disable the coalescing and see if it makes any difference.
We've had lots of issues with coalescing misbehavior. Not this bad (ie 1 second) though.
Add this to modprobe.conf and reload e1000 module
options e1000 RxIntDelay=0,0 RxAbsIntDelay=0,0 InterruptThrottleRate=0,0 TxIntDelay=0,0 TxAbsIntDelay=0,0
