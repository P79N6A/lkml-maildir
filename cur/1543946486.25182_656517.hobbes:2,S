Hm, I get the following build error with this patch:
	  CC      drivers/pci/pcie/aspm.o
	distcc[13135] ERROR: compile /home/gregkh/.ccache/aspm.tmp.mini.13131.i on localhost failed
	In file included from drivers/pci/pcie/aspm.c:21:
	include/linux/pci-acpi.h:66: error: expected ')' before 'handle'
	make[2]: *** [drivers/pci/pcie/aspm.o] Error 1
	make[1]: *** [drivers/pci/pcie] Error 2
	make: *** [_module_drivers/pci] Error 2
Also, can you rename your new header file to have "pci-" in front of it?
thanks,
