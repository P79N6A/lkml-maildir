Right, enabling HT hasn't relied on "acpismp=force" since 2.4.18.
Requiring "acpismp=force" now in 2.4 or 2.5 is just a step backwards.
But when we changed to HT by default, I added bootparam "noht" to
disable it if it was found troublesome.  Last time I checked, "noht"
was ineffectual on 2.5, and perhaps now it's ineffectual on 2.4.22-pre?
(If I remember right, in 2.5 it did have one effect, determining whether
the "ht" flag is shown in /proc/cpuinfo: but it was intended to be more
useful than that.)
Certainly reliance on "acpismp=force" should be removed if it's crept
back in.  But what should we do about "noht"?  Wave a fond goodbye,
and remove it's associated code and Documentation from 2.4 and 2.5
trees, rely on changing the BIOS setting instead?  Or bring it back
into action?
