Hmm... if ((1 == A) && (A > 0)) {
Unless i2QueueCommands has a side-effect on being re-evaluated (which isn't
guaranteed to happen), it looks like this can be simplified a bit,
since the '&& (A > 0)' is superfluous.
I think the code started as 'if A == 1' and became 'if A > 0', or vice
versa, and somebody needs to check what's *REALLY* intended...
