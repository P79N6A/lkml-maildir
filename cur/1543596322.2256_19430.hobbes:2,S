Subject: [PATCH] Hotplug PCI driver for 2.4.6 and 2.4.5-ac24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I've made a patch for the Compaq/Intel Hotplug PCI driver against both
2.4.6 and 2.4.5-ac24 available at:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/
Here is a list of the things that have been changed since the last patch
I sent out:
	- forward ported to 2.4.6
	- added Configure.help entries
	- fixed the directory structure to be a bit more sane
	- renamed the files to make more sense
	- fixed spinlock bugs
	- split the Compaq NVRAM portion of the driver to be a compile
	  time option for those without Compaq servers (will make i64
	  port a bit easier.)
	- cleaned up the symbol namespace.  Now plays well with the rest
	  of the kernel.
	- fixed a number of bugs when the driver attempts to be loaded
	  on a system that does not actually have the Compaq Hotplug PCI
	  device (no more oopses!)
	- got rid of almost all non-Linux specific code.  There is one
	  pci function that needs to be still cleaned up, but it is very
	  minor.
	- added MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE support (yes the Hotplug PCI driver
	  is now /sbin/hotplug compatible :)
	- lots of dead code removal.
	- cleaned up the function comment style.
	- loads of other little changes.
I've tested this patch on both Compaq and Intel hotplug controllers.
There are only a few minor things left to do:
	- incorporate native list types where possible.
	- add support for other archs (ia64)
	- get driver into the kernel tree.
If anyone has any problems or questions about this version, please let
me know.
thanks,
greg k-h
