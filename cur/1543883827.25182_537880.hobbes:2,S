Now you are beginning to sound like a bootloader author.
Make it work and forget about it :)

I'm trying to recall how we handle this on the LinuxBIOS side.
Because we have machines without a framebuffer setup.  Oh yeah,
we started in 32bit mode...
I do have some parameters to parse the command line in misc.c that
would accomplish this goal.

I'm tempted to just reload the segments in setup.S, but that might
break loadlin support or one of the other bootloaders that starts the
kernel in 32bit mode so we need to be careful.

Straight isn't the way I would but it but yes. startup_32 in arch/i386/head.S
is the first piece of code that outside of the decompressor that it runs.

P==V mappings I suspect.

Exactly.

Yes.

Yes.  That is why we need a distinct field for this and not overloading
the bootloader id.  That way if the field is non-zero we need to do
something special.

It's the only way that will be sane.  When I was doing my ELF header on
bzImage work I had that working.  But it got dropped due to some unexplained,
unreproducible testing failures and not really being necessary at the
time.  We also need that if we want to be certain we don't play with
page tables.
The other thing the ELF headers gave was a precise accounting of where
the kernel was, which is essentially what needs to be mapped at boot
time.
The hard part I suspect is going to be handling Xen when setup the
physical == virtual page tables

I think we all will but the upside if we design this carefully is
something that we won't have to change.
