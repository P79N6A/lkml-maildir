It isn't a bug.  It's a normal
let-the-stupid-user-shoot-themselves-in-the-foot situation.  Let's
explicitly document the fact that you can't pass both flags, then maybe
add a WARN_ON() or another printk.  Or, we just fail the allocation.  
Failing the allocation seems like the simplest and most effective
solution.  A developer will run into it when they're developing, it
won't be killing off processes or locking things up like a BUG(), and it
doesn't ruin any of the fragmentation strategy.  It also fits with the
current behavior if someone asks the allocator do do something silly
like give them memory from a non-present zone.
