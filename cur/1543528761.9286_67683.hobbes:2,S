Because that's all you really need for IO within a segment? Notice that
pointer to data is also updated.

It's not about merging (and predates it, BTW). Just that if request covers
several sectors (block size > 512, absolutely common situation) you _have_
to keep track of the sector number and memory address. And it's either
global variables <bletch>, or allocating structures and storing this thing
there (allocating... deep in the IO path? could you spell "deadlocks"?)
_or_ using the request fields.

Right, but odds went up when plugging was allowed. That's when it became
really visible - no races were required to trigger the thing.

	Yeah, and we both know how Linus reacts to such ideas. Frankly, I
understand him very well on that - it's _the_ way to nightmarish code.

OK, so where do you keep the current sector number during the IO for
multi-sector bh? Now merging, just a block larger than sector.
end_request() is not going to help you - it's not going to be called after
each sector. Come on, look for this stuff in drivers/block/hd.c.
