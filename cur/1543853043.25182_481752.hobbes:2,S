Hotmail is probably the _worse_ email client you could use to send 
patches to the kernel.

The logical separation you did isn't bad, but there is no mention on the 
*subject line* what section is targeted by your patch.
Also you should CC the maintainer for each section you're targeting. For 
instance, for the ACPI patch you should also CC Len Brown. Check the 
MAINTAINERS file for the right people to CC on each patch.

Afraid so.
While you're at it, you could remove casts like this one:
-	pathname = (char *)kmalloc(ACPI_PATHNAME_MAX, GFP_KERNEL);
+	pathname = (char *)kzalloc(ACPI_PATHNAME_MAX, GFP_KERNEL);
  	if (!pathname)
  		return -ENOMEM;
-	memset(pathname, 0, ACPI_PATHNAME_MAX);
That "(char *)" really isn't needed.
Oh, and just one more thing: don't top post.
