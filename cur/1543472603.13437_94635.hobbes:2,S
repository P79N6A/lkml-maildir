Ok.. I've implemented most of this, ie. i now have the file
/proc/sys/kernel/corename that you can write to in the above fashion.
Not all the expanding %<whatever> codes are implemented yet, but i'll
get around to that soon.
/proc/sys/kernel/corename defaults to core so that this "feature" won't
bother anyone that doesn't want it.
The %<whatever> codes can be inserted anywhere in the string for maximum
flexability.
This is in fact the first time i've made any real change to the kernel
code, but i think (hope) i've done everything right.
If anyone is interested in this feature (maybe it could even go into the
official kernel?) i'll post a patch.
Thanks for your time..
