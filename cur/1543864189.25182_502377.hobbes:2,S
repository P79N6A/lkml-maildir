It doesn't have to be 100% accurate.  The pages that are mapped
both mlocked and non-mlocked will probably be only shared
libraries.

As long as we get it right for the large objects, it should be
fine.

Just because it's not common does not mean you can just ignore
it and hope Linux doesn't unexpectedly fall over.
One thing that knowing the amount of mlocked data in each zone
(and node) would allow us to do is spread the mlocked memory
around a little better at allocation time.  This could prevent
some of the "I started a 6GB Oracle on my 8GB system and it
immediately fell over" bugs.
