Turns out I got bitten by too old binutils. Could you do a "feet/metre" convertion in
Documentation/Changes under _Current Minimal Requirements_, something like:
o  binutils               2.9.5.0.25              # ld -v
+or
+o GNU/binutils           2.13.(wherever 'as' got to know about incbin)
I had the GNU 2.11.2 which is higher than 2.9.x... right ;-)
