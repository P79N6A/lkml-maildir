Hi at all,
as first i want to thank you for your precious job.
I'm sorry for my bad english and i hope don't make you lose your time. I'm 
sending you this mail not to have an anwser as i don't need the newer kernel 
(i work with the previous anyway), but only hopping to give you  some 
"advise" on the possible bugs of the newer kernel.
So i'm passing to explain my problems.
I'm using a Slackware 9.1 with gcc 3.2.3 on a MITAC's laptop.
I tried to compile the newer kernel 2.6.8.1 in this way:
I copied the ".config" file from kernel2.6.7 to the newer 2.6.8.1, and then i 
controlled if alway was right with "make menuconfig".
At the end i compiled the kernel and i saw that my mouse and vfat "dosn't 
work" (a bad sentense...i know).
I controlled then the difference between the ".config" files of the two kernel 
versions but they are nearly equal.
To be more precise the following are my .config files and my dmesg messagges 
(only the part i thought would interesting)
First: Mouse: i have a Logitech optical usb mouse. 
the following are the .config file of kernel 2.6.7 followed from the dmesg:
[...]

CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
# CONFIG_KEYBOARD_SUNKBD is not set

And this is the .config file of kernel 2.6.8.1 followed from the dmesg: 
[...]

Second: i cannot mount my vfat partition.
This is my dmesg log:
[...]
Unable to load NLS charset cp437
FAT: codepage cp437 not found
[...]
this is the error message when i try to mount the partition with my hands:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda7,
       or too many mounted file systems
the command that i used was: mount -t vfat /dev/hda7 /win
but in this case the config file is a bit different.
kernel 2.6.7:
#
# DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems
#
CONFIG_FAT_FS=y
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=y
CONFIG_VFAT_FS=y
CONFIG_NTFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_NTFS_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_NTFS_RW=y
kernel 2.6.8.1:
#
# DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems
#
CONFIG_FAT_FS=y
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=y
CONFIG_VFAT_FS=y
CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE=437
CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET="iso8859-1"
CONFIG_NTFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_NTFS_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_NTFS_RW=y
and the different fields cannot be canged manually....(i mean with menuconfig)
And finally a good news!
With the newer kernel i can use my sis video card...even if theese are my last 
messages of dmesg:
sisfb: Deprecated ioctl call received - update your application!
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program, like XFree86, might be 
trying access hardware directly.
the following are the lspci -v messages for the video card:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 
SiS650/651/M650/740 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Subsystem: Mitac: Unknown device 8575

        BIST result: 00

        Memory at e0000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128K]

        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 1
        Capabilities: [50] AGP version 2.0
this is my dmessages for kernel 2.6.7 (where my sis video card was not 
detected. With this kernel i'm using the generic VESA card instead of sis 
card, because with the sis video card, when i boot the machine i cannot see 
anything. I put this messages too because probably can help you.)

I hope to do not post at the wrong address or wrote wrong things. 
I post this mail because i'm suspicious because the nearly equal .config file 
has produced a kernel so..."unstable".
I want to remember you that your work is really important for more 
people...both just students like me, or theachers, firms....and so on.
Thanks for all.
Alberto
