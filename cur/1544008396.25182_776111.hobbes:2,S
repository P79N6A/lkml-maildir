I think the above is the core issue - you have something privileged to
be executed.   So why not execute it in a small, code-verifiable
implementation, just like the Privilege Separation idea of SSH?
http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/privsep.pdf
Everything is done in userspace.   SInce the privileged component is
small, it is easy to verify for correctness.   The rest execute with
lesser privilege.
Recently, the hypervisor has been used to implement this verifiable
source code concept:   see:
http://www.ghs.com/news/20081117_integrity_EAL6plus_security.html
where GreenHill achieved EAL6 certification - as it built its entire
kernel on top of the hypervisor.   (called Separation Kernel,
conceptually similar to that of Privilege Separation in SSH).
Just my 2cts :-).
