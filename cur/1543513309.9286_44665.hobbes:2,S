Ouch.  Ingo, what's the best way to deal with this?  We really ought
to be able to set any blocksize on any device without that sort of
performance penalty, but it looks as if the raid0 device just isn't up
to handling that.  
There are applications which attempt to write in 512-byte units to a
raw device.  Setting the default blocksize to anything larger isn't
really an option.
