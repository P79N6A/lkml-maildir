    Ah, indeed! Nice. :-)

    Oops, "not that" didn't make sense here :-)

    Well, most of the recent fixes were for such issues.  Nobody had screamed 
about them, it took a code review to find them. :-)

    Thanks. :-)

    Ugh, this one is more tough than pdc202xx_old.c -- since tuneproc() is 
also borken (doesn't set drive's own transfer mode).
    And... I looked into speedproc() handler, then into PCI0646U datasheet for 
reference and was really terrified: the code for SW/DW DMA setup us utter 
nonsense!  It writes to some reserved bits of BMIDE status reg. instead of 
doinf the real setup, and twiddles the drive 0/1 DMA capable bit which nobody 
asks it to do... Really messy mess. :-(
