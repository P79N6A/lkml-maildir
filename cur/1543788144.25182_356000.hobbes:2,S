These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
THIS INCLUDES ALL THE PATCHES IN 2.6.13.3 SO YOU SHOULD START WITH 2.6.13 TO 
USE THESE PATCHES

Added:
 +sp11_sp14.patch
Swap prefetch version 14. Substantial improvements were done to the swap 
prefetching code. Numerous locking improvements, better testing of when to 
prefetch, and most importantly the pinned swapcache bug which would 
eventually lead to slowdowns and even out-of-memory kills was found and 
fixed. 
It is now tunable with the parameter in 
/proc/sys/vm/swap_prefetch
to determine how many blocks of 128kb it will prefetch at a time. The default 
is set to 2, setting it to 0 disables prefetching, and you can set a high 
value (such as 1000) to basically prefetch everything it can in one go while 
the vm is idle.
This code is considered safe and I believe stable now.
