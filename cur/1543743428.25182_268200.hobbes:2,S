Read the source:
-----------------
 * NOTE: The meye device expects dma_addr_t size to be 32 bits
 * (the toc must be exactly 1024 entries each of them being 4 bytes
 * in size, the whole result being 4096 bytes). We're using here
 * dma_addr_t for corectness but the compilation of this driver is
 * disabled for HIGHMEM64G=y, where sizeof(dma_addr_t) != 4 !
-----------------
Of course, the actual hardware does exist only on C1V* Vaio Laptops,
which can accept at most 256 MB RAM, so the test is there in Kconfig
only to prevent 'make allyesconfig' and equivalents from spitting
warnings...
