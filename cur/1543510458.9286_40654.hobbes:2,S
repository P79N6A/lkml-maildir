I tried out 2.3.18ac8 yesterday on a couple of machines.  These are my
experiences:
On the first (a Toshiba laptop) all ran OK, but as there is no supported
PCMCIA it was
a bit of a 'mare to get online (pcmcia-cs wouldn't compile, but I
managed to use the
kernel PCMCIA and compile just the cardmgr app to get it all working).
On the second machine (a dual PIII-450 on a Tyan motherboard) I had
problems with the IDE if
I enabled PIIX4 support (it detected it, then stopped with 'couldn't
mount root FS').  Dropping
back to generic IDE solved that one.
More seriously the 3 3c905b cards in that machine all failed to work
(all work flawlessly with 2.2.13) -
they appeared to be receiving packets (iptables was reporting incoming
packets), but not transmitting them.
I also got a steady stream of eth0 timeout errors.
I guess I'll wait a bit before trying again.  I could really have done
with the iptables though...
