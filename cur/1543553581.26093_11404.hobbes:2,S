Hi,
Compiling linux kernel using gcc-2.95.2 I've received some errors in emd.c
file. That was in 145 line and similar bug in 264 line.
gcc has problems with binary - :
int part = (page_address(page) + PAGE_CACHE_SIZE) - p->spare;
I think that there must be explicit casting to int, like this:
int part = (int)(page_address(page) + PAGE_CACHE_SIZE) - (int)p->spare;
and there won't be errors in compile time.
BFN
