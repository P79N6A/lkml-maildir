I would add to that than rather than killing the taskfile stuff, it
should instead be generalized and any IDE access be done via a taskfile.
I don't comment on the actual implementation quality as I didn't look
into it closely, but the point of passing requests as taskfile's
down to the lowest level driver allow more consistency between the
various pieces of the driver, more easily hooking of the low level
taskfile "apply" code to accomodate MMIO or strangely mapped IDE
controllers, etc...
Alan: BTW, Apple's Darwin has a nice ATA layer implementation that
happens to be completely taskfile based :) Ask Andre what he thinks
about their ATA & SCSI layer, except from bloat due to their C++
implementation, their overall design is actually really nice !
