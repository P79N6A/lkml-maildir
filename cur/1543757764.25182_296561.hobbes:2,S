I think I already had a pretty good grasp on that, in my previous post 
on this I noted: "The last time I looked at this, the issue was that the 
user software did a large read and the ide-cd didn't properly return a 
small data block with no error, but rather returned an error with no 
data. If you get the size of the ISO image, you can read that with any 
program which doesn't try to read MORE than that."
It sounds as if (a) the problem with ide-cd is going to get fixed, and 
(b) ide-scsi may not remain depreciated. A win-win if I ever saw one.
