I go through the thread again and I guess you changed the wrong place. 
in line 114:
				if (!pr || request_resource(pr, r) < 0)
					printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Cannot
allocate resource region %d of bridge %s\n", idx, pci_name(dev));
In line 145:
		if (!pr || insert_resource(pr, r) < 0) {
					printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Cannot
allocate resource region %d of device %s\n", idx, pci_name(dev));
Please don't touch line 114, and change 'insert_resource' to '
request_resource' in line 145. Sorry for my bad mail client.
Thanks,
Shaohua
