I need some kernel help and don't know where else to turn.  I've been to
the
newsgroups and through google, basic kernel info pages, etc. to death.  
Need to ask for direct reply as for whatever reason my sendmail rejects
the kernel digest "data format error" and I get knocked off the list.
Two things, the first one very easy: is there any documentation around
(beyond slab.c) that could be used to interpret /proc/slabinfo?  So far
my search has come up dry. . 
I also need to see where to find info on interpreting the following type
of message.  I am getting these (this much, by the way--exactly 5 lines
of message--and no more; no OOPs or anything) eight or ten times a day. 
About once a day this system hangs and has to be rebooted, ALWAYS right
after one of these messages.
If there is a place more appropriate to post this sort of thing, that
pointer would also be gratefully accepted.  
Thanks in advance and sorry for the noise.
