Turns out it's not that hard. Sorry for the slight delay, I've been away 
a few days.

If you want to seem the actual oom messages just ask.
This is with 2.6.10-rc2-mm1 + your patch whilst doing an "emerge sync" 
which isn't ridiculously memory hungry and shouldn't result in oom kills.
Informally I felt I had better results from Marcelo's patch, though I 
should test both under the same conditions before I say that...

Chris R.
