Just means that some RPC message reply from the server was crap. We should 
deal fine with that sort of thing...
AFAICS The Oops itself happened deep down in the socket layer in the part 
which has to do with reassembling fragments into packets. The garbage 
collector tried to release a fragment that had timed out and Oopsed.
Suggests either memory corruption or else that the networking driver is doing 
something odd ('cos at that point in the socket layer *only* the driver + the 
fragment handler should have touched the skb).
