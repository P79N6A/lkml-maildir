People are quite used to reading diffs, so it's not that much of a bother.

Uncompressed attachments, or inline inclusions, are usually preferred as
it allows you to read the stuff in your mail application.
I have one reservation with your driver though. The Linux kernel already
has a generic SD/MMC layer. So if your hardware is a bus interface, then
it should use that layer. There is even a driver there for your
W83L518/9 devices. :)
For the other buses, a generic layer would be preferable, but as you
would be the only user, that isn't required quite yet. I would suggest
contacting Andrew Morton as he is the overall 2.6 maintainer.

PS. I have a question regarding the W83L518 hardware, but haven't been
able to get in touch with the right people. Perhaps you have some pointers?
