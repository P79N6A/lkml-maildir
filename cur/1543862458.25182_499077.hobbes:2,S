You're welcome.  :-)

Yeah, probably.  Care to submit patch to FAQ to Jeff?

That's because something is still holding onto /dev/sdd.  The device
remains dangled until all references to it are gone.  /dev/sdd is still
lingering when the drive is hotplugged; thus, it gets assigned the next
device.
I think this is best solved by udev.  Think of /dev/sdX as kernel
internal name which may change from time to time.  Mount devices with
LABEL's and use udev-provided persistent names to access removable
devices.  Also, libata can be improved to tell udev that certain ports
are external, I think.
Thanks.
