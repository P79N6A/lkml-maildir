Because
- this (human) error occurs even in the absence of any old config
  which might be able to be made (i.e. I do not use patch for new
  kernel releases), and
- the nature of the error messages given bears positively zero
  relation to the actual flaw encountered; one has to go grep'ing the
  source to find out what was wrong, when the source itself could
  indicate immediately what went wrong, just by use of #error.
I have seen 3 reports of this in l-k since CONFIG_xGB came into
existence, and we can only wonder how many identical cases go
unreported by others who have grep'd and found their trouble the hard
way.  Manifestly, it is a common problem.  The trivial extra 2 lines
would eliminate such reports entirely.  There is no reason *not* to do
it -- there is no reason to manifest "the hard way" in the 1st place.
