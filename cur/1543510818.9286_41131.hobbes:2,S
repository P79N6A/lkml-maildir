You've looked it over a few times, perhaps you've even placed it in your bookmarks, but when was the last time you clicked on

THE BOLD NEW LOOK OF GRIST MAGAZINE,
EARTH DAY NETWORK'S ONLINE UPSTART
Grist Magazine, Earth Day Network's acclaimed online magazine, also has a brand new look at 
http://www.gristmagazine.com
.  Grist features everything from spunky original reporting, "green" stock tips and stunning photo essays to wry cartoons, lifestyle features and a hard-hitting political gossip column.
"Grist is a valuable, irreverent and highly readable addition to environmental journalism," says Philip Shabecoff, former New York Times environmental reporter and author of several books on the environmental movement.
An essential component of Grist Magazine is the Daily Gist, a FREE email news service that offers subscribers pithy summaries of top environmental stories from around the world, paired with provocative humorous headlines.
"The web is full of diversions, but there's only one thing I need every day, and that's Grist, " raves Bill McKibben, author of The End of Nature and Maybe One. "The Daily Gist is the best summary of what's happening around the country and the world; it comes with a point of view, but it's never dogmatic and always funny to boot." (sign up for the Daily Gist at

)
Grist's bold new look was officially unveiled at the annual conference of the SOCIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL JOURNALISTS last week in Los Angeles. Journalists from around the globe chuckled over Grist's trademark irreverence, searched our website for Earth Day Network groups in their part of the world, pitched story ideas for Grist Magazine and packed the Earth Day Network reception to chat with Denis Hayes, Chair of Earth Day Network.  The conference was a resounding success for Grist Magazine and for Earth Day Network.
