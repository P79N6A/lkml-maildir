It's just fits into "Everything is a file" and 
eliminates the need of a kill syscall.
Needs to be complemented with means to do
kill 0 ("All processesin the current process group are signaled"),
kill -1 ("All processes with pid larger than 1 are signaled") and
kill -n ("All processes in process group n are signaled").
