Hi!
> This patch implements the functionality of jumping between the kexeced

> 
> A new reboot command named LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KJUMP is defined to
> trigger the jumping to (executing) the new kernel and jumping back to
> the original kernel.
> 
> To support jumping between two kernels, before jumping to (executing)
> the new kernel and jumping back to the original kernel, the devices

> of devices and CPU is saved. After jumping back from kexeced kernel
> and jumping to the new kernel, the state of devices and CPU are

Seems like good enough for -mm to me.
