Sure.  The dual of this makes sense too: letting systemtap scripts
hook up to the mcount callback itself, for purposes beyond just
tracing the function calls.

(Note that kprobes are not the only event sources systemtap can use:
markers, timers, procfs control files, and some others.  Any
combination of these can be used in a script to express start/stop
decisions.)
