I wouldn't be so sure about that. SGI is already implicitly relying on
the parallel holding of rwsems for the lockless pagefaulting, and
Oracle has been pushing on mapping->tree_lock becoming an rwlock for a
while, both for large performance gains.

tasklist_lock is one large exception; it's meant for concurrency there,
and it even gets sufficient concurrency to starve the write side.
Try test_remap.c on mainline vs. -mm to get a microbenchmark-level
notion of the importance of mapping->tree_lock being an rwlock (IIRC
you were cc:'d in at least some of those threads).
net/ has numerous rwlocks, which appear to frequently be associated
with hashtables, and at least some have some relevance to performance.
Are you suggesting that lockless alternatives to mapping->tree_lock,
mm->mmap_sem, and tasklist_lock should be pursued now?
