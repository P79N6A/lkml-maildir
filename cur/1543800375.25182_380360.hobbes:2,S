OK.  This probably means that the parameters that control the mechanism 
need tweaking.
There should be a file /sys/cpusched/attrs/unacceptable_ia_latency which 
contains the latency (in nanoseconds) that the scheduler considers 
unacceptable for interactive programs.  Try changing that value and see 
if things improve?  Making it smaller should help but if you make it too 
small all the interactive tasks will end up with the same priority and 
this could cause them to get in each other's way.
Thanks,
Peter
