Yes, but...
The cases which my patch modifies are of a different kind:
	int parse_options(char *options)
	{
		char *p;
		/* for (p = strtok(options, ","); p; p = strtok(NULL, ",")) { */
		while (p = strsep(&options, ",")) {
			/* ... */
		}
		return 0;
	}
No temporary array, no kfree(). Our variable "options" is used for strtsep,
only. Notice btw. how we destoy the string content to which "options"
points with both strtok and strsep.
That said, it's possible I made a stupid mistake, of course. Or two. Do
you agree on the correctness of the code above? If not, forget the whole
thing and I'll try again later.
