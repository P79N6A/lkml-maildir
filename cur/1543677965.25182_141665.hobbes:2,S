You cannot order events unless you hold such events. One event always
arrives first. If it's the lower numbered, the point is moot. If it's the
higher numbered, you'll need to hold it or there's no ordering.
For the paranoid even that is not enough. A hotplug script may die in user
space due to OOM oe EIO.
