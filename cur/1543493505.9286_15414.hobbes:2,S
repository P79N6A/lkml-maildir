I'm not trying to claim that you don't know what you're doing, nor do I 
dispute that your figures are the true results you saw.  I was merely 
providing a theory for why your results showed (what appeared to be) rather 
poor performance, and asking whether you had attempted to find the cause for 
yourself.
There's no need to assume that everybody is out to get you every time 
something you write is challenged.
