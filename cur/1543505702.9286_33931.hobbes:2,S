Yes, but if you are going to need that boilerplate in every such driver
why not just put it in one place?  Then your API is just:
	readl_le(), writel_le()	/* Little endian */
	readl_be(), writel_be() /* Big endian */
	readl_ne(), writel_ne()	/* Native endian */
	readl(), writel()	/* aliased to *_le() for comaptibility */
The asm/io.h would only #define either the _le() or _be() variant as
appropriate for that arch (or maybe both if the CPU provides a fast
byte-swapped bus i/o), and then #include's <linux/endianio.h> which
would be:
	#include <asm/byteorder.h>
	#ifdef BIG_ENDIAN
	#ifndef readl_le
	#define readl_le(x)	__arch__swab32(readl_be(x))
	#endif
	#ifndef writel_le
	#define writel_le(x,y)	writel_be(__arch__swab32(x),y)
	#endif
	#define readl_ne(x)	readl_be(x)
	#define writel_ne(x,y)	writel_be(x,y)
	#else /* !BIG_ENDIAN */
	#ifndef readl_be
	#define readl_be(x)	__arch__swab32(readl_le(x))
	#endif
	#ifndef writel_be
	#define writel_be(x,y)	writel_le(__arch__swab32(x),y)
	#endif
	#define readl_ne(x)	readl_le(x)
	#define writel_ne(x,y)	writel_le(x,y)
	#endif /* BIG_ENDIAN */
	#define readl(x)	readl_le(x)
	#define writel(x,y)	writel_le(x,y)
Simple, easy, consistant, and complete.  All that's left to do is fix
drivers that depend on readl being readl_ne() instead of readl_le().

It's generic in the sense that its shared between a bunch of drivers.
