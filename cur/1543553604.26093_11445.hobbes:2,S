	Hello Robert ,  
Quote:	You probably want to buy the 66-mHz version instead, model
	PWLA8490SX, often called the "Pro/1000 F Server Adapter". 
	If memory serves me , this adapter has an on board processor with
	no way to disable it nor to use it (at present) under linux .
	If I am incorrect -please- correct me .  Tia,  JimL
