Right.  But it does one additional thing that the rtsig method doesn't
it collapses multiple readiness *changes* into a single readiness change.
This allows the kernel to keep a fixed size buffer so you never need
to fallback to poll as you need to with the rtsig approach.

Hmm.  /dev/epoll could and possibly should remove the readiness event 
if the fd becomes unready before someone gets to reading the
/dev/epoll buffer.  This is a natural extension of collapsing events.
But even with that it would still only give you the state as of the
last state change.  And it you have the state already it expects user
space to remember the state and not the kernel.  Which is both
different from /dev/poll and more efficient.
If the goal is to minimize system calls letting user space assume the
state is initially not ready.  And forcing a state query when
the fd is added should help.   I cannot think of a case where having
the kernel do the query would be necessary though.
If the goal is simply to provide a highly scalable event interface.
The current /dev/epoll sounds very good.  Though I'm not at all
thrilled with the user space interface.  As far as I can tell the case
of a fd becoming not ready is unlikely enough that it probably doesn't
need to be handled.
