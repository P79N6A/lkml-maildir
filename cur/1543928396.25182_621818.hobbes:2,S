hm.  Has anyone any evidence that we're actually touching
not-possible-cpu's memory here?
Also, the sum_vm_events() change looks buggy - it assumes that
cpu_possible_map has no gaps in it.  But that change is unneeded because
sum_vm_events() is only ever passed cpu_online_map and I'm hoping that we
don't usually online not-possible CPUs.
