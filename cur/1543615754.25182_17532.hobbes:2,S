Yes, indeed.  Seems RH-2.4.16-0.13 kernel still enforces disabling UDMA>2 for
VIA,
by means of setting cable type to 40w, even if 80w is present
#cat /proc/ide/via
------------   ---Primary IDE-----Secondary IDE------
Read DMA FIFO flush:          yes                 yes
End Sector FIFO flush:         no                  no
Prefetch Buffer:                    yes                  no
Post Write Buffer:               yes                  no
Enabled:                               yes                 yes
Simplex only:                         no                  no
Cable Type:                        40w                 40w
If I force higher UDMA by ide0=ata66 kernel option, as  discussed in RH bug
35274,
ide0 zero is set to UDMA5    (not the cable though) and everything is working.
I'll file a bug against RH kernel.
                Thanks everybody, Dmitri
