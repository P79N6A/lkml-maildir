We'll probably have the NMI watchdog ticking at a lower frequency anyway 
and isn't always enabled. Although i recall you want NMI watchdog on by 
default too on i386 (which i don't have a problem with). The reason for 
the external tool is because that allows more flexibility for profiling 
tools, that is more PMCs can be used if needed by the user.
