Subject: [RFC PATCH 2.4] ata_piix on ich6r in RAID mode

Jeff,
You might have come across this hack before, but I figured I should
remind you that it is still very useful for ata_piix...
Without this patch, if the BIOS of an ICH6R box has IDE set to "RAID"
mode then ata_piix will not find any SATA disks because it incorrectly
tries the legacy mode. With the patch all 4 SATA drives become visible.
I don't think it would break any other vendor's SATA, but you can be
the judge of that. If so, perhaps we can restrict the test some more
by checking vendor/device IDs.
