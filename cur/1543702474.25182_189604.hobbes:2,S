What if the host/bridge sets the RO bit on a PIO read?  That would
allow a PIO read response to bypass a DMA write.  Now, maybe that
doesn't make much sense with respect to PCI-X.  I think it's possible,
though.  Or can the RO bit only be set by a device?
In any case, if we can do a PIO read to one address space that flushes
DMA ahead of it or another address space that does not, then you would
need a separate version of readX, rather than an extra call to sync
after the read.
In theory, such a distinction would be useful for any platform that
uses separate paths for PIO read responses and DMA writes.  Perhaps
there is only one platform that has that feature?
