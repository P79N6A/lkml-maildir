Here's a note from USENET, with a little exploit script. I don't know
if the explanation is correct.
I hit this problem trying to compile gcc, the configure script would
fail with bizzarre errors at three or four different points. That is
if I did
rm -rf sparc-solaris2.5.1
mkdir sparc-solaris2.5.1
cd sparc-solaris2.5.1
../configure
several times in a row, it would fail at one of several points.
It would create a file or directory and then not be able to use
it, reporting an error that made me think that it was actually working 
on some other filesystem object. Also, files in .. were corrupted, and 
I don't think that configure should be doing anything but reading
them.

I have a strange problem with a Solaris machine connected to a Linux
server.
It seems that if, in rapid succession, a file is created, deleted, and a
new directory is created. In NFS the directory gets the same inode as
the previous file. For some reason, the Solaris box wants to think this
inode is a file until the nfs client refreshes. As you can imagine this
breaks a few scripts. Also, it does not happen 100% of the time (joy ;-(
).
I have a script:
>> resuse.sh
touch fubar
ls -i fubar
rm fubar
mkdir rabuf
ls -id rabuf
rmdir rabuf  
<<
When executed on a local disk, ext2 uses two different inodes. When
executed on an NFS volume, it uses the same "inode." 
The questions are:
Is the reuse of the inode on the NFS mounted volume a problem? or, is it
some other level of cache coherency protocol that is breaking down?
If it is a Solaris client bug, is there a work around?
If it is a Linux server bug, is there a fix?
So, before I start hacking nfsd, maybe it is already fixed ;-)
Also, has anyone else seen this behavior?
If you, can, respond by e-mail. Thanks.
