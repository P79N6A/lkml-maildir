Dear Linux Kernel Wisemen,
   I have been following the discussion of the VIA vt82c686b chipset
and the troubles people have had in getting UDMA(100) to work.  This
is to report that I have now tried the 2.4.2-ac20 kernel and the
2.2.18 kernel with Andre's patch (dated March 20) and neither of
them get the disk speed up to where it ought to be.  hdparm -t reports
back 11 MB/s or so for either kernel.
   VIA82CXXX enabled, and I also tried the ide0=ata66 flag, in desparation.
   At boot up both kernels report the disk as UDMA(100) - everything
seems to be peachy keen, but for the sluggish disk performance.
Merely a report from the front lines,
B.D.
