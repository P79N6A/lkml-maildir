Which really doesn't mean anything in many cases because there are many
ways to get data out of a file handle once you had it opened for write
including sharing via non file handle paths.
You also have to deal with existing mmap() mappings and outstanding I/O.
So here are some ways to break it
	SysV shared memory
	mmap
or just race it:
	Open the USER file
	create a new thread
	thread #1 create a pipe to a new process ("receiver")
	thread #1 fill pipe
	thread #1 issue write of buffer that will hold secret data
			[blocks after check for rights]
	thread #2
		wait for thread #1 to block
		read secret data into buffer
		send signal to "receiver"
	receiver now empties the pipe, the write completes and I get the
goodies.
This is why you need a proper implementation of revoke(2) in Linux. You
can't really do it any more easily.
