Sorry, I still cannot reproduce it.  I suspect it's specific to the access
patterns in some way.
Are you able to generate some simple testcase which demonstrates the
problem?  Say, start off from a clean boot, just mount a single filesystem
and then find some access pattern which causes the inode cache to get
stuck?
Also, perhaps the entire VFS cache reclaim mechanism got stuck - check the
logs for any oopses, because that can do it for sure.
And do a huge ls -lR on a local filesystem, check that the local filesystem
VFS caches are being correctly reclaimed.
