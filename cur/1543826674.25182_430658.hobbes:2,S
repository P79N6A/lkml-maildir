Any code which does mutex_lock() will have interrupts reenabled if the
mutex code was compiled in debug mode.

A couple of cycles repeated a zillion times per second for the entire
uptime, just because we cannot get our act together in the first few
seconds of booting.  How much does that suck?
And how much does it suck that we require that an attempt to take a
sleeping lock must keep local interrupts disabled if the lock wasn't
contended?
Fortunately, it only happens (or at least, is only _known_ to happen) when
mutex debugging is enabled, so the performance loss is moot.
I do not know where the offending mutex_lock()s are occuring (although it
would be super-simple to find out).
By far the best solution to this would be to remove this requirement that
local interrupts remain disabled for impractical amounts of time during boot.
Either whack the PIC in setup_arch() or reorganise start_kernel() in some
appropriate manner.
But I'll be merging
work-around-ppc64-bootup-bug-by-making-mutex-debugging-save-restore-irqs.patch
so we'll just continue to suck I guess.
