You are describing a transition plan without knowing what the final
design is going to look like. We really need to hash out the final
design so that the right path is taken to get there.
For example I didn't have per CRTC device nodes or user space consoles
in my original design, but after talking to some of the people that
really wanted the multi-seat feature it led me down the user space
console path and to the per CRTC device node solution. I also got beat
up at OLS by people wanting full Unicode support on the console.
