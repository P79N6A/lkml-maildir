Hi,
I have been getting recurrent lockups with 2.4.19. Usually when the
machine is idle and unattended. Often 10/day!!
Logs are always empty, SysRq unresponsive. Have rigged a serial
console - empty too.
Can I have some suggestions on how to get useful information for
debugging, either provoke/log an oops or get an eip?
CPU is K6, so APIC->NMI is not an option.
Have installed kdb, but cannot break in with that either.
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Mark
