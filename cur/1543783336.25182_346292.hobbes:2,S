The new processor was never brought up, its bit is only set in
cpu_possible_map, but not in present map. 
        ... 
        if (boot_error) {
                /* Try to put things back the way they were before ...
*/
                unmap_cpu_to_logical_apicid(cpu);
                cpu_clear(cpu, cpu_callout_map); /* was set here
(do_boot_cpu()) */
                cpu_clear(cpu, cpu_initialized); /* was set by
cpu_init() */
                cpucount--;
        } else {
                x86_cpu_to_apicid[cpu] = apicid;
                cpu_set(cpu, cpu_present_map);  <=====================
        }
        ...
So if someone tries to boot a CPU up first time during runtime it always
fails this check.
Thanks,
