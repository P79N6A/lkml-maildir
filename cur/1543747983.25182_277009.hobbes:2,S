What chipset is the motherboard ?

Windows XP and Linux may well hit the same problems with USB.

The latest FC3 kernel should have new enough -ac patches to run on boxes
with
totally broken BIOS IRQ routing. Try the boot option "irqpoll"

This is all interesting seen as one. It implies the BIOS handover failed
and
then we get an IRQ mess.

Ditto, and this is quite possibly the root cause. That suggests the BIOS
handover code for EHCI is insufficient for some cases (and it appears to
be looking at the code quickly - it should register IRQ 5 before doing a
handover which it does but it probably needs to just ack and mask IRQ 5
during the handover. It could be another device breaking IRQ5 however)
What occurs if you build a kernel with EHCI disabled, ditto what occurs
if you boot with init=/bin/sh and then load ohci before ehci ?
