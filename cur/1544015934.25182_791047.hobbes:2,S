Subject: [PATCH] hwmon: applesmc: Fix light sensor readings on newer MacBooks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Alex Murray <murray.alex@gmail.com>
The light sensors ALV0 and ALV1 on newer MacBooks (early 2008 and
later) changed to report 10 bytes instead the earlier 6, and the
sensor encoding subsequently changed. As a result, the reported light
sensors readings are much too low.
From experiments leading up to this patch, it seems only the ALV0 is
reporting data, and the most useful value therein is a 10-bit
big-endian value at offset 6. This suggests that a new protocol was
added as a backward-compatible replacement on top of the old one.
This patch makes applesmc report the improved light sensor reading for
the new machines, on a scale in conformance with earlier ones.
