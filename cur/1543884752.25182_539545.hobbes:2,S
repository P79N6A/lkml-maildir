How big is the trouble actually?
We have never and cannot guarantee stable module names (think of e.g. 
PATA, e100 or sky2/skge), so changed names are always possible when 
upgrading kernels.
Module aliases can solve many issues.
And sometimes it might even be an advantage that different drivers for 
the same hardware get different names (consider especially PATA).
Not changing the module names also has the problem that the old code 
must be removed from the kernel tree before the new one can be added
since two different modules with the same names could easily cause 
trouble - consider a user first compiling and installing the one 
modular, and then compiling and installing the other one modular (e.g. 
due to problems with the one he tried first). Which module will now be 
loaded by modprobe?
