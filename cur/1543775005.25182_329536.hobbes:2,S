I agree that the Linux madvise manpage is unclear and should be fixed.
If your interpretation of the problem is correct, then it should be
trivial to write a test program demonstrating the problem.  Did you
write the simple test program and run it?
I did, and the results make me think that the Linux implementation does
conform to the POSIX spec you quote.  I did not observe any data loss.
So it's just a documentation issue.
Besides, if you read the documentation closely, it does not say what you
think it says.
       MADV_DONTNEED
	      Do not expect access in the near future.  (For the time
	      being, the application is finished with the given range,
	      so the kernel can free resources associated with it.)
	      Subsequent accesses of pages in this range will succeed,
	      but will result either in reloading of the memory contents
	      from the underlying mapped file (see mmap) or
	      zero-fill-on-demand pages for mappings without an
	      underlying file.
You seem to think that "reloading ... from the underlying mapped file"
means that changes are lost, but that's not implied.
Also, the parenthetical near the top of the manpage "(except in the case
of MADV_DONTNEED)" is, AFAICS, wrong.  MADV_DONTNEED does not affect
semantics.  It looks to me like someone "improved" madvise.2 without
actually understanding what they were talking about.
Below is the test program I used.
