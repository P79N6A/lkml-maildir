Firstly you need to look up what compartmented mode implies. You cannot do
a single fixed memory pool on a compartmented mode system or processes can
signal across the security boundary using out of memory as indications.
You have to have some per security level swap pools or randomising (and the
per security swap pool is more effective anyway) since it stops people slapping
a viterbi codec across the memory signalling and laughing at your randomised
errors.
