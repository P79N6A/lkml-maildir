Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
This fixes compilation of 2.3.26 when APM is included but
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ is not.  It also removes a bit of no
longer needed doco.
To the world at large:
APM bugs/problems/feature requests can now be sent to
apm@linuxcare.com.au or submitted through the APM web
pages at 
http://linuxcare.com.au/apm/
Future patches will be on that web page.  This patch is
there as 
http://linuxcare.com.au/apm/2.3.26-APM.1.gz
Cheers,
Stephen

-  Enable the ability to power off the computer after the Linux kernel

-  halt(8) command ("man 8 halt")) to cause the computer to power down.

-  option may not work reliably with some APM BIOS implementations.

 Ignore multiple suspend/standby events
