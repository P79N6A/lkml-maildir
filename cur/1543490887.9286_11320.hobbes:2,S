This is nothing new, but since videomode changes (or going back to the
console) can and will make the bttv driver hang your system if a program is
using it and capturing, shouldn't it belong in 2.1.x and 2.3.x but NOT in
2.2.x ??
It's fun to be able to deliberatly hang Linux with a 'stable' kernel though,
haven't been able to do that for a while.
