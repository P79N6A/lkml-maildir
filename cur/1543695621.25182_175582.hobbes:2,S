Hi !
I just want to note that ACPI+3c59x is still not
working on the latest kernels - the only solution
is "acpi=off".
Affected are at least
IBM Thinkpad T21  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/15/111
IBM Thinkpad A21p (3c556B Laptop Hurricane)
This problem is really known for a long time and
Alan wrote on 21 Jun 2003 that it should work on -ac
trees.

dmesg output of my A21p (on 2.6.0-test9) can be found on
