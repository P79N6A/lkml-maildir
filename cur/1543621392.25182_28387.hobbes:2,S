what about those "legend" symbols that were in menus list but with
no menu declaration ?
ex:
menu usb        # USB? support
        USB_DEBUG
        usb_options_legend
        USB_DEVICEFS USB_BANDWIDTH USB_LONG_TIMEOUT
        usb_controllers_legend
        h:USB_UHCI? h:USB_UHCI_ALT? h:USB_OHCI?
...
I see no difference in use for usb_options_legend and USB_DEBUG.
