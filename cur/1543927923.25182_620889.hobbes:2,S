I think that's fair.

That's the reason we have a privilege model, not just for
MAC, but DAC as well. The Unix/Linux model where administration
and system tasks are performed by normal processes that are
just a little bit special, as opposed to a completely separate
set of interfaces, often makes things look a little contrived.
This is one of the advantages of SELinux, with it's model of
complete specification.

Weeeellllll... That's sort of what the "mandatory" is all about.

That SELinux doesn't require any capabilities is an artifact of
design on that LSM. The whole notion of privilege is somewhat out
of context when your model is to explicitly state how every possible
decision ought to go. That is one important philosophical difference
between SELinux and Smack, with Smack taking a higher level view
on policy and hence privilege.

I am pretty close to agreeing with Andrew that a distinction
between allowing a process to change the state of the MAC
configuration (e.g. set file or process MAC labels, add rules)
and violating the rules is in order. SELinux can ignore both,
AppArmor can ignore one, and the upcoming DG/UX port* can ask for
further granularity when they show up.
I will look in this direction and see if I can patches proposed
before the virus in my sinuses knocks me out completely.
Thank you.

*  DG/UX supported over 330 capabilities and is my personal
   poster child for excesses of granularity with regard to
   capabilities. I don't really expect to see a Linux port.
