Hi Dmitry,

Done. I used 2.6.6-mm1 (your patch succeeded), but there's still the same problem.
Well, at least I guess it's the same, because the errors in dmesg are looking different:
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 1
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 1
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 1
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 1
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 1
Synaptics driver resynced.
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 4
Synaptics driver lost sync at byte 1
Synaptics driver resynced.
[...]

No. No timeout at all.
Here's the output of "dmesg | grep serio"...I just thought this might be helpful:
serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX1 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio2
serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX3 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
