   That's highly broken because his libc was compiled against 2.2
   headers.  You must never use different headers in
   /usr/include/Pasm,linux} then those your libc was compiled against.
   
While I understand this problem, this line of reasoning simply does
not apply for headers that libc/glibc/whatever are agnostic about.
