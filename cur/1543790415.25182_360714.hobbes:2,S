BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000edbb0 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000cec11000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cec11000 - 00000000cee12000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cee12000 - 00000000cf68f000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cf68f000 - 00000000cf6e9000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6e9000 - 00000000cf6ed000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6ed000 - 00000000cf6ff000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000cf6ff000 - 00000000cf700000 (usable)
I see the stuff above, but the system doesn't contain any PCI device. I
didn't install a PCI-Express video card, because I still use the onboard
card.

The kernel is compiled for x86_64 and the term EM64T is correct. The
important question is now how do I remap that memory. Loosing almost a
full GB of memory wasn't my plan when upgrading to 4 GB.
