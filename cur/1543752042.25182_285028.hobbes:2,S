You are right, it should be separate that to init_amd and init_intel.
I guess for intel dual core initial apic id different to AMD.
It could be 0,7 for node0. 1, 6 for node1......
Amd would be (0, 1) for node 0, (2,3) for node1 ....

I don't think it will work at all on Intel HT systems, since
nobody initializes c->x86_num_cores there. phys_proc_id[] 
is supposed to be the same on two HT siblings.
You'll either need to initialize c->x86_num_cores on Intel too.
But since Intel seems to have dual cores upcomming and you'll
want HyperThreading support too it would need to be a new field.
Alternatively you can split the function for AMD and Intel and
use the new algorithm on AMD only.  Perhaps that's better.
In the later case I would only use it when CMP_LEGACY is set.
