No, the problem is your mail reader or configuration is broken.  Both 
Pine and Mutt both wrap lines just fine, and all the GUI interface I've 
used (in recent years) wrap just fine.  a) they aren't recognizing soft 
line breaks or b) you're not acknowledging lines sent without any wraps.
Letting users wrap text where they want to is the best policy.
