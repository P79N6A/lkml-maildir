Yes.

A comment from the top of fs/dcache.c:
/*
 * Notes on the allocation strategy:
 *
 * The dcache is a master of the icache - whenever a dcache entry
 * exists, the inode will always exist. "iput()" is done either when
 * the dcache entry is deleted or garbage collected.
 */
Basically, as long a a dentry is present, iput_final won't be called on
the inode.
