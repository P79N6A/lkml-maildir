I believe that the results returned will always be monotonic, as long as 
the frequency of the TSC does not change from under us (that is, without 
the kernel knowing). This is because we "synchronize" each CPU's vxtime 
with a global time source (HPET) every time we know the TSC rate changes.

I was not able to make vgettimeofday use vgetcpu(). It seemed like vgetcpu()
was not returning the same value as smp_processor_id() would, so the 
values I'd get with vgettimeofday() did not completely agree with the 
ones from gettimeofday(2). I didn't have the chance to investigate more.
