I suspect that Ingo is however correct - although a *proper* fix of one of
these bugs requires human-intelligence to figure out what's *really* intended,
the kconfig program *does* have enough information available to issue a a clear
warning:
"Yo doodz - I don't know *what* you intended here, but this SELECT is just
waiting to sink its teeth into somebody's posterior.  You might want to fix it
somehow before somebody needs rabies shots..."
There's a long tradition of toolchains issuing warnings about things that a
toolchain can detect, but cannot correct - for instance, the gcc 'variable is
used uninitialized' warning (distinct from the broken "may be used" warning).
Given the truly insane amounts of code we merge every cycle, we should take
advantage of every opportunity for automated detection of things that can't
possibly be right.
(Ingo - flame me if I've misread your position here...)
