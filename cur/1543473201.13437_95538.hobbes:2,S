No, no sign of a leftover server.
If the sound device were held open, I would expect an error "Cannot open
/dev/dsp" -  Sig 11 and a core dump is an indication of something a
little more problematical I think... I also notice that 2.1.133preX
kernels are j=having even bigger problems in this area.
I think I'll wait until 2.1.133 and try again.
Thanks anyway.
