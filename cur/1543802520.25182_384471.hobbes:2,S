With this send patch, kallsyms lookup first finds 
the real text address which is what we want. If you consider
this as the change in behaviour, what is the negetive effect of this
I am unable to get it.
In fact on arch which has the same address for 'U' and 't' type,
the search will first find the 't' type and ends the search soon, 
if we have my second patch.
