Assuming the 1010 has proper power isolation that makes sense and would
give you pretty much what was wanted. Especially as you can replace the
secondary server with a small system which does *nothing* but sync the
ramdisk back and so is far less likely to crash.
Does make you wonder why its not built into the violin ;)
