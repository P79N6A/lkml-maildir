10ms?  I see a 1ms sleep.

Definitely needs to be time_before/time_after.

No, because the test moved.
I came up with this loop (off the top of my head):
<willy>         for (;;) {
<willy>                 pci_read_config_word(pdev, pos + PCI_EXP_LNKSTA, &reg16);
<willy>                 if (!(reg16 & PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_LT))
<willy>                         break;
<willy>                 if ((jiffies - start_jiffies) >= HZ)
<willy>                         break;
<willy>                 msleep(1);
<willy>         }
Andrew has mostly followed that ... improving it to LINK_RETRAIN_TIMEOUT
instead of HZ.
Yes, the subsequent test should be of reg16 instead of jiffies.
And we should be using time_before/after instead of the explicit
comparison.
