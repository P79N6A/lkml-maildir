I don't think this is a fair - this is a common issue with any silicon 
supplier in recent times. For things like you mentioned - modems - end 
consumers don't care how ugly the implementation is - as long as it (a) 
works in their environment (b) is cheap.
Ugly to one person is design tradeoffs to another - you just don't agree 
with the tradeoffs someone else did. (And you might be right - I don't work 
on USB modems)

Yes that is correct - ADI is a big place, and there are many different 
groups here. The open source development group is small (but growing), and 
we all are trying to do the right things - all of our documentation is 
posted on our web site - or cvs. If you ask a question - ask on our forums 
- it will get answered.

I hope it can as well. If you have any thoughts on how we can interact with 
people better - let me know.
