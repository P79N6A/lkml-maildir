Hello,
I tested kernels test7pre5 and test7, and both fail to boot on an
UP pentium 100 box (i never saw a panic before on that box), they panic
in init,  kernel_thread. (i think)
that is , on my configuration, right after netfilter ipv6
initialisation. So after the netfilter ipv6 message, i see something
like this:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
0000001c
printing eip:
c010ff18
*pde = 000000
Oops : 0000
EFLAGS = 10286
eax = 00000000
ebx = ....
panic : trying to kill init.
but the call trace looked like this :
c0107007
c0107437
and when i grep for those in System.map, they give me kernel_thread and
init.
compiling ipv6 as a module and inserting it afterwards gives me no
problems
i will attach my .config, and i can also provide a binary image, a
system.map , everything you would like (i can reproduce the crash
whenever i want to, altough i verry rarely want to produce a crash ...).
if you have feedback, please cc to

greetings, thanks,
