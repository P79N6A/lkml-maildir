The correct solution to avoiding fs fuckups is to keep /tmp, /var and
/home separate. Basically, anything that gets written to for reasons
other than sysadmin/upgrades.
However, my point is not that it's always a bad idea to split /usr,
simply that the converse is not true. IOW, it is not true to say that
/usr *should* be split off. For a generic workstation, splitting /usr
is not useful. Importantly, it is most certainly entirely valid to
keep /usr on /.

In any case, my point is that splitting /usr wouldn't help, because
I'd want to preload stuff from there as well. Splitting /usr doesn't
address the problem.
