I explained myself very badly. My delta could be intended as the delta you
show above.
My delta instead is the time between _two_ schedule.
schedule()
{
	something
	real-rdtsc
	something
}
The important thing is that real-rdtsc is always run at the same offset
(and this is implicit enforced in the asm compilation).
schedule()
{
	real-rdtsc
	something
	something
}
This order would work fine too.
schedule()
{
	something
	something
	real-rdtsc
}
This order would be fine too.
Do you see my point now?
So there's no bug, but you are asking for a semantical change of
get_cycles().
