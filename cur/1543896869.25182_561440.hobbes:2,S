uvesafb is a generic driver for VBE2+ compliant video cards; an enhanced
version of vesafb and a direct successor of vesafb-tng [1].
uvesafb uses a userspace helper application (v86d, [2]) to run the x86
Video BIOS code.  This makes it possible to include in uvesafb all the
standard features (refresh rate control, video mode changes etc) that
are missing from vesafb without resorting to ugly hacks such as the ones
used in [1].  The current implementation of v86d can use either LRMI or
x86emu to run the BIOS code and supports both x86 and x86_64.
