That's because if you don't use the same geometry that the bios reports 
when calculating the CHS addresses of the sectors you intend to load, 
you won't be requesting the right sectors from int 13.

Generally yes, modern large disks will get clamped at 1024 cylinders, 
255 heads, and 63 sectors.  You seem to be arguing that this will always 
be the case.  If that is so, then the kernel doesn't need to store these 
values since it is known a priori does it?  But it isn't always going to 
be 255/63, there are some bioses ( I forget which ) that cap the number 
of heads at 240, and disks that are smaller than 8 gigs also will have 
less than 255 heads.
