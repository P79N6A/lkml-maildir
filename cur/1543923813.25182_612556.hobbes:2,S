The system wouldn't have worked as it did, if there were so many broken 
files before fsck. For example, the system booted properly before 
fsck. After fsck the grub was broken. So, most files that were 
corrupted, were unrelated to writes that happened that night. For 
example, many files at .deb cache at /var were corrupted, but it has 
been a long time since those were touched.

At least there were no IO errors in log files before that night. The 
only IO error that happened put filesystem into RO state.

Unfortunately, I do not have it.

I don't recall. I recall seeing messages about "too many blocks 
inside inode" and "clearing inodes". There were hundreds or 
thousands of these messages.
