Subject: incorrect help for NETLINK in 2.2.19

Hi all,
I think I've found some incorrect helptexts in 2.2.19:
I've compared the netlink config options for 2.2.19 with 2.4.5.
1. CONFIG_NETLINK - Enabling netlink
   The help in 2.4.5 seems correct to me.
   2.2.19 raves about nodes under /dev with major 36.  (BAD)
2. CONFIG_RTNETLINK - Route messages over netlink.
   2.4.5 seems good here too.
   2.2.19 tells us to create a /dev/route node.        (BAD)
3. CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV - Enable support for major 36 nodes.
   2.4.5 says that this option enables major 36 nodes.
   2.2.19 says nothing useful at all.                  (BAD)
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV enables major 36 char devices for both 2.2 
and 2.4, right? 
If that is true then I suggest that the 2.4.5-help for NETLINK
is used for next 2.2-kernel.
And - the help for CONFIG_RTNETLINK claims that data sent to the
kernel is ignored. Is that really true?
Tell me if you want a patch.
Thanks /
