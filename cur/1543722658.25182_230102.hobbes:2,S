If you defer updating the VFS until after the ->lock() call returns,
then it makes it difficult to protect yourself against races (as I
argued about the POSIX lock interface on the list yesterday).
If you have the underlying filesystem call flock_lock_file() itself,
then that gives it the freedom to implement its own locking scheme
around that call.
For instance NFS has a thread that is supposed to reclaim locks if the
server reboots. We take a non-exclusive lock on an rwsem to ensure that
we block it while there are outstanding locking RPC calls, however that
rwsem has to be released before we return from the ->lock() call, and so
there exists a race after the rwsem was released until the
inode->i_flock list is updated.
Cheers,
