Hey Peter,
Related question.
Since the patents have now expired for public/private key stuff held by
RSA, do you know if anyone ported a PKI to Linux open sourced with the
other crypto stuff?  Is there a BSafe equivalent around now that you
know of?  If so, I can get my NDS clone out the door on Linux.
:-)
