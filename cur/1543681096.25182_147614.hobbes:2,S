Well, I'd say it's a more common problem to have lots of writes, but it
is pretty easy to fill the queue with reads.

I believe elevator-lowlatency tries to solve the 'get a read in ASAP'
from a different direction, by trying to limit both the time required to
get a request and the time for required for the unplug to run.  Most of
my numbers so far have been timing reads in the face of lots of writes,
where elevator-lowlatency is a big win.
It should make sense to have a reserve of requests for reads, but I
think this should be limited to the synchronous reads.  Still, I haven't
been playing with all of this for very long, so your ideas are much
appreciated.
