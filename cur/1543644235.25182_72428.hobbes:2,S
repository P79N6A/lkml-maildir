udelay() should (note: should) busy wait for at least the requested delay.
It may wait longer though.
Its behaviour in the presence of speedstep type technologies where cpufreq
is not in use is a little undefined; almost anything can happen.  However,
with cpufreq in place, we adjust the delay value appropriately so that
a udelay() always sleeps for at least the requested time.
