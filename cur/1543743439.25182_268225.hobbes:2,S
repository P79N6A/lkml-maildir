Hi Matt,
[please CC: me on replies]
having had problems (inifinte hang on boot) with some Fujitsu
Siemens Scenic computers when EDD was enabled, I asked myself
if it would be possible to add a boot option edd=nombr and
possibly also another boot option edd=off to the EDD code in
the kernel. These would correspond to CONFIG_EDD_SKIP_MBR
and CONFIG_EDD, respectively.
That way, distributors could use the benefits of enabled
EDD on working machines and provide customers with the
ability to switch off EDD on broken machines, all with the
same kernel.
Yes, option parsing before entering protected mode is ugly,
but the vga setup code does it, too.
What do you think?
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
