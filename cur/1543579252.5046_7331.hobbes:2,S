CORK does not affect receive direction and, hence, ACK geneartion.
The problem is that TCP does not know, when full request is received
and it must ack instantly at connection start and after some idle
period to allow client to open congestion window. Hence, it has to send
redundant ACKs.
Some control on this is possible only from level parsing requests,
i.e. from httpd in this case.
Actually, TUX-1.1 (Ingo, do I not lie, did you not kill this code?)
does this. It does not ack quickly, when complete request is received
and still not answered, so that all the redundant acks disappear.
This feature is still unaccessible from user level though.
