Actually, thinking about this for 30 more seconds, I'm not sure how
another config symbol helps at all.  I do like splitting dependencies
onto multiple lines as a replacement for &&, so I have:
config INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS
	bool
	depends on INET
	depends on !(INFINIBAND = y && IPV6 = m)
	default y
right now.
Not sure if it's worth introducing another Kconfig symbol that depends
on IPV6 != n to avoid the
#if defined(CONFIG_IPV6) || defined(CONFIG_IPV6_MODULE)
tests.  I note that there are tons of that construction all over the
tree, and the places without it look somewhat dubious (eg
net/ipv4/ip_gre.c looks as if it will do the wrong thing if IPV6=m).
Maybe adding CONFIG_IPV6_ENABLED or something and cleaning up the whole
tree would be a good janitorial project?
