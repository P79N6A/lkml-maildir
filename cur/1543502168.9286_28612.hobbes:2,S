We've done that on linux-2.2.10-ac8 by applying two patches (attached),
one for the linux kernel and one for glibc-2.0.7-17 (they are almost
identical). The main library problem is the function initgroups() which
appeared to use a #define for the maximum number of groups. We have only
replaced /lib/libc-2.0.7.17 for this. It would be nicer if a separate
small system call library existed, offering a user mode sysconf() for the
_SC_NGROUPS_MAX parameter (and others). It could even try to calculate
it instead of using a #define from the linux include files.
Note that when you are using NFS there is a hardcoded limit in the
underlying RPC protocol of 16 groups. The first 16 groups are passed
to the server for permission checking, the others are ignored. I've
finished a patch for 2.2.10-ac8 which maintains a dynamic group list for
RPC, assuming the server will do UNIX style permission checking. If the
NFS client is not able to pass all groups then it might as well make a
reasonable selection of which groups to pass.
We are happily running linux-2.2.10-ac8 with 256 groups, even on NFS. I'll
first finish a similar patch for linux-2.3.9 (10?) before putting it
all on the mailing list.
