It's not an excuse, it's part of a coherent view of how things work. Just
as Netware used to have its, and DOS had its (sort of). As the world view
underneath Unix, it is darn hard to "fix".
[This discussion sounds quite a lot like it is /you/ who needs "fixing",
 i.e., first wrap your head around Unix' ways...]

Nope. SELinux provides MAC, i.e., mechanisms by which system-wide policy
(not the random owner of an object) ultimately decides what operations to
allow. That is not "file permissions". And yes, this is quite un-Unix-like.

If you ask me, preferably not at all, just let that unholy mess quietly go
the way of the dinosaurs. Sadly, interoperability is required at times,
so...
