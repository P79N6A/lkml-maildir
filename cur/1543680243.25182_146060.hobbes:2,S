Subject: [PATCH] AES for CryptoAPI - i586-optimized
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Due to the recent discussion about the asm-optimized version of AES which is
included in loop-AES, I'd like to point out that I've ported this
implementation - Dr. Brian Gladman's btw. - to CryptoAPI a long time ago.

The demand for this patch will rise quickly if cryptoloop is included :)
