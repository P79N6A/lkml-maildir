Hi all, apologies ahead of time if this mailing list isn't the correct one...
I'm having two issues here...
I've been trying to configure sofrware raid on my system
Kernel Version: 2.6.28-rc7
cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid0] [raid1] [raid10] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4]
md1 : active raid0 sdc2[1] sdb2[0]
      1952507776 blocks 64k chunks
md0 : active raid1 sdc1[1] sdb1[0]
      505920 blocks [2/2] [UU]
/dev/sdb and sdc are set up identically, both paritition types set to
"fd" so raid autodetect should work, md and related modules are built
into my kernel
/dev/sdb1               1          63      506016   fd  Linux raid autodetect
/dev/sdb2              64      121601   976253985   fd  Linux raid autodetect
I created the raids with the mdadm tool, originally configured manually
/dev/md0 for sdb1/sdc1 raid1 to be mounted as /boot
/dev/md1 for sdb2/sdc2 raid0
I created 3 partitions on md1, one for future /, one for swap, one for
future /home.
So I had /dev/md0, md1, and /dev/md1p1,/dev/md1p2/dev/md1p3
Upon rebooting, I end up with
d13f00l-desktop proc # ls /dev/md* -al
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4 Dec 17 19:13 /dev/md0 -> md/0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4 Dec 17 19:13 /dev/md1 -> md/1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4 Dec 17 19:13 /dev/md1p1 -> md/1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4 Dec 17 19:13 /dev/md1p2 -> md/2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4 Dec 17 19:13 /dev/md1p3 -> md/3
/dev/md:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    120 Dec 17 19:13 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root root  14680 Dec 17 19:13 ..

md1 is seen as the first partition on md1, instead of as the physical
raid with the additional partitions on it.
Even if i mdadm --stop md1, and do mdadm -A /dev/md1 /dev/sdb2
/dev/sdc2, md1 is seen as the first partition instead of as the whole
raid
fdisk:
Disk /dev/md1: 30.0 GB, 30000003072 bytes
2 heads, 4 sectors/track, 7324219 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 8 * 512 = 4096 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x609b513e
If I do mdadm -A /dev/md4 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2
and then fdisk md4, I see the partitions.
Disk /dev/md4: 1999.3 GB, 1999367962624 bytes
2 heads, 4 sectors/track, 488126944 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 8 * 512 = 4096 bytes
Disk identifier: 0xe96a943b
    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/md4p1               1     7324220    29296878   83  Linux
/dev/md4p2         7324221     7568362      976568   82  Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/md4p3         7568363   488126944  1922234328   83  Linux
Is something being autodetected wrong here, or am I doing something
wrong?  Should I not be creating partitions on a software raid device?
The other issue is that I can't get my system to boot off the raid.

At boot, /dev/md/1 is my root device.  It's an ext3 filesystem.  Ext3
is built into the kernel and all, as is the raid stuff.  When I boot
off sdb, i get a VFS panic, please append correct root= boot option,.
Cannot open device 0x10300
Am I doing something wrong here?
Thanks!
