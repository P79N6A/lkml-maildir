	I think you've just nailed one of the tricks right there.  A
long time ago, I just sat down and wrote up a "how the locking works in
the vfs" document for myself and others.  Wrote up the structures, what
each member is for, where the structure appears and disappears, and all
the call chains for all of the locks.  When I was done, I had a pretty
good idea of how everything interacted.
	I think this is a great trick for ramping up on a section of the
code - documentation is good, but you understand self-written
documentation better.
