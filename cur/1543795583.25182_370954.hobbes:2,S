Even nicer:  On Debian there's a "make-kpkg" command for building or  
cross-compiling a kernel source tree and creating a debian package  
from the result, and it can use "fakeroot" for all of the  
intermediate steps.  As a result, I can build a complete kernel  
package with "make-kpkg --rootcmd=fakeroot [...]" as an ordinary  
user, and then later install it as root with only one command: "dpkg - 
i linux-image-2.6.15-rc2_2.6.15-rc2-1_powerpc.deb".
