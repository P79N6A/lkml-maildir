Something Windows doesn't seem to be affected by so I don't think we'll

There are some calls in the ACPI layer which plays with the level/edge 
stuff but they don't seem very generic. Besides, what I want right now 
is just some possibility of confirming that this level/edge business is 
the cause of all these problems.

Ok. The default from the device is level mode which works fine on PIC 
systems. I'm not sure that the hardware actually respects this bit 
because level/pulse mode doesn't make any difference on either PIC or 
APIC systems.
