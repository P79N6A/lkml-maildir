That "expectation" is incorrect.  The device node will show up any time
after modprobe has started, just because modprobe returns does not mean

What's wrong with the /etc/dev.d/ location for any type of script that
you want to run after a device node has appeared?  This is an
application specific issue, not a kernel issue.
