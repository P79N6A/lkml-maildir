I'm still reading through the document, but it is testing against 2.5.73,
which was before Con's extensive scheduler interactivity improvements.
It looks like the ULE developers have created the tool, and test suite
needed to show problems with schedulers that has been asked for repeatedly
on this list.
Now all that is needed is for someone to put that in LTP.
It would be most interesting to see a comparison of each of Con's patches
that he made while testing out his ideas...
