Hi all,
I'm just wondering if there is any sort of documentation for the ptrace
request PTRACE_SETOPTIONS and its PTRACE_O_* flags available?
Or is this just some sort of "if you want to use this interface, read
the kernel sources" ? :)
The same question could be asked for PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG, PTRACE_GETSIGINFO
and PTRACE_SETSIGINFO.
