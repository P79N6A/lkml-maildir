With 2.6.12-rc1 (and rc2) the Multi_key on my keyboard gives mouse button 4
events. I found out that it is caused by the change in the atkbd.scroll
parameter (see drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c). If I change it to 0,
the keyboard is back at its old behavior. Probably Vojtech assumed it
was OK to switch it on by default. To me it seems that the default should
be off, since there are obviously conflicts with standard keyboards
(assuming mine is one).
Here is a patch that undoes the change.
