Why do you want to use such an interval? This makes everything only more 
complicated.
The largest possible interval is freq cycles (or 1 second without 
adjustments). That is the base interval and without redesigning NTP we 
can't change that. This base interval can be subdivided into smaller
intervals for incremental updates.
You cannot choose arbitrary intervals otherwise you get other problems, 
e.g. with your patch time_offset handling is broken.

You don't have to introduce anything new, it's tick_length that changes 
and HZ that becomes a variable in this function.
