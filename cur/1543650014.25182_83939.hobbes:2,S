I am obviously not being understood / not communicating myself clearly.
Your patch unconditionally adds a new function.
Don't do that.  Wrap it in an ifdef, like you propose below.

You're still missing the point here too.
Your patch has the potential to suddenly make systems unbootable, to 
suddenly reverse people's ethX interface numbering, etc.  No command 
line options in the world will save lkml from being deluged by tons of 
"my system doesn't network anymore" bug reports.
The basic point is "let's proceed with caution, and test test test 
before applying this patch."
