With some modifications perhaps. I don't know if I see the value tbh :-)

Hmmm. Yeah. I'm not sure what the general feeling is on this - I'm
tempted to say that we expect modules to be used and that if they're
not then the vendor/user has to do the hoop jumping for themselves.
This code won't stop you from making a monolithic kernel and
satisfying any module requirements for yourself :-)
