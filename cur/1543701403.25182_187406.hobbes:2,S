Have you had a look at dazuko. It provides a consistent file access
notification mechanism (and also intervention for denying access) across
linux and freebsd. It is currently being used by various on-access

Seems like a good idea. I've always thought it would be nice to use
something like this to maintain a dynamic locatedb (among many other
potential uses).
