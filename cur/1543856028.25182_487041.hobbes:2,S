Jarkko,
You're recorded as submitting the original patch to make this
non-static:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/diffs/drivers/mtd/cmdlinepart.c@1.11?nav=index.html
|src/|src/drivers|src/drivers/mtd|hist/drivers/mtd/cmdlinepart.c
Is this change correct?
If so, it should also delete the "needs to be visible" comment.
