Yup. At least 1500 byte ICMP echo packets get through the tunnel
OK.

I found a way to work around this problem. I had to tell _ALL_
the hosts on my local network to use an MSS of 576 for the default
route (the GRE tunnel). Thus the packets always fit through without
fragmentation and the problem is gone (but not solved). If someone
has a more elegant solution, please tell me. This one seems to be
poison for the Windows boxes on my network. :I
