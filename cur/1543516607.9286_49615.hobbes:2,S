I think that if you use the SuSE kernel you'll get a nicely patched well supported
LVM for which we are developing a reiserfs resizer which SuSE will also support.
(SuSE is a sponsor for ReiserFS.)  I expect that LVM will eventually make it into the
kernel,  all of the FS developers that I know of for Linux have recommended that
Linus add it.  If you use a SuSE patched kernel you'll just get it somewhat earlier
is all.

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
