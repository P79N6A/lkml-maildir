Standing back and looking at this...
afaict the whole reason for this work is to provide a quick-n-easy way to
get private mappings of hugetlb pages.  With the emphasis on quick-n-easy.
We can do the same with hugetlbfs, but that involves (horror) "fuss".
The way to avoid "fuss" is of course to do it once, do it properly then stick
it in a library which everyone uses.
But libraries are hard, for a number of distributional reasons.  It is
easier for us to distribute this functionality within the kernel.  In fact,
if Linus's tree included a ./userspace/libkernel/libhugetlb/ then we'd
probably provide this functionality in there.
This comes up regularly, and it's pretty sad.
Probably the kernel team should be maintaining, via existing processes, a
separate libkernel project, to fix these distributional problems.  The
advantage in this case is of course that our new hugetlb functionality
would be available to people on 2.6.18 kernels, not only on 2.6.22 and
later.
Am I wrong?
