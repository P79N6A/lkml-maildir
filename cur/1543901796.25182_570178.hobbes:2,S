Hi Remy,
Due to popular demand, I just ported LTTng 0.9.10 to 2.6.22.1-rt4. It
may deserve some more testing, but it runs fine on my x86_32. Please
note that I ported my last stable LTTng version, so some code is not as
shiny as the new one (work in progress), but it works. Please refer to
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
, mostly the QUICKSTART GUIDE and the compatibility
list.
On X86, everything should work fine. Just make sure that your
architecture has a stable and coherent TSC across CPUs. See
ltt/ltt-test-tsc.c (it printk a message at boot time) to see if yours is
ok. See my documentation on my website on how to tweak different
Intel/AMD if needed.
For your ARM needs, you may have to tweak include/asm-arm/ltt.h so it
reads a time base register (or the equivalent). Right now, it defaults
to use a logical clock, which is clearly not what you need.
I guess you'll want to disable the "userspace tracing", since I did not
port ltt-usertrace, so it's not very userful then, and also disable the
"locking instrumentation", which generates a _lot_ of output.
I know Thomas and Steven were also interested in this port.

Mathieu
P.S. : To give you an idea of the output: (you know the CPU id with
processes_1 or processes_0)
./lttv -m textDump -e "event.name=sched_schedule" -t /tmp/trace2
(System at 250HZ with PREEMPT_RT)
A little legend:
group.event          : time since boot, in s.ns (tracefile name, ending
with cpu ID), Thread ID ("pid"), Thread group ID (posix pid), process
name, thread name (need userspace instrumentation), Parent PID,
Userspace function (need userspace instrumentation), execution mode
(SYSCALL/USERMODE/TRAP/IRQ...) { event specific data }
The event specific (raw) data for sched_schedule is:
PID out
PID in
previous state : State of the process we are scheduling out : -1
                 unrunnable, 0 runnable, >0 stopped
