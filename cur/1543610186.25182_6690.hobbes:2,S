Maybe the way to stop this sort of problem is to enforce it in the kernel 
build procedure/Makefiles (and/or in the module's build procedure, if it's 
separate to the kernel's).
Eg: Anything that produces output code (bzImage, modules, etc) should fail 
if .config is newer than any of the dependencies. Maybe even spit out a 
"You need to run 'make dep' before using 'make bzImage'" or something like 
that. If they really want to get round it, they can play with 'touch'.
This seems perfectly logical to me.
