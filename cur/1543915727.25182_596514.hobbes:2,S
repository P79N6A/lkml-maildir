/* If array != NULL, pointer of unmapped pages are stored in array[] */
extern int vunmap(const void *addr, struct page **array);

But yes, this costs.

Hm, it seems all your patch are for hiding usage of vmalloc()/vmap().
If freeing pages[] array is also hidden in your patch's context, no problem.
