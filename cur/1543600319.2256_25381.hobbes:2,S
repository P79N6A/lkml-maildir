Subject: PATCH : admit htmldocs exists in nano-HOWTO

Following patch updates the kernel doc nano HOWTO to inform readers that
htmldocs can be made directly, and documents one of the possible errors
that can be produced when miscoding comments for DocBook.
Applies cleanly to 2.4.10-pre4 and 2.4.9-ac6.
