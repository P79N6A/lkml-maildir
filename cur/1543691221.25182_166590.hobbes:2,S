You're welcome.

Well, I've sent it to lkml once or twice some years ago. It was apparently 
lost in the noise and I personally didn't care much resending it because 
nobody else reported a similar problem. So I've just included it in my 
local patchset - just the "fixed and forget because nobody else reports 
this problem" case ;-)

Right, except for some fuzz the patch should work with both 2.4 and 2.6 - 
at least it does for me. I'm not sure if this is the best possible way to 
work around the issue. But it does the job and I've taken considerable 
care to avoid breaking other boxes.
Of course I personally have no objections wrt. including it in the 
official tree. Russel, what do you think - do you want to apply it? Or 
shall I send it to Greg directly?

No idea - sounds strange to me. No such problem here with any of 
serial_cs, pcnet_cs or orinoco_cs with my ob800 (neither 2.4 nor 2.6).
