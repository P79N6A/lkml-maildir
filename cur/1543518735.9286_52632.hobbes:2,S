smp_call_function() has a "nonatomic" paramter. If this variable is set,
then smp_call_function will schedule() until the required data structure
is available.
3 functions use smp_call_function():
* flush_tlb_all(): loops until the semaphore is free. On UP, this would
be a lock-up, but AFAICS, the semaphore cannot be busy on UP.
* smp_send_stop(): calls smp_call_function() with disabled interrupts,
but with nonatomic=1. This means that panic() could schedule.
* mtrr.c: calls smp_call_function() with disabled mtrr's and disabled
local caches.
--> smp_call_function() must not schedule().
What about removing the "nonatomic" parameter, and replacing the
semaphore with a spinlock?
Btw, the alpha implementation of smp_call_function uses a
"pointer_lock()" function. What's a pointerlock? It calls schedule()
without setting SCHED_YIELD, it looks like a broken semaphore.
