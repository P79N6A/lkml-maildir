I can reproduce my crash using mtu sized pkts running only 50Mbps send + receive
on 2 nics.  It took over-night to do it though.  Running as hard as I can with
MTU packets will crash it as well, and much quicker.
Interestingly enough, the tg3 NIC (netgear 302t), registered 57 deg C between
the fins of it's heat sink in the 32-bit slots.  Makes me wonder if my PCI bus
is running too hot :P
Dave says I'm wierd and no one else sees these bizarre problems, btw :)
More trouble-shooting to follow this next week.
Thanks,
Ben
