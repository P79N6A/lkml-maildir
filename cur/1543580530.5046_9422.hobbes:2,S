Subject: [RFC] New Improved Cleaner Whiter Timer Interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's an improved timer interface as suggested by Rusty and elaborated
by me.  It turned out that the original problem I set out to solve was
already solved (and this approach would not have solved it anyway) but
there is a compelling reason for taking this seriously: there are four
fewer spinlock ops per timer cycle on SMP.  UP is slightly faster too,
though the difference isn't nearly as dramatic.  There are two changes
from the existing interface:
  1) Rescheduling is done by run_timer_list, not by the timer itself. 
The timer event returns a value indicating how far in the future it
should be rescheduled, 0 => don't reschedule (one-shot).
  2) The parameter passed to timer->event is (struct timer *), not long
int data, allowing the timer to identify itself and perhaps modify its
data or event field.
To ease the pain of this incompatible interface, this patch retains
compatibility with the old style interface, and the cost of this is just
a one test.
The second of the two patches below shows typical usage.
