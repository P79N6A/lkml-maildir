Hmm - it was something like an hour after resume when the problem started,
Here is timed part of the same backtrace:
[65627.782972] wlan0: associate with AP 00:11:d8:da:65:40
[65627.785569] wlan0: RX ReassocResp from 00:11:d8:da:65:40 (capab=0x401 
status=0 aid=8)
[65627.785576] wlan0: associated
[69541.209873] wlan0: No ProbeResp from current AP 00:11:d8:da:65:40 - assume 
out of range
[69541.810104] iwl3945: Error sending REPLY_SCAN_CMD: time out after 500ms.
[69542.309861] iwl3945: Error sending REPLY_RXON_ASSOC: time out after 500ms.
The begging of my trace looked similar.
Should I open new bugzilla separately ?
