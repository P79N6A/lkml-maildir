I doubt. I emailed with Alan Cox back in 2000 (when VMware 2.0 was to be
released), and he told me that there is no way vmmon & vmnet could find
its way into kernel, regardless of license we'll pick. 
We do not have to go for examples very far - bochs currently does not
provide any networking backend which would work like real network card,
without any restrictions on MAC addresses, host-guest or guest-guest
communications. Patch to get it to work over vmnet's interface was task
for half of one afternoon. Would that change opinion of peoples who accept
only free software? I doubt...
So for now it will probably stay way it is - updates are semi-regullary
distributed from my site, some distros picks them up and repackage for
their customers, and everybody is happy that it more or less works.
