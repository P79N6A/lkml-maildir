Interesting, but how does that work from a user's/hardware perspective?
Do I have to pull DSR/RI to +12V? Can I use one of the other pins to get
these +12V (i.e. a switch and a resistor to shorten these pins is
enough)?
And probably in the BIOS I have to enable "wake on modem ring" (or
something similar)?
