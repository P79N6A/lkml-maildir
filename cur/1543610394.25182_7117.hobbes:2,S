I have a fairly recent version.  I boot it into windows for class once
or twice a week (shoot me, I find it easier to take notes in MS Word,
than in AbiWord), and since the classroom is wired for wireless ethernet
I usually use that time to use IBM's automated utility to check for
updates, and it checks and updates the bios appropriatly if there are
any updates.
