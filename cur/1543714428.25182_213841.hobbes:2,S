I think I tracked it down now.
During 'make bzImage' the directory .tmp_versions was deleted and created.
This is only supposed to happen when building modules.
This does not match your failure report 100%.
I assume what you did was something like:
make bzImage
make modules
make install		<= This would trigger the above case
make modules_install
Or maybe you inverted the two:
make modules
make bzImage
Anyway here is the fix.
Please let me know if you still se problems.
