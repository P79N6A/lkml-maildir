I am skeptical.
I have never seen any convincing evidence for this claim,
and I suspect that there are cases in which /dev/random fails
to achieve this standard.
And it seems I am not the only one.  See, e.g., Section 5.3 of:
http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/029
Fortunately, it doesn't matter whether /dev/random provides
information-theoretic security.  I have reasonable confidence that
it provides computational security, and that is all that applications
need.
