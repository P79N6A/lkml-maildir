I can't speak for the others being known, but I posted a fix for the
microcode.ko one the other day.  That one was pretty clearly a EXPORT_SYMBOL
line that got overzealously removed in 2.5.47 (the next 4 EXPORT_SYMBOLS in the
file got removed as part of a code cleanup, one line too many got nuked, I
guess)
I had a few others that went away when I upgraded to Rusty's 0.9.8 version
of module-init-tools that correctly dealt with EXPORT_GPL_SYMBOL....
