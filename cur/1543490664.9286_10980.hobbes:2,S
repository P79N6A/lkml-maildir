hardirq_unlock() doesn't exists and hardirq_endlock is a nono, so the
patch won't avoid irq to be nested.
And in general it make no sense to avoid irq to be nested this way because
you can always have tons of irq handlers that are smart enough to run with
irq enabled.
I have some idea and I'll implement it shortly.

Bad enough to be such kind of problem... I bet you are using SCSI ;).
Well to know if the stack is the problem you can do things:
1) grab the patch-ikd from:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/patch-ikd-arca/patch-ikd-arca-2.2.3.gz
and enable my kernel-stack-meter and the kstack overflow detector. This
way you'll know the lower level your stack size reached since kernel boot
(via /proc/sys/debug/stack-meter if I remeber well). And if you are really
going to overflow you'll get a panic or an explicit printk (if I rember
well).
2) change by hand in arch/i386/kernel/process.c in alloc_task_struct the
__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,1), with a vmalloc(PAGE_SIZE*2), and in
free_task_struct() change the free_pages() with a vfree().
Recompile, reboot, and wait an Oops with a page-fault in a vmalloced area
PAGE_SIZE aligned (since there is a gap of one virtual not-MMU-mapped page
between two vmalloc mappings, you'll get an explicit Oops instead of
silenty MM corruption).
In the meantime as just said I'll try to do some things I thought to
improve the kernel stack safety.
