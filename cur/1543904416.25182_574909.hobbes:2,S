Another issue is that if you have a conditional trap instruction on
your cpu, and you try the __label__ trick, GCC no longer converts:
	BUG_ON(test)
into just a:
	set condition codes;
	conditional_trap;
sequence because the "stuff" inside the basic block is something
more than just the __builtin_trap().
The holy grail would be being able to get the perfect conditional
trap sequence, plus the annotations in a seperate section.
