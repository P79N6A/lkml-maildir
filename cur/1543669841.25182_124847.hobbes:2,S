Ok, this puzzles me a bit - 
i just upgraded 2.5.67 to -mm2, and it won't boot it just stalls after 
'Booting Linux kernel....' or something similiar - and nothing. 
I have CONFIG_VT=y and CONFIG_INPUT=y set, which is why i don't get it -
that was the problem with 2.5.67, but i fixed that, and the .config
should be intact after patching the kernel, shouldn't it? 
Any suggestions ?
