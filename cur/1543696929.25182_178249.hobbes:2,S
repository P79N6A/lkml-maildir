> Probably too late for 2.6.0, but here is a patch that disables noirqdebug:
Why dont you just disable it during boot somewhere in sgi ia64 specific
code? It doesnt seem right to disable this after all the driver effort
it took to make it work.
And yes Im a paid up member of the "we build stupidly big machines"
club. I'll disable where applicable in ppc64 specific code.
