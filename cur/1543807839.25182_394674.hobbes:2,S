Yes, but how are you going to get it started from (say) klaptop, which only 
knows "echo disk > /sys/power/state" as the way of starting a suspend? I'm 
suggesting that we create a means whereby the issue of how to start a 
cycle could be separated from what implementation is used to do the work. 
That is, a simple extension at the start of the disk specific code that 
starts swsusp, uswsusp or suspend2 depending upon what you want. Maybe I 
should just prepare a patch.

Nigel
