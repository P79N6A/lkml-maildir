you are apparently arguing in a circle. This is a debug mechanism. It 
goes the normal upstream acceptance process. I have booted this patch a 
few hundred times on a number of boxes and got not a single false 
positive so far. While this is in no way an exhaustive test, only more 
testing (in -mm, etc.) will tell us more, one way or another. Your 
negative feedback about an impending catastrophy has been duly noted 
(which vision of yours has not been shared by anyone else in this thread 
so far), and is given its due weight. Can we now please move on to a 
more productive stage?
