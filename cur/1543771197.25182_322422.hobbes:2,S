It's best to avoid using NUMA-specific data structures, even in #ifdef
NUMA code.  This particular use is incorrect, as the zone_table[] is not
indexed by numa_node_id(), but rather by a combination of the node
number and the zone number (see NODEZONE()).
I'd suggest using something like this:
	if (zone->zone_pgdat->node_id == numa_node_id())
It might be nice to have a zone_node_id() macro that hides this as well.
With a macro like that that #defines to 0 when !CONFIG_NUMA, the #ifdef
around that function could probably go away.  
Also, are you sure that you need the local_irq_en/disable()?
