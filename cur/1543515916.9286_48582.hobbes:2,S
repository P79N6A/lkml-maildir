That's the wrong way to do it. 
We need a new file_operations entry, rw_kiovec.  So it looks like
	sys_write->block_rw_kiovec->sd_raw_write->sd_raw_rw
and	vmdump->make_dump_kiovec->sd_raw_write->sd_raw_rw
The kiobuf management should _all_ be done at the level where we are
originating the block IO, not in the per-device operations.
