People using my IP masqueraded subnet complained to me that they
can't access some websites from their workstations. I looked into
this problem and saw something VERY strange happening.
When I try to access one of the inaccessible websites, the value in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag is incremented by one! Shouldn't
it always be 0 or 1? When I try to connect with lynx, it get stuck at
the "waiting for reply" stage. All the websites work fine from the
masquaradeing box.
I'm using vanilla 2.2.13 on an intel pentium 233Mhz MMX. The box is
connected to the internet via 64k ISDN. The workstations are running
Win95, Linux and NetBSD.
Additionally, I know someone else is also experiencing the same
problem, but I also know that some people are using IP masq with a
similar setup without any problems.
