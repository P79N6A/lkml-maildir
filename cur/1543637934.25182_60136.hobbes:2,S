There is nothing in the funding mechanism that causes features to go in, 
merely to cause features to get paid for.
Do you understand that capitalism has this problem in general, that when 
consumers/users decide who gets money they make a lot of mistakes.  The 
only thing we know is that when the experts of production decide things 
instead the results are usually worse (communist systems have things 
determined by producers not consumers, though it must be said that there 
are some things that communists designed better than the west).
Not seeking perfection, just improvement....
