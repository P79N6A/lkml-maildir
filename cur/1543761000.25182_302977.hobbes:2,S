But that's going to warn when the deprecated function itself is compiled,
isn't it?
If so, that's backwards.  We want to warn when the deprecated function is
_used_, so people go fix up their code, and we can then remove the
deprecated function.
(The intermodule_register and pm_register stuff has been hanging around for
so long that one wonders if we need sterner stimuli, not lesser).
