Soon I would hope. The modalias attribute currently only supports one
alias (i.e. one line). This isn't enough for PNP, so if we want to
support that bus (which I assume we do) we need to extend the interface.
udev could be updated and be backwards compatible, the kernel can not
(excluding adding another interface to the same data). So this patch
should lag the update to udev a bit (i.e. I'm not suggesting it be
applied now).
