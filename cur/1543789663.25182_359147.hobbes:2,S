Hi Helga (et al),
I'm just back on this issue and am trying to make changes to the basic 
xorg.conf without yet connecting the 2nd VGA,Kyb & mouse.
I thought if I set up a template for the config then it would be easier 
to copy & make changes for when I connect the 2nd KVM devices.
I'm having a problem with the "Dev Phys" option as I keep getting:
(EE) Generic Keyboard: cannot register with evdev brain
No core keyboard.
(man xorg.conf does not show "Dev Phys" - should it not be "Device" ??
The real issue is that I cannot find the keyboard device in /dev/input 
(Ubuntu 5.04 )
In /dev/input I only have 6 devices: event0, 1 and 2; mice, mouse0 and ts0
Are you able to tell me what parameter to put in this Option "Dev Phys" ?
TIA,
Zoltan
