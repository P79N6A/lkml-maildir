   You'll have to reboot to clear it. I believe this is a kernel
   bug. Try going back to 2.2.14, or maybe up to 2.2.19pre2.
He needs to go up if anything.  His sparc64 OOPS had strings in the
kernel stack, which is indicative of a sparc64 specific bug I only
fixed very late in the 2.2.18 patches.
Later,
