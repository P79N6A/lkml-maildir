True.  Perhaps the BIOS is having trouble.
Many boards require a BIOS upgrade to correctly cope
with 37GB drives.

Yeah.. I'm not too hot over that either.
The '-i' was supposed to be a boot-time snapshot
of the drive identity, but in recent kernels it seems
to be becoming more dynamic (in the IDE driver).  What a shame.
And '-i' was supposed to be the current info,
but it has been messed up somewhat.  I may fix that
in a new version of hdparm, sometime next century.
