In any case, given Linus's note, it appears that atomic_read() and
atomic_set() won't consistently have volatile semantics, at least
not while the compiler generates such ugly code for volatile accesses.
So I will continue with my current approach.
In any case, I will not be using atomic_inc() or atomic_add() in this
code, as doing so would more than double the overhead, even on machines
that are the most efficient at implementing atomic operations.

They work, but are a bit slower.  So they do work, but not as well.

Well, that certainly would be a point in favor of "volatile" over inline
asms.  ;-)

The local_irq_save/restore are something like 30% of the overhead of
these two functions, so will be looking hard at getting rid of them.
Doing so allows the scheduling-clock interrupt to get into the mix,
and also allows preemption.  The goal would be to find some trick that
suppresses preemption, fends off the grace-period-computation code
invoked from the the scheduling-clock interrupt, and otherwise keeps
things on an even keel.

Or that needs to resolve similar races with IRQs without disabling them.
One reason to avoid disabling IRQs is to avoid degrading scheduling
latency.  In any case, I do agree that the amount of code that must
worry about this is quite small at the moment.  I believe that it
will become more common, but would imagine that this belief might not
be universal.  Yet, anyway.  ;-)

Given some low-level details of the current implementation, I could
imagine manipulating rcu_read_lock_nesting on entry to and exit from
all NMI/SMI handlers, but would like to avoid that kind of architecture
dependency.  I am not confident of locating all of them, for one thing...

Agreed!
