Aside from the real/protected mode issues (which are pretty much a 
show-stopper right there), the performance would be horrible. Usually 
the Interrupt 13 code on especially the more advanced controllers like 
hardware RAID, etc. is designed solely to function, with little 
attention to speed, and the performance tends to be horrible - look at 
versions of Ghost that run into DOS and look how long it takes to image 
a drive connected to an IBM ServeRAID controller..
