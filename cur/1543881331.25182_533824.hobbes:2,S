That's not where the problem lies - the namesys guys are responsive and play
well with others.  But they haven't received any "requests for the various code
changes" in over a year.
And I'm in the same boat as most everyone else: I haven't looked at the reiser4
code in ages.  Right now I don't have anything like a list of outstanding
technical issues.
To get it unstuck we'd need a general push, get people looking at and testing
the code, get the vendors to have a serious think about it, etc.  We could do
that - it'd require that the namesys people (and I) start making threatening
noises about merging it, I guess.
Or we could move all the reiser4 code into kernel/sched.c - that seems to get
people fired up.
