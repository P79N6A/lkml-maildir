I was thinking that an interrupt actually happening on that irq would set 
the "already done" flag, so that if it's a high-rate irq, then we'd not 
inject any new fake ones.
So the algorithm would be something like "clear the 'already done' flag 
every five seconds, and sending the fake one if it was already cleared", 
with normal interrupts always setting the flag.
And yes, you could still hit it in a blue moon (nothing happened for five 
seconds, and then it happens _just_ as we send a fake event), but if the 
only thing we do is do a printk() on it, no big deal if you get a false 
positive every five years.
(The bigger problem is that some drivers just return IRQ_HANDLED whether 
they had work to do or not, because people - including me - were lazy in 
some of the conversion of the irq_handler_t stuff).
I dunno. It _sounds_ simple enough..
