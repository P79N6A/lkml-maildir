Indeed.  It was not only bash, though, I fixed probably a dozen
applications.  But even the new and better solution (readdir of
/proc/self/fd) does not prevent the problem of closing descriptors the
system might still need and the application doesn't know about.

I don't like special cases.  For me things better come in quantities 0,
1, and unlimited (well, reasonable high limit).  Otherwise, who gets to
use that special namespace?  The C library is not the only body of code
which would want to use descriptors.
And then the semantics: do these descriptors should show up in
/proc/self/fd?  Are there separate directories for each namespace?  Do
they count against the rlimit?
This seems to me like a shot from the hips without thinking about other
possibilities.
