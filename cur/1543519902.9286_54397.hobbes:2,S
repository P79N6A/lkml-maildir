The above make not a lot of sense to me. The only point for disable_irq is
to avoid the irqsave in the global_lock_irqsave on the left.
Right code that doesn't want to clear irq for a long time should do:
	disable_irq_nosync();
	spin_lock();
				irq_enter
				spin_lock;
Using disable_irq_nosync() is faster (achieve the best parallelism
possible as we'll block only on the spinlocks) but disable_irq() could be
used too safely. In the example a slower disable_irq() is not necessary
because the critical section is protected by a spinlock also inside the
irq handler.
Disabling irqs (mainly the ISA irqs) is slower than a cli, so if the
critical section is small and there's no I/O the strightforward irqsave
way is faster than disabling one only irq.
