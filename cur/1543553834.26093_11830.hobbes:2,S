Still, it is so logical.  Modules cannot be unloaded when in use.
"use" is usually "someone having the device open".  But
"someone listening to pass-through sound" is effectively using
the mixer - the module is in use in another way.  Network drivers
don't have a /dev/xxx to open/close either.
Having to turn off the master volume before unloading makes sense
to me.  (The driver may still free up DMA buffers when
nobody need them, i.e. when /dev/dsp haven't been used for some time.)
