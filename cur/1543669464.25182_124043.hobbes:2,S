Hi,
In linux RH 7.3 and 8.0.
    When we are trying to compile our driver, it is giving the following
error
In file included from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/prefetch.h:13,
                       from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/list.h:6,
                        from
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/linux/module.h:12,
                        from k_compat.h:103,
                       from madgecb.c:31:
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/processor.h:56 :
`CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT' undeclared here (not in a function)
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/processor.h:56 : requested alignmnet is
not a constant
make : ***[madgecb.o] Error 1
We have used our own k_compat.h because with 7.1 pcmcia package,
k_compat.h was not provided.
We tried compiling with pcmcia/k_compat.h also. It is giving the same
problem.
But if we copied /usr/include/asm/processor.h to
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/processor.h
then the problem is going..
The difference between the header inclusion in
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/processor.h and
/usr/include/asm/processor.h is in
/usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/processor.h there is an extra
<linux.cache.h>
cache.h is including <linux/config.h> and <asm/cache.h>
<linux/config.h> is including <linux/autoconf.h> where
CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT is defined.then why this problem is coming.
What can be wrong?
