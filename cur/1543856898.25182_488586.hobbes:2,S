I presume this is the macro defining key, used on keyboards like the 
Gateway102. I thought it was handled internally and didn't send a 
keycode, but other keyboards had/have that feature as well.
Used G102 for application work, had the function keys both next-to and 
above the alpha keys, so you could bind up to 48 application functions 
and still have function keys as other things wanted them.
Hope that answers your question.
