Red Hat did that for glibc-2.1.9 and glibc-2.2 in RHL-7.0.
Hundreds have complaind about /usr/include/linux
not being a sym link to /usr/src/linux/include/linux.
The kernel headers for glibc are form a pre 2.4.0 kernel
and should probably be updated along with a new glibc
built against the new headers.
I've had no problems with it so far, been running since the
pinstripe beta release.
