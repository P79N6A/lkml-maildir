OK, I'll think about it.

Thanks for the detailed analysis!
Anyway, as far as I know, copyright covers copying of works, and dynamic
linking never creates anything suitable for copying.  The "derived work"
stays in memory, just like it does when a proprietary program runs on
top of the Linux kernel.  Memory dumps might be illegal to distribute
though.
I'm not a lawyer and the above is not a legal advice.  I don't represent
Free Software Foundation.
