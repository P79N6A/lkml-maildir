   Im quite sure. The patch looks fine for me. I actually tried this
   some days ago , it fixed the stalls even with the broken
   cleanup_rbuf() function.
My current contention is that the probe0 timer is meant to probe zero
windows.  That is, at the sender, it is meant to send a nop packet to
the other end to see if the window has grown past zero at the
receiver.  It is not a method to ensure ack reliability from the
receiver's point of view, it is a sender mechanism engaged when a zero
window is received in an ACK.
People seem to have their understanding of these roles reversed.
Or am I misreading things?  Anyways, I'm studying this more deeply
right now.
