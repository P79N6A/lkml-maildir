Something about the scheduler change in 2.2.8 exposed 
latent problems in the SMP startup code.  This is a 
substantial rewrite of that.
Also included are the CIX->FIX instruction set extension
change, some timing fixes, and smp_call_function.
Hope this works for folks.  It's been up for all of 5 
minutes here, and I'm going on vacation this afternoon.
See you at Expo.
