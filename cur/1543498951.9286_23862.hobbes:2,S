Hi,
I'm trying to get 2.2.7-ac2 running on a Samsung UX board with onboard
Symbios 53c875 scsi. But every time i boot it i get:
<detects it as 53c875, irq,port, etc all correct>
CACHE TEST FAILED: script execution failed.
<and then:>
CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED.
<then it gives up, and the kernel can't mount it's root fs.
This happens with both the sym53c8xx and ncr53c8xx drivers on 2.2.7-ac1 and
ac2, but works fine with 2.2.9. (milo never has problems either). I've tried
loads of different config options. Even copying the sym53c8x* files from
linux-2.2.9/drivers/scsi over to 2.2.7-ac2 didn't work - exact same problem
on boot.
I also downloaded the latest sym53c875 1.5 patches from ftp.tux.org but it
fails to link vmlinux with undefined references to remap_pci, unmap_pci (and
1/2 other functions which i can't remember) in sym53c8xx.o. These functions
are all contained within sym53c8xx.c. So why can't the linker find these
functions in the object file? (yes i tried make clean and also mrproper).
So what's up with 2.2.7-ac2 and sym53c875?? I need 2.2.7-ac for linux-raid.
(2.2.9 is broken).
Is there a solution to get the 1.3 to work with 2.2.7-ac? Or else how can i
get the 1.5 version to link in, so i can test it? The hardware is fine, so
it must be the kernel or the driver.
thanks in advance,
Paul Jakma.
