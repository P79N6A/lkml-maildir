FYI,
On my machine, the changes in 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100651447318071&w=2 or 
2.4.17-pre1 don't fix the KDE problems, as alleged. artsd still exits 
after consuming too much CPU. I've tried reducing fragment size to 512 
with no effect.
If it makes any difference to the driver, the kernel is running with 
APIC's and ACPI enabled on a uniprocessor build (Wow, acronym soup. ;)
for what it's worth, 4Front's binary driver (3.9.5, 3.9.6) has problems 
too on this machine. KDE works but there are audio pops/speedups/stops. 
(xmms, in particular, likes to stop for a while, then resume, sometimes 
after a speedup.)
