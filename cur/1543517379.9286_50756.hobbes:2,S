That implies weak ordering if in the process of optimizing (hoisting
the read before the write), the CPU creates a result different from
the case that the instructions were executed in order.  I don't think
IA32 is weakly ordered.  Our compilers would need to do a lot more
work (as for a MIPS, say).

Are you sure about that?  I think that's the issue this list is trying 
to resolve.

Not every read.  In the simplest case, it would throw away any read
that preceded a write, if it sees another write (to any memory
location) coming from another processor before it's write.  In the
best case, it would compare the address and size of the read.
Why would it do this?  To simplify the compiler writer's job.
If it didn't do this, then how do you explain this expected result,
that C so relies on so very much.
 code sequence:                         C:
             write A=0                  A = 0;
             read A (expect 0)          B = A;
             write B=A
Your comments suggest this sequence:
             read A (A=1)     <- speculative read
             write A=0
             write B=A (B=1)  <- use results of speculative read
And this isn't even MP!!
