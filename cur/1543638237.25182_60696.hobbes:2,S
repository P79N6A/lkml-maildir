After thinking about it further, there is one problem with when that is 
avoided with timeout: if the system time is changed between the timeout 
calculation and the time the kernel calculates the jiffies offset, the 
process could be delayed much longer than desired (and fixing this case 
is hard enough that it should be avoided in typical code).  Tradeoffs...
