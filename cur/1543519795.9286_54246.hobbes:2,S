} This patch is clearly wrong, since the Mac doesn't have IDE on an ISA

Shoot...there goes my career as an OS writer! :)
Yeah, the whole macide.c file is rather small. Maybe they were using the
fact that read/write b are macros which cast the address to (volitile
unsigned char/short/int *)? Dunno...anyway, the patch can go away.
