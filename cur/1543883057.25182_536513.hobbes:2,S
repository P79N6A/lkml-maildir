There's not much to be said in favour of u32, really.  Except it's shorter
and I can never remember where the underscore goes in uint_32t.
If kernel used u_int32_t globally then the world would probably be a better
place.  But using just the one name has its advantages from a consistency
POV.
box:/usr/src/linux-2.6.21> grep -r '[   \(]u32' . | wc -l

box:/usr/src/linux-2.6.21> grep -r '[   \(]uint32_t' . | wc -l 
5132
CodingStyle permits either variant, fwiw.
