Is there any particular reason that the parsers need to be in 
kernel-space. The reiser4 plugins seem like an ideal counterpart to 
FUSE. Imagine being able to automatically FUSE-mount a tar file as a 
filesystem when you cd into it. stat() need not return S_IFDIR since 
everything is a directory anyway (only normal directories need S_IFDIR, 
just like currently). When you cd into a tar file, a FUSE-fs kicks in 
and provides access to the tar file as a normal filesystem inside it - 
from userspace.

And why can meta-data not be accessed as files? To me, a lowly userspace 
developer, it seems even more inline with the UNIX way of things. bzip2 
can be in userspace while still providing data to kernel space via a 
FUSE-like interface.
