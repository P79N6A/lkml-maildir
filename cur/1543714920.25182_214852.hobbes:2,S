Not speaking about poor indentation, this is not the right solution. You
will pollute system logs with \007, and you might even send the beep far
away from the keyboard, if the console is on a serial terminal. A better
solution would be to call a function which activates the local speaker,
typically the one used to output "\007" on a vt.

please respect indentation here too, just as it is below :
