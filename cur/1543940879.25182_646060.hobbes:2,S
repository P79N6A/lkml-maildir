There is still no pointer to the mm_struct available there because pages 
of a mapping may belong to multiple processes. So we need to add another 
rmap method?
The same issue is also occurring for unmap_hugepages().

Well the GRU uses follow_page() instead of get_user_pages. Performance is 
a major issue for the GRU.

Hmmmm.. Could we go to a scheme where we do not have to increase the page 
count? Modifications of the page struct require dirtying a cache line and 
it seems that we do not need an increased page count if we have an
invalidate_range_start() that clears all the external references 
and stops the establishment of new ones and invalidate_range_end() that 
reenables new external references?
Then we do not need the frequent invalidate_page() calls.
The typical case would be anyways that invalidate_all() is called 
before anything else on exit. Invalidate_all() would remove all pages 
and disable creation of new references to the memory in the mm_struct.
