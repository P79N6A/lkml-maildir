The sharp code often had delays in it to allow voltages to stablise etc.
I still see noise issues on one of the devices. A particularly puzzling
spitz noise issue is when I make the battery reading whilst suspended
without loading the power supply line with an LED :-/. (the sharp code
didn't do this but I can find now other way to make it work).

If you register the sharpsl-pm device in the collie_pm_add() function,
ucb should always have registered by that point? As you say, you already
have the static *ucb and I'm hoping using the platform device will mean
less invasive changes in sharpsl_pm itself in the future?
For the record, this patch from Dirk Opfer also exists. He's working on
using sharpsl-pm on tosa.
