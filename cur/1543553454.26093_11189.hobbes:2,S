I actually did, and that is when all this started. I found lots of code
that does hardware register access without protecting against interrupts
or checking if the interface is up.
Tulip, eepro100 seem to be ok.
3c59x seems to be buggy
de4x5 is probably also buggy in regard to this.
It also does this:
   case DE4X5_GET_STATS:            /* Get the driver statistics */
        ioc->len = sizeof(lp->pktStats);
        spin_lock_irqsave(&lp->lock, flags);
        if (copy_to_user(ioc->data, &lp->pktStats, ioc->len)) return -EFAULT; 
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lp->lock, flags);
        break;
rrunner does GFP_KERNEL kmallocs and copy_to_user with a spin lock held. The
hardware register access is probably also racy with interrupts (not 100% sure)
depca seems to be buggy too.
... [this was just a 5 minutes grep session. I suspect most of these bugs
were also in 2.2]
Of course the window is very small because nobody really uses these interrupts
regularly.

ISDN syncppp seems to be slightly buggy (module unload race with slhc, compressor
init dubious, racy device management that could be cured by the kernel lock),
non PPP ISDN does not have a network ioctl.
