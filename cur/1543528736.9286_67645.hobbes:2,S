i've certainly seen it during development of buffer-cache/IO related
patches. b_count usage bugs trigger this debugging message so
deterministically that i believe they get fixed prior seeing any official
kernel. I'd suggest a patch like this to make the situation clearer:
-	printk("VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer\n");
+	BUG();
