The scaling is conceptually correct. There's no point to disallow an i8259
irq to happen and to mask itself on CPU0 while an IO-APIC irq is masking
itself in CPU1. They are completly orthogonal irqs.
If there's only one irq controller in the machine there's no gain and
there's one more spinlock indeed.
BTW, affinity is not relevant to the scaling in IA32 where the CPU
selection is done in hardware.
On alpha there are several types of IRQ each caming from a different
source. So now the rtc irq can run irq_desc critical section in one CPU
while another i8259-irq is masking itself in another CPU and while another
dp264-pci-irq is masking itself in yet another CPU.
So I at least conceptually like the change since the irq.c code has to be
generic.

I didn't checked the IO-APIC changes, but if that's true that's certainly
not intentional and it has to be fixed.
