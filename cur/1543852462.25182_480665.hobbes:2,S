If the /sys/block/mdX directory exists at all, it is safe to open the
device-special file.  But that is racy.  It could disappear between
checking that the dir exists, and opening the device-special-file.
I still think it would make SO much sense if /sys/block/md4/dev were a
device-special-file instead of a (silly) ascii file with 9:4.  Then
this race could be closed.  But I feel that is a battle I've never
going to win.
You could look at /sys/block/mdX/md/array_state.  If that contains
'clean' or 'inactive' then there is no point opening the device.
Otherwise there might be a point, and the race would be a lot harder
to lose.
I guess it is time for me to learn about udev config files...
