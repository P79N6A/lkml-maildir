How about:
/sbin/ip ad ad 192.168.1.1 peer 192.168.5.1 dev eth0
this gives:
# /sbin/ip ad
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue
     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
     inet 127.0.0.1/8 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host lo
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
     link/ether 00:06:5b:a2:b3:8a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
     inet 192.168.1.1 peer 192.168.5.1/32 scope global eth0
Does that do what you want?
Chris
