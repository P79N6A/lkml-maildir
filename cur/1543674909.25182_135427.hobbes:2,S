Please don't give up!
This e-mail is meant as public encouragement and big THANKS for you.
Every time I hit a bug in 2.4 and sent you a patch, it was applied after
a short time (few days). So far, 2.4 has been working perfectly for me.
There are many users and developers who are happy with the 2.4 kernel
and with you as a maintainer, they just don't say it. Something that
works is often forgotten, once it breaks or doesn't work as expected,
people start crying loudly.
Thank you for maintaining a stable tree,
Carl-Daniel
