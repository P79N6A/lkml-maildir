Yep... known issue with the sunhme driver.  AFAIK, it only affects the
HME onboard the U1E systems and no other HMEs.  The quick band-aid
work-around is at the end of this email... seems to be some weirdo
timing issue.  This patch has resolved the issue for several people with
U1E's.  (E == enterprise... UPA (for a Creator3D), wide scsi and hme
(insted of an le on the non-E models)).
