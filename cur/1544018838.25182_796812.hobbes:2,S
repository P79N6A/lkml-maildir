Mea culpa: I contributed this mess too. This worked for PA-RISC
and lacking better guidance, is what I used in 1/2 the places.

It is true for PA-RISC and some other architectures.
These architectures don't provide fake PCI devices
(emulated PCI config space) for Host-PCI Bus controllers.

I would like to keep the code consistent. Attached is a patch
for drivers/parisc. Please include with my
    Signed-off-by: Grant Grundler <grundler@parisc-linux.org>
Or if you prefer, I can repost as a separate patch.
I've compiled the iosapic/lba changes and will test those shortly.
I have no HW (by choice) to test the dino code change.
thanks,
grant
