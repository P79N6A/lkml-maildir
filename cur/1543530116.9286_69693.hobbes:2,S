The cure for that would clearly be to use a PATH statement that
appended the requisite directories on to the END of the existing
one, rather than on to the START as the previous version did, and
as you have also done. Otherwise, we lose the assurance that the
command nearest in the user's path will be used.

I have to agree there...

The problem with that lies in the fact that this is a script that
is designed to be sourced rather than run. That leaves us
vulnerable to the vagarities of the shell the user happens to be
using - if they're running bash then we're fine, but if they
happen to be running csh or tcsh then...
Basically, the ONLY way that script could really be made robust
would be to rename it as linux_ver and creat the following as
ver_linux in its place:
 Q> #!/bin/sh
 Q> \bash < linux_ver || \echo Sorry, bash shell required.
That way, we have complete control over what commands we can use,
and the instructions on how to use it remain unchanged. This also
has the advantage of completely isolating the script from the
user's environment, thus simplifying things all round.
If doing that is acceptable, then the enclosed script should be
what you're looking for. Try it out based on the above command.
I've enclosed a copy of the printout it produces on one of my
systems (the dialup server as it happens).

If we go with the above and make that script more robust, then
backstrokes are no longer applicable and things are much simpler.
What do you think?
Best wishes from Riley.
