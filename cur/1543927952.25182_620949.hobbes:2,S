No, I have no idea except for the vague talking pictures in my noggin ;)
"nicksched", maybe? Or Con's patches on the old scheduler (around 2.6.0
time, was it?)

I'm not sure what you mean by strict fairness. Obviously there are
fundamental points where you have to make some heuristic choice about
priority -- process creation/destruction, and sleep patterns in
particular. So yes, you do need decaying priority.
But if all that is applied consistently, it shouldn't be possible for
a process to get more CPU time than another of the same (or more)
demand, over a given period.

And actually it was systemically unfair by design ;) That's where
most the bad behavioural corner cases came in.

Yeah, it's OK I guess. I think it is quite complex -- you're dealing
with a complete heuristic anyway, so while the equations may look nice,
I don't actually know what justifies the equations themselves (not that
*any* scheduler can be completely justified in that way, but...). But
at least there is fairness and some rationale for it.
Nicksched had what I'd call a deterministic sleep average code too
(though much simpler). The big problem it had was that it also had
to scale timeslices back when there were high priority processes on
the runqueue in order to keep latency down while retaining O(1)
scheduling. It was hard or impossible to do exactly right. It would
have been easy with an O(lgn) data structure, though :P

I found that just doing something relatively sane (eg. a simple, fair,
decaying priority system) that doesn't violate the principle of least
surprise (ie. that unix apps and programmers have expected over the
years) has resulted in good behaviour.
I don't really know about taking credit for ideas. Probably your exact
algorithm is unique, but there is a lot of research on CPU schedulers
I have never reviewed, so I can't say. Still, if you came up with it
independently, I guess that is the main thing for one's ego ;)
Still, what I can say with at least one counterexample is that fairness
is not a new concept (curious: wasn't the 2.4 scheduler fair?).
