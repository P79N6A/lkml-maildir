The MP tables are located at 896MB of RAM.  I believe that we ended up
there because i386 Linux would choke if the tables were located higher
than 896MB (the low memory boundary).

You are correct, this patch most certainly only fixes the Unisys problem
(does that make me a corporate shill? ;).  Since we can't boot the
ES7000 without ACPI, the crash kernel must have access to the ACPI Data
area.

The MP Tables already reside in a reserved area which the kexec-tools
handles.  Unfortunately because end of ram in the user defined map is
physical 80MB, trying to reserve memory above that point breaks the
ES7000.

Andi's suggestion will work with a modification.  I'll post it once I've
tested it.
