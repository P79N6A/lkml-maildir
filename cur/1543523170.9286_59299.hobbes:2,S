Alan's diary notes that a few days ago he integrated the LMC cards into 2.2.x...
when will this make it to 2.3.x?  should I do it myself?  the extant drivers on
LMC's website don't seem to address the problem.  Do I need to contact Lanmedia
about this?
I am glad to see more WAN card drivers make it into the kernel though; linux PC's
as cheap routers can do nothing but good for the router market.
