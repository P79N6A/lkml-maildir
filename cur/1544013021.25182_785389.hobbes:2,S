 Independent of the patch in question, the problem with this seems to me that [some/many of] the kernel developers [seem to] try to get it right for 100% of all thinkable use-cases. But this fails to take into account that:
- you cannot think of every single use-case. And not only because predicting furure use-cases is difficult
- getting it right for every case very often creates complexity that leads to subtle problems tha are hard to analyse and fix
- it may waste developer ressources
- and, think about it,  do we really want  the kernel to be smarter than ourselves ? :-)
 You are right that the kernel should work out of the box most of the times. And it usually is pretty good at that. But there are corner-cases where more flexibility for the admins is desirable - if only to debug a problem without doing deep code hacking. So we should be careful adding tuning-knobs, but we should also admit that sometimes they are useful.
Happy New Year
