Hello:
I meet a problem:
I have a server which installed 4 pIII 550 Intel CPU, and 4 scsi 8G harddisks,
2G memory.
When I install RedHat5.2 with bootdisk,  it display following message and no
response any more:
in swapper task ---- not syncing
If I install RedHat6.0 with bootdisk, it can not recognize scsi disks
properly, so boot process failed. 
How to make kernel recognize the scsi disk? (or may be it is problem of
symbios).
how to resolve the problem?
Thanks in advance.
