You completly missed the point.
The part  use by the  GNU Hurd is  only the Mach microkernel,  not the
Mach operating system in a whole.

We did  it with  the agreement  of the original  authors, and  then we
changed it.   Should we call our  modified version with  the same name
than the original one ? That would be bad, indeed !

Stop lying. No one at the GNU project ever claimed a code to be his if
he didn't  write it. Just look in  any header file, and  you'll se the
copyright entries intact.  And we always say everywhere  that GNU Mach
is a fork of OSF Mach.

You're just  writing a lot  of incorrect statements,  insulting people
(yes, you're  calling the GNU  project "thieves"), and  not correcting
anything, since you just answer completly outside the subject.
