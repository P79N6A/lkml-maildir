Hi,
Here goes the third (and hopefully last) release candidate of v2.4.33.
It contains a fix for CVE-2006-2935 (locally exploitable typo in DVD
code), ethtool oopses and an ext3 block bitmap leakage issue.
Willy Tarreau has stepped up to maintain the mainline v2.4 tree, and
will do so starting from v2.4.34.
He has devoted great effort to help maintenance for the past few years.
His -hotfix tree is quite popular amongst v2.4 users, for instance.
I feel very confident in his competence for the job, knowing his good
common sense and great technical/communication skills.
Thanks Willy!
