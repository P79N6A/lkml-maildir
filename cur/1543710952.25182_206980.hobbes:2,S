This is not ok.  If you have to do something like this, I really suggest
that you not allow the "sub modules" be able to unload before the upper
module can.  In fact, why would you want to do such a thing?
I still really strongly object to this patch.  If it's a scsi problem,
fix it there, but odds are it's your driver's problem as no other scsi
driver needs this.
thanks,
