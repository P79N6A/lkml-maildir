Ketchup is a tool for updating or switching between versions of the
Linux kernel source. It can:
 - find the latest versions of numerous KernelTrees
 - calculate which patches are needed to move to that version
 - download any patches or tarballs that aren't cached
 - check GPG signatures where available
 - apply and unapply patches to get the desired result
 - call hooks like quilt push/pop before and after
The latest release can be found at:

The ketchup wiki is at:

Latest changes include:
 add support for Con Kolivas' -ck and -cks trees
 refactor downloading of alternate URLs
 use tar --strip-path/--strip-components
 add documentation for .ketchuprc files to the man page
 support "default_tree" in .ketchuprc
 read .ketchuprc from the kernel directory if it exists
 print explicitly requested information even in quiet mode.
 stop relying on LATEST-IS for finding current mainline kernel version
 general code tidying
