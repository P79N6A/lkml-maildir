Each person that contributed code to the linux kernel *CAN* have their own 
interpretations of the GPLv2 as it *APPLIES* to their code. The 
interpretation that matters when talking about the kernel, a a whole, is 
Linus'.

Wrong. If I adopt the GPL it will be because of the *interpretation* I give it 
when reading it. And because *I* am the one then granting the license, it is 
*MY* interpretation that matters.

A plain reading of the license doesn't entitle you to create a "working 
modification". See the disclaimers of warranty and guarantee - sections 11 
and 12 of the GPLv2. They mean that the person *GRANTING* the license doesn't 
have to make sure that the program will be useful for your purposes, is 
modifiable to fit your purposes or will even *NOT* damage your hardware when 
it runs. "THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS 
WITH YOU." 
In other words there is no guarantee in the GPLv2 that you will be able to 
create a working modification. The *ONLY* guarantee that exists, in regards 
to modification, is that you will be able to make a modification.

I agree that "too many intelligent people disagree". But this is just human 
nature. That people believe it says one thing when it doesn't is analogous to 
the *erroneous* belief that the world is flat.

But the "modify in place" argument is part of the reasoning behind the claim 
that the "anti-tivoization" language in GPL3 doesn't break spirit with GPL2.

But the "within reason" isn't there. That some people have inferred that term 
applies doesn't matter.

You know, I actually could agree to that "metaphysical" view.

And here is where it becomes obvious that an inference is needed. *BUT* the 
argument was that the preamble, as written, states the intent of the license. 
Having to add an unwritten phrase invalidates the argument.

This is the way it should be. However, the letter of the contract, in this 
case, is very clear and that hasn't stopped Herr Welte at all.

He doesn't. But the fact is that he has claimed that the "give you all the 
rights I have" is to be read literally. Hence Linus' above statement.

Agreed.
