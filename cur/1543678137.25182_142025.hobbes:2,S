Hm, just a guess: do you have devfs mounted to /dev
on the initial ramdisk (probably automounted by the
kernel, with config option CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y)?
Check the output of "mount", it'll show you if there's
still something mounted under the "old" root.
We use initrd + devfs for ages now (we even use romfs for
initrd like you do), and it works fine with 2.4.21 too.
