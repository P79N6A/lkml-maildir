I tried to boot 2.5.23-rmap13b on a dual PIII without success.
	Freeing unused kernel memory: 252k freed
hung here with CONFIG_SMP=y
	Adding 1052248k swap on /dev/sda6.  Priority:0 extents:1
	Adding 1052248k swap on /dev/sdb1.  Priority:0 extents:1
The above is the edited dmesg output from booting 2.5.23-rmap13b as an
UP kernel, which successfully booted on the same 2-way box.
