My filesystem has need of an extra mutex in the extended inode data area.
From what I understand, the mutex can be initalized in inode_init_once, but
I cannot determine how to free it.
It looks wrong to destroy the mutex by just destroying the slab.
It is wrong to destroy the inode in destroy_inode. Badness when
an inode is reused.
I really don't want to go back to semaphores. The mutex code just *looks* so
much cleaner.
