Thanks for pointing out that there was a sensible reason to muck with
/proc/net/snmp.  My sigh was due to the breaking of yet another program
because (a) it was forced to depend on formatted kernel data and (b) those
data were then reformatted.
If I worked up a patch to mirror these data somewhere in /proc/sys/net,
making them available via sysctl for programmers who want a stable
interface, is there a reasonable chance that it would be accepted?
(Assuming that my work is of high enough quality.)  Is there any chance
that /proc/net/snmp and /proc/net/snmp6 could be deprecated early in
2.3 with the intent of removing them for 2.4?
Please note that scripts could still get the data -- they'd just have to
look somewhere in /proc/sys/net.
