Hi Jim,
It's exacly the same problem, after about 12-24 hour everything locks up,
but I can still ping (sometimes).
But the syslog stops, and I only reboot by hardware, because the CTL+ALT+DEL
doesn't works, and the terminal either.
It's a SMP (dual pentium III) too, but after some tests with single CPU and
NOAPIC parameter to the kernel, the trouble continues.
I have no clue for what kind of tests I can do to generate the trouble, or
for what logs, or files to look for.
