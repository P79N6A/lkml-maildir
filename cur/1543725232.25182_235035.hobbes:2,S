I have a P4C800-E (DLX) as well, but it is working fine.
The big differences I see is:
1) You have the 3Com network device where I have the E1000
   (I thought all P4C800-E have E1000, where the smaller ones,
    P4C800, P4C800-DLX have 3Com ??)
2) I use Interrupt Vectors, where you seem not to?
I am on bios 1016 (latest stable for P4C800-E DLX, while I
see there is a 1017 beta 002).
Not sure if you want my .config to compare?
Cheers,
