Hi,
I have brought this issue once already in 2.5.70 context (see uppermost
post in http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=105410790500005&r=1&w=2), but it
apparently slipped through. So I've decided to bring it up again, this
time describing [hopefully] better how does this *generic* problem with
ide-cd.c manifests itself. In the nutshell the problem is that [as it is
now] every failed SG_IO request is replayed second time without data
transfer. E.g. if WRITE(10) SCSI command fails with sense code X, ide-cd
immediately resends the command block descriptor one more time, this time
without programming for any associated I/O payload, which [normally]
results in *different* sense code. And the catch is that user-land gets
this second sense code instead of the real/original one. Suggested patch
overcomes this problem by immediately purging the failed SG_IO request
from the request queue.
P.S. Non-essential "rant." One can wonder how come the originally
discussed patch, the one which made to 2.5.71, was sufficient for DVD+RW
units, but not DVD-RW. Are commands sent to DVD-RW unit so to say bound
to fail? In a sense yes! Majority of DVD-RW units terminate WRITE
requests  with "LONG WRITE IN PROGRESS" sense code wherever internal
buffer gets full. The idea behind this LUN behaviour is to minimize
IDE-bus monopolization periods. The sense code is commonly treated as
"estimate how long does it take to purge say 1/2 of internal buffer,
hibernate for that while and retry the failed WRITE command." Needless
to say that if original sense code is effectively discarded and replaced
by another code [apparently by "INVALID ADDRESS FOR WRITE"], it makes it
impossible to treat this essentially *non-error* condition appropriately
For whatever reason DVD+RW units don't terminate WRITE requests in same
manner and IDE-bus remains monopilized till there is buffer space
available to meet the outstanding WRITE request. Well, there're commands
which get replayed even in DVD+RW case, those are data-less commands,
most notably TEST UNIT READY, which are "safe" to replay.
Cheers. A.
