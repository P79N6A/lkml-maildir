The current behaviour seems better from a theoretical point of view.  All
we want to know is the reference pattern - whether it is one process
referencing the page frequently or 100 processes referencing it
infrequently shouldn't matter.  And if we want to give mapped pages more
preference over unmapped ones (they already have some preference, by the
default value of /proc/sys/vm/swappiness), we have less radical ways of
doing this.
But yes, it probably makes damn-all difference across a mix of workloads.
