Bug in mmap_kmem(), drivers/char/mem.c.
When mapping the kmem, page alingning seems to mess the address:
  unsigned long long val;
  val = (u64)vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
  vma->vm_pgoff = ((unsigned long)val >> PAGE_SHIFT) - PAGE_OFFSET;
  vma->vm_pgoff = __pa(val) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
Subtracting 0xc0000000 and shifting is made in wrong order.
Kernel: 2.6.12.3, 2.6.12.4
