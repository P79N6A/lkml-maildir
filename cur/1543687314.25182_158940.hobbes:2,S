Looks good. There are some ACPI bits to clean up after, but with the
preliminary ACPI workarounds and the cyclone timer one-liner, 16x/64GB
x440's come up and run userspace just fine with XKVA enabled (haven't
bothered with NUMA-Q since the setup there is inconvenient for others).
I think it was all wrapped up by the combination of the pmd and TSS
fixes (at least to get these boxen going).
