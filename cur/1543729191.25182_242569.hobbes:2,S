OK, this would certainly be an improvement, I was using the driver from
-mm until 2.6.8.1 anyway due to that damn rhine_power_init bug, with no
problems whatsoever.
What do you think of Ingo's solution of trying to move the problematic
call to mdio_read out of the spinlocked section?  It does seem that the
slowness of mdio_read causes the rp->lock spinlock to be held for an
awfully long time.  In a live audio setting you would actually get lots
of media events.
