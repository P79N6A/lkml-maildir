Hi All.
Sorry for the breach of netiquette - I'm not subscribed to the list
(please CC: me on anything important!), but I'm not really up to much a s
a kernel contributor...
Anyway - here's the reason for my posting. I've got a kernel driver for
the RTL2831U device (a DVB-T device) from Realtek. Just this morning, I
got an email from them agreeing to release it under GPL.
It currently has no copright notices at all - I think I should add Realtek
attributions to it.
Then what should I do?
Vic.
