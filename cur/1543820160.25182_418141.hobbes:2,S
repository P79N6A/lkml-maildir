I wrote a little hack that detects up to 1000 callers of kfree(NULL) and
outputs what it finds with sysrq-l.

It found right away, two function in transaction.c from the jbd code,
that were freeing an object that sometimes gets allocated.  Andrew
Morton already submitted the patch in the -mm tree to fix it:
-       kfree(new_transaction);
+       if (unlikely(new_transaction))          /* It's usually NULL */
+               kfree(new_transaction);
        return ret;
 }
 
@@ -724,7 +725,8 @@ done:
        journal_cancel_revoke(handle, jh);
 
 out:
-       kfree(frozen_buffer);
+       if (unlikely(frozen_buffer))    /* It's usually NULL */
+               kfree(frozen_buffer);
Where he uses unlikely and nicely documents that it is usually NULL (of
course the "unlikely" sort of says that already ;)
I've been running this patched kernel for a couple of days on a mostly
idle machine, (I don't need it right now, so I just let it run) and it
has shown some more problem areas.  probably occurred when updatedb
kicked off.
Here's the dump:

start_this_handle and do_get_write_access have already been fixed, but
now it's looking like journal_get_undo_access and ext3_clear_inode are
problem children too.
