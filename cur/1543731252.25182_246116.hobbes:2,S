I think there are some other people, like regular gnomemeeting users 
judging from that mailing list, that would have some interest in forming a 
team of sorts to maintain the driver. At least, I am, for myself, if 
nobody else is interested. Perhaps some other webcam driver developers 
want to help out a bit, too. Many people use this driver. I'm also willing 
to write a simple patch script that would install the (out-of-tree) driver 
in a kernel tree without requiring too much user knowledge or 
intervention, if Nemosoft would decide to release his last code.
But let's give it a few days of rest and find out what Nemosoft thinks.
