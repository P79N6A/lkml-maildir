Unluckly we don't have any flexibility. The segment index (pmd) has 11
bits,
pointers are 8 byte. That makes 16K segment table. I have understood that
this is a problem if the system is really low on memory. But low on memory
does mean low on real memory + swap space, doesn't it ? The system has
enough swap space but it isn't using any of it when the BUG hits. I think
the "if (!order)" statements before the "goto try_again" in __alloc_pages
have something to do with it. To test this assumption I removed the ifs and
I didn't see any "__alloc_pages: %lu-order allocation failed." message
before I hit yet another BUG in swap_state.c:60.
Whats the reasoning behind these ifs ?
