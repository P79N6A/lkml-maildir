hi,
i just realized that i'm doing something that has a high likelihood to
be the cause of my problems. i'm guessing that other 64-bit users
aren't setting byte locks above 0x7FFFFFFF. upon perusal of
fs/locks.c, i noticed that OFFSET_MAX is 0x7FFFFFFF no matter what the
architecture. as a result, it's possible to create a byte lock that
starts at 0x80000000 and ends at 0x7FFFFFFF. much unhappiness results.
anyways, i've attached the trivial fix at the end.
