Subject: BIOS implementors disabling the LAPIC

I have several systems here where Linux tells me:
Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- you can enable it with "lapic"
As far as I understand, the Local APIC was integrated directly to the 
CPU 12-15 years ago. Why would a BIOS implementor choose to disable it?
(And what does it mean to "disable" the LAPIC?)
Note: the motherboard does not provide an IO-APIC.
I've ask the kernel to re-enable the LAPIC, and was able to use OProfile 
in hardware counter mode, i.e. it seems to work fine.
Regards.
