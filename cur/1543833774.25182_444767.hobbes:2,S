I never trust a single hard drive with data that cannot be instantly 
re-generated anyway (eg squid caches). The fact that some people have 
hardware errors should not require every single fs to accommodate random 
bad-sectors. Feel free to use ext3 or other fs which handles this 
situation (and other situations) better, but reiserfs works fine on good 
hardware. It has been my root filesystem on many systems with no 
problems whatsoever, even with cheap SATA drives.

I read the archives, and most of the problems pointed out during the 
review were fixed relatively quickly, followed by a flame war due to 
some suggesting that reiser4 should not be able to affect VFS semantics, 
and other such matters (which IMO should be outside of the scope of a 
code review). There has been no follow-up review as far as I can tell. 
The discussion quickly degenerated into a personality argument against 
Mr Reiser, with several developers taking a strong position against 
reiser4 (the exact reasons for which are not specified).
I don't quite know where reiser4 stands at the moment, given that it is 
in -mm and has been for a very long time. I also looked at the patch 
again, and it is indeed quite well isolated from the rest of the kernel 
so I don't understand why it is not being merged as an EXPERIMENTAL option.
Regardless, it is available in -mm for anyone to use, and last I 
checked, works incredibly well leaving other filesystems miles behind in 
terms of speed. I haven't tested it enough to comment on the 
reliability, but if it is as reliable as reiserfs, it is sufficient for 
me and many others who use RAID and a UPS.
