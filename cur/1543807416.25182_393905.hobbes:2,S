Dear maintainers,
Is there any work in Linux undergoing to separate Linux drivers and the 
the main kernel, and manage drivers using a package management system 
that only manages kernel drivers and modules? If this can be done, the 
kernel maintenance can be simple, and will end-up with a more stable 
(less frequent changed) kernel API for drivers, also make every 
developers of drivers happy.
Would like to see that happens .
regards,
David Chow
