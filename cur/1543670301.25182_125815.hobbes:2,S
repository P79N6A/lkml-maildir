Yes, both evidence and in some cases explanation. As to the reasons
quoted in the original message those are probably less true now. Linux
has extremely optimised memory copiers - our AMD memory copiers broke
older VIA chipsets, it took several months until photoshop and other
specialist apps hit the same bug with their mmx/3dnow hand tuned effects
tools on windows and VIA actually fixed it.
Linux also allocates memory in very different patterns to Windows. So
a box that shows the odd crash in windows due to a memory error may show
repeated crashes in Linux an vice versa
