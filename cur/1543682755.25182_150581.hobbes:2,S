What about the keyboard being built in. People will still not set that. 
The proper solution would be to alter the build system on a default build 
to scan the .config file for CONFIG_PC_KEYB, CONFIG_MOUSE, CONFIG_BUSMOUSE,
CONFIG_PSMOUSE etc. Then convert them to what is needed for 2.6.X. The same 
for framebuffer console stuff. We can scan for CONFIG_FB and if 
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE is not present set it. We only would need to do 
this for a default build.
