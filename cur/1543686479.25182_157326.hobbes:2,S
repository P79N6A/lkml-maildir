It's mainly a packaging issue. So far, it seems that nobody has
written a useful set of generic tools to build an initrd. But
the ingredients are there.

A solution that depends on GRUB and that only works for
modules ? That's not so nice. What if a driver also needs some
setup script, a user-space demon, or has to download a non-GPL
firmware binary ?
If you envision a use where someone would load a set of drivers
from removable media to bring up the system, it would be more
flexible to allow for multiple initrds/initramfs, which then
contain whatever code or data is needed.
And please don't stop there, but also specify what these
additional file systems should contain (e.g. a script
"initializeme" in the top-level directory, or such).

So we're just hallucinating all those binary-only drivers ? :-)

A developer's dream - the immutable standard kernel with
internal data structures frozen for all eternity ;-))

Once kexec makes into the mainstream kernel, I'm sure we won't
have to wait long for such things to show up.

That's entirely a user-space issue.
