Subject: bogus VIA IRQ fixup in drivers/pci/quirks.c

Why is the irq changed from 24 to 0, and why does uhci use irq 24
anyway? I dont have the /proc/interrupts output from this box, maybe no
interrupt is handled for the controller? None of the attached usb
devices is recognized with 2.6.13.
0000:00:0e.0 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxx UHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev 04) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
       Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID) USB Controller
       Flags: bus master, stepping, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 24
       I/O ports at f2010040 [size=32]
The Mac has a Bandit PCI host bridge and a Grand Central I/O controller.
Here is the boot.msg stuff about the card:
