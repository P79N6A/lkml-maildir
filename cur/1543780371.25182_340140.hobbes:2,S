I am more worried about timer latencies and its effects. Because of this skew 
between when jiffy interrupt was originally supposed to happen and when it 
will now happen, it can lead to, for example, scheduling latencies upto
1 jiffy (for HZ=100, that could hurt some apps?) Not to mention that
this will not play well with high-res-timers, but that is probably
not a concern now!
