Version 2.6.6 of perfctr, the Linux performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Version 2.6.6, 2004-02-21
- Pentium-M has an undocumented local APIC quirk which can stop
  perfctr interrupt delivery. Added workaround to prevent this.
- Fixed a bug in x86-64's perfctr interrupt entry code in 2.4 kernels.
  Luckily, the bug turned out to be harmless (a bogus "rip" value was
  retrieved, but never used by the higher-level interrupt handler).
- Added support for Pentium 4 Model 3 processors, which have slight
  event set changes from earlier models.
- Updated kernel support: 2.6.3, 2.4.25, 2.4.22-1.2174.nptl (FC1),
  2.4.20-30.9 (RH9), and 2.4.21-193 (SuSE). Removed support for some
  obsolete FC1 and RH update kernels.
