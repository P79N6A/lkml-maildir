Sorry, I just don't buy that one.  This was a 2-second sampling interval in top.
top(1) is a program that has to work, so if this scheduler breaks it like this,
then we need to understand and fix top(1) or the scheduler.

This was HZ=1000, with NO_HZ.  And, no, not normally different nice levels.
Here I was just trying to keep the machine usable while building a couple of things.
Keep at it.  Someday this might be good enough for mainline,
but right now the stock scheduler beats it for my desktop (notebook) loads.
Cheers
