Very.  kvm pins pages that are referenced by the guest; a 64-bit guest 
will easily pin its entire memory with the kernel map.  So this is 
critical for guest swapping to actually work.
Other nice features like page migration are also enabled by this patch.

Any sufficiently difficult bug is indistinguishable from a feature.
