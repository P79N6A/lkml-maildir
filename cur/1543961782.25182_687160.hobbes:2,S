Suffice to say that the number of large subsystems that actually run 
Sparse before each and every pull request is extremely low - this simply 
matches the practical difficulties involved.
You are suggesting ad-hoc solutions without having tried it all 
yourself. And i'd very much agree with doing an upstream kernel Sparse 
sweep shortly before the final release. Do you volunteer for that?
We for one simply concentrate on the the things that we think makes it 
more likely to find bugs. For example we build and boot x86.git with 
many different configs before every pull request. In practice that 
catches far more tester-critical bugs than Sparse - and we know that 
simply from the fact because we use both methods and have a good 
comparison of the results. We also work on automating Sparse checks in 
the future but as i said it, it's not easy.
