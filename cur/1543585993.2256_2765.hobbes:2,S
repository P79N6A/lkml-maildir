Or write a kernel input device driver. In fact I probable have a mouse
driver for you. What kind of mouse do you have? Then set your X config to
have the following:
Section "Pointer"
            Protocol    "ImPS/2"
            Device      "/dev/input/mice"
            ZAxisMapping 4 5
EndSection
This way you don't have to wait a few months before the bug is fixed by
XFree86.
MS: (n) 1. A debilitating and surprisingly widespread affliction that
renders the sufferer barely able to perform the simplest task. 2. A disease.
