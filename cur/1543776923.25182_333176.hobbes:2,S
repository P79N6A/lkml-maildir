Actually, it's now pretty much confirmed that this ISN'T a stack overflow, not 
just because of what you've said (now and before), but also because I've 
tried an 8K stacks kernel and, sadly, there's no stand-out stack abusers.
It's annoying that this is so readily reproducible here, yet almost impossible 
to debug, and clearly a sideaffect of 4KSTACKS.. without it actually being a 
stack overflow.
I realise 4KSTACKS is a considerable rework of the IRQ handler, etc. and 
probably even more heavily modified by rt-preempt, but is there nothing else 
that can be tested before a serial console run?
