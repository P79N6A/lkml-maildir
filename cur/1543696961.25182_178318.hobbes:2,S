Yes, that is pretty special, isn't it. :)

... and sys_restart_syscall().  If your statement was true, why was it
so important to reset restart_block.fn when we deliver a signal?
Seems to me that we can get into a situation where we are in a signal
handler, and the interrupted state has (1) eip/nip pointing at a
system call instruction and (2) the syscall number register (eax/r0)
containing __NR_restart_syscall.  Now, if we get into this state we
will initially have restart_block.fn == do_no_restart_syscall.  But
that can get changed by the signal handler.
Now, when we resume that context we will call sys_restart_syscall
which will call restart_block.fn.  Which won't necessarily still point
to do_no_restart_syscall.  So I still think we have a problem.
Paul.
