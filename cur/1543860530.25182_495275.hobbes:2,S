There are still a couple outstanding issues which need to be resolved
before this is ready for inclusion in the mainline kernel.
The main one is support for CONFIG_STACK_GROWSUP, which I think is
just parisc.  I've been meaning to look into this for a while, but I
was out of commision for most of November so it got punted to the back
burner.  I'll try to revisit it soonish.  If someone from the
parisc-linux list wants to take a look, though, that's fine by me.
The other is support for the various executable formats.  I've tested
elf and script pretty thoroughly, but I'm not sure how to go about
testing most of the others -- does anyone use aout anymore?  Maybe the
solution is just to check it in and wait to see if someone complains.
