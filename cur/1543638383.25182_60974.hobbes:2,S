_this_ is the lba. 160086527.  It is the very last sector on the disk.
block_read_full_page() has issued a read request for the 4k block
at index 20010815, which is LBA 160086520.  So the device driver
is being asked to read exactly the final eight blocks on the device.
The partitioning code seems to be OK.  There seems to be a problem
reading end-of-disk.
