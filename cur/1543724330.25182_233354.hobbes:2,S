Hi Nick:)
	 I've been busy benchmarking Con's autoregulation which _is_ proved
interesting in middle pressure.
AFAICS mm7np works that way : it cleans up memory brightly so we do see
attractive free memory available _but_ relevant rss doesn't move 1 byte
:( So we'll have foregrounding elevation for sure (no cleaning required)
but application still have to 'emerge' and that's the heavier side of
the story I'm afraid.

FabF
