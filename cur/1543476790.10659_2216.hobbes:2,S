This is weird. You have bigger sys time than real time. How can that
be? Do you have a SMP machine. Does 'time' work that way on SMP
machines?
Also, improvement is so small (if I got it right) that I wouldn't
bother. Benchmarking is a whole science. If I get such a small
improvements in my tests, I regularly dump the idea I had. :)
