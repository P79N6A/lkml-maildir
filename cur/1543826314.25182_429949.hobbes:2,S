I've never had technical objections to merging this, just AFAIK it had a
highly questionable origin, namely being reverse-engineered in a
non-clean-room environment that might leave Linux legally vulnerable.
If we can clear that hurdle, by all means pass it on to John Linville
and get it moving towards upstream.
