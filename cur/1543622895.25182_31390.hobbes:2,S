I would say that is a fair question. I find it in the production kernel?
Good, so it was considered ready by someone. Seems to me one of the Redhat
kernels had devfs as a module, they seem to think so.
It's a good question, though, and I am assuming that the answer is "it's
in the stable kernel" which isn't yes or no.
If it's not stable then there simply is no Linux solution to large
storage. Given what vendors are doing I find that unintuitive.
