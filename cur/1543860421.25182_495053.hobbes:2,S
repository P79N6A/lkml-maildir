This patch breaks several platforms. If you're going to add parameters
to a function like backlight_device_register, you could at least grep
the tree and update all the users :-(.
To top it off, someone noticed some of the failures and fixed them but
nobody thought to fix the drivers in drivers/video/backlight itself and
a mac reference seems to have escaped too.
I'll send a patch to to Andrew to clean up this mess...
