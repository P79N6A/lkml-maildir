Ok, that makes sense -- if NFSv2 has no fsync(), then using "async" mode
definitely sounds broken.  But is this the same with NFSv3?

I'm of the (probably small) school of thought where I'd rather have my
data disappear than have to wait for all of the stupid uses of sync() and
fsync() in applications everywhere these days.  In fact, I've even
considered writing an SMTP gateway which attempts delivery to the remote
host between the end-of-message marker and the response in order to avoid
having to fsync() to a queue (and still RFC compliant :) ).
Instead, I think applications should be woken up so that they can exit or
reply "OK" once the dirty data has been flushed, overwritten, or toasted
rather than the application requesting it and blocking).  The same sort
of idea, but the other way around.  Maybe fsync() could just change more
to a "I'd like to participate in the next round of writes" kind of call.

Well, if the client sends immediately _and_ the server writes it
instantly to disk, then, yes, that would not be optimal.
NFS should just extend fsync() back to the server -- with minimal caching
on the client, normal write-back caching on the server, and where fsync()
on the client forces the server to write before returning on the client. 
Forcing this to happen on close() doesn't even line up with local file
systems.
