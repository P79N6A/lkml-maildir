Thanks Alan!
In fact, I tested mem=384M and it seems to _not_ crash. So, I assume that it
works.

How would one know if the BIOS uses the upper MB of memory? I poked around
in the BIOS and most of the "shadow" and "cacheable" things are disabled.
Also, is there someone maintaining a list of such known bugs for
CPU+motherboard combo? If there is no-one, I'll be happy to maintain the
list.
Thanks again,
-Sudhi.
