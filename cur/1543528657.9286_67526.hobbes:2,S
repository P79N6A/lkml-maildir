Hello!

Yes, they are SMP friendly unlike BHs at least.

It is not so essential. Softirqs have no priority,
so that these two statements are essentially equivalent,
when schedule is initated from an hard irq or from process context.
But! There exist side effect when schedule is made from another softirq.
(f.e. from timer). Order becomes important in this case: essentially,
tasklet_schedule() and tasklet_hi_schedule() form two "pipes":
events scheduled from one pipe to another tend to be scheduled more
reactively. F.e. events rescheduled from timer should use tasklet_schedule().
