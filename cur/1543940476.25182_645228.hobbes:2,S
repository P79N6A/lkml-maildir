actually James bidi tree has a fix for this in the scsi_data_buffer patch.
what you sent is not enough there are other places. look at this patch I
sent to the list.
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg21938.html
Could we take the 2 SG patches and submit them through the scsi
bidi tree? It is much more natural to have them in one tree as one
patchset then try coordinate with git-merge. Actually if you look at it,
the biggest change is to SCSI. So I think it is more natural this way
