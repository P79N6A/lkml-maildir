| Well NEC PC9800 serires were stopped to manufacture a few years

Well, it's just not usable at all in its current from in the
maintained Linux tree, so if it's used by someone, it requires
lots of other patches (approx. 136 KB patch), which should be
submitted for review/evaluation and possible merging.
It needs to be fixed and maintained (which is not a one-time thing,
but a continuing job), or it should go away, and people who might
use it can use an even larger out-of-kernel-tree patch.
