Hi,
  I'm in the process of trying to track down a problem with the sparc32 port
not booting and believe that the problem lies somewhere in either the scheduling
algorithm or ksoftirqd. Schedule is called by spawn_ksoftirqd, which then proceeds
to loop infinately. I know that, eventually, prev = current = next = ksoftirqd.
current->need_resched gets set to 0 in the move_rr_back block of schedule(),
but at some point in recalculate: it gets set back to 1.
Is there any sort of documentation on the softirq stuff and the scheduling algorithm
out there that is relevant to 2.4.9? It seems that the only stuff I've managed
to find is based off the 2.2.x kernels.
Thanks,
Jonathan Zimmerman
