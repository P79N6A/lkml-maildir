Both the sg driver and the aha152x driver changed in the
2.2.5 to 2.2.6 transition. Rolling back the aha152x driver
to [kernel_2.2.5]/drivers/scsi/aha152x.[hc] has been
reported to work for others with this
cdrecord/sg/aha152x problem.
There are new patches on the aha152x driver in the 
2.2.10-ac12 kernel so perhaps you could roll forward
to those. If you need more help, contact me.
