	If you don't want to block until an operation completes, then don't ask to!

	That is not quite correct. That is a good approximate definition of
'select's behavior, but it is not exact. As for your assertion that a
noblocking read/write wouldn't block, that's not necessarily true. Remember,
the 'close' may not have taken affect yet, since the descriptor is still in
use by virtue of being selected on.

	Perfect. Doing this is absolutely, positively wrong and the more you are
punished for it, the better. It's as wrong as calling 'free' on a chunk of
memory when another thread may be usign it. It is impossible to make this
work safely, as another thread could open a socket or file and get the same
descriptor write before the call to 'read' is entered. There's no possible
way to do this because there is no 'unlock a mutex and read' operation.

	Why? That's a great design and it's absolutely essential in many cases.
Suppose, for example, I have two descriptors I want to write to. If I assign
one thread to each socket permanently, then I'm 100% guaranteed a context
switch every time I change which socket I'm writing to, so if there's lots
of small bits of data going out both of them, my performance will suck. But
if I assign one thread to both socket descriptors, I'm guaranteed that one
connection will stall if the the application-level send queue for the other
has been swapped out to disk. Not distributing network I/O across threads
dynamically is a recipe for either low performance or bursty performance.
