Did you configure the machines on the dialup network in any special
way? They need to know that packets for the machines not on your
dialup network need to go to your router.
If these are all Linux/Unix boxes, you can make appropriate route
table entries on every machine or maybe use a routing daemon.
Otherwise you need proxy ARP on your home network router too. You need
a proxy ARP entry for every IP that's on the other side of the router.
That would make ~250 entries, but you can combine lots of them using
the netmask option.
I once did such a thing for 9 IPs in a class B network. (Took ~18
proxy ARP entries). It worked fine but now we've switched to
masquerading.
