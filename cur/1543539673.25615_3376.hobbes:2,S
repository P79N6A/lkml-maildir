hi !
2.4.0-test4 worked fine for me....
now i've installed test5 (pre3, pre4)
i have a lot of problems with modules:
for example "insmod hisax"
gives out:
unresolved symbol register_isdn_Rd52c6bbe
unresolved symbol irq_stat
unresolved symbol __generic_copy_to_user
many other modules fail to load with a lot of unresolved symbols
please help me....
insmod -V -> 2.3.12
gcc 2.1.3
everything else is up to date.... (like described in Changes)
thanx.
