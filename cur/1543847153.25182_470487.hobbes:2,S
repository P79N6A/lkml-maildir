How does it hurt us?
int pcibios_prep_mwi(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
        /* We set correct PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE register values for every
         * device probed on this platform.  So there is nothing to check
         * and this always succeeds.
         */
        return 0;
}
If Dave's wrong about that, it hurts him, not us ;-)
It's still not necessary for the Tulip driver to check.
