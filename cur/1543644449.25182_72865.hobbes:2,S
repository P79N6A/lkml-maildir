OK, I think we've agreed on most of the issues already. Just a couple of
details:

OK, will do. Need to add a syscall for controlling tracing though (currently
done through device ioctl()).

Regarding callbacks:

We record the filename only once (i.e. upon exec or open). After that,
the fd is used.

Sure, for performance measurements it's the admin, but per my earlier
descriptions:
- users who want to debug synchronization problems of their own tasks
shouldn't see the kernel's behavior.
- users who want to log custom events separate from the kernel events
don't want to see the kernel's beavhior.
In any case, what the admin sees and what the users see of the tracing
facility will certainly be different (i.e. not the same level of
flexibility).

OK, we'll revisit this issue.
