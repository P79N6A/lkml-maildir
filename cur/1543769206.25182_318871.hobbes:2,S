> Do you have any funky netfilter/iptables modules loaded?
I use a iptables based firewall, but no additional netfilter modules
are loaded. The network configuration is as it is shipped by SuSE
(i.e. no CONFIG_IP_NF_* modules, but most of the "Networking options"
are set to y).
And as I told in an earlier mail, I had scheduling built in
the kernel (CONFIG_NET_SCHED=y, CONFIG_NET_QOS=y, 
CONFIG_NET_ESTIMATOR=y, CONFIG_NET_CLS=y, CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE=y).
I have disabled NET_SCHED now (as Marcelo suggested), and I got no 
overflows since then (4 days uptime).
Seems to work so far.
Thanks and regards,
Manfred
