The points are:
a) you have to thread the entire kernel, every data structure which is a
   problem.  Scheduler, networking, device drivers, everything.  That's
   thousands of locks and uncountable bugs, not to mention the impact on
   uniprocessor performance.
b) I have to thread a file system.
So I'm not saying that I'll thread less in the file system (actually I am,
but let's skip that for now and assume I have to do everything you have
to do).  All I'm saying is that I don't have to worry about the rest of
the kernel which is a huge savings.
You tell me - which is easier, multithreading the networking stack to 
64 way SMP or running 64 distinct networking stacks?
