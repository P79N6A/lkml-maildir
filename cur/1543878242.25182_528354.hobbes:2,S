it looks good to me - and once i get a non-whitespace-damaged patch i'll 
put it into -rt so we'll have testing. (this patch should have at most a 
latency impact, if we forget to preempt somewhere, and -rt users are 
quite touchy about latencies.)

yes, that's my thinking too at the moment. I'd also like to see a 
summary of 'open design questions' list from Mike (if Mike has 
time/energy for that?) - many questions were raised, a good number of 
them were answered, various changes done to SD but there's no good 
summary of the current state of affairs.
