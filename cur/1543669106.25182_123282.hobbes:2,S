I know, but creating a new dir entry and linking to an existing dir entry 
is not always the same, e.g. filesystems, where a dir entry is not simply 
a pointer to an inode table, have to update other entries as well to 
create a new link. So far filesystems could assume that source dentry was 
a valid dir entry, this patch changes this.
