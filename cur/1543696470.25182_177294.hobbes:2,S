Sure, but do it in a way that's friendly to
all the apps and admins that only know "nice".
nice_cpu   sets CPU niceness
nice_net   sets net niceness
nice_disk  sets disk niceness
...
nice       sets all niceness values at once

Keeping IO niceness as similar to CPU niceness as
you can would be very good for admins.
