    I have many users asking for something like this.  Peter's approach is
simple and it appears to solve the problem for many situations.
    With that in mind though, for a more complicated but higher performing
approach please take a look at the User Level Interrupt (ULI) project at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/uli/.
  It requires some per-arch assembly but
with some recent changes we're seeing ~1.5us latency from hardware event to
user space function start.  I'm hoping to add an IA32 port out soon.
