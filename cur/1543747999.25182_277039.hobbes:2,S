The thing is that -mm changes so fast that a bug reported can be solved
an hour later, leaving a stale bug report for a few days (or years).
Whoever wants to pick up the bug quite much has to mail either the
bug-submitter asking if the bug has been resolved, mail the maintainer
of whatever area the bug concerns or mail akpm. 
This leads me to thinking that bugzilla doesn't serve any functionality
for at least -mm.
