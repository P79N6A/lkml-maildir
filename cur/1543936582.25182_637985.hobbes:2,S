i'm aware of this (i bang on embedded no-mmu systems).  if his banner
string was crazy long, i'd more understand, but it isnt any longer
than any one of his error strings in the probe function.  in fact, all
of the error strings combined are more than 3x the size of his banner.
wonder if we could design a printk designed for __init functions to
address this in a clean fashion.
#define init_printk(fmt, __VA_ARGS__) \
  do { \
    static const __init char __fmt[] = fmt; \
    printk(__fmt , ## __VA_ARGS__); \
  } while (0)
(yes, i know this isnt perfect as you'd need to pass back the return
value of printk(), but it's an idea)

there is no hard requirement anywhere that says platform resources
must be in the board resources file.  marking the functions as __init
instead of __devinit will basically cause a kernel crash if someone
tries to use dynamic platform resources.  there is no option that i'm
aware of that prevents dynamic platform resources which means there is
no way for the driver to say "i wont work with standard dynamic
platform resources".
