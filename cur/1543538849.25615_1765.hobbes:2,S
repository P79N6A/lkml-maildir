    I have been told by multiple software venders (and from sun) that

    SMP box gains you very little performance. I tend to believe this
    as these are the folks who would be selling the more expensive
    SMP box if it was better :-)
I don't know if this is true -- but under high network load, Solaris
(2.6) does appear to perform better than Linux 2.2.x last time I
looked into this.
