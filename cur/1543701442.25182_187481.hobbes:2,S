Linux isn't a closed-source system where binary APIs are frozen, so 
working best with a set of specific kernels (and I don't even say kernel 
versions, I *mean* kernels, just search for threads on nvidia with 
kernels built with some perfectly legit gcc flags) doesn't mean it is 
working best with Linux.
What if Nvidia goes bankrupt in the future like 3DFX did, what do you do 
with your card ? throw it away ?
I type this e-mail on a Sony PCG-GRT785B laptop which happen to use a 
Geforce Go 420 chip. Until the 5328 nvidia driver, I couldn't even 
switch to a text console after starting X (search for this type of 
problems and you'll see that the laptop support is really lacking in 
their drivers). Even now software suspend is out of the question when 
the nvidia kernel module is loaded (even with X stopped). I was aware of 
the fact that I could encounter these problems when I purchased the 
laptop and was ready to use the OSS XFree driver without 3D support 
(unfortunately I found out that the ones shipped with RH9 don't work), 
so I assume them, but it's hardly what I'll call "working best"...
There's nothing political in saying that binary drivers don't work best. 
In fact it assumes a minimum understanding of the technical aspects 
involved in a Linux kernel to understand *why* they can't work best...
