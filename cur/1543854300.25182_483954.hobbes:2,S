    Don't ask me, ask the genirq authors. :-)

    I'm not sure it's feasible. The idea behind level/edge flows is to 
eliminate the interrupt priority I think. That's why they EOI ASAP (with the 
level handler masking IRQ before that) -- this way the other interrupts may 
come thru.
    I used to think that fasteoi was intended for SMP PICs which are 
intelligent enough to mask off the interrupts pending delivery or handling on 
CPUs and unmask them upon receiving EOI -- just like x86 IOAPIC does. This 
way, the acceptance of the lower priority interrupts shouldn't be hindered on 
the other CPUs. Maybe the scheme is different for OpenPIC (I know it has the 
different interrupt distribution scheme from IOAPIC)?
