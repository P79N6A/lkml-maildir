Hi,
2.4.25 contains several security related fixes, including a fix for
another sys_mremap vulnerability. Upgrade to 2.4.25 for those who use
mainline kernels is recommended.
For those using distribution v2.4 kernels, the respective vendors should
release kernel updates soon.
For those using 2.6, upgrade to 2.6.3 is recommended.
More details about the issue will be available soon (if not already) by
complete security advisory by Paul Starzetz/CERT.
