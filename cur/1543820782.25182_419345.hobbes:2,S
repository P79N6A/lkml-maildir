The second example is simply incorrect, because the operator new throws an 
exception when we run out of memory, instead of returning a null pointer.
So it has to be written as:
sbi = new SuperBlock;
/* The rest of code assumes that the sbi pointer is valid. If this was not the 
case, let's hope that the caller caught std::bad_alloc properly */
