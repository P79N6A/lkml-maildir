Subject: [patch 0/8] fault-injection capabilities (v3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Changes from last version
- add stacktrace filter
- drop process-filter from boot-time setup
- build fixes from Don Mullis
- add documentation and some scripts
---
This patch set provides some fault-injection capabilities.
- kmalloc() failures
- alloc_pages() failures
- disk IO errors
We can see what really happens if those failures happen.
In order to enable these fault-injection capabilities:
1. Enable relevant config options (CONFIG_FAILSLAB, CONFIG_PAGE_ALLOC,
   CONFIG_MAKE_REQUEST) and runtime configuration kernel module
   (CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUGFS)
2. build and boot with this kernel
3. modprobe fault-inject-debugfs
4. configure fault-injection capabilities behavior by debugfs
For example about kmalloc failures:
/debug/failslab/probability
	specifies how often it should fail in percent.
/debug/failslab/interval
	specifies the interval of failures.
/debug/failslab/times
	specifies how many times failures may happen at most.
/debug/failslab/space
	specifies the size of free space where memory can be allocated
	safely in bytes.
/debug/failslab/process-filter
	specifies whether process filter is enabled or not.
	it allows failing only permitted processes by /proc/<pid>/make-it-fail
/debug/failslab/stacktrace-depth
	specifies the maximum stacktrace depth walking allowed.
	a value '0' means stacktrace filter is disabled.
/debug/failslab/address-start
/debug/failslab/address-end
	specifies the range of virtual address.
	it allows failing only if the stacktrace hits in this range.
5. see what really happens.
