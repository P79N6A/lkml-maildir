There is one more here.  We also have Xen HVM which will soon want to be 
paravirtualized too.  We don't want the current xen paravirt_ops for 
that as they have a lot of things that HVM does not need.
Since KVM and Xen HVM have the least requirements in term of guest 
modifications, they are probably the obviously places to start.
