If you could get unabridged profiling data for raw vs. fs (so it can
be properly sorted) I would be interested in that. Early indications
were large amounts of time spent in shrink_zone(), obtained by
re-sorting the truncated profile listings. It indicated the time spent
in shrink_zone() was 26.3 times as much time spent in default_idle().
Typically copying to and from userspace are enormous overheads, but
aren't observable in the truncated/mis-sorted profiles, which calls
them into question, barring unreported usage of O_DIRECT. There are
also no totals reported, which are helpful for interpreting realtime
behavior.
