Fun... OK, folks. There was a bug in ext2 (and damn next to every other
local fs) since 2.3.7. Sometimes (depending on phase of moon, pagecache
contents and a bunch of other shit) truncate() leaves the tail of last
block not zeroed. Looks like it surfaced from time to time, but had been
mostly unnoticed. Something in the last kernels made it show up more
often.
I dearly hope that patch I've posted today will fix the bloody thing
for good. Because if it will not we've got something else to deal with.
As for the bug itself - look at the truncate_inode_pages() (part that does
zero-out of the partial page) and ask yourself: WTF will happen if
pagecache has nothing for that file? Had been there for more than a
year...
