It means there is one 'thread'. Ergo, you do not have the possibility
of running this as you would a true HT P4.  There are a limited number
of Northwood P4's out there which do support HT and have >1 sibling,
but asides from those, you'll need a Xeon to take advantage of it.
There are countless rumours of being able to enable extra siblings
by poking MSRs, but not one person has to my knowledge achieved this.
Some folks have also allegedly found that snipping pins or wiring extra
bits to them have enabled the 'extra sibling'. Whether this is true or
not, and whether it is 100% equivalent to a real HT part is again,
questionable.
