I am hoping for a reconciliation where the people who don't like
AppArmor live with it by not using it. AppArmor is not intended to
replace SELinux, it is intended to address a different set of goals.

We argue that the proposed patch is a viable solution for providing
AppArmor functionality. We would be happy for specific suggestions on
how to make it better.

AppArmor's advantages come from the model, not the tools. AppArmor is
not inferior to SELinux, it is different than SELinux. Neither can
replace the other without horrid kludges.
