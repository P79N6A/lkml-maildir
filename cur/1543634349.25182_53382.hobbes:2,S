Indeed.
One reason for being interested in a lot more numbers and a variety of loads 
is that there's an effect, predicted by Andea, that I'm watching for:  both 
aging+rmap and lru+rmap do swapout in random order with respect to virtual 
memory, and this should in theory cause increased seeking on swap-in.  We 
didn't see any sign of such degradation vs mainline, in fact we saw a 
significant overall speedup.  It could be we just haven't got enough data 
yet, or maybe there really is more seeking for each swap-in, but the effect 
of less swapping overall is dominant.
