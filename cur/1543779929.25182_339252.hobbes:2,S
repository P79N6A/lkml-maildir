If I want to upgrade my IDE Hard drive by my self, how can I restore that kind 
of data on other diferent PC? HPA should not exist, there are a lot of other 
ways to store restore or diagnostics apps, Hibernation and Quick Restores 
should be handled in other way, I have once an omnibook (earth unplugged) and 
I can only reinstall Linux, because the host protected area does not allow me 
to install The Original OS, in other PC with the porper hardware and back it 
to the laptop.
This HPA should be optional, but never by default, I once need to have them 
disabled (where is the specifications from the manufacturer to reproduce them 
in a new hard disk media).
