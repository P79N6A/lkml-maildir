Great, thanks for the testing, the set of patches you tested is correct.
(I think there is one minor anomaly in your patch backport, which has no
effect on the validity of your testing: you've probably ended up with two
separate calls to set_page_dirty in your follow_page, because that moved
between 2.6.5 and 2.6.13.  It doesn't matter, but you might want to tidy
that up one way or the other if you're passing your patch on further.)
