And as everybody knows in servers is a popular practice to disable it.
According to an interview to the kernel.org admins....
"Beyond that, Peter noted, "very little fancy is going on, and that is good
because fancy is hard to maintain." He explained that the only fancy thing
being done is that all filesystems are mounted noatime meaning that the
system doesn't have to make writes to the filesystem for files which are
simply being read, "that cut the load average in half."
I bet that some people would consider such performance hit a bug...
