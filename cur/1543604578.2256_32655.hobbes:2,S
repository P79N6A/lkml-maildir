I've used it on multiple 2.2 systems as well (Dual Celeron/BX400++HPT366,
Via/Duron, PII/BX440 etc) and never had a problem.

Yeah.
I've used it for a long time and only once had a small issue with it (which
didn't impose data corruption, just one app (UML) didn't work since mmap on
old 2.2 reiser was somewhat broken).

I thought you could get LFS on reiser on 2.2 with the LFS patch and some
patch to reiser? I'm not sure though. SuSE did ship with 2.2, reiser and
large file support...

Nowdays, though, I think I 2.4 is beginning to be stable enough for just
about anything. The first 2.4 kernels were terrible wrt vm - they'd go ahead
killing innocent daemons when I did a simple diff -R /usr/src/linux
/usr/src/linux2 with hundreds of MBs free RAM.
