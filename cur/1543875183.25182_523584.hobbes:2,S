My point is:
a) Ken observes that obtaining private hugetlb memory via hugetlbfs
   involves "fuss".
b) the libhugetlbfs maintainers then go off and implement a no-fuss way of
   doing this.
c) voila, people can now use the new no-fuss interface on older kernels.
   Whereas Ken's kernel patch would require that they upgrade to a new
   kernel.
It wasn't a vary big point ;) I'm assuming that users find that upgrading
libhugetlb is less costly than upgrading their kernel.

You got it.
The fact that a kernel interface is "hard to use" really shouldn't be an
issue for us, because that hardness can be addressed in libraries.  Kernel
interfaces should be good, and complete, and maintainable, and etcetera. 
If that means that they end up hard to use, well, that's not necessarily a
bad thing.  I'm not sure that in all cases we want to be optimising for
ease-of-use just because libraries-are-hard.
But for non-programming reasons, we're just not there yet: people want to
program direct to the kernel interfaces simply because of the
distribution/coordination problems with libraries.  It would be nice to fix
that problem.
For a counter-example, look at futexes.  Their kernel interfaces are
*damned* hard to use.  But practically nobody is affected by that because
glibc solved the problem and programmers just use the pthread API.
More of this, please ;)
