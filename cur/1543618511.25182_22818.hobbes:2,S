Hi,
Since I have tryied to use atyfb (2.4.x) I've never been able to make it
work. Even on the new 2.5 and the dj4 one it fails.
This is my card:
ATI Technologies Inc Rage Mobility P/M AGP 2x (rev 100)
I don't know if it's supported but at least I know someone that has the
same card and it doesn't work neither.
Should I stop waiting for atyfb to work on my chip?
