Are you using debian(IIRC, you are, but maybe not on this machine?)?
Are you using the old version in debian stable?  Id suggest upgrading to the
new version available in testing, or possibly unstable (probably only
problems compiling on non-i386 arches).
The debian package maintainer doesn't like the version in stable at all, but
policy dictates that only security fixes and such go in the stable series...
