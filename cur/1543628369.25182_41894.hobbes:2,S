Richard,
I agree The least offensive way would be to pass in a sring from the caller,
I didn't spot the second endian bug till you mentioned it ;-).
I wish Linus would finally get rid of the errno global as this is equally
stupid on smp machines or else make an errno_array[NR_CPUS] array
& make errno a #define errno errno_array[smp_processor_id()] or 
something similar, plenty of others have posted patches for that
rubbish.
Alan Cox is on the list of Authors, he must have wrote it ;-)
