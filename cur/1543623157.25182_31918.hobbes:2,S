	Yes, the arp_prefsrc feature can depend on rp_filter||arp_filter
but I prefer to keep it independent. And there is an agreement on netdev
that all ARP filtering issues (including the problem with shared IPs
in clusters) should be fixed by maintaining ARP hooks for universal
filtering. Then even the arp_prefsrc feature can be implemented with
proper rules. TODO. Until then, this is a temp solution.
