Well, sort of.  Samefile without keeping fds open doesn't have any
protection against the tree changing underneath between first
registering a file and later opening it.  The inode number is more
useful in this respect.  In fact inode number + generation number will
give you a unique identifier in time as well, which is a _lot_ more
useful to determine if the file you are checking is actually the same
as one that you've come across previously.
So instead of samefile() I'd still suggest an extended attribute
interface which exports the file's unique (in space and time)
identifier as an opaque cookie.
For filesystems like FAT you can basically only guarantee that two
files are the same as long as those files are in the icache, no matter
if you use samefile() or inode numbers.  Userpace _can_ make the
inodes stay in the cache by keeping the files open, which works for
samefile as well as checking by inode number.
