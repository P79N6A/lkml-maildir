I remember a discussion a while ago where it
was mentioned that one could force certain drivers to
be compiled in to the kernel by creating a certain
file with a list of the desired exeptions to the
allmodconfig target.  Is this still true for 2.6?
Is there documentation somewhere that I should read?
I don't seem to be able to find it.
Else, could some kind soul name the file and
show the format?
Thanks,
