I'm using latest Debian Woody - up to date packages, so I don't think that 
should be the problem.

First I used 2.2.19pre17 and everything was fine, now unfortunately I had to 
move to 2.4.x and tried 2.4.17 and now 2.4.7 (both Debian customized). Of 
course I enabled apm ("apm=on" kernel parameter and also "Enable PM at boot 
time"). As this didn't work, I also tried "User real mode APM...", "Allow 
Interrupts..." and I tried ACPI instead. All didn't work!
So is there anything else I can do?
