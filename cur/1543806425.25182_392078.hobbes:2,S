Because Jorg has maintained the program for a decade, has found and 
supported new vendors and devices, he seems to get new hardware sooner 
than most, and many programs and scripts use his program as an output stage.
Unless someone wants to dedicate themselves to do such a program things 
will go the way of certain other programs which were "the best" before 
they were obsolete. There's a reason why the list is called cdwrite, and 
no one uses that any more.
Joerg is technically astute, and has no clue how to interface with 
people without pissing them off. He loves the obsolete sg interface, he 
thinks his DVD-pro thing will make money but the last time I checked he 
didn't tke credit cards or paypal, and he just has no people skills or 
interest in learning them.
That's why people put up with him, he continues to support what he does.
