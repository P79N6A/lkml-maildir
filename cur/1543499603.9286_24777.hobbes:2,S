That would be an awesome card, wouldn't it? ;)
I've a K6-2/350, and it's mtrr's seem to be working fine with 2.2.10. 
In rc.local I have:
echo "base=0x0e7800000 size=0x800000 type=write-combining" > /proc/mtrr
which results in:
me2v:reliant rc.d$ cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0xe7800000 (3704MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
My base address was, of course, taken from my X startup messages. 
Perhaps you should look there for the base?  and size should equal
whatever the size is on your video card--I think all this is described
in Documentation/mtrr.txt...
