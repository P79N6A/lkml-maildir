Not precisely sure where this should go - but I figure this is a likely
list to try.
I have 2.4.0-test6 running here.  I've recently installed a brand new 30
gig hd with an empty ext2 filesystem, and decided to try creating a file
larger than 2 gigs on it.
uname -a:
Linux eriador 2.4.0-test6 #1 SMP Sun Aug 20 17:09:04 EDT 2000 i686 unknown
File was created using:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/disk2/3gigfile bs=2048 count=1500000
Output of df:
/dev/hdb1             29561392   3002956  25056764  11% /mnt/disk2
Output of ls -al:
total 3002960
drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root         4096 Aug 22 09:46 ./

3gigfile
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root        16384 Aug 21 00:57 lost+found/
That seemed to happen ~2 gig in size (I was making use of 'watch' at the
time to watch the file grow).  Someone mentioned that it would be right
around the limit for a 32 bit integer.
Interestingly enough, perl's stat() returns -1222967296 bytes.
