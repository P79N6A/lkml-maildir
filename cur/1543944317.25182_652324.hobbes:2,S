I do agree that kgdb and watchdogs aren't like to work well together. And 
I don't think you can sanely expect to not have a "disable lockup 
detection" when you start poking around with kgdb.
We also just have to expect that time will also stop while sometbody is 
messing around with kgdb.
So I don't dispute that any kernel debugger will *always* be intrusive in 
those ways. That's pretty inevitable. I just think the code itself can try 
to avoid hooking into various places all over the map.
