Subject: NexGen Nx586: documentation error?

In Documentation/Configure.help, the help for Proceesor family
recommends selecting '486' for a NexGen Nx586.  I have one of these
beasts, and choosing this fails to boot because the Nx586 apparently
does not honor the WP bit.  I could only manage to boot a kernel
compiled for 386 and including FP emulation.
Is there a BIOS setting I need to frob, or is a documentation error?
If someone else with a NexGen Nx586 could chime in, I'll put together
the patch if it's indeed the help that's wrong.
