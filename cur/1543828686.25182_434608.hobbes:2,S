The open() call is not in itself the problem.
I would guess that the problem is sparked by the TEST UNIT READY command
automatically sent when the device file is opened.  Although a drive
should have no difficulty handling this command while carrying out a burn,
apparently yours aborts.  In other words, this is likely to be a firmware 
problem in the CD drive.
I can't tell what's going on with the USB HDD since you haven't provided 
any information.
If you want to find out what's actually happening instead of just 
guessing, turn on CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DEBUG and see what the kernel log has 
to say for the time when the underrun/reset occurs.
