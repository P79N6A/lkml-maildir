Some folk I've done some consulting work for bought a zillion
Promise SATA cards.  They were able to convince Promise to
release their SATA driver, which was formerly available only as 
a binary only kernel module, under the terms of the GPL.
So <drum-roll, trumpets> here it is: the Promise SATA driver for
the PDC20318, PDC20375, PDC20378, and PDC20618.  This driver is
released as-is.  It is useful for the
	Promise SATA150 TX4
	Promise SATA150 TX2plus
	Promise SATA 378
	Promise Ultra 618
cards.  As a temporary download location, the GPL'd driver can be
obtained from 
http://www.busybox.net/pdc-ultra-1.00.0.10.tgz
Have fun!  And many thanks to Promise for contributing the driver
for their cards!
 -Erik
