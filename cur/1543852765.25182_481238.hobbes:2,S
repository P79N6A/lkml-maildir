No intel document guarantees you that if more CPUs simultaneously execute 
locked cmpxchg in a loop that a CPU will see compare success in a finite 
time. In fact, CPUs can't guarantee this at all, because they don't know 
that they're executing a spinlock --- for them its just an instruction 
stream like anything else.
Intel only guarantees that cmpxchg (or any other instruction) completes in 
finite time, but it doesn't say anything about the result of it.

<= 2.4 scheduler worked exactly like this. 2.6 has it more complicated, 
but does similar thing. But you are right that starvation on semaphore can 
happen, if the process has too high nice value, it will never be risen 
above other processes.
