Ok, that commit looks nice in many ways, so I'd be loathe to revert it 
entirely.
Can you try it with this patch that re-introduces the "total overkill" 
slack calculations, and probably makes them even worse (there's a few 
left-shifts added, and now it will left-shift the extra slacktoo).
But there are also some unexplained changes in that patch, so maybe the 
size allocation isn't the big problem. For example, now "call_allocate()" 
will set task->tk_status to zero which is totally strange.
But if it's the allocation that is too small, this patch may help.
Trond, Chuck?
