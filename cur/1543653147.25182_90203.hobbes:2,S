if you put it on the network, the best you can do is restrict the problem to 
being link-local. If you exclude wireless, then the problem is basically then 
a matter of physical security, which isn't much different to having a console 
running on the box itself.

I was completely confused when I first read this. 
I take it that you mean:
On machine under test (the target in the debug context) you make TTL=1 on 
outgoing packets, and drop incoming packets that don't have TTL=255
On machine being used to view console (the host in the debug context) you make 
TTL=255 on outgoing packets.
That doesn't ensure that the machine you are monitoring (or debugging) is 
really the machine you think it is, but it might solve enough of the problem.

It prevents source field spoofing. I don't know how much defence you get from 
this on fielded routers, but faking the source field in a UDP packet doesn't 
seem too hard.
TTL=255 ensures that the machine you are talking to is _really_ on the same 
link. Any other number is subject to an attacker knowing how many hops it is, 
and setting TTL appropriately.
