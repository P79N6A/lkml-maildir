It shouldn't, but I definitely get them. It starts off with:
Feb 24 20:45:10 snoopy kernel: eth0: unexpected TX-done interrupt, lasttx=20.
Feb 24 20:45:10 snoopy last message repeated 8 times
Feb 24 20:45:10 snoopy kernel: eth0: Too much work at interrupt, status 0xff
It is not and IRQ conflict. It only seems to occur under high network load
(the load on my network is mostly light). There may be other criteria, too,
however I have not been able to isolate it yet.  From this point on, my
network card has crashed, and requires a reboot to fix.
Then the messages continues off as:
Hw. address read/write mismap 0
Hw. address read/write mismap 1
Hw. address read/write mismap 2
Hw. address read/write mismap 3
Hw. address read/write mismap 4
Hw. address read/write mismap 5
eth0: trigger_send() called with the transmitter busy.
I looked up the error message I get in 8390.c
Based on this I have the following questions:
1. Does the fact that "Hw. address read/write mismap" appears, and this
   is in "NS8390_init" indicate that an attempt is being made to reset
   the card? I get the impression that the hardware address looks like
   it might be invalid from the message, however, the output of
   "ifconfig eth0" shows the correct value. If however, the address
   has been currupted, it would explain everything else, however
   I don't understand how the test works.
2. What would cause "unexpected TX-done" other then IRQ conflict?
3. I find this line in "ei_tx_intr" highly suspicious, however I don't
   understand what it is used for:
        ei_local->txqueue--;
   The reason I am suspicious, is that it appears to me that it decreases
   the size of the txqueue, ie it assumes that something has been transmitted.
   However, this is also declared an "unexpected TX-done interrupt", meaning
   (I guess) that nothing was transmitted, so ei_local->txqueue would
   become invalid.  Please correct me if I am wrong; I know nothing
   about the Linux kernel source or Ethernet adaptors, but am looking
   at the source because this problem is getting to be irratating, and
   I have come to expect higher reliability from Linux.
   However, if I am right, it might explain some messages, such as
eth0: trigger_send() called with the transmitter busy.
   if the txqueue size has become invalidated. I don't think it is
   that simple though.
I have to wonder if it is because my Ethernet card is slightly
incompatable with 2.1.X and 2.2.X, however, I never had problems
with 2.0.X...
