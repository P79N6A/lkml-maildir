Just out of curiosity, how much can you change with the microcode, in terms
of processor "behavior"? And what processors support it?
And what about the microcode, is there any information on how to "build your
own"
or are you limited to the ones prepackaged by intel?
Any URL where I can read more about it would do fine... It's not like I intend
to do anything with it but, it's the first time I hear about this feature and
I would like to know more.
