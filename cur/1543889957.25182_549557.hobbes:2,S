So there is no output from lockdep, during the rmmod hang ? The rmmod
sucks 100% cpu, so it busy loops at some place. Looking at the stack
trace this seems to be in:
void cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(struct workqueue_struct *wq,                                                                                                                 
                                       struct delayed_work *dwork)                                                                                                                  
{                                                                                                                                                                                   
        while (!cancel_delayed_work(dwork))                                                                                                                                         
                flush_workqueue(wq);                                                                                                                                                
}
which is not really related to timers :)
