	I got it stable by switching from ordered data mode to
	journaled mode, it runs very stable now. I have Journal 
	Block Device support turned on, maybe something about
	not using journal data mode with that enabled. Do all new
	ext3 version partitions default to ordered mode ? 
	Happy it works now anyway :)
