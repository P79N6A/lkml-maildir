Today, that call does fail:
        if (!port->read_urb) {
                /* this is needed for some brain dead Sony devices */
                dev_err(&port->dev, "Device lied about number of ports, please use a lower one.\n");
                return -ENODEV;
        }
Let's not change that logic please.

But why?  Do you know some kind of protocol that this endpoint can
accept that is valid for the device?  If not, let's not mess with it.
