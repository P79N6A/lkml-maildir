Actually it's only available as a module... i think that with some
little modifications it could be transformed into a patch to build
into the kernel. I've not too much time in these days (i'm graduating
on 10th October, LNLB will be my graduation thesis ;-) )... i'll try
to search about and see if it's a short work to do. If not I'll delay
the patch after my graduation,

Good point,
I edited the site and added a link to the project's forum page on
sourceforge (I think it's the best and quickest way to do it)
