Hmm. I don't know if it's stgit per se. Maybe the breakage came from a 
mercurial merge that got exported to git as a patch, rather than as a 
merge.
If that's the case, then I'm afraid that the problem is the mercurial 
part, or at least the hg->git conversion. I have no idea how hg does 
merges, and maybe the broken merge was done in the hg tree. 
The really sad part about this is that it means I have to be much more 
careful with dvb merges, since I can't trust the tree any more, when it 
apparently has something strange going on. If things like this keep on 
happening, I'll have to ask you guys to change your work habits.
That said, I _tried_ to check for similar cases in the past history, and I 
couldn't find any. So hopefully this was a one-off occurrence.
