Subject: [QUESTION] Stopping RAID devices from Magic SysRq?

I was curious if anyone has previosly considered adding a raid-stop
functionality to the magic sysrq command?  I realize that a full raid-stop
would make the partition unavailable for read-only access, which may
require the system to be immediately reset.  Is there a mechanism to
remount a raid device read-only if all mounts from it are read-only (i.e.,
marking the raid superblock clean, syncing, and then only allowing
read-only access)?
Thanks, Ryan
