Sorry, I misunderstood what you meant.  I presume you think that the 
interrupt may be triggered immediately the command packet has been sent but 
before 400ns delay had occurred. 
NO - with Alan's patch alone, this did not work. 
The delay seesm to be needed in the path between the interrupt occuring and 
the IDE_STATUS_REG being read. 
I had seen an note on a web site that said that there was two delays 
required in the ATA/ATAPI spec - the 400ns which Alan's patch deals with and 
a shorter delay (one PIO cycle) between busy being cleared and DRQ reaching 
the correct state where the technique had been to read the ALTSTATUS 
register.  That was why I had tried that approach but found it not to work. 
(I have subsequently downloaded a copy of the full spec and haven't been 
able to find this - but then its just short of 500 pages of dense text:-)). 
Thinking about it now, I tried the ALTSTATUS delay before applying Alan's 
patch, so maybe its the some of the two delays that maybe necessary.  If you 
think its appropriate I will try that again this evening.
