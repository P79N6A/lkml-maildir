In my hardware setup, Linux is running in PCI option mode on a IXP455
processor and it exposes a segment of the IXP455's memory so that it is
available on the PCI bus. The other processor (a pentium M running
Windows OS) sees this exposed IXP455 memory as PCI memory from it's
perspective.

I'll take a look telling the kernel it has less memory that there
physically exists and use ioremap() to map it in.
