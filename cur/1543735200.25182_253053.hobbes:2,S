Color me confused - this cpuset_sem down/up should not be needed,
and should deadlock.  In the call chain:
    cpuset_mkdir -> cpuset_create -> cpuset_populate_dir -> cpuset_add_file
cpuset_create() already holds the cpuset_sem for the duration, and you're
adding another cpuset_sem down in cpuset_add_file(), which should deadlock.
If you are seeing the duplicate invalid cpuset entries, then must be
something else going on, unfortunately.
That, or I'm confused.
