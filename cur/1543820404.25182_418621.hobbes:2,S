Yeah, you'd have to avoid allowing hostile ELF loaders to execute, but
even they are impeded somewhat: they can't use PROT_EXEC mappings but
have to e.g. use an executable stack hack.
To mix a metaphor badly, it raises the bar; it doesn't burn down the
gym.

The JVM example is a bit nasty, I'll admit. (Of course I'm safe because
my stripped-down firewall only includes one interpreter, perl, and
that's executable by root only. ;) )
