You may avoid library calls by doing system calls directly.  Look at
(g)libc
sources to see how "fread()" etc. is implemented.  
I don't think you can avoid the stack completely, but you can probably
keep it down
to 1 page.  Don't use any local non-static variables.  Keep them all
global or static.  If you want to be extreme - implement everything in
main() and use goto's instead of functions.  This is normally not
necessary though,
you can safely use functions if you keep the nesting limit low. The
return
address, parameters, and local variables is what you get on the stack -
make 
sure parameter lists are short and that the works-case usage is way
below the page size.
You can avoid parameters by using global variables instead.  Don't use
recursion.
