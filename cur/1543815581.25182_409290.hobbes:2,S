I added this patch to the rdma_cm branch in my git tree.  When I was
doing that, I noticed that it builds rdma_ucm.ko unconditionally.  It
seems that we want this to depend on CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS,
since that controls ib_uverbs.ko and ib_ucm.ko.
To do this I rejiggered the Kconfig and Makefile changes I made
before.  I made CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS into a bool (instead of a
tristate), so that it's 'y' if INFINIBAND and INET are on, and made
the top of the Makefile look like:
infiniband-$(CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS)	:= ib_addr.o rdma_cm.o
user_access-$(CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS)	:= rdma_ucm.o
obj-$(CONFIG_INFINIBAND) +=		ib_core.o ib_mad.o ib_sa.o \
					ib_cm.o $(infiniband-y)
obj-$(CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_MAD) +=	ib_umad.o
obj-$(CONFIG_INFINIBAND_USER_ACCESS) +=	ib_uverbs.o ib_ucm.o $(user_access-y)
I'm pretty sure this does exactly what we want.
