Interesting.  Playing with i_size like that in writepage() _is_ scary.  My
immediate reaction is that if this race was real, it's so gross that we
would have spotted it before now in either 2.4 or 2.5->2.6.
Easy test: Steve, could you remove that memset from
block_write_full_page(), see if it changes anything?
It's not very important - it's there because if an application
(incorrectly) writes to mapped data outside EOF we're supposed to drop
their data and write zeroes instead.

i_size is updated in generic_commit_write(), on a per-page basis, or I'm
missing something?  I sure hope so.
Let's go through the scenarios.
On entry to block_write_full_page(), i_size is in the middle of this page
somewhere.  We're worried that i_size can change, and that this will cause
block_write_full_page() to incorrectly zero out the tail of the page.
Well we can stop right there, because the only way someone can get some
more non-zero user data into this page before we memset and write it is by
locking the page beforehand, and block_write_full_page() has the page lock.
(Or they can write stuff into it via mmap, but writing to the page outside
i_size is an application bug).
Other ways in which i_size can change under block_write_full_page()'s feet
are:
- Someone did a truncate.
  No problem - the page is about to be invalidated and chopped off the
  file anyway.
- Someone did an extending truncate into another page.
  OK, i_size will increase but we're still supposed to write zeroes into
  the rest of this page outside the previous i_size.
- Someone extended the file into another page with lseek+write or pwrite.
  Same argumentation as with extending truncate.
- Someone did an extending truncate to another i_size which lands
  *within* this page.
  Writing zeroes is still OK: nobody can get into this page to write new
  user data anyway - it's locked.
Either all that, or I missed something ;) If Steve can try that test it
would be interesting.  Even if removing the memset does make the corruption
go away, this might not be a kernel bug - it could be that the application
is incorrectly relying on mmapped writes outside i_size making it to disk.
As for O_DIRECT: I need to think about that a bit more.  We hold i_sem and
have done an fdatasync prior to entering generic_file_aio_write_nolock() so
there should be no dirty pagecache at this stage anyway.  The VM may decide
to dirty some pagecache and then block_write_full_page() could come in and
look at i_size and race against generic_file_aio_write_nolock()'s O_DIRECT
i_size_write().  But I doubt if bk is using direct-IO in combination with
MAP_SHARED...
