   Larry talked about some sort of
   guarantees that involve GPL-ing of BK code 1-2 years after it's first used
   by the kernel, to make sure the Linux kernel tree is not left in limbo.
Ingo, he promised this if the bitkeeper logging went down for
a period of time or if bitkeeper were to go out of buisness.
He did not promise this just because we use it for kernel development
for 1-2 years, are you out of your mind? :-)
