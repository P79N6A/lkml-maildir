The LED devices I'm using are nothing like any of the devices in the
input subsystem at all -- they don't generate events _ever_ for
instance.  /dev/input/event## for a pure LED device would be rather
boring.
IMO it's cleaner to have a LED subsystem and proxy drivers to expose
LEDs provided by other subsystems to the generic interface, rather than
trying to ram everything onto the input subsystem regardless of how well
it fits.
Of course, other opinions may (will) differ ;-).
If you did want to get the LED change events from the LED subsystem
through the input layer, you could add a hook into led_set_real in
leds.c, but since all changes are software triggered I don't really see
the value in that.
