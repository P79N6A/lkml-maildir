Justin used to say "use my latest driver" when people reported problems.
Read lkml.
Its great if Justins new driver fixes the problems, but as I told him I
thought it was too late for it to be included. Thats my bad, too, because
if I had included it early in 2.4.21pre it could be in now.
Justin could well have fixed the problems in the current driver instead
answering "use my latest driver", couldnt he?
