I think that could be made to work, and it would fix the performance
issue.
It is a behaviour change.  At present ext3 (for example) commits everything
every five seconds.  After a change like this, a crash+recovery could cause
a file's atime to go backwards by an arbitrarily large time interval - it
could easily be months.
