I went to the trouble of making the PDA completely set up before any C 
code ran.  Did you undo that?
Andrew mentioned that people have various hacks which hook into mcount, 
and want to use current/smp_processor_id, which means that that they 
have to work from the first function prologue.
It also simplifies things to get all that set up ASAP so there's no 
bootstrap dependency problem.
