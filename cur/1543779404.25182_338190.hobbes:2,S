Not at all. It's enough to let the laptop lie on the table for [0,0]G
calibration, then put sequentially it on all the four sides for [-1,0]G,
[1,0]G, [0,1]G, [0,-1]G calibration.
From these five measurements you have both the zero point and the
slopes, including a good error estimate.
I've done that before when toying with IMUs.
