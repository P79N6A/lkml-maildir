So... You understand that if /var/home and /var/log are on one file system,
you can hard-link, and you set your system up knowing that, and then you're
*surprised* that:

"Doctor, it hurts when I do this.." "Well, don't do that then".
I think the first time I saw the recommendation "Put /home on its own
filesystem and don't give users directly writable directories on /var (except
via set-uid helpers) so they can't play hardlink games" back in 1983 or so.
I know that when SunOS 3.1 came out, that was already well-understood basic
sysadmining.  Sometimes, there's actual good reasons behind 20-year-old
voodoo.. ;)
You sure you don't want to redesign your filesystem layout so you don't
have to worry about your malicious users hardlinking stuff? Might be a lot
easier than trying to get the kernel to do what you want in this case....
