IFS is just one of the *many* issues (there's also a ton of race conditions
caused by #! handling, among other things).
You don't like the shell script, feel free to substitude in the C-language

(And yes, I did it intentionally - figuring that at least one user on the

shoot themselves in the foot with, so weaponry loaded with blanks seemed a
