One question I've wondered about for a bit...
The diff between each dot release (ala 2.6.12.0->2.6.12.1) can theoretically 
be backported to an older kernel.  So in theory, at least some of the new 
security fixes can be applied to older kernels.  (Yeah, this necessarily 
complete.  Whether or not the patch makes any sense at all in the older 
context, and whether or not that's everything they need to do...  That's a 
seperate issue.  It allows some minimal, relatively straightforward 
maintenance to be done on systems that are stuck with older kernels by 
management fiat.
The gap is the jump to the next major release.  Suppose that 2.6.15 makes it 
up to 2.6.15.10, and then 2.6.16 comes out.  Are there any security fixes in 
2.6.16 that weren't in 2.6.15.10?  Fixes which would have been in a 2.6.15.11 
if the next big release had been delayed another two weeks?
From a practical standpoint, somebody stuck on 2.6.15 for another six months 
is likely to at least try to apply the next security update (the diff between 
2.6.16->2.6.16.1) to their old kernel, but are they missing a week or two's 
worth of security fixes?
I'm trying to clarify what my question is:  When a new stable kernel comes 
out, do the dot-release guys do one more release of security-only fixes to 
patch all the known vulnerabilities that the new one addressed before moving 
on?  Or do they just leave a gap and say "upgrade"?
