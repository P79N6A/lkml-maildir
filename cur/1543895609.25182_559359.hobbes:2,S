no it couldn't
the GPLv2 says that if you combine it with any other license the result 
must be GPLv2
the GPLv3 says that if you combine it with any other license the result 
must be GPLv3
so you have one requirement saying that the result must be GPLv2 and 
another that says you must be GPLv3. there isn't any way to resolve this 
conflict.
