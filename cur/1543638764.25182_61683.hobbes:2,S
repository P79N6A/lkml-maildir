From there I get 'permission denied', but I got it somewhere else (google 
is great).
However, it does not apply cleanly to 2.4.19. It is already partly in, as 
it seems, but there are some rejects that are not obvious to fix for me. 
If this patch still makes sense, it would be great if someone with more 
knowledge/experience than me could have a look...

Yes, this kind of stuff. But we use it "only" to buffer some 600GB of 
valuable physics data before it can go to tape ;-)
