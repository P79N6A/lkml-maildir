Obvious reason: compatibility.
Files with CRLF<->LF translation enabled have many of the same problems
found in the /proc filesystem. These files are _not_ regular files.
I suggest a new type code. Then you can kill mmap() and other features.
That leaves a file type that is more like a socket, char device, fifo...
Perhaps "less" will even work right, unlike now.
Type code 0x3000 (030000) has been free since v7, where it was used to
indicate multiplexed char devices.
