Forget this all.
I found the problem trigger, it's reading from /proc/apm, for a reason I
cannot currently see.
Current config, as far as it's APM-related:
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is not set
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT=y
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS=y
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
# CONFIG_TOSHIBA is not set
I had found out that my clock was slow while dnetc was running. I had a
dummy loader that just did while(1) {} which did not slow my clock. Now, I
straced that dnetc beast and found out that it reads /proc/apm quite
often.
I can have my clock almost halt with this one:
while cat /proc/apm ; do : ; done
If I leave this running for 15 s, my system time drifts back 11½ s.
Relevant dmesg:
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.13)
Board: Gigabyte 7ZXR, BIOS rev. F4 (VIA KT133 chip set, AMIBIOS).
I can and will test further, also with recompiled kernels, but I need
directions what to test.
