With Gigabit etherenet, the pages that you are coping will never be
touched again -> that means that its age will never will increase,
that means that it will only remove pages from the cache that are
younger/have been a lot of time without being used.  That looks quite
ok to me.  Notice that the fact that the pages came from the Gigabit
ethernet makes no diference that if you copy from other medium.  Only
difference is that you will get them only faster.
Later, Juan.
