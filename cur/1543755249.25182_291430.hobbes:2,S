I had thought that it was any kicking out to swap - apart from kicking
tmpfs/shmem pages to swap, which should happen independently of Mapped.
If you're not using tmpfs or shmem, then I'm surprised by that figure.
There was 88 kB out to swap in your original /proc/meminfo, which we
may suppose was before Mapped went negative; but above shows more since.

Worth doing, thank you.  Rene has sent us the GCC-3.4 output,
but I've not spotted anything the matter with it yet.
