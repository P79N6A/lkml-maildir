 Subject: [Lhms-devel] Making hotremovable attribute with memory section[3/4]
----
This patch is define __GFP_HOTREMOVABLE attribute.
Kernel can select attribute removable/un-removable section and allocate 
the pages by it.
Note:
  The value of __ GFP_HOTREMOVABLE was 0x03 in the definition before.
 This was used to make new hot-removable zone_list for same purpose.
 This zone_list method had the advantage that the number of steps 
 of main routes did not increase. 
  However, all section's removable attributes in a node have to be
 same in this method. So, this is meaningless on SMP machine.
 
 Dividing free_area is to be more general way for localized allocation.
