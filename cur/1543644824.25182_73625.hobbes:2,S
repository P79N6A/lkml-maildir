   Well, true - we have per hashchain locks, but are we now adding
   the times we need to lookup something on this chain because we now 
   have additional info other than the route, is what I was
   wondering..?
That's what I meant by "extending the lookup key", consider if we
took "next protocol, src port, dst port" into account.
