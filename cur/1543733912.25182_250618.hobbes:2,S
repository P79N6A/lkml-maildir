 GREAT.
 thank you, that means i _can_ put full path names into an
 iptables rule, which will make life a lot easier from a userspace
 perspective.  i'm a bit worried about keeping the rules list
 up-to-date if an inode changes.
 fireflier already constructs the full path name of the executable
 in its userspace code, for comparison against its rules.
 _i_ accept the performance penalty (per per-packet) but some
 people won't.... and such people will just have to live with
 per-packet firewall rules (not per-packet per-program).
 [or, and i mention this for the benefit of lkml people,
  to create per-program SE/Linux network policy rules, as
  already described by stephen on sel-ml last week]
