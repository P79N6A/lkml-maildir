Thanks, that fixes the oops Pavel reported!
But I now realize the oops I am getting is different...
It happens only if any of these "i810fb, i810_audio or intel-agp"
are compiled in the kernel or insterted as modules.
i810fb, i810_audio or intel-agp load up fine and seem to all work
properly. I only get the oops when I put a card into my cardbus slot.
this is what i think happens, when I put the card in, it sets off some
functions that will try to get a driver for the card I just inserted.
when it gets to the pci_bus_match function, my cards vendor and device 
numbers are tested against a drivers id_table. when that driver is 
"i810fb, i810_audio or intel-agp" (and i810fb, i810_audio or intel-agp
is allready loaded) the id_table is at an address that cant be handled, 
thus cauing the oops. I am having trouble figuring out why 
pci_drv->id_table isnt valid in this case.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Shawn Anderson
