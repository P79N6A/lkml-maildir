Ok - this patch seems to check out fine in testing - no more deadlocking.
Andrew, if this is ok with you I'd really like to see that fix in -mm. Ocfs2
shared write mmap will instantly deadlock without it.
From reading Nick's description of the problem in
mm-fix-fault-vs-invalidate-race-for-linear-mappings.patch I think we're
pretty safe (as I noted before) because Ocfs2 re-checks the mapping under
lock to protect against trucate races. That's been an "unwritten"
requirement of page_mkwrite() anyway.
Speaking of requirements, attached is my sad attempt at documenting the API.
I know it might be merged into ->fault at some point, but we really ought to
have _something_ in the meantime.

[PATCH] Document ->page_mkwrite() locking
There seems to be very little documentation about this callback in general.
The locking in particular is a bit tricky, so it's worth having this in
writing.
