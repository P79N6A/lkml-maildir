Subject: down_trylock doesn't preserve irqstate

One problem we encountered in using down_trylock
is that __down_trylock() uses spin_lock_irq() and spin_unlock_irq(),
which does not preserve the interrupt state of the
caller. So, when down_trylock() is called from a
piece of code that has interrupts disabled, on return
from down_trylock() interrupts would always be enabled.
One solution is the following patch which uses
_irqsave/_irqrestore versions of spinlock. The patch
solves a nasty deadlock (double-trip) in the XFS code.
Please let me know if you have any comments.
thanks,
ananth.
