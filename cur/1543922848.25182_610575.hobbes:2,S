The conversion is already queued in Greg's tree, and in -mm:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/gregkh/patches.git;a=blob;f=driver/drm-convert-from-class_device-to-device-in-drivers-char-drm.patch;h=f993183d1cb017f981cc2232d17930af40459bd8;hb=HEAD
/sys/class/drm will look the same as with the class_device's, only if
!CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED, there will be symlinks instead of
directories, otherwise the same pathes, like for all other (converted)
classes too.
Thanks,
Kay
