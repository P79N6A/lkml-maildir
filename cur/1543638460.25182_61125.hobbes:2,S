Ideally, you can present it as a serial device, and put all the code in 
the kernel.  Look at other serial drivers in linux/drivers/char.  _Linux 
Device Drivers_ is a decent book, but doesn't cover the serial/tty 
interfaces IIRC.  Your best reference is always the kernel source code.
To actually submit a driver, read Documentation/SubmittingDrivers and 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.

P.S. Fix your word wrap :)
