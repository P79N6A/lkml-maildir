Hi all,
Can someone point me towards:
* The ISDN tree that works with 2.1.x
* A dhcp client which works with 2.1.x
?
I'm looking to get both into the Changes file before 2.2.0 hits an ftp site
near you....  Since the ISDN can't be merged right now, we need to at least
point to where to get it.  Similarly, I've not mentioned dhcp because the
only one I know about was stored on an ml.org site.  Does anyone know of a
permanent URL for that?
thanks,
chris
