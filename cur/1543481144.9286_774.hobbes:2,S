This has puzzled me also, due to booting order events and I do not have an
answer.
We first INIT all IDE-code.
Then we do the SCSI-code.
Next we register SCSI-disks.
Finally we register IDE-disks.
In the meantime, we later poke the partition table.
I may not have the exact order, but it goes something like above.

Nope.......a question of who gets first crack at booting is a major
rehack and a tought one too.
