Ideally we would move to something like http/ftp-meets-bittorrent for content
replication.  Then sites which are popular would have lots of mirrors by
default, and dedicated FTP mirror sites would actually share bandwidth ala
bittorrent instead of just having copies of the same data.  If this started
using users' web browser cache as bittorrent mirrors it would be totally
impossible to slashdot a site.
