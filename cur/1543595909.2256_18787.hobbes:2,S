Create arch/Config.in which contains
  define_bool CONFIG_ARCH_i386 n
  define_bool CONFIG_ARCH_ia64 n
  define_bool CONFIG_ARCH_sparc n
etc., then change each of the arch/xxx/Config.in files to
source arch/Config.in as their first line first.  Still ugly but the
mainline configs will be much more readable.  It also guarantees that
any future tests on $CONFIG_ARCH_somearch will work, even if the code
does not use if statements.
