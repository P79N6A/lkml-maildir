Told you, I can't code it.  I could work on making an initial design for the
most important part though, the datasystem that separates the two filesystems
and holds the meta-data and data in self-contained atoms.  I KNOW I won't
get it right the first time, but I can give you a place to start.
I absolutely can not code anything in the kernel at this time.  I've tried.  I'll
get it eventually ;-)
Citing the original message:
[QUOTE]
I know I spout a lot of crap, and wish I could just do it all (can we get
a "Make a small device driver for virtual hardware in Linux 2.4 and 2.5"
tutorial up on kernel.org?!), but I think I've got some good ideas.  At
any rate, the good is kept and the bad is weeded out, right?
[ENDQUOTE]
I actually started pretty sure that someone would want me to come up
with an initial design for the datasystem that is used to control this.
Not that I drew it out before-hand, mind you; I just thought someone
would ask.  I KNEW someone would tell me to code it, which is why
I said I can't right off the bat.
