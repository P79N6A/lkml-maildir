Scott,
  Some of us do use Outlook for a reason, ie Corporate Policies
etc...However, getting defensive of Outlook is _NOT_ the answer. Educate
those around you as to how to _better_ use Outlook. For, example most worms
root through you address book/contacts and take the linked (mailto:) address
from the e mail field. If you are clever, you build a contact and type their
name in the text note section. You lose the ability to let outlook address
your mail, but so does Nimda :-) USE virus protection. E mail ALL virus
incidents to as many e mail addresses as you are comfortable finding in the
MS sales / marketing page.
   Bite them when they call you at work. Example, today MS called me about
their B Central site for website development because some stooge let them
know I need services. I politely told them "no thanks we are doing a SECURE
site" when he said that MS could do a secure site I said "Oh yeah, I forgot
all about Hotmail (run on BSD)" amd hung up.
