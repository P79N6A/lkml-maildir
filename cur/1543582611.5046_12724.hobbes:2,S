Install XFree86 4.0 on a matrox card. Enable pci retries in the config. Wave
large windows around while running a heavy graphical app.
Thats certainly enough to make several sound cards barf and sulk. The matrox
has a bencmarketing feature where they lock the pci bus to get better winbench
type numbers. They arent the only people who do it and thankfully you can turn
it off, but for this specific case its rather useful 8)
