There's nothing stopping the following:  
exec good_proc
	socket()
	fork
	exec bad_proc
Now good_proc and bad_proc are sharing a socket.  Packet comes in
destined for that socket.  Rule says it's ok to deliver to socket
(because of good_proc).  Packet delivered to socket, wakes up waiters
(good and bad).  Now, what's stopping the bad_proc from reading from the
socket?

These do happen, which is part of the problem ;-)

Sure.  Now, take xinted...it happens to close all of the fds except for
the one it's sending on down to the child from within the child just
prior to exec, but you get the idea.

*nod*, or have something that's labelling each context, and match on
that.  even this isn't quite enough, w/out watching how fds get passed
around.

it got through, but does the process you want get the packet?
