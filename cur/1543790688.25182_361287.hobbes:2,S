With or without RCU?  I.e., it's just a straighforward reference counting
solution and RCU is being used to allow incrementing the reference counts
safely.  Otherwise, without RCU you'd need a lock to safely increment the
reference counts.  Also note that with reference counting, the deletes of
the objects can occur any time a reference count is decremented.  So that
would include the notify_call threads as well.
