Is this something that would benefit from several trips around the -mm series?
ISTR that we started with one disk elevator, and now we have 3 or 4 that are
selectable on the fly after some banging around in -mm.  (And yes, I realize that
the only reason we can change the elevator on the fly is because it can switch
from the current to the 'stupid FIFO none' elevator and thence to the new one,
which wouldn't really work for the CPU scheduler....)
All the arguments that support having more than one elevator apply equally
well to the CPU scheduler....
