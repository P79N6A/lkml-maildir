1GB RAM. I've found somewhere that guy did 'disable=X' with X for all
lines in mtrr (we have 6) and then just overrides first with 1Gb of
write-back and then some amount for video (64M for instance) with
uncachable. I just didn't have time to try yet :-)

I'm not sure if vendor would respect such complaint because alienware
supports only windows and Windows doesn't have such problem seems to me.
Anyway how to complain in the right way?
'BIOS errornessly fills Memory Type Range Registers with too many
memory ranges with wrong caching strategies' is it what is happening?

that might be usefull :-)
