The people doing Java Servlets are maybe a small fraction of the Linux
Kernel Hackers community. Not the user community. They simply do not
show up here because they don't care for Linux 2.5.0-rc1-prepatched.
Short head count: Who here is also a regular reader on Apache Jakarta
lists?
Kernel hacking and Java most of the times doesn't mix. And Java folks
are completly ambivalent to their OS: If Linux doesn't deliver,
well. Windows, Solaris and BSD do. That's what Java is all about.
