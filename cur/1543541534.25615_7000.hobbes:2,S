The only difficulty I have seen with this is that the Icon (or whatever) has
to stored multiple times, once for each file. If the thumnail is only 256 bytes
its not a big problem. If it gets to be 32K/64K... (ie a stream that is a
program to do something with the file) then it gets bad. really bad. (consider
having to update all the files that might do that...). A better example would
be things like audio annotation attached to a data file.
