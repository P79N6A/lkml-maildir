	I thought the idea was to take in a proc path instead of a single
number. You could then distinguish between the whole thread group and
individual threads by parsing the string. You'd move a single thread if
you find both the tgid and the tid. If you only get a tgid you'd move
the whole thread group. So:
<pid>                   -> if it's a thread group leader move the whole
			   thread group, otherwise just move the thread
/proc/<tgid>            -> move the whole thread group
/proc/<tgid>/task/<tid> -> move the thread
	Alternatives that come to mind are:
1. Read a flag with the pid
2. Use a special file which expects only thread groups as input
