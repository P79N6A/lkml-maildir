Subject: [PATCH *] VM patch w/ drop behind for 2.4.0-test8-pre1

Hi,
today I released a new version of my VM patch for 2.4.0-test.
This patch should mostly fix streaming IO performance, due
to the following two features:
- drop_behind(), when we do a readahead, move the pages
  'behind' us to the inactive list .. this way we can do
  streaming IO without putting pressure on the working set
- deactivate pages in generic_file_write(), this does
  basically the same ... by moving the pages we write to 
  to the inactive_dirty list, a big download, etc.. doesn't
  impact the working set of the system
I'm particularly interested in the impact of streaming IO on
the performance of the rest of the system with this patch, but
of course also in the performance of the streaming IO itself.
The patch is available from:
