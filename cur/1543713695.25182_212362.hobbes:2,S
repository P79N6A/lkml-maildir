ok, I was a little confused so:
vanilla 2.6.5+this patch: old testgart garbeling problem again
patched 2.6.5-rc3+this patch: everything fine
vanilla 2.6.5+agpgart-2004-04-06.diff+ this patch: everything fine, too
In each cases, I removed all .o and .ko files from drivers/char/agp 
and /lib/modules/2.6.5 to be sure.
Well, I dont care, if its believes to be at AGPv3 mode or not, as long X is 
working fine ;o)
Glück Auf
