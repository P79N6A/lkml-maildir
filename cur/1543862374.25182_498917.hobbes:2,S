We would have one single tree at /sys/devices, and always flat
classification without hierarchy at /sys/class and /sys/bus. If you
enter the device-tree by starting at /sys/class, you get the full path
to the device by reading the link, and get all the device's
dependencies(parents) in the devpath of the device,
I can't see any problem stripping the last element of a path with a
shell script. It's all implemented in current udev and HAL for quite
some time and it's pretty easy.
