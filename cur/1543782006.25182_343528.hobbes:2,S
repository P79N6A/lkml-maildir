The drivers are working correctly; the problem is with the CF flash
adapter you're using.  There are two kinds of CF-to-PCMCIA adapters.
Some are 16-bit PCMCIA cards, which are in most cases limited to a bus
throughput of ~1 MB/sec, regardless of what the CF card is capable
of.  There are also 32-bit CF adapter cards, that are much faster,
limited only by the speed of the CF device.  Here are two:
