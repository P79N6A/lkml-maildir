Note: the precise wording is "MKOLDCOMPAT" and similar.
It is the default devfsd.conf that comes with devfsd.  devfsd is referred to
in the Configure.help entry:
"In particular, make sure you install devfsd.  If you don't, expect to spend
time patching broken code and updating configuration files."
Also in the Configure.help entry:
"This is work in progress. If you want to use this you *must* read
Documentation/filesystems/devfs/README"
The README file details at length much useful information including various
steps for accomplishment and where to find the devfsd package etc.
The devfsd package contains the short and simple code, makefile, man page,
and default devfsd.conf file with numerous well documented default settings.

Your secret cookie is in the Documentation that you should read if you
enable an option in your configuring ;)

Enjoyable is a term I would use.  The simplicity of installation, and the
resulting relief from all the little nagging issues like ttys.
"Everything just works" is something I hear a lot in regards to devfs.
