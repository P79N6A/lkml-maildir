  Hi, all. Version 88 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.0-pre9. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed <devfs_fill_file> to only initialise temporary inodes
- Trap for NULL fops in <devfs_register>
- Return -ENODEV in <devfs_fill_file> for non-driver inodes
- Fixed bug when unswapping non-devfs devices in a devfs
				Regards,
					Richard....
