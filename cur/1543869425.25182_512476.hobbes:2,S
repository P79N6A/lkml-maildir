Actually, with clocksource based gettimeofday(), radeon built-in cannot
work at all.
The reason is that the clocksource code will not jump over to a
clock source other than clocksource_jiffies until the late initcalls
are run, because of this code:
/* clocksource_done_booting - Called near the end of bootup
 *
 * Hack to avoid lots of clocksource churn at boot time
 */
static int __init clocksource_done_booting(void)
{
	finished_booting = 1;
	return 0;
}
late_initcall(clocksource_done_booting);
 ...
struct clocksource *clocksource_get_next(void)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	spin_lock_irqsave(&clocksource_lock, flags);
	if (next_clocksource && finished_booting) {
		curr_clocksource = next_clocksource;
		next_clocksource = NULL;
	}
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&clocksource_lock, flags);
	return curr_clocksource;
}
So even if other clock sources are provided, they'll never show up until
after the radeon driver tries to initialize.
I understand the intention of the clocksource_get_next() code, it doesn't
want to hop onto several different clocksource implementations as the
drivers for those startup, but going through all the module_init() calls
for various drivers without a sane clocksource is just as bad of a problem
and is in fact fatal in this radeon case.
