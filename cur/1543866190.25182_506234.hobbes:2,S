Yeah, yeah!  Works fine once I toggled the WCE to 1.  Writing
flies at 70MB/s, which is extremely good for those desktop-grade
disks (Seagate Barracuda SATA 250GB @7200RPM).
Thank you very much!
But... who do you think I should bug to make this the system
default?  Does write caching need to be enabled by the driver
itself, in the SCSI layer or perhaps by the distro initscripts?
