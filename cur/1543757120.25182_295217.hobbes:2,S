You did.
Then Ted tided it up
Then Bill added hacks to "fix" up the locking
The real fix is shooting the flip buffers, at that point a lot of the
locking goes away (because the tty owns everything relevant). I just
don't have time to do major kernel hacking and finish the MBA thesis at
the same time.
Sorry yes I know how n_tty works, and no I'm not going to fix it
