Great.

That's been bothering me too, but hadn't come up with anything until I
just now looked again.
I'm pretty certain that dmi_scan_machine() wasn't using a fixmap before
(in 2.6.24) since I had to fix a broken xen dom0 patch to handle this
new situation.
Looking at 2.6.24 bt_ioremap(), it would have been hitting this:
     /*                                                                                                                   
      * Don't remap the low PCI/ISA area, it's always mapped..                                                            
      */
        if (phys_addr >= ISA_START_ADDRESS && last_addr < ISA_END_ADDRESS)
                return phys_to_virt(phys_addr);
If I restore this behaviour (i.e. remove Ian's e820 hole and add the
patch below), then I see us still allocating a page table at 0xf0000 but
we don't then try and create a new writable mapping to it later, and
everything goes fine.
That's a little worrying though, surely? The mapping created by
kernel_physical_mapping_init() is writable, so shouldn't Xen barf if you
try and use a page within that mapping as a page table?
Cheers,
Mark.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: Don't remap the ISA region in early_ioremap()
Restore the previous behaviour of bt_ioremap() where
it would use the existing mapping of the ISA region
rather than using a fixmap.
