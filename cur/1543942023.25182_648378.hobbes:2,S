Hi, Jeff,
1. grep on the kernel source tells me that shared_vm is incremented only in
   vm_stat_account(), which is a NO-OP if CONFIG_PROC_FS is not defined.
2. How have you tested these patches? One way to do it would be to use the
   memory controller and set a small limit on the control group. A memory
   intensive application will soon see an OOM.
I do need to look at OOM kill sanity, my colleagues using the memory controller
have reported wrong actions taken by the OOM killer, but I am yet to analyze them.
The interesting thing is the use of total_vm and not the RSS which is used as
the basis by the OOM killer. I need to read/understand the code a bit more.
