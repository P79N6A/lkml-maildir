Hi,
since I switched to 2.6.15-rc2-git6, my machine is not able to suspend
anymore if my USB printer is plugged in. The problem is reproducible.
usb 1-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: USB Bidirectional printer dev 3 if 0 alt 0 proto 2 vid 0x04E8 pid 0x3242
usbcore: registered new driver usblp
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: v0.13: USB Printer Device Class driver
PM: Preparing system for mem sleep
Stopping tasks: ==================================================|
usblp 1-2:1.0: no suspend?
Could not suspend device 1-2: error -16
Some devices failed to suspend
Restarting tasks... done
Earlier kernels (2.6.14.2 and before) worked just fine.
A first search suggests this problem was introduced between
2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc2-git6. Should I try to narrow it down further?
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
