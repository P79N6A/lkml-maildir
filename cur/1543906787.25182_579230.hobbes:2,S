Yes, that's independent. The fact is, ext3 *sucks* at fsync. I hate hate 
hate it. It's totally unusable, imnsho.
The whole point of fsync() is that it should sync only that one file, and 
avoid syncing all the other stuff that is going on, and ext3 violates 
that, because it ends up having to sync the whole log, or something like 
that. So even if vim really wants to sync a small file, you end up waiting 
for megabytes of data being written out.
I detest logging filesystems.
