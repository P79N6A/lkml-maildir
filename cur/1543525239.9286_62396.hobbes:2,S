In v2.2.15pre5, (and newer), there's a device called 'Ethernet
Bonding'.  It does the above, and allows one to bond together mulitple
(up to 4) devices into one virtual device.
The only problem with this, is most switches still limit your
performance through this bonded device.  It can however, give you a
'fatter' pipe, not a 'faster' pipe.
