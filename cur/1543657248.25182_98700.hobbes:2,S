Yes, and so it doesn't fall under ptrace.  I think we're in violent agreement
here.

Fine by me.  UML has no need for manipulating pre-existing address spaces.

Yup.  As far as UML is concerned, this is all fine.  It has no need of
a PTRACE_GET_MM_FD since it creates all address spaces itself, but other
tools might.
