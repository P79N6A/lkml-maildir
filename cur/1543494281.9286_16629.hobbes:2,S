It exists, and runs, and has since 1.3.x or so, I believe.  In any
case, I've been running 64-bit Debian Linux on my Alpha since the late 
2.0.x kernel series.
There are no 32-bit binaries in 64-bit Alpha-Linux, excepting the
Intel binaries that run under em86, in which case, there is a special
kernel driver and associated userland tools for them.
