No, I never use that one because it skips very useful entries like the
ones from EXPORT_SYMBOL etc. Also, it only shows the current architecture.
So, the tags target in the Makefile would only become useful when it is
stripped of extra (unnecessary, imho) logic and turned into a plain one I
suggested above.
