I had the same problem and found out that disabling
address space randomization (echo 0 > 
/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space) solves this
reliably. With randomization enabled, I can start up
dosemu maybe 1 out of 100 times.
I guess the randomization patches changed the mapping
in a way that dosemu did not expect.
