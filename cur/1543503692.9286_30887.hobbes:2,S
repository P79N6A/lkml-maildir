Yes the machine has 256MB, I have been assuming all along that the 
problem was with the aic7xxx scsi module, which is needed on this machine and 
for which I was pointed at 
http://www.redhat.com/~dledford/aic7xxx.html
That was why I was trying to build 2.2.10 into which I could add those patches 
to see if it helped.

I have pointed it at /proc/ksyms but I just get:
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.5-22/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /boot/System.map (specified)
              -c 1 (default)
Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module 3c59x is in lsmod but not in ksyms, 
probably no symbols exported
Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module nfs is in lsmod but not in ksyms,

Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module nfsd is in lsmod but not in ksyms,

Warning: cannot match loaded module aic7xxx to any module object.  Trace may 
not be reliable.
Suggestions on making ksymoops grok these symbols?  In what other way
should I be 'pointing' it??

Thanks. I am now running the 2.2.10 kernel with the aic7xxx patches in
so I'll see how stable that appears to be.
Richard.
