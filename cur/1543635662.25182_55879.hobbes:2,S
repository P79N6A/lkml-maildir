Dumb question: Did you do a make menuconfig/config/xconfig, or just copy over 
your .config file from an old kernel?  Was a make mrproper done at any time?
When you first untar a stock kernel source tree, the "include/asm" directory 
does not exist in the tree.  When you make config/menuconfig/xconfig, an 
"include/asm" symlink gets created (among other things), linking to an 
architecture specific asm header directory like include/asm-i386 or the like.  
"make mrproper" destroys this symlink as part of the source tree cleanup.
So if you fail to do the make *config, or you do a make mrproper after your 
most recent make *config, you lose that symlink.  Thus a possible cause for 
the errors you're getting.
