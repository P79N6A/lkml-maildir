Er, to explain.
The current EVIOCGRAB does an exclusive grab that prohibits rfkill-input
and friends from working.
As it is the only way to disable the legacy input handlers,
xf86-input-evdev has been using it since we added it.
The patch is to let us cause only things that use /dev/input/event<n> to
get events, thus, a non-exclusive grab.
This basicly disables the legacy input handlers, and it's the least
invasive patch I could think of.
Going for a separate ioctl would also work, but in some ways it would
make supporting it more of a pain.
I don't care _that_ much either way, as long as we can get a way to
disable the legacy events while allowing other things to get the events
too.
