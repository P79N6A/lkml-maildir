Windows and Linux dont agree on DSACK options in some
situations, leading to symptoms you describe sometimes..
You can try echoing 0 into /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_dsack
and see if that avoids the stall (just to identify the problem,
this is not the real way to go..).
Stats and a trace would be useful..
