Subject: [PATCH] ide-scsi documentation fix (2.4.19-pre4 and 2.5.7)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In the course of a discussion on a LUG mailing list, I noticed that the
Configure.help text for CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI is incorrect.  It
indicates that you should use "hdx=scsi" on the kernel command line to
prevent devices from getting claimed by the regular IDE drivers;
actually, it should be "hdx=ide-scsi".  The incorrect documentation
exists in 2.4.19-pre4 as well as 2.5.7.  2.2 does not have the problem;
it does not state what the parameter should be.  The bootparam(7) man
page does not cover this particular command-line option.
Here is a patch for 2.4.19-pre4:
