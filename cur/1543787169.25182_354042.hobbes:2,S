I think its good to detect everything, that let a
Kernel work after the installation. I mean it the
autoconfiguration should't be only for Kernel-Hackers.
Maybe its good idea to make two type of detection
1. which detects only the HW(For Kernel-Hackers)
2. which detects all the HW and configure everything
that let the Kernel work.(for beginners)

I think it should be included, since it is up to the
user has to plug the HW in to those Ports so the
autoconfig can be detected.

All the needed HW that the user wants or need must at
least be detected and configured.

The best was is to use HW-Detection-Tools that are in
naked Kernel. But I dont know if is lspci is in the
Kernel. I mean dmidecode is good for detecting all the
HW but it has to be installed first. And its no good
to let the user install first of all some tools so the
autoconfigure can work.
How do we get the HW detected from a naked Kernel
without any Distrubotion or whatever.

If something like that hapend we can put a filter in
the script, that changes the Parameter in to a new
one.

I dont understand your question. What you mean with
interfaces??
