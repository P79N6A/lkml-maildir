Note that git applymbox can (and normally does) take the date in regular 
RFC 822 email format too, so it's really git format-patch that is the 
culprit here. It _could_ try to turn it back into a regular date, but just 
uses the git internal format because it's easy, lazy, and unambigious.
The easy and lazy parts are probably not very strong arguments. The 
unambigious part is the thing that makes it a killer format.
