Btw, i think that drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c:e1000_down() is buggy.
It calls del_timer_sync(&adapter->watchdog_timer), but e1000_watchdog()
calls schedule_work(e1000_watchdog_task), so the work could be queued
after del_timer_sync().
And e1000_watchdog_task() arms timers again.
Note that it's not enough to do flush_scheduled_work() here.
Oleg.
