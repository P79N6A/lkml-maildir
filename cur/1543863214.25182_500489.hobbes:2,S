If it actually has 256*2^20 bytes, why advertise it as "256 MiB" when "268.4
MB" is equally valid and looks better? It really comes down to this: is it
your position that "256 MB" can only correctly mean 256 million bytes?
If you are right, a "512MB" RAM stick is mislabelled and is more correctly
labelled as "536.8MB". (With 512MiB being equally correct.)
Isn't that obviously not just wrong but borderline crazy? Yes, your position
has some nice consequences, but that doesn't allow you to ignore the bad
ones.
Unfortunately, we're not writing on a clean slate here.
