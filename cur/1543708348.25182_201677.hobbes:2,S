There are way too many clocks, none of which are good.

OK, this is pointing right at the problem.
Linux does not record process start times at all.
Instead, it records the number of clock ticks
from boot until the process starts.
Either the boot time or current time is real.
The other may be computed from the uptime, which
may be measured in clock ticks.
The clock doesn't tick when your laptop sleeps.
I seem to recall recent changes to the way the
boot time in /proc/stat gets reported. In any
case, a sleeping laptop suggests some interesting
questions about process run times.
Here's another one to make you scream: Linux does
not supply real %CPU data.
