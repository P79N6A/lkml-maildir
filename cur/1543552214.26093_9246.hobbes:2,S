I wish ;-)  That was a real bug, you just found a second one.
For highmem pages, set_bh_page() sets bh->b_data to (char *)0 + offset.
Based on this, I don't think it is legal for highmem pages to be used here.
Guys, what am I missing?  reiserfs is using GFP_BUFFER on kmallocs except
for the bitmaps, and during journal replay (I'm fixing both of those
spots).  It looks like this BUG is coming from accessing bh->b_data from a
page in the page cache.
