It is not really the same - the app is not trying to
create an "executable" file on a noexec filesystem.
PROT_EXEC never required the exec permission on a file
btw. The MAP_PRIVATE mmap roughly means a read of the
file into the memory, where the program can do anything
with its data, including an execution. Does the R/O
filesystem disallow PROT_WRITE for MAP_PRIVATE? Haven't
tried, but I hope it doesn't.
