This last statement seems to contradict with what GCC manual says about
volatile asm statements:
"You can prevent an `asm' instruction from being deleted by writing the
keyword `volatile' after the `asm'. [...]
The `volatile' keyword indicates that the instruction has important
side-effects.  GCC will not delete a volatile `asm' if it is reachable.
(The instruction can still be deleted if GCC can prove that
control-flow will never reach the location of the instruction.)  *Note
that even a volatile `asm' instruction can be moved relative to other
code, including across jump instructions.*"
I think that volatile memory locations aren't compiler barriers either,
-- GCC only guarantees that it won't remove the access and that it won't
re-arrange the access w.r.t. other *volatile* accesses. On the other
hand, barrier() indeed prevents *any* memory access from being moved
across the barrier.
