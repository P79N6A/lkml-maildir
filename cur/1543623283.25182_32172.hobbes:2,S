This page of statistics is pretty gnifty -- I wish more people posted
such :)
I also like your other comparisons at the top of that link...  I was
thinking, what would be even more neat and more useful as well would be
to post comparisons -between- the various kernels you have tested, i.e.
a single page that includes benchmarks for 2.4.x-official,
2.5.x-official, -aa, -rmap, etc.
Regards,
	Jeff
