   I see no reason why turning on NAPI should make the Apache setup
   we have perform worse ... quite the opposite. Yes, we could use
   Tux, yes we'd get better results. But that's not the point ;-)
Of course.
I just don't want propaganda being spread that using Tux means you
lose any sort of web server functionality whatsoever.
