Ok and right after I sent this my brain returned from vacation and I 
remembered jejb's DMA allocation API.  It's powerful enough to cover most 
driver use cases I think (users of GFP_DMA should probably be converted), 
but for example block layer bounce buffering might need a different 
interface as I see you've proposed in another mail.
Hm... s390 driver seem to like GFP_DMA a lot...  and there are a few 
remaining uses in drivers/scsi... and then of course there are the OSS 
drivers...
