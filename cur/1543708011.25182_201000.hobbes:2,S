Thanks a lot !
I've had this problem for about a year, making it impossible to load a
full fluidr3 sound font at once. I've searched for the cause of the problem,
but didn't find anything and concluded that it should have been a hardware
limitation, which in fact was not !
Great catch !
Cheers,
Willy
