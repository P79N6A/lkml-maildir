I just looked over the patches and Mauro's response shortly, Mauro
just wrote that your patch leaves undefined symbols. That way Mauro
won't commit any patches, nevermind if the patch comes from you or
someone else.
I'll have a closer look at what your patch causes tonight, afterwards
I can say more about it.
If these symbols aren't needed you might insert dummy functions which
print that the real implementation isn't compiled into the kernel
(dvb_attach does it that way)
Some of your mails only contain 10% information about what you really
want to solve please cut out the private abusive stuff. The people you
judge here contributed alot during the last years, it probably
wouldn't even be possible to compile the whole project that easy if
these people wouldn't have done all that work for everyone.
2.6.21 won't be the last kernel out there, the right place to fix that
problem is the v4l-dvb repository on linuxtv.org first.
