Subject: [PATCH] 5/6 i386 non-reversible-fs-gs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/30/6

Subtle fix:  load_TLS has been moved after saving %fs and %gs segments to
avoid creating non-reversible segments.  This could conceivably cause a bug
if the kernel ever needed to save and restore fs/gs from the NMI handler.
It currently does not, but this is the safest approach to avoiding fs/gs
corruption.  SMIs are safe, since SMI saves the descriptor hidden state.
Diffs against: patch-2.6.13-rc4 + cpu-inline-cleanup + dt-inline-cleanup
