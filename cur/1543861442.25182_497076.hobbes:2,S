Hi Takada-san,
It is  obviously bad.
These part is added several years ago by my post.
A cyrix.c try to find chip because of chip hardware bug affected
to timer which has started early.
Now, these chips have already been obsolete.
There are 2 options. One is simply remove these functionality.
The other is to move it to compile time ifdef that is off by default.
For user who use in embbeded environment,
I wanna change it to ifdef.
Thank you for report!
Hiroshi
