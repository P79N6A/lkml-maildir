It well call get_legacy_serial_ports() which is hopefully exported by
the arch code.

Hrm... ok. Or adding a #ifdef __KERNEL__ (sic !) :)
I'll send you a new patch later today as I had to do another fix, we
tend to "force" register_console() apparently even when we have nothing
to register because we set the "ops" to all ports even those who were
never configured and we test "ops" to decide wether to succeed or fail
in the console setup() callback.
