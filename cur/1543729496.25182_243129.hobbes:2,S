Both points are valid; it should retry in-kernel for the pte lock bit
and arrange to use a bit not used for swap (there are at least
PAGE_SHIFT of these on all 64-bit arches).

It also protects against vma tree modifications in mainline, but rmap.c
shouldn't need it for vmas anymore, as the vma is rooted to the spot by
mapping->i_shared_lock for file pages and anon_vma->lock for anonymous.

Fortunately, spare bits aren't strictly necessary, and neither is
cmpxchg. A single invalid value can serve in place of a bitflag. When
using such an invalid value, just xchg()'ing it and looping when the
invalid value is seen should suffice. This holds more generally for all
radix trees, not just pagetables, and happily xchg() or emulation
thereof is required by core code for all arches.
