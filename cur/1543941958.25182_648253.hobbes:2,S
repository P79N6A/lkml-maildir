The above implies that the patch was authored by Cliff.

And the "I" here implies that the patch was authored by Cliff.

But the signoffs imply that Paul was the author.
I'm going to assume it was Paul.
We indicate authorship by putting a "From: foo <bar@zot.com>" at the very
first line of the changelog.  If that is absent then we use the From: from email
headers.
Please remember to do this - it is more reliable than akpm forensics.
