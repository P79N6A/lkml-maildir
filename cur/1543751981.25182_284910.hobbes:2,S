I would say that a sample space (omega) of one unique element cannot be 
considered entirely random. For that if you perform the random 
experiment, you will always get that unique sample, and thus p(Sample) 
= p(Omega) = 1.
Let Omega = { 0 }, thus p(Omega) = p(0) = 1, which I wouldn't consider 
random at all.
