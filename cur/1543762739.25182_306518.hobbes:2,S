Drivers can add (e.g. in ->probe) attributes for devices using
extern int device_create_file(struct device *device, struct device_attribute
* entry);
and delete them (e.g. in ->remove) using
extern void device_remove_file(struct device * dev, struct device_attribute
* attr);
and there's also 
extern int driver_create_file(struct device_driver *, struct
driver_attribute *);
extern void driver_remove_file(struct device_driver *, struct
driver_attribute *);
