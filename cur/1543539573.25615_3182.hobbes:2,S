Are you sure they're reversed?  :q in vi doesn't write out the current
file, after all -- you have to do :wq for that.   I was modeling the
behavior on Berkeley mail.

Hm.  How did you manage to get a Python with tkinter configured out?
All the distributions I know about have it in thestock version.

False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for
one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because
it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils
except destruction.  The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of
such a nature.  They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined
to commit crimes.
