Be careful -- older gcc versions tend to abort for inline asm
that clobbers too many registers. Especially when the register
is already used (like ebp in a frame pointer enabled kernel) 
Make sure it at least works on the oldest supported gcc version 
(gcc 3.2) and with frame pointer on.
For asms with so many clobbers explicit push/pop is usually safer.
