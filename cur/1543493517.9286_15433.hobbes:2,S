Why should not ELF executable be allowed to say "Well, I do not know
what I would do with RAW_PORT_ACCESS capability, so I do not want to
get that capability. Take it away from me". Every executable can say
this, btw, at beggining of main. I do not see why saying it in
executable headers is different.

PS: And yes, it makes a difference because by putting it in headers
you can _check_ if it drops capability properly.
