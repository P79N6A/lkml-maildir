if I recall they have to munch through the whole of /proc to get this 
information; then again there is probably a clean and fast way of pulling 
those time values from /proc that I do not know of.

its all a case of trade-offs and of course everyones millage will vary.  For
me I want the CPU to slowly get faster and faster as a task might complete
fast enough without vamping it up to 100%.  Then again Con will probably
point out "pah, then the difference in battery saving is negligable" :)
On a laptop (regardless of whether it gives an overall order of magnitude
power saving or not) I would prefer the cpu speed to be as low as possible.  
Again everyone (well here in the UK) I chat to seems to prefer the slow 
increasing method which many of the userspace tools try to do anyway; then of 
course the argument "userland userland userland....".

I thought a few people would grumble about that.  I needed a way to store the 
variable speed knob and that struct was the best place for it; looks like me 
tarting it up as a 'debugging' feature was not good enough :)
