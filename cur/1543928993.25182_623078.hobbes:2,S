Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.24: restore missing sysfs max_cstate attr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Len, is there any good reason why max_cstate was made invisible in 2.6.24,
breaking my userspace scripts that access it?
Here's a patch to fix the regression from 2.6.23:
Restore visibility of /sys/module/processor/parameters/max_cstate 
for compatibility with kernels prior to 2.6.24.
I have scripts here that rely upon it.

Patch is against 2.6.24-rc3-git5.
