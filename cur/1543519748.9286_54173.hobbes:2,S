this is false. We wake up any newly created thread, which means that we
immediately send a cross-CPU message to any potential idle CPU to run this
new thread. I've just measured this on pre1-2.3.34 - we start running the
newly created thread within 15 microseconds _on another CPU_ after it got
created.
