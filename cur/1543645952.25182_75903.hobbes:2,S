Hi,
as requested by "make menuconfig" when it crahed out from under me, a 
report on the error it generated.
kernel to be configured: 2.5.40, unmodified from kernel.org
section: ALSA configuration
error: ./script/Menuconfig: MCmenu74: command not found
running system: Dual Athlon 1900 with SMP 2.4.19 kernel (slackware 8.1)
Cheers,
Rudy
