Please put it back, minus the hooks so the rest of the world can use it.
If not please remove every line of code I've even written because I
don't like the new attitude .. so ner..
Point made ? We can't go around throwing out drivers because the author
had a tantrum. Its also trivial to move the decompressor to user space
where it should be anyway. Similarly the driver is useful without the
binary stuff.
Or do we need a -ac tree again where this time -ac is "added camera" ;)
