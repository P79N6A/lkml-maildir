Ick.  That takes the prize for the highest BKL contention I've ever 
seen, except for some horribly contrived torture tests of mine.  I've 
had data like this sent to me a few times to analyze and the only 
thing I've been able to suggest up to this point is not to use ext3.

I really doubt that dropping in lock_journal will help this case very 
much.  Every single kernel_flag entry in the lockmeter output where 
Util > 0.00% is caused by ext3.  The schedule entry is probably caused 
by something in ext3 grabbing BKL, getting scheduled out for some 
reason, then having it implicitly released in schedule().  The 
schedule() contention comes from the reacquire_kernel_lock().
We used to see plenty of ext2 BKL contention, but Al Viro did a good 
job fixing that early in 2.5 using a per-inode rwlock.  I think that 
this is the required level of lock granularity, another global lock 
just won't cut it.
