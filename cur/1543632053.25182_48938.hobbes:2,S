Condensing the patch summary into one line is a tough thing to do.  I
try to just mention the subsystem and specific driver (if any) on the
first line, and then go into the necessary detail on the following
lines.  That way if someone's interested in that specific subsystem or
driver, they can easily search and then later get more detail if they
want to.  Sound good?
thanks,
