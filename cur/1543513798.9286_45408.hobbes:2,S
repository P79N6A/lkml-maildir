2.95.x works fine, a lot of Debian itself is compiled with it. It's
just the kernel that should not be compiled with 2.95.x, but Debian
has a "gcc272" package for exactly this purpose. You do need to edit
the kernels main Makefile and change
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
to
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc272 -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
I wonder why it's not simply
CC      :=$(CROSS_COMPILE)$(CC) -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
.. so that you can do "make CC=gcc272".. oh well.
Mike.
