In 2.4.0-test1-ac15 my USB printer worked. In test2, test5-pre4, test5 and
test6pre5 it no longer works by default and once trying to use it syslogd will
fill /var/log/messages until disk full. The message is (test6-pre5):
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: registered new driver hub
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: registered new driver usb-storage
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: USB Mass Storage support registered.
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: registered new driver usblp
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin D of device 00:07.2. Probably buggy MP table.
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: uhci.c: found UHCI device with no IRQ assigned. check BIOS settings!
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: deregistering driver usblp
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: deregistering driver usb-storage
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: deregistering driver usbdevfs
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: deregistering driver hub
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus insmod: /lib/modules/2.4.0-x7/usb/uhci.o: init_module: Operation not permitted
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus insmod: /lib/modules/2.4.0-x7/usb/uhci.o: insmod char-major-180 failed
Aug  5 16:21:27 iapetus kernel: usb.c: registered new driver usbdevfs
...and on and on. Every 30 seconds there are two attempts.
The continuous filling might be caused by lpd continuing to try to print.
It worked again once BIOS was reconfigured to
	Assign IRQ for USB: enabled.
Everything is a module here. hardware is SMP.
/etc/modules.conf (after stripping a lot of path= and other):
	# first load all usb drivers, then the core stuff
	below uhci		printer usb-storage
	alias char-major-180	uhci
