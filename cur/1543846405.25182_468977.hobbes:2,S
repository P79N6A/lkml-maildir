While strongly agreeing with the above reasoning, I'd just
 point out that the two current reports were
 mine -> FC5, in-kernel ipw2200, wpa_supplicant and wireless-tools "too old",
   rebuild userspace from recent sources => all fine and dandy
 Norbert's -> Debian unstable, out-of-kernel ipw3945, wpa_supplicant okay,
   wireless-tools "too old", rebuild these from recent sources =>
still a few issues
 so it was only myself running FC5, and with a WE-21 capable Torvalds kernel
 as I test at least 4 -git snapshots per week (and yes, 2.6.18 doesn't
have WE-21,
 which is the root of the reports - WE-21 went in in 2.6.18-git9).
Indeed the in-kernel driver appeared to be the easily solved case, as
expected...
Thanks, ciao,
