Hello everyone!
> I unable to boot due to a kernel oops on my D845GLVA.  This

I've got the same problem here. Did an make oldconfig from a 2.4.26 
config, booted and the systems made an oops.
Problem is, that the system is production and I can't test, where the 
problem is in special. We had two reboots already and even that is 
nearly too much.
Best regards
Kai
