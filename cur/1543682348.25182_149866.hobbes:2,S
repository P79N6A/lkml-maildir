Two reasons:
 - I'm using uClibc, not glibc. uClibc doesn't have a fixed copy
   of the kernel headers. Everything builds fine with real kernel
   headers from both 2.4.x and 2.6.x, except for this small glitch.
 - If we fix it now, the glibc guys will have one less patch to
   apply when they update their copy.
The glibc-kernelheaders package exists only because the glibc
people cannot afford to work-around every single quirk in any
version of the kernel.
And if you often build system utilities you'll find out there is
quite a lot of userland code out there with legitimate reasons
for including kernel headers. Some examples: strace, nfsutils,
psutils, quota.
