Looking at bat_mapin_ram, it looks like we only map the first 512MB of
RAM with BATs, so we actually map the 512MB - 768MB range with PTEs
(and highmem starts at 768MB).  Two of the DBATs are used by I/O
mappings, so that only leaves two DBATs of 256MB each to map lowmem
anyway.  Am I missing something?
By the way, does the "nobats" option currently work on PowerMac?
