Subject: [PATCH] fix select() for SOCK_RAW sockets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/7/77

Phil: Here's a real patch for you to test.  I actually left inet_dgram_ops
alone since it's an exported symbol (two of the users just want the .do_ioctl
value which is the same between SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW; the other is ipv6
where it's clearly dealing with a UDP socket -- therefore I think its safest
to leave inet_dgram_ops to have the UDP behavior)
Davem: I only tested that this doesn't break UDP; if it works for Phil and
Stephen can verify that it doesn't break his bad-checksum UDP tests then
please push it for 2.6.10.
Patch is versus 2.6.10-rc3.
