No matter what we do with cpufreq, cpufreq needs to protect itself against 
the cpu going away. I am not too confident about the long term viability of the
implicit callback order-based locking. Sooner or later, someone
will add another complex per-cpu subsystem with calls to another
per-cpu subsystem and will violate locking order between the two
subsystems.
IMO, the right thing to do would be to convert lock_cpu_hotplug() to
a get_cpu_hotplug()/put_cpu_hotplug() type semantics and use a more
scalable implementation underneath (as opposed to a global
semaphore/mutex).
We have had some discussion on taking a look at the overall design
of the cpufreq and its cpu drivers themselves, but we need
solve this issue in the short term.
Thanks
