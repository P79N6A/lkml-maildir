As I mentioned in the previous e-mail, the GEODEGX1 define as it stands
is incorrect - the cache line size should be 16 bytes for the GX1.  The 
GX and LX share a newer core, so it stands, I think that they should have
a different define.

The jury is still out on that.  Certainly, optimizing for i586 architectures
is incorrect, because the pipelining is different then on a Pentium machine
(i586 optimized code is much slower, especially in userland).  I don't have
any solid numbers on the performance of just -mmx or -3dnow, but my gut 
feeling from months of use is that the performance isn't any worse, at least.  
I suppose that I should come with something more solid then a gut feeling, 
though, substantial as my gut may be.
