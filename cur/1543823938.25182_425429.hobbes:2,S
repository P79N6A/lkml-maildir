Over all I could speed up just half of the calls because I cannot write
in /proc/<pid>/mem !
You are proposing a solution which speeds up writes but not reads.
(from fs/proc/base.c)
#define mem_write NULL
#ifndef mem_write
/* This is a security hazard */
static ssize_t mem_write(struct file * file, const char * buf,
       size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
....
#endif
My proposals should not add any threats which is not already in 
PTRACE_POKEDATA. Now, either the threat do currently exist and my
proposed patch makes is exploitable in a faster way, or it did not
exist and it still does not exist.
PTRACE_MULTI just executes several ptrace requests in a single call.
Other projects would benefit from a similar patch:
see: www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/doc/parrot-agm2003.pdf 
http://www.cse.nd.edu/~dthain/papers/ibox-sc05.pdf
They had the very same problem.
