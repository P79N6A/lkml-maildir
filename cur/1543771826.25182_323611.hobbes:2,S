Ugh ? You don't know, thus you can't assume it's working. A rule of the
device model is, once you have been suspended, you can't assume your
parent is still there and thus that you can talk to your device. On ppc
or embedded, the arch has ways to shut down clocks and/or power to
entire bus segment and that may have happened anytime.

I know, but there may be arch thingies going on anyway. So the basic
"model" of turning back the chip on is wrong.

No. just return IRQ_NONE. That is the only sane thing to do.

No. That specific bit can be easily fixed for PCI drivers like that.
Just return IRQ_NONE, you shouldn't be emitting any IRQ yourself anyway.

No need.

Well, if we have told the chip not to issue interrupts, then it's safe
to just have the handler return IRQ_NONE... we don't even need to
unregister the handler. (That's actually equivalent to some regard).
To not be racy, the best is to synchronize though. Something like this
pseudo code:
suspend():
  1) chip_disable_irq(); /* disable emission of IRQs on the chip,
                          * maybe do that & below in a spinlock_irq
                          * to make sure no other driver code path
                          * re-enables them
                          */
  2) me->sleeping = 1;  /* tells the rest of the driver I'm not there
                         * anymore, can be some netif_* thingy.
                         */
  3) synchronize_irq(me->irq); /* make sure above is visible to IRQs and
                                * any pending one competes on another
                                * CPU
                                */
  4) pci_set_power_state(), maybe free_irq(), etc...
my_irq_handler():
  if (me->sleeping)
    return IRQ_NONE;
That's it.
Ben.
