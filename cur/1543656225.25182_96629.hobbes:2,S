I haven't any problems yet, as I haven't bought the modem yet. I don't
want to if it is going to give me problems.
The 1.4 version of the driver (before integration into 2.5 series
kernel), is supposed to not work with SMP kernels (that's why I asked
in the first place). So I contacted the author (Johan Verrept) to ask on the status,
and he said he thought it was probably OK now, as it was in the 2.5
kernel.
So I grabbed the 2.5.51 sources and looked at the see, and could see
no mention of a change to fix SMP. So I then contacted Richard Purdie,
who was the last person to make a change to the source. He said he
didn't know.
So, is anyone using it on SMP?
