Subject: sky2 driver causes kernel crash as of 2.6.18.1

I have been compiling kernels from 2.6.16.16 on to see if there is any 
improvement
in the Sky2 driver. The most recent official kernel version, 2.6.18.1, 
as of 10/31/06
seems to still have problems.
The crash debug splat indicates that the transmit routine was being 
executed when
the final crash occured. But before the crash there were a series of 
diagnostics from
the driver:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth4: transmit time out
sky2 eth4: tx timeout
sky2 hardware hung? flushing
messages.
Is there any better driver in a 'unstable' kernel that someone has 
tested sufficiently?
Thanks
John Clark
