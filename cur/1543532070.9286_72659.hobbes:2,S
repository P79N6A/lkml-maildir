I don't know, and I'm not sure where to find out.  I just remember (barely) SystemV
stuff from an end-user (not admin nor development) side.  I'm just 30...I mean, I
was in High School when this came out, and my "end-user" experience, was just a
little earlier than that.
I figured it was quicker just to get the network connected on something I knew how
to change--Linux, and use Linux as a router to the "real" file server--Novell.  I
used the workstation to mount an export on the Linux box, then that same mount
point was mounted to Novell.  Let Novell or NT do that!!!  :-)
Any idea on the iBCS error?  I'm really interested in getting this to run under
Linux, unfortunately I do not have access to the sources.  The company, Amada,
won't support the software anymore (not even on Interactive's OS) much less
anything new, so I have nothing to lose by trying "strange" things.
