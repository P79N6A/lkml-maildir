Hmm, it looks like it's this line in tcp_print_conntrack()
return sprintf(buffer, "%s ", tcp_conntrack_names[state]);
But it would be good if you could recompile and use addr2line (or gdb)
to get the exact line (offsets and memory-addresses depends on compiler
used and other stuff).
I took a quick look at the code but didn't see anything obvious.
