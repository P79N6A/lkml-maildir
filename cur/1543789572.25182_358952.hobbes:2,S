Oh.  Then I'm still not understanding.

For starters, we don't actually _use_ pte's for the hugepage.  We use an
entry in a pmd page.  Does that concept still apply for ia64?
If so, are you saying that the hardware prefetching is happening at the pmd
level?  If not, how can it happen at the pte level when the hardware
doesn't know where the pte page _is_?
Has this problem been observed in testing?

Is an mmap of a hugepage region very common?  I guess it is, on ia32, or on
64-bit apps which are (poorly?) designed to also run on ia32.

I still don't understand what's different about hugepages here.  If the
prefetching problem also occurs on regular pages and is handled OK for
regular pages, why do hugepages need special treatment?
