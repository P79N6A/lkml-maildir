Hi,
Could you please boot with "i8042.debug log_buf_len=131072" boot
option, work touchpad a bit and send me your full dmesg (or
/var/log/messages), please?
I the meantime to get your touchpad working (after you send me the
dmesg) add "psmouse.proto=exps" to your boot options (or add "options
psmouse proto=exps" if psmouse is compiled as a module).
