My patch was against the -mm series, as reported in
the original subject.
In the -mm series, the perfctr-ppc.patch already
defines that symbol. As that patch contains all the
perfctr related bits, it made sense to remove the
definition coming from the Linus tree and keep the
definition from the perfctr-ppc.patch. But just on
-mm.
Cheers,
Albert
