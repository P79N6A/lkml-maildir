I think Mike has a patch queued up that takes advantage of the class
code, which might address all of these issues.  Mike?

I don't understand the "shared and overridden" aspect.  Do you mean a
default attribute for all types of SCSI devices, with the ability for an
individual device to override the attribute with it's own values if it
wants to?  That still seems doable within the driver model today,
without having to rely on bus specific functions.
Hm, this is _really_ calling for what Pat calls "attributes".  Take a
look at the ones in the class model, and let me know if those would work
for you for devices.  If so, I'll be glad to add them, which should help
you out here.
Hope this helps,
