I don't understand what you mean. This is true whether you pulled (a) or 
not. If you have any changes what-so-ever in your tree, if you pull in 
fixes from my tree, you'll get a merge.
But if you mean that you cannot rebase (a), then yes. That was what I 
said. Rebases *do*not*work* (and fundamentally cannot work) in a 
distributed environment.
But why would you merge with my tree in the first place? My tree won't 
normally have any conflicts or anything like that anyway.
With a "Linux-next" tree, you'll see the conflicts if they occur (since 
*that* tree would merge!), and in that case you would say  "now I need to 
merge Linus' tree just to resolve the conflicts!"
But before that, merging my tree (or rebasing on top of it) is simply 
*wrong*. It has nothing to do with your SCSI development.

I don't see the logic. You shouldn't need to rebase at all. I don't see 
why you claim that this makes rebasing more of a fact. It doesn't. It has 
no impact at all, except making rebasing _less_ possible!
