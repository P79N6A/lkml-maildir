Well, they _are_ views.  We have two distinct objects - superblock (fs
tree itself) and vfsmount (view into it).  Some of the flags obviously
belong to the latter (e.g. nosuid, nodev and noexec - in -ac they are
per-mountpoint and in effect you can turn them on and off on arbitrary
subtrees - e.g.
mount --bind /home/k1dd13 /home/k1dd13
mount -o remount,noexec /home/k1dd13
will have expected effect).
Read-only is more complex - in addition to mount side ("does anyone want
it to be r/w") there is a filesystem side ("does fs agree to be r/w")...
