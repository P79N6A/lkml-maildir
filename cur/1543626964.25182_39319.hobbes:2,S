Bollox!
There are many places in the kernel that are actually very OO - look at
filesystems for example. The super_operations sturcture is in effect a
virtual function table.
Sure making every file an object is probably OTT; but large scale things
like a filesystem, a network device or the like probably actually fit
very well.
Sure, there are a lot of features of C++ to stay clear of - exception
handling probably being one of them, and I wouldn't let the C++ stuff
anywhere near the memory management code.
Point being that it is a case of using the write tool for the job.  C++
douesn't add any extra overhead just by calling it C++ and not using any
of the features; careful use of the features where appropriate does no
harm and might actually make the code cleaner, and possibly more
efficient.
I will agree going head in and just throwing C++ at it is a bad thing.
