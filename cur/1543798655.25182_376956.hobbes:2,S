Throughout the past two years of 4k stack-wars, I never heard why
such a small stack was needed (not wanted, needed). It seems that
everybody "knows" that smaller is better and most everybody thinks
that one page in ix86 land is "optimum". However I don't think
anybody ever even tried to analyze what was better from a technical
perspective. Instead it's been analyzed as religious dogma, i.e.,
keep the stack small, it will prevent idiots from doing bad things.
I'm fairly sure that if you started from scratch and decided to
write a new operating system, your choice of a stack-size would
probably be something like 64k. I have no clue why somebody
decided to use a 4k stack and force their choice upon others.
And, yes, I am well aware that each system-call requires a
seperate stack upon entry and it even needs to keep that stack
while sleeping.
Cheers,
