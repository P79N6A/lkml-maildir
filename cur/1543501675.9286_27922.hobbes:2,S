I understand that work on a new PnP / bus management architecture has
started...  That is nice.
Are you also intending to do the other changes suggested when this last
came up?  (We also said that module loading should be separated from
device initialization, and some protocol should exist to allow the bus
driver to tell the driver what resources to use...)  This protocol will
also solve Tim's problem, as the driver will _know_ beforehand that it has
an 8-byte io range...
