Subject: [PATCH 0/6] PCI-X/PCI-Express read control interfaces
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch set adds hooks to set PCI-X max read request size
and PCI-Express read request size. It is important that this be a PCI
subsystem function rather than a per device hack. That way, the PCI
system quirks can be used if needed.
