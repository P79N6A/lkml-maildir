I just love the way you propose insanely hard-to-get-right, hard-to- 
understand, and complicated interfaces with known broken cases you admit  
to, to replace simple, obviously correct and race-free mechanisms, all  
with a supposed goal to make things simpler and safer.
Is there some fancy word to describe something that looks like irony,  
sarcasm, or satire, except for the fact it's actually meant entirely  
seriously?
