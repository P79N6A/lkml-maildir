I'll put a patch together for consideration.

That's something like putting them all in their own sub-directory, but
sounds less clean to me.

We already have something like that in place, actually.
When you mount the legacy "cpuset" filesystem, it just passes through
to the cgroup filesystem with the mount options "cpuset,noprefix",
i.e. mount a cgroups hierarcy with just cpusets bound to it, and
*don't* prefix subsystem control files with the subsystem name. It
wouldn't be hard to also have a "nosubdir" mount option that keeps the
existing single-level style, have the cpuset filessytem pass that
option.
