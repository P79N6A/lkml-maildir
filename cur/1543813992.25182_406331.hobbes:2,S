Thanks for looking at it. Yeah in the intro I say that I'm considering
a simplified radix-tree (without tags or gang lookups) to start with.
At the end I say how tags are handled... it isn't quite clear enough
for my liking yet though.
Intro and conclusion - yes they should be better. It _is_ a chapter from
a larger document, however I want it to still stand alone as a good
document.
What happens is: read-side tag operations (ie. tag lookups etc) are done
under lock. Ie. they are not made lockless.

Yep, lockless reads only to start with. I think you'll see some benefit
because the read(2) and ->nopage paths also take read-side locks, so your
write side will no longer have to contend with them.
It won't be a huge improvement in scalability though, maybe just a constant
factor.

Yeah this is the next step. Note that it is not the first step because I
actually want to _speed up_ single threaded lookup paths, rather than
slowing them down, otherwise it will never get accepted.
It also might add quite a large amount of complexity to the radix tree, so
it may no longer be suitable for a generic data structure anymore (depends
how it is implemented). But the write side should be easier than the
read-side so I don't think there is too much to worry about. I already have
some bits and pieces to make it fine-grained.
