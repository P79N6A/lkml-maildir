The situation I described and you've quoted in the bulk of the above

What I'm referring to is the pre-CPU hotplug SMP initialisation
methodology and the post-CPU hotplug SMP initialisation methodology,
which I think is covered by "two different SMP initialisation
methodologies".
The two methodologies had entirely different ways of bringing up the
non-boot CPUs to the extent of using the cpu_*_map variables in different
ways.  However, now that I come to look again at x86, the situation does
appear to have improved somewhat over the last year or so since I last
looked (which was when I sorted out the ARM SMP support.)
