Frank,
You raise two important issues:
1. code markers/annotations for tracing/probing purposes.
2. overhead of the kernel loggers in their inactive state
Of these, I think the first is more important, as it addresses some 
basic defeciency of software development --- getting to know someone 
else's code.
In my experience, writing instrumentation for a kernel subsystem (schema 
in Klogger lingo) requires in depth understanding of the code. This 
sometimes tunnel tremendous efforts towards measurements that could 
otherwise become trivial.
Since no one knows the code like its coder, having developers annotate 
their code using some semi-formal language/definitions (or even compiler 
pragmas) can serve as the best basis for any kernel logger.
Once such markers are in place, the second issue --- overheads (as most 
anything else)--- becomes a technical issue. So even when incurring 
inactive overheads, such a tool can be very useful for developers and 
researchers alike.
After all my babble, the bottom line to the community:
will kernel developers annotate their code? can such policies be instated?
