I must be able to build kernel modules for a kernel version that I
am not yet running. This is not related in any way to what I get from
`uname -r`. Further, I may be building the kernel for an Alpha on
an Intel machine, using a cross-compiler.
The de-facto standard has been that /usr/src/linux is a sym-link to
the kernel version you wish to build. Why is this expected to be
changed?
Since this is a symbolic link, it can cross device boundaries. This
makes it very versatile.
 /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm are symbolic links, referenced
to /usr/src/linux, not a specific version. This makes changing kernel
development versions a simple change of a single symbolic link.
Why would anybody change this? I fear that this is another of those;
"It doesn't have to be better, only different..." things that have
been going around.
Cheers,
