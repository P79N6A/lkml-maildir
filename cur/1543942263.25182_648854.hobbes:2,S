Each RQ always has a reference to one root-domain and is thus represented by the rd->refcount.  When the last RQ drops its reference to a particular instance, we free the structure.  So this is the only place where we clean up, but it should also be the only place we need to (unless I am misunderstanding you?)
Note that there is one exception: the default root-domain is never freed, which is why we initialize it with a refcount = 1.  So it is theoretically possible to have this particular root-domain dangling with no RQs associated with it, but that is by design.
