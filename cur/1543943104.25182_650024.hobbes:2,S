Can you post a delta against my versoin? I do not see any changes from
a quick glance.
This is probably more acceptable version of beep; but there are
probably even better ways to clean it...
        if (wakeup_header.realmode_flags & 4) {
                inb(97);
                outb(0, 0x80);
                outb(3, 97);
                outb(0, 0x80);
                outb(-74, 67);
                outb(0, 0x80);
                outb(-119, 66);
                outb(0, 0x80);
                outb(15, 66);
        }
...like the version that makes beep/pause/beep/pause, so that user can
count them.
