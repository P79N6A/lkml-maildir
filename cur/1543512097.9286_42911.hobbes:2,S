I've noticed PPP uploads going slowly on 2.2.12 and 2.2.13pre8 (these
being the only two kernels I've tried since the modem's been connected
directly to this box), accompanied by the "CS" light on the modem
flickering off for a short (.5 sec?) period of time.
Haven't ruled out the other possibilites though (dodgy ISP, dodgy
connection, dodgy modem...)
Kernels 2.2.12, 2.2.13p8
pppd 2.3 patchlevel 5 (hacked-around rh5.2 system)
