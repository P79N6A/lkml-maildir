Subject: [PATCH] make ide-dma compile in 2.5.4-pre2, woops

Hi,
A minor slip up on my behalf broke ide-dma compile in 2.5.4-pre2 due to
the scatterlist ->address removal. This patch should make it work again,
but please not that it is NOT a good example for follow for folks trying
to fixup other drivers due to address breakage...
scatterlist building for a task file ioctl will be moved to be unified
with regular bio sglist building instead of the current nasty hack
soonish.
