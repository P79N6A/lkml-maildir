device names are not safer then partition labels. One reason
is that they name changes , while partition labels never change,
except if the admin does it on purpose. Examples when a device name
for a partition changes are : deleting/adding partitions on the 
same disk, adding/removing disks on the same bus, adding/removing
HD controllers in the system ...
