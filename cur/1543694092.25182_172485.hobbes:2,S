Ok, I can now build it but I have to hardcode _my_ include directories in the
Makefile like:
/home/markh/work2/pcirtom_tst/driver/Makefile:
EXTRA_CFLAGS = -I/home/markh/work2/pcirtom_tst/include/linux/sys
-I/home/markh/work2/pcirtom_tst/include/linux
-I/home/markh/work2/pcirtom_tst/include
ifneq   ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
        obj-m   += rtom.o
else
        KDIR    := /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
        PWD     := $(shell pwd)
default:
        $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
endif
My driver tree looks like
driver/
include/
diags/
samples/
library/
I've also tried setting the EXTRA_CFLAGS var in the top makefile but it doesn't
seem to get passed down when the driver is compiled?? I've also tried creating a
link in the driver directory pointing back to the include dir and adjusting the
paths in the EXTRA_CFLAGS to 
-Iinclude/linux/sys -Iinclude/linux -Iinclude to no avail.
Thanks
Mark
