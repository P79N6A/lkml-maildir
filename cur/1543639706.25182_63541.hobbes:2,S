The seek succeeds; 
On a disc-like device, attempts to write at that offset return -1 EFBIG;
the first attempt to read at that offset returns 0; subequent ones
return -1 and ENXIO.
After the seek, lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CURRENT) returns the (after end of
file) current offset.
At least for the ones I've been able to test on (UNIXWare, Solaris).
