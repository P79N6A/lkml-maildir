That's not the problem I'm trying to solve. I'm interested in the
transmission path. I have a shared bus, much like CAN, with automatic
contention detection -- if I transmit a 0 while someone else transmits a
1, the adapter automatically aborts its transmission and asserts CTS for
a while. I need to respond to CTS by immediately stopping my own
transmission -- otherwise when the adapter goes back into the normal
state it'll start transmitting again half way through my original
packet.
