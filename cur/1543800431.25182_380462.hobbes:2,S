I've been using the other patch for some time now and while it's a
life-saver, it does have one annoying little issue: If you press a key
with the Fn key down and release that key with the Fn key up, your key
is stuck. That is, the patch changes the keycode for Up & Down events
separately based on the Fn state at the time of the event.
What should be done is that when you release a key, you send the key up
with the keycode that matches the Fn state at the time the key was
pressed. That can easily be done using a simple bitmap that keeps track
of the Fn state on keydown for the various keycodes.
