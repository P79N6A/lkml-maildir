Ahem: ext3 -> LVM snapshot -> LVM -> DM mirror -> DM crypt -> md -> libata,
or worse.
No, it's not fixed.  The model is wrong.  Virtual block drivers should not
be callling submit_bio.  The recursive IO submissions should be handled
on a dedicated stack, most probably allocated as part of the request queue.
This could be done easily in device mapper and md, or better, in
submit_bio.
