Well, -104 is Connection reset by peer. Nothing in nbd would cause that 
directly. Without seeing the error messages from the nbd-server it's 
hard to tell, but I suspect that either nbd-server is dying at startup 
(check the syslog on the server, a common cause is failure to open the 
file/partition) or you have some sort of networking issue. Can you 
otherwise communicate between the two systems over a TCP connection ?
