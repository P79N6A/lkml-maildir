Sort of.  Some accelerometers actually act more as input devices than as
monitoring devices.  E.g. HDAPS has no intelligence whatsoever about what is
happening (it doesn't to any sort of threshold detection, unlike Apple's
motion sensing stuff), but it can give you reasonable resolution at a
maximum sample rate of 500Hz (I don't recommend getting it to go that fast,
though) for two axis, with configurable running-averaging.  Looks a lot more
like a joystick to me than a hardware monitoring sensor.
It's just a matter of PoV, and one can easily make a case for accelerometers
to live in either hwmon or input.   As long as they're all in one place :-)
