How about busy_flags or busy_state, then? Active sounds like a bool to
me, and frankly what FreeBSD uses really has no bearing on what we
should choose :-)

Keep IDE_BUSY as saying 'we are busy handling an event', ie expecting an
interrupt at some point. This is what is serializing access to the
channel, not the spin lock btw. Only one 'user' can flag the channel as
busy and then proceed to setup a command etc.
I dunno about your #2, that sounds a bit confusing.
