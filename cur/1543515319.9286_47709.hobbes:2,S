Put a Makefile fragment with all the options used to build the
kernel (including CPU type, optimization, -g flag on/off etc) in
<kernelsource>/include/linux/buildoptions.mak
Then start all standalone module Makefiles with:
====================================
# Point this to the include files of the kernel you wish to build for.
KINCLUDE = /usr/src/linux-2.5.10ac20/include
include $(KINCLUDE)/linux/buildoptions.mak
CFLAGS := -I$(KINCLUDE) $(CFLAGS)
====================================
Document this in Documentation/standalone-modules.txt
That should fix it once and for all.
Peter Anvin said he once had such a buildsystem up and running, he
sent the patch to Linus but Linus rejected it. Perhaps it is time
to try again.
