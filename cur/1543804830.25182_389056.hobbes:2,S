You are right, but I thought that duplication was the appropiate to be the most conservative with the preexistent code and also providing for the needed duplication of the strucutre minix_dir_entry.
The secondary structure (minix3_dir_entry) has to follow all the endeavours of its parent one, so both are here.

Yes, but if I do, is closer to a rewrite of the preexistent code. And I think that it not deserves it. Minix is not so important (sorry if some one is listening).

You are right.

Just to follow the style found.
