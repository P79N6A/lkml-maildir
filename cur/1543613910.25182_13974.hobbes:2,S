ide-cs, I'd say.
The way hotplug generally avoids this problem is via schedule_task() - that
was why it was written in the first place, I think.
And given that we need to bump the event up to process context, we may
as well do it at the earliest stage.  Looks like the fix it to kill
off the timer altogether, replace it with a tqueue and ask keventd
to run ide_release.
