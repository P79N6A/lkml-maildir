After upgrading from 2.4.16 to 2.4.17pre2 I got the following message in 
dmesg:
.
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(80)
parport_pc: Via 686A parallel port: io=0x378
devfs: devfs_mk_dir(printers): could not append to dir: dffe45c0 "", err: -17
lp0: using parport0 (polling).
.
or 
devfs: devfs_register(nvidiactl): could not append to parent, err: -17
devfs: devfs_register(nvidia0): could not append to parent, err: -17
with 2.4.16 and before the message was:
devfs: devfs_register(): device already registered: "nvidia0"
Why has this changed, and what is actually happen? My system runs fine.
greetings
