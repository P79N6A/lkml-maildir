Well if there's a race then the file may end up not being truncated after
this patch is applied.  But that could have happened anwyay, so I don't see
a need for i_sem synchronisation either.

Odd code layout?

This partially obsoletes the similar optimisation in inode_setattr().  I
guess the optimisation there retains some usefulness for O_TRUNC opens of
zero-length files, but for symettry and micro-efficiency, perhaps we should
remvoe the inode_setattr() test and check for i_size==0 in may_open()?
