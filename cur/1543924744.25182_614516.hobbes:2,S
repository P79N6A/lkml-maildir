you killed perfmon.
perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c: In function 'pfm_init_sysfs':
perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:411: error: 'kernel_subsys' undeclared (first use in this function)
perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:411: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
perfmon/perfmon_sysfs.c:411: error: for each function it appears in.)
I'll drop the perfmon tree and shall soldier on.
