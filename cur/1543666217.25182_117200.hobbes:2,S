It was the PLD cdrtools-2.01a05-1.i386.rpm; it is the same source I
built from, though it was looking in /usr/include/linux for headers, and
I changed my build to go to /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include.

I worked it out.  The source out of the box looks in
/etc/default/cdrecord; most distros change that to /etc/cdrecord.conf.
