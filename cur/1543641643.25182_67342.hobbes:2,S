I doubt that. Even if I did, it's wrong.

Yes. Audio CDs and VCDs, to be exact. Probably anything other than
vanilla ISO9660.

Yes, I do that quite a lot since DAO is a requirement for overburning,
on my writers anyway. For both data and audio CDs. I just tried it
again. It makes no noticeable difference, -dao or not. Data write good,
audio write bad.
