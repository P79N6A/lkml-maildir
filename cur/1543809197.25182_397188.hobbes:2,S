In this case they _are_ equivalent due to symmetry.  If the other  
device _may_ assume that the connection is broken, then you _must_  
assume that the connection is broken.  Since either device _may_  
assume that, both devices therefore _must_ according to spec.

No, as I said before, a good set of USB suspend scripts can solve  
this problem.  All of the ones I am aware of *now* already sync all  
data, which is good enough to prevent data-loss in _every_ case where  
the device is spontaneously unplugged.  On the other hand, this is  
_never_ good enough if the device is accidentally switched underneath  
us while suspended (and that's not so terribly uncommon, I know a lot  
of people who would do that accidentally, myself included).

I think you just proved my point.  Running the "sync" command a  
couple times then unplugging the USB stick basically never results in  
data loss even if the filesystem is mounted.  Spontaneously switching  
block devices under a mounted filesystem is guaranteed to either  
panic the machine or cause massive data corruption or both.

SCSI != USB.  Users generally don't expect to hotplug SCSI devices  
while booted and running (with the exception of some _really_  
expensive hotplug-bays where we expect the admin to know what the  
hell they're doing).  On the other hand, users _do_ expect to hotplug  
random USB devices whenever they feel like it.
