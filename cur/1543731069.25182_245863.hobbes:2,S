What's the problem? Let's say a file has three streams/forks/whatever: the 
unnamed one, and two additional named. The filesystem can treat these three 
streams like three independent (but related) files on disk so, if the author 
attribute belongs to the first named stream, only the first named stream (and 
its corresponding file on the backend) would need to be modified. No need to 
move MBs of data around.
