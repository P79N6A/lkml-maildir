So if I would need to iterate over all descriptors including empty
I need to type all this long for(;;) form again? For me for_each_irq_desc
implies to iterate over each irq_desc allocated regardles of internal
descriptor data. For example in list_struct we have a special test if
entry is empty or not. So I think hiding details is not that good (and
that is why I was asking for more descriptive macro name). BUT if it
really supposed to behave like that then I don't object :)
