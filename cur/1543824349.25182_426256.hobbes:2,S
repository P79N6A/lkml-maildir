Yes and the most important thing is that someone made -o barrier the 
default and did not notice. Someone else? :-D

You may, or may not, take that serious. I only ran each test once (since 
3m31s vs 53s shows "enough" of the issue).

Well as mentioned, -o nobarrier solved it, and that's it. I do not actually 
need barriers (or an UPS, to poke on another thread), because power 
failures are rather rare in Germany.
