Have tried to progress this.
As far as I can tell an oops occurs on this line
	get_user(htransp, transp);
or on this line (if parameter kspc = 1)
	htransp = transp ? *transp : 0xffff;
in fb_set_cmap.
It appears that transp (aka cmap->transp) is a bogus address.
Can someone who is familiar with this code give me a little insight into 
what I should expect to see here. Could there be some sort of reuse of a 
stale struct fbcmap here?
