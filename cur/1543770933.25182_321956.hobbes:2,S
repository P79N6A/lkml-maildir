Unfortunately the LCD/Wifi buttons seem to be managed directly by the
hardware/BIOS. They do not generate input or ACPI events. I have no problem
with the power button or lid generating acpi events.
My best idea at one point was to figure out some way to reset the keyboard
driver, but I don't know how. In theory I could modularize the whole
serio/keyboard system etc, but then I would have no way to unload/reload the
necessary modules without some other form of input, like over a network
connection. I might try that anyways just as an exercise in futility.

I tried suspend2 on a lark, but could not get it to work.. always complained
about not being able to allocate enough pages for the image.. which was
clearly bull.. but who knows. Google didn't turn up much.
Thanks for your input, Jim.
