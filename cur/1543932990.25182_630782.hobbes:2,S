This actually adds a bug back into the code.
We're trying to work out how to cleanly break out of
the net_rx_action() ->poll() loop when a device is
brought down yet getting hammered with packets.
I'll try to devote some time to this over the weekend,
meanwhile just toss this patch, we know it's an issue
that all the drivers need to get audited for but we
can't fix that until the above paragraph stuff is worked
out.
Thanks.
