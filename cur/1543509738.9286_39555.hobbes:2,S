Really? 
In my kernel it is: 
void __free_page(struct page *page)
{
	if (!PageReserved(page) && atomic_dec_and_test(&page->count)) {
		if (PageSwapCache(page))
			panic ("Freeing swap cache page");
		page->flags &= ~(1 << PG_referenced);
		free_pages_ok(page - mem_map, 0);
		return;
	}
}
which is very understandable IMHO, and probably answers your later 
questions. Perhaps you were looking at the wrong __free_page ?
BTW, even the low level free_pages_ok code isn't that hard to understand if you
look up the buddy allocator algorithm in some text book like the Knuth.
