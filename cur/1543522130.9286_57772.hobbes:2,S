mediaone/roadrunner customers also can't mail a lot of other lists, and
can expect to gradually cease to be able to function on the internet at all.
You might also want to tell rr.com that you will be writing to your 
parliamentary representatives asking them to support access by all ISP's
over cablemodem  networks so you can get good cable access as cable modem
users. That'll scare em a lot more
