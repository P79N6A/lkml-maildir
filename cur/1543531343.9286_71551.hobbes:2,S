   The problem has been discussed in length over the last week or two in
the threads "Overcommittable memory" and "Some questions about the linux
kernel". The problem is that linux doesn't check for availability of
RAM+swap before letting applications allocate memory. This is known as
overcommitting memory. There is an option to control this,
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory, but it has very little effect at all. I've
started looking at how much (or little) work it will be to fix it.
