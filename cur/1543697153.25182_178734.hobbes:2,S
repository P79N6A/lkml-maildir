   Can you explain me this games with signs there?
   Or this code expected to work reliably for timeouts < (ULONG_MAX/2)?
   time_before/time_after - do implicit conversion to signed types, 
while jiffies/friends are all unsigned. If one day gcc will be fixed - 
and it will truncate data here as I expect it to do - this will not work 
at all. Or this is a feature of 2-complement archs?
   (ldd2 again is silent on this topic - and I'm totally confused...)

   It is state machine, it is event driven - there is nothing that can 
yield CPU to someone else, because in first place it does not take CPU ;-)))
   Right now it is run from tasklet - so ksoftirqd context.
   Ok.
   Thinking about this gave me hints to understand userspace 
implementation of timers, which was used with my network layers before I 
have started kernel port.
   Idea is simple: all times absolute (think struct timeval). all given 
timer events are put into let us say binary heap, with timeval used as 
key. Check for expiration == O(1) - and this check is called in 
"while(1) { schedule(); }" loop. If we have NO expired timer - we are 
fast to yield CPU to someone else. Slow case of dequeueing from heap 
(what is O(log(n))) is really slow by definition - we are dequeueing 
event from heap and it needs to be processed.
   Looks Ok to me.
   Clearer/cleaner/safer than games with sign & ./kernel/timer.c 
implementation (internal_add_timer/cascade_timers/run_timer_list - what 
all those mess is about?).
