Yeah. Use Alan's kernels with VMware. These are one which I daily tests
and for which I can say that they works (== do not use VMware with
2.4.13-ac8, vmmon will not restore correct %cr2 value under some
conditions, use -ac7 until it is clear whether non-standard %cr2 usage 
is going to stay or not).

Is it really solid freeze (what does alt-sysrq-s,u,s,b)?
