That can't be true. It isn't actually following the Lindent rules. It has 
that braindamaged "put the type on a separate line" thing for function 
declarations, making a "grep" not show the type. That's very much against 
the Linux coding style.
So either your "indent" is broken, or you've used something else than 
Lindent.
Also, if it's a pure indentation change with no other changes, I'd almost 
prefer it as a script, not a patch.  That way it's obvious to everybody 
that it's just doing indentation.
