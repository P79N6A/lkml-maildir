I'm going to drop the cpumask_t refinements in this Patch to the files:
  arch/i386/kernel/smp.c
  arch/x86_64/kernel/smp.c
A gentleman named "Hari" (Hariprasad Nellitheertha <hari@in.ibm.com>) on
the thread "BUG_ON(!cpus_equal(cpumask, tmp));" is working more
essential changes to these same lines.  No sense my colliding with him;
and if his changes go in, mine are no longer relevant.
So I will clear the path for his work.
