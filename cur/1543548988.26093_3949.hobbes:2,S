This was under MS/DOS 10 years ago probably.
Nowadays you can connect 30 disks of about 4 ms average seek time to a
single Ultra 160 2 channels 64 bit 66MHz PCI controller. With appropriate
benchmarks that gain advantage of disk prefetching, you can easily observe
30,000 short IOs per seconds and even more (15000 per channel). This
happens using no more than 3 disks per BUS.
For real work, with disks actually seeking, such an possible system should  
probably be capable of performing more than 6000 IOs per seconds (That's 
theory from me, since I never saw such a system :-) ).
This gives some margin for wasting CPU cycles but far less than you seem 
to assume, in my opinion.

Not wasting uselessly CPU cycles is still worth it, in my opinion.
