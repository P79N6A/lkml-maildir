           Summary: USB mouse freezes under X
    Kernel Version: 2.5.6[89], 2.5.6[89]-mm
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: greg@kroah.com

Distribution: Red Hat 9
Hardware Environment: Intel 82801DB hub, MS Intellimouse Explorer
Software Environment: Vanilla RH9
Problem Description:
When using the mouse under X, it sometimes freezes up, responding to no further
input.  This does not affect keyboard interactions (but I have a PS/2 kbd, not a
USB one).  The problem can be "cured" by switching virtual terminals, or by
killing and restarting X.
Steps to reproduce:
Start X, open a few windows, waggle the mouse with vigour, preferably while
dragging a window around over other windows (though this is not necessary). 
Within a few seconds, the mouse should freeze.
The problem can take hours to manifest itself if the mouse isn't being used
much, but it always happens.
