Hi all!
When I am switching between the console and X, suddenly my mouse has a
strange behaviour. Every text is marked by just moving the mouse over, and
can't select anything by clicking. When I click anywhere just the marked
text is unmarked.
That mouse behaviour happens not every time, when I switch between and it
happens very often. It's annoying me!
I can fix that problem, when I reconnect the serial connector of the
mouse. But I hate it to fix that problem again and again in that way...
gpm 1.18.1 is running on the console.
The problem occured on the kernels 2.2.12, 2.2.13 and 2.2.17-pre1. I
didn't tested other kernel versions.
The mouse itself is a serial 2-button MS-Mouse connected to /dev/ttyS0.
Please CC me, if I am not on the list.
Regards,
Christoph Egger
