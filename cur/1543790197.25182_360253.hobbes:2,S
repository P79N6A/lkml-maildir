Indeed. This is a nasty issue can affect a number of different systems.
The best solution in my mind is to utilize alternative clocksources when
necessary (one of the main reasons for creating the flexible clocksource
interface: so we can easily use something else). 
In my patches, I have a function mark_tsc_unstable(), when called will
drop the tsc's rating value and will cause another clocksource to be
chosen (as long as one is available). Right now we call it when we know
the TSC is going to have problems. But maybe we should be more dynamic
in our detection.
Do you have any details about the hardware? Are the TSCs not being
synced well enough, or are they falling out of sync? i386 is a bit more
aggressive about using the TSC in SMP systems, where x86-64 has more
conditionals. Maybe some of the x86-64 logic should be moved to i386 as
well.
