Speaking of userfs, did it die?  I remeber it being thought about being
included
in the main kernel tree (at least hooks for it) at some point a few
years back
(probably pre 1.0/1.0/1.1 days).
I'm working on some user land C++ libraries do FS type things and zip
is one of the to be supported types (I've got some code already, but it
it still in progress).
(which I'm assuming userfs kind of dropped out because the latest I
found was
an ALPHA from July 1997)
Was userfs dropped out becuase people thought it was a bad idea, or did
interest just
die out?
Regards,
Steve
