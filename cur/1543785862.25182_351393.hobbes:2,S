Please, stop spamming list with your (almost all stupid) questions.
At the first read some material. ldd3 is the book, which will help you 
(the 3rd time I tell you that). There is explained how to write pci devices.
Then read some code, as Rolf Eike Beer wrote. Almost everything what 
will you ever need was written at least once.
Then think, if you didn't see the thing you want somewhere and take a 
look there.
And after all tries ask list, why the driver is not working.
At least Rolf and me wrote you, that you need to call pci_enable_device 
and you do NOT do that again. So?
thanks,
