The obvious thing to do would be to make it a mount option, so that
(a) recompilation is not necessary in order to use the feature, and
(b) the feature can be turned on or off on a per-filesystem feature.
In 2.6, it's possible to specify certain mount option to be specifed
by default on a per-filesystem basis (via a new field in the
superblock).  
So if you do things that way, then secure deletion would take place
either if the secure deletion flag is set (so it can be enabled on a
per-file basis), or if the filesystem is mounted with the
secure-deletion mount option.
