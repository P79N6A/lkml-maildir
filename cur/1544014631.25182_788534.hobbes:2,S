Attempting to use mkfs immediately after creating
partitions using sfdisk, (in the same shell-script)
fails with all kernels I have tried. The partition
information doesn't get updated for several seconds!
In every case, with both ext2 and ext3 file-systems,
I can create them manually or I can sleep in the
shell-script. However, I don't think this problem
should exist.
The problem was first discovered with old-fashioned
IDE disks. I don't have any spare SATA drives to
see if the problem exists there. I note that sfdisk
says it is re-reading to update the parition information.
Does anybody know about this or care?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
