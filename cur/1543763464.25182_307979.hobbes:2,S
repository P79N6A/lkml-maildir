I deliberately renamed it to '_base' because then it is much more grepable.
But I don't mind doing s/_base/base/ if you prefer.

I hope it is unlikely that __mod_timer() would hit the already running timer,
so hopefully this will not degrade the performance. And I don't see a simple
alternative to ensure the timer's serialization. At least it spins without
interrupts disabling.
