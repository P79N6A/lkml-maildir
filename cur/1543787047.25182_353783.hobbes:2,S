With the lock breakdown, Iozone read performance went up by 5.5% on a 2 way
x86 xeon box, with two hwifs and two processes reading from disks connected
to each hwif.  There seems to be a small  regression on Iozone write
tests -- about 1.5%.  Maybe this is measurement noise as there is no apparent
reason for this.  We plan to run more tests to see if the regression for
writes is statistically significant.
Btw, there was some problem with the moving of tuning code in this patchset
causing disks not to work in DMA mode. We were fixing that; will publish a
newer patchset with test results soon.
Thanks,
Kiran
