Hi,
this release made my sensors broken. With mm3 it worked nicely.
This is what sensors-detect gives me:
Driver `adm1021' (should be inserted):
   Detects correctly:
   * Bus `SMBus nForce2 adapter at 5100' (Algorithm unavailable)
     Busdriver `i2c-nforce2', I2C address 0x4e
     Chip `National Semiconductor LM84' (confidence: 5)
Driver `eeprom' (should be inserted):
   Detects correctly:
   * Bus `SMBus nForce2 adapter at 5100' (Algorithm unavailable)
     Busdriver `i2c-nforce2', I2C address 0x50
     Chip `SPD EEPROM' (confidence: 8)
   * Bus `SMBus nForce2 adapter at 5100' (Algorithm unavailable)
     Busdriver `i2c-nforce2', I2C address 0x52
     Chip `SPD EEPROM' (confidence: 8)
Driver `w83781d' (may not be inserted):
   Misdetects:
   * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
     Chip `Winbond W83627HF' (confidence: 8)
Driver `w83627hf' (should be inserted):
   Detects correctly:
   * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
     Chip `Winbond W83627HF Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)
Of course most of the drivers are not in the kernel, but w83781d worked 
for me with mm3 and now it does not. gkrellm2 still is able to read out 
voltages and fan speeds but no temperatures anymore.
Typing "sensors" just gives me:
w83627hf-isa-0290
Adapter: ISA adapter
