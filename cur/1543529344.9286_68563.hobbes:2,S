Yes if you are using GLibC 2.1.2 (suppose you doing). Not you but GLibC's
maintainers. There are UGLY, UGLY hack to check is devpts is not mounted and
fall back to use "old, good way". Unfortunatelly in case of devfs this hack
fails horribly and "old, good way" is not available. It's fixed in glibc 2.1.3
by making ugly hack even more ugly but devfs compatible...
