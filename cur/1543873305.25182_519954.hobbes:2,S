Radix trees' space behavior is extremely poor in sparsely-populated
index spaces. There is no way they would save space or even come close
to the current space footprint.
Lock contention here would be a severe functional regression (note
"functional," not "performance;" the lock contention surrounding these
affairs takes down systems vs. mere slowdown nonsense), so it would
necessarily depend on lockless radix tree code for correctness.
The comment block describing the hashtable locking is stale and should
have been updated in tandem with the RCU changes.
