OK.  It has a size restriction: PERCPU_POOL_SIZE is the maximum total
kmalloc_percpu + static DECLARE_PER_CPU you'll get, ever.  This is the
main downside.  It's allocated at boot.
The __alloc_percpu allocator is extremely space efficient, by not
insisting on cache-line aligning everything: __alloc_percpu(SIZE)
overhead is sizeof(int), plus SIZE bytes (rounded up to alignment
requirements) removed from per-cpu pool.
The allocator is fairly slow: they're not expected to be thrown around
like candy.

It uses the same method as the static ones, so it's a single addition
of __per_cpu_offset (assuming arch doesn't override implementation).
This is a requirement for modules to use them (which was my aim: the
other side effects are cream).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
