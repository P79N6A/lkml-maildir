It turns out that our particular problem was hardware related. In
particular, the motherboard (ABIT BX6 V2.0) could not cope with three
128 Meg DIMMS inserted. Any two of the three worked just fine, but
three in total failed. We ran the tests under 2.0.37. 
We are going to stick with 256 Megs and go back to 2.2.5 (complete
reinstall) and see what happens.
