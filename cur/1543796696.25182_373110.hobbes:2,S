Agreed. And X depends on workload.
Several approaches make sense.
(Y is size of image. Obviously Y < half of ram and Y > some minimum
ammount of kernel data. My approach is Y as low as possible, your
approach is Y as high as possible.).
1) Try to make Y as much as possible, but 500MB max. Common user
workloads fit into 500MB, so user should get responsive system after
resume, but we'll not write excessive ammounts of data.
2) Only free memory that was not used in last 10 minutes. That should
keep system responsive enough after resume.

I'd prefer not to have extra tunables. "Write only 500MB" will work
okay for common desktop users -- as long as common desktop fits into
500MB, that is. "Free not used in last 10 minutes" should work okay
for everyone, but may be slightly harder to implement.
