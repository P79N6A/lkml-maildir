Hello Jeff,
	Hearing that bash strips the eighth bit surprised me, because I think I
remember using it with kterm (kanji-term) and two-byte characters.  I
could be wrong though.
	Anyway, I think the trick is modifying the inputrc file. Oh yes, here
we go.  This is from Debian's /etc/inputrc:
/etc/inputrc:
# /etc/inputrc - global inputrc for libreadline
# See readline(3readline) and `info readline' for more information.
# Be 8 bit clean.
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
	I think I also heard that libreadline is up to version 4, but I only
have version 2.  I think the next bash will have version 4.
all the best,
-BenRI
