I think pxa-camera (as well as sh-mobile-ceu and other soc-camera host 
drivers in the works) is not a very good example here. Sensors connected 
to embedded controllers like PXA indeed use a dedicated camera bus but 
only for data exchange. This bus comprises of data and synchronisation 
lines only. Sensors are still connected over an i2c bus for control and 
configuration, also been open to other busses, I haven't seen such 
examples as yet. I might have misunderstood what has been discussed here 
though.
