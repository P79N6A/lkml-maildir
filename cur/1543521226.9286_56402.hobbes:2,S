1. you can do a hisaxctrl <id> 1 0x33ff and look at the messages on
/dev/isdnctrl
2. You can open 2 minicom one on /dev/ttyI0 the other on /dev/ttyI1
set a MSN with AT&E<MSN> and dial the MSN on the first with
atd<MSN>. You should see a RING on the second minicom and you can type in
ATA there.

No, because a telefon don't accept data ISDN calls.

Normally you use ipppd or make a raw IP connection (depends what your
provider offer to you).

You can try kisdn (no experience).
