Hi Patrick, 
Thanks for your email. I did what you suggested
a) removing usb modules / patching usb.c 
With the same .config this is the output of lsmod
Now modules are
-------------------------
Module                  Size  Used by

If I patch usb.c there's no need to remove usb modules, 
and I get the same result:
echo -n mem > /sys/power/state

The only problem now is that if I suspend, when resuming, neither the
mouse nor the NIC works, but it's getting much better.
with 
echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
Stopping tasks: ===================================================================

 Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, artsd not stopped

IIRC, I only have to kill artsd before hibernating...
Anyway, thanks again,

Ramon
