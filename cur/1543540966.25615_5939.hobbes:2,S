 I think you are misunderstanding.
 If it chdir()'s then access _should_ fail[1].
 If it is chroot()'d then it wouldn't be able to open() via. that
scheme anyway.
 ...but apart from all these it's slower it's not arguments, as a sys
admin I _know_ that for permissions on a name[2] I have to check the file
itself and the previous directory[3], if anything changed that simple
permission model to a complicated one where I have to check _every_
dir back to the root then it's time to get out vi and diff IMO[4].
[1] Logically, I haven't checked this but I doubt there is any magic
there if dirname() == $cwd.
[2] A name == a vfs object, be it a file, a socket, a dir, etc.
[3] Not counting hard links
[4] From what Ted's said this isn't going to happen, so i'm happy, I'm
just giving you another reason why Ted is right :).
