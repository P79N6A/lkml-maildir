Unfortunately, this trace is somewhat useless.  Without symbol
references, it is impossible to say where the panic occurred
or where (symbol location is highly dependent on how and what you
compiled (into) your kenrel.  If the panic is completely reproduceable,
the easiest way to get a useful dump is to apply the SGI kdb patches
and get a real trace.
