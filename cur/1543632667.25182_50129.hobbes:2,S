Hello,
Thanks a lot for your help to all of you...
The last thing, I want to make sure of, is that the following type of code:
int atomic_xadd(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
	int ret;
	__asm__(LOCK "xaddl %1,%0"
		: "=m" (v->counter), "=r" (ret)
		: "0" (v->counter), "1" (i));
	return ret;
}
is less efficient than this one:
int atomic_xadd(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
	asm volatile(LOCK "xaddl %1,%0"
		: "+m" (v->counter), "+r" (i));
	return i;
}
The reason for it is that the first one is more easy to read (at least for
me as a beginner). 
Thanks again for your precious comments.
Best,
Giga
