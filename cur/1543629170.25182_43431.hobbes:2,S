To what are you objecting? You aren't disagreeing with Keith here. He 
merely said that there's no chance of him working on modversions until
the newer build system that's sane w.r.t. dependencies is incorporated.

Distributions are unlikely to be shipping 2.5 kernels. As long as 
modversions can be reimplemented properly by the time 2.6 is released, 
what's the harm in disabling it for a while?
It's hard enough to keep kbuild-2.5 up to date with recent kernels as it 
is; let's not keep moving the goalposts by adding new requirements for the 
initial adoption -- once it's in and the makefiles are maintaining 
themselves, we can concentrate on reimplementing the niche features.
