I assume you're talking about 'struct bus_type'. They're there to 
represent types of buses. There is one or each type of bus. There should 
be one for SCSI, but it doesn't care about what the device type is. 
'struct device_class', which is coming soon, is used to represent types of 
devices, like disks, cdroms, etc. Device classes don't care what bus a 
device resides on. It's the logical interface to the device.
