Hello!
I tried the prepatch 2.4.27-rc3 from www.kernel.org. After installing the
Kernel I was unable to write to my DVD-RAM Drive, LG GSA-4040B.
On 2.4.26 i was able to mount /dev/hda (the DVD-RAM Drive) with read/write
support enabled. mke2fs /dev/hda works without any problems.
With 2.4.27-rc3 I can mount the Disc read-only.
I can't create any filesystem nor write to a Disc which I prepared  on
2.4.26.
cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info on 2.4.26 shows
CD-ROM information, Id: cdrom.c 3.12 2000/10/18
drive name:             hda

The only diffrence is the addidional line on 2.4.27-rc3:
Can write RAM:          1
I used the same config-file for 2.4.26 and 2.4.27-rc3
dmesg|grep hda on 2.4.26:
drive name:             hda

hda: attached ide-cdrom driver.

dmesg|grep hda on 2.4.27-rc3:
