There are some things that one can see but not read, and still be
recognizable even if your console is scrolling by.
An oops tracing, for one, is very unique and it's easy to pick them off
from regular text, especially on a relatively slow console such as vesafb.
We may even choose to colorize the output so they can stand out further.

I agree, I don't think it's needed.
