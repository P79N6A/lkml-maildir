You better don't ask DB people and in esp. the Oracle people
about opinnions on interface design. Unless you wan't something
fscking ugly internally looking like FORTRAN/COBOL coding.
They will always scrap portability/usability use undocumented behaviour 
and so on in the case they can presumably increase theyr pet benchmark
values.
One of the reasons Solaris is *feeling* so slow is that they asked
Oracle people too frequent about oppinions apparently. In esp. they did 
forgett that there are other uses then DB servers ;-).
PS. I just got too much in touch with Oracle to not hate it...
