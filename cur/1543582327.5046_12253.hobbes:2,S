Hi Alexey,
Actually sendfile() _does_ timeout using SO_SNDTIMEO. It just takes longer
to timeout because the kernel sendfile() page loop will (usually) need to
timeout a short write, and then timeout a 0 byte write.
So the actual timeout would be 2 * SO_SNDTIMEO.
Unfortunately, I'm seeing timeout at (I think) 3 * SO_SNDTIMEO, which I
can't account for.
Cheers
Chris
