The problem isn't that it oscillates, at least the oscillations shouldn't
cause any problems - though we probably shouldn't see large scale
oscillations like this anyway.
The problem is that at the low point in the cycle, the machine is
unusable.  It is utterly unresponsive until the writes complete, which can
take a very long time (in the case of the ppc machine, several minutes!)
Anything that does disk I/O will block for a long time - having 'ls' take
two minutes is not a good thing.
2.2 does not exhibit this behaviour.
On the plus side, it appears that several other people are reporting this
problem in 2.4, so I don't think I'm totally out to lunch.
