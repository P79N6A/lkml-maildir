It's hard for me to do it right now, because I don't have them in 
isolation (they do NFS and other stuff), and I don't have iptables support 
compiled into the kernel running the tulip. However:
starfire -> 3c59x
3c59x -> starfire
tulip -> 3c59x
tulip -> starfire
never lose data on a quiescent network:
ttcp-t: 83886080 bytes in 7.04 real seconds = 11640.36 KB/sec +++
ttcp-r: 83886080 bytes in 7.04 real seconds = 11641.10 KB/sec +++
whereas
3c59x -> tulip
starfire -> tulip
*always* lose several packets:
ttcp-t: 16777216 bytes in 1.40 real seconds = 11717.40 KB/sec +++
ttcp-r: 16769024 bytes in 1.40 real seconds = 11679.39 KB/sec +++
and
ttcp-t: 33554432 bytes in 2.80 real seconds = 11714.81 KB/sec +++
ttcp-r: 33456128 bytes in 2.80 real seconds = 11660.28 KB/sec +++
and
ttcp-t: 83886080 bytes in 7.00 real seconds = 11704.40 KB/sec +++
ttcp-r: 83722240 bytes in 7.00 real seconds = 11674.67 KB/sec +++
So I would tend to blame it on the tulip -- but the Rx side of it, not the 
Tx, which this discussion was about...
