It pretty much has to be an IRQ sharing issue,
most likely in the USB driver side of the house.
I don't know enough about the USB drivers really,
but the interrupt routine inside the ueagle-atm.c file
doesn't seem too "sharing friendly".  But perhaps that
part is handled by the layers above (?).
That's where I'd start looking if I were you.
