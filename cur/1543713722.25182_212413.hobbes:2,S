Pretty early. Boot time, loading scsi drivers. While initializing the
third scsi adapter on the system a device shows up dynamically on the
first adapter, the LLD schedules work to call scsi_add_device and we
end up with the hang.

I agree. There is another similar hang I ran into recently with the scsi 
core in that I was calling scsi_add_device from keventd, which ended up 
sleeping on the scan_mutex since the module load process was calling 
scsi_scan_host. scsi_scan_host was in the same kobject hotplug code, 
calling call_usermodehelper. I figured my LLD shouldn't be doing that, 
so I synchronized the events. Perhaps that was the wrong fix... I 
suppose I could have changed the LLD to always call 
scsi_scan_host/scsi_add_device/etc. from keventd...
