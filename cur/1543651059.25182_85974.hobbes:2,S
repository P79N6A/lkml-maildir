Yes and no ;-)
Ignoring for a moment initramfses loaded from your bootloader (a la 
initrd)...   The amount of code that runs in kernel space shrinks, which 
is the main point of early userspace.  If you are talking in terms of 
overall kernel image size, yes, but the initramfs cpio archive is 
ditching along with the rest of __init code, so you're really only 
talking about wasting a couple of additional pages in vmlinux -- a 
slight increase in disk space usage, and that's it.
So runtime memory usage certainly does not increase...
