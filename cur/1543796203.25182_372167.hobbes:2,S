It was something fairly large. Basically having a power of 2 batch size
meant that 2 concurrent allocators (presumably setting up the working
area) would alternately pull in power of 2 chunks of memory, which
caused each CPU to only get pages of ~half of its cache's possible
colours.
The fix is not by any means a single value for all workloads, it simply
avoids powers of 2 batch size. Note this will have very little effect
on single threaded allocators and will do nothing for cache colouring
there, however it is important for concurrent allocators.
