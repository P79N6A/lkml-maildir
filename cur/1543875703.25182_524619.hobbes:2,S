Subject: [PATCH] UML - fix I/O hang when multiple devices are in use
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[ This patch needs to get into 2.6.21, as it fixes a serious bug
introduced soon after 2.6.20 ]
Commit 62f96cb01e8de7a5daee472e540f726db2801499 introduced per-devices
queues and locks, which was fine as far as it went, but left in place
a global which controlled access to submitting requests to the host.
This should have been made per-device as well, since it causes I/O
hangs when multiple block devices are in use.
This patch fixes that by replacing the global with an activity flag in
the device structure in order to tell whether the queue is currently
being run.
