The automatic rule creator, uses MAC addresses by default, yes. There
have been extensions for S/390 support recently, to create other sorts
of matching rules.
The rules that rename the interface, are not limited in any way, and can
match on any property of the device, they are just not created
automatically today, but can be specified manually.
Maybe the network susbsytem should let us know in the event environment,
that a random MAC was created, so we can automatically create rules that
uses the path to the hardware as a match instead.
