Sigh, this is offtopic for a while, and I am not helping ;-)
A well-designed app should not be selecting 100% of its fds, but only
those fd's that need selecting...
If you are talking about a single application with 16,000 clients,
personally, I would use thread pools:  a few threads for doing poll(2),
a few threads for doing work, etc.  Anything above that is unlikely to
scale with demand.
