Subject: Preempt of BKL and with tickless systems

I think I have a reasonable grip on the voluntary and full preempt 
models, can anyone give me any wisdom on the preempt of the BKL? I know 
what it does, the question is where it might make a difference under 
normal loads. Define normal as servers and desktops.
I've been running some sched tests, and it seems to make little 
difference how that's set. Before I run a bunch of extra tests, I 
thought I'd ask.
New topic: I have found preempt, both voluntary and forced, seems to 
help more with response as the HZ gets smaller. How does that play with 
tickless operation, or are you-all waiting for me to run my numbers with 
all values of HZ and not, and tell the world what I found? ;-)
