Hi,
The first two of the following patches are resends of the patches I posted
yesterday, with some minor changes.
The most important is the 1/3 patch, because the userland suspend is partially
broken without it.  The changes in this patch have been acked by Pavel.
The 2/3 patch is a safety measure and everything should work without it, but
may break eg. if the user switches back to X while freezing processes.
It's generally a rework of the changes that have been acked already.
The 3/3 patch adds an ioctl() that will allow us to implement the
suspend-to-disk-and-ram functionality in the userland suspend tools.
Please apply.
Greetings,
Rafael
