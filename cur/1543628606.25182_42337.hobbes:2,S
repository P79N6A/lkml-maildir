Hi,
NTFS 2.0.2 for kernel 2.5.9 is now available. This is a small update mainly 
to incorporate kernel 2.5.9. Also the default fmask is changed to 0177 
which means files do not get the executable bit by default. The majority of 
users prefer it this way. Minor misc bug fixes. Updating is recommended and 
is necessary if you want to use kernel 2.5.9. Note the patch will work with 
2.5.7, too but it may not apply cleanly so you may have to do some minimal 
& obvious patch work yourself.
You can download patches for kernel 2.5.9 from Sourceforge:
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
And of course you can use BitKeeper to get our BitKeeper repository at:
         
http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-tng-2.5
And a on-line view of the repository is available here:

Best regards,
         Anton
