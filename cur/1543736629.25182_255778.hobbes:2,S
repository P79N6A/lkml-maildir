That's what we do at present.  do_page_cache_readahead() and
force_page_cache_readahead() are low-level functions which do not affect
file->ra_state.
Except whoops.  POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED is using force_page_cache_readahead(),
which bypasses the congested check.  Wonder how that happened.

  [PATCH] rework readahead for congested queues
  Since Jens changed the block layer to fail readahead if the queue has no
  requests free, a few changes suggest themselves.
  - It's a bit silly to go and alocate a bunch of pages, build BIOs for them,
    submit the IO only to have it fail, forcing us to free the pages again.
    So the patch changes do_page_cache_readahead() to peek at the queue's
    read_congested state.  If the queue is read-congested we abandon the entire
    readahead up-front without doing all that work.
  - If the queue is not read-congested, we go ahead and do the readahead,
    after having set PF_READAHEAD.
    The backing_dev_info's read-congested threshold cuts in when 7/8ths of
    the queue's requests are in flight, so it is probable that the readahead
    abandonment code in __make_request will now almost never trigger.
  - The above changes make do_page_cache_readahead() "unreliable", in that it
    may do nothing at all.
    However there are some system calls:
  	- fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED)
  	- madvise(MADV_WILLNEED)
  	- sys_readahead()
    In which the user has an expectation that the kernel will actually
    perform the IO.
    So the patch creates a new "force_page_cache_readahead()" which will
    perform the IO regardless of the queue's congestion state.
    Arguably, this is the wrong thing to do: even though the application
    requested readahead it could be that the kernel _should_ abandon the user's
    request because the disk is so busy.
    I don't know.  But for now, let's keep the above syscalls behaviour
    unchanged.  It is trivial to switch back to do_page_cache_readahead()
    later.
So there we have it.  The reason why normal readahead skips congested
queues is because the block layer will drop the I/O on the floor *anyway*
because it also skips congested queues for readahead I/O requests.
And fadvise() was switched to force_page_cache_readahead() because that was
the old behaviour.
But PF_READAHEAD isn't there any more, and BIO_RW_AHEAD and BIO_RW_BLOCK
are not used anywhere, so we broke that.  Jens, do you remember what
happened there?
