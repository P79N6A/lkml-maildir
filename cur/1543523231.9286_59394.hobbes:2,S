So if I use the Asus or FIC board with a stock kernel (2.2.14 etc.) I
should be able to see all my disks, no matter whether they are 33 or 66?
Also is there any appreciable performance or quality difference amongst
these boards?  I know Asus boards in general have a good reputation and my
Socket 7 Asus boards have been excellent, but the FIC boards appear to be
a good deal cheaper... OTOH I've never heard of them.  :P
Thanks.  :)
