Not particularly; clearly the EHCI driver enabled IRQs, since that's
not done until after the "USB 2.0 started, EHCI 1.00, driver 10 Dec 2004"
message prints.  And it shouldn't be an SMI issue, as might be improved
by that patch I sent this AM.
According to arch/i386/kernel/apic.c that "0x40" APIC error bit means
it got an illegal vector ... sounds to me like IRQ setup issues, since
USB code doesn't know about such things (they're not even exposed from
the arch irq handling code).
Try sticking a message where ehci_irq() returns IRQ_NONE and see what
IRQ status is being reported to EHCI.
