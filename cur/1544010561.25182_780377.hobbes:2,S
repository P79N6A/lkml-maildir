Subject: [PATCH 20/36] powerpc/44x: declare tlb_44x_index for use in C code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Hollis Blanchard <hollisb@us.ibm.com>
KVM currently ignores the host's round robin TLB eviction selection, instead
maintaining its own TLB state and its own round robin index. However, by
participating in the normal 44x TLB selection, we can drop the alternate TLB
processing in KVM. This results in a significant performance improvement,
since that processing currently must be done on *every* guest exit.
Accordingly, KVM needs to be able to access and increment tlb_44x_index.
(KVM on 440 cannot be a module, so there is no need to export this symbol.)
