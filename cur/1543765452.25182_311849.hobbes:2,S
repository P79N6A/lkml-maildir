This is exactly the case and this is better than what we have today
because it makes it easy to chose =y or =n, so rather than making
things work for subset 1 and screwing subset 2. Each distro can chose
which subset to screw by default and make it easy for them to unscrew
themselves.
Just to be clear, we can have two users A and B with the exact same
hardware.  A setting of  =y will screw user A and a setting of =n will
screw user B.  Ideally, they would both get better hardware, but that
is not always an option.
