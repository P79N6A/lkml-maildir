The interrupt handler's execution time will definitely defer the
execution of the process, but I think it does not steal the process's
time slice (the time_slice field not subtracted).

My understanding is, the ISR is in different context from the process
because of the definition of term *context*. In my opinion, to say two
code pieces running in the same context means that two pieces of code
has some logical relationship to meet a common objective. That's why I
said *context* is a higher-level logical concept. It's not a concept
defined in the level of hardware or code implementation, but instead
in the level of logical. I think, by its definition, it makes no sense
to say an ISR share context with the process interrupted by it because
an ISR just randomly interrupts a process, with no logical
relationship.
