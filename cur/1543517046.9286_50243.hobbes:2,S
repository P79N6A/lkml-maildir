	Aren't MDs around 10 years old now?  Not terribly modern anymore...
	If you're talking about a Toslink type of optical connector then I
really doubt it.  I don't think you can send anything other than the audio
over the connection.  So how would you seek?

	If you just want to pull the decompressed audio off of a minidisk
over a digital connection then all you need is a supported audio card 
with a digital input...hook the player to it and hit play...  I don't
think there is any way to get the compressed audio off of a minidisk.
	Does sony still make MD data drives?  I know at one point they
were unable (by design) to read music MDs...but with the popularity of
CD-R drives for burning CDDA I wouldn't be too surprised to see sony
come out with newer MD data drives that could burn audio MDs...
