I hadn't even built 2.6.9-rc2 due to the widespread and constant hang 
reports.

I'm not sure if I have a 2.6.8.1 in my grub.conf still.  This brings 
up a minor question:  How many entries can one actually have in the 
grub.conf before something overflows?  I'd set a rather abitrary 
limit of 16 here, but I have more room in the /boot partition than 
that, and the 2.6.8.1 kernel still exists I believe.

X-tacy version of an ATI Radeon 9200SE, 128 megs of ram.  And these 
lines from messages at about the time I did the startx I've not seen 
before:
Sep 23 03:19:55 coyote kernel: agpgart: Found an AGP 3.0 compliant 
device at 0000:00:00.0.
Sep 23 03:19:55 coyote kernel: agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 
0000:00:00.0 into 4x mode
Sep 23 03:19:55 coyote kernel: agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 
0000:02:00.0 into 4x mode
Sep 23 03:19:55 coyote kernel: [drm] Loading R200 Microcode
So this is something new with rc2-mm2 (new to me anyway).  The card, 
and its mobo socket are supposedly 8X, so why the setting to 4X?  Not 
that this has very much to do with this problem since 10fps can be 
done on AGP 0.05X :)
