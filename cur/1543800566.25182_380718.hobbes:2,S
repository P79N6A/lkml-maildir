Rubbish it will.
static void fn1(void *f)
{
}
void fn2(void *f)
{
        fn1(f);
}
on ARM produces:
        .text
        .align  2
        .type   fn1, %function
fn1:
        @ args = 0, pretend = 0, frame = 0
        @ frame_needed = 0, uses_anonymous_args = 0
        @ link register save eliminated.
        @ lr needed for prologue
        mov     pc, lr
        .size   fn1, .-fn1
        .align  2
        .global fn2
        .type   fn2, %function
fn2:
        @ args = 0, pretend = 0, frame = 0
        @ frame_needed = 0, uses_anonymous_args = 0
        @ link register save eliminated.
        @ lr needed for prologue
        b       fn1
        .size   fn2, .-fn2
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 3.3 20030728 (Red Hat Linux 3.3-16)"
You can't get a simpler function than fn1 to automatically inline.
GCC will only automatically inline using -O3.  We don't use -O3 with
the kernel - only -O2 and -Os.
