Currect me if Im wrong but...
After a fork() arent all the parent's fds shared with the children ? This 
means that both processes can access the same fds right ? So the epoll fd 
(beeing just another fd as any other) is too shared between parent and 
child ? Which would mean both parent and child will "control" the same 
epoll kernel struct when doing epoll_ctl on it ?
