OK, patch attached.  It's a bit awkward that some interfaces take a page
index while others take an offset in bytes.  I tested it with the code I
sent earlier in this thread.  I'll get results from oast and some dbcreate
runs comparing kernels with and without this change and post them when
available (probably in the next day or two).  Feel free to hold off
comitting this until that data is presented.

I don't think it's worth losing sleep over.  I wonder how many applications
actually mix buffered and unbuffered I/O to the same file.
Cheers,
Jeff
