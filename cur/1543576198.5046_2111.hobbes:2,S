can you do ls /mnt/www/www.kernel.org/ as well? I'm interested, I came
to conclusion that web filesystem is not possible... (If you can't do
listings, it is not really filesystem; you could do
 cat /mnt/www/www.kernel.org_index.html as well, and that's easy to
do.)

codafs can do pretty much the same.
