Hi,
I do have a device that's a multifunction device. Eventhough a MFD, it
just has one Interrupt which is shared by by a Configuration space for
each function. ie, INTA is shared between them functions.
In such a case, i am wondering, (since pci_probe returns a pointer to
one PCI function alone and i need to use both the functions in one
module alone rather than using a module for each function and that the
functions are quite similar for them to be used in different modules,
such that a separate probe/ISR etc is used) whether using pci_get_device
would be a better alternative to do manual searching for the functions
in such a case.
Thanks,
Manu
