We should aim to get the big copy-ext3-to-ext4 patch into Linus's tree as
early as possible.
I'm just not sure when to do that.  Immediately after 2.6.19-rc1 is
released would be good because it is when every tree (including -mm) is in
its most-synced-up state.
otoh, we should work out what our processes will be for keeping ext3 and
ext4 in sync wrt bugfixes, cleanups, speedups, etc.  If those processes are
good, we can do the copy-n-paste any time.  And they need to be good...
