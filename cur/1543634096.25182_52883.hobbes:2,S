Yes -- aio does the atomic_dec_and_test in the interrupt handler, and 
if that was the last user of the struct file *, it queues the io handle 
for cleanup from task context.

+/* __fput is called from task task when aio completion releases the last
+ * use of a struct file *.  Do not use otherwise.
