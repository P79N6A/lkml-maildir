Indent is fine as a first pass, it doesn't handle everything properly.
If it did, I think I would have figured it out by now.  And no, I'm
not going to go fix indent, I looked at the problems and the fixes 
and decided to pass.  Some of them just aren't worth fixing in 
indent.
Besides, I really don't believe in giving people crutches, I believe
in teaching them what it is I want and why.  That tends to stick.
