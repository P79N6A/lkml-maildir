Can you try to narrow it down a bit further...
As this happens when building fs/built-in.o it should be
straightforward to do so.
First step would be to do:
rm fs/built-in.o
make fs/ V=1
Then copy the ld invocation and try to remove the input .o files one-by-one.
This should tell you which .o file is causing the bug.
Next step is to try to squeze down the offending file until the
errornous part remains.
Last time I did a
make fs/file.i
And then I used gcc & ld to compile and link.
Gradually removing stuff from file.i made me spot the problem
with the weak prototype in a header file.
I guess something else is making ld hit this error now.
PS. Just reinstalled my dev box so no crosscompiler atm.
