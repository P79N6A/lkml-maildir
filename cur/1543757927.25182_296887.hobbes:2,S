You don't run databases over a network filesystem unless you're begging
for trouble. For the other common purposes you'll usurally get a more
stable behaviour, since the failure on the client won't prevent the server
from properly writing the metadata or flushing the cache.

a) There are systems without local storage.
b) It won't help while stat()ing a non-cached object.
c) This would involve race conditions for e.g. two disconnected nodes on
   reconnect. AFAI can see, this race can be solved by:
 c1) The final transaction must be delayed until it's ACKed or 
     NACKed. This may delay the D-State for some seconds, but not enough.
 c2) The server will have to keep track of the clients and need to be told
     when a user left for a trip to the south pole without unmounting. 
     Very undesirable.
 c3) Ignoring. Very, very undesireable.
 c4) Requiring explicit transaction handling by the applications.  
     Interesting, but not in the near future.
d) This won't allow synchronous updates without falling back to classic 
   handling.
e) The users will update some files, get a positive reply and shut down
   their PCs before the changes can be commited to the server. If the
   server will not come back or the client is not rebooted within
   reasonable time, this will cause silent data loss.
f) This will require reliable identification of the network server.
g) I'm not only thinking of NFS/..., allthough I used it as _the_ example. 
   E.g. if you see your IDE drive failing, you'll want to declare it dead
   instead of waiting $num_of_sectors times five minutes until the kernel
   decides to give up.
I agree that most D-states are problems that need to be fixed instead of
being worked-around, but sometimes you can't fix the problem without
access to the crystal-ball-device. Therefore all devices that can block
will need a manual override (with different probability), and the
processes that were stuck will need a way to recover or be stuck forever.
Obvoiusly the system is healthy enough to do some important and
uninterruptible work after those errors occured, so having them stuck will
be OK for now. Instead, the next task might be freeing the file
descriptors preventing you from unmounting your removable media or network
share or allowing really-forced umount.
