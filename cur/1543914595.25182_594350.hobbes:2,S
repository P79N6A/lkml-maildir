Thanks for pointing our noses to this. Your comment triggered some further 
internal discussions about the meaning of the values for the current 
system implementation. We'll think this one over again and repost the 
final solution in time for 2.6.24-rc1.
If the rest of this patchset is okay with you, could you apply it and 
leave out this one patch? The patchset will apply cleanly without it.
Thanks,
  Joachim
