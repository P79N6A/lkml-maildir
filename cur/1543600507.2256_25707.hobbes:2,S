Whether or not there was a protection fault is indicated with
SEGV_MAPERR vs. SEGV_ACCERR.  Unfortunately, the siginfo_t doesn't have
any place to indicate whether it's a read or a write fault.  *How could
they have left that out?*
The Right Way, IMHO, would be to find some acceptable,
standard-compatible way to get the read/write flag into the siginfo_t.
