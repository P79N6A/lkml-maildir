Ingo, Attached is the latest patch I sent Linus.  I never doubted the
usefulness, just the practicality of having endusers parse so much
information.
At any rate, the approach in Linus's BK is wrong because (a) the debug
is hit way too often to just BUG() and (b) we have to take into account
PREEMPT_ACTIVE.

Agree 100% here.
