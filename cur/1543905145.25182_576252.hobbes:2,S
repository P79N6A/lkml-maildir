This is right.

We can't use the spin_lock_irqsave/restore() variants since PPS
sources cannot manage IRQ enable/disable. For instance, the serial
source doesn't manage IRQs directly but just uses it to record PPS
events. The serial driver manages the IRQ enable/disable, not the PPS
source which only uses the IRQ handler to records events.
About using both mutex and spinlock I did it since (I think) I should
protect syscalls from each others and from pps_register/unregister(),
and pps_event() against pps_register/unregister().

This is due the fact I cannot manage IRQ enable/disable.

Thanks a lot for your help!
