sorry if this has been discussed before.
Yesterday I noticed a ethernet device swapping between kernel 2.2.15p2
and 2.3.40p6.
Below the dmesg:
--->2215p2
eth0: MACE at 00:05:02:44:21:ad, chip revision 9.64
eth1: DE450-CA at 0x0400 (PCI bus 0, device 15), h/w address 00:00:f8:30:76:00,
      and requires IRQ25 (provided by PCI BIOS).
de4x5.c:V0.544 1999/5/8 davies@maniac.ultranet.com
--->2240p6
eth0: DE450-CA at 0x0400 (PCI bus 0, device 15), h/w address 00:00:f8:30:76:00,
      and requires IRQ25 (provided by PCI BIOS).
de4x5.c:V0.545 1999/11/28 davies@maniac.ultranet.com
eth1: MACE at 00:05:02:44:21:ad, chip revision 9.64
Now my question, is this similar to the SCSI controllers, the first
recognized becomes scsi0?
Is this introduced with the 'new' PCI probing?
The situation occurs on PowerMac 7200. MACE is the onboard eth.
It's a bit odd, when switching between 2.2.x and 2.3.x I have to connect
both cards to the hub to get ethernet working.
Thanks for any hint
Andreas
