"pusha" does not promise 64 bit writes.  It can't be interrupted, but
I see nothing that ensures the multiple 32 bit words are combined into
atomic 64 bit writes as seen by other CPUs or peripherals.

Yes, if you want a 64 bit write and don't want to use cmpxchg8b, MMX
will do it.
You can also do it with the floating-point "fistpll" instruction (also
called "fistpq").
