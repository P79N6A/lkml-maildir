You are not really one of the few. A lot of my own work is done on a single 
core pentium M 1.7Ghz laptop. I am not endowed with truckloads of hardware 
like all the paid developers are. I recall extreme frustration myself when a 
developer a few years ago (around 2002) said he couldn't reproduce poor 
behaviour on his 4GB ram 4 x Xeon machine. Even today if I add up every 
machine I have in my house and work at my disposal it doesn't amount to that 
many cpus and that much ram.
