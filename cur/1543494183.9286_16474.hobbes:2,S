The limit is in the VFS layer on 32-bit CPUs, so switching filesystems won't
help.  Ext2 and the VFS do support large files on 64 bit CPUs, so you're in
luck.

You can't mmap block devices.  I don't think avoiding the filesystem will help
particularly, though you could avoid some filesystem overhead in the real-time
path by preallocating the file.
