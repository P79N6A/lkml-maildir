Nope. Doesn't have to be a symlink - it can be a directory. Overmounted by
bind-mount - you can mount over a mountpoint.

Indeed it doesn't. Replace symlinks with directories and make
e.g. revalidation to trigger mount --bind.

Oh, that I agree with - we probably shouldn't allow such mounts in the
first place (non-directories and directories shouldn't turn into each
other).

Umm... Works as symlink minus several bogus details associated with the
latter?

Not much - I'ld check do_follow_mount() and neighbors, though (watch for
assumptions re directory vs. non-directory in the lookup_dentry() and
other places using ->d_covers/->d_mounts).
Again, the right thing for 2.4 is to do bind-mount instead of playing with
symlinks. As for the autofs plans - ask HPA...
