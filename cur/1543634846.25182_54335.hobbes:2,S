I am sure that you can have things look correct as well as run
properly. However, you didn't show us the code. You need to
do something like:
            interruptible_sleep_on(&semaphore);
while your wake-up occurs with:
            wake_up_interruptible(&semaphore);
Or, you can do (the hard way) :
             while(!something)
             {
                 current->policy |= SCHED_YIELD;
                 schedule();
             }
Both ways (and others) will look fine with `top` and will sleep
properly.
Cheers,
