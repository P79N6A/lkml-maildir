I think I got Rusty's latest patches that I found in my mailbox.
I haven't looked at desc.h, but at least processor.h ordering was totally
b0rken (e.g. #define __cpuid native_cpuid was after several uses). I fixed
that to make at least the CONFIG_PARAVIRT not set case compile.
I can't see how this ever worked either.
Haven't attempted the CONFIG_PARAVIRT case which apparently needs more work
(it is currently marked CONFIG_BROKEN) 
Can someone double check this is the correct patchkit?
