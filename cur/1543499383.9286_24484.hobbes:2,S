By whom/how are permissions handled? Even if it's symlinks, the original
files in /devfs have to carry them (you can't follow symplinks to files you
can't access directly!). And that means the kernel has to know how to set
up permissions for a new device when it appears, and remember the settings
from one boot to the next. Gross. And a kludged initscript that sets them
up on each boot is even worse. As bad as the much-maligned MAKEDEV, but run
_each_ boot, so much more critical.
