You have to enable PCIGART in drivers/char/drm/radeon_cp.c:
There should be a block that looks like this, near the top of the file:
#if defined(__alpha__)
# define PCIGART_ENABLED
#else
# undef PCIGART_ENABLED
#endif
Either replace it with, or add below it, "#define PCIGART_ENABLED" without the ""s.  This has worked fine for me, though I do 
not know if it is the technically "right" solution.  There is a leftover quirk that I have not looked into investigating that 
the module "agpgart" will still be loaded and ISTR that the radeon driver still registers itself as an AGP device.  However, 
this is not really a big deal.
Unfortunately, I think you also need to recompile X and I do not remember where in the source tree PCIGART_ENABLED needs to be 
defined - probably in the ati/ driver directory somewhere.  Hope that is enough of a pointer to get you looking in the right place.
