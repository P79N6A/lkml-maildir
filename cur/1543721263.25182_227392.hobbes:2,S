I'm not quite sure what's causing this, but I get the following error
message (make V=1):
        ld  -static -N  -T arch/alpha/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s 
arch/alpha/kernel/head.o   init/built-in.o --start-group  usr/built-in.o

net/built-in.o --end-group  -o .tmp_vmlinux1
local symbol 0: discarded in section `.exit.text' from drivers/built-in.o
make then aborts at this step.  At other times, I've gotten errors that
read the same as the above line, for symbols "1" through "4", in order.
I'm going to guess there's a problem with one of the drivers I've got 
built-in to the kernel, but I haven't been able to figure much else out..
I tried using readelf, but didn't find the "0" symbol.
.config and drivers/built-in.o are at 
http://x-ray.rcs.purdue.edu/alpha-2.6/
gcc version is "gcc (GCC) 3.3.3 (Debian 20040422)"
binutils version is "2.14.90.0.7 20031029 Debian GNU/Linux"
