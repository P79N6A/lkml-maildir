pull req below.  If it turns out to be more trouble than its worth,
let me know, and I'll fix up the patches by hand, and generate
a new git tree. (If it comes to that, I understand Thomas has a script
that may help).

    [CPUFREQ] Don't take semaphore in cpufreq_quick_get()
    
    I don't see any reason to take an expensive lock in cpufreq_quick_get()
    Reading policy->cur is a single atomic operation and after
    the lock is dropped again the state could change any time anyways.
    
    So don't take the lock in the first place.
    
    This also makes this function interrupt safe which is useful
    for some code of mine.

    [CPUFREQ] cpufreq_stats: misc cpuinit section annotations
    
    * Stop referencing the callback directly from the __init and __exit
      functions of this driver, and instead explicitly call
      cpufreq_update_policy() et al. This enables the callback function
      to be marked as __cpuinit (and the notifier_block __cpuinitdata),
      thereby saving space when HOTPLUG_CPU=n. This also enables us to
      use other tricks to replace __cpuinit{data} in future.
    
    * cpufreq_stats_free_table() is only called from __cpuinit or __exit
      marked functions, making it an ideal candidate for __cpuexit.
    
    * Fix missing space in the module description

    [CPUFREQ] implement !CONFIG_CPU_FREQ stub for  cpufreq_unregister_notifier()
    
    Callsites such as arch/powerpc/oprofile/op_model_cell.c are having to
    open-code #ifdef CONFIG_CPU_FREQ only to be able to get at the full definition
    of cpufreq_unregister_notifier(), because no empty stub is available for the
    !CONFIG_CPU_FREQ case.  Let's provide one, to be able to remove such #ifdef's
    from the rest of the kernel tree -- those will come in a subsequent patch.

commit 1c2562459faedc35927546cfa5273ec6c2884cce
Author: Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de>
Date:   Tue Oct 2 13:28:12 2007 -0700
    [CPUFREQ] allow ondemand and conservative cpufreq governors to be used as default
    
    Depending on the transition latency of the HW for cpufreq switches, the
    ondemand or conservative governor cannot be used with certain cpufreq
    drivers.  Still the ondemand should be the default governor on a wide range
    of systems.  This patch allows this and lets the governor fallback to the
    performance governor at cpufreq driver load time, if the driver does not
    support fast enough frequency switching.
    
    Main benefit is that on e.g.  installation or other systems without
    userspace support a working dynamic cpufreq support can be achieved on most
    systems by simply loading the cpufreq driver.  This is especially essential
    for recent x86(_64) laptop hardware which may rely on working dynamic
    cpufreq OS support.
