I should clarify, since Natalie pointed out that some systems
run in MPS mode...
If the system is booted with "acpi=off", then mp_irqs[] includes
everything advertised by the MPS tables, and so setup_IO_APIC_irqs()
does hand out vectors to un-occupied IOAPIC RTEs.  However, if the
MPS tables are accurate enough to skip RTEs that are not used
on that machine, then it hands out vectors for RTEs which
_could_ have devices on them.
On the ES7000 there are potentially lots of IOAPICS with pins
that can't possibly be used.
If only low-numbered RTEs were used on these IOAPICs,
then it would be simple to put in a hook to pretend the
upper entries do not exist, and compress the GSI name space.
But apparently they use some high numbered RTEs, so
we go ahead and allocate the full size of the IOAPIC
in what becomes a very sparse and > NR_IRQS GSI name space.
Of course if one is going to compress this name space,
it would be possible to put a platform dependent hook in
where a GSI is translated into an apic:pin pair...
This would be much cleaner than the current compression...

I should qualify this...
If the system is booted with "acpi=off" and MPS is used,
then mp_irqs[] includes everything that is in MPS, and thus
setup_IO_APIC_irqs()
