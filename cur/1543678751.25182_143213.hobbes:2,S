Actually there's a posix option group for finding out exactly that,
(see 
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/posix-option-groups.html#CHOWN_RESTRICTED
)
but yeah it might be more of a legacy thing.
Adding a common sysctl for this would allow glibc to properly implement
patchconf(..., _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED), but it seems SuSv2/3 sais it must
be always defined:
