Nope.

Yup.

If all you mean is that you don't want to have to tell it what to send,
yes, it does that automatically.  If you start with 100 changes, 
I clone your tree, you add 200 more, all I do to get them is say
	bk pull
it will send them all, quickly (works very nicely over a modem or 
a long latency link like a satellite).
