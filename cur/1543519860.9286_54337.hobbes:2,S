I will appreciate very much if someone can advice me.
I attempted to upgrade from 2.3.13 to 2.3.33 (I also
upgraded net-tool to 1.50 version). As a result networking 
seems to disappear. 
This is RedHat 5.2 setup initially.
My understanding is that there were major changes to
networking. Is there any guide/howto describing the
necessary steps in order to get it work?
Sincerely
Ildar
