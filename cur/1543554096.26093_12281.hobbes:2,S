If I may, please do not add it into stat/stat64 structure. On Netware, 
computing really used space can take eons because of it has to read 
allocation tables to memory to find size. It is usually about 500% 
slower than retrieving all other file informations.
Or at least add some parameter to stat so that filesystem can say which
informations are important for you. But I think that ioctl is less
ugly. But that's just my opinion and I know that others here are strongly
against ioctl.
