Well, I basically never do make clean or make mrproper (unless I'm playing 
with the build system itself, there it's of course necessary for testing). 
However, I do have a lot of clones of the bk trees around, used to work on 
different patches. And of course only few files differ between these 
trees, so using ccache is a big win when doing compiles in the various 
trees.

Well, the current kbuild doesn't do separate source/object, so that's not 
an issue. If people compile out of tree things using Rules.make, you're 
right, I need to make sure to stick to the absolute path there.
