Addendum to my previous reply:
Regarding stock 2.2.10: it behaves like the pre4 w.r.t. the
three tests:
ac11:		infinite negative dentries provided the stat() is
		repeated within every second. This is the case even
		when the parent dir mtime is < 15 minutes old. Once
		the stat() calls stop, there remains a >1 second
		live time for negative dentries. pre4/stock seems ok.
ac11/pre4/stock	negative dentries for about 30 seconds provided the
		mtime of the parent dir is >15minutes old. No repeated
		stat() in this case.
ac11/pre4/stock	negative dentries for about 1 second otherwise.
A parameter which can also have effect is whether or not
the test is done in the mount point. I avoided the mount point
in all tests. I hope this clarifies a bit.
