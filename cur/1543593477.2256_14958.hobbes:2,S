Substitute "mm" for "process".  Yes, of course, that would be vastly
better than the present way (or is there some gotcha? it's hard to
understand why someone would choose to write it the way it is).
However... don't forget that another of the current swap problems is
pages being left in the swap cache after they've been unmapped from
(all) their mms - those need to be dealt with too.
