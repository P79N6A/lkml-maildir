Hi:
I have two machines with the Packet Engines Gigabit Ethernet NIC GNIC-II
(hamachi) running RH7.1.  One is an alpha, the other is a dual-cpu
coppermine P-III on a SuperMicro P3DME motherboard.  I was getting 325
Mb/s between them with the stock RH kernel, and I decided to upgrade to
the 2.4.9 tree.  It won't compile on the alpha, (keyboard stuff, fixed
in -ac1), so I got the ac9 patches, and built the kernel.  It's fine,
except that the hamachi won't work.  ifconfig shows no packets received,
but some errors, there are no strange messages in /var/log/messages.  I
then built the same kernel on the intel box, and the same thing
happened.  No working hamachi.
