   When sshing to my mailserver in a console and loading up mutt, I
   see that sometimes when there is a big screen update or when a lot
   of text is sent at once, the console somehow gets stuck as if I
   pressed ^S or scroll-lock, but the scroll-lock LED does not light.
   If I press scroll-lock twice, the session resumes.  Pressing it
   once makes the LED come on, but nothing changes.
Are you on an SMP system and are you using any of the framebuffer
drivers for the console or just the normal VGA console driver?
Later,
