The fact that both are cumulable is very handy. Basically, you put all
the common tools and filesystem bits in the initramfs, and only add modules
or add-ons in each initrd depending on your target system. Even if you work
on embedded system, as soon as there are chances that you have to deal with
several hardware models, you may be interested in supporting them with just
a small initrd difference.
