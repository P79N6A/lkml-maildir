Subject: Resend - Routing Oops in Kernel 2.2.1

Hi,
first things first: I'm not subscribed to the list so please cc me on replies.
Seems, the last send didn't make it to the list, so here's it again:
Here's what I (accidentally) found out for Linux Kernel 2.2.1:
1. Create a slip interface on pty/tty and configure it with SIOCSIFFLAGS
   and friends ioctl() calls (results in new interface sl0)
2. Create a route with RTF_UP|RTF_GATEWAY and member rt_dev=NULL
3. Happily use the interface
4. send SIGINT to the process managing the interface: this causes
   the actions as described in the next step(s)
5. Delete route from 2. but accidentally with rt_dev=<uninitialized>
6. shut down sl0 interface using SIOCSIFFLAGS and friends
7. restore pty/tty line discipline
Now somewhere in between 5. to 7. the kernels goes crash boom bang.
My best bet is 5. as rt_dev there points just somewhere and as after
fixing my source the crash didn't happen again.
Could somebody please look into this (it seems that kernel routing
needs a fix)?
Cheers
Andreas Steinmetz
