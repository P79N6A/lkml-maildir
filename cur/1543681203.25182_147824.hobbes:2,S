hey there Tom,
sorry for the delay.
i just patched the 2.6-test1 with this patch, and it sure does remove
the "scheduling when atomic" errors
I still have the problem that i mentioned in "mis-identified cisco
aironet pccard" where the cisco card is recognised as a memory card at
bootup. I don't know where to start with tracking this problem down - if
you have suggestions for me to look at, i'll have a go :)
cheers
sven
