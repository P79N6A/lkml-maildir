Andrew,
Yep.  This will do it.  3Ware (Adam) and the other RAID card folks 
would need to call and setup their queues based on how many disks 
are actually attached to the controller (which they know based on
their local state).  It would be great if this value were maintained as
adapter specific, i.e.
id blk_init_queue(request_queue_t * q, request_fn_proc * rfn, int depth)
{
        INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->queue_head);
        elevator_init(&q->elevator, ELEVATOR_LINUS);
        blk_init_free_list(q);
        q->request_fn           = rfn;
        q->back_merge_fn        = ll_back_merge_fn;
        q->front_merge_fn       = ll_front_merge_fn;
        q->merge_requests_fn    = ll_merge_requests_fn;
        q->make_request_fn      = __make_request;
        q->plug_tq.sync         = 0;
        q->plug_tq.routine      = &generic_unplug_device;
        q->plug_tq.data         = q;
        q->plugged              = 0;
        // NEW CODE
        if (depth > 1024)
           depth = 1024;
        q->queue_nr_requests_local = (depth ? depth : -1);
        //  
        /*
         * These booleans describe the queue properties.  We set the
         * default (and most common) values here.  Other drivers can
         * use the appropriate functions to alter the queue properties.
         * as appropriate.
         */
        q->plug_device_fn       = generic_plug_device;
        q->head_active          = 1;
}
and the modify this function something like this:
static void blk_init_free_list(request_queue_t *q)
{
        struct request *rq;
        int i;
        // NEW CODE
        //
        int queue_depth;
        queue_depth = ((q->queue_nr_requests_local != -1)
                      ? q->queue_nr_requests_local
                      : queue_nr_requests);
        //
        //
        INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->rq[READ].free);
        INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->rq[WRITE].free);
        q->rq[READ].count = 0;
        q->rq[WRITE].count = 0;
        /*
         * Divide requests in half between read and write
         */
//        for (i = 0; i < queue_nr_requests; i++) {
        for (i = 0; i < queue_depth; i++) {
                rq = kmem_cache_alloc(request_cachep, SLAB_KERNEL);
                if (rq == NULL) {
                        /* We'll get a `leaked requests' message from blk_cleanup_queue */
                        printk(KERN_EMERG "blk_init_free_list: error allocating
requests\n");
                        break;
                }
                memset(rq, 0, sizeof(struct request));
                rq->rq_status = RQ_INACTIVE;
                list_add(&rq->queue, &q->rq[i&1].free);
                q->rq[i&1].count++;
        }
        init_waitqueue_head(&q->wait_for_request);
        spin_lock_init(&q->queue_lock);
}
and we're there.
