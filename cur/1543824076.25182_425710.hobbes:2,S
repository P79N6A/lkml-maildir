We collect statistics about the delays that are experienced by each task on
the system. Note, that this information is per-task.
The information collected provides us with information about the number of
times the the task executed on the runqueue, the delay it encountered
waiting for CPU (run_delay) and the total time it spent on the runqueue.
Similar statistics are collected for block io and swapin block io.
The statistics can be queried at any time (during the lifetime of the task)
and user space can be notified of the statistics when the task exits.
More detailed information can be found at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/2/30
and in the Documentation/accounting directory tree in -mm
I hope this is the summary you were looking for.
