Great, that's the last missing feature on my laptop !

Yes it's listed in m3_hv_quirk_list,
and yes, commenting out the entry fixes the problem.

Guess what, git-alsa.patch (and actually also only the patch
to maestro3.c) do work on top on 2.6.12. Hardware volume control
works. That's great !
Actually, I'm experiencing another problem with -mm1 which might
be related to PCI and IO ports. This might be the cause of outw
generating the divide error I was seeing -mm1 if IO ports are
not mapped at the right place ?
Thanks,
Brice
