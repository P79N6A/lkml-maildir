ObPedant:
 Can you make a note of this in the comment a few lines above also,
so others who stumble across this code know why the check is there.
afaik, this chipset info isn't public, so it may not be obvious
in the future why the check has been added.
Just something simple like..
-    /* ServerWorks LE chipsets have problems with  write-combining
+    /* ServerWorks LE chipsets < rev 6 have problems with write-combining
       Don't allow it and  leave room for other chipsets to be tagged */
Otherwise, if this works for everyone else with rev 6+ serverworks
chipsets, looks ok to me.
regards,
Dave.
