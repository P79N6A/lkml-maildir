Who is branch, who is mainline? The branch owner _will_ be pissed off if
his head version changes each time he syncronizes. What if mainline dies,
and the official line moves to one of the branches? What happens when there
aren't just two, but a dozen developers swizzling individual csets from
each other (not necesarily just resyncing with each other)? If said
developers also apply random patches from a common mailing list?
This is _much_ harder than it looks on the surface.
