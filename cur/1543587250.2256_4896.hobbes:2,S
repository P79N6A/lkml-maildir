These things usually sit off a serial port.
I.E. /dev/lcd is a link to /dev/ttyS0 or whatever.
Anyway the main point is you don't have access to libc.
So how can you access the serial port from the booting
kernel. Well to spit kernel messages out the serial
port you pass the console=ttyS1,19200 or equivalent
parameter to the kernel. So see what that is done 
in the kernel code and copy.
Note www.kernelnewbies.org is probably more appropriate 
for this sort of question.
