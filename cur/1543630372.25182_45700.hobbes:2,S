I agree that we should stick mainly to discussing InfiniBand 
at the LSM BOF and let the TOE discussion happen elsewhere,
although the issues of implementing InfiniBand SDP and 
TOE in the kernel are similar as they both want a way to
bypass the S/W TCP stack, but with SDP this could simply be
a new address family, where the TOE guys want a way to dynamically
replace the TCP stack with a TOE driver. 
However, perhaps we should start a new email 
thread to discuss topics of interest for the LSM BOF 
rather than highjack this thread to do so.
