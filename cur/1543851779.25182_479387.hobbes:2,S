The innards of the disk are already a file system in themselves. The
disk is a network storage appliance on a funny cable with an odd command
set, nothing else. The internal storage model of the drive and external
one can be quite different.

Also theoretically states like "random block you only read in the middle
of moving".

It happens because
-	There is limited if any protection on the PCI bus generally
-	Many PC systems don't have ECC memory, ECC cache
-	PATA does not CRC protect the command block so if you do enough PATA
I/O (eg you are a US national lab ..) you *will* eventually get a bit
flip that gives you the wrong sector with no error data. SATA fixes that
one.
-	Murphy is out to get you..
Network people use end to end checksums, when working with huge data
sets people generally use app<->app checksums. Serious network using
people with big data sets also often turn off the hardware checksum
support on network cards - its faster but riskier.

Not seen that, although they do move stuff aorund in their internal
block management of bad blocks. I've also seen hardware errors that lead
to data being messed up silently.
