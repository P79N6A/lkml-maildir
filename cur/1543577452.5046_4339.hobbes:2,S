	The right one to ask is  <postmaster@vger.kernel.org>,  and
	somebody has already made that question there.
	Powers that be (DaveM) need to decide on it.
	I am also one of those postmaster persons, but DaveM decides
	things at the Majordomo subsystem.  (And thus lists.)

	As you wish, I don't have ambitions either way.
	One thing though, NEVER configure list to modify through
	going message subjects any way what so ever.  Doing that
	is just a sign of giving up on people who don't know how
	else they can recognize traffic thru given lists.
	(I leave it as an excercise to the reader to review full
	 headers of this message in their mailbox, and see which
	 RFC 822 defined headers they could use to recognize which
	 list this message has gone thru.  Some of you will receive
	 this in several copies via different paths!)
	Such subject modifications lead to abominations like:
		[linux-usb-devel] Re: [linux-usb-devel] Re: [linux-usb-devel] ...
	People don't clean their outgoing Subject: headers anyway.
