No need, just create directory /var/log/ksymoops.  insmod and rmmod
will automatically save the list of modules and the symbol table on
every module load or unload, neatly timestamped.  When you get an oops,
find the entries just before the oops and point ksymoops at those.
ksymoops -m /lib/modules/2.4.0/System.map \
	 -k /var/log/ksymoops/20010116093850.ksyms \
	 -l /var/log/ksymoops/20010116093850.modules < oops.txt
man insmod, section KSYMOOPS ASSISTANCE.  Much easier than trying to
reproduce the environment by hand.
