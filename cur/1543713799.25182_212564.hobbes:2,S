looks like you need a little workaround in the interuput routing code...please
apply the attached patch, send dmesg output plus output of dmidecode
( 
http://www.nongnu.org/demidecode/
 ).
on the other side it could be that the o2micro bridge is wrongly programmed.
what looks a bit weired is that both functions of the o2micro show Pin A
routed to IRQ 11. this could be wrong. i'm reading the spec now.
do you happen to have the redmond OS on this machine? it would be nice to see
which interrupt windoze assignes to the o2micro bridge.
and one more question: any change in the interrupt assignment if you use full ACPI?
