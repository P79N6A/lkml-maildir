The machine is stable except for power failures.

That's exactly the same as mine, down to the date code (except the 8 on
the last line is actually a B).

My logs are long since rotated, but that looks familiar.

I tried a wide array of drivers - kernel, vendor supplied, and newer one
from Donald Becker.
The box has a Amptron 8600B motherboard, Cyrix 6x86MX, bogomips are 166 so
I think it was a 166 mhz machine.

Hmmm, it most definitely didn't function, as evidenced by the mark in the
wall the airborne card caused. :-)
