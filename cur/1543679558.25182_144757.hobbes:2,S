Looks fine to me.
Here is another one in gen_bitlen():
Replace:
  for (bits = 0; bits <= MAX_BITS; bits++) s->bl_count[bits] = 0;
with:
  memset(&s->bl_count[0], 0, MAX_BITS * sizeof(s->bl_count[0]));
Also the following could should be replaced(in defutil.h):
/* ===========================================================================
 * Reverse the first len bits of a code, using straightforward code (a faster
 * method would use a table)
 * IN assertion: 1 <= len <= 15
 */
static inline unsigned bi_reverse(unsigned code, /* the value to invert */
				  int len)       /* its bit length */
{
    register unsigned res = 0;
    do {
        res |= code & 1;
        code >>= 1, res <<= 1;
    } while (--len > 0);
    return res >> 1;
}
Anybody have a table version handy?
