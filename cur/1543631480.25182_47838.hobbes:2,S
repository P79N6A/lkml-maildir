Any indirect branch can be (and will be) predicted using the BTB. The
speculation starts before the BTB contents have actually been verified,
resulting in iTLB speculation.
Since the BTB can (and does) contain mostly user addresses (from previous
execution in user land), it's apparently quite common to speculatively
fetch user TLB entries even when you're in kernel mode.
(This is also, btw, probably anothre reason why you only see this bug in 
practice on a P4: much bigger BTB)

It doesn't pass the invalidate_tlb.
By the time the invalidate_tlb happens, the TLB fill has already finished, 
and has already picked up garbage.
READ my explanation. The garbage can (and does) contain the Global bit, so
even though we then flush the TLB, the garbage remains.

No. Understand the patch, _then_ complain.
