Note that 2.2.x does not HAVE a "min/max" function, so that cannot be an
issue.
Yes, some drivers and filesystems did their own private version, but if
they are maintained in both 2.2.x and 2.4.x, then it's obviously very easy
for them to change their private version to match the 2.4.x tree, so I
think this particular argument is rather bogus.
