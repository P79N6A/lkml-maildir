It is not my intention to deprecate bzImage at this time.  But instead
to provide an alternative.

This part is only for people using the kernel as a bootloader.  My
apologies if I didn't make it clear. 
Let me clarify a little with usage.  I have three cases I am targeting.
1) LinuxBIOS.  
    I need a kernel format that doesn't unconditionally do 16bit BIOS
    queries, as there is no 16bit code in LinuxBIOS.  bzImage doesn't
    work.
2) Portability.  
   For this I have with some simple bootstrap program that loads the
   kernel.  And then I have the kernel driving devices and acting a
   super bootloader.  Something like Grub but with the full power
   linux can bring to bear on the issue.  This is all I need to
   standardize the user booting experience on multiple platforms.
3) Network Booting.
   There is not much chance to change bootroms once they are flashed
   so they like LinuxBIOS need a general purpose interface, so that can
   handle whatever they need to boot.
On the dynamic stitching/initramfs side, the code should really be no
more complex than the current bzImage loading with ramdisks.  And if
bootloaders want to keep it simple can drop any optional ELF features,
which should be much simpler than todays bzImage.
Now I will shut up and let you digest this.
