Ok, but if you want to search for information in such big text files it 
slow, because you do linear search -- most datases use faster search 
algorithms like hashing and if you have multiple files (I don't if 
you're system uses multiple files (like bitkeeper) or not) which need a 
system call to be opened this will be very slow, because system calls 
itself are slow. And using rsync is also possible because most databases 
store their information as plain text with meta information.
