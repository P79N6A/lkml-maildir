Under memory pressure the page reclaim will first unmap the physical
page from the virtual address range, and then try to free it.
Obviously the freeing bit fails if you hold a reference to it, but the
unmap will work.
After that, userspace will have to (minor) fault the stuff back in.
Also, that same page-reclaim, or pdflush might decide to write out dirty
data, which will also result in (minor) faults when userspace will
re-dirty the pages.
Having a page reference will only avoid the physical page from getting
removed from its current mapping (and thereby also pins the mapping).
