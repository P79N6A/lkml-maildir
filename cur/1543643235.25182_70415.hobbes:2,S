Well the lazy invalidation would be OK - defer that to the next
userspace access, or just let the pages die a natural VM death,
maybe poke `ksmbinvalidated'.
But if you want to perform writeback within the local IO daemon
then hm.  That's a problem which NFS seems to not have?  I guess
you'd have to leave i_sem held and poke `ksmbwritebackd'.  Or teach
pdflush about queued work items (a tq_struct would do it).
But it's the same story: the requirements of
a) non blocking local IO daemon and
b) assured pagecache takedown
are conflicting.  You need at least one more thread, and locking
against userspace activity.
