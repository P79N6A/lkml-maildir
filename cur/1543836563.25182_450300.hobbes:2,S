Ok, that really is a pretty scary thing. The warning happens if the lock 
is released by somebody else than the person who took it. I don't _think_ 
that's supposed to happen, but with cpu hotplug locking being as 
"creative" as it is, maybe it's valid. 
I was planning on shutting the cpu hotplug warnings up for v2.6.18 - at 
least the "lukewarm IQ" one for _taking_ the lock recursively. But I had 
planned on leaving the unlock_cpu_hotplug() in place, since up until now 
it hadn't triggered, and it really smells like a bug if it does.
