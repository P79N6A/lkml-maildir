Run-time reporting of conflicts known at configuration time ? Wow, that's
a concept ! ;-)
You might as well just throw an #error into the code to fail the build.
So at least people will know before they reboot.
Better yet, an  error  or  warn  verb in the configuration language might
be quite useful. Or a way to declare forward references, but that approach
has other problems (e.g. how to sneak them into the Configure script).
