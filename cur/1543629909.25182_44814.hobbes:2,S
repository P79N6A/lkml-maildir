hmm.  It looks like your blockdev may have the wrong
blocksize in bd_inode->i_blkbits, and __get_hash_table
cannot find the 4k block against the 1k blocksize device.
It keeps returning zero.
The new pagecache-based __get_hash_table uses bd_inode->i_blkbits
to go from a block number to a pagecache index.  That works
fine when called via the official `bread()' function, but 
probably your __bread() approach has confused it.
Try running set_blocksize(bdev, PAGE_SIZE) before calling
__bread().
