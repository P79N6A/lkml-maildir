This arrived in the wrong order, and because it was dependent on another 
patch, and there was no explicit ordering, it didn't apply.
If you have interdependent patches, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make that very 
clear in the subject line. Make it say something like
	[PATCH 2/2] Make ksoftirqd a normal per-cpu variable
and then call the patch it depends on "[PATCH 1/2] xxxx"
(Even if they don't necessarily depend on each other, if you have tested
them in some order this is a good idea. They may have dependencies that
you didn't think of).
