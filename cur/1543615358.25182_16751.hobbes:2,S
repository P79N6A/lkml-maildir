The former is not necessarily sufficient in this case. You've still done the
broken pointer arithmetic, so even if the function isn't called strcpy() the
compiler is _still_ entitled to replace it with a call to memcpy() or even
machine_restart() before sleeping with your mother and starting WW III.
Granted, it probably _won't_ do any of those today, but you should know
better than to rely on that.
What part of 'undefined behaviour' is so difficult for people to understand?
