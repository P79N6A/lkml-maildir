Hello, Guys, hello, Jeff!
This issue seems to happen more than once:

What panic do you get?

I guess it panics, too, but the reboot still works, so you just don't
see the panic. (?)

Still the same thing over here. Unfortunately, I am pretty busy with other
work, and the affected system isn't really needed. It's an old
Tyan Tomcat IIID Mainboard with two Pentium I MMX 200MHz CPU's.
Theoretically I would be able to test the latest git snapshots, but currently
it's just not possible. :-(
Let me know if you cannot solve this issue - maybe I can spend some
time to give some more information for debugging by the end of this week.
Good Luck,
Best greets,
