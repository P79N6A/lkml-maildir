This is not really true. There are new columns or lines added to /proc
files, but old ones are not changes, and correctly writen /proc parsers 
should not break (unfortunately there are lots of incorrectly writen
proc parser around..)

First the kernel needs to export the necessary information. glibc is
hardly to blame here.

It has nothing to do with glibc. There are documented sysctls that use
HZ as unit, and Linux has long ago left the innocent state where you
can change documented interfaces without thinking and some migration
strategy.
