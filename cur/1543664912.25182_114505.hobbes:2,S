What I did to provoke the error was the following:
0) Successfully compile of the tree
1) Edit dummy.c to provoke an error during compile time
2) Run make
	It errored out when compiling dummy.c
3) Ignored the error, and su to root
4) make modules_install
So no make -k, I was just trying to install the modules that succeded so far.
