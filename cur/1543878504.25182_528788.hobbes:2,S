Hmm, it worked for me when I tested it this weekend. I did use 'dm-mod'
instead of 'dm_mod'.
This was using it on FC6, and LVM isn't loaded until after the initrd
finishes, as I don't use LVM at all. Everything was compiled as modules.
I cannot vouch for it working in the initrd, as I don't have a machine
that uses LVM for the root.
