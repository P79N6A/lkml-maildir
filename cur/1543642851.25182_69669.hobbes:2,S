Yes, it uses the wrong value.
It's not too big a difference to notice, the error in the frequency from
the ideal value in most cheap mainboard crystals is greater than 2 Hz.
So it's lost in the noise.
The clock is generated from a base crystal of 14.3181818 by division by 12.
The base crystal is the frequency found on ISA for the MDA/CGA adapters,
and is a NTSC dot-clock. All other frequencies on a motherboard (except
the RTC, which has a separate 32.000 kHz clock) are derived from it.
It's just if you try to get the computations correct, you may also want
to have this value correct. :)
