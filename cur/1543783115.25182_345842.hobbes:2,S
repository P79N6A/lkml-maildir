with your business.I need an experienced person like

assume responsibility of ownership as chairman but
will be bringing in profit /distribute profit monthly
or annually.
I am Henry Bori,a citizen of Nairobi ,Kenya.A former
Presidential adviser on Budget and planning to the
former president of Kenya,Daniel Arab Moi.I acuirred
this money as a result of gold and diamond export.
I am currently in possession of $58.1m,which i want to
use for investment purposes preferably in your
country.
Now the present government of Mwai Kibaki has
intensified efforts at probing Moi's government,
goverment officials have turned their backs on us and
have been frustrating me and others that served under
Daniel Arab Moi. For this reason, I left Kenya for
Western part of Africa, in the Calabar City.
That is why i need someone like you who is trustworhty
