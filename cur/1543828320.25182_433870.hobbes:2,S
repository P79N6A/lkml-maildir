This downside is a little problematic. Wouldn't it be possible to disable
the interrupt signal on the terminal, and let the user re-enable it when
needed using "stty intr ^C" ?
I too am used to starting with init=/bin/sh, but I'm also used to launch
ping in the background. However, if getting Ctrl-C working implies a risk
of killing init, then I'd rather keep it the old way.
