   Provided there isn't a very heavy contention among readers for the
   spin_lock.
Even if there are thousands of readers trying to get the lock
at the same time, unless your hold time is significant these
readers will merely thrash the cache getting the rwlock_t.
And then thrash it again to release the rwlock_t.
This is especially true if the spinlock lives in the same cache
lines as the data it protects.
All of this is magnified on NUMA.
