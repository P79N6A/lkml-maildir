That was my initial suspicion, since I have two of them and typical swsusp
(Laptop) users tend not to have more than one. But I gave up on that theory
when Bert's log showed only one disk:
#        syncing disks
#        suspending devices
#        suspending c0418bcc
#        suspending devices
#        suspending c0418bcc
#        suspending: hda ------------------[ cut here
If he had two disks, his trace should look more like mine:
# Syncing disks before copy
# Suspending devices
# Suspending device c0390e4c
# Suspending device c03911a4
# Suspending devices
# Suspending device c0390e4c
# suspending: had ------------[ cut here ]------------
# kernel BUG at drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:1557!
