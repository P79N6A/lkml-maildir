General readability comment.  This:
enum hrtimer_mode {
	HRTIMER_ABS,	/* Time value is absolute */
	HRTIMER_REL,	/* Time value is relative to now */
};
enum hrtimer_restart {
	HRTIMER_NORESTART,
	HRTIMER_RESTART,
};
#define HRTIMER_INACTIVE	0x00
#define HRTIMER_ACTIVE		0x01
#define HRTIMER_CALLBACK	0x02
#define HRTIMER_PENDING		0x04
is quite bad.  They enumerate different conceptual things but they are all
in the sane namespace.  The reader sees code which is using a mixture of
HRTIMER_ABS, HRTIMER_RESTART and HRTIMER_ACTIVE and gets needlessly
confused over what they all signify.  
This:
enum hrtimer_cb_mode {
	HRTIMER_CB_SOFTIRQ,
	HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE,
	HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_RESTART,
	HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_SOFTIRQ,
};
is better.
