Yep.  I'd still like to know exactly what the circumstances around
this are: just what are the constraints which apm requires us to
observe for successful suspend?  I've never had a laptop fail to
suspend due to this sort of problem with ext3, so it's obviously
different from one apm implementation to the next.
Cheers,
