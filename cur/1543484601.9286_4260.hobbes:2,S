This is correct, and you are fortunate that reset and disable of the
single device did not cause the entire hwif to reset and disable DMA on
the hard drive, too.  So I will suggest to you again that you split the
two devices, the current code does not properly handle DMA except for
hard drives.  Feel free to due as you wish, but do not give issue should
you have resulting problem after overlooking my advice.
