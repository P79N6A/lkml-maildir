kjournald is actually running a commit.  So recovery was successful
and the filesystem is up and running.
It's this trace which is the problem.  All the other processes
are blocked by kjournald.
kjournald is pretty much write-only.  It will perform the
occasional read to load the indirect blocks which describe the
journal location.  But that would show a different backtrace.
It appears that kjournald has submitted a block for writeout
(via submit_bh() or ll_rw_block()) and the interrupt which
signifies completion simply hasn't happened.

journal_commit_transaction() writes blocks from several different
places, via ll_rw_block() or submit_bh().  It waits for the
buffers to come unlocked in the end_buffer_io_sync() or
journal_end_buffer_io_sync() completion handlers.
Possibly the device driver has failed to deliver an interrupt.
