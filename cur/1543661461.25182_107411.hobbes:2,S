Well, if I set it to "Linux", the IDE controllers disappear completely
and the I2O fails to initialize. I might have a different firmware,
version, though. It works then with Promise's own sx6000 specific drivers
only.

Indeed.

Something very strange. It does XORs in HW, and has two IDE channels but
that's all. And it's completely undocumented. It could be reasonably
fast, though. The chip name is PDC20621.
