The line you provide doesn't look anything like the two forms in the
md.txt you mention. Or rather it looks like a blending, but neither of
them is md0= in form. I have to look at the code to see which is
correct, possibly yours, since the 
  append = "md=0,/dev/sda1,/dev/sdb1"
line doesn't seem to work :-(
The md.txt says the persistent superblock form is:
  md=<md device no.>,dev0,dev1,...,devn
which doesn't seem to work for me.
