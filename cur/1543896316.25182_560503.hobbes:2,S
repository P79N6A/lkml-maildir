PF_MEMALLOC cannot work from interrupt context, nor should it. But there
are other options.
What I'm saying is that if you do use the reserves, you should ensure
the use is bounded. I'm not seeing anything like that.
This is a generic API, who is to ensure some other non-swap device will
not deplete memory and deadlock the reclaim process?
Also, please do explain why mempools are not usable? those will have
exactly the same semantics as you are now getting (if PF_MEMALLOC would
work from interrupt context).
Also, explain to me how an IOMMU is different from bounce buffers? They
both do the same thing, no? They both need memory in order to complete
DMA.
Is it just a broken API you're working against? If so, isn't the Linux
way to fix these things, that is why we have the source code after all.
