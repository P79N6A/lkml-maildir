I couldn't work out why this patch shouldn't work so I tried to duplicate 
the problem I saw before and I can't.
I've tested the patch against autofs-4.1.3-123 (latest source rpm I could 
find) and autofs-4.1.4-8 with a couple of my patches (only on the 4.1.4 
version) that shouldn't affect it and I can't seem to break it.
I must have got my kernel modules mixed up. It probably means there's some 
backward compatibilty work to be done on the version 5 module.
Anyway, some more testing, as you suggested, would be great.
The only other question is what to do about the cacheing of mount failures 
which has never worked by the look of it. We can remove it or fix it.
