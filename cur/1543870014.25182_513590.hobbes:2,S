This is a very common pattern - for example, shoving characters down a uart
or a parport.  Nobody else has needed to invent new locking infrastructure
to do such things and I'd prefer not to do so now.
Can you not do things more conventionally within that driver?  Use
waitqueues for sleeping with timeout, use a spinlock for serialisation
against the device registers.  There are squillions of examples in
drivers/*, surely.
