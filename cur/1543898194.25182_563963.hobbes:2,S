At this point I'm seriously considfering your previous suggestion:
   Had you considered changing the API so that you don't need the
   compatibility wrapper at all? Could you take an integer number of
   µS or ms instead of a struct timespec?
Maybe I can define a special struct for exchanging time data as:
   struct pps_timedata_s {
      long sec;
      long nsec;
   }
and managing time data conversions at userland...
What do you think about that? :)
Thanks,
Rodolfo
