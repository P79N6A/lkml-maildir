I agree with you.

To me it should be handled as 'paravirt devices', 'paravirt chipset',
etc. If we use the standard H/W detection mechanism (such as CPUID, I/O
port, etc.) used by the native kernel, we should be able to extend the
kernel cleanly (or just add device drivers). And the key here is to
define the behavior of such pseudo (or fake) H/W as we do for actual
H/W. Then 'the paravirt ABI' is the set of (high-level) operations for
such fake H/W devices.
