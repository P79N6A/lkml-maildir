Okay.  What's going on is that info->close_wait is non-zero and 'active',
but (*info->close_wait)->task is 0x1!  __wake_up then trips over it when
we say 'wake_up_interruptible(&info->close_wait)'.
I can't see any way that can ever happen.  (*info->close_wait)->task must
always be 8k-aligned, since it's always set to current whenever it's set.
Tim.
