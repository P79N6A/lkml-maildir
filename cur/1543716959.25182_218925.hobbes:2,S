I was not aware of this problem, the driver is slow to recognize the
link status of the interface and often needs sending some packets before
switching to link status on. But on my sis900 (on a laptop) I never
observed a behavior similar to yours.
The patch I submitted is a small fix in the power management code, so
it's very unlikely that it fixes anything in the link detection,
please also note that the patch is for kernels 2.6.x.
The driver in 2.6 has some small differencies that probably are fixes
never backported, is the driver in 2.4 also broken for other people ?
Are you using the 2.6 or 2.4 driver ?
Thanks for the feedback.
