The keyboard layer abstracts out up/down events, repeat key
functionality and extensions in the normal case. You can put the
keyboard into raw mode and do the work yourself (X does this) and then
feed the results to an application using a pseudo-terminal (see man
openpty).
For networks you are somewhat screwed as the network protocols have
their own timing info and most (telnet, ssh etc) don't pass key up/down
info and batch characters when appropriate. X events might be usable
this way.

Write a new keyboard driver for the new keyboard you've built. PC
hardware can't do it but we already support keyboard drivers for a
variety of devices and PDAs which are different to the PC world.
