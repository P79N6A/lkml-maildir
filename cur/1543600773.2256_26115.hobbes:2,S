Hi,
Finally I can report that problem after many testings.
System: i810 graphic chipset, intel celeron 400Mhz;
128 Mb ram. Lucent software modem using lt-modem
driver version 5-99b
Linux: 2.4.9 ... together all ac series with new dri
module for XFree 4.1.0
XFree86 4.1.0 (slackware)
Problem description: system lockup when exitting
XFree86 when the internet connection is active.
How to reproduce:
connect to the internet using pppd. Do not disconnect.
then logout gnome or shuttdown/reboot the computer
using halt/reboot. usually I will get the text console
; but now I dont. no keys work ; no hard disk
activity, can not power off using computer button,
have to unplug the power cord.
If I disconnect ppp0 before logout gnome / or
halt/reboot, it doesn't happen.
If I compile the kernel but not choosing build new
modules for xfree 4.1.0 ; choose the old one (in ac
series), no problem at all
More infomation on request.
