I don't think so. The library can do such conversions (and alsa-lib does) 
quite easy. If we have a possibility to remove the code from the kernel 
space without any drawbacks, then it should be removed. I don't see any 
advantage to have such conversions in the kernel.

Bad decision. Again, I feel you're hidding the flexibility against
your feeling that the kernel API is the best enough for applications.
Imagine that the API redirection is or can be also flexible for your 
future development.

Stream mixing. We have user space solution while you insist to put this 
code to kernel. Simply, we need to go through our library.
From the end user perspective, don't you think that having an opportunity 
to change the API entry point from one to multiple (user space library - 
preferred, direct kernel space - last resort) is more flexible for 
developers and users? Please, consider this question without any flames 
line which API is better and what's better for audio subsystem architects 
and what's better for your commercial work.
