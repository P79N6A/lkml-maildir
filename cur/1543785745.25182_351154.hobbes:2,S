IIRC, that used to be the case, but isn't anymore.

This is *completely* wrong.  The kernel used to lock_kernel() for  
*every* ioctl.  Recent changes added locked and unlocked ioctls, such  
that ioctls that do not need the BKL can ignore it completely.  You  
claimed to have read the code, given this typical Wrongbot statement,  
I guess I can say for sure that you didn't.

PS:  Use a different email service!  Your "I tried to kill it with  
the above dot" and bullshit apology is worth zilch.  A quick  
calculation shows that over the last month and a half, you have
sent 76 or so emails to the list, all of which have contained your  
useless 663-byte corporate message, meaning you have sent 50K of spam  
to the list over that time period, which has been distributed to  
several thousand accounts by vger, resulting in probably over 100MB  
of spam over that time period.  Fix it or use a different email account!
I am not the intended recipient for the following email text.  I will  
destroy all copies of this information, including further copies of
