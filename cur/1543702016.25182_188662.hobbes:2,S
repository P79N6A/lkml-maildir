True, but...  Let me put it that way - entire area is a minefield and
I would really like to avoid nasty surprises from "obvious" patches,
what with having just spent 4 months dealing with the fallout from one
such beast.
Let's clean the things up first; then it will be easier to see what can
and should be done.  Sure thing, reducing amount of places that deal with
device numbers is a good thing.  Let's see how far we can get it, what
obstacles still remain (and during 2.5 a _lot_ of them had been killed)
and what is needed to remove the rest.
Once they are gone (and that will be one-by-one, keeping the list of
things to grep for and checking the results of greps as we go) - then
we'll have cleaner playing field for any experiments in that area.
_And_ there will be less temptation to play the bundling games for
everyone involved (cf. devfs disaster, aka. "my glorious idea allows
to do $NEEDED_THING that way; merge the entire thing and nevermind
the fact that doing $NEEDED_THING essentially the same way is possible
without the rest of patch and can be split out of it").
