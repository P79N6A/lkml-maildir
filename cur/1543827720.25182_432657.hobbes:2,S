Sorry, misinformation on my side. The kernel uses the FD_foo versions,
not the __FD_foo ones, so I did not find them at first.
It's only used in fs/open.c though, and I wonder if that could just
use the bitops versions directly, as these are more likely to be
optimized well for a given architecture.
