I suspect this is the default for the vast majority of kernel developers.
Perhaps it's only worth special casing those that have an interest in
GPLv3, as the numbers are bound to be far lower -- if this sort of thing
is judged to be a good idea, that is (It's rather interesting to note
that the vast majority of GPLv3 advocates don't even have a single
changeset in the kernel, yet still feel that their input on kernel
licensing is somehow relevant or valid).
