I added support for match register based devices and you want to do
something like this:
static int hpet_next_event(unsigned long delta,
                           struct clock_event_device *evt)
{
        unsigned long cnt;
        cnt = hpet_readl(HPET_COUNTER);
        cnt += delta;
        hpet_writel(cnt, HPET_T0_CMP);
        return ((long)(hpet_readl(HPET_COUNTER) - cnt ) > 0);
}
The generic code takes care of the already expired event.
