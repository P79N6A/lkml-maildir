Yes. The accessor for the scheduler is defined for each arch in topology.c

Slight differences exist on each platform. I already have enough trouble 
here right now to deal with the x86_64 overlap into i386. There are 
numerous other x86 specific maps that will have to be treated the same way 
and they are all handled in arch specific files.
Core cpu and node maps exist in the page allocator and are defined in 
nodemask.h and cpumask.h. I have recently introduced a framework that 
allows the definition of new masks that could be used in the future to 
abstract these out of the arches (See the memoryless node patchees). But 
that work has not been merged yet and is likely going to be a separate 
project.
