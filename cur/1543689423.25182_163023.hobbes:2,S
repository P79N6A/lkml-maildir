inb() and friends are for ISA/PCI I/O space
isa_readb() and friends are for ISA memory space
readb() and friends are for PCI memory space (after ioremap())
That's why other buses (e.g. SBUS and Zorro) have their own versions of
ioremap() and readb() etc.).
Life would be much easier with bus-specific I/O ops...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
