Excuse me, but I never said such a thing.  I don't mind putting firmware
blobs into kernel drivers, been doing it for years :)
I just stated that _if_ we want to move firmware to userspace, why not
have a consistant interface that all kinds of drivers can use to
accomplish this.  That is what has been done with this code.
