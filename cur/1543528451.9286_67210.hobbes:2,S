I had a quick look at the ext3 code, and I could not find any sort of
check whether the journal was a "valid" file or not.  I would hate to
accidentally give "2" or some other inode as the journal, and then ext3
happily overwrites it.  Maybe there should be a check that the first
block (or the whole file) is zero-filled (if it is a new journal) or
that there is a magic number at the start.
If this is already in the code and I missed it, please carry on...
Cheers, Andreas
