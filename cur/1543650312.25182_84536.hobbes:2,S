Hi,
  I was just going through its implementation. If mlockall() is invoked
with MCL_FUTURE, does it mean that all the existing locked mappings of
process should get unlocked ? Attaching code segment from do_mlockall().
I am using 2.4.18 kernel
static int do_mlockall(int flags)
{
   ...
                newflags = vma->vm_flags | VM_LOCKED;
                if (!(flags & MCL_CURRENT))
                        newflags &= ~VM_LOCKED;
                error = mlock_fixup(vma, vma->vm_start, vma->vm_end,
newflags);
   ...
}
please cc me.
thanks
Amol
