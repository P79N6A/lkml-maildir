It's exactly the same as a file system.  If you put some files into a
file system does the file system creator owe you the knowledge of how
those files are maintained in the file system?  Since when is that part
of the deal?  Does that mean that I can insist you provide me with a
detailed specification, without an attached GPL, of how GCC works so I
can clone the technology into my commercial compiler?  
It's the same with any software package.  I know Red Hat uses Oracle,
why aren't you telling Oracle to disclose how Oracle works inside?
Is it possible that Red Hat signed a license agreement that prevents
them from accessing that information?  You bet it is.  Did Oracle trick
Red Hat into agreeing to this awful arrangement?  No, they spelled it
out in their license and Red Hat signed it.
What's going on here is no different than Red Hat deciding they don't
want to pay for Oracle so they are reverse engineering Oracle and
transferring the technology into MySQL.

We're the only vendor I've ever heard of who provides a mirror of
the data in a competing free product.  Does Oracle do that for you?
Of course not.  But somehow we are the bad guys locking you in?  OK, if
your position is that we are locking you in then you'd have no problem
if we dropped the CVS gateway, that's of no value to you, right?  And we
rate limit the web interface so you can't get your patches without BK,
that's of no value either, right?

You are missing the point that there are two licenses.  Roman is trying
to tell us to change our license.  The point you missed was that that's
the same as me telling you to change the GPL for my benefit.
