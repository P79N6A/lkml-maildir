btw., still ianal, but the GPLv2 is not a "contract" but a "pure 
copyright license". A contract, almost by definition is a restriction of 
rights in exchange for consideration - while if you accept the license 
of a GPLv2-ed work this act only gives rights that you did not have 
before. Furthermore when you get source code of free software then there 
is no "meeting of minds" needed for you to accept the GPL's conditions, 
and only the letter of the license (and, in case of any ambiguities, the 
intent of the author of the code) matters to the interpretation of the 
license, not the intent of the recipient. (while in contract cases both 
the meeting of minds is needed and the intent and understanding of both 
parties matters to the interpretation of the contract.)
