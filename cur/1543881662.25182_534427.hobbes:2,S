I think that's good for normal things, but it's not unreasonable to
want to map > 4 GB of memory at once for an Infiniband device.
So maybe we would want some heuristics about the size of the mapping
being requested or the amount of 32-bit space left to decide whether a
mapping should be below 4 GB.
