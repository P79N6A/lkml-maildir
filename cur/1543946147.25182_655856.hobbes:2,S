Yes, but generally not any P5+ system is going to need the PIT delay in the 
first place meaning it just doesn't matter. There were the VIA issues with 
the PIC but unless I missed it not with the PIT.
That's the point. It's fairly unclean to say udelay(2) and then not delay 
for 2 microseconds but you _have_ done the two short jumps meaning 386 and 
486 systems are okay and later systems were okay to start with.
