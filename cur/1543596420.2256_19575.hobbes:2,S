No.  In user context, at least for user data pages, the highmem pages
can be mapped into the local process's user page tables and we don't
need kmap to access them at all.  kmap is only needed for pages which
are not already in the user page tables, such as when accessing the
page cache in read or write syscalls.

No, user processes never access kmap addresses.  They have direct page
table access to highmem pages in their address space.  Only the kernel
uses kmap, and only for pages which are not in the calling process's
local page tables already.  So we don't have to worry about keeping
kmap and page tables consistent --- they are totally different address
spaces, and the kmap virtual addresses are not visible to user
processes.
Cheers,
 Stephen
