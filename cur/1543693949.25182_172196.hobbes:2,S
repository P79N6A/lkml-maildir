It could be done "on demand".  So get_user_pages() and the /proc code will
call the new add_fixmap_vma() on entry.  Hence the additional overhead is
only incurred when /proc/pid/maps is accessed, or get_user_pages() is
called.
It'll need a new flag in mm_struct.  mm_struct.swap_address can be
salvaged: it is no longer used.
