Oh this common missconception that embedded system equals small systems.
There are embedded systems that outrun supercomputers without sweating,
have gigs of RAM and sometimes if you look at them closly even have the
names of well known big iron companies on their boards.  The whole
embedded term is just so weakly defined and everybody seem to have his
personal definition.
