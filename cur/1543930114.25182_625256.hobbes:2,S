Um, trying to clarify:  S390.  Also known as zSeries, big iron machine, uses 
its own weird processor design rather than x86, x86-64, arm, or mips 
processors.
How does "struct page" enter into this?
What I want to know is, are you saying execute in place doesn't work on things 
like arm and mips?  (I so, I was unaware of this.  I heard about somebody
