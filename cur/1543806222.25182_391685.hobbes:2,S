James - NACK this patch.
I noticed you have picked up this patch in your scsi-rc-fixes stream.

There is a mistake with this patch.  This SAS1078 device id (0x62) is
the same
id we are claiming for our fusion drivers. Our device ID is 0x62.  You
can see
that at this link: 
http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/iii/?i=10000062.
  I haven't got
around
to it, but I plan to post support for that soon.
A different version of SAS1078 is being manufactured by the megaraid
group.  
Neela Syam Kolli is aware of this issue, and I believe they are working
out the details, 
and will be posting a patch to solve this.
Can this patch be backed out if its not fixed before 2.6.16 kernel is
released.
