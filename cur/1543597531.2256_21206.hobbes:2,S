Right.
The macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC is used for AT_CLKTCK, and for some architectures
there actually _is_ a relationship between CLOCKS_PER_SEC and HZ, and for
some there is _not_ (linux/include/asm-*/param.h).
For i386 the relation apparently _is_ there. For IA64 there's the assumption
however that that the relation is _not_ there, the kernel assumes that it's
100 HZ for ia32 _always_. Weird.
Still leaves me wondering about procps.
Thanks,
Rolf

Then your kernel is broken, check AT_CLKTCK,
