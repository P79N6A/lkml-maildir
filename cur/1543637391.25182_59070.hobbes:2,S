Yes, but the code actually is only this fix.

No, I worked on this code really hard for some time.
Just got tired listening to flacky ideas and syncing against
intendation/whitespaces changes.
The biggest problem with IDE is not code or dissing people,
but _the way_ of changes...
And the thing I dislike is how people who apparently haven't read
carefully every ide-clean patch, and didn't bother to look up the full
track of changes (2.4 -> 2.5) feel that they are perfectly fine to make
such statements ;-).

Linus, please don't add me to .killmail for this mail yet :-).
It is really _the last_ mail on this subject.
Yep, I did too much of this dissing lately...
...and it was really not needed.
