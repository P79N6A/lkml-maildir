Couldn't get 2.3.11 to boot with the vesafb mode switching enabled, so
I turned it off to see if there were any messages I might be able to
see with the console remaining in text mode.  Looks like something
weird going on with memory sizeing/usage at boot time.  I'm getting
"Out of memory -- System halted".
I seem to remember some discussion about making sure binutils was
current: I'm using 2.9.1.0.25.  Anything else I should know about?
