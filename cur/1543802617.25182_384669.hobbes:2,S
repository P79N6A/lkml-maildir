Minor thing: from my reading of v9fs_mux_rpc() there's potential for a
double-kfree here.  Either v9fs_mux_rpc() needs to be changed to
unambiguously zero out *rcall (or, better, v9fs_t_read does it) or you need
to zero fcall on each go around the loop.

if (result < rsize), is the page really up to date?

eww, do you really indent labels like that?

That's a really scary function you have there.  Can you explain the
thinking behind its use here?  What are we trying to achieve?
