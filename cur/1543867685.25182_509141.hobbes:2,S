All the security stuff in the kernel should provide the necessary means to 
restrict this system call.

Exactly and as long as there are these holes, these patches are only 
kernel bloat. The simple verification can also be done in userspace and 
module signing offers no real security.
What real value do these patches provide, that can't be reached via other 
means? Who else than distributions would be interested in this? Pretty 
much any use you initially mentioned can be done in simpler ways, e.g. 
anyone afraid of modules simply disables module loading completely.
bye, Roman
