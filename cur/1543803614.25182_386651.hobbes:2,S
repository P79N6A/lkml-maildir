Could you add some help text over here? At first glance I got the
impression this was a host driver that works through ACPI calls, but by
reading the rest of your patches it turns out it is a suspend/resume
helper.
For quite some time we had no help text with the mysterious
"ACPI0004,PNP0A05 and PNP0A06 Container Driver", no need to add another
mysterious ACPI feature.
