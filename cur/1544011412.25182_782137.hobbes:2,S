FS-Cache might.  CacheFiles probably doesn't.
There've been discussions about a separate caching backend to deal with
non-rotating media such as large chunks of battery-backed RAM or flash.
FS-Cache might make sense in such a situation as these could be accessed in
other ways (such as through MTD or even directly).
I'll make CONFIG_CACHEFILES dependent on CONFIG_BLOCK.
