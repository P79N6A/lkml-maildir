From what I've heard, the reason Intel _really_ wants "rep nop" is that
without it the CPU will heat up quite efficiently (that's what you do
when you want to run at an eventual 2GHz with all cylinders firing all
the time), causing thermal meltdown on non-thermally protected CPU's and
CPU speed throttling on the ones that _are_ thermally protected (which
will obviously have to be all the shipping ones). 
And the thermal throttling will severly cripple performance.

Intel retroactively defined it for all their CPU's. And I very strongly
suspect that every single other x86 CPU vendor does the same. Why not?
They get a new instruction for free, but just documenting it. Maybe they
can sell the same old chip with a new name ("The Xxxxx Wonderchip. Now
with documetned 'rep nop' support! Get one today!").
