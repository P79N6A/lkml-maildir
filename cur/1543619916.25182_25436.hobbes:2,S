Thanks.  I'd missed that.

That one I suspected.  (I used the TFTP setup on solaris and power PC years 
ago, just didn't know if x86 bioses had caught up.  Most of my BIOS 
experience in the past few years has been with Dell machines, so my 
expectations may have been unnecessarily lowered... :)  On the other hand, 
very few systems in the field seem to boot and install entirely through the 
network unless they're meant to be diskless...
