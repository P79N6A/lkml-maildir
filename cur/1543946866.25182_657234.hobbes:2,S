There was one call made anyway, it's a bit hard to see how it would hurt 
to push that BUG() deeper down (in fact, this is one of the easiest case 
in this respect, many other cases elsewhere that need uninlining don't 
currently make any calls with inlines).

IMHO it is definately better solution for archiving the size reduction,
I just didn't know before that the only sctp_add_cmd call could be 
converted.

This won't be a necessary note anymore. :-)
