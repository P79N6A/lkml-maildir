The change was discussed on netdev before it went in. The
old behaviour was a security problem, so this change, which
breaks tunnel setups without forward policies, had to be
made. This will hopefully not happen again, but if you have
problems with IPsec and suspect a kernel bug, write to
netdev@oss.sgi.com.
