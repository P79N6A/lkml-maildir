Manish Lachwani mentioned to me that he faced the same issue
with the MIPS RT support and that when he discussed
it with Ingo that the solution was for include/asm-ppc/tlb.h
to include/asm-generic/tlb-simple.h when PREEMPT_RT is turned on.
The patch does this for the #ifdef CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU case,
but not for the #else case.  I don't know which case is used
for the Ampro board.

I am glad to see the instrumentation and measurement related code
in your patch.  (My patch of last week ("Frank's patch") is lacking
that code.)
Other differences between the two patches are:
arch/ppc/syslib/i8259.c
    Frank neglected to convert i8259_lock to a raw spinlock.
arch/ppc/kernel/signal.c
    John added an enable of irqs in do_signal()  #ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
arch/ppc/kernel/traps.c
    John added an enable of irqs and preempt_check_resched() in _exception().
various files
    Frank added the intrusive variable tb_to_us for use by cycles_to_usec()
    and added an ugly #ifdef in cycles_to_usec().
    John hard-coded cpu_khz for one specific board so that no change would
    be needed in cycles_to_usec().
various files
    John has the mmu_gather fix that is described above.
John's patch and Frank's patch are otherwise mostly the same, except for
the differences that result from being based on different kernel
versions.  I am glad to see that because it means that two sets of
eyes have agreed.
Frank's patch may have missed some EXPORT_SYMBOL()s in arch/ppc/lib/locks.c.
I'll check those over again tomorrow.
