Correct.  And irrelevant.

Correct, but incomplete.

Always do.
Exercise:
	1) what type does an integer constant 0xdeadbeef have on a platform
with INT_MAX equal to 0x7fffffff and UINT_MAX equal to 0xffffffff?
	2) when does the situation differ for integer constant 3735928559?
Oh, and do read the part of C standard in question.  Hint: extra restrictions
are placed on decimal constants, not on the octals and hexadecimals.
