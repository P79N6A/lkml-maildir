a hardware context switch is basically a CR3 change with associated tlb
flush. That is the part that is the most expensive of a context switch.
Just going into the kernel and getting out with a different EIP/ESP is
really cheap, in the order of "a few hundred cycles"; not a heck of a
lot more expensive than a simple getpid or other simple system call.

it includes a privilege level switch, not so much a full context
switch...
