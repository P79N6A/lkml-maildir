I think the "child reaper" question is not related to the (container,pid)
approach or the vpid approach. This is another question on who is the
parent of a container and how does it behaves.
We have choosen to first follow a simple "path", complete pid isolation
being the main constraint : a container is created by exec'ing a process in
it. That first process is detached from its parent processes and becomes
child of init (already running), session leader, and process group leader.
We could eventually add a daemon to act as a init process for the container.
Now, there are other ways of seeing a container parenthood, openvz, eric,
vserver, etc. We should agree on this or find a way to have different model
cohabitate.
