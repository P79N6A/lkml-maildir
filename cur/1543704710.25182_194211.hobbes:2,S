Hello,
	It seems that many files [1] in the Linux source have lines with
trailing blank (space and tab) characters and some even have formfeed
characters. Obviously these blank characters aren't necessary.
	I wonder if it is a waste of time to send patches that clean the
source? Those patches will only remove those trailing blank characters and
will be splitted by maintainer.
Regards,
	Rui Saraiva
