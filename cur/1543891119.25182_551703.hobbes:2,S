ok, let's go this way.
Cornelia, afaict your patch has no actual delendency upon Dan's
dma-mapping-prevent-dma-dependent-code-from-linking-on.patch, correct?  If
so, I can merge it via James and then merge Dan's patch once James has
merged.
If there is a dependency then I guess I merge both into a single diff and
merge it all in one hit.
btw, this:

We don't really need the ifdefs here.  If someone incorrectly calls these
functions then they'll get a link-time failure anyway.  The downside of
removing these ifdefs is that they won't get a compile-time warning, but I
tend to think that this small cost is worth it.
