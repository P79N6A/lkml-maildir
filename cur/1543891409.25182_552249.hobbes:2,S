Hi,
This is the second revision of the patches that introduce hibernation and
suspend notifiers.
Generally, I have followed the Alan's suggestion to use a blocking notifier
chain and the Pavel's suggestion to limit the number of events.  Also, I've
dropped the patch to disable the requesting of firmware.
Comments welcome.
Greetings,
Rafael
