Well I've recoded the poll() section in the ircu code base as follows:
Instead of the default :
    ...
    nfds = poll(poll_fds, pfd_count, timeout);
    ...
we now have
    ...
    nfds = poll(poll_fds, pfd_count, 0);
    if (nfds == 0) {
      usleep(1000000 / 10); /* sleep 1/10 second */
      nfds = poll(poll_fds, pfd_count, timeout);
    }
    ...
And as 'top' results now show, instead of maxing out a dual P3-800 we now
only use a fraction of that without any noticable side effects.
