well, i meant the Windows kernel itself, not applications. (maybe the 
Windows kernel uses it on SMP systems where the TSC /used to be/ pretty 
stable, i dont know)

that's not a problem - time goes as fast as light [by definition] :-)

no, it doesnt, so there's no real friction here. We just observed that 
in the past 10 years no generally working TSC-based gettimeofday was 
written (and i wrote the first version of it for the Pentium, so the 
blame is on me too), and that we might be better off without it. If 
someone can pull off a working TSC-based gettimeofday() implementation 
then there's no objection from us.
