TUN/TAP driver relies on the network core to do module reference counting. 
It doesn't really do any cleanup in module_exit(). Module refcounting was 
recently removed from the network core which apparently broke TUN/TAP 
driver. btw 'misc' driver doesn't do any ref counting either.
I'll try to spend some time on it this week and fix both misc and TUN driver.
