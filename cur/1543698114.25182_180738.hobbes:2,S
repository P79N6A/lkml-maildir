It's not like that. People get boxes whatever way they were imaged, etc.  
Most don't know anything about the internals. And when they want to make it
dualboot with Linux, they might find they can't boot anymore.
Do you also really believe this oldfashioned means is the only way to end
up in problems because of partitioning tools change CHS units?

OK, thanks, the problem is here. Maybe a warning could be added when the
geometry can't be guessed (if the warning isn't there already)?
