What about killing fasync_helper altogether and using the method that
epoll uses to register "listeners" which send a signal when the poll
state of a device changes?
That would trim off code all over the place, make the fast paths a
little bit faster (in the case that there aren't any listeners), and
most importantly make SIGIO reliable for every kind of file descriptor,
instead of the pot luck you get now.
Just an idea :)
