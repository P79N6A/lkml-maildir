It sort of is.  Through the /proc filesystem, the kernel provides a path 
through which to open any arbitrary file descriptor, thus providing 
the "path" argument that the exec syscall requires.

You need /proc mounted in the new chroot for it to work.  It's not a complete 
solution, but an incremental improvement over the previous hack.
Of course today what you can do is copy busybox into the top directory of the 
new chroot directory, execute that via the standard chroot command, 
run "/busybox mount -n -t procfs /proc /proc", and then let the 
current /proc/self/exe logic handle things from there.  (Or configure busybox 
to use /busybox instead of /proc/self/exe as the re-exec-self path.)
