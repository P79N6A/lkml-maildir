Yes, but even though you have defined a per-channel spinlock, you're using
only the general spinlock (i.e., the one that locks the whole card). I'm
trying to avoid this, as the Cyclom-Y can have up to 32 ports (devices)
and locking the whole board because of one port doesn't seem like a good
idea.
Actually, I know the very basics of how to define and use spinlocks, but
I'd like to get a more solid knowledge on this before I go for it
"officially".
So ... any pointers to good books, URLs or src code on the subject,
anybody ?!?!!
Thanks again for your help.
Regards,
Ivan
