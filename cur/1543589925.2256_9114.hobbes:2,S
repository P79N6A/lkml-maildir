Subject: scan_scsis limits LUNs to max_scsi_luns... is this what we want?

In the routine  scan_scsis(),  The following code would appear to limit 
the number of luns a given apapter can use to max_scsi_luns, as opposed 
to the limit the low-level driver passed in the Scsi_Host structure.
Is that the behaviour we want? or should the '<' become a '>' in the ternary, 
thereby scanning the greater of the passed max_lun or the system max_scsi_luns.
It seems to me that if a low level driver passes a large number of luns, 
the midlayer should accept that value.
Of course, the use of the CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN #define would lead me to 
believe that the kernel does indeed want to limit the number of luns probed 
to the lesser of the two values... but why?? 
	max_dev_lun = (max_scsi_luns < shpnt->max_lun ?
		max_scsi_luns : shpnt->max_lun);
	sparse_lun = 0;
	for (lun = 0; lun < max_dev_lun; ++lun) {
		if (!scan_scsis_single(channel, order_dev, lun, &max_dev_lun,
			&sparse_lun, &SDpnt, shpnt,
			scsi_result)
			&& !sparse_lun) break;
	}
