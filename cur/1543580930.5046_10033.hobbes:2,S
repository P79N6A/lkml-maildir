Hi all,
System: kernel 2.4.1 util-linux-2.10r cdrecord-1.9 modutils-2.3.21
I have a cd writer and a cdrom in the same pc. When the kernel has SCSI
support compiled as a module, cdrecord doesn't find anything (hdb=ide-scsi
is passed with lilo). When is compiled with built-in scsi support, the
writer is detected, but here comes the strange problem: if i try to mount
any disc in the cdrom, mount spits that:
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=16:40, iso_blknum=16, block=32
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/dvd,
       or too many mounted file systems
       (could this be the IDE device where you in fact use
       ide-scsi so that sr0 or sda or so is needed?)
Then if I unload the ide-scsi.o mod, mount works fine. I don't know why
ide-scsi module is detecting my ide cdrom as a scsi device if the only
parameter passed to the kernel is "hdb=ide-scsi" (cd writer).
And why doesn't work cdrecord when scsi support is loaded as a module?
None of these problems happens when using 2.2.18. Both drives work fine
together, with all the scsi modules and stuff.
