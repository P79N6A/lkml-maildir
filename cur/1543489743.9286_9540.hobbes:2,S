From driver point of view, the instance of the 895 has no relationship
with the 810a one. A bug is always possible, but I doubt the problem would
be due to a bug.
LVD devices are in fact LVD/SE devices.
  LVD = low-voltage-differential  (FAST40 a.k.a. Ultra2)
  SE  = single-ended              (FAST20 a.k.a. Ultra)
All the devices on the SCSI BUS are sensing the DIFFSENS signal level and
will switch to SE mode if this signal indicates that at least 1 device on
the SCSI BUS is operating in SE mode, then limiting data transfer speed to
FAST20.
So, in order to use LVD signaling and then to get 80 MB/s sync wide data
transfers on your SCSI BUS, you must ensure the following: 
- All devices including the controller are LVD capable and configured for
  this signaling (is such an option is possible).
- All terminators (2) are LVD capable or LVD/SE (same behaviour as
  other devices).
- All the cables meet the requirements for LVD.
You also must:
- Configure the driver for 40 MHz sync data transferts. Or tell it so at
  boot-up using 'ncr53c8xx=sync:10', if the driver has been configured for 
  slower sync data transfers.
- Configure your LVD devices for 80 MB/s data transfers in the SYMBIOS 
  user set-up (NVRAM).
It seems that LVD drive internal terminations are not LVD/SE but only SE.
So, if any drive has its SE internal terminator enabled, then all the
devices on the SCSI BUS will switch to SE mode, and the SCSI BUS will
operate in FAST20 mode. 
Hope this will help.
Regards,
   Gérard.
PS: the driver should probably print out the SCSI mode which is currently 
    operating on the BUS. I will add such a message in the next drivers' 
    versions.
