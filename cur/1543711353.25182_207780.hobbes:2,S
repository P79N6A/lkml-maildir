HPT374-ide chip seems to work OK only after applying the patch
Andre Hedrick sent a month ago (and a newer version today, it seems).
Without that patch HPT374 support is very flaky in a host with
heavy I/O. I have tested the first version of the above mentioned
patch for a couple of weeks without problems (mostly 2.4.25+patch kernel).
