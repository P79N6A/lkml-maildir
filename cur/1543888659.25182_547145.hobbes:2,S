I see what you mean.  I see it as "a data dependency barrier ..." though.  That
may be because I wrote the doc, however.  I wonder if "data dependency" should
be hyphenated to make it clearer.  What do you think?

I'm emphasising a really odd feature - and it's quite an important emphasis -
so I felt that this sort of construct would interrupt the reader's normal
scanning of the text and make it clearer that this was something to take
careful note of.
It's a really horrible gotcha you have to be careful of.  It's sort of against
how you'd think things would work.

I know what you mean, but it's tricky because of the subject.  Maybe a colon
after the "might perceive as"?

How about: "Aargh!  Nonono!  The English language is completely horrible!"?
