	This is what I want to accomplish in my proposal to
pull most of the DMA transfer optimization code up from block
devices by generalizing DMA targets and turning struct scatterlist
into a linked list, discussed here:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=102487685000002&r=1&w=2
	I have not started coding this yet because:
	1. I'm tracking down a bug in the next revision of my proposed
	   bio_append patch (which eliminates {read,write}_full_page from
	   fs/buffers.c), and I want to hit that ball out of my court first.
	2. I want to look at aio to see if it has a better way or if it
	   could benefit from this.
	3. I want to accomodate Dave Miller's request for a non-PCI
	   generalization of pci_alloc_consistent, pci_map_single, etc.,
	   first, and that will depend on struct device, for which there are
	   some relevant changes working their way from Patrick Mochel
	   to Linus.
	4. After getting a general dma_alloc_consistent, etc. interface,
	   then I want to create a struct dma_target, to abstract
	   out the DMA capabilities currently maintained by the block
	   layer.  I hope that by doing this in stages, that it will be
	   more palatable to Jens, who expressed concern that the
	   my proposal to go to a linked list for struct scatterlist
	   was a bit too much change.
	Then, I think we'll be in a better position to go to a struct
scatterlist linked list or something similar that can be used by most
if not all big producers of IO.
	In the meantime, killing off kiobufs should be helpful.
