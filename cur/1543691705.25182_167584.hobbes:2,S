Talking of which, how hard would it be to fix make clean and make
modules_install for this ?
Current make clean with SUBDIRS set still cleans out the entire kernel
tree, and modules_install wipes out the entire target modules directory.
It would be nice to see at least the latter fixed so there's a simple
way for building modules against 2.6 series (especially since it's
already way nicer than the contortions for 2.2 and 2.4).
