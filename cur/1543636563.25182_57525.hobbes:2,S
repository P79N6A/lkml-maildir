seems fairly obvious what's happening with a couple of printks...
    printk("visual_init: sw = %p, conswitchp = %p, currcons = %d, init = %d\n",
                    sw, conswitchp, currcons, init);
gets me the interesting fact that sw & conswitchp are both NULL.
later on, we call:
    sw->con_init(vc_cons[currcons].d, init);
which seems like it would be the exact cause, no?
now whether putting a:
	if (!sw)
		return;
call into visual_init or whether we should determine earlier never to
call visual_init, I don't know.  The people who know about the console
have been conspicuously silent so far...
