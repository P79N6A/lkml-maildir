Han,s how'as the work progressing on removing these and other fishy
core changes?
>  reiser4-unstatic-kswapd.patch
Andrew, could you please finally drop this one?  It's not needed for
reiser4 operation at all just for some of their stranger debugging
features.

What about moving fs/Kconfig.reiser4 to fs/reiser4/Kconfig?  This is
the logical place for it and makes dropping in a new version of the fs
easier.
>  reiser4-only.patch
Documentation shouldn't be in fs/FOO/doc but Documentation/filesystems/.
