   I don't care what they're called, but I wanted to bring them up and see what
   everyone thought about how best to implement them, or at least if anyone had
   an objection to adding a "segment" parameter to pci_scan_root.
   I certainly don't have a machine that uses these but some people do, and it
   sounds like it would be nice to handle them in an arch-neutral way.
What exactly doesn't work right now?  I've been using multi-PCI-domain
systems for years under Linux :-)
