Hi guys,
I've done a global patch to kernel 2.3.5 that include my new
schedule() implementation ( try it, gives great benchmarks ! )
and the new implementation of semaphore "up" semantics
( THX to V.Ganesh to have pointed me to the right place to add my code ).
This new code call the new __sem_wake_up() to release only the best task.
This night I'll code a test program that creates N threads competing for
a semaphore with init count equal to 1, and I'll post it on linux-kernel
as long as benchmarks results.
With this email I include the patch and the threads.c ( THX to Willy
Terreau )
program to test the new scheduler ( please report me Your opinion ).
Good work to everyone, cheers,
        Davide.
