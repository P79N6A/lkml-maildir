I've tyred various combinations of ioctl(fd, TCSBRKP, x) and tcsendbreak(fd, 
x), where x is 2, 5, 10, 20 and 200.
One thing I did notice is that no mater what the value I use, it always 
finishes very quickly, there does not appear to be any duration.
take porttest.c:
#include <sys/fcntl.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
main(int argc, char ** argv) {
        int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);
        ioctl(fd, TCSBRKP, 20);
        close(fd);
}
$ time ./porttest /dev/ttyS0
real    0m2.001s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.000s
A standard serial port with a 2 second break (20*100ms), takes as expected 
just over 2 seconds.
$ time ./porttest /dev/ttyUSB1
real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.001s
However with the USB converter instead, it takes 5 ms to complete. Much 
shorter than expected.
Is it a driver issue?
Regards
