Yes. Both for oprofile and the NMI watchdog (which was firing awfully
often last time I checked). The handler needs to be as streamlined as
possible.

Reporting what ? from where ?

You are using the xchg()s in an attempt to thread onto/off the list
safely no ?

If we had that for every API or API change, the kernel would be mostly
HAVE_*. It's either available or it's not. If you're maintaining an
external module, then autoconf or similar is the proper way to check for
its existence.

Believe me, I know :)

If it's possible (and I have no idea, not having looked at RCU at all)
it seems the right way.
