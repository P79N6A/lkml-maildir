  I am just talking general now, but it seems to me that there have
  been many suggestions on user-land solutions like shared librares
  and so forth just to say there is no need for file streams and
  plugins. Many of these ideas do exist in one way or another, but
  none is truly system wide and and as application independent as 
  file streams+plugins would be. Would it not be much less effort to
  implement these in a good way, than trying to reinvent lots of new
  stuff in userland - that wouldn't be systemwide anyway?
