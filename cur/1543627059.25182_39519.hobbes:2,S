I really don't like all the hacks related to the palette in 15/16/32bpp 
mode. You shouldn't affect whatever palette gets passed from userland or
apps that rely on full access to the gamma table will fail. Also, iirc,
the chip's palette in 16 bits mode is 64 entries and 32 in 15 bpp, you
can verify this by seeing how much entries get passed by xfbdev when
it configures the 1:1 color ramp. The old code worked except for the
cursor in console mode which tends to have crazy colors, I think due to
fbdev code brokenness but I'm too sure about that last one.
