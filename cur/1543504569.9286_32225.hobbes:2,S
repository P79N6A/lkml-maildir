Also, note that there has been a severe heat wave in the central and
eastern U.S. for about a week and a half now, putting the daily high
temperature above 100 Fahrenheit / 40 Celsius for large areas of the
midwest and plains.  I had a perfectly good machine with a well worn
kernel start crashing every afternoon as the sun began to beat down
through the windows on the west side of my room.  The symptoms on my
system were Oopsen stating an attempt to kill the idle task and that old
classic, "Aiee, killing the interrupt handler."  Anyone else having this
problem in a hot environment should look into their cooling systems before
they look into the kernel.  Opening up the case and aiming a floor fan in
there worked for me.  I don't know how the weather's been in Europe or
Asia, possibly to similar effect.  Must be nice down on the south side
about now.
