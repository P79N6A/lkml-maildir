	What amazes me is that these legal arguments about the control programmers 
have over their software, are coming from the free software community. If 
Microsoft argued that anybody who wanted to write a program to link with 
Windows system DLLs had to give them 2% of the profits, they'd be blasted by 
the press, yet the free software community wants to argue that programmers 
can't use their APIs if they don't have certain licensing terms?!
	The irony is killing me.
