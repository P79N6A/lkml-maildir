Interesting. My P4 gets basically exactly the same timings for the cmov 
and branch cases.  And my Core 2 is consistently faster (something like 
15%) for the branch version.
Btw, the test-case should be the best possible one for cmov, since there 
are no data-dependencies except for ALU operations, and everything is 
totally independent (the actual values have no data dependencies at all, 
since they are constants). So the critical path issue never show up.
