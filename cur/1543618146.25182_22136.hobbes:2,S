   correct, furthmore it cannot even trigger if you invlpg with an address
   page aligned (4mbyte aligned in this case) like we would always do in
   linux anyways, we never use invlpg on misaligned addresses, no matter if
   the page is a 4M or a 4k page.
That's not true, see the ptrace() helper code.  Russell King pointed
this out to me last week and it's on my TODO list to fix it up.
