ASC/ASCQ of 0x20/0x00 means "Invalid command operation code". So the
drive is rejecting a command sent to it by the driver. If the other
drive that is working is identical to seemingly non-working one, maybe
this drive is going bad. 
st driver prints the SCSI command that may have caused this error only
when compiled with debug turned on. Maybe st driver should always print
the command that results in a check condition as long as the command is
not a Test Unit Ready or Mode Sense.
