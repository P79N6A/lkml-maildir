Found the printk in linux/fs/proc/inode.c, line 251, 
function:  
	struct inode *proc_get_inode(struct super_block * sb, int ino,
                                     struct proc_dir_entry * de)
----------
#if 1
/* shouldn't ever happen */
if (de && de->deleted)
printk("proc_iget: using deleted entry %s, count=%d\n", de->name,
de->count);
#endif
----------
Apparently proc_get_inode got called with a delete inode, called slot5.
That's scary.
Anyway, I can't think of anything that makes a slot5 directory in the 
proc filesystem. BTW alan, I didn't know if you knew where this stemmed
from. That's why I posted this :)
