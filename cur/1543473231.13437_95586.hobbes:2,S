Subject: [2.1.133-5] Quake sound fails only if another audio program runs first.

	On booting to 2.1.133-5, I ran xquake, which worked fine.  I then ran
'mxaudio', an mp3 player which uses /dev/mixer and /dev/dsp, which
worked successfully.  After closing that, I tried to run xquake again
but it failed:
/dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
Could not open /dev/dsp
S_Startup: SNDDMA_Init failed.
Segmentation fault
	However, other audio programs such as mxaudio and 'play' still work.
