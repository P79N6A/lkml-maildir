In theory you can do that already, although the locking is a bit screwed
up for it. Actually all the tty locking is broken for rx I believe.
Everyone should be holding the tty read lock when updating flip buffers
but right now we don't

You can do this now providing you don't do it blindly from IRQ context.

	struct tty_ldisc *ld = tty_ldisc_ref(tty);

	if(ld == NULL)	/* Bin/defer */

	if(count > space) count = space;
	ld->receive_buf(tty, charbuf, flagbuf, count);
There is a corner case if TTY_DONT_FLIP is set where you should queue
but not all drivers do this and the DONT_FLIP hack 'has to die'
