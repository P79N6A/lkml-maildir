Sorry, it seems I made myself not clear enough. I meant, IMHO, a 2.2.15
release of the kernel with the 5.1.28 aic7xxx included is absolutely
necessary, s.t. it ends up on linux distribs as a default. Otherwise I'd
suspect people with aic7xxx cards using some SCSI removables (mod/tape)
for backup like I do will dangerous problems. 
For example, I use the mo disk on another linux system since ages. Thus I
did not expect a single problem and I have some important data archived on
MOD's. If they haven't been write protected (I'm not that stupid...), I'd
completely lost that data due to media change misdetection...
So, I mean, the aic7xxx has DANGEROUS bugs in it.
