Hello,
I've upgraded to 2.6.17-mm3 today, and there is a problem that happens
when kexec is initiliazed
Reiser4[pdflush(170)] commit_current_atom (fs/reiser4/txnmgr.c:1062)[zam-597]
I receive the following every time kexec initializes, then the kernel
panics and crashes. I rebooted to a rescue and ran fsck.reiser4 and it
found a couple of small errors and fixed them. Then I tried it again,
and I got the same thing on kexec initiliazation, except this time the
FS wouldnt boot anymore, and i ran fsck.reiser4 and it came up with a
severe error requiring me to run fsck.reiser4 --build-fs.
A couple other people have also tried it and had the same problem.
2.6.17-mm1 and 2.6.17-mm2 do not have any problems for me.
Any help his appreciated
Thanks
-Brandon
