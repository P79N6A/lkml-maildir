You just map your RT-dependent routine (PIC, of course) into the
segment and move your stack pointer into a second segment. I didn't
say it was easy, but it's all just bits. There's also the rlimit
issue.
Or, going the other way, the client app can pass map handles to the
server to bless. Some juggling might be involved but it's obviously
doable.
As has been pointed out, an rlimit solution exists now as well.
