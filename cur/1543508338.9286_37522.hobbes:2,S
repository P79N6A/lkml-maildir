Sorry if this is an already known problem, but I have just resubscribed
to the list after several months of absence.
I keep getting 'unresolved symbols' in smbfs and scsi modules. It's in
2.3.16 and the same appeared in 2.3.15 and some earlier (at least for
scsi module):
psycho:~# depmod -a
/lib/modules/2.3.16/fs/smbfs.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.3.16/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol(s)
psycho:~# insmod smbfs
/lib/modules/2.3.16/fs/smbfs.o: unresolved symbol get_cached_page
psycho:~# insmod scsi_mod
/lib/modules/2.3.16/scsi/scsi_mod.o: unresolved symbol init_task_union
As I don't know if it's known or not, I don't include my .config now.
