Oh yes, now I remember that it was you who recommened cpuburn to me back
in April/May or so.  I also was suspicious that neither memtest86 nor
cpuburn were really stressful enough, but the large-compiles-in-a-loop
weren't any better for me.  I would _love_ to just have some confident
test to say "yep, your hardware is bad, go buy a shiny new box"  :)
I've seen memtest86 actually find bad RAM on a machine before, so I know
it works _sometimes_.  Can anyone say the same for cpuburn?  What does
a failure look like, and were there correlated symptoms like kernel oopses?
