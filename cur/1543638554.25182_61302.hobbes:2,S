Which LILO version is this?
What do cfdisk -Ps /dev/hda and cfdisk -Pt /dev/hda say?
What are the kernel boot messages for this disk
(dmesg | grep hda), both for 2.5.29 and 2.5.30?
Andries
[lilo-22.3.1 does not print such messages.
Must be from the part_verify() in some older LILO.
Probably some LILO option like "ignore-table" or "linear" or "lba32"
would help. But it is interesting to see where this 1/0/530 comes from.]
