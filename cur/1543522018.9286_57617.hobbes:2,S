No, I am referring to a different problem that I mentioned in the
doc. If you have a large number of free regular pages, and the dma
zone is completely exhausted, the 2.2 decision of balacing the dma
zone might never fetch an "yes" answer, because it is based on total
number of free pages, not also the per zone free pages. Right? Things 
will get worse the more non-dma pages there are.

Oh, okay I see. There is nothing about the dma zone then, you could 
make the balancing more aggressive for the other zones too. Basically,
these kinds of tuning should be controlled by sysctls (instead of 
>>7, do >> N), so while most sites will prefer to run with the least
aggressive balancing, there may be sites with drivers that need 
many high-order pages, they would be willing to sacrifice some 
performance by doing more aggressive balancing. Comes under finetuning 
in the doc.

Oh yes, I was forgetting, that is the reason you need an independent
memory freer in any os. It shouldn't be too hard to teach kswapd about
zones.
