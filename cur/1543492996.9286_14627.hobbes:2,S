I realized after I sent this that I was not clear again.  I went to the
server and created a new file in the same fashion called test1.  So the
files should not have been cached in any form.

I'll take a look but as I said, the files were created from scratch
locally then used.  If you do something again with the file it is
blazingly fast (0.01 seconds) so this is cached.

I've been talking with Trond lately.  With the latest version,
he asked me to try using an nfs mount of a ramdisk on the Solaris
machine.  When I did this, speed was consistent for reads and writes.
That is, the same 4MB file was written in 0.44 seconds and read in
0.52 seconds (I assume the difference here is the speed difference
in local disks between the one on the Solaris machine and my local
machine).  
This leads me to believe that the Solaris local UFS read ahead is somehow
mistimed with the NFS read ahead and thus causing a large delay
on the reads.  This is just a guess and I'm still working on it.
