Of course.  I thought it was something more serious in the bowels of
the kernel.  All the comment needed was just that one adjective "The
*edge-triggered* interrupt of the serial console port can't be
shared."  I know many programmers do not like to write comments, but
good comments make the code more robust and stable:  the code clearly
shows *what* you did, but comments are necessary to indicate *why*.

You will be happy to know that the Intel IOP80321 has level-sensitive
interrupts.
Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Chris.
