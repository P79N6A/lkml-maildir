Not possible on a dedicated DSP? Rubbish. A large number of DSP apps do just this.
You clock the DSP from the same source as the converters. At the start of
execution you sync up to the flow from the data source. After that you use a
processing loop padded so its execution time is precisely related to the sample
interval of the data flowing through. DSP chips usually have deterministic
processing times - no vagueness with caches, and so on. If the processor is fast
enough to leave a few spare processing cycles, its a good idea to do a sync check
each time round the main loop. If not, just live with it!
