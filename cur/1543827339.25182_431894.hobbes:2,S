Quoting you:
"Googling around the only example I could find was someone with a VGA
card and a Hercules card. They setup 8 consoles on each card."
How do you think they accomplished that? They did not rewrite the VT
layer, all they need to do is change the 'first' and 'last' parameter
passed to take_over_console() in mdacon.c.  This implies that the VT
layer already supports multiple active VT console drivers, maybe as
early as 2.2, and no, we won't remove that.
