Subject: [PATCH] [DLM] do full recover_locks barrier
Red Hat BZ 211914
The previous patch "[DLM] fix aborted recovery during
node removal" was incomplete as discovered with further testing.  It set
the bit for the RS_LOCKS barrier but did not then wait for the barrier.
This is often ok, but sometimes it will cause yet another recovery hang.
If it's a new node that also has the lowest nodeid that skips the barrier
wait, then it misses the important step of collecting and reporting the
barrier status from the other nodes (which is the job of the low nodeid in
the barrier wait routine).
