By "applications" I mean boxes which use only NFSv2 and don't do
cacheing.  Could be one somewhere, but maybe we don't care anyway.
BTW some clients will do long term data cacheing if the modtime doesn't
change, even to local disk -- and as the modtime's only set in seconds
on Linux that can happen even after the data has changed.
