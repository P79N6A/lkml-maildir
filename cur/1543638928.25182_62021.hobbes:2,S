OK, fair enough. Would a simpler approach to what you've done be
to do in io.h something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_MULTIQUAD
 #ifdef STANDALONE
  #define xquad_portio 0
 #else
  extern void *xquad_portio;    /* Where the IO area was mapped */
 #endif
#endif /* CONFIG_MULTIQUAD */
Or something along these lines ... ? Would make the changeset
somewhat smaller. Seems to work from 30 seconds thought, but 
haven't tried it (yet).
