Yep, but that interface needs a BAR.
The "0xc0000" usage here for the VGA rom stuff, and some of the quirk
examples, want something a little bit different.
I suppose we could create something that cooked up a fake PCI
device and a BAR, but that is a bit too much for what we're
trying to do here I'm afraid.
