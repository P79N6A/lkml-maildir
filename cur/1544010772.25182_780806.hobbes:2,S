I pushed it to my -next branch, though I forgot to add the stable@ cc and fix 
up the comments while I was there... I think I'll have to rebase anyway, so 
I'll take care of both of those when I do.

    resource:  revert parent nesting of identical ranges
    Revert the change that causes inverted resource nesting in the case of
    identical resource ranges.  Initially introduced by
    d33b6fba2c4350651f3f61ff2ab858a2f116e9a4, this change was provided
    without a justification and seems to cause problems on some machines in
    the face of PCI hot plugging.
    The patch makes resources registered against an existing but identical
    range nest as children of the existing resource, rather than parents.
