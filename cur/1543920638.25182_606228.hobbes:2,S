Well there actually is no reason to copy the current data into the
zero page.  We really should just leave it where it is until the
kernel has managed to bootstrap it's basic services.
As for the setup data can we please remove the pointers. And just
require the that the data items be appended one after each other
in memory.  Then we would just need a field where we could
report an offset to the binary data from where we loaded the
16bit code/data.  We could even specify the end by requiring
that we fill in setup_move_size or something of that nature.
Beyond that we should provide the bootloaders enough information to
know which information the kernel will overwrite before it consults
the e820 map and other indicators of what memory is free.
