I better correct my statement.  Just had a look at the old Perl script
in question.
I was originally using 'use Cwd; getcwd()'.  That was really slow and it
does exactly what Alex says.  Even though you don't need to call stat()
on each entry: the readdir system call returns the inode numbers for all
directories that aren't mount points, but Perl doesn't give that
information to its libraries (for the sake of portability).
Then I switched to 'use POSIX; getcwd()'.  That was faster, but still
distressingly slow (i.e. noticable in human terms).  POSIX::getcwd()
forks and execs to call /bin/pwd, and is quite fast.  But 'use POSIX' is
quite slow.  Shame really, because the implementation is in a shared
library; it's just the 'use POSIX' importing part that's slow.
Then I tried `/bin/pwd' myself since the POSIX function uses it.  That
was pretty fast and I was impressed with Linux for being that fast.  Of
course it is still 1.7 million cycles which is not brilliant, but it was
faster than I'd expected for a pipe/fork/exec.
Finally I just did the getcwd() system call myself.  Used a hard-coded
system call number, because reading it from a header file was slow.
Linus was right about startup times in this case.
enjoy,
