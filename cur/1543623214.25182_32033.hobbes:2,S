unshared isn't the very common case (shm, and file mappings like
executables are all going to be shared, not unshared).
So unless you first share all the pagetables as well (like Ben once said
years ago), it's not going to be a direct pointer in the very common
case. And there's no guarantee you can share the pagetable (even
assuming the kernels supports that at the maximum possible degree across
execve and at random mmaps too) if you map those pages at different
virtual addresses.
