What happens is that the superblock is altered in-memory
to say "the filesystem needs checking", but it's not written
out to disk.
So other things can come in, alter the fs, get written out *before*
the superblock and then you crash.  fsck won't be run, and the
filesystem is left in an inconsistent state.
This actually happens.  On a stock RH7.1 setup, you can
hit reset as soon as you get the first login prompt.  fsck
will not be run on reboot.  If you run it by hand, fsck
finds errors.
Andreas, my one-liner was, umm, hasty.  I think you had
a decent fix for this?
