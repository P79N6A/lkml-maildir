Well isn't it a bad idea to have cpus in the data that are offline?
It'll throw off all your balancing calculations, won't it? You seemed
to be careful to do things like divide the total load on the node by
the number of CPUs on the node, and that'll get totally borked if you
have fake CPUs in there.
To me, it'd make more sense to add the CPUs to the scheduler structures
as they get brought online. I can also imagine machines where you have
a massive (infinite?) variety of possible CPUs that could appear - 
like an NUMA box where you could just plug arbitrary numbers of new
nodes in as you wanted.
Moreover, as the CPUs aren't fixed numbers in advance, how are you going 
to know which node to put them in, etc? Setting up every possible thing 
in advance seems like an infeasible way to do hotplug to me.
