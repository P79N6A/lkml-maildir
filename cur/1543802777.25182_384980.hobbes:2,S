When I tried to build a 2.6.15-mm2 kernel with NR_CPUS 1024, and turned
on some of the LOCK DEBUG options:
    1160c1160
    < # CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is not set
    ---
    > CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
    1163,1164c1163,1164
    < # CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK is not set
    < # CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP is not set
    ---
    > CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
    > CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
then the build failed:
      LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
    arch/ia64/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x68b2): In function `topology_init':
    arch/ia64/kernel/ivt.S:1465: undefined reference to `__you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much'
    make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Backing off to 512 CPUs built ok.
There are a couple of kmalloc() calls in topology_init().  I didn't try
to figure out which one blew up, nor did I try to investigate further.
