 Dear list,
Anyone could help me with JS20 board?
I am working on an application which should work in HyperVisor mode
(I have a custom openfirmware which allows my application to work in HyperVisor mode).
Thus my application has to work with hardware directly, without using openfirmware.
Howerver I faced a problem when working on this application:
I can't reset a board.
I tried to reset a board via System Reset Register CF9 of AMD-8111 HT IO Hub, but the board hangs.
I think its possible to reset a board using watchdog timer, anyone tried to use this approacth?
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Petr Krasinovsky
