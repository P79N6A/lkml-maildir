Subject: [0/5] PCI MMConfig per-chipset support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/7/128

Done in 5 steps, at Andi's very reasonable request:
1/5: PCI MMConfig: Share what's shareable.
  Share code between i386 and x86-64
2/5: PCI MMConfig: Only call unreachable_devices() when type 1 is available.
  Trivial fix.
3/5: PCI MMConfig: Only map what's necessary.
  Trivial fix too.
4/5: PCI MMConfig: Detect and support the E7520 and the 945G/GZ/P/PL
  The actual per-chipset support.
5/5: PCI MMConfig: Reserve resources but only when we're sure about them.
  Add the resources in /proc/iomem when the chipset in known.
  OG.
