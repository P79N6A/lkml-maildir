I would ask someone from znxz.
I downloaded their driver, and there are at least a few comments about
2.3 compatibility
(and I also found a 5000 line hardware abstraction layer, and only 9 out
of the 15 kernel files are GPL, the rest is "All rights reserved".
Obiously their Makefile allows to compile the driver statically into the
kernel.)
