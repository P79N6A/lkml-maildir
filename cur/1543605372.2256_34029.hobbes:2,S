What was it?  A process stuck in D state?  Something like dist.net or seti?
Reminds me of recently when my X server (a couple days ago from
debian-unstable) cought a memory leak, and my system was swapping like
crazy.  I thought it was something to do with the shmem problem I found a
while back, but I looked at /proc/meminfo and no errors with shmem.  Finally
I checked top...
Unfortunately, the OOM killer killed a few things, all except for my X
server that was causing the problem.
