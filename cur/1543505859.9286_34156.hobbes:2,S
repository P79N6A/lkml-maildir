OK, 'noatime' does the trick. Many Thanks. It doesn't help, of course,
if I edit/compile/run the same program over and over again. Even when
I turn of 'auto-save' in emacs, it still does something from time to
time (while typing).

Sure. But many people won't be able to do that, and 'mobile-update'
makes it much easier IMHO. In that case, you would only care for fsync's
(basically syslog). You can have 'noatime' if you need it for
some reason, and you won't care about frequent but tiny cron jobs like
'rmmod -a' at all. Actually, with my patch it's pretty much like working 
on a ramdisk.

I have an IBM (DADA 26480) drive, which claims to use: 1W in 'active
idle' and only 0.1 W in 'sleep' mode. My laptop needs on average 14W.
I I figured out that this would give only 6% more battery live (10
minutes), or 12% when compared to 'performance idle' mode (20
minutes). Not a big deal and with bigger screens even less, I agree.
Cheers, Peter
