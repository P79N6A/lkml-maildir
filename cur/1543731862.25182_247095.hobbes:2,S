I think Greg "chose" to take it out.

I do not believe he "had no choice".  The guards at Auswitchs made the
same argument at Nuremberg.  The tribunal determined they did have a
choice.  I doubt we can consider the conditions here more extreme
then there.

The kernel cannot act itself.  It is more or less an inanimate
object.  People must carry out actions on its behalf.

This confuses me.  The functionability people are after is the closed
source part. Maintaining the open source portion seems unrelated.

I disagree.  Binary drivers may take away from Linux and they may add to it.

I think from statements Greg made above we can at least say he is
willing to hide behind misplaced authority.
