Well, it pretty much describes why *I* am running Linux.

Well, I didn't consider Linux really usable before about that time. And  
neither BSD.
I think I had already given up on Minix (after hearing Tanenbaum refuse to  
add message queues so we could get rid of several *really* hairy corners,  
with potential deadlocks and violating module boundaries and stuff - our  
views on simplicity were *really* incompatible), and was hoping for BSD to  
"grow up". Except there was the law suit, and Linux grew up faster.
And I was pondering writing my own, but I didn't. I think I did have some  
rudimentary switch-to-protected-mode-and-print-some-characters code ...  
;-)

Partly because the M$ problem is getting more acute these days. Except for  
DOS 4, not even M$ manages to completely fsck up a piece of software that  
small (though when I think of the stack of install disks for DOS 6 -  
*shudder*), but when NT 5 is about the size of MVS (heretofore one of the  
most bloated systems around), and has the typical quality of M$ software  
... I guess some people feel strangled. Sometimes I do, too.
