First, please always CC net driver patches to me and netdev@oss.sgi.com.
Second, this patch is incorrect.  Read the top of include/linux/skbuff.h 
for the various levels of checksum offloading, and how to use them.
Specifically,
a) you should not be using CHECKSUM_HW unless your hardware provides a 
valid csum (ipv4 or ipv6) that you store in skb->csum.
b) you should not be using NETIF_F_HW_CSUM for reasons similar to (a): 
your hardware must be able to csum the packet whether its ipv4 or ipv6 
or whatever, given the information in the skb.
c) use of NETIF_F_xxx_CSUM is pointless without NETIF_F_SG and code in 
the transmit path to handle page-based fragments (a scatter-gather list).
