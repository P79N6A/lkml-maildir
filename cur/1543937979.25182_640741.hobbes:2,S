Mike,
 I have always been happy with the AACRAID box compared to the CCISS system. Even with the "regression" in 2.6.24-rc1..rc5 it was more than acceptable to me. For me the differences between 2.6.19  and 2.6.24-rc8 on the AACRAID setup are:
- 11% (single stream) to 25% (dual/triple stream) regression in DIO. Something I do not care much about. I just measure it for reference.
+ the very nice behaviour when writing to different targets (mix3), which I attribute to Peter's per-dbi stuff.
 And until -rc6 I was extremely pleased with the cool speedup I saw on my CCISS boxes. This would have been the next "production" kernel for me. But lets discuss this under a seperate topic. It has nothing to do with the original wait-io issue.
 Oh, before I forget. There has been no tuning for the AACRAID. The system is an IBM x3650 with built in AACRAID and battery backed write cache. The disks are 6x142GB/15krpm in a RAID5 setup. I see one big difference between your an my tests. I do 1MB writes to simulate the behaviour of the real applications, while yours seem to be much smaller.
 
Cheers
Martin
