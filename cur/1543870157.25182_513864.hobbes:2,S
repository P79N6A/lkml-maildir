"Not the best place for it" is the understatement of the year.
It's totally idiotic.

*NO*.
Dammit, we don't put static initializers in header files. We don't 
duplicate the data in every single thing that includes a header file. If 
you want to duplicate the data, you export it as a real data structure, 
and you *still* put the data structure in a .c file.

WHAT CLEANUP? The thing is the anti-thesis of a "cleanup". There is no 
excuse for putting a large array in a header file and including it 
millions of times. Or even just twice. The point of a header file is to 
*declare* things, not to have big data structures in.
