if I remember corretly with C99 if you do s.th. like this (simple
sample):
#define LOG(level, format, ...)					\
                log(level, format, ##__VA_ARGS__);
you _need_ to give an argument:
	LOG(debug, "blah", 0);
w/o the ", 0" this is an error.
There have been gcc extentions that allow(ed) zero arguments.
*searching*
