Subject: [PATCH 0/5] PowerPC: ibmebus refactoring and fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patchset will merge the ibmebus and of_platform bus drivers by basing a
lot of ibmebus functionality on of_platform code and adding the features
specific to ibmebus on top of that.
I split the actual ibmebus rework into three patches (2/5-4/5) for easier
readability. The kernel will compile during the intermediate states, and
ibmebus will not crash, but not work either.
As a side-effect of patch 3/5, a problem with bus_id collisions in case of
two devices sharing the same location code is resolved -- the bus_id is now
determined differently.
[1/5] moves of_device allocation into of_device.[ch]
[2/5] removes the old bus match/probe/remove functions
[3/5] adds device creation and bus probing based on of_device
[4/5] finally moves to of_device and of_platform_driver by changing
      ibmebus.h and matching the eHCA and eHEA drivers
[5/5] just changes a nit in ibmebus_store_probe()
These patches should apply cleanly, in order, against 2.6.23-rc5 and against
Linus' git. Please review and comment them, and queue them up for 2.6.24 if
you think they're okay.
Thanks and regards,
  Joachim
