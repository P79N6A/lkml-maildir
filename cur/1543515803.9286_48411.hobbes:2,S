I don't want that too, but there is still room for improvement. IMO it's
possible to integrate the realtime part better into Linux, so it's
possible to use more Linux services directly from RTLinux and the
hardrealtime part could be a normal Linux driver. I don't think this has
to be slower, but the important part would be to make the user space
realtime part more responsive, there of course would be a small price, but
that could be disabled by a config option.
bye, Roman
