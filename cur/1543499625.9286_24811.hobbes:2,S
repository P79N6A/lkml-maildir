Actually, I just tried 2.3.7-9 and the same corruption exists. It seems to
only occur when lots of files are accessed (usually it's on the lines of
rm -Rf /linux ; bunzip -c linux-2.3.6.tar.bz2 | tar xvfp -). Running pine
at the same time, for example, changed some of the lines in one message to
more null characters. Under normal circumstances, it seems to do fine.
On a side note, the mirroring system could be a bit better. I only found
two sites that had 2.3.7-9.

Technical support personnel recommend that I do it regularly- kind of like  
brushing my teeth. To help remind me of this necessity, windows pop up to 
tell me to reboot whenever I make a configuration change. By now my 
machine is minty fresh, I figure."
