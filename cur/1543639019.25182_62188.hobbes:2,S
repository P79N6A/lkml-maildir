But that overhead did not show up in the kernel build timings you posted, 
which do a realistic amount of forking.  So what is the worry, exactly?

Your vector will only be half full on average.

The algorithm I showed is pretty simple.  Active defragmentation is just
something we should be doing, where we can.  Fragmentation does happen,
and there are too many places where we're just trying to pretend that it
doesn't, or fiddling with allocation policy in the hopes it will magically
go away, which it never does.

That's what I was thinking, then we just have to figure out how to find
all those swapped-out ptes efficiently.

Yes, nice.
