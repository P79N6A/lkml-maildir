True; thats why I only started submitting these now we are feature
chilled. I reckoned it was important not to get into the misconception
we didn't have many bugs left because things were starting to chug along
nicely on x86.

True; but sometimes people have desires to run the same/similar kernel
versions on all their systems and/or use some patches without having to
have versions for all systems.

Indeed - (Alpha is actually one of the few non-x86 architectures
that actually built fully for me in a recent 2.5.x - and made a passable
attempt at booting)
