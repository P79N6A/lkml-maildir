It is more critical now if one wants to use eg. UMSDOS filesystem as root fs.
As the msdos filesystem is linked first system always tries to use it first
when there is a FAT filesystem on the root device.
One way of solving the problem is the "rootfs" parameter.
Changing link sequence to be non-alphabetic is another choice...
However, it is a separate issue that UMSDOS-root is broken in 2.4 at the
moment. But I hope it is not a permanent state.
