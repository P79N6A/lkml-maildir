Good point.  The technique that looks for the first nonzombie in the group
to fetch its fs might be best if it's necessary to use fs for the
permission checks.  It should always find a winner on just one
iteration, or two or three in races, except for ptrace keeping zombie
threads alive (otherwise all zombies but the leader self-reap quickly).
Thanks,
Roland
