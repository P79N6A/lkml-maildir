It 'should' be the case because that is what is easiest for users and
makes most sense from a user's point of view.
You still haven't given any reason why a user should have to know or
care whether the built-in serial ports on his/her computer are
implemented with a 16C550 chip or a Z85C30 chip or something else.
Now, *maybe* the naming can be fixed up with udev.  I haven't invested
the week of my life that it would take to investigate the twisty maze
of shell scripts that udev seems to involve.
In any case your patch is a user-visible incompatible API change and
will break existing working setups, so it should only be put in after
suitable warning has been given.  Maybe we need a module parameter to
select between the old and new behaviour to ease the transition.
Paul.
