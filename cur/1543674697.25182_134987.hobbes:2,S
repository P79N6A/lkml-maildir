Hi,
Here are some more USB fixes for the latest 2.5.69.  They include some
merge fixups that I caused in the last set of patches sent to you, and a
interrupt latency fix some people have been reporting, and a fix for
some devices that also has been reported on lkml.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/linus-2.5
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
