this method states that the method of access is unsupported and 
unintentional.  Which is why i didn't think that it was the right way to 
use cdrecord on atapi devices without ide-scsi.

If you make what is a general question too specific with details you 
limit your responses if anyone thinks their response is correct for you 
anyway.  I limited my question as much as i wanted to, with the desired 
effect no less.
apparently cdrecord's documention is a little behind it's code. Now 
tracking down why it seems to be botching audio cds for me would require 
a full bugreport style mail now that i know cdrecord is being used in 
the correct manner.
