Slightly off topic (and a bit newbie too, but hey...). When I was
rewriting the bttv driver for v4l2, I used the v4l2 memory management,
which uses nopage() to increase page->count, and the return page (the
memory is vmalloc()ed.  This worked, but there was occasional memory
corruption, as though the physical memory was being moved.  Switching to
the old style bttv memory management (basically the same as the sound
drivers) fixed this problem.  Is there any extra "catch" to using the
nopage method, or did I just make a stupid mistake somewhere.  (If
anybody actually wants to look at the code, you can get it from
http://bttv-v4l2.sourceforge.net/download/driver091000.tgz
 - both
methods are there delimmited by #if(n)def BTTV_MM lines.  When BTTV_MM
is defined, it works fine, otherwise I get occasional memory
corruption.)
If anybody could give a comment on why one works, and the other not, I
would appreciate it!
