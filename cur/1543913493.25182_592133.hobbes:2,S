Well, this patch is defenitely not for 2.6.23 or stable kernel.
It's for 2.6.24.

I occasionally do but sometimes forget.  The problem is often that I
want first the merge to Linus tree, and then I forget to submit to
stable tree when the merge takes long time in the end.  (Ther merge of
alsa.git is too spotty, and that's another big problem for me.  In
short, I do NOT maintain alsa.git tree at all...)
Another problem I see is that we have little chance for testing the
target patches with stable kernels.  Even it looks OK and works for
the later kernels, it often doesn't work or break magically with the
older kernels.  Usually, I have no affected hardware, and bug
reporters test only with the recent version (partly because developers
ask first to try the latest version -- if it works, why to downgrade
again?) 
thanks,
Takashi
