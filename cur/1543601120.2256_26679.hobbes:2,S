I'm desperately looking for some recent documentation on quotas.
We've recently upgraded our two Debian potato fileservers to 2.4 and
2.4-ac (currently they're both running 2.4-ac so I can't check 2.4 atm)
and quotas have stopped working.
The quota package is 3.00pre01-7.bunk, and quotaon calls quotactl which
returns -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory), as it's looking for
aquota.user, evidently a "version 2 quota" (according to the edquota
manpage), and not falling back to the quota.user files which do exist.
So now we're essentially running without quota support :-(
On another computer (Debian woody) I've made an ext3 partition, touched
aquota.user and quotactl now returns -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument).
Please can anyone help? Should I switch to XFS and go back to a
2.4.5-based kernel?
Matt
