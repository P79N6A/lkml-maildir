From the same manpage:
"The raw1394 module must be loaded and its device node
 be writable (this normally requires root)" 
Ok it doesn't say you need ohci1394 too and doesn't say that's the target.
If I do a new revision I'll perhaps expand the docs a bit.
So load ohci1394/raw1394 and run firescope as root. Your distribution
will hopefully take care of the device nodes. Usually you want 
something like firescope -Au System.map
