   And for a good reason too. So don't kill the user's programs. That's why
Jesse and others would really like per user memory quotas, just as you have
per user disk space quotas. If you can disable overcommit, the program is
in control of what happens when it can't get the amount of memory it would
like. If you also add per user memory quotas, the system administrator can
prevent a single user (or another finite number of users) from using all
memory.
