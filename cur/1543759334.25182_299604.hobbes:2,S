As it happens I was editing that exact page in the wiki t'other day:
  
http://openembedded.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/GettingStarted
I actually only wanted a toolchain but oe and scratchbox[1] seemed the 
rational alternatives.
Scratchbox seems to offer : arm-gcc-3.3.4-glibc-2.3.2 but I've not 
gotten round to using it yet.
Thanks for the comment on "bitbake binutils-cross-sdk" and "bitbake 
gcc-cross-sdk".
I'll add more notes to the page once I figure it all out.
