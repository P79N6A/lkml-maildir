Subject: 2.3.38 -- Compile error (file /drivers/usb/usb.a missing)
I am getting a compile error when having attempting to compile fernel 2.3.38
with USB and sound.  The file /drivers/usb/usb.a cannot be found. I have a
set of
Microsoft USB speakers and am testing how they work with the new kernel.  Is
there a patch to get this file?
This is the error --
ld: cannot open drivers/usb/usb.a: No such file or directory
Thanks
Chris Woodruff
