You're right that the default is now to freeze threads. This is mostly because 
the majority of kernel threads can and should be frozen because they're not 
needed. If a thread is frozen which shouldn't be, the user (which will 
hopefully be the developer testing their work) will experience a deadlock 
when they try to suspend. If, on the other hand, we let threads run that 
should be frozen, well - the outcome depends on what is done when the thread 
should be frozen. Obviously it doesn't hurt too much to let kernel threads 
run, or we'd see problems at the moment. For this reason, I consider this 
patch more to be a nicety than a necessity. Nice because it makes kernel 
threads behave in a manner consistent with what happens to userspace (hence 
defaulting to freezing, rather than not).
Regards,
Nigel
