I can only find two `struct irq_chip's in arch/ia64 and they both have a
.mask.  And a .unmask.  So perhaps that is a misreading of what oopsed.
There are no changes in kernel/irq/ in -mm.  Are you sure mainline doesn't
do this too?
Anyway, can you please take a closer look at exactly what pointer it is
oopsing on?
