It's why i say i make the diff before altering function callings as i
did for other stuff...
if you really want it, i can resend the whole patch with fixed functions
points (but not before monday as i leave my university for the week-end)
Flaming people before reading the whole message isn't very productive,
particularly for a forgoten diff that can easily be fixed.
anyway, i won't argue more with you as you've a better experience than
me in kernel programming.

sometimes it is. depending of version and optimizing level, gcc generate
lot of stupid opcodes (ia32 is particularly bugged) that slowly
disapear. i've seen multiple load of a value in registers, mulitple
reload of a non volatile register, pop and posh/moveq)of the same
register without any opcode between, inlining functions both kept as
function
and inlined, jumps bypassing nops, ...

One friend of mine has encountered the floppy bug when the eide driver
claim to use ressources used by the fdc. so it's not an alpha bug as
someone fixed it.
The guy say me that this bug is a few weeks old.
Have you a clue about it ?
Thanks.
