Subject: AUTO LOGIN BUG
> Dear whoever is in charge of writing fedora core 7,

> The auto login is a wonderful feature. However, there is a HUGE flaw in it 
> at the moment. It won't let me log in a root that way. That is MY 
> decision, not YOUR decision. Please fix it in an update!!! I'm sick of

> that there are situation where people have other people use their computer

> anything other than root, and I suspect everyone who has half a brain is 
> the exact same way. Honestly, have you ever been logged in as someone 
> other than root? You absolutely can do nothing on the machine. For those 
> who make the argument that someone logged in as root might break the 
> machine by doing something they shouldn't, I would say it's already broken 
> without being root. You cannot mount drives, edit anything about how the 
> /etc directory is setup, or do many other things that everyone I know does 
> on a regular basis. IN general, there are times when you are logged in as 
> a non-root user when it will ask you for a password. That is so 
> inconvenient when you are the only one who uses your own computer. PLEASE 
> get root auto login as an option. No one but me has to set it up this way, 
> but please give ME the option.
