you're experiencing the wonder of the L1 data cache on the P4 ... based on 
its behaviour i'm pretty sure that early in the pipeline they use the 
virtual address to match a virtual tag and procede with that data as if 
it's correct.  not until the TLB lookup and physical tag check many cycles 
later does it realise that it's done something wrong and pull kill / flush 
pipelines.
when you set up a virtual alias, like you have with the shared zero page, 
it becomes very confused.
in fact if you do something as simple as a 4 element pointer-chase where 
the cache lines for elt 0 and 2 alias, and cache lines for 1 and 3 alias 
then you can watch some p4 take up to 3000 cycles per reference.
