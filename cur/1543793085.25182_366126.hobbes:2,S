Indeed. Thanks.
And we could also mark text section read-only and data/stack section
noexec if NX is supported. But I doubt the whole thing would really
help much. Kill the kernel thread? We can't. We only run into a panic.
Anyway I'd attach a quick patch to mark text section read only in the
next mail.
If it's ok, I'd add Kconfig support. Comments?
