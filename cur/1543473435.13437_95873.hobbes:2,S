Suggestions:
1) Linux Device Drivers by Alessandro Rubini (this is very good!)
2) Linux Kernel Book by Remy Card, Eric Dumas, Franck Mevel
3) The Linux Kernel found at various LDP mirrors.
4) Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide also at the LDP mirrors.
5) The Kernel Hackers Guide (dated but much is still relevant).
Lastly, there is NO SUBSTITUTE for many many long nights of tracing
flow via your own printk's inserted into the code.  After a couple
of hundred self induced linux kernel crashes comes the magic moment 
when Voila! things suddenly start to make sense :)
Happy Holidays,
