get_empty_inode is hopefully going to die in the current, non-static version.

Any inode that gets into the icache already has and superblock.
If any other are left they really should use a different allocator.

Rename your current get_empty_inode to __get_empty_inode and mark it
static.  Add a new get_empty_inode that calls __get_empty_inode(NULL) or
