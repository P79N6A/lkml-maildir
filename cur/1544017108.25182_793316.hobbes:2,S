I had lockdep enabled in my config so I ran the tests again with
x86-64 defconfig and I'm back to square one:
  [ number of transactions per second from 10 runs, bigger is better ]
                   min      max      avg      sd
  2.6.29-rc1-slab  802.02   805.37   803.93   0.97
  2.6.29-rc1-slub  807.78   811.20   809.86   1.05
