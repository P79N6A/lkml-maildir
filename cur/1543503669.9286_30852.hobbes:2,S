One value alone is poor. We ought to have:
CLOCKS_HZ     for the one ugly system call
PROC_HZ       for general /proc output
PROCNET_HZ    for /proc/net specifically
TRUE_HZ       what the kernel really uses, even if not periodic

I know this is not true. I wrote the new ps. (prepare for rant)
There is no way to write a parser that will survive all of:
1. new columns
2. new spelling for keywords or row names
3. new rows
4. apparent keyword columns that suddenly get whitespace
Together, problems 1 and 4 are hell.
Together, problems 2 and 3 are hell.
It is better to write a dumb, fast, and simple parser. You will need to
replace your parser no matter what, so it is better to have one that is
easy to replace.
This isn't supposed to be like human-generated code you know, and even
that generally comes with a well-defined syntax. Asking parsers to be
able to tolerate /proc changes is like asking a C compiler from 1980
to support Java. Who could have predicted the changes?
It is best to eliminate the parser, reduce in-kernel formatting code,
and reduce the number of system calls needed. The most reasonable API
would use one system call for each type of information, returning
several related values at once. For example, all of the time stamps
should be returned in one call. All of the UID values should be returned
together in a different call. (all of that 64-bit of course)

What, make the Alpha port use 100 for /proc data?

HZ still has a value. HZ is the smallest interval you can generate or
measure. HZ could be as high as the CPU core frequency.

Feel free to grab the code from proc/sysinfo.c in the procps package.
BTW, glibc also does a bad guess for the number of processors. It tries
to parse /proc/cpuinfo, which is of course different on every architecture.
Sometimes glibc screws up, giving a value of zero. According to the standard,
a value of zero is _not_ an error code. Hey, Linux is the fastest OS on a
system without any processors at all!

AFAIK,
sysctl() is for setting values
sysconf() is for getting values

OK, here is one:
1. add proper sysconf() support
2. make HZ vary by processor config (200 for 486, 400 for 586...)
3. revert to a 100 HZ default for Linux 2.4.xx, then back for 2.5.xx
