An xconfig bug.  Aiee.
Here's a more detailed "how to reproduce" section:
    In linux 2.4.0-test7, i386 architecture, do the following:
	make oldconfig
	make xconfig
    In the xconfig menu, select "General setup".  Scroll down to "Power
    Management Support".  Change "Power Management Support" from "y" to
    "n".
    Watch what happens to the sub-options of "Advanced Power Management
    BIOS support".  They go from greyed-out to live.  This is incorrect.
