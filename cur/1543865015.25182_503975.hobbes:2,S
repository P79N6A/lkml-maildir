As I said, Greg didn't say it was rude to write a new driver without consulting
the author of an existing driver.. corp *or* community.. so who said
it was?  You can rewrite whatever you feel like rewriting.  Greg was
talking about what is polite usage of someone elses code.  In
particular, doing stuff they've specifically said they don't want you
to do with it is rude.
From a practical standpoint it makes sense, I think: the guy who wrote
the code is often the best person to maintain it, so don't piss him
off.  If you want to rewrite it, then you would be the guy offering to
maintain it..
