SimOS features several simulators differing in performance and the degree
of CPU details simulated, so the user can make the optimal choice for his
application.
The SimOS has abandomed the use of Linux/MIPS since way back in time when
they were trying to use it, the MIPS port was still to unfinished.  I
however think that their MIPS CPU simulators are still the most advanced
ones.  They then switched to the Alpha.
Later on using a different simulation software Linux/MIPS has successfully
been used to verify the design of a new member of the MIPS CPU family.
Simulating CPUs at gate level running at speed of ten instructions per
second sucked big chunky rocks ...
