Yes.  Our use of setprocattr is thru a library fn so I just made the change
there.  We'll have to change our user tools (that read /proc/pid/attr/current
but thats fine too).

I assumed it was due to this. Doesn't inconvenience us any and it it helps 
SELinux it's fine w/ me.
Of more concern is ps -Z (pstools).
We had to have the pstools maintainer extend the set of characters that it
considered valid from the getprocattr.    I forget the details but IIRC he 
wanted to know (for ?documentation?) every character that could be returned 
by our getprocattr hook (which for us is pretty much any character thats 
valid in a pathname -- though IIRC we forgot one).
Anyway, I'm guessing (at least with pstools 3.2.5) that '(' is not one of
the valid characters. IIRC ps gives up when it sees a "non-valid" character.
I wrote a trivial little lsm which just returns 'foobar' for any getprocattr.
# cat /proc/2322/attr/current 
unconstrained (subdomain)
foobar (foobar)
# ps -Z -p 2322
LABEL                             PID TTY          TIME CMD
unconstrained                    2322 ttyS0    00:00:00 bash
Even if ps did return them all, I think it could create a usability problem.  
There was another LSM (forget which) which wanted to return a large blob 
from getprocattr, I recall like a page? in size which obviously caused problems
for ps -Z both in terms of content and especially length.

I was just pointing out the legacy comment. Thats all.
Thanks again
