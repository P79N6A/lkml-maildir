Some questions.
1. Your point is rignt in some ways, and I agree with you.
   Yes, I currently guess Jail is quite practical than Xen.
   Xen sounds cool, but really practical? I doubt a bit.
   But it would be a narrow thought, maybe.
   How you estimate feature improvement of memory shareing
   on VM ( e.g. Xen/VMware)?
   I have seen there are many papers about this issue.
   If once memory sharing gets much efficient, Xen possibly wins.
2. Folks, how you think about other good points of Xen,
   like live migration, or runs solaris, or has suspend/resume or...
   No Linux jails have such feature for now, although I dont think
   it is impossible with jail.
My current suggestion is,
1. Dont use Xen for running multiple VMs.
2. Use Xen for better admin/operation/deploy... tools.
3. If you need multiple VMs, use jail on Xen.
