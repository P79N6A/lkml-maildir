Thanks for the support. I do the best I can because just like you I believe that it's
a perfectly valid workload and there a lot of interesting applications that will benefit
from mainline support.

You have to bring it offline first.
In other words:
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/isolated
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Sorry my bad. I had a typo in the patch description the option is "isolcpus=N".
We've had that option for awhile now. I mean it's not even part of my patch.
Thanx
