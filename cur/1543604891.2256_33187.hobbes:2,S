Yes, some BIOSes have "S.M.A.R.T." and some "SMART".
Thanks for the history lesson and research...
Cyrus, replace that drive, or at least test it with badblocks.  One thing
that I've noticed about badblocks is that there are times when part of a
drive is about to go bad, but doesn't give an error message.  It just takes
longer, and uses several reads but finally completes successfully.  The
only time I've noticed this was on
a drive where badblocks *did* find an error, but there were parts that took
much too long to read, and probably should've been marked faulty.  (This was
with badblocks in e2fsprogs 1.18).  Though, taking a long time to read could
be caused by other users on a multi-user system, but if there is a way to
detect if a drive is retrying to read, that would be a good way to check...
BTW Cyrus, your mail bounced, so if you take the time to read the archive,
you'll know...
