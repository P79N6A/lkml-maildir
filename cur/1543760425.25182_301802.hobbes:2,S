There are only two recent revisions to 8250.c.  One adds slightly buggy
Xscale UART detection, the other fixes the buggyness.
What I don't know is whether either of these two changes are the cause
of your exact problems, because I don't actually know what you're
testing.  Since Stephen's bug is a lot more well defined than yours,
it makes sense to tackle Stephen's situation first.
The reason for this is taht pppd getting a SIGHUP doesn't actually tell
me anything at all.
