I was looking at the arch-specific make options for various archs,
and found this bit of fun:
:; make help ARCH=sh
[elided]
Architecture specific targets (sh):
  zImage                  - Compressed kernel image (arch/sh/boot/zImage)
  SCCS            - Build for arch/sh/configs/SCCS
  defconfig-adx           - Build for adx
  defconfig-cqreek        - Build for cqreek
  defconfig-dreamcast     - Build for dreamcast
  defconfig-hp680         - Build for hp680
  defconfig-se7751        - Build for se7751
  defconfig-snapgear      - Build for snapgear
  defconfig-systemh       - Build for systemh
[elided]
The defconfig options only show up after a bk get in arch/sh/configs/.
There are also several archs that do not have any arch-specific
help.  ppc64 (unlike ppc) is one such example.
