 It would, but this would require quite a serious driver rewrite --
buffers would only be allocated when a frame arrives and not when the
board is initialized (no idea why it is handled differently now, maybe an
OSF/1 legacy...).  I might see if I can do it but not at the moment -- I
have definitely too many other tasks pending. 
 An alternate short-term solution could be just to return -ENOMEM and let
the caller of init_module() handle it.  But this way there may never be
much enough real memory available.

 It does help.  Note the code is allocating ~1.2MB in one run and there is
plenty of virtual memory available (but not real one).
