Ugh, there is.
I just thought about this case:
We find a dead swap cache page, so dead_swap_page goes to 1.
We call swap_writepage(), but in the meantime the swapin readahead code   
got a reference on the swap map for the page.
We write the page out because "(swap_count(page) > 1)", and we may
not have __GFP_IO set in the gfp_mask. Boom.
