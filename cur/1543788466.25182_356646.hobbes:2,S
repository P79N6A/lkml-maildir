You beat me by a couple of minutes.  I was about to say that the culprit
is in the qla2x00 driver where it unnecessarily activated generic blk
tag queuing by calling scsi_activate_tcq() and it never uses tag.

It starts out with scsi_end_request being a fairly hot function in the
execution profile, then I noticed blk_queue_start/end_tag() are being
called but no actual consumer of using the tag.  I'm trying to find a
way to avoid making these blk_queue_start/end_tag calls.  I got the
answer
now. The proper way is to fix it in the scsi LLDD.  Scratch this patch,
new patch to follow :-)
