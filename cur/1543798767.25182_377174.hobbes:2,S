There's no filtering between the two.  I get this on the machine itself:
$ rpcinfo -u localhost 100021
rpcinfo: RPC: Timed out
program 100021 version 0 is not available
zsh: exit 1     rpcinfo -u localhost 100021
There's no lockd process running on this client machine anymore.
On the server:
$ rpcinfo -u localhost 100021               
program 100021 version 1 ready and waiting
rpcinfo: RPC: Program/version mismatch; low version = 1, high version =4
program 100021 version 2 is not available
program 100021 version 3 ready and waiting
program 100021 version 4 ready and waiting
zsh: exit 1     rpcinfo -u localhost 100021
Also neither machine is anywhere close to OOM.
