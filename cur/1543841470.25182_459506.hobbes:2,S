How about just using synchronize_rcu() in the second situation?
This primitive blocks until the grace period completes, allowing you to
do the remaining processing in thread context.  As a bonus, RCU code
that uses synchronize_rcu() is usually quite a bit simpler than code
using call_rcu().
Using synchronize_rcu():
	list_del_rcu(p);
	synchronize_rcu();
	kfree(p);
Using call_rcu():
	static void rcu_callback_func(struct rcu_head *rcu)
	{
		struct foo *p = container_of(rcu, struct foo, rcu);
		kfree(p);
	}
	list_del_rcu(p);
	call_rcu(&p->rcu, rcu_callback_func);
Furthermore, the call_rcu() approach requires a struct rcu_head somewhere
in the data structure, so use of synchronize_rcu() saves a bit of memory,
as well.
But if you have a situation where neither synchronize_srcu() nor
call_rcu() is working out for you, let's hear it!
						Thanx, Paul
