I have a question regarding a busy box I recently updated to
'2.4.2-ac20'. It has been running for several hours without any real
problems until I started getting 'dmesg' entries like:
Out of Memory: Killed process 30293 (httpd).
Out of Memory: Killed process 32552 (mysqld).
Not a quick check with 'top' shows:
Mem:   771440K av,  396060K used,  375380K free,       0K shrd,    4972K
buff
Swap:  379416K av,  345000K used,   34416K free                  337128K
cached
I have also attached my "/proc/meminfo" & "/proc/slabinfo" details.
Basically they all show the server has 370MB of free physical memory but
its using lots of swap space and OOM is killing processes.
What gives?
Vince.
