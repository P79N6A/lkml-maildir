Hi Sebastian,
Yes I had put this in the background for awhile due to other issues.
I fixed up a few merge conflicts so that it will apply against the
current tree; however, the patch causes these new warnings:
include/asm/xor_32.h:513: warning: 'xor_block_pII_mmx' defined but not used
include/asm/xor_32.h:521: warning: 'xor_block_p5_mmx' defined but not used
include/asm/xor_32.h:853: warning: 'xor_block_pIII_sse' defined but not used
include/asm-generic/xor.h:680: warning: 'xor_block_8regs' defined but not used
include/asm-generic/xor.h:688: warning: 'xor_block_32regs' defined but not used
include/asm-generic/xor.h:696: warning: 'xor_block_8regs_p' defined but not used
include/asm-generic/xor.h:704: warning: 'xor_block_32regs_p' defined
but not used
It is not immediately clear why?
