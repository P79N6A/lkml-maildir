Ummm, that should read "Having new optimizations break a correct exeucting
program...".  For example, the following program:
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main(){
	  int i;
	  printf ("i = %d\n", i);
	  return 0;
	}
will necessarily print different values for i, depending on the optimization
level, what was on the stack and in the registers when main started, and
possibly other criteria.  Just because a program is executing, it doesn't mean
it is correct.
Both the kernel and the compiler are large complex pieces of software, and
almost certainly have bugs in them, and over the years, I have certainly found
some of these bugs as I use new versions of each.
