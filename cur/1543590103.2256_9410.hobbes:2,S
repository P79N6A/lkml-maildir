I have been using the Breezecom wireless PCCard lan driver for quite
some time with Linux 2.2.x. Now with the latest 2.4 kernels I get errors
that tell me that this driver needs some porting to make it work under
2.4:
BrzWlan.h:300: field `stats' has incomplete type
Env.c: In function `EnvIndicateSendComplete':
Env.c:1160: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
Env.c:1161: `NET_BH' undeclared (first use in this function)
Env.c:1161: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
Env.c:1161: for each function it appears in.)
Env.c: In function `EnvIndicateReceive':
Env.c:1277: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
Env.c:1297: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type
Env.c:1299: warning: passing arg 2 of `eth_type_trans_Rb9f0e9da' from
incompatible pointer type
Env.c: In function `EnvIndicateAppReqComplete':
Env.c:1413: warning: passing arg 1 of `__wake_up_R2c77a2af' from
incompatible pointer type
make: *** [Env.o] Error 1
Did anyone already work on this? The Breezecom web site still has the
1.0 version of the driver, no updates yet.
