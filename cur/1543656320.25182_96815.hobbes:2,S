It's fatal for certain x86 northbridges, that's why the code was
removed 2 years ago.
Maybe it would be ok with this modification:
	pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
	/* Don't touch northbridges or devices with devfn 0:0 */
	if ((dev->class >> 8) != PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST && dev->devfn)
		pci_write_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND,
			cmd & ~(PCI_COMMAND_IO | PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY));
