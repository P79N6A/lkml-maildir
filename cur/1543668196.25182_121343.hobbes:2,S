Beside application triggered driver functions (open, close, read,
write ...) you can (only) use kernel threads.
You can use "pure" kernel threads, workqueues or especially the
kevent-daemon (2.4.x) or the event-workqueue (2.5.x).
If you only need to call something like a short function, use
the work queue. Need more info?
