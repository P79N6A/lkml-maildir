Hi there.

Those totals don't make sense - x/255/63 is ~8 Mbytes per CYLINDER, so
that should be showing somewhere around 8 GIGAbytes, not 8 Mbytes...
 > Why this behaviour? Is it the bios?
That I can't answer, sorry...
One thing though: If you swap them over, do the detected geometries
swap over as well? If so, that would indicate that they're not as
identical as you might otherwise assume...
Best wishes from Riley.
