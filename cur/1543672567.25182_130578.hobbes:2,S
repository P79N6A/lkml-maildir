The target kernel doesn't actually *have* to be closed.  What if the
kernel running the Linux driver was some open-but-incompatible licence?
I'll just pause to point out that the single most successful TCP stack
has to be the BSD one - which started off as DARPA-funded research, and got
lots of feedback in spite of its license.
