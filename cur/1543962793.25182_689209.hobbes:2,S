I can't read the whole patch deeply now but this new concept "rlimit-controlle
r" seems make sense to me.
At quick glance, I have some thoughts.
1. kerner/rlimit_cgroup.c is better for future expansion.
2. why 
   "+This controller framework is designed to be extensible to control any
   "+resource limit (memory related) with little effort."
   memory only ? Ok, all you want to do is related to memory, but someone
   may want to limit RLIMIT_CPU by group or RLIMIT_CORE by group or....
   (I have no plan but they seems useful.;)
   So, could you add design hint of rlimit contoller to the documentation ?
   
3. Rleated to 2. Showing what kind of "rlimit" params are supported by
   cgroup will be good.
I don't think you have to implement all things at once. Staring from
"only RLIMIT_AS is supported now" is good. Someone will expand it if
he needs. But showing basic view of "gerenal purpose rlimit contoller" in _doc
ument_ or _comments_ or _codes_ is a good thing to do.
If you don't want to provide RLIMIT feature other than address space,
it's better to avoid using the name of RLIMIT. It's confusing.
