Unfortunately, the hardware doesn't seem to give us that option. There's 
no obvious way of determining whether we're on AC or DC from the kernel 
without doing very nasty things with ACPI and APM (userspace can work it 
out fairly easily).
Would you be open to adding generic support for displaying separate AC 
and DC brightnesses? Making it driver specific leaves the potential for
inconsistencies.
