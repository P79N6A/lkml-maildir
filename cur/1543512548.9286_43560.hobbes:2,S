    I'd like to know this as well.  This could be a better solution than
just letting the cwd disappear.  I would think the kernel could change a
process' cwd but I'm not sure about this.  Using a signal might also be a
solution but then the program would have to be programmed with that in mind.
By the way the other thing I need to be able to do is say mount a cdrom on
/cdrom even if some process happens to have its cwd in /cdrom.
