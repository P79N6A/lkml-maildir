Not in Linus' kernel, it doesn't.
If you're working off the OMAP tree, bear in mind that I've found in
the past that they have a large number of wrong or inappropriate
changes to the MMC layer in there.  They don't regularly merge either,
and they certainly don't forward any bug fixes for review in a timely
manner.
mmc_rescan() is the only caller of mmc_check_cards(), and this only
happens if mmc_rescan() is called with the power already applied
(iow, cards are already known to the MMC layer.)
This call is done _before_ we call mmc_setup() to discover new cards.
Calling mmc_check_cards() from mmc_rescan() is _wrong_, and from what
I can ascertain, it's probably due to unforwarded broken changes in
the OMAP tree.
