The only thing this function needs from fat filesystem is i_realsize. What
about to replace i_realsize with i_size (I guess they have identical
values at the beginning) and move it to /fs/buffer.c to let other
filesystems use it?

How do you manage freeing buffers on rmdir? I don't see any bforget there.
If you don't free buffers pointing to deallocated space, it can cause data
corruption.
