The above SELinux policy looks similar to the one I wrote, but
that is not very true.  Because in my example, path name corresponds to a file
while local_shell_t are bound to multiple.
I understand the advantages of label, but it needs to be
translated to human understandable form of path name.
So I think pathname based call chains are advantages for
at least auditing and profiling.
