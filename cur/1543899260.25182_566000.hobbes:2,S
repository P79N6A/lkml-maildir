Not exactly. I assume you understand that rebooting 1000 live production
servers to find the source of a rare bug or the cause of a performance
issue is out of question.
Moreover, strategies like enabling flight recorder traces on a few nodes
on demand to detect performance problems can only be deployed in
production environment if they are part of the standard production
kernel.
Also, managing two different kernels is often out of question. Not only
is it a maintainance burden, but just switching to the "debug" kernel
can impact the system's behavior so badly that it could make the problem
disappear.
