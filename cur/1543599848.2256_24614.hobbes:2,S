Wake up harder!
Try reading the last 10 days kernel messages. The last 48 hours are
particularly rewarding.
To be honest, nobody has precisely formulated the problem. I'll attempt
a quick summary of the most salient:
  C silently transforms signed int to unsigned int in cross-signed
  comparisons. This results in 1U < -2, and gives rise to all kinds
  of error paths from min/max codes (in particular, but they're not
  all) of the form
     min(unsigned_positive_constant, signed_ok_or_error_value)
  whose authors were expecting to get the error value out when the
  error value went in!
There are apparently more problems too, but nobody has explained them
to me in a manner that I can comprehend. I suspect that nobody knows
the full range of possible faults. I put in the size comparison
that you remarked upon so that people could tell me about it. Tell me
about it.
Linus wants possible mistakes flagged. He specifically does not want
-Wsign-compare because it apparently gives false positives.
