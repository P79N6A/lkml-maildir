Thanks for replying Greg. I checked again, I have the hardware in my
system. I asked the vendor for bios update, but he says mine is the
latest version.
I downloaded the Intel "iasl" compiler
(
http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm
),  and
used it to decompile "/proc/acpi/dsdt" file (in AML) to its equivalent
ACPI source code. I could not find the _OSC and OSHP control methods
there. Is this information sufficient enough to deduce that I need a
BIOS update? And the hardware is OK but the problem is with the bios?
Just out of curosity, I would appreciate if you could provide me
pointers to OSHP and _OSC methods. What exactly do they mean? Does
every hardware containing a hot-plug controller necessarily has to
implement them both? I checked with ACPI Specs but it contains no
refrence to "OSHP" method.
Any pointers are more than appreciated,
TIA,
Rajat
