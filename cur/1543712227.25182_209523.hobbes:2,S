Have you considered any common ground your patch might share with the
people doing memory hotplug?

They have a similar problem to your migration that occurs when a user
wants to remove a whole or partial NUMA node.

Is your code something that you'd like to see go into the mainline 2.6
or 2.7 kernel?  
Also, please don't spam-encode your address when sending to the list. 
It just makes it harder for people to send feedback.
