I wasn't saying that.  However, I believe that the use of structures to
represent hardware devices is abserd.  All datasheets I have ever seen
describe devices as a set of offsets from the start address.
The raw information is numeric.  Why go to the pain of converting this to
a compiler-based structure, and then get the compiler to convert it back
to offsets again?  It's not like you're using typechecking or any other
features of a structure.
