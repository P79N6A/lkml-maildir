Look at it from a mail admin's perspective.  The bounces are now going 
nowhere instead of some poor user's mailbox.  You have just cut the damage 
in half.
Innerfire.net used to be foraged as a spam sender every other month and 
gmack@innerfire.net so often that I still have procmail filters to 
redirect bounces to their own folder.  The thousands of messages I was 
getting was infuriating but it has been a very rare event since I setup 
SPF on my domain.
SPF may not filter spam much but if you set it to autofail you can reduce 
the risk for innocent mail admins.
