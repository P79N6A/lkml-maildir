Hi,
Zwane suspected NMI spikes and advised me to disable nmi_watchdog
(nmi_watchdog=0).  After doing that, a kernel build completes
successfully, although with many messages like these:
Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 21.
Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 31.

I've also seen reason == 20.
This is on 2.6.9-rc4.
Andi, any ideas?
I've had several hundred of these messages, with only 1 dazed &
confused that did not continue OK.
Adding show_registers(regs); in the NMI handler points to
default_idle():
