Subject: Works with binutils-2.9.1.0.7+, versioning a non-issue? (was: Re: Boot code rewritten for GAS)

Works fine with 2.9.1.0.7 which is the absolute minimum required by 2.2's
Documentation/Changes (2.9.1.0.7). binutils-2.9.1.0.5 is when the bulk of
the bugs which I had found were squashed but again, Changes recommends at
least 2.9.1.0.7+
Seriously, it (should) break absolutely nothing and be a simple drop in
patch that will let you free up a few blocks on your space craving drive
by rm'ing as86/ld86. Please back me up here by testing it, eh? :)
Again I apologize for the terribly explained 'minimum version' situation.
In my mind I had the 'minimum version' and the 'version which I'd love to
see as the minimum, but is'nt' :)
