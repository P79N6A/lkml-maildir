Hi Jens!
Thanks for the sample code. I've trimmed the recipient list a bit...

Not here either, but let me check, if I understand this correctly:

I will give it another try, after clarifying the above questions - maybe
there is a command that will perform the desired task. If not, I guess
we're back at snooping what the Windows driver does here...
