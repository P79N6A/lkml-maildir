I recommend to check the latest cdrtools packet from:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/
At the same place, there is a patch for recent Linux systems
that allows cdrecord to sense the MAX DMA size for USB.
Do not use cdrecord derivates but the original as derivates may have bugs
that are not present in the original.
