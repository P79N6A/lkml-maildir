In this case, the bisection is probably not perfect,
because that original patch had a couple of bugs that
were fixed by a subsequent follow-up patch.
It is all rather fuzzy right now, because this work was all completed
at the merge window for the *previous* kernel, but has now sat bit-rotting
for nearly 6 months since I last looked at it.
That said, I'm building the latest 2.6.25-rc* to retest with here,
and hopefully we can work this out without much more fuss.
Cheers
