I think these old inlining bugs were just caused by missing __always_inline
(e.g. in the vsyscall code which requires forced inlining or in copy_*_user)
AFAIK these all have __always_inline these days and if any are still missing these
are easy to change over as needed.
So Ingo's change is likely ok.
