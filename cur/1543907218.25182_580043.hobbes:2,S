We're taking two setattr flags ATTR_KILL_SGID, and ATTR_KILL_SUID which
have existed for several years in the VFS, and making them visible to
the filesystems. Out-of-tree filesystems that care can check for them in
a completely backward compatible way: you don't even need to add a
#define.

It is not true "regardless": the in-tree code is being converted.
Out-of-tree code is the only "problem" here, and their only problem is
that they may have to add support for the new flags if they also support
suid/sgid mode bits.
Are you advocating reserving a new filesystem bit every time we need to
add an attribute flag?
