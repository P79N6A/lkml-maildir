[PATCH] sched: fix SMT scheduler bug
The SMT scheduler incorrectly skips kernel threads even if they are
runnable (but they are preempted by a higher-prio user-space task which got
SMT-delayed by an even higher-priority task running on a sibling CPU).
Fix this for now by only doing the SMT-nice optimization if the
to-be-delayed task is the only runnable task.  (This should cover most of
the real-life cases anyway.)
This bug has been in the SMT scheduler since 2.6.17 or so, but has only
been noticed now by the active check in the dynticks code.
