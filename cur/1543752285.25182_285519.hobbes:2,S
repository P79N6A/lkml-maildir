These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness. It is 
configurable to any workload but the default ck3 patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck3-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.

Changed since 2.6.10-ck2:
-nvidia_6111-6629_compat.diff
+nvidia_6111-6629_compat2.diff
Respun the nvidia compatibility patches to make them _really_ work with 
both the 6111 and 6629 drivers
-cfq-ts-050104.patch
+cfq-ts-19g.diff
Latest stable version of Jens' cfq-timeslices I/O scheduler with full 
I/O read and write priority support (stable and safe).
-2610ck2-version.diff
+2610ck3-version.diff
Version
Added:
+rt_ionice.diff
Set ionice level to best possible for real time tasks
+2.6.10-mm1-brk-locked.patch
+random-poolsize-int-overflow.diff
+rlimit-memlock-dos.diff
+scsi-int-overflow-information-leak.diff
+moxa-int-overflow.diff
A whole swag of security patches
+i2.8_i2.9.diff
+i2.9_i2.10.diff
This makes the SCHED_ISO scheduling far more robust. The soft realtime 
properties are more aggressive, and SCHED_ISO extends to -nice values 
behaviour as well now.
+s9.3_s9.4.diff
+s9.4_s10.diff
Behavioural bugs in the staircase scheduler were addressed. This brings 
up the version to staircase10. Specifically, s9.4 addresses yet another 
issue that would make tasks get stuck at lowest priority. s10 fixes the 
problem of frequent waking tasks (like sound servers) being seen as cpu 
bound.
+b2.6_b2.7.diff
First attempt at making batch tasks cooperate with swsusp. Does not 
succeed yet. You'll need to change batch tasks to SCHED_NORMAL if 
they're running to be able to suspend at the moment.
+cfq_writeprio_on.diff
Turn on the write priority support by default
