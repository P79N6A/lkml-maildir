I tried to raise the similar issue twice without success.

I think we should fix wake_up_process() instead.
Please look at 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118503598307267
and at this thread: 
http://marc.info/?t=116275561700001
In short: wake_up_process() doesn't imply mb(), this means that _in theory_
the commonly used code like
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	if (CONDITION)
		return;
	schedule();
is racy wrt
	CONDITION = 1;
	wake_up_process(p);
I'll be happy to be wrong though, please correct me.
Oleg.
