I assume he's referring to what's left after you take out the task
struct. More than 4 kiB, so 4 kiB is a conservative estimate.

I guess we should ask the question as to what's an acceptable usage.
Theoretically, any amount could pose a problem, but that's hardly a
useful position to work from. Some decision or guideline about a
practical limit would be helpful. My gut feeling is that 1 kiB is
around the limit for functions with a well defined call path. The
limit should probably be less for generic functions and interrupt
handlers.
