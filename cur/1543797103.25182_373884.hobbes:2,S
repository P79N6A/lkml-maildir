I wouldn't think that a database would be a problem since it is opened early
and then stays open.  However, point granted.  There are tools around, lsof
and such, which would be handy for diagnosing such a situation though.
I do know of other operating systems which do implement the semantics that I
have suggested and I don't think that they are concerned or have been 
notified
that these semantics for a problem.  These semantics are used because the
kernel itself can not even guarantee that the data that it is caching is 
valid,
without lots of synchronization which may tend to reduce performance.
    Thanx...
