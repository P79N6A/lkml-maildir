Chances are, you should replace the drive, because this sort of problem
usually gets worse as time goes on.
That said, it is possible for ext2 to mark the sectors bad (assuming you
use ext2 and not reiserfs), and then they will never be used.  You can
use the "badblocks" program in conjunction with e2fsck or mke2fs to mark
the blocks bad in the filesystem.
I would suggest keeping good backups after that.
Cheers, Andreas
