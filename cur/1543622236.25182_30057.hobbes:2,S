They fall through several function calls like they should.
I don't see any problem with preemtive scheduling (every kernel thread
has its own seperated exception frames). 
The overhead on the stack is 36 bytes for each exception frame (a
context of a try block). The unwinding procedure itself is short, the
throw macro calls a rather small asm function for an unwind.

Whether it is accepted or not, I can't see it being used in the core
kernel code, just because there is too much code to rewrite for it to
happen. Maybe if this thing was proposed back in 1992/3 it would have
been different.
But, it CAN be used in *local* driver call branches. Writing a new
driver? have a lot of local nested calls? Hate goto's? You can use
exceptions.
The only problem is that because C is natively not object oriented, it's
hard to come up with an exception scheme for the C language that is
better than ye' old goto's, like in C++ when you have automatic
destruction during unwinding.
