Looking first Linus's patch I guessed right what does it mean recursion
over a sempahore (not that there would be many other choices though ;). As
I just pointed out the write atomicity is not more garanteed from the
internal path of the same process (previously in such case we would
deadlock but sure we had no ways to corrupt things). It's still garanteed
that many processes working on a critical section protected by the same
semaphore will not mess up things.
