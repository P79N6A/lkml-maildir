You are of course right.
OTOH this is easy to solve... gcc -E and use resulting assembly after
verifying it (and probably cleaning it up).
BTW do not do the same mistake I did... I basically lost original .c
file. Make sure .c file is still there somewhere, so assembly can be
regenerated after big changes.
