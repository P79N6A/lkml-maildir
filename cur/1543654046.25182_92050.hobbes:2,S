I implemented the minimal subset: it's trivial to put back.  The
important question is why do you want it?  Do you only want it when
CONFIG_MODULES=y?  Do you only want the exported symbols, or all
symbols?
If this is for oprofile to figure out where modules are, then an entry
in /proc/modules seems more appropriate, yes?
Rusty.
