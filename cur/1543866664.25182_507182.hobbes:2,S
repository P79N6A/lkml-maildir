    Not that my opinion counts at all, but IMHO this is a VERY good
idea. OK, the kernel configuration system is not for the faint of heart
anyway, but doing it a bit more user-friendly is a good idea.
    Apart for user-friendlyness, which in itself is a good point, the
most important thing here is speed. Normally I have a base .config and I
work by adding/removing a couple of features, but being able to
deselect/select full submenus in just one checkbox is faster (and IMHO
less error prone, specially when your fingers fly across the keyboard)
than having to descend.
    Moreover, it adds a bit more of structure to the kernel
configuration. The first time it can be scary...
    So, I vote for that, even if my opinion doesn't count and I don't
have a vote. For me looks like a very good idea.
