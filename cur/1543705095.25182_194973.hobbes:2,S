I've narrowed the problem - it seems to be a specific optimisation bug with
gcc-3.2.3-24 that comes with RedHat 3ES. The problem is not kernel 
related (sorry!)
as the guts of the file exhibits the same problem when compiled in user 
space.
(All the non-sha256 test vectors in tcrypt.ko pass BTW.)
The older gcc32 that comes with Fedora Cora 1 and the gcc33 there get it 
right.
For the actual files please check bug #114610 in 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com
.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=114610
 - the bug report includes sha256.c, tcrypt.c, and types.h necessary to 
demonstrate
the problem in user space.
