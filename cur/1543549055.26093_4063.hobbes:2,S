Whatever the problem is, it's probably not a compiler issue.
He says it's fine with 2.2.x and breaks with 2.4.x. I've seen
the same on my system which is 2.4.0-test9 with egcs-1.1.2.
I cannot reliably reproduce it though, it only happens
occasionally, so I'm clueless as to what causes it.
*** To Theodore Y. Ts'o
This should probably be added to the 2.4.x bug-list. Since
Pavel seems to be able to constantly reproduce it, it should
be possible to track the problem down with his help.
Cheers,
Udo.
