Schedule is never executed from an interrupt, BUT, there may be
kernel threads or even user tasks that are sleeping, waiting
to be awakened when some preliminary interrupt processing has
occurred. The interrupt code may execute one of the wake-up calls
which will cause the target to be put into the run queue as soon
as possible.
