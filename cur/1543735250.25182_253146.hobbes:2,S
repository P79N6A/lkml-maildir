Alan:
The N_TTY ldisc global reference leak
is still in tty_io.c release_dev().
This does not currently cause a problem because
N_TTY is never deregistered. It seems
a little ugly to have the N_TTY reference
invalid when all other ldisc references
are maintained. I could see this subtle
difference biting someone in the future
when working with this.
The lines that cause the leak serve no
purpose. There is no reason to assign
N_TTY ldisc to a tty instance that
is then immediately thrown away. The lines
that drop the reference to the current ldisc
are, of course, still needed.
