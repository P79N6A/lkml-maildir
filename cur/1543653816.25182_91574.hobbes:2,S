  I'm afraid it's not.

  It does.
  I reread the discussion on this, and I still don't see what great
benefit the new loader brings, or why it was allowed to break all the
existing modules.
  A software interface is a contract between caller and service. As long
as it doesn't change you can rewrite either side of it without breaking
the other. That reduces maintenance and is something I thought was
standard software engineering, best practices, etc.
