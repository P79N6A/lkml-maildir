Thanks Jeff, this seems to fix the problem, and also fixes my problem with
the aic7xxx scsi driver ABORTing multiple times at startup (which I presumed
was unrelated).
However, the machine now crashes at "Configuring Kernel Parameters" during
rc initialisation:
        Welcome to Red Hat Linux
    Press 'I' for interactive startup
Mounting /proc filesystem...        [   OK   ]
Configuring Kernel Parameters...
This is if I type "linux noapic" at the Lilo boot prompt.
Also, what do I lose by running with noapic?
Thanks
Simon Garner
