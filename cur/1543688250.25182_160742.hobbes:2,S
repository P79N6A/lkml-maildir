The first one of these is wrong too. It'll stop some people from
being able to access existing file systems. This has to be fixed
properly (in both 2.4 and 2.6) to distinguish between 
"Can PIO LBA48" "Can DMA LBA48" and "no LBA48". The latter being
basically non existant.
If you fail to do this then existing PIO LBA48 setups will just die
on boot.
