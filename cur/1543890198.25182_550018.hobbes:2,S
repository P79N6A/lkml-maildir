Releasing loaded firmware for anything that needs to handle situations
like this just doesn't make sense.

Yeah, but these are just words, nothing people could use. Unfortunately
the author of this document died a few years ago.
Either the whole idea of userspace firmware-loading should be considered
as a problem impossible to do right because of its unsolvable side
effects. Or at least releasing loaded firmware should be the exception
for drivers which can be sure, that the firmware is not needed in
situations we try to work around here.
