Except for the places where cpu is a variable instead of smp_processor_id(),
those places might generate array access code.  I thought about using a
single set of macros and always defining irq_stat[NR_CPUS], trusting to
gcc to optimize the array access away for UP but decided to err on the
side of caution.  As for readability, almost all the existing code
defines SMP and UP versions, at least this patch reduces to one
definition instead of one per arch with subtly different definitions.
