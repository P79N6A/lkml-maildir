That's pretty much impossible, the best the kernel can do is send signals
to all of the running processes. If anything requires anything more
complicated (and many do) then even worse things will happen.

ext2 breaks the filesystem up into block groups, a while guess about the
error message would be that it couldn't find the block bitmap for a certain
group or the bitmap that it did find wasn't in the correct group.
