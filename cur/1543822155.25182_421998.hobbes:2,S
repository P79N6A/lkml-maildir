Hi Ingo, I've seen a few hangs with 2.6.16-rt17 - my feeling was that
they had to do with high network load - and this time something was left
behind after the reboot (I have to set up a serial console, it is not
happening very frequently). Most probably this does not say much but
here it goes anyway:
