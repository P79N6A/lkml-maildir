NACK.
Please see drivers/media/video/bt8xx/Makefile
You will notice the following line:
EXTRA_CFLAGS += -Idrivers/media/video
This instructs the compiler to find some other required headers in 
drivers/media/video (such as btcx-risc.h)
Your patch is unnecessary, and it is bad practice to use ".." inside a 
header includes path, IMHO at least.
In addition, please see the guidelines in 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches before you send any future patches.  We 
cannot accept patches into the linux kernel without a proper developer's 
certificate of origin.
Thank you for the effort, though :-)

Michael Krufky
