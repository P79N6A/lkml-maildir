Hello,
I have 2 questions regarding set_dma_addr(unsigned int channel,
unsigned int addr) helper.
1/  Why does the function take only one address ? I would expect it
to take both a source and a destination address for the dma controller
to transfer data.
2/ The type of address parameter is an unsigned int. Why isn't it a dma_addr_t
type ?
Thanks !
