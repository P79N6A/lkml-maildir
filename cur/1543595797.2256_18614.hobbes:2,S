As far as the Symbios driver is in concern, there is nothing to fix.
1) The bogus double reporting of PCI devices used (uses) 2 different
pci_dev structures.
2) The boot order has nothing to do with the kernel and must use the only
relevant way to identify PCI devices in a PCI BUS hierarchy (bus + devfn).

Btw, the suggested PCI bus numbering change looks like utter hackery to
me... Seems some guys somewhere are abusing tequilla too much. :-)
