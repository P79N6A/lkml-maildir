Hello all,
My daemon is nearing usable status. It has a few "quirks" but if this
interests you, please try it out! Comments, patches, flames, etc. welcome.
[README follows]
This is the first release of my memory quota and task priority daemon.
Per-user and per-task priorities are not yet implemented. Quotas are
handled on a per-user basis.
There is a "soft" and "hard" quota limit. Overcommit is explicitly
allowed. Limits are only enforced when the system virtual memory is low
(free memory < 1/8 total). Users exceeding their soft limits get SIGSTOP.
Users exceeding their hard limits get SIGKILL sent to tasks until they no
longer exceed the limit. The task selection is very basic right now, I
intend to make it more configurable and intelligent in the future.
System status is polled from /proc/ every [interval] seconds, where
[interval] is an optional command-line argument. The default interval is
10 seconds.
For now, the configuration file is just a list of pid's and quotas,
separated by whitespace. No comments are allowed! I didn't write a smart
parser.
This code is licenced under the GNU general public licence version 2.

Compile with: "gcc rpriod.c -o rpriod -O2 -Wall"
You can turn on extra logging by compiling with -DDEBUG. The syslog
information is sent to /var/log/secure (for Red Hat). You have to run it
as root. Standard disclaimer about running software as root applies. If it
breaks something, you get to keep both pieces. I will not responsible for
any damage. That being said, it works fine for me.
You should also get Rik van Riel's OOM killer patch. It can be found at:
