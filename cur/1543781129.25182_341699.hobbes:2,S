I had this problem when writing a kernel module that was using a UDP
socket to send and receive stuff. It would work fine in UML but fail in
the real kernel. I never worked it out but someone later patched it by
using the [gs]et_[df]s() functions. If you grep the kernel source you
can see a lot of places use it. The problem is I still have no idea why
it works...
Hope this helps,
