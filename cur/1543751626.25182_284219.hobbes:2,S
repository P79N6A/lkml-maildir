Some random docs say
The <tt>FS_NOMOUNT</tt> flag says that this filesystem must never
be mounted from userland, but is used only kernel-internally.
This flag was introduced in 2.3.99-pre7 and disappeared in Linux 2.5.22.
This was used, for example, for pipefs, the implementation of Unix pipes
using a kernel-internal filesystem (see <tt>fs/pipe.c</tt>).
Even though the flag has disappeared, the concept remains,
and is now represented by the MS_NOUSER flag.
