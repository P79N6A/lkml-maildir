So to make sure I understand all this...
The purpose of these services is to provide a platform independent API
for reading and writing 16, 32 and 64b values to MMIO devices. The
rationale for needing these services is that there is currently no
platform independent API for efficiently reading and writing these
values to BE devices on MMIO PCI devices. Examples are the mthca and
amso1100 devices.
Two classes of service are needed, atomic services that are interrupt
safe and services that either don't require atomicity or are called with
a suitable lock already held.
Does the API look something like this?
void mmio_wr_be16(__be16 val, void __iomem *addr);
void mmio_wr_be32(__be32 val, void __iomem *addr);
void mmio_wr_be64(__be64 val, void __iomem *addr);
void mmio_atomic_wr_be16(__be16 val, void __iomem *addr);
void mmio_atomic_wr_be32(__be32 val, void __iomem *addr);
void mmio_atomic_wr_be64(__be64 val, void __iomem *addr);
__be16 mmio_rd_be16(void __iomem *addr);
__be32 mmio_rd_be32(void __iomem *addr);
__be64 mmio_rd_be64(void __iomem *addr);
__be16 mmio_atomic_wr_be16(void __iomem *addr);
__be32 mmio_atomic_wr_be32(void __iomem *addr);
__be64 mmio_atomic_wr_be64(void __iomem *addr);
