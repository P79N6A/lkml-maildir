Given that (I'll check the driver in a sec), what's the correct way to
deal with this problem?  Should pcmcia-cs explicitly shut down the
interface before removing the card structures and modules?  Or should the
drivers in question force their own associated interfaces down as they are
being removed?  Or is it purely a kernel issue?
Obviously the pcmcia-cs solution is the quicker (not having to modify all
the drivers), but it may not be entirely portable (#ifdef it, I guess).
What I'm wondering is, what changed between 2.0 and 2.2 that caused this
behaviour change?  Given what I know of the networking code, the 2.2
behaviour is "correct" in the naive (non-PCMCIA) case, so what was it in
2.0 that made it work? 
TIA,
