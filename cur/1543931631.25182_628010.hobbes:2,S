Subject: [PATCH 0/4] pagetable unification: this time for sure!

Here's a new set of patches.  I've compiled tested:
    * 32-bit PAE paravirt
    * 32-bit non-PAE paravirt
    * 32-bit PAE non-paravirt
    * 32-bit non-PAE non-paravirt
    * 64-bit
and test-booted them to usermode under kvm (though I'm currently typing
this under 32-bit PAE paravirt).
The patches are based on linux-2.6-x86.git commit
022b7918fe3ac93ea171558e95d391efe82af4bb.
The net effect of these patches is little more than refactoring and code
motion, though I wouldn't expect the generated code to be identical.
