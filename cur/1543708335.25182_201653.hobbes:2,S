Yes, and it's already broken. When putting a lot of stress to the
filesystem data corruption pops up.
It turned out the hmac code uses an additional scratch pad which is used
in crypto_hmac_final (the "opad") which was kmalloc'ed. So it isn't even
inside the context (the one after struct tfm with length cra_ctxsize).
Why that? That kmalloc could have been avoided and the opad could store
after the tfm struct too (or on the stack of the crypto_hmac_final or is
it too large?). Yes, I know, ... but it would really be nice not to put
locks around the calls.
