Hi Adam.

It's moved slightly...

I've just had a look at porting it, and I note the following:
 1. The patch to mm/vmalloc.c patches the function vremap which
    appears not to exist in 2.2.9 ???
 2. The patch to the configuration help file doesn't apply very
    well, as it quotes configuration options that no longer exist.
I'll see what I can do with it though...
Best wishes from Riley.
