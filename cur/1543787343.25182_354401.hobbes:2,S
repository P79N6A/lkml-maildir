Oh I guess you're referring to the messy memory stuff in ALSA code?
(Or you mean about the foo_t style?  Then it would be easy to fix, and
 I'd appreciate if someone takes this job :)
Basically I agree with all your suggestions - hacks have been there
simply as workarounds.  They should be removed.
The following are in WIP on my local tree:
- Merge of dma_alloc_coherent() hacks for pages <32bit to kernel core
  (for i386 and ppc)
- PageReserve and mmaps:
  dma_mmap_coherent() will be used in all architectures instead of
  vma nopage callback.  Of course, dma_mmap_coherent() should be
  ported to all archs.
- Removal of the common allocator in sound/core/memalloc.c
  Instead, each driver has alloc_buffer() and free_buffer()
  callbacks. 
  (The reason to have callbacks is that the buffers can be allocated in
   3 places: by the pre-allocator, by proc control and at each open /
   hw_params setup.)
What I'm still considering are:
- The "right" way to allocate/mmap coherent SG-buffers.
- A common API for mmap vmalloc buffers.
- Subsystem or module-wide check of memory leaks in slab
  (the notorious kmalloc wrapper)
Please let me know if you have any good solutions, comments or
suggestions for the above.
thanks,
Takashi
