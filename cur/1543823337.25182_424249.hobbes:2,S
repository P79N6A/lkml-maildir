There are no differences in i2c patches between 2.6.17-rc3-mm1 and
2.6.17-rc4-mm1. As you said the bug is new in 2.6.17-rc4-mm1, this
suggests that the bug is not in the i2c patches. Could be that these
patches need to be updated to reflect a recent change in another tree
though.
I'll try to reproduce the bug here.
