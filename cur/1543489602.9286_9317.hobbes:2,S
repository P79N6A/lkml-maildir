One very strange thing for me was that a glibc version of amp skipped
but a libc5 binary didn't. The libc binary was one that I got from
somewhere and these days I just copy that one around where-ever I need
it ... very strange and I haven't investigated again for several months
so perhaps I imagined it all ... I must get around to sorting it out
properly one of these days.

Yes ... good ideas. I've been too lazy to do anything other than my
buffer hack. I've tried getting the cd spindown changed with hdparm but
haven't had much luck with that ... the cd drive seems trashy as it
periodically seems to get reset by the ide driver to keep it in shape.

An accident ... I thought I'd copied everything from my old drive before
I trashed it but I hadn't :(
I haven't had linux trash any of my disks ever :)
I'm going to be using my linux box as my primary workstation in a few
weeks so I'll be forced to sort out funny mp3 problems then .... if I
discover anything interesting wrt. skipping mp3's I'll post something
to the list.
