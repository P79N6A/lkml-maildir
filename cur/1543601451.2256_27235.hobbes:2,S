I would amend that a bit - it doesn't seem to have to be only two SCSI
drivers, because I've seen the same with a 2.4.9-ac9 system with aic7xxx
(with sg, sd, and sr) combined with usb-storage (which also uses sd).
Granted usb-storage is kinda pseudo-SCSI, but it's not truly a SCSI
low level driver.
