Hi!
The latest kernel seems to breake the loop device. I used 2.4.13 before, and
everything was fine. I didn't change my kernel config when upgrading.
I compile the loop device as a module. trying to modprobe/insmod it, I get the
following error message:
unresolved symbol in loop.o: deactivate_page
I did a 
# grep -R "deactivate_page" * 
in linux-2.4.14: there is no other occurances of deactivate_page in the whole
linux source. 
the patch file shows, that the function "deactivate_page" has been removed
(probably replaced by some similar function). but it seems that nobody updated
loop.c.
I hope you can help
regards
Jonas
