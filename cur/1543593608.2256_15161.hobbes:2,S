Thanks for the info. I dug a bit that OSF stuff (on Compaq's testdrive
boxes), and found no traces of 32-bit addressing support in the OSF kernel.
Everything seems to be done by dynamic linker (i.e. /sbin/loader) in user
space.

Same in /usr/include/coff_dyn.h, True64 v5.1.

I don't think so. The EF_ALPHA_32BIT in the ELF header flags
is elegant and easy to use. Unlike this, RHF_USE_31BIT_ADDRESSES is
not in the headers, but somewhere in .dynamic section. And what
about a static binary calling mmap()? ;-)
BTW, OSF/1 manpages say nothing about first argument of mmap(2) being
just a hint:
...
PARAMETERS
  addr      Specifies the starting address of the new region (truncated to a
            page boundary).
  len       Specifies the length in bytes of the new region (rounded up to a
            page boundary).
...
Ivan.
