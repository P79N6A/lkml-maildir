Yes, all of it is well tested and has been in CVS for a while.

How should we handle this with CVS? Should people add a
Signed-off-by: line to the CVS commit log? If they don't,
can I assume that "by policy" the Signed-off-by: line for
the committer is implicit? Or do I have to bug them to
mail me the Signed-off-by: line?
Thanks,
Johannes
