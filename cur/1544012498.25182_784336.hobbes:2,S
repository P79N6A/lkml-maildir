Subject: [PATCH] sparseirq: set lock_class for legacy irq when sparse_irq is selected
Impact: add lockdep annotation to legacy IRQ descs
Warnings resulting out of this were not seen in practice, but it's prudent
to initialize the legacy descriptors to the lock class as well, symmetric
to how we do it with other descriptors.
