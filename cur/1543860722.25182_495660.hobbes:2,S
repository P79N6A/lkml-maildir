Wait, at first I thought I understood this, but looking closer, I'm not
so sure I do.

Wait, so second_overflow should be called every NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ times
(instead of every second)? Surely that's not right.

This would assume that clock->cycle_interval would *always* be the
length of a full second and that isn't what the patch trying to do.
Maybe could you explain this some more?
