After unintentionally deleting some file, I noticed what appears to be
an incosistency (or at least a change) in ext3.  Running debugfs and
executing the command "lsdel", I saw no inodes listed since I last ran
the partition as ext2.  Does ext3 not add its deleted inodes to whatever
list ext2 does?  And can this be fixed without compromising the speed or
data-integrity of ext3?
