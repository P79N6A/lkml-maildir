Subject: [PATCH] Resetting packet statistics
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

These patches keep getsockopt(PACKET_STATISTICS) from resetting the packet
stats to zero and it creates PACKET_RESET_STATISTICS, which is used with
setsockopt(), to zero the packet stats.

Before I start: This is a diff from 2.6.14 and I am not subscribed so please CC
me on any replies.
I doubt I'm the only one who's a little annoyed that we have to keep track of the
packet count in userland after getsockopt(PACKET_STATISTICS). I did a little
searching but didn't find a patch similar to this so I'm not sure if I'm the only
one who thinks this is a generally Good Thing or not.
The ways these affect programs:
1) Programs can set the packet count to zero at anytime without having to make a
struct tpacket_stats just to reset it with getsockopt()
2) Programs don't need extra variables to hold packet counts (think libpcap),
they just call getsockopt(PACKET_STATISTICS) multiple times for updated stats.
NOTE:
The second patch adds PACKET_RESET_STATISTICS to include/linux/if_packet.h, but I
don't know if it's okay to #define it as "7" since that was PACKET_COPY_THRESH's
value. I did it so that the two PACKET*STATISTICS macros would be next to each
other. I checked the glibc header netpacket/packet.h and it doesn't even define
PACKET_COPY_THRESH so it shouldn't cause any problems (that I can see).
Thanks!
