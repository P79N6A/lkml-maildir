Good.

What are the BIOS people smoking? I thought they have left some old
tables there, but they keep updating them...

Well, I wanted some way to detect exactly this broken machine. You
might want to simply put == 8 there.. but proper solution is DMI blacklist.

Yes.

Well, the original BIOS has not only maximum values wrong, but also
1600MHz wrong, as far as I can tell...
Something like /proc/frequencies file would be needed where you could
echo "0 0xa; 0x8 0x6; 0xa 0x2" > /proc/frequencies to override. You
need to override all of them, not just top one.
