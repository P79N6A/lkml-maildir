Subject: [PATCH 1/4] pfnmap: fix 2.6.15-rc3 driver breakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've not tested any of them, but believe 2.6.15-rc3 will suffer from
premature freeing of pages in the case of the following drivers:
arch/ia64/kernel/perfmon.c
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/ftape-ctl.c
drivers/media/video/cpia.c
drivers/media/video/em28xx/em28xx-video.c
drivers/media/video/meye.c
drivers/media/video/planb.c
drivers/media/video/vino.c
drivers/media/video/zoran_driver.c
drivers/media/video/zr36120.c
drivers/usb/class/audio.c
drivers/usb/media/ov511.c
drivers/usb/media/pwc/pwc-if.c
drivers/usb/media/se401.c
drivers/usb/media/sn9c102_core.c
drivers/usb/media/stv680.c
drivers/usb/media/usbvideo.c
drivers/usb/media/vicam.c
drivers/usb/media/w9968cf.c
drivers/video/gbefb.c
drivers/video/sbuslib.c
net/packet/af_packet.c
About twenty drivers fill in their mmap vma by applying remap_pfn_range
repeatedly, many of them using vmalloc_to_pfn: vm_pgoff will match only
the last range or page mapped in, and the others will be considered
normal by vm_normal_page - thus although they were not counted in by
remap_pfn_range, they will be counted out by zap_pte_range, so freed
well before the driver has finished with them (and frees them again).
A temporary hack (checking for PageAnon and ZERO_PAGE) sure to disgust
Linus, but keep those drivers safe until the proper solution arrives.
