ECC tries to repair some transmission loss (what it stands for ; ))
Maybe those entries appeared disparately to relate some
_independant_ non cohesive datas or in one shot to signal
repetitive correction tries ... AFAIK problem isn't 
kernel relevant at all, as kernel won't have to manage
ECC by itself (motherboard side).
