Hi folks,

I've just fought through this thread, maybe missed some points, 
and I'll try no to repeat to repeat arguments already said, but:
IMHO, many of the filesystems should belong to userland, 
(especially those I'd call "exotic"). Maybe some decision points:
* high complexity (-> not easy to debug)
* not required for booting 
* not yet matured (within kernel) 
* not performance critical
* requires much userland assistance
* not used permanently (just from time to time)
* not actually an IPC mechanism
My first candidate would be coda: 
It never worked well for me, even often have to reload the 
kernel driver. As most of the logic already *is* in userland, 
there wouldn't be a performance tradeoff when doing the kernel
interface entirely via FUSE or even let venus just be an 9P server.
