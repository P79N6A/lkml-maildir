Sure. Then it's not assembly. It's some polymorphic conglomeration
of crap ......... don't get me started.  If you write in assembler,
please learn to use the assembler. Assembly is not 'C'.
Use the right tool for the right thing. Both are tools, the fact
that you can shovel with an axe does not make the axe a shovel.
