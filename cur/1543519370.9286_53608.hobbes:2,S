Hmm. I think the standards say "If the directory on which a file system
is to be mounted is a symlink, the fs is mounted on the dir to which
the symlink refers" - will check later.
Also, think of the very common case where people mount a CDROM
on /dev/cdrom which is a symlink to /dev/sr0 or /dev/hdc or so.
