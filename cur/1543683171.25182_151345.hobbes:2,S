Subject: [PATCH] bad strlcpy conversion breaks toshiba_acpi
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Please revert the following item from Ben Collins' "drivers/* strlcpy 
conversions" patch dated 2003-May-26.
The strlcpy function requires a zero-terminated string, which is not a 
valid assumption for the code in question.  I suggest that Ben review 
all such modifications he made to the kernel for similar errors.  It's 
quite annoying to have someone add bugs to your driver while you're not 
looking.  Either notify the maintainer of your patch or don't make mistakes.
Another gripe I have is that bitkeeper user "bcollins" does not have a 
valid email address.
