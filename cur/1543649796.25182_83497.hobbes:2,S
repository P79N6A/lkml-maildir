Caveat coder -- you also have to handle the case where the device is 
already gone, by the time you are notified of the hot-unplug event. 
 Some ejections are less friendly than others...  though from a SCSI 
standpoint, hopefully that case is easier -- error out all I/Os in 
flight, and unregister the host and device structures associated with 
the recently-removed host.  The devil, of course, is in the details ;-)
