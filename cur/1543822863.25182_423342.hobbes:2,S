    Revert mount/umount uevent removal
    This change reverts the 033b96fd30db52a710d97b06f87d16fc59fee0f1 commit
    from Kay Sievers that removed the mount/umount uevents from the kernel.
    Some older versions of HAL still depend on these events to detect when a
    new device has been mounted.  These events are not correctly emitted,
    and are broken by design, and so, should not be relied upon by any
    future program.  Instead, the /proc/mounts file should be polled to
    properly detect this kind of event.
    A feature-removal-schedule.txt entry has been added, noting when this
    interface will be removed from the kernel.

    [PATCH] remove mount/umount uevents from superblock handling
    The names of these events have been confusing from the beginning
    on, as they have been more like claim/release events. We needed these
    events for noticing HAL if storage devices have been mounted.
    Thanks to Al, we have the proper solution now and can poll()
    /proc/mounts instead to get notfied about mount tree changes.
