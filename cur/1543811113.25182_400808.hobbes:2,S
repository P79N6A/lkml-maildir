Yes, I should have been more clear. I meant to say that perhaps I should use
the 4 combinations of OS configs (non-RT/RT x UniProc/SMP) and use zc  and
cyclesoak rather than do a 20 node test, but I believe I will need many nodes
sending to my one "monitor" node to get this high packet receive rate of
about 38,000/second. Lower rates involving only a single machine should also
be capable of revealing conclusively that "RT-SMP" kernels are some factor
heavier than non-RT-UniProc kernel. Anyway, I will do the tests.
