Hi!

> Here's what I have after today's work.
> 
> I haven't yet been able to test on x86, but can confirm that it works okay on x86_64. I'm currently working towards testing it on my old Omnibook. My P4 desktop won't resume from suspend to ram at all, and hasn't produced any beeps.
> 
> I needed to move the BEEP invocation to after the data segment is reloaded, so that the test could access the variable. That was pretty tricky to find - no oops or anything bad prior, it just didn't beep when expected.

> A couple of notes:
> 
> - I'd like to put the BEEP macro somewhere that can be shared by x86 32 and 64. If that's a good idea, any suggestions on where? Nothing occurs to me straight off.
> - I've just switched from Evo to Kmail. Please let me know if there's any mangling of the patch.

Can we rename/reuse existing flag variable?
