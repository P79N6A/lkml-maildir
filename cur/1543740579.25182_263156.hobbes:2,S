It should be possible to be clever about this.  Most processes don't use their 
timeslice, so if we have a previous timer running, just keep track of how much 
beyond that timer our timeslice will be.  If we context switch before the timer 
expiry, well and good.  If the timer expires, set it for what's left of our 
timeslice.
