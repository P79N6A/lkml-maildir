Jurgen,
Which version of cdparanoia (or whatever) are you using?
You mention deadlock, is the machine completely locked
up or is sg and the device inoperable? Since sg doesn't
take any "big" locks (e.g. io_request_lock) then it
shouldn't be able to lock up your machine without help
(from other drivers).
Assuming you can still execute commands on your box after the
"deadlock", I'm interested in WCHAN from ps. Here are some
ps variants:
  ps -eo cmd,wchan
  ps -eo fname,tty,pid,stat,pcpu,wchan
  ps -eo pid,stat,pcpu,nwchan,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o args
The line for cdparanoia would be useful.
BTW ps needs to find the correct System.map for
the WCHAN output to be relevant.
