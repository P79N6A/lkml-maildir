Indeed, I suspect that this isn't wanted.
With the cond->lock you almost prevent this: an ongoing broadcast
can't be intermixed with newly incoming waiters (they will block
on futex_down(&cond->lock))
But there is the window between a->b...

Right after (a) another thread gets scheduled, issueing a signal/broadcast.
Ah, and then the futex_down_timed() wouldn't block, OK ;-)
But this way you have to use the ack->lock
I strongly believe, that the implementation of a condvar needs a lock
to prevent intermixed calls. You will see my comment on your implementation
with uwaitq. ;-)
