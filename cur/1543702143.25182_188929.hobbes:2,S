Is there any special setting to be made for the new kernel? I have used module-init-tools-0.9.14 to install the modules.
Additionally, I've seen hangs with eepro100 with some chipset-buildin
eepro100 variants in newer Intel chipsets. The e100 driver (provided by
Intel, but already included in Linux' sources) seems to work around some
chipset bugs...
