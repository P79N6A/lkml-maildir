For what processor?  x86, itanium, sparc, s390 all do it differently.
Also, the answer to "this *very* instruction" is different from
"where this instruction was when we trapped/kdbg/interrupt/whatever
it so we could look at the current process/thread/worker state".
In other words, are you trying to answer "Where in memory am *I*?"
or "Where in memory is <that very recent code I want to look at>?"
(Hint - for the former, you can probably get very good approximations
by just looking at the entry point address for the function:
	(void *) where = &__FUNCTION__;

In user space, you probably want either mmap() or dlopen(), depending what it
is you're trying to do, most likely...
In kernel space, you'll have to be more specific as to what you're
trying to do, but you're always welcome to write a replacement for
fs/binfmt_elf.c :)

What are you trying to achieve here?  It's unclear what you're
hoping will happen....
