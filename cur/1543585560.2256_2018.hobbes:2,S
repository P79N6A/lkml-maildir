Simple, you reclaim a few of those uptodate buffers.  My testing here has
resulting in more of my system daemons getting killed than anything else, and
it never once has solved the actual problem of simple memory pressure from
apps reading/writing to disk and disk cache not releasing buffers quick
enough.

I beg to differ.  If you tell me that a machine that looks like this:
[dledford@monster dledford]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1017800    1014808       2992          0      73644     796392
-/+ buffers/cache:     144772     873028
Swap:            0          0          0
[dledford@monster dledford]$ 
is in need of killing sshd, I'll claim you are smoking some nice stuff ;-)
