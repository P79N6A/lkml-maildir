Yes it does.  Without "volatile", the asm disappears :-)

The compiler isn't moving memory references around "asm volatile", but
it is doing CSE around them to _eliminate_ memory references.
Thus spin_lock needs the memory clobber, to prevent CSE of non-volatile
memory references between the critical region and outside the critical
region.
Maybe spin_unlock doesn't need one because CSE doesn't work the other
way.  (I'd put that clobber in anyway, to be sure).
