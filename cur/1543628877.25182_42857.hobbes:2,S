Actually, those words were carefully chosen. There *has* been a lot of
repeated shouting about this topic. I want to highlight the stupidity
and futility of dragging the list through another pointless flamewar.
I've used similar language elsewhere in the FAQ for other repeat
flamewars or pointless debates.
The bottom line is: no matter how many times you scream, Linus won't
change his mind because of the BK licence. The FAQ entry is accurate.
