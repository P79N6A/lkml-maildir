Yes, it would probably be more appropriate to use DEFINE_PER_CPU()
for 'pf_reason' and 'cpu_trace', but I wasn't sure since the examples
of DEFINE_PER_CPU I saw always had integers or pointers, not
whole structs. Is it okay for whole structs?
'dropped' on the other hand is not accessed in per-cpu style, any cpu
may access any element. DEFINE_PER_CPU is not valid here, is it?
Thanks for the note, I knew I should fix that at some point.
