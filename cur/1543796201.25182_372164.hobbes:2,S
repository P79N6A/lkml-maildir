Hi Scott,
	Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  Your patch will break previous
kernels, which have a smaller structure.  I've had the discussion years
ago with the input people on using module aliases, and it's not entirely
trivial.  I will prepare another patch, however.
Meanwhile, as noone seems to use swbit in struct input_device_id,
perhaps we can remove it for 2.6.15?

Hmm, well, the answer to that is the same as above.  ccw should have
support now, so it's just input we're missing I think.
