Well, one concern is an intentional exploit.  In which case "longer
time" and "shorter time" don't matter -so- much.  If it can happen at
all, it's bad, period.
OTOH if one filesystem (say, pipes) can wrap the numbers very quickly,
while other spaces are otherwise more immune, then having it global puts
everything using it at a bit more risk.
*shrug* I dunno, it's probably not worth arguing this point, it needs to
be fixed properly in any case. :)
