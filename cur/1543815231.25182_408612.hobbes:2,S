This depends on your hardware. I was reading the Sossaman data sheet the 
other day, and it says that the entire chip must run at the same 
frequency. You can set each core to a different frequency, but the 
hardware chooses the higher of the two. Likewise, the entire chip can 
sleep, but individual cores can only go into C1. I imagine the Core Duo 
is the same.
IIRC, the dual-core Opterons behave a little differently but the two 
cores still have to run at the same frequency.
