Older versions of the iBase FWA7304 BIOS have a bug that causes the
system to use way too much power when you run 'init 0', causing
the power brick to burn out after about 3 hours.
The fix for this is to get an updated BIOS from the manufacturer:
IB798F-T2-CP1A-1229
The problem still happens if you enable ACPI, but at least it seems
fixed if you disable ACPI.
Hope this helps someone!
