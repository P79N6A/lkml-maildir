Yes, log nowhere instead of running in a loop would be much better
than loading a 5:1 driver which will never exist as a module.

It's obviously more useful than not to boot up.

No, the pci driver will never get loaded by modprobe 5:1, that's all
what this bug is about. It connects to the existing console device
when the driver is loaded, and at that moment /dev/console gets
working.
