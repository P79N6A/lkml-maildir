2nd post (previous attempt was reformatted, courtesy of Microsoft Exchange)
Description: Fixes problem with external loopback, using crossed route
entries.
Version: 2.0.36
Testing: Connected two NICs together, using an extenal cross-over cable,
         swapped route entries (to force packets out the opposite
interfaces),
         and then issued pings to both addreseses.  Unplugged cable to
verify
         pings were appropriately halted.
Request: Please CC bmoyle@redcreek.com with any comments/feedback.  Thanks!
