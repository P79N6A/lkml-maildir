THAT case is certainly a rather strong argument for using something
like "gsc_read[bwl]()" on HP-PA.
If the gsc bus is similar enough to PCI that you might end up sharing some
drivers, that can probably be accomplished by double-compiling them, once
with "-Dwritel=gsc_writel" kinds of tricks. But trying to make the same
driver handle both cases dynamically sounds like madness.
(Considering that the init and finding functions are likely to be
completely different anyway, you probably don't want to share drivers
other than possibly in the "8390" sense.. Who knows..)
