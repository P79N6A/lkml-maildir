maybe it's just me... but it looks like if as SCSI device the whole thing is
slower than with IDE. i haven't tested it yet, but as sda the system load is
very high, i did some tests with dd, and the CPU usage is always at 98-100%.
and when i'm copying something to another disk, the other programs barely move,
sometimes even the mouse gets stuck. i dunno where this is coming from. i
thought i try with the old driver.
maybe if you could give me some hints about how to test the whole thing, i
could post some results. i know that driver change isn't the answer, but i
still wanted to know if one can switch between the old and the libata driver
without recompiling (with some boot parameters to the kernel perhaps).
