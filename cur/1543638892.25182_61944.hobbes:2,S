Funny. Do you mean that your BIOS used SETMAX ?

Yes. I already advised this maintainer to add -C,-H,-S options to fdisk
(cfdisk and sfdisk already have them), and he did so immediately.
Visible one of these weeks in util-linux-2.11v.

Since geometry does not exist, it is not surprising that everybody
invents something else. Not only do kernel and BIOS differ, but
BIOS is not consistent internally.
For a while, with disk sizes between 500 MB and 8 GB, maximum DOS-accessible
capacity was obtained by H=255 S=63. But IDE accepts at most 16 heads, so
H=255 requires a translating BIOS. For sizes above 8 GB the translation
is useless and will only take some small amount of time.
Setting the disk to Normal (instead of Large / LBA / Extended or so)
works best.
So, I have two questions:
1. What precisely do you mean with "actively refused" ?
2. Is there a Windows or Netware reason to prefer extended translation
above no translation?
