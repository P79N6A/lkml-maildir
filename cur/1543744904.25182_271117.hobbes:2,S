Ah you found the case I didn't mention :-) Yes, that's handled
somewhere else. When the ABISS elevator sees a barrier, it just
pushes the current sort tree for non-reads (writes and weird
stuff) to a FIFO list.
So writes don't benefit that much from priorities. The good
thing is that they also happen to need them less ;-)
Hmm, I just see that power down (suspend and shutdown) sneaked out
again. Well, easy enough to fix.

I know. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a nice alternative
that doesn't either require additional fields (e.g. in MM, only half
of the key is not stored in the tree, the other half is calculated)
or *very* busy callbacks.
Of course, if Rajesh or the MM folks in general think that storing
the whole key in the tree is fine, I wouldn't complain :-)

Ah no, the ABISS elevator won't go into the kernel - it's just for
experimenting. But Jens is planning to add the overlap handling to
the block device layer. So the user is well on its way :-) It's just
more convenient if we can do this one step at a time, particularly
since prio_tree is a very general concept (much like lists or
red-black trees) anyway.

Cool. Thanks !
