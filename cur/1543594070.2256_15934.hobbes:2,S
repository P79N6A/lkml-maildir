This is not correct. Kernel 2.4.5-ac13 and later have a driver to
support the Fasttrak 
raid system. I wish Promise was more helpful during the development of
this driver,
as it is currently developed fully independent and without any help /
support or even
acknowledgement of Promise. As a result, not yet all RAID modes and
configurations are
fully supported.
