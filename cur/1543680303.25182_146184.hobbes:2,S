Nothing. You'll have more context switches in average but if you think
that the context switch time will be diluted in tenths on ms runs you'll
get nothing. I really don't like to talk w/out being backed up by numbers
but currently I am really overbooked with other tasks and I cannot follow
up this (even if I'd like to). I am currently working 12-14 hours/day on
average, and I am one of those unperfect machines that still needs 6-7
hours rest somewhere during the day :)
(but I'll do it later if Ingo does not return from Mars or if someone else
does not do it)
