Please?
I would like to provide the least ammount of new functionality that is
really necessary in my audio kernels. Audio related requirements include
the rt patch but not a new scheduler.

It looks to my untrained eye like it is CFS related, I'm attaching the
last part of the strace of firefox while it tries to load a flash site.
The firefox process is left in an unkillable (not even by -9) state.
What else could I provide to debug the problem? (this is in a T61 laptop
with the Intel 7700 processor).
