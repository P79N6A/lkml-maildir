Once again: there is no duplicate routes in the kernel! It's just that
'route' command doesn't see the attributes that make the difference...
You usally get those 'duplicate' when  you add a route to the networks
attached  to your  own interfaces.  And asking  to delete  those route
shouldn't be an issue  in the first place. Or it means  that you put a
wrong netmask!
