It's not clear here what direction the data is being transferred in.  Is it
mostly client->server, or mostly server->client?
What filesystem is the server using?

OK well that's a good step: break the problem down to the simplest possible
operation.
In which direction was the file transferred?  client to server or server to
client?  What kernel was running on each?
As next steps I'd suggest that you log into the server and do
	time (dd if=/dev/zero of=x bs=1M count=2048 ; sync)
and
	time (dd if=x of=/dev/null bs=1M count=2048 ; sync)
(this assumes that the machine has less that 2G of memory, to avoid caching
effects).
And then run the same two commands across NFS.
So break it down to the simplest possible step which exhibits the problem.
