That's what I meant. I shouldn't have used the word "break" :-)
In case of slab, freeing up of resources on an error during CPU_UP_PREPARE,
is currently handled in CPU_UP_CANCELLED.
But, like you reasoned out, it makes more sense for such a subsystem
to free up all the correctly allocated resources before sending a
NOTIFY_BAD, rather than handling it in CPU_UP_CANCELLED. And slab 
needed that fix, which you've provided, before we send the notification
to (nr_calls - 1) callers.
So could you add this patch to series? 
Thanks and Regards
