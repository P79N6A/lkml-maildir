Very informative answer, thanks ;-).

Exacty, but I understand it differently.

Nope, drive->id is what drive says it can do,
but also what it currently does.

drive->id also reports *current* active mode
(it changes on a drive itself).

After issuing SET_MAX_ADDRESS or SET_MAX_ADDRESS_EXT hardware drive->id
is updated and we are using this information, so disk reports to us geometry,
nope?

This is a show-stopper only for changing HDIO_GET_IDENTITY semantics,
not driver itself (we can have separate drive->boot_id for this).
I am starting to think that drive->id (reflecting actual identity) and
drive->boot_id (saved boot drive->id) is a long-term solution.
