Pausing the database != putting the database into readonly mode, which is 
all that would really be required.  If your writer-processes are distinct 
from your reader-processes, you could suspend them (and/or batch up writes 
to temp tables to shrink your externally-felt maintenance window), tell 
the DB to flush pending writes, then dump with O_STREAMING-aware tar (or 
db-specific tools that still must pass through all tables/files) while 
read performance is only somewhat impacted, and cache isn't completely 
killed. 
Or, consider the case where the database isn't anywhere near all that the 
system does.  Think static content + DB-driven webserver, where the DB 
*can* be completely shut down (and those parts unavailable) during 
backups, while static content serving still goes on efficiently.
