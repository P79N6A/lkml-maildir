Thank to all of you !
I tested it: on 2.2.9, there is no 'kupdate' process, so
'/sbin/update' is mandatory and does its job perfectly.
Although, in 2.2.13, 'kupdate' runs, and as Andrea says, if I
run '/sbin/update', it cleanly exits after a few seconds.
So we should notify everybody: whatever kernel version you are
running, _ALWAYS_ start '/sbin/update', it'll know if it is needed
or not. This will save time and headache to lot of people.
Best technical support is for me Linux: problem solved in less
than 12 hours :-)
