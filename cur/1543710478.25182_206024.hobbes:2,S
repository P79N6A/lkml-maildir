I'm working on an automated scheme to measure the growth of the kernel
from release to release. The current methodology is to do comparisons
from x to y, with the default config for x in both cases.  This is
automated with bloat-o-meter from linux-tiny and my kpatchup script
(
http://selenic.com/kpatchup
) plus a couple glue scripts. I intend to
post these reports regularly with new releases so comments on
improving the content are appreciated.
Here's a current sample report [with some explanatory comments
interspersed].
2.6.3 -> 2.6.4
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
3313135	 660247	 162472	4135854	 3f1bae	vmlinux-2.6.3-c2.6.3
3342019	 664154	 162344	4168517	 3f9b45	vmlinux-2.6.4-c2.6.3
[ Results of size <a> <b>. -c2.6.3 means both kernel images were built
with the 2.6.3 defconfig. The dec column tells us that the 2.6.4
kernel image has grown by almost 1% in one release. Output from
bloat-o-meter follows.]
add/remove: 241/88 grow/shrink: 380/265 up/down: 44772/20838
[ A quick summary of modifications. 241 new symbols in 2.6.4, 88
disappeared, 380 functions grew, 265 shrank, and total growth and
shrinkage of listed symbols]
[ Next we list the growth and shrinkage of given functions, sorted by
delta. Symbols that aren't present in a given version are reported as
- and treated as size zero. I'm currently only listing the top 15 gainers
and decliners in the report to keep things manageable, though
bloat-o-meter will generate a complete list. ]
