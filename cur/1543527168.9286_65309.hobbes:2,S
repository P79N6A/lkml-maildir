you can try - but it doesn't work (unless you are in the PRIV-SU mode). It's
the wrong environment for it to function. I tried it, and couldn't get the
right envrionment for it to work. Only the labeled daemons were able to setup
the environment, then the shell has to request the change it. It appears (the
manpage) that the system call uses the current PID to determine the
process tree (setulvl doesn't have a PID parameter).
The reason it doesn't really work is that making such security changes
outside the top level environment permits security leaks. Lets take an
example:
   a process exists with the proper level and creates a pipe to a
   child.
   Now the parent process changes security levels to a higher level.
   The information leak is provided by processing activity of the higher level
   (covert channel). A more direct leak is open file id between processes.
The direct leak can be covered by having the change level (setulvl)  system
call close any open files. It is not possible to fully close the covert
channel. The level switch itself causes a one bit transfer - the child can
no longer have a ligitimate group head - signals sent to the higher level
process (say, terminate) cause the re-parenting of the process tree. The
timing of the reparenting event provides the covert link. Lower level
processes cannot recieve any information from a higher level process - even
a notice of termination.
It is easier to verify that such leaks do not occur by permitting only the
process group leader, with no children, to change security levels.
Once elevated, they cannot be dropped - the process must terminate, causing
a logout.
Note: a system running PRIV-SU enables superuser operation, and all bets
on real security disappear.
