Jeez.  Crappity, crappity, crap.  Embarrassing mistake of the year.
I managed to convince myself that the cable couldn't possibly be
responsible, because we got corruption even when using UDMA-33 (which
protects from cable faults).  Somewhere in my logic I obviously lost the
plot, and forgot that I switched DMA off *before* seeing corruption.
Sigh.  Ah, I think I see a nice brown bag, in a nice deep hole.
Thank you for gently pointing out the error of my ways ;-)
