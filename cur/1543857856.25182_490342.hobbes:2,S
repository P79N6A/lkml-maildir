I think we should aim to have as many subsystems ready to go as possible -
ideally all of them.  Right now we can potentially run userspace before
AIO, posix-timers, message-queues, BIO, networking, etc are ready to run.
It looks to be pretty easy to fix...

I don't know in this case - but firmware loading from a statically-linked
driver is a legit thing to do.

Judging by the comment there, the only reason we prepare the rootfs prior
to running initcalls is for firmware.  So the sequence
	run initcalls
	populate rootfs
	run initcalls which want to access files
fixes everything?
