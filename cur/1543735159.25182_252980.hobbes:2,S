How do you cover those HighMem pages that get marked Reserved and are
unusable? (That's what the e820 logic was for, iirc. Think it was done
about February!). Not handling them resulted in MCEs when trying to do
the atomic copy or when restoring (seemed random).

Mmm. I should get around to using pfn_to_page. That's necessary for
discontig support, right? Haven't looked at that yet. (Yes, swsusp has
functionality suspend2 doesn't!) :>.

Wow. This function is really hard to understand. Or maybe I'm really
ignorant :>.
