Fine, that's your option.  I'm not forcing you to use udev, yet :)

No that is not what sysfs is about at all.  sysfs exports the internal
device tree that the kernel knows so that userspace can use this
information for all sorts of different things (proper power management,
etc.)  Please go read all of the sysfs and driver model documentation
(and OLS and linux.conf.au papers) for more details about what sysfs and
the driver core is all about.
And claiming udev as "a sort of ugly-hack devfsd" is pretty harsh.
Given that udev uses a documented, open interface, and easily allows
_any_ program to run from it, no matter what the language.  Try reading
the devfsd code some time, or getting it to run your perl script to name
a single type of device :)
Anyway, I'm done with this devfs vs. udev arguments that in the end go
nowhere.  See that document for my position.
If you like devfs, fine, use it.  If you don't, take a look at udev.
And if you like neither, then either create your own solution, or don't
use either.
thanks,
