Hi.
What is the policy as regards linux framebuffer drivers when presented
with a mode they cannot handle.
eg, suppose a driver can only handle even numbers of pixels and a
request is made for a mode with 639 pixels - should it allocate a 640
pixel wide mode?
or should it extend the height of a mode to allow hardware scrolling in
multiples of the font height?
Thanks.
