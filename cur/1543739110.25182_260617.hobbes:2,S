The interrupt priority range probably needs to be increased to accommodate the

Crank it higher 120hz and see what kind of jitter your getting. Hit
something with high memory load, large, mmap images, swap and friends.

That's an RT app slippery slope and it should be handled by some kind of
in-kernel or kernel locking aware facilties. The reason why Linux is
ideal for RTOS usage is directly related to all of the SMP work that's
been done over the years. Contention, therefore the need for priority
inheritance, is evil. If you need that kind of functionality, then you
might be good to consider the scheduling indeterminancy of the lock chain
being aquired and it should have little or no overlap with things like
irq-threads. The system should be decoupled (queues, etc...) if possible
and you shouldn't abuse priority inheritance. The use of priority
inheritance should be considered a kind lock contention overload and
the algorithms it bounds should be optimized. In your case, the network
stack might need to be broken up to provide  the kind of granularity
and control need to attach on a socket per process/thread basis, just
like Jeffery Hsu's lockless network stack effort in DragonFly BSD.
Long priority inheritance chains is an app-level indeterminacy nightmare
and either indicates an improperly written application or nasty SMP
contention issue. That's how I see it.
