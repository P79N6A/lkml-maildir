Adding up the memory all my processes are using, accounts for 31.5% of my
memory (from ps).
However top reports
Mem:  128180K av, 125108K used,   3072K free,  21568K shrd,   3432K buff
Swap: 136544K av,  36836K used,  99708K free                 15156K cached
This just isn't adding up...  Since it doesn't appear to be something
userland eating memory, is it possible there's a kernel mem leak?
I haven't got time to chase this further myself ATM, but if anyone wants
to ask questions, feel free.
Ta,
Ben.
