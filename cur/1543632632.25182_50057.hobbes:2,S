I have been honing a set of procmail rules,
but it's a fine balance between thorough
checks and excessive slowdown of the
mail thoughput -
Anybody used spam assasin for a domain
handling say a few million messages and
a few hundred GB of mail every month,
to say 12,000 users?
I'm looking for a  good tradeoff between
fairly good spam rejection, and keeping
the "fast path" from bogging down  -
Will I just have to bite the bullet and use
a pair of quad CPU monsters for mail
to get good throughput?
