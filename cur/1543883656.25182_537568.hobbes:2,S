Unfortunately, the runs generate different X points - I'm going to try 
and get a second run with the same X-points, and then I can compare 
iostat results (these are being collected).
I do have some iostat data from these runs, and I am trying to make 
sense of them. But, with only about a 0.5% difference in performance, 
and different X values, not much can be gleaned. We'll see when the 
second run of a kernel can be done, and I'll get back to you on that.
