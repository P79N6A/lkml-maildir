Do you want to enable PCI multithreaded probing using your patch?  I
don't think the world is ready for pci multithreaded probing as was
determined by the zillion of bug reports from people who like to enable
config options that state in big letters, "THIS WILL BREAK YOUR BOX"...
And I'm still questioning if we should add your patch at all, as I don't
think any other subsystems need it.  Do you?
thanks,
