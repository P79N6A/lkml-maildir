Hi,
when using Linux 2.1.132-ac3 (sorry, I cannot compile 2.2.0pre1 yet, I
need to obtain some patches first) with matrox acceleration for the
G-200 enabled, everything seems fine until X and kdm start, which
results in the lower third of the screen blanked, nicely on a line
boarder as if it was intended to be only 700 or 800 lines tall, but it
seems to work. X is fine without matrox acceleration. Now, whose fault
is it? Is the matrox G100/200 acceleration driver messing in an
improper way or does XFree86 lack some initialisation. 
Matrox Millennium G-200 AGP w/ 8 MB SDRAM
VIA MVP3 board (Tyan Trinity S1590B)
XF86 SVGA server 3.3.3 (binary libc5 copy from XFree86 mirror)
If you need further information, please tell me what and how to obtain
it.
