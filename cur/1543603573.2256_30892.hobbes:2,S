I agree with this. All I was trying to show is that srand(1) makes it ONE 
VERY PARTICULAR LOAD. Optimizing for this load doesn't make sense at all 
because it is so particular. Optimizing for lower average make more sense. 
That is what you would call TYPE of load. And the average is reproducible 
statistically.

Again, the averages and deviations are reproducible for each particular VM 
algorithm, and provide a good comparison on this type of load. They are 
the fruits.
Speaking of deviations, I was very surprised to see such a significant 
deviation. I think we want it to be smaller. That is what we would call 
predictability of a VM scheme. We need this quality, e.g. for predicting 
the imminent OOM when possible. It would be interesting to compare these 
too for Rik's and Andrea's schemes.
Lastly, I think this sort of simple tests can be adjusted to mimic some 
certain interesting loads by cooking non-random sequences. This is 
different from srand(1), because those sequences can make sense. That's 
were the test becomes deterministic rather than statistical, and qsort() 
becomes irrelevant too.
