Hi All
I have some questions regarding sys_clone. I want to create a thread of the
current running process from the kernel. Looking at the source code, it is
possible to do it by calling do_fork. I just was confused about the values I
need to set pt_regs *regs parameter. Does any body know a description of how
to set it?
My second question can I create new thread of a process is not currently
running. Looking at copy_process function it only copy the process which is
currently running "it copy the current pointer"?
Thanks
Mohamed
