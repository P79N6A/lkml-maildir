Hi everybody - Happy New Year to you all!
OK, updated to git rc7 yesterday - I now see this in syslog:
   "Driver 'sd' needs updating - please use bus_type methods"
The warning never appeared in RC6, and all google reveals are other
peoples logs that are posted about other issues.
Do I need to fix up something here?
Thanks,
Nick
