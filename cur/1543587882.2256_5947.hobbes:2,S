I don't see the problem.  shmem_getpage_locked appears to back off
correctly if it encounters a swap-cached page already existing if
swapin_readahead has installed the page first, at least with the code
in 2.4.3-ac5.
There *does* appear to be a race, but it's swapin_readahead racing
with shmem_writepage.  That code does not search for an existing entry
in the swap cache when it decides to move a shmem page to swap, so we
can install the page twice and end up doing a lookup on the wrong
physical page if there is swap readahead going on.
To fix that, shmem_writepage needs to do a swap cache lookup and lock
before installing the new page --- it should probably just copy the
new page into the old one if it finds one already there.
