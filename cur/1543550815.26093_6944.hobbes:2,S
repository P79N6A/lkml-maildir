Unless you have a special bay that tri-states the buss or a host that does
it for the requested channel (yes that disables both devices) you can do
this once per mainboard.
There was a proposal for tri-stating the buss, but that was held for 2.5.
There is a partial reset IOCTL in 2.4, but it needs more additions to
recover the drive state.
Regardless, it can/has/currently can be done, just the general kernels can
not do it yet.
There is a cool card by Iwill that is HPT368 based that does this nicely.
You stoke the card the right way and the drive power goes away, then
stroke it a different way to tri-state the channel...etc
Pull ribbon first then power connector and change drives.
Reconnect power first to set interface to tri-state (obviously the gound
lines define the state) then the ribbon, stroke channel active, then
stroke the power.
Init device rescan (missing), revalidation (present), etc ..
Forgot the rest but it is written somewhere in the cave.
