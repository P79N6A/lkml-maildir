I've looked at the 2.4.14 nfs fs code as it seemed client side.
         /* We place the length at the beginning of the page,
          * in host byte order, followed by the string.  The
          * XDR response verification will NULL terminate it.
          */
I'm guessing nfs3xdr.c does not have this behaviour the code relies on.  I 
will grab 2.4.17 and see of the code/behaviour is different.
