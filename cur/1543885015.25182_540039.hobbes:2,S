Yep, suits me.  I'm happy for the code to assume that at least %cs and
%ds are sane; I guess %ss too.  We could copy %ds into %[efg]s if we
want to be sure (since I could imagine a bootloader leaving them in a
less defined state).
But if the gdt could be missing altogether, then, yes, we should not
touch them at all.
