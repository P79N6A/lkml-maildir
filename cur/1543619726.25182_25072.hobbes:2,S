The only kernels you are likely to see that not happen on are
-	The 2.4.9 kernel with Rik's patches that Linus didnt take
	(Red Hat 2.4.9-*)
-	2.4.17/18pre with the rmap11/rmap12 patches
-	2.4.17/18pre with the -aa patched VM
	(which I believe is also in the SuSE kernel packages)
-	2.2
The base VM in Linus tree has been broken since before 2.4.0 and while
somewhat better is still that - broken. The major vendors don't ship it for
a reason.
