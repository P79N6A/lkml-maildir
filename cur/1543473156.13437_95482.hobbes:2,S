I'm running an 8.4G IBM 16GP model here in 3 partitions and it's working
fine os far (well i haven't noticed any corruptions like you say.. i've
run 2.1.128 and 2.1.132ac2 on it both worked fine.
Is yours a Deskstar 16GP or a Deskstar 8?  I had a friend who's Deskstar
8 had corruption problems so he took it back.
