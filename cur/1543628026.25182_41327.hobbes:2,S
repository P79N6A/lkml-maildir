Another related hack is to modify latency of this northbridge to 0 and
to increase latency of "bandwidth eating" components. On
french-speaking newsgroup fr.comp.os.linux.moderated, we have several
reports that complete freeze of the system with TV cards can be
postponed (at least ; in my case, they disappeared) by this
tweak. Since, this is TV card related, I have already submitted this
to bttv maintainer (I haven't checked if latest revisions of bttv
include an option for this) but maybe decreasing to 0 the northbridge
latency could help some people too (with or without TV card).
