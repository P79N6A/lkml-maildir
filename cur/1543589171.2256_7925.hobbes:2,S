I consider it a corner case. There isn't really an alternative.
Firstly, it would be really messy to magically change the output of
/proc/partitions depending on whether devfs was mounted. Secondly,
just because it's mounted doesn't mean it's mounted on /dev, so it's
still easy to get wrong.

If you want a really robust solution, have your tool scan
/proc/filesystems and see if devfs is available. If not, scan
/proc/partitions. If devfs is available, then create a temporary mount
point and mount it there, then scan $mntpoint/discs.
