If the E820 returns the memory addresses and if they happen to be
in increasing order without an overlap, this should be quite sufficient
to make sure if the call is correctly supported (not broken). But doing
this can be quite a problem and would add unnecessary code.
If we were talking of having any options disabled by default, then I
guess it should be the E801 call (considering the frequency of errors
of E820 and E801).
