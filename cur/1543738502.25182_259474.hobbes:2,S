Assuming the device driver(s) you pick are happy with 64 bit sector
numbers, you should expect this to work (iow, you should not have
any trouble from XFS itself).  SGI ships 2.4 product with specific
supported drivers and the LBD patch (both 32 and 64 bit boxen) in
order to use large devices.
cheers.
