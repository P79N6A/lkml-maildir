Firstly, having both causes confusion.  As a prime example of this,
see the PCIE crap - they implement both the bus_type suspend/resume
methods _and_ the device_driver suspend/resume methods, despite these
device_driver suspend/resume methods never ever being called.
Secondly, keeping both negates the _whole_ point of this series and
the previous platform device driver series - needless bloat:
- the extra bloat in struct device_driver for all bus types,
  many of which do not have things like shutdown or suspend/resume
  callbacks.
- the extra code bloat in many drivers to convert the struct device
  to something more bus specific.
Also, don't you think it's wrong to keep these fields _just_ to
support single case that SCSI wants to remain using the Old Way,
when everything else can be (and almost has been) converted to the
New Way?
