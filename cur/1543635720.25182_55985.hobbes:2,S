Wis you ever look at the cdrecord sources?
Cdrecord relies on libscg which is a generic SCSI transport library.
It has been first written in August 1986 when I wrote the first SCSI
pass through driver (for SunOS-3.0) - long before Adapted came out with
ASPI. In the 16 years of evolution, it has been ported to > 30
different platforms (not including CPU variants like sparc/x86).
If you force cdrecord to rely on CD-ROM only interfaces, you make Linux
unusable in general. Do you really like to create an unusable Linux just
to avoid creating a usable generic SCSI transport interface?
