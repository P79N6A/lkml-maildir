Either.  The smallest as actually 2.75T (typo above).
Precisely it was
  2929641472  kilobytes
or 
  5859282944 sectors
or 
  0x15D3D9000 sectors.
So it is over 32bits already...
Uhm, I just noticed something.
'chunk' is unsigned long, and when it gets shifted up, we might lose
bits.  That could still happen with the 4*2.75T arrangement, but is
much more likely in the 2*5.5T arrangement.
Jeff, can you try this patch?
Thanks.
