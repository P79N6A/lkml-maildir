There will be a problem when both the tools (built on top of kprobes) try
to place probes at the same address: only the first probe actually succeds,
the second one gets -EEXIST from register_kprobe.
This could be made to work, but at the moment, it seems unnecessary 
complication to me. Lets reconsider it when it really becomes a problem.
Thanks,
Vamsi.
