Can we please add the following two to the list of known regressions:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7082
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7207
They are regressions with respect to 2.6.17.x kernels, but still.
In both cases the commits that cause or trigger the problem have been
identified.  Moreover in the first case everyone involved seems to agree that
the commit should be reverted (at least temporarily).
Greetings,
Rafael
