The only real secure way of handling such devices are with full kernel
drivers or at least kernel drivers that do proper sanity checking. 
However, since 3Dfx won't release anything but the binary-only Glide
libs, we've got only the two choices.  Both ways of using Glide
introduce security risks.  Suid-root however has a larger set of
security risks that are more easily exploitable.
We've been through this argument before with the X/fbcon/svgalib/KGI
deal.  Control of graphics hardware, like all other hardware, is the
domain of the kernel.  Needing root privileges to access hardware is a
bad situation no matter how you look at it.

OpenGL is truly the way to go, but the X server shouldn't have to get
involved.  It just adds more overhead to a usually speed demanding
operation.  OpenGL vs. Glide hasn't been much of an issue up until now
since 3Dfx was the only hardware that had _any_ support under Linux. 
Now that the Matrox G200 specs are out there will finally be more
supported cards and OpenGL will gain acceptance.  However, until 3Dfx
releases info, you still need Glide, even to use Mesa, which means
user-space access to the hardware.
