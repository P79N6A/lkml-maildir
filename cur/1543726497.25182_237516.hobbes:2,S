Hmmm ...
As is often the case, Andrew knows more than he lets on.
OGAWA,
I cannot post a latest patch.  I do not know enough to do so.
I attempted some code readability comments, but probably I should not
have, since I don't have the knowledge of this code that I should have
in order to test it, nor to know by reading it what works.
You replied, a couple of messages ago, with entirely sensible comments
to my posting.  Since then, I have been doing my best to remove myself
from this thread.
Unless you have something else you wish to propose, please tell Andrew
to go with your patch, which (just to avoid confusion) I copy again
below.
Your patch satisfies me just fine now.
Please let Andrew know if he should take it.
My apologies for making a confusion of this.
Thank-you for your good work and your patience.
[PATCH] Fix NR_KEYS off-by-one error
KDGKBENT ioctl can use 256 entries (0-255), but it was defined as
key_map[NR_KEYS] (NR_KEYS == 255). The code seems also thinking it's 256.
	key_map[0] = U(K_ALLOCATED);
	for (j = 1; j < NR_KEYS; j++)
		key_map[j] = U(K_HOLE);
