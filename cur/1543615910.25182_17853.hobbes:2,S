The system load goes up by one for each process which is stuck on
a semaphore.  You have lots of processes stuck on a semaphore because
a process took an oops with a semaphore held, and killed itself
without releasing the semaphore.

We appear to not have the faulting address.  And because klogd attempted
to interpret the oops, we don't have the instruction decode which would
allow us to work out the faulting address.
Please.  edit /etc/rc.d/init.f/syslog (or equivalent) and ensure that
klogd is launched with the `-x' option:
        daemon klogd -x $KLOGD_OPTIONS
Once this is done, your logs will be ksymoops-friendly.
So.  Why did it oops?  Don't know.  The buffercache hashtable has
become corrupted.  Could be bad memory, could be some part of the
kernel (any part) scribbled on memory.  And the latter is one of
the very hardest bugs to find.
