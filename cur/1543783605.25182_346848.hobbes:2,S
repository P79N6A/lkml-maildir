I realize this completely.  The point of moving to kabi/* and kcore/*
would be to remove the dependence of userspace-accessible headers on
kernel-internal stuff.  As I see it, part of that means exporting a
reasonably clean and straightforward API from kabi/kcore, including a
decent namespace prefix.  The goal would be something that the kernel
headers could map to types useable in kernel code, that various *libc
in userspace could map to POSIX types, and that would have a nice
prefix to be namespace clean and avoid the risk of contamination.
Given this set of goals, I think that something like the below would
probably work and satisfy the needs of both *libc and the kernel:
/* kcore/types.h */
typedef unsigned char __kabi_u8;
typedef   signed char __kabi_s8;
typedef [...]
/* linux/types.h */
#include <kcore/types.h>
#ifndef __KERNEL__
# warning "Insert some kind of deprecation warning here
#endif
   /* These for compatibility only.  When the last ABI headers move
      to kcore or kabi, these should go in __KERNEL__ */
typedef __kabi_u8 __u8;
typedef __kabi_s8 __s8;
[...]
#ifdef __KERNEL__
typedef __kabi_u8 u8;
typedef __kabi_s8 s8;
#endif
/* stdint.h */
#include <kcore/types.h>
typedef __kabi_u8 uint8_t;
typedef __kabi_s8 int8_t;
[...]
Cheers,

There is no way to make Linux robust with unreliable memory subsystems,
sorry.  It would be like trying to make a human more robust with an
unreliable O2 supply. Memory just has to work.
