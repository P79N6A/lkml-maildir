Fortunately, rmap and non-rmap will fork at the same speed since in
each case the work will consist of copying just the page directory and
incrementing the use counts of up to 1024 page tables.
Page table instantiation, which happens at fault time, will be slower
for rmap than non-rmap.  However there are offsetting factors that
suggest the bottom line performance will be very similar in unloaded
cases, and will favor rmap under heavy load.
