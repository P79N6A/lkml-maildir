Hello everybody,
I'm currently working with Linux on a custom ASIC system with two 
crappy UART ports that show a behaviour quite similar to the problem 
that the UART_BUG_TXEN workaround is supposed to deal with. The 
interesting lines are in serial8250_start_tx 
(drivers/serial/8250.c:1127)
	if (up->bugs & UART_BUG_TXEN) {
		unsigned char lsr, iir;
		lsr = serial_in(up, UART_LSR);
		iir = serial_in(up, UART_IIR);
		if (lsr & UART_LSR_TEMT && iir & UART_IIR_NO_INT)
			transmit_chars(up);
	}
Correct me if I'm mistaken, but I see two possible race conditions with 
that piece of code:
1. What if the IIR actually equals UART_IIR_THRI at that point? The
    read access will clear the interrupt condition and the workaround
    will effect the actual opposite of its intention: Neither
    serial8250_start_tx() nor the interrupt handler will start
    transmitting characters for the ring buffer.
2. What if an interrupt is triggered shortly after reading the IIR?
    Both serial8250_start_tx() and the interrupt handler will start
    a transmission simultaneously.
Problem #1 should be quite easy to deal with: If the IIR read comes out 
as UART_IIR_THRI then the interrupt handler won't initiate a 
transmission, so we should. I'm not entirely sure how to deal with #2, 
though. Maybe it's enough to clear the THRE bit while transmitting 
characters, maybe some kind of locking is required.
Cheers,
Ingo
