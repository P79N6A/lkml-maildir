Yeah, IMHO it's not really worth optimizing for the obscure and oddly- 
defined cases unless you can actually find valid places where that  
code comes up understandably.  In this particular case, the Coverity  
checker is indirectly pointing out that the code is confusing to the  
reader and could inadvertently be massively broken by changing the  
type of d_name.
