I recall speculation that the clocks aren't necessarily at the same
frequency, and aren't locked to each other.
When clocked aren't locked together, guaranteeing global ordering based
on timestamps becomes, how shall I say, an "interesting" problem :-)
You don't have an SMP Alpha _yet_, but you might as well solve this
difficult problem once and for all.  Then you'll be the obvious person
to receive an SMP Alpha for testing :-)
