I am not so sure. :)
Btw, the new VM and elevator have been very long to stabilize. Such

me. I would also suspect some flaws in these parts, too.

It is probably time to rewrite this old code. Good luck for that.

That's the wish. Just crossing finger for things to work a lot better than
the development of your new VM and elevator improvements. :-)
