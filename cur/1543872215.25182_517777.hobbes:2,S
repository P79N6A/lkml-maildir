Please don't put non-kernel software in /pub/linux/kernel and 
/pub/scm/linux/kernel on kernel.org.
IN PARTICULAR, if Josh is the new sparse maintainer, please contact 
ftpadmin@kernel.org so we can either create a group or simply chown the 
standard locations (/pub/software/devel/sparse, /pub/scm/devel/sparse) 
to him instead of leaving stale stuff where people can find it!
