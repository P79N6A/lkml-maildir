It wasn't really lying to you. The issue is that the kernel samples at
regular intervals to avoid timer reprogramming overhead. Now top(1) is
isochronous in nature as it's trying to periodically refresh, and so
it runs in lockstep with the clock interrupt, and the kernel hands back
bad numbers to top(1).
