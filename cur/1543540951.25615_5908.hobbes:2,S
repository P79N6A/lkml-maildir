Hi Mark,
What about small (36 byte) things like fs_struct - looks like it is the
only one left as kmalloc'd still - is there any point to convert it to a
cache of its own - fs_cachep?
I understand it will come from 64 byte generic cache so perhaps it is just
as wasteful? Or do you (SLAB) store some useful ctl info in those
remaining bytes?
Regards,
Tigran
