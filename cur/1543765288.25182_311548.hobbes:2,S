Maybe -- if we are prepared to propagate the BK myth that network
bandwidth and disk space are free. 
Meanwhile, in the real world, it'd be really useful to support sharing.
I'd even like to see support for using multiple branches checked out of
the same .git/ repository. We already cope with having multiple branches
_in_ the repository -- all we need to do is cope with multiple indices
too, so we can have different versions checked out.
