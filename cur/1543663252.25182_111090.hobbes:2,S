That's correct.
But there is still no issue.
The user can make his machine non-RFC compliant by giving a bogus
specification to setkey.  Kernel and setkey are merely doing what
the user asks of them.
This is akin to the user writing a RAW socket application which makes
the kernel output non-RFC compliant TCP packets.  Do you suggest that
the kernel or some other part of the system should verify the packets
sent through the RAW socket interface?  That is exactly what you are
telling us that setkey should be doing.
