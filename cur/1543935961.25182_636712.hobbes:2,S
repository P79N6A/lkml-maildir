I don't quite get how the dm version is reinventing things.  They use
the dmsetup command that they use for everything else and provide a
small and fairly clean module for bio specific loop instead of piling
it onto loop.c....
Their code doesn't have the fancy hole handling that yours does, but
neither did yours 4 days ago ;)

It is a natural fit in either place, as both loop and dm have a good
infrastructure for it.  I'm not picky about where it ends up, but dm
wouldn't be a bad place.
