You mentioned CONFIG_NUM_RECLAIM_THREADS_PER_CPU and not
CONFIG_NUM_RECLAIM_THREADS_PER_NODE. The advantage with syscalls is that even if
we get the thing wrong, the system administrator has an alternative. Please look
through the existing sysctl's and you'll see what I mean. What is wrong with
providing the flexibility that comes with sysctl? We cannot possibly think of
all situations and come up with the right answer for a heuristic. Why not come
up with a default and let everyone use what works for them?
