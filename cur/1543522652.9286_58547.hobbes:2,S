Hi James,
Thanks for your comments.
There is a bug in this piece of code:
        /* OK, now copy the revents fields back to user space. */
-       fds1 = fds;
-       for(i=0; i < (int)nfds; i++, ufds++, fds1++) {
-               __put_user(fds1->revents, &ufds->revents);
-       }
+       u = ufds;
+       for(i=0; i < nchunks; i++, u += (i<<POLL_PER_CHUNK_BITS))
+               for (j=0; j < POLL_PER_CHUNK; j++)
+                       __put_user((fds[i] + j)->revents, &u->revents);
+       u += (nchunks<<POLL_PER_CHUNK_BITS);
+       if (nleft)
+               for (j=0; j < nleft; j++)
+                       __put_user((fds[nchunks] + j)->revents,
&u->revents);
can you spot it? I must be blind but I can't spot it immediately and it
breaks rsh :( (because the wrong revents is copied, shifted by one)
I can't spend any time debugging it at work so it will have to wait until
evening...
Regards,
Tigran.
