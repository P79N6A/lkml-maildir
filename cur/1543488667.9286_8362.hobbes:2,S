Hi Everybody,
 This is to announce that DIPC (Distributed Inter-process Communication) 
test version 1.1b is now available for downloading. This package patches 
Linux kernel 2.2.1.
 DIPC can be used to create clusters (multi-computers) of Linux machines. 
It works by making System V IPC mechanisms (Shared Memories, Semaphores 
and Messages) work over a network. DIPC provides (among other things) 
Transparent Distributed Shared Memory (TDSM). This means that processes can 
read and write to a shared memory with no need for any synchronization. 
 The package (dipc-1.1b.tgz), which includes the sources and documentation, 
can be downloaded from DIPC's web pages at 
http://wallybox.cei.net/dipc
  
or from 
ftp://wallybox.cei.net/pub/dipc.
 Please send any questions or problems to linux-dipc@wallybox.cei.net
