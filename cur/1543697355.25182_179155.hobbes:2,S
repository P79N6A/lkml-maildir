I reported a similar bug twice on the JS list and got no reply.
The drivers for analog joysticks are f*cked up in the 2.6.0 series,
and the maintainers don't care. I've given up and bought a USB
joystick.

I didn't have your device node problems, but the analog driver
didn't recognize the hat switch any more. It was a Saitek X8-30
"Analog 3-axis 4-button 1-hat CHF joystick" that worked flawlessly
before (with kernels 2.4.*). Eventually a timing problem. There
weren't much changes in the analog/ns558 modules during 2.5.
Tried to fix it, to no avail.
