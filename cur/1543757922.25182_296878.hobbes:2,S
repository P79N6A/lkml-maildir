IIRC last time I really tested this a few months ago, the worst case
latency on that machine was about 150us.  Currently its 422us from the
same clear_page_range code path.
On my Athlon XP the clear_page_range latency is not showing up at all,
and the worst delay so far is only 35us, most of which is the timer
interrupt IOW that machine is showing the best achievable latency (with
PREEMPT_DESKTOP).  The machine seeing 422 us latencies in
clear_page_range is a 600Mhz C3, which is known to be a FSB limited
architecture.
