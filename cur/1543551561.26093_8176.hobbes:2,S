Another idea: What about making it an netfilter thing? 
I'm thinking about a possibility to say the kernel 'if this and that 
netfilter rule matches, delete the ECN bits'. ECN handles routes 
which drop ECN bits, it just looks as if the remote end doesn't know
about ECN.
That way, if you have a network of ECN capable machines, you don't need
to configure the broken links on every single computer, but can do it
on the router/firewall to your network.
