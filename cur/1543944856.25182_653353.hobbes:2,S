I rebooted back into 2.6.24.2 again, and everything works now, without
even upgrading nfs-utils (although I did that anyway, to nfs-utils git
head, and it's still happy).
Linux: debugs itself, no human intervention required! :)
(The inconsistency of this screams `port allocation' to me. If it
happens again I'll get some rpcinfo output and packet dumps. I'd
have done it this time if it hadn't been for the plug-the-security-
hole rush and it being 2am.)
