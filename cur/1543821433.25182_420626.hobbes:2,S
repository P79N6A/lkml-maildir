Maybe I got it wrong, but my impression so far was that
u8 etc. are preferred for kernel code, and C99 types
are merely tolerated. (Mostly for consistency reasons,
I guess, since most old code uses u8 etc.)
However, personally I don't care either way, I just
want to make sure that code written acording to
Documentation/CodingStyle also meets Linus' expectations.
