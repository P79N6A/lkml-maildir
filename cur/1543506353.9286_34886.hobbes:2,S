The thing is, that this is exactly what ERR_PTR and friends are there for,
and they do it RIGHT instead of just making assumptions about things. So
use them - they actually result in readable code when done right, as shown
by the dcache usage, and they do not have any gray areas.
Yes, right now "(void *) (~0UL)" would work fine. It probably will
forever. But you might as well use ERR_PTR(-1) which does the same thing,
is more readable, and is _guaranteed_ to work forever simply because it
can be changed without breaking existing sources when some new
architecture comes along.
