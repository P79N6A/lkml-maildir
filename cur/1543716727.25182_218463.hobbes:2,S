Please also consider allowing everyone to read the ring buffer size.
This way dmesg will continue to behave the same for users and root when
they read the log buffer. (And other options will continue to be denied
to the user.)
Please note that users are already allowed to read the ring buffer (case
3).
Short security analysis:
There is no dynamic information provided. So system behaviour cannot be
infered from reading the ring buffer size.
The information provided can already be infered from the architecture and
release of the distribution. And there are other methods as well.
