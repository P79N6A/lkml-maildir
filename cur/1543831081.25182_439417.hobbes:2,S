The relations are more complicated than just the change of name,
but yes, OpenVZ represents the result of our work for a few years.

I'd like to clarify you idea: whether this host-side device is a real
device capable of receiving and transmitting packets (by moving them between
namespaces), or it's a fake device creating only a view of other namespace's
devices?

"Host(master)-guest" relations is a valid and useful scheme.
However, I'm thinking about broader application of network namespaces,
when they can form an arbitrary tree and may not be in "host-guest" relations.

What do you mean under pass through device?
Do you mean using guest1-tun0 as a backdoor to talk to the guest?

I'm not sure, it's complicated.
You wouldn't want automatic local routes to be added for IP addresses on
the host-side interfaces, right?
Do you expect these IP addresses to act as local addresses in other places,
like answering to arp requests about these IP on all physical devices?
But anyway, you'll have conflicts on the application level.
Many programs like ntpd, bind, and others fetch the device list using the
same ioctls as ifconfig, and make (un)intelligent decisions basing on what
they see.
Mirroring may have some advantages if I am both host and guest administrator.
But if I create a namespace for my friend Joe to play with IPv6 and sit
tunnels, why should I face inconveniences because of what he does there?
Best regards
Andrey
