This was a problem a while back with a bad check fixed by this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test3/2.6.0-test3-mm2/broken-out/4g4g-do_page_fault-cleanup.patch
I can't seem to find that it slipped back in anywhere but the problem
sounds identical (minus an error message about invalid kernel-mode
pagefault before).
