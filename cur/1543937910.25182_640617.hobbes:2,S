That's what __attribute__ ((pure)) is for, but if none of the
functions is pure, the compiler can not be sure about side effects
and can not reorder things. Don't forget that functions can do
anything apart from mangling with their arguments.
And allocator/deallocator functions never can be pure, they must
change global data, the pool of free blocks.
