it`s pretty useful because it`s and a damn fast and damn cpu friendly compression alorithm.
afaik, there is already a least one linux kernel-feature (under development) which is using lzo compression: 
see compressed caching project at 
http://linux-mm.org/CompressedCaching
 & 
http://linuxcompressed.sourceforge.net/
seems, they have also done porting it to the kernel, so there is probably choice between two implemetations to merge.
>How many buffer overruns are there in it?
i don`t know :) 
but, from a user-perspective,  lzo is really portable and seems to be a rock solid compression scheme.
i`m sucessfully using it for years (lzop utility) and i know projects which compress gigabytes of data every day with lzop.
furthermore, i know of at least 40 software projects using lzo compression, so this should have some level of maturity.
maybe i can add another software integrating lzo compression to the enumeration at 
http://www.lzop.de
 ? ;)

Well that's attractive-looking code.
Why is this needed?  What code plans to use it?
How many buffer overruns are there in it?
