Traditionally page aging would be done on the physical page while
scanning the virtual address space of processes.
Of course, this had (in 2.0) the side effect of down aging a page
from libc.so which wasn't used in 20 processes but was used in the
3 processes that weren't asleep ;)
In the (new, experimental) reverse mapping VM Linux has pointers
from the physical pages back to the virtual mappings to the page
so it can actually get the page aging right.
kind regards,
Rik
