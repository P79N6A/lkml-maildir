Looking over the docs the whole ACPI and IOAPIC mode for these boards
seems very different and quite "magic" compared to the PCI mode which is
merely "odd" in a few places. APIC routing bits are stuffed into strange
chipset specific places which implies the quirks probably shouldn't be
applied in acpi mode.
