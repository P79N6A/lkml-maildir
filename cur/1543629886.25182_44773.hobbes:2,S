i've found the reason: the make's stdin was redirected in /dev/null
(my make is aliased to a program prettifying output).
It still starts to compile immediately after *config, though.
/compile/kb-test-o gmake -f ../kb-test/Makefile-2.5 xconfig
Using ARCH='i386' AS='as' LD='ld' CC='/usr/bin/gcc' CPP='/usr/bin/gcc -E' AR='ar' HOSTAS='as' HOSTLD='gcc' HOSTCC='gcc' HOSTAR='ar'
Generating global Makefile
  phase 1 (find all inputs)
(cd /export/home/riesen-pc0/riesen/compile/kb-test-o/.tmp_config/links/ && /export/home/riesen-pc0/riesen/compile/kb-test-o/scripts/tkparse < config.in-2.5) >> /export/home/riesen-pc0/riesen/compile/kb-test-o/scripts/kconfig.tk
<pressed "Save&Exit" here...>
  phase 2 (convert all Makefile.in files)
  phase 3 (evaluate selections)
  phase 4 (integrity checks, write global makefile)
Starting phase 5 (build) for installable
  CC arch/i386/kernel/setup.o
...
looks like my *config targets aren't like yours and belong to phase5
targets 8)
