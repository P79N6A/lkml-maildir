For sure, this risk remains unless SMI is fine-grained controllable
and you can avoid that cirtical services. It's a compromise between
not using common PC hardware for fast time critical jobs at all and a
small risk to loose hardware when something goes wrong anyway.
And such feature would certainly not be on by default. Even we don't
do this, the user must decide after being warned. I'm not aware of
complaints about damages after years of application in the field.

I was thinking about critical timed operations in userspace that are
not known to any driver ahead of time.
