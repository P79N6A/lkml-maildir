Subject: only ieee1394 from 2.4.20 works for me

In the last year I have been playing with a variety of combinations of 
ieee1394 controllers, machines, external mass storage devices and linux 
kernel versions. So have some friends of mine.
The only version that works for us is the ieee1394 code that was 
included with kernel version 2.4.20.
(I removed drivers/ieee1394 completely, and replaced it with 
drivers/ieee1394 from 2.4.20)
Using that snapshot, we are able to transfer data to disks and video 
from a camcorder just fine, in all combinations we have tested.
Every other kernel version, both older or newer than 2.4.20, is broken. 
We either see random errors, or writing data to disks stalls 
immediately, or daisy chained devices don't work.
I'm currently using the official Fedora core 1 series kernels, patched 
that way, and it works like a charm.
Please consider to use the 2.4.20 ieee1394 snapshot in future 2.4.x 
releases.
Best Regards,
Kai
