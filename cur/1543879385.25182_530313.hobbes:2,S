I'm travelling this week (through Monday) and can't be of much immediate
help on improving the situation or explaining it in great detail.  Last
week before I left home I was deep in some strange debugging and didn't get
a chance to look up.  There will be more of that, but I'll try to make some
timely progress on answering all the backlog of correspondence about utrace
too.
Thanks,
Roland
