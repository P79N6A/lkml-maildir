What happens when one is blessed with a laptop where everything is
sharing an interrupt?

I'm running U10.3 and I'm consistently seeing xruns when Jack clients
start and stop, something I would not see before (I have not tried the
latest V series yet). I have tried changing the priority of IRQ9 and the
scheduler but I still see the xruns. Yesterday I tried enabling
preempt_thresh to a low value but did not see hits when the xruns
occurred. Maybe I'm missing something I need to do...
