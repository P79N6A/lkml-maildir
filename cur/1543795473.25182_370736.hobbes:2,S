You wrote about it on lkml, not linux-usb-devel.  So it might not have 
been noticed by the USB developers.

Looks like the vanilla kernel needs to add suspend/resume methods for
usbfs bindings.  What is that GlobeSpan device?  Are you running a
userspace program that controls it?  If you are, you can try quitting that 
program before suspending.
Also, if you haven't tried it, you might want to apply this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-all-2.6.15-rc2-git3.patch
or whatever is the most current version when you download it.
