Yes.  I've finished converting this sucker and I think I understand what's
going on there.  Reliance on block size being <= 1024 seems to be a
side effect of the implementation - not something fundamental.  I'll
try to feed the stuff you've sent into it and see if it works - new
code shouldn't care about the block size.
