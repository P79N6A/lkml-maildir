I'm highly suspicious of drivers that use the PCI_COMMAND word...
thankfully this seems to be a write only variable in this driver :)

this is not needed; this is never ever supposed to happen..
what is more, you allocated consistent DMA memory, without setting the
consistent DMA mask to anything other than 32 bit... so you'll never
even go outside of the 32 bit region..

no need for the if(), kfree(NULL) is perfectly fine

are you sure this lock doesn't need to be irq safe?

doesn't this want a PCI posting flush?
I'm also a bit sceptical about irq_sem ...

hmm I wonder if this shouldn't be a more generic PCI level quirk, not so
much a driver level quirk...
