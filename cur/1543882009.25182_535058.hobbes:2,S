I think having it inside the lock makes sense:
	mutex_lock()
	idr_pre_get()
	idr_get_new()
	mutex_unlock()
here, if idr_pre_get() succeeded, we know that idr_get_new() will succeed.
otoh:
try_again:
	idr_pre_get()
	mutex_lock()
	if (idr_get_new() == failed) {
		mutex_unlock()
		goto try_again;
	}
	mutex_unlock()
is not nice.
the IDR api is awful.  A little project is to rip out all its internal
locking and to implement caller-provided locking.
Unfortunately the fact that the library allocates memory means that we
might need to do awkward things like radix_tree_preload() to make it
reliable for callers who use spinlocking.
