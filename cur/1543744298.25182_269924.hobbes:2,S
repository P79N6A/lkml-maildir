Er, not quite. Unless they accompany the binary with the complete
machine-readable source code, they're obliged to make the source
available to any third party, not just to the recipient of the binaries.
I assume from the "you ask for it and we don't want to talk to you any
more" that they are not actually including the source with the binaries.
So you just get your friend to ask for the source, and they must give it
to him without stopping _your_ updates.
