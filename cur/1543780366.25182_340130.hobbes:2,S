The problem I had when I tried using just clone() was that it's
not possible to have a pam library clone() and have the process
being authenticated end up with the new namespace.  At least not
that I could figure out.  Seemed possible that cloning, exiting the
original thread, and returning from the new thread could work, but
it didn't seem to work when I tried it.
