How about saying in CONFORMING TO that they only exist(ed) in that range of
kernels, for ia32 and ia64; and adding a DEPRECATED to the title?
And as this was during the current development series, what is the point of
manpages anyway?
Thanks for your efforts! This is certainly much needed work, which isn't
very "sexy".
