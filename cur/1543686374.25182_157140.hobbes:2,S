Several reasons:
- The interaction wasn't understood initially, and some problems
  didn't start appearing until late last year. The problems are
  also system & configuration dependent.
  Case in point #1: my P3B-F and P4T-E ASUS mainboards never had
  problems until they started running 2.5 kernels, where HZ==1000
  greatly increased the likelihood of a local APIC timer interrupt
  while in BIOS screen blanking code.
  Case in point #2: my TUSL2-C ASUS mobo (RIP) worked great until
  I switched from a Millenium to a Radeon 8500, and found that it
  hung because of local APIC timer interrupts while in BIOS screen
  blanking code, even in 2.4 kernels.
- Fixing the APM driver would require that someone who understands
  it modifies it to avoid BIOS calls (other than suspend/resume) when
  UP_APIC is active. I'm not that person.
- The problems can be worked around by avoiding misconfigurations.
