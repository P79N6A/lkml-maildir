A small SMP bug did indeed slip through in 2.4.6 that nails some SMP 
hardware dead cold.  It should be fixed in the -ac tree know.  Have no idea 
about the spontaneous reboots you were seeing with the earlier kernels.

Yup.  If you have the right combination of hardware, in 2.4.6+ you could 
sometimes end up in an infinite loop while holding a spinlock.  I was able 
to hit the jackpot with dual P-IIIs on a 440GX with two aic7xxx HBAs. 
This wouldn't explain your spontaneous reboots, but try booting with 
"noapic".
