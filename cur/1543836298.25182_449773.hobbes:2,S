I don't buy the "safe to allocate runqueues dynamically" bit since they
are local to sched.c and if you do do that (I did for a customer once)
you better know what you're doing.
That said, ...
Hmm, Ingo I guess he's right on the first part:
<sched_init snipit>
		rq->nr_running = 0;
[...]
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
		rq->sd = NULL;
		for (j = 1; j < 3; j++)
			rq->cpu_load[j] = 0;
		rq->active_balance = 0;
		rq->push_cpu = 0;
		rq->migration_thread = NULL;
</sched_init snipit>
So I guess we should add his zero initializer, or we should remove all
the other zero initializers.  Either way, we should be consistent.
