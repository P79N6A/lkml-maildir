i don't have the experience you have with some of this, so this is all a
"humble opinion."

this is probably left over from 2.0, but it might be a good idea to leave
it in for protection against programming errors later on.  based on some
of the things i've been experimenting with, a branch like this is arguably
not too expensive.  i think we should change the error case to panic, or
at least print a message.
or not. :)

agreed.

yes, this will help these buffers get re-used more quickly.  i can imagine
this being useful during a software installation from CD-ROM, for
instance.

i'm thinking that would be hard to implement efficiently.  set_blocksize()
and invalidate_buffers() would have to block getblk() to do this
correctly.  wouldn't that be expensive to add to mainline code?

same as touch_buffer() comment above -- agreed.  naked find_buffer() is
used in lots of places from ext2 and the raid code, isn't it?
