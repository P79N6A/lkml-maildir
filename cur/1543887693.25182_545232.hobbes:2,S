Subject: bug in 2.6.22-rc1: loop devices limited to one single device

Hi,
The patch against loop.c is neither a fix, nor does it create
loop devices on demand:
Facts are instead, at least on my machine:
The number of available loop devices is reduced from 8 (conventional
standard of preceding 2.6 kernels) to 1.
The consequence is: If you have to mount more than one single iso-image with
the loop parameter you are receiving the following message during system boot:
"mount: could not find any free loop device"
Regards
Uwe
