However doing a data integrity test with a pattern buffer
write-verify-read on multi-lun, multi-session, and multiple connections
per session, while issuing load-balancing commands (ie thread tag) over
each session to roast the bandwidth of the line should be enough.
Now toss in injected errors to randomly fail data pdu's and calling a
sync-and-steering layer to scan the header and or data digests to execute
a within connection recovery, regardless if the reason, should be enough
to warm up the beast.
If that is not enough, I can toss in multi-initiators all with the
features above or invoke the interoperablity modes to add the cisco and
ibm initiator (both limited to error recovery level zero, while pyx's is
capable of error recovery level one and part of two).
Please let me know if I need to throttle it harder.
Cheers,
