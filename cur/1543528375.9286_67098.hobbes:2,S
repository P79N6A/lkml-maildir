Update: just built a nice little kernel with about every driver that I
could get to compile (about twenty if them refused, not good :-( ), which
resulted in a bzImage of ~4 MB, a plain binary of ~9.8 MB, and a vmlinux
of ~11.6 MB.
Tried to load it with LILO: loads, uncompressed, says it's booting, and
dies (system reboots after about one second of inactivity). Tried bootimg
on bzImage, vmlinux, and plain binary, and got about the same symptoms in
all three cases.
So yes, something is wrong. It could of course be that the kernel dies an
early death because of some internal conflicts which aren't related to
size. Investigating ...
