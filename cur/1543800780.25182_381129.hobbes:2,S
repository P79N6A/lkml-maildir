And for myself, I think I'm not enough into kernel development already.
Beside of that, USB isn't my very interest but those patches had to be
done to get the new PowerBook models running smooth. Hopefully there's
someone else interested in doing the split because it would be a good
thing.

Does that mean the patch doesn't get into the kernel until the split
happened?
Thanks,
