We've run into a couple of these pieces of highmem that can't be
reclaimed.  The latest one are pages for the new pipe buffers.  We could
code these up with a flag something like __GFP_HIGHMEM_NORCLM, that is
__GFP_HIGHMEM in the normal case, but 0 in the hotplug case (at least
for now).

At least for the large consumers of slab (dentry/inode caches), they
can't quite reclaim on demand.  I was picking Dipankar's brain about
this one day, and there are going to be particularly troublesome
dentries, like "/", that are going to need some serious rethinking to be
able to forcefully free.
