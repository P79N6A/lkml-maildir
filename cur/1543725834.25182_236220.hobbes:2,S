I must say that my gut feeling here is that bolting an arbitrary new
namespace into the kernel in this manner is not the way to proceed.
I hope we'll hear more from Greg on this next week - see if we can come up
with some way to use the kobject/sysfs namespace for this.
Although heaven knows how "tmpfs just ran out of space" would map onto
kobject/sysfs.
