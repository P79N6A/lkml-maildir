Hi Thomas,
I'm sorry, but this patch is all wrong IMHO.
For kdump we have to assume that the kernel is fundamentally broken,
we've panicked, so something bad has happened - every line of kernel
code that is run decreases the chance that we'll successfully make it
into the kdump kernel.
So just calling unregister_driver() is no good, that's going to call
lots of code, try to take lots of locks, rely on lots of data structures
being uncorrupted etc. etc.
And the hijacking of machine_crash_shutdown() is IMO not an acceptable
solution, as you say it only works if EHEA is the only driver to do it.
And as soon as EHEA does it other drivers will want to do it.
What we need is the _minimal_ set of actions that can happen to make
EHEA work in the kdump kernel.
Solutions that might be better:
 a) if there are a finite number of handles and we can predict their 
    values, just delete them all in the kdump kernel before the driver
    loads.
 b) if there are a small & finite number of handles, save their values 
    in a device tree property and have the kdump kernel read them and 
    delete them before the driver loads.
 c) if neither of those work, provide a minimal routine that _only_
    deletes the handles in the crashed kernel.
 d) <something else>
cheers
