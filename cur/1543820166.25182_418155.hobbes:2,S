well, mtd_concat_create() functions doesn't use MTD partitions...and
what's happening if the user needs to use its own partitions based on
a device resulting of several concatenated flashes? It migth be
possible to still use your solution and just fix user partitions but
it really seems easier to fix the MTD size after it the flash has been
probed.
Do you think it's possible to change the size of a mtd device rigth
after probing it ?
Thanks
