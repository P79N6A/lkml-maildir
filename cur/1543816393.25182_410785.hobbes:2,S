I thought usb_scsi taught us that SCSI was overkill for a block
abstraction?  I have a much simpler Xen block-device implementation
which seems to perform OK, and is a lot less LOC than the in-tree one,
so I don't think the "SCSI would be better than what's there" (while
possibly true) is valid.
Cheers!
Rusty.
