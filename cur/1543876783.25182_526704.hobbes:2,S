Hmm... for that to be completely plug-and-play you need to make sure a dhcp 
server on the host exists.
Vmware runs a separate DHCP server exactly for this, even if we should avoid 
that as much as possible.

What about installing and pre-configuring Xnest on the image? With a suitable 
script calling xhost on the host, it just works.
This project did it:
http://umlbuilder.sourceforge.net/
although it stopped working for me ages ago (probably for some UML bug). I 
built a Mandrake image (that I now lost) with Xnest configured. With a script 
on the host which passes the host IP and that calls xhost, it should work 
easily. And btw, we need a standard startup script anyway.

Why not one management UI running from the host, a-la vmware? Possibly, with 
as much code as possible in scripting languages, for better transparency.
