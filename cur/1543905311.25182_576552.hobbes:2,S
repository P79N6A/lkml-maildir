We could do that I suppose, but /proc/<pid of crashing process>/* contains
informatino apport (and other apps need) to help diagnose problems during a
crash.  To provide that information, we would then need to build out
infrastructure to pipe that information in-band through the pipe (perhaps
through ELF notes).  Doable yes, but certainly not a small patch (consider
piping all of the files in /proc/<pid> as ELF notes).
Regarding security, and the use of non-legit programs: If the program pointed to
by core pattern does not exist, then the exec simply fails, and the core is
lost.  Beyond that, core_pattern is only writable by root, and its teh sysadmins
responsibility to ensure that it points to valid and secured program.

you mean like a build time config option? I'm not sure I see lots of value,
although, it seems like it would straightforward enough to do if you feel
strongly about it.
