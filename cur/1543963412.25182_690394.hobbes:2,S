The inode_wait in fs core code(fs/inode.c) is really just_schedule, so
is the gdlm_ast_wait, and they are all fs related code;
But inode_wait is not a better name for its work, instead just_schedule won.
So I should ask for opinions from fs core crew,
BTW, today I did a grep among the whole kernel tree and found that
just_schedule is also useful to other code, such as:
key_wait_bit(security/keys/request_key.c:25)
It's also really a just_schedule.
So just_schedule should go to lib/ ? Or we just append it into kernel/sched.c?
