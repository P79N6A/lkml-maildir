Interesting, now we need to find out if the problem is the allocator in
2.4.14pre5aa1 that fails too early by mistake, or if this is a true oom
condition. I tend to think it's a true oom condition since mainline
deadlocked under the same workload where -aa correctly killed the task.
Can you provide also a 'vmstat 1' trace of the last 20/30 seconds before
the task gets killed?
A true oom condition could be caused by a memleak in mlock or something
like that (or of course it could be a bug in the userspace testcase, but
I checked the testcase a few weeks ago and I didn't found anything wrong
in it).
