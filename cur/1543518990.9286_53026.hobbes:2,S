Subject: [patch] 2.3.31: remove some cruft from module.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This is a simple patch to 2.3.31 to remove some useless cruft
in kernel/module.c  In qm_symbols() there is a call to
access_ok() to check if the user memory is writeable.
But the memory will be written with copy_to_user()
which contains its own call to access_ok()
    copy_to_user()                           //
include/asm-i386/uaccess.h
        __generic_copy_to_user()    // arch/i386/lib/usercopy.c
            access_ok()
Furthermore, this is the only routine in module.c
which has this access_ok() check.
