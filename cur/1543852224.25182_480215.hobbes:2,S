Well, it could return NULL.  Is that a failure?
But, nobody is checking for an outright error, certainly.  Especially
when the error hasn't been ERR_PTR'd.  :)  So I agree, that's not so good.
But, how is a stampede of fs-freezers -supposed- to work?  I could
imagine something like a freezer count, and the filesystem is only
unfrozen after everyone has thawed?  Or should only one freezer be
active at a time... which is what we have now I guess.
