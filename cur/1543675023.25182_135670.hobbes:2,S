we just did an update from 2.4.10-SuSE because of some problems with the
hardware (module for NIC and HDD). In this constellation we also had a
kernel oops with the ISDN ("killing interrupt handler") which unfortunately
didn't give us any hints in the logs.
The systems are a field test and running an application that's why it is a
problem to access them. I think a cause has an effect. The ISDN was not
active at that time but probably a job of the SuSE distri, but I can't
imagine that this causes kernel problems.
 I will run a test in our lab and hope to get the error, then I can do some
changes with the system.
Thanks for your hints...

Well, what exactly do you expect to hear? There are about a million and one
possibilities about your problem. Most of them are hardware-related. Hoping
that you have already made sure that you have no defective RAM, controller,
mainboard or the like (unlikely since you mention two hosts) I would
eliminate
additional risk factors like USB (always gives fun) and use the latest
kernel.

Stephan
