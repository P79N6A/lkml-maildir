Summary of module patches
=========================
Still pending in my patchqueue (I didn't want to swamp Linus).
      Other architectures (ppc, ppc64, sparc, sparc64, ia64)
      Module license support
      Exception table walk cleanup
      Documentation on writing module-compatible interfaces
      Modversions reimplementations (under discussion with Kai)
	- Requires a second pass, but allows mixing of versioned &
	  non-versioned kernels and modules.
Not done yet:
      DEVICE_TABLE support
	- Discussions with gregkh on not exporting the in-kernel
	  datastructure and using module aliases.
      Other archs (alpha, arm, cris, m68k, mips, mips64, parisc, s390,
	    s390x, sh, v850, x86_64)
