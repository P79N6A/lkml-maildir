Looks good.  I wonder if we could find a better name for it.  Maybe just
dec_nlink?  And add a simple counterpart
static inline void inc_nlink(struct inode *inode)
{
	inode->i_nlink++;
}
for symmetry reasons.  After that the patch can go off to Andrew before
the series aswell.

They'll definitly need some auditing.
