Yes. I just noticed that most network board drivers in version 2.4.18
do not execute release_region() after they have done a request_region(),
if they fail to install because of some error. The error in this case was
the failure to allocate memory because I told the kernel I only had 4
megabytes (exprimental ioremap() of the rest in another module).
Is somebody fixing these drivers (do you know).  I could download the
latest of the 2.4.n series and clean some of these up if they have not
already been done by somebody else.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
