Hi all,
I'm finding this mailing list extremely useful. Thanks to all for fast and
(commonly) courteous reponses!
I've switched from 2.2.10-ac1 to 2.0.37 on some of my dual-P2 machines for
stability reasons. Is there some patch for 2.0.37 to make the SMP more
"efficient"? There's no reason for me to live on the bleeding-crashing-edge
with 2.2.10 but I do hear that SMP is more "efficient".
