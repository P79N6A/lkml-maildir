Peter reverted the load balance patch and 2.6.25-rc4 accepted the reverting patch.
With kernel 2.6.25-rc5, volanoMark has about 6% regression on my 16-core tigerton. If I apply
patch 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/20/83
 which fixes the tbench regression issue, volanoMark
regression becomes about 4%.
I tried to bisect down which patch caused the last 4%, but found it's very hard. One thing
is many patches depend on the reverted patches. The other thing is I find the testing result
isn't stable since 2.6.25-rc1. The result variation might be more than 15% sometimes. I ran the
testing against the same kernel for many times to get the best result.
I also tried to tune some sched_XXX parameters under /proc/sys/kernel, but didn't get better result
than the default configuration.
Above regression exists on the 2.93GHz 16-core tigerton. With the less powerful 2.40GHz 16-core
tigerton, the regression is less than 1%, but result is not stable and results of many runs might have
about 15% variation.
On 8-core stoakley, the regression is about 1%.
Sorry for the late update.
