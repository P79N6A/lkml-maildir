I'd really like 'bk send' to drop me to a shell/mailer like and
ask for confirmation before sending the mail (and eventually add
for example the cc: line to l-k).
What I found easier to use is to 'bk send - > /tmp/foo' then send 
foo using my regular mailer... But I lose the advantages of
checking the last sended ChangeSet (in Bitkeeper/etc/send-a@b.com).
Stelian.
