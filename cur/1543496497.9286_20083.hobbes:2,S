Well, I was calling it from within an other kernel_thread, so this should
be safe. After some digging in the kmod-code I found that they used the
syscall "waitpid" to do this, and after some directed trial-and-error I
was able to get "waitpid" to recognise and clean-up the children.
Kernel-mode httpd just couldn't work long without this :-)
