Hi Guys;
I am a newcomer for Linux world. I used largely pSOS and a little bit
WinCE. I tried to find some sort of documents about Kernel structure,
linux directory structure and dependency of source files in Linux. 
I am interested in Embedded Linux due to some resource restrictions.
All I found from web so far, are installation informations and tool
usage definitions.
Your help is much appreciated.
Thanks
Sedat Sengul
