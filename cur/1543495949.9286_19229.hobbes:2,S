That is unlikely.  When you ever build a unpatched kernel, you'll find
that the device drivers that you need are unlikely to be built.  There
is little we can do about this.  Any decent distribution will give you
a patch file showing the changes that they've made.  From that you'll
be able to deduce whether or not they're patching the kernel or
reconfiguring it.
On inspecting the Debian kernel patches for 2.0.36, I see that they
added several of the patches that the King does not deem worthy: e.g.
microchannel, PS/2 ESDI, a new AIC7xxx driver.  
Remember that distributions have the additional burden of making their
CD install on as many machines as they can.  
Cheers.
