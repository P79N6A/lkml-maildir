hi i need help i have a data struct that matchs some hardwear but 
gcc is alignin it this meins it is out of sync whit the hardwear 
like 
char is              2 bytes 
long double is 12 bytes 
will thats what gcc thinks 
so i need to tell gcc not to align the data struct 
may be like 
noalign struct ........ 
the main prob is whit long double st[8] 
gcc make long double 12 bytes when it need to be 10 bytes 
  
think you 
  
struct _i386_fpu_st 
{ 
  long long  significand; 
  unsigned char       exponent   ; 
  /* unsigned long       test ; */ 
} ; 
struct _i386_fpu 
{ 
  unsigned short control ; 
  unsigned short rev0    ; 
  unsigned short status  ; 
  unsigned short rev1    ; 
  unsigned short tag     ; 
  unsigned short rev2    ; 
  unsigned long  instructionPointer ; 
  unsigned short instructionSelector ; 
  unsigned short opcode  ; 
  unsigned long  operandPointer ; 
  unsigned short operandSelector ; 
  unsigned short rev3  ; 
  long double    st[8] ; 
  /* struct _i386_fpu_st st[8] ; */ 
  unsigned long rev[400] ; 
  
} ; 
extern struct _i386_fpu * i386_fpuInit(void) ;
