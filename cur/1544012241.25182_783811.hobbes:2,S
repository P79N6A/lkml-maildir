What that documentation is suggesting is that MMIO writes to uncached 
memory (what the normal mapping functions will give you) can pass 
previous writes to cached memory. It doesn't indicate how this is to be 
avoided, however.
The arch that was being discussed in that 2006 discussion was PPC, but 
it appears that it's been changed to ensure that writeX, etc. will 
provide the expected ordering (commit 
f007cacffc8870702a1473d83ba5e4922d54e17c). I'm not sure what 
architecture the author of those paragraphs in 
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt had in mind, though. CCing David 
Howells as he apparently wrote them..
