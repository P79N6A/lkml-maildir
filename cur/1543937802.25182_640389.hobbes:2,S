Hey Jiri,

  For the "TV" key:
f7d32680 3699560314 C Ii:2:006:2 0:8 3 = 064600
f7d32680 3699560330 S Ii:2:006:2 -115:8 5 <
f7d32680 3699640317 C Ii:2:006:2 0:8 3 = 060000
f7d32680 3699640335 S Ii:2:006:2 -115:8 5 <
  For the "POWER" key (again, no trace of a key release line, only key press):
f7d32680 3876362463 C Ii:2:006:2 0:8 2 = 0382
f7d32680 3876362488 S Ii:2:006:2 -115:8 5 <
"SETUP MENU", "LAST", and "INPUT" produce no output on any of the USB
buses (0u, 1u, 2u).
  I'm starting to think that these last 3 keys are broken, or maybe
just not designed to be used as PC keys (the remote is also a learning
universal IR unit, and these keys  work as they should on the TV and
VCR), though the manual mentions no such thing.  Otherwise they might
require some additional Vista-voodoo, seeing as the remote is labeled
"Vista only" (funnily enough, the "Windows" button works just fine in
Linux).  Is this anything like what happened with the special keys on
the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000?
> Thanks for great and detailed bugreport,
  With pleasure, although you are the one to be thanked for helping me
out.  I'll be extremely happy if only we can get the power key working
properly; the other keys are a bonus at this point.
Thank you,
Adolfo
