I'm hoping that Rusty will work with Keith to integrate support for 
2.5.x into the existing modutils package...  it's rather annoying to 
have two totally different modutils when switching between 2.[024].x and 
2.5.x kernels.
/me is building drivers into the kernel for now, which slows down 
debugging, because modules are broken on ia32 and module support isn't 
present on alpha at all anymore [AFAICS]...
