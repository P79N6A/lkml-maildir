I discovered a problem with my laptop keyboard when the machine failed 
to suspend. Pavel Machek pointed me in your direction for guidance. :)
The original issue (swsusp failing) is in this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=113093802700002&r=1&w=2
The side issue is that the keyboard goes completely dead when the 
suspend fails like this. Not even hardware buttons that control the 
intensity of the TFT backlight work.
The problem doesn't happen every time, but it seems to be often enough 
to do some decent testing.
The problem seems to have appeared after 2.6.14 was released. Since the 
  problem is intermittent I can't be 100% sure of this, but it's fairly 
likely since none of the tests before 2.6.14 failed.
