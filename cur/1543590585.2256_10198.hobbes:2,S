Hmmm, I observe similar messages when
- scsi low-level driver (eg. sd, sr, st) linked to the kernel,
- no appropriate (corresponding to any of the above drivers) devices found
  on the hostadapters which have support linked to the kernel.
I don't think it is driver-specyfic. As I looked at the code it would be
difficult to avoid them (unless a linked-to-the-kernel function is able
to detect whether it is called from __init code or from a module
initialization code).
