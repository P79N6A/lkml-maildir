yes, ISA is fragile, and no way do we want to remove the delay, but are 
there strong counter-arguments against doing the clean thing and adding 
an udelay(2) (or udelay(1)) to replace those _p() uses in ISA drivers? 
That removes the global effect once and forever. Initially for 
standalone drivers without early bootup functionality, not platform 
drivers that might need to run before we have calibrated udelay.
if someone runs a fresh new kernel on an ancient device then timings 
_will_ change a bit, no matter what we do. Alignments change, the 
compiler output will change (old compilers get deprecated so a new 
compiler might have to be picked), cache effects change - and this is 
inevitable. The important thing is to not eliminate the delays - but we 
sure dont have to keep them cycle accurate (we couldnt even if we wanted 
to). The only way to get the _exact same_ behavior is to not change the 
kernel at all.
