Thank you both for keeping up on this.  I owe Louis some review that I'm
going to try to get to.

	The "appearance" of the entire default group hierarchy should be
atomic.  When mkdir(2) returns, it is all there.  This does make our
lives a little difficult inside configfs, but it makes everyone else's
lives much easier.

	That is true - it works, and safely, and the lockdep conflict is
the only real known issue.  I'm not wary of changing it, I'm only wary
of breaking it.  That is, I want to understand what is being changed and
be sure that we're keeping the correctness we have so far.  I don't want
to change it and "hope" we got it right, you know?  This makes me
cautious, but don't think I'm against change.  As I stated, having
lockdep work for us is a good thing.
	More replies to the other mails coming.
