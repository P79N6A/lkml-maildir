Thanks for the comments.
I'm not thrilled with the name either, but kill_suid and *remove_suid
were already taken, and I really didn't want to name this something too
similar since there are already so many similarly named functions that
don't do the same thing. I'm definitely open to suggestions for
something different.

Both good suggestions. I'll plan to incorporate them in the next
respin of the set.
