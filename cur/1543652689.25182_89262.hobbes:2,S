The one instance I saw was that the BIOS was reading 8254 in a tight loop
for a calibration purpose, and it was assuming the time proceeded in a
constant speed, to exit the loop. In other words, it never assumed it could
get interrupts. To vm86, interrupts are invisible, but they have impacts on
the actual speed.
