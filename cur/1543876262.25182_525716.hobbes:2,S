I am trying a different way now, fishing the associated device name from
sysfs' symlinks and then reassigning the device access to /dev/sr. Not
that I like it very much but it seems to be the best workaround, even
independent from potential fixes in kernel. I do not count on them
either, considering the hostile tone here.

But the desktop needs some means to deal with that. AFAICS the only
feasible way for applications to communicate about device usage policy
is locking with O_EXCL. Many people do not realize that even read-only
actions do harm when a delicate operation is in progress. This bad
assumption is already hardcoded into crucial components like libblkid
(mount), increasing the risk of creating coasters up to 100 percent for
no good reason, IMHO.

But the kernel knows already that there is a block device behind it. It
is displayed in sysfs. It shall "just" reuse the lock mechanism of that
device, not more and not less. Naturally this "just" definition is
bendable and that is why I initially asked here.

The sad thing is, this is just another assumption. At least on Debian
/dev/sgX belongs to the cdrom group when it's a cdrom device and the
permissions do just invite to work with it.

IIRC there were similar issues with the SCSI command filtering with
both but I am not sure on that.

Serial port? Do we have multiple drivers with multiple interfaces

think so.

CD burning people (at least most of them) do get it right, please
realize that. It is others who come along and disturb the burning
process. And sometimes it is even not their fault, e.g. hald is assumed
to do proper locking with O_EXCL. They may just happen to use different
userspace interfaces, and the kernel lets them clash.
Oh, and please don't kill the messenger, I am not Schilling.
And if you think it is just simple and sufficient to tell people "you
have to use /dev/sr now and everything else is your problem", please
compare that with the time line of devfs deprecation, for example.
The use of /dev/sg* is still common practice, its invention predates
devfs by many years and there is no big campaign telling to switch to
udev and there is no automatic fallback to a safe system (like static
device files) and no obvious way to see what is going on before the
burning process starts. You just get a coaster in the beginning and no
clear way to see why it happens. I guess it will take years for the
you-shall-not-use-sg message to settle down in the heads of users.
Eduard.
