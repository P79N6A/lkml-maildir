Yes, that was the problem that I was trying to circumvent.

Is there any way to circumvent the limitations via software? I have already
upgraded the firmware of my motherboard (and, if I understood it correctly,
it also upgraded the firmware of the Promise controller).
The funny thing is that right after the Power On Self Test, the devices are
probed and then the Promise controller says that the drive supports UDMA2.
Then, when Linux boots, I see this:

Ok, so if this is indeed buggy hardware, one way to make the system not
slow to a crawl would be to have:
	* on ide0 the first HD and the DVD reader;
	* on ide1 the second HD and the CD-Writer.
Since both ide0 and ide1 are VIA controllers, they would be able to cope
with DMA. It will be really a deception with this motherboard if I can't
use the Promise controller (which claimed to be ATA/100 when I bought it
and paid a good deal of money). :-(
Thanks for all your feedback and suggestions, Rogério Brito.
