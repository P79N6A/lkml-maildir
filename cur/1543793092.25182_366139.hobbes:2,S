Well, all the models have li-ion batteries, so levels (in milivolts)
for stuff like "battery empty" should be very similar. If conversion
from ADC to voltage is non-trivial, that's a show stopper I guess.

Actually I think I can refactor in a way that a common core can be
share. I'd hate to copy 1000 lines...
