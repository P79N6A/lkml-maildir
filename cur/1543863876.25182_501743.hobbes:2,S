Which would be me. :)
And no, I don't want to break anything, hence that config option.  If
it's enabled, sysfs should look just like before.  But it looks like we
messed up somewhere and we need to fix it

The name of the config option doesn't really matter as much as the help
text of the option does.  Does reading that help out more?
Basically, new distros can disable that option if their userspace can
handle the new structure of sysfs with the symlinks.  Users of older
distros with newer kernels can enable the option and (hopefully) not
break anything.  So far, it's been working with this being the first
regression reported.

So what does running with this patch make sysfs look like?
