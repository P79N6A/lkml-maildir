Hey Roland,
Please include these three iw_cxgb3 fixes for 2.6.25.  The first two fix
bugs found doing Lustre testing, and the last patch correctly marks
privileged qps.
Shortlog:
      RDMA/cxgb3: Flush the RQ when closing.
      RDMA/cxgb3: fix page shift calculation in build_phys_page_list()
      RDMA/cxgb3: Mark qp as privileged based on user capabilities.
