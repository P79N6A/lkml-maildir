Yes. I see the same. It's because with granules we have intersecting
regions which add_active_range doesn't handle. At least that's what
appears to be the reason. I modified add_active_range to combine an
added intersecting region and it boots. However, present pages in zones is
enormous which probably means hole calculation is wrong. That's what I'm
pursuing now.
