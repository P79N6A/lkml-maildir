Hi developers,
I am looking for your insights and attitudes towards modeling.
If you are interested and have 20 minutes, the survey is available at:
http://cruise.site.uottawa.ca/awf2/ask/models
I have contacted the Linux community because I am currently looking
for a few more responses from those working on operating system
software, and I figured this was a great place to start.  I would
fully understand if you are not able to do this for whatever reason.
If your know one or two other people who might be willing to complete
the survey, we would very much appreciate your assistance (we could
ask them directly, or else give us their contact info).
My name is Andrew Forward, a PhD candidate at the University of
Ottawa, Canada.  I am not subscribed to this mailing list so I would
appreciate if you could cc me at aforward@gmail.com with any questions
or comments.
Thanks,
