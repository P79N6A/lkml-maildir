"inode leak in rd.c" is correct description, what's wrong is that pre5
is the one introducing the leak, and there was nothing to fix there. The
inode of the initrd must be released with iput because it's a virtual
inode, so if we don't iput it from there we'll lose all references to
it.
There are instead a few initrd bugs that I corrected in the
blkdev-pagecache patch while rewriting the ramdisk/initrd pagecache
backed but I'm too lazy to extract them since they're quite low prio,
I'll just wait for the blkdev in pagecache to be merged instead.
