Yeah, but that's a much bigger issue. Not something we can or want to fix
for 2.4.x.
I think it makes most sense as a complete change of interface: instead of
asking the filesystem for the blocknumber, we could ask the filesystem to
generate the buffer list for that page.
Your other this would be solved by this too:

I don't think it's about being a larger IO unit - it can be a smaller IO
unit that isn't even aligned with a 4kB page, for example. It's
potentially valid to have each page split up into 1kB+2kB+1kB requests,
because the filesystem really might be a 2kB system but for some strange
reason isn't doing aligned buffers or whatever.
The issue of a "tail" is the same thing. A 2kB block filesystem with a 512
byte tail, so a page might be 2kB+512B+unmapped if it is at the end of the
file.
But right now there's no way we'd make _those_ kinds of changes. In fact,
right now I'd be happy to just have a working truncate() for a change ;)

Yeah, maybe. It's just that every single case has different semantics
inside the loop. So it would basically boil down to either macros or to
passign around function pointers..

Oh, I agree completely. What you didn't see me was me suggesting to Jeff
that he just remove the check.
It turns out that apparently several low-level drivers complain at that
point, so it's more than just that single test, though.
