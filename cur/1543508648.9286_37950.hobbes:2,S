WE NEED BOTH RAID SYSTEMS IN THE OFFICIAL 2.2 SERIE
I got to that conclusion after taking a week to think about it calmly.
When somebody wanted to make significant patches to ext2, Linus said that he
would
never accept them until the new code is called ext3, which mean both would
exist
at some point. This can perfectly be applyed now to the raid code.
Arguments summary:
- With providing both sytems, and a CONFIG_HOT_RAID option for selecting the
new
  code instead of the old one we satisfy the constaint that no significant
  change must apply in a stable serie:
  people that are running the old code happily can continue with it, and people
  that are running the new one can continue with it.
- RAID is not a 'feature': it does not provide any additional capability to the
  system. It's a 'security' or 'stability' issue: if your system is down
because
  of an attack or is down because of a hardware failure, what's the big
difference ?
  Linus states that security or reliability issues have to be fixed in stable
  series.
- Not providing the new RAID system in the 2.2 serie means that it will not be
  ironed out soon because much fewer people will be abble to install it on a
2.2
  serie, they will also upgrade much less frequently, and nobody would put a
2.3 
  kernel on a production server yet.
I indead see no significant argument agains two raid systems in the 2.2 serie,
as
a natural migration path between 2.0 and 2.4
