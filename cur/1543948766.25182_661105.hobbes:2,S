well, the problem was ia64, not a problem on x86 or other platforms. The 
problem here is ia64 not setting up percpu data structures soon enough. 
It has blown up in the past in other areas, and it will likely blow up 
in the future in other areas as well. It's just not robust to have init 
dependencies on such basic data structures like percpu areas like that.
