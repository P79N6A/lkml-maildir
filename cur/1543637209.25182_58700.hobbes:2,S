the problem with the feature flag check is that I don't want to make it
conditional at runtime, if I start adding branches and checks on the
feature flag (or pointer to functions) I can as well use the ordered
read/writes C version without reading/writing the 64bit atomically. So
the check_config() will be the oops or the not-oops at the first i_size
read/write :).
As for the CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG8B you're right it's needed, setting
CONFIG_M486=y and CONFIG_SMP=y would generate a kernel that would oops
on a 486 and I don't see any other way to get 486+SMP case right without
checking for the X86_FEATURE_CX8 capability at runtime. Not that I think
486+SMP is high prio but yes, theoretically it's a bug.
