You just _want_ to be screwed over whenever your gcc bugs are fixed, don't 
you?
Are you going to complain to the gcc people when they fix their bugs? Or 
are you going to spend months to debug problems that only happen for other 
people, because they happen to have fixed compilers?
There's a real reason why there is a "volatile" there on other 
architectures.
