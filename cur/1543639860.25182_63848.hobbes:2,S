FWIW, the attached program compiles fine against klibc:
: tazenda 36 ; ls -l tests/nfs_no_rpc.stripped 
-rwxrwxr-x    1 hpa      eng         11124 Aug 13 10:57 tests/nfs_no_rpc.stripped*
I have checked it in to the tests/ directory of klibc with a few minor
warnings cleanups, but without messing around with things like adding
command-line parsing (which would be trivial; use getopt()).
