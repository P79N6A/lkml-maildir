So... every program which may modify labelled entities (e.g., for files,
by unlink()/creat()) needs modification for SELinux?
This strikes me as rather impractical if you want to be able to label
files that users may edit: there are a lot of programs users run that
`modify' files in that way. For starters, every web browser, every text
editor...  is it really sensible to require modification of *almost
everything* that can overwrite files lest you magically lose labels that
you thought you had?
(With AppArmor, of course, you never lose labels at all, because there
aren't any.)
(I may be missing something, but I know that when I've tried to use
SELinux to constrain what such programs could manipulate, I was
losing labels to unlink()/creat() left right and centre.)
