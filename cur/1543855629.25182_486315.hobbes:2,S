Subject: [PATCH] Don't compare unsigned variable for <0 in sys_prctl()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In kernel/sys.c::sys_prctl() the argument named 'arg2' is very clearly 
of type 'unsigned long', and when compiling with "gcc -W" gcc also warns :
  kernel/sys.c:2089: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
So this patch removes the test of "arg2 < 0".
For those of us who compile their kernels with "-W" this gets rid of an 
annoying warning. For the rest of you it saves a few bytes of source code ;-)
