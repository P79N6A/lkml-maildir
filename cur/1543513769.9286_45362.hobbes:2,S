Ok code gurus...
here's my problem take a look and poke around.
First compile works. But ppp wouldn't work kppp say i don't have ppp
support. However it works after i run "pppd" as root. And i was just
typing "pppd" and enter.
Second compile.
booting linux....
etc etc..
Out of memory
--System Halted
Thrid compile...
make bzImage
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -02 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-incldue scripts/split-include.c
In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:36,
		 from scripts/split-include.c:26:
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:25: liux/errno.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1
[root@shangrila linux]#
So there's the problems.
here's the config:
Redhat 6
Pentium 2 350 on generic BX mb with 96 megs of PC-100 ram.
Nvidia TNT nvidia version 1 drivers
Sblive using 0.3 beta drivers
Realtek PCI NE2000 using the PCI NE2000 driver in kernel
Maxtor ATA 66 10 g harddisk no ATA 66 controler
Seagate 4 G harddisk ( winblows  fat32)
Thanks in advance!
