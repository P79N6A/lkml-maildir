I would have phrased the comment somewhat different.
Once Unix adopted the process and file I/O abstraction,
a system wide user count became meaningless.
Unix should be contrasted with Primos or VMS where the
user memory space or program and serial terminal I/O 
are used in defining the multiuser time-sharing capabilities
of the system.
