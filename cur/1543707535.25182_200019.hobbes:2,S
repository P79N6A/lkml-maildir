No, that's OK - the new kernel thread sets TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before waking
the invoking thread via complete():
new thread:
	/* OK, tell user we're spawned, wait for stop or wakeup */
	__set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	complete(&create->started);
	schedule();
invoker:
	wait_for_completion(&create->started);
	create->result = find_task_by_pid(pid);
	wait_task_inactive(create->result);
It's the window after the complete() and before the schedule() where
wait_task_inactive() is spinning.
