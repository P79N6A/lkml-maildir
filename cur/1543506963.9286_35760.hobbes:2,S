GDB (and, consequently, its GUI frontends), doesn't support hardware-based
memory access breakpoints (aka watchpoints) on Intel CPUs. Doing this probably
would require some kernel support (extending ptrace?). Is there any reason why
it isn't done? (or is it already done somewhere?)
Since it doesn't seem to me very difficult, I think I could try to do it
myself unless there is some reason not to.
