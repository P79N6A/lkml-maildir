This all sounds like the problem I had with 2.0.3x (x=2 or 3). I have
read several reports of this error. The earliest error was apparently
with 2.0.18.
The 53c7,8xx Driver reports:
   scsi0 : WARNING : INTFLY with no completed commands.
just before corrupting the disk. The BSD port always tells something
like:
   ncr53c810-0-<target 0, lun 0>: phase change 2-3 6@00fff828 resid=2.
   ncr53c810-0-<target 0, lun 0>: phase change 2-7 10@00fff62c resid=4.
These are the corrupted disk types I'm aware of:
IBM DPES-31080
IBM DCAS-34330 Rev: S65A
IBM DORS
1.2 Gbyte HP SCSI
mostly but not exclusively IBM drives.
One report states it happend often while copying data to the 4th
partition of the harddisk using mtools. This indicates that it's not
directly the filesystem codes fault.
In the following example the DOS partition got overwritten:
Disk /dev/sda: 134 heads, 62 sectors, 1019 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 8308 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1             1      370  1536949    6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
/dev/sda2           371      402   132928   82  Linux swap

The limit seems to be ok here.
Another user was able to start fdisk after the corruption. He told me
the extended partitions were set to zero while the primary partitions
looked Ok. After reboot the extended partitions were back again and
just the first partition was corrupted.
