That one? Ouch, it is a bit dated according to the webpage ;-) I don't recall
that it was discussed on LKML, either.
SuSE (Jens Axboe and myself) have also done work on the md multipathing,
supporting failover and load balancing and in general giving the code a rinse;
as well as extensions to mdadm to make them work.
The patches currently live at 
http://lars.marowsky-bree.de/dl/md-mp/
(And are included in SuSE's kernel release, of course ;-)
Currently, for 2.5 / 2.6, I think I really like the SCSI midlayer stuff. In
the past, I didn't, because it constrains everything to SCSI. But then,
everything so far _has_ been SCSI, except for weird arch stuff like s390(x)
DASDs ;-)
Doing it in the SCSI layer has the advantage of not being constrained to block
devices, but also working with tapes. Oh well, we'll see ;-)
Sincerely,
