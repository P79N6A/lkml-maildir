I have seen the light. Seriously, I initially had it as you said, but
Linus was strongly recommending cacheline size objects to 
avoid false sharing other than on the lock word
However, there should be no problem whatsoever to bring that back
to 2 words.

Counters are only there for lock statistics.
padding is only there for filling the cacheline (might be obsolute anyway.
What can be done is to make the ____cacheline_aligned a configuration
option. Nothing in the system relies on this. I'll see how I'll
do this.
Also, this can be brought down to one word, if we don't have
demand based kernel object allocation and/or multiple queue requirements
as requested by BenLeHaise.
Rusty, how would your pin based approach be effected by this ?
