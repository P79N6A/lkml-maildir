Daniel,
That last patch I sent is currently running on an
eXtremeRAID 2000 Mylex controller.
I haven't tried it yet on other controller
versions.  When you give it a try, let me know
what controller type you are using.
I thought I was having difficulties writing
new disk partitions.  But it seems to be working
fine now.  I don't know what I was seeing earlier.
I can't seem to reproduce it.
So, as far as I know, this driver is completely
functional.  I just need to complete the conversion
to using the dma interfaces, and do more rigorous
tests.
Getting test coverage on other controller versions would
be great, too.
Dave
