	I don't understand you here, sorry, complicated sentence are
hard for me :<. Anyway, i am one of the one who hacked and old version
of this driver for 2.4.7+, of course i can understand it's a GPL

but like another guy wrote (sorry, i haven't his name liying around),
binary only module is *almost* better than no support.
