Yes, it is.  2.6.21 was OK, but only within a narrow and 
ill-characterized set of conditions (framebuffer not compiled into the 
kernel, in particular.)  It appears to me that the interaction between 
STR and video on this system is extremely fragile, to the point that any 
minor perturbations in the state can break it, and that that is the real 
underlying problem here.
