For i386
2.2.18
	gcc 2.7.2 or egcs-1.1.2
	gcc 2.95 and current Red Hat 2.96 both seem to generate valid kernels
		but are not recommended (insufficient testing)
2.4.0test
	egcs-1.1.2
	(gcc 2.95 miscompiles some of the long long uses)
	Red Hat's 2.96 seems to generate valid kernels but don't expect
		sympathy if you report a bug in one built that way
