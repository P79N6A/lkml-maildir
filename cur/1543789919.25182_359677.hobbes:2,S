True.
If you do not like the current situation, evolve the SCSI core (and all 
drivers) to where you think they should be.
The correct answer is NOT to duplicate information between 
Scsi_Host_Template and Lubens_Hardware_Struct.

The only things that matter are (a) what the code is now, and (b) what 
changes are needed to get where we need to be.
Thus, regardless of whether or not libata-scsi meets the needs of 
SAS+SATA hardware, libata-scsi is where all SCSI<->ATA translation 
should occur.  If you are dissatisfied, evolve the code to where it 
needs to be.

Naming is completely irrelevant.  Just modify the code.
