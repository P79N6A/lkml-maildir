i remember frequently breaking the UP build wrt. spin_is_locked() when
redoing all the spinlock primitives for PREEMPT_RT.
looking closer, here's the debug variant it appears:
 /* without debugging, spin_is_locked on UP always says
  * FALSE. --> printk if already locked. */
 #define spin_is_locked(x) \
	({ \
	 	CHECK_LOCK(x); \
		if ((x)->lock&&(x)->babble) { \
			(x)->babble--; \
			printk("%s:%d: spin_is_locked(%s:%p) already locked by %s/%d\n", \
					__FILE__,__LINE__, (x)->module, \
					(x), (x)->owner, (x)->oline); \
		} \
		0; \
	})
(the comment is misleading a bit, this _is_ the debug branch. The
nondebug branch has a spin_is_locked() definition too.)
