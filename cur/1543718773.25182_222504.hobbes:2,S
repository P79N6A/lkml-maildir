Being an old hardware user and tester (I still have a i386 and i486SLC
where I do testing on!), I strongly support the inclusion of the
emulator. I think that it should even be extended/fixed to catch the
remaining opcode(s).

There are some application that register signal handling functions IIRC
for SIGILL, SIGSEGV and the like to do internal error trapping on their
own (not only OOo comes to mind). These would probably be f*cked up if they
didn't call the LD_PRELOADed signal handler...
