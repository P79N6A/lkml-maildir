philip copeland did a whole set of patches for coreutils to allow
directio for both read write and mixed sizes even
the rpm is at
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs/files/source/RHAT/RHAS3/coreutils-4.5.3-33.src.rpm,
I think he took it up with the maintainers but so far had no luck
it makes sense to have this stuff, we use it a lot.
