The good old handful of suggestions:
- Use a dedicated disc for the task.
- Use an empty disc so there is no fragmentation.
- Buy a bigger disk, they have high bandwidths.
- Buy a more "specialized" disc.
  for e.x.: Western Digital Raptor X(*) a 150GB, 10-KRPM S-ATA disc.
- Buy several discs and use RAID 0
  or alternate between discs when writing.
- use XFS. AFAIK XFS has about the best "large file" and "high
bandwidth" characteristics.
- that with XFS you can preallocate the files doesn't seem relevant in
this case. It's more for the case that you write several files
simultaneously over a longer period of time.
- Write to one large file and separate the individual files later.
if you are sure that you don't get a power-failure:
- Disable Write-Barriers, especially on a logging-filesystem.
- Enable write-caching.
(hdparm doesn't appear to be able to do that with a SATA-disc, but
blktool appears to be able to)
The later has a good chance of corrupting your filesystem when you do
get a power-failure!!!

I don't think you want something from the server-line,
SCSI/FibreChannel/...?
IIRC i read a something about the first 100MB/s disc with in the 15-KRPM
league.
