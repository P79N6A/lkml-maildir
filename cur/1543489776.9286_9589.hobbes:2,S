Rot.  Kindly remember that they had a very embarrassing situation when the
bought Hotmail, forced a migration from Solaris to NT... and then had to move
back because NT just plain couldn't cope.  And I assure you that Microsoft
fears Sun *at least* as they do us --- probably more so; Scott McNealy is
quite visible and quite happy to needle Microsoft in public, in venues that
we can't currently touch because we aren't major CEOs and therfore lack a
certain credibility with the target audience.
As such, Hotmail on Linux would actually be saving face for them; sure, Linux 
is a threat, but the thought of McNealy gloating over how Microsoft's free
mail service runs on *his* company's OS just has to be galling.
