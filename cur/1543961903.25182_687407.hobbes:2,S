And what do you think is happening _after_ the merge window closes, when
we're supposed to be fixing bugs?  People work on new code.  And, in fact, they
have to, if they want to be ready for the next merge window.

How about, instead, putting limits on the amount of stuff that's going to be
merged during the next window?

Well, and when's the time for fixing bugs?  Surely not during the merge window
and also not after that, because otherwise people won't be ready for the next
merge window with the new code.

Exactly.  Moreover, the code is now being merged at a pace that makes it
physically impossible to review it given the human resources we have.

Sorry to say that, but I don't think this is realistic.  What happens after the merge
window is people go and develop new stuff.  They look at the already merged
code only if they have to.  Also, there are a _few_ people testing the kernel
carefully enough to see the more subtle problems, let alone debugging and
fixing them.

My point is, given the width of the merge windown, there's too much stuff
going in during it.  As far as I'm concerned, the window can be a week long
or whatever, but let's make fewer commits over a unit of time.
Thanks,
