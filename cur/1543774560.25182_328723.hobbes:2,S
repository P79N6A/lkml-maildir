This works for me:
wget 
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/i386/SRPMS/udev-058-1.src.rpm
rpmbuild --rebuild udev-058-1.src.rpm
rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/udev-058-1.i386.rpm
wget 
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/i386/SRPMS/mkinitrd-4.2.17-1.src.rpm
rpmbuild --rebuild mkinitrd-4.2.17-1.src.rpm
rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/mkinitrd-4.2.17-1.i386.rpm
Thanks
