OK, but what is the interrupt handler supposed to do if the
vxtime.last* values are invalid?  I guess assume delta = 0?
BTW, in the interrupt handler there is:
		__asm__("mulq %1\n\t"
		        "shrdq $32, %%rdx, %0"
		        : "+a" (delta)
		        : "rm" (vxtime.tsc_quot)
		        : "rdx");
Is the "+a" a typo?
