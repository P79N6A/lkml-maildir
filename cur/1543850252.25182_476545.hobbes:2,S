I am working on a story about the GPL 3.0, and I'd like someone who 
contributes to the Linux Kernel to chat about why the GPL 3.0 is making 
folks unhappy. Anyone got 10 minutes for a phone call on this tomorrow 
or Friday? I am on the west coast of the USA, so someone within 3 hours 
time difference would be best, if not someone local to the SF Bay area.
