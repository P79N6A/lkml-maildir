That's exactly the problem; trying to save a state from within the kernel 
would probably necessitate a freezer hack, which we are trying so dearly to 
avoid.
The only way the kexec approach may be successful, is by completely relying 
on the kexec'd hibernate-mode kernel to save state, otherwise we would be 
back to square one.  And if that required a special boot procedure for the 
kexec'd hibernate-mode kernel, then why not?
Thanks!
