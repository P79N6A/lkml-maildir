I seem to also be having problems with this patch.  My OpenPOWER 720
stopped booting with 2.6.14-git10(and later).  Just using defconfig.
64k page size NOT enabled.  If I back out the 64k page size patch,
2.6.14-git10 boots.  I'm trying to get more info but it is painful.
It dies before xmon is initialized.
I could have sworn that I booted 2.6.14-git7 with the 64k page size
patch applied.  But, I can't do that now either.
Some co-workers have successfully booted other POWER systems with these
kernels.  So, it must be specific to my hardware/LPAR configuration.
