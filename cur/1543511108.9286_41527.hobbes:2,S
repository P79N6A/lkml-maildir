In my implementation free_inodes() walks only the unused list. In the
unused list I place only valid inodes that are there only for caching
purposes i_count == 0.
Inodes that are caching nothing are put back to the slab cache immediatly 
(so I save memory in such case).
Splitting the inodes into two lists I avoid completly to waste time with
inodes with i_count > 0 (infact I removed such check in CAN_UNUSE).
