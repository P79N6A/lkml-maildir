Hi Andrew,
for some unknown reason, I suddenly found the attached typo. It doesn't
cause anything bad (at least not on my computer according to some
tests), but is still very much so embarassing, so please apply to the
kernel tree. Who knows, maybe it fixes some obscure unfixeable bug for
some people.

Thanks,
Ronald
