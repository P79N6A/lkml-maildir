Heh. Lets not be too harsh though. Chasing people who add config options
without help text is a thankless task for the most part, but I'm grateful to
ESR for doing it. I must admit I was actually counting on him to catch the
ones I'd missed.
It was only when he ignored my patch which removed an offending symbol and
explained the status of a couple of false positives, and kept asking about
them instead of placing them on his 'ignore' list that it became irritating.
I objected, he assures me they're on the ignore list now, and we're all 
happy.
