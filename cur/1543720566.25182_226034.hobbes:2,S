Why does this NOT do what is should be doing, i.e. umount no matter what?
Sometimes I get 
umount2 : Stale NFS file handle
umount : machine/path: Illegal seek
and it does not umount it.
What part of
 -f "Force unmount (in case of unreachable NFS system)" (umount man page)
does linux not understand?
shouldn't umount -f umount no matter what?
