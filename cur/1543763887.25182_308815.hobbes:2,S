If they are the highest priority task, and running as FIFO this is the
proper behavior.

If X is not at a higher priority than the test you are running, it will
never get a chance to run.

The interrupts do get processed. Now the bottom halves and tasklets may
be starved if they are set at a lower priority than your test (ie. the
ksoftirqd thread). But most likely they are processed too.

If the run_test takes 2 minutes, you should see a large difference in
the two outputs.
