For what it's worth, I built an x86_64 kernel (2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc3) for this
system and booted it. I didn't apply the blacklist patch yet. The system booted
fine, no complaints in the boot messages
Performance is good and the drive appears quite stable so far. I'm going to beat
on it a bit more over the next couple of days. If there is a particular test
that would be of interest, please let me know. I'm planning to do large reads
and writes with dd and a couple of runs with bonnie.
This might explain why some people are running Seagate drives with sata_sil with
no apparent problems.
