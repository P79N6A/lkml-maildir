Aha ... ;-) thanks for the pointer. Will poke at that.

Hmmm ... I guess people with SMP normally have lots of RAM anyway,
and those few that care could just config NR_CPUS down. Shame though,
automagical is much nicer. Maybe we can work out exactly why it's broken
instead.

Well at a page granularity level you have alloc_pages_node(cpu_to_node).
I suppose technically that's not guaranteed, but on boot it'll never fall back.
If you need it in permanent KVA, you can remap it into the vmalloc reserve
area.
Why do you need to do it that late, should be able to do it once you've parsed
mptables? alloc_bootmem / alloc_bootmem_node ?
