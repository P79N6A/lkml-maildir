Subject: [FIX] rename over mount point fails

Hi Linus,
A while ago, Chris Yeoh discovered while testing Posix
compliance that renaming a directory over another directory
that was in use as a mount point did very bad things[tm].
It looked like there was a loop in the d_hash list for the
directory we tried this trick in.
Here is a fix ... I do not understand the dcache well enough
to say if this is correct, but it does stop the kernel hanging.
