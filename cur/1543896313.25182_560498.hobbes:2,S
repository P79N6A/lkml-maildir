Ok, so if refusing to run software that's tampered with isn't acceptable, 
and disabling the hardware that would be needed to talk on the network 
isn't acceptable. how exactly can they prevent a system that's been 
tampered with from accessing their network? (something even you say they 
have a right to do)
asking a device that's running software that you haven't verified to give 
you a checksum of itself isn't going to work becouse the software can just 
lie to you.
you claim they have this right, but then claim to prohibit every possible 
method of them excercising that right.
pick one side or the other, you don't get both.
