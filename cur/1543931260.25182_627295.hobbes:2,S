Transmeta TM5800 CPU with nominal frequency 933 MHz, but it has a
hardware(!) 'ondemand' governor over the range of frequencies that
the user allowed scaling over, irrespective of the software governor.
(That is, if the CPU can do 300,533 and 933 MHz, and setting the
min/max to 300/533 will cause the hardware to 'ondemand' between 300
and 533 only. And that even if 'performance' is set on the software
side - so the only way to enforce 'performance' is to actually set
min=933.)

Increasing x above 10 yields only 1313-1315 values, so nothing more to see.
Note the values < 1313!! They only happen during scaling.
(I think scaling is the most important sideexercise in this test,
even on hardware which does not have hardware governors - e.g. your
average Intel/AMD CPUs.)
