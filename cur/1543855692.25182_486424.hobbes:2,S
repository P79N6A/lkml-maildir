Hi, Andrew, hi Alan, hi others.
First of all, I would kindly ask you that you keep me in the Cc'ed
messages.
I'm currently finishing grades of (loads and loads) of students and I'm
having a hard time keeping up with my health problems and real life
work, let alone the traffic of lkml.
Well, let me get straight to the problem. I have an Asus A7V (Classic)
motherboard with a VIA KT133 chipset and it has the two usual VIA IDE
controllers and two extra Promise PDC20265 controllers. Right now, my
setup is the following (given advice that once Alan gave me, but he may
not recall it):
* hda: DVD+-RW burner;
* hdc: Plain CD-ROM reader;
* hde: Seagate ST3160021A (7200.??) drive;
* hdg: QUANTUM FIREBALLlct15 30 drive.
The problem is that whenever I plug the Quantum drive, I get stack
traces like this one (with a bit of context, so that you can get sense of
what I am talking about):

This is what I get when I boot with a 2.6.18.3 (custom) kernel *AND*
with the irqpoll option already enabled. The kernel 2.6.19-rc6 that I
have here doesn't work at all if I pass the irqpoll option (it just
freezes right at "Uncompressing Linux" nothing is displayed at least
during a minute or so---I think that it hanged).
Since Linus Torvalds once said something to the effect that "users that
are willing to help with patches are worth their weight in gold", I
would like to contribute here. :-)
I am willing to do a git bisect to see which may be a problematic patch
or not, but the "irq 10: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll"
option)" is one that I reported to Andrew quite some time ago (I thought
that it had gone away), and it didn't manifest itself until I had to
reuse this extra drive, since I am doing a work that is producing a lot
of data.
Please, if you want any further information, don't hesitate to ask. I
can test patches that are even moderately invasive, since I'm talking
backups of the vital data of my system with regularity.
Regards and thank you very much for any help, Rogério Brito.
