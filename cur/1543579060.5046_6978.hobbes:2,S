I'm not the one with a problem but maybe it has something to do with win98
and/or the driver used there. I intend to test this myself eventually and
see if I can do something based on Donald Beckers suggestions on eeprom.
Unless someone else feels like playing with this ... anyone?
Does everyone seeing this have a Rhine-II, pci id 1106:3065, and not the
older chip found in dfe530tx with pci id 1106:3043?
