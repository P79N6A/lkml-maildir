Subject: wrong hardlink count for /proc/PID directories

Hi,
Tested on some 2.6.[7-9] kernels: a stat call for a /proc/SOMEPID
directory returns a hard link count of 3, which is invalid, since these
directories have three subdirectories (attr, fd and task) and hence the hard
link counter should be 5.
This causes at least 'find' (gnu findutils) to malfunction, it does not
descend under /proc/SOMEPID/fd and /proc/SOMEPID/attr. See also:

bye,
Egmont
