Additionally, for devices like the above that need either to rely on
userland for firmware download or to allocate large amounts of memory
for firmware backup/restore, I think we need to revive the pre-suspend
and post-resume notifiers ... Of course, if a device that needs userland
to reload a firmware is on the swap patch, then we have a chicken & egg
problem, but there is no easy solution for that one, unless the driver
uses the pre-suspend callback to pre-load the firmware that it will need
for resume
