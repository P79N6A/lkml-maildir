What happens if you do? I mean, it doesn't make even conceptual sense,
really. The rootfs is always there: that's its entire purpose.

busybox has a switch_root tool which (conceptually) rm -rf's everything
on the root filesystem and then does such a mount. (After all whatever
is on that filesystem is inaccessible after the overmount, so keeping
it around is just a waste of memory.)
