Note that you'll only be able to fit an hour or so of music in there, and
figuring out how to switch playlists is left as an exercise for the masochists. :)
Other than that, it's pretty straightforward conceptually - just create a very
minimal kernel that supports only your sound card and whatever else you need,
boot it with 'init=/boot/music.sh' or similar, and have music.sh be a tiny
script that mounts your music stuff, copies the files to a ramdisk, then
unmounts the disk and does an hdparm command to spin it down.
If you're clever, you'll think of a way to have an initrd that has all the filesystem
you need on it, except maybe for the actual audio that you'll load from another disk.
