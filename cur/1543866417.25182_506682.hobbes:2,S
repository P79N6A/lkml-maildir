Yes, I read the 4.1.1 docs:
	By default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is

That is the whole basis for my argument, when you declare something "int," 
most programmers would consider that to be SIGNED regardless of whether it 
is 32 bits, 13 bits, or 1 bit.
No doubt it is configurable because of the existance of brain-dead 
compilers that treat them as unsigned.
