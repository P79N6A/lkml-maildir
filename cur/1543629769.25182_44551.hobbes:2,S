I wasn't suggesting a magic readlink(2). I was suggesting a *real*
one. Device nodes get stored in the physical tree (what you call
driverfs), and the entries in the logical tree are symlinks. Such as:
	/dev/scsi/host0  symlink to  /dev/bus/pci0/slot1/function2
or something like that. Easy to implement, easy to understand, easy to
manage.
