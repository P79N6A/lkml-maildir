the boot parameter will always work and it avoids a new zone. btw, if we
would link the driver into the kernel no boot parameter would be
necessary, if the hardware would be discovered it could allocated its
tons of memory with bootmem. But it sounds like there are too many
drivers in troubles so I believe we can't link them all.
