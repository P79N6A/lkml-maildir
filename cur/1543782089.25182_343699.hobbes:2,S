Yep I think of programs like memtest86 when I think of stand-alone
programs.

Yes, thanks.

Ok. As for parameters I would expect most of them to be mount options.
Just a bit of food for thought.  There seem to be two different kinds
of workloads for non-local filesystems.  Bandwidth intensive workloads
where files are read and written.  Cache intensive workloads (like
kernel compiles) where performance directly relates to how
efficiently you can make use of the page cache, and not get buried
in cache contention.
