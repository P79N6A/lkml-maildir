Mmm, anyone with a similar problem? What should I do, make a profile
like explained in Documentation/basic_profiling.txt or is the above
information about the function where the processes are "stuck" enough?
One thing I forgot to mention, during the several minutes the processes
are stuck on that function there is no disk activity, so it's not the
processes being starved. In fact, there is no other activity on the
machine apart from the copy.
