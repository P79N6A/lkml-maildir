The PPC implementation would be hard to port to x86, since it relies on
the load-linked/store-conditional stuff to provide a fast primitive for
atomic_dec_if_positive().
The only way I found to implement that on x86 was to use cmpxchg. On my
machine, therefore, a spinlock-based semaphore implementation turns out
to be at least as fast for the "fast" path (and is naturally much more
efficient for the slow path).
