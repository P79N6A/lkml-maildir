The breakage is that devices that are happy to suspend with enabled 
interrupts can no longer be suspended from userspace. Refusing to 
suspend a single device on the basis that some other driver on the bus 
may, potentially, at some point require some suspend code to be run with 
disabled interrupts is not a sensible choice. Especially since I can't 
actually find a single driver in the kernel tree that currently uses 
this functionality.

That would still not have provided anywhere near enough warning.

The existence of the power/state interface wasn't a bug - it was a 
deliberate decision to add it. It's the only reason the 
dpm_runtime_suspend() interface exists. It's perfectly reasonable to 
refer to it as a flawed interface, or perhaps even a buggy one. But in 
itself, it's clearly not a bug. And it's perfectly reasonable for 
userland to depend on interfaces that are deliberately exposed by the 
kernel.

It's used on every Ubuntu and Suse system, and the change means that 
certain functionality no longer works - it's now impossible to prevent 
my wireless hardware from drawing power when I'm not using it, for 
example. If the WE power operations were deliberately disabled, then 
that would also be a bug.
