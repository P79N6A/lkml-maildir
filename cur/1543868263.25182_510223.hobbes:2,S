Hello,
	Thanks for reply, I just want to ask one question:
	Those patches are now merged in -mm, and I noticed that Andrew Morton after applying them did fix my bad coding style and check for CONFIG_PM=n that I didn't include
	Now should I resend two last patches or not ?
Regards, Maxim Levitsky
PS:  Actualy I have planned to send those patches a little bit later , and do more checks like the coding style stuff, mailer problems, etc... 
but I noticed that 2.6.20 breaks link detection on my card,
and I even saw report here on LKML about that, so I decided to send them now
Of cource I did check them for code correctness , and I actualy used them for about a month.
I tried to do as little as possible changes, and verify each line.
