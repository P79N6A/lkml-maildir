Or, if you wanted to be experimental, you could pull tag (not branch) 
'upstream-20050627-1' of
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git
to obtain the same changes.
I think I will start using tags for my submissions, which will eliminate 
an old problem with BK:  After emailing a BitKeeper pull request to you, 
I had to stop pushing to the repo, until you pulled.  With tags, I can 
keep on committing changes, without worrying that you are pulling from a 
moving target.
