Kai: go grab a copy of EROS from the website at www.eros-os.org.  This is
exactly how EROS is structured.  In the EROS case, the kernel moves a sequential
byte range; the kernel itself knows nothing of argument structure.

One can -- a POSIX environment in fact existed on KeyKOS, the predecessor of
EROS.
