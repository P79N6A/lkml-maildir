Hi,
I git-cloned qgit-2.1 from your repository, then ran `qmake qgit.pro`, but `make` gave me errors.
Afterwards I deleted src/Makefile, ran `qmake-qt4 qgit.pro` and `make` starts compiling some files but the process ends with other errors.
This is the command line:
filippo@master:/usr/src/git/qgit$ make
cd src && make -f Makefile

I'm running Debian Etch 4.0 with vanilla kernel version 2.6.23.1 and I have the following packages installed:
filippo@master:/usr/src/git/qgit$ dpkg -l | grep qt4
ii libqt4-core			4.2.1-2+etch1	Qt 4 core non-GUI functionality runtime library
ii libqt4-dev			4.2.1-2+etch1	Qt 4 development files
ii libqt4-gui			4.2.1-2+etch1	Qt 4 core GUI functionality runtime library
ii libqt4-qt3support	4.2.1-2+etch1	Qt 3 compatibility library for Qt 4
ii libqt4-sql			4.2.1-2+etch1	Qt 4 SQL database module
ii qt4-dev-tools		4.2.1-2+etch1	Qt 4 development tools
what am I doing wrong?
Cheers.
