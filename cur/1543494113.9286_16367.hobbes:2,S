Hi,
I'm not sure if this has already been covered, but it's been happening
ever since I got bttv to work.  I haven't reported it because I don't
have much info about the lockups (logs aren't updated and I don't [yet]
have a good way to do console over serial).  Here's what I know:
* Video card/X server doesn't seem to matter...happens on my voodoo3 as
often as it did on my cheapo ATI.
* Window manager doesn't seem to matter...happens running afterstep,
fvwm, and kwm.
* Only happens on xawtv startup before an image is displayed (I've had
it running for over a week after a successful startup...also happened on
previous two versions of xawtv I had installed...now running latest)
* I'm running a turboTV pci card (not sure about the chip specifics...I
can get that if it'd help)
* MB is a FIC VA503+ with an AMD K6-2/300
* Lockup is almost guaranteed with heavy disk usage (IDE)...still
happens, but less often, when HD is idle.
If this amounts to _zero_ valuable info, I'll figure out a way to
capture some debugging info.
Thanks,
--Fred
