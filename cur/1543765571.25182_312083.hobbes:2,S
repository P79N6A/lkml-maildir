I used to be able to reproduce it 100% by doing this on an vanilla
upstream kernel. Then it changed behaviour so I only saw it happening
on the Fedora kernel.  For the latest Fedora update kernel I backported
this change..
- x86_64: Only free PMDs and PUDs after other CPUs have been flushed
as a 'try it and see'.  At first I thought it killed the bug, but
a day or so later, it started doing it again.
In the Fedora kernel we have a patch which restricts /dev/mem reading,
so I got suspicious about this interacting with any of the changes
that had happened to drivers/char/mem.c
Out of curiousity, I backported the 3-4 patches from .12rc to
the Fedora .11 kernel, and haven't seen the problem since.
The bizarre thing is I can't explain why any of those patches would
make such a difference.  Given the bug seems to be coming and going
for me, its possible its just masked the problem.
