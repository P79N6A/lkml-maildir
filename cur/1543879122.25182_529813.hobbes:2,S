Quoting Frank Ch. Eigler, from the SystemTAP team :
"The LTTng user-space programs use it today.  Systemtap used to support
the earlier marker prototype and will be rapidly ported over to this
new API upon acceptance."

I wanted the community to come to an agreement regarding the
instrumentation mechanism before submitting a data transport backend.

Yes. The one I envisage to mainline is LTTng, available there :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
. It aims at providing the lowest system
disturbance and best performances possible, with reentrancy from almost
any kernel call site while keeping the task of adding new
instrumentation as easy as possible for the programmer. The current
patches are against 2.6.21-rc6-mm1. Is comes in small modules easy to
merge incrementally, which should make the whole process easier.
LKET, another tracer built on top of SystemTAP, can also be used to
extract the data to user space.
