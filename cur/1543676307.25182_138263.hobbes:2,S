Hi All
I am having this issue I don't know how to solve (digged
the source, it didn't clarify)
I have this kind of half complex data structure that 
needs to be per-cpu and I need to initialize them. 
The problem is it contains an array of list_heads 
and I cannot initialize that with an static initializer, 
AFAIK:
#define NUMBER_OF_QUEUES 256
struct rtf_h {
	spinlock_t lock;
	struct list_head queues[NUMBER_OF_QUEUES];
}
static DEFINE_PER_CPU (struct rtf_h, rtf_lh);
So I want to initialize those - I cannot use the variable
initializing because (a) it is very dirty to add a huge 
number of INIT_LIST_HEAD and (b) it would break the
DEFINE_PER_CPU() semantics, as I assume they are copied
and thus the values would be broken.
So I can have it initialized except the list_heads (only
the locks) and then manually initialize the list_heads 
with some rth_h_init() function;
Now the question is: how do I walk each structure that is
associated to each CPU - I mean, something like:
struct rtf_h *h;
for_each_cpu (h, rtf_lh) {
	rtf_h_init (h);
}
TIA
