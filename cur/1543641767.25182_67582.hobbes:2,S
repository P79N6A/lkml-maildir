Hmm ... it may actually look like though I have a hosed controller
on my hands, and that it is actually the SCSI error handling (or lack thereof)
that causes the oops ... something tells me that 2.4.19 is able to 'offline'
the controller correctly, but 2.5.32 is not ...
Bill, have you looked closer into this ? Even though a hosed controller
is the reason for my OOPS, I guess that won`t explain the OOPS you`re seing.
