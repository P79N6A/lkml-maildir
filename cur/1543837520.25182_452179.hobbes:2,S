Hi Tony, Komal,

Not that 13 MHz cannot actually be prescaled between 7 and 12 MHz, no
matter how you look at it.

I've now taken Komal's patch (#4). Here is a proposed patch which brings
the prescaler computation formula in line with your comment and table
above. It could be applied on top of Komal's patch unless it causes a
problem on some of the OMAP systems. For XOR = 13 MHz, it changes the
prescaler from 0 to 1. For XOR = 19.2 MHz it changes the prescaler from
2 to 1.
I don't have any hardware to test it, though. If it happens to be
better to be slightly over 12 MHz than slightly below 7 MHz, the
"> 12000000" condition below can be replaced with "> 14000000".
