I know that, and I've already done that as a temporary solution. But syslogd
syncs every line written for a good reason, namely that if the machine
crashes you don't want to lose the last few lines that were logged. They are
the most likely place to look for suspicious happenings. So I want a proper
fix, not a "disable the safety feature" kludge.
