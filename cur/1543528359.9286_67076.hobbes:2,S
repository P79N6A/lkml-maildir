For procfs, symlink permissions do matter.
You can't readlink a procfs symlink that's not readable by you.
I'm thinking of /proc/N/cwd.
I don't know what other permissions are implied, but `ls -l
/proc/self/fd' shows me three symlinks with lrwx------ permission and
one with lr-x------ permission.  There might even be a reason.
