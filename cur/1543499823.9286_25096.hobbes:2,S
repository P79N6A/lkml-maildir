could you (or someone else) elaborate on the issues with sendfile and
asynch sendfile ? I'm curious..
The current sendfile() is blocking right, so you basically need a fork()
for serving a file ? And that an asynch sendfile would start the
operation, return immediately, kernel fiddles with pages and sockets, and
delivers a signal when done ? 
And this is faster than using non-blocking separate write()'s from mmap'ed
files in a select() loop (single thread model).
If so, what does the sigio patches you mention do ?
