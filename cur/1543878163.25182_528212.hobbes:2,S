Tabs should be used for indent, not padding. People wanting to use
different-sized tabs can change settings in their editor, i.e.
to make a tab 12 instead of 8. Or 6. Or whatever. If tabs only ever
appear at the front, this works, it breaks when tabs are used to line
up foo->bar=1; foo->boom=17; statements.
