Having several kernels is usually not a problem.  You simply keep
several kernel images around, and set up lilo (or other loader)
to offer a kernel menu when booting.  I have 4 kernels ready to boot,
that way: 2.0.36 and 3 of the latest 2.4-test kernels.
See "man lilo" for details.  You don't need extra partitions
for this!
Most of userspace turns out to be backwards compatible, so new
stuff will usually work with old kernels.  At least that is my
experience running debian.
If you run into
seriouys trouble here, consider keeping two sets of executables
in separate directories, and have your login script set up
PATH depending on kernel version.  (uname -r provides
the version)
Something like: export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/`uname -r`: (and
whatever 
else you want a path to.)
You may then have /usr/local/2.0.36  with corresponding tools,
/usr/local/2.4.0-test1-ac22 and so on, if this is necessary.
