I tried doing
#define ALIGN(x,a)				\
	({					\
		typeof(x) _a = (a);		\
		((x) + _a - 1) & ~(_a - 1);	\
	})
but that won't compile because of <net/neighbour.h>:
	unsigned char		ha[ALIGN(MAX_ADDR_LEN, sizeof(unsigned long))];
gcc says:
/scratch/Ksrc/linux-merge/include/net/neighbour.h:104: error: braced-group within expression allowed only inside a function
I guess that could be fixed by changing that declaration but now this
is starting to feel like early 2.6.20 material.
