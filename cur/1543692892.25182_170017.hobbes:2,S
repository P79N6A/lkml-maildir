Not really - that is why they have been external for several years.

The LSM is part of the kernel. Any/most enhanced security modules may be
loaded without patching the core. Second, it is possible to alter some
modules policy on the fly for an additional control.

Not directly relevent, though it is for maintenance.

No. It completely disallows those applications (ie, grid, legion, and any
other distributed application) from functioning for general users. Since
these users choice of application is generally unknown, you would also
have to generate a group of ports dynamically.
Also, since group membership is controling ACCESS functions, you end up
sharing more than what you want. Your purpose is to have "group" apply to
port access, yet "group" also applies to file access. You REALLY don't
want to mix these.

Application porting compatabiltiy. Right now all that is necessary is to
recompile the application. With the patch, you also have to figure out how
to apply appropriate ports to the application, and you don't know ahead
of time how many ports to allocate. Grid applications tend to have one
port for each node they communicate with. If two users generate a 5 way
connection you have to give two sets of groups... If the user then wants
a 10 way you have to reallcate again.
This is insufficent flexibility. What you want is to tie each port to a
capability (or tie port allocation to a capability) and then grant the user
the capability to allocate ports. This really calls for a LSM based module
that can pass the request to a security daemon to permit/deny port allocation
based on external rules.
This would be more flexable, maintainable, and is less intrusive of the
kernel core.
