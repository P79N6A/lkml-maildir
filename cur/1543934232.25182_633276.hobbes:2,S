Thinking about this, my main worry about 0xf0 as a 0x80 replacement would be 
systems that have elected to _not_ let port 0xf0 writes flow through to ISA 
changing the timing-characteristics. Given that it's a known port, someone 
may have elected to just keep it fully internal.
Upto now the datasheets I've read do put it on ISA...
