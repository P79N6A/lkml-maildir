Hi.
Many were kind enough to make comments, all of which are welcomed. To
reduce traffic, I've shoved the text, now modified, on
http://www.billabong.demon.co.uk/computing/press_release.html
Of course, anything there is only a suggestion. I'm not a distributor, so
I won't personally be passing it around, but if anyone wants to take any
part of it, they're welcome. In particular, comments seen on the kernel
mailing list will be read and applied if they seem ok to me.
