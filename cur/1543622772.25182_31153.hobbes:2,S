That's a good solution in the general case but doesn't work for
some of the proc entries that already exist.  cpuinfo, for example.
There seem to be a number of niche /proc methods already.  A cache-on-open
method would be very useful for files like cpuinfo and a number of other
files for PPC.
It sure would make accessing /proc files less whacky for user-code.

} fd private data. You can recover that and free it on release. It could
} even be a buffer holding the actual "content"
