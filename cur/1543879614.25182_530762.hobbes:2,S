yeah, good question. Yesterday i did a quick testboot with that too, and 
it seemed to behave pretty OK with the low-res [jiffies based] 
sched_clock() too. Although in that case things are much more of an 
approximation and rounding/arithmetics artifacts are possible. CFS works 
best with a high-resolution cycle counter.
