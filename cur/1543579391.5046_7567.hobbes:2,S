Read the Linux CodingStyle.
Tabs are 8 characters. They are NOT adjustable. Never have been, never
will be. Anybody who thinks tabs are anything but 8 chars apart is just
wrong. It's that simple.
And two spaces is not enough. If you write code that needs comments at
the end of a line, your code is crap. It's that easy. There is _never_ a
reason to comment a single line, and multi-line comments the the right
of multi-line code to the left is a recipe for disaster. In short, you
don't do comments to the right of code - you do them _before_ code.
