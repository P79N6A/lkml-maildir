	That's an interesting argument. I think you could argue that a BK
repository is an aggregation of metadata and the kernel source, and
therefore only the kernel source needs to be distributed. IANAL, this
question has now gotten into territory in which I don't feel comfortable
offering an opinion.
	As for the 'preferred form' argument, I think an argument can be made that
the source itself is the preferred form of the work for the purpose of
making modifications to it. One uses the BK repository to *get* the
preferred form. Again, though, one could argue the other side of this --
that it's preferred to have the metadata to make the modifications.
