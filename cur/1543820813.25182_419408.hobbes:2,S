My preference is for a clone/unshare flag.
My second preference would be a new syscall that simply
creates the interface.
The important point is that we have something that works
and solves the subset of the problem we are working on.

This is a key point.  We are not in prototype stage.
Linux-Vserver, OpenVZ and other less polished implementations
work have already provided that.
Where we are now is implementing well understood subsets of the
problem in a way that everyone can use.
So all that really matters is an interface that is good enough
for the current subset.
Since each subset of the problem can stand on it's own we
can give it a very thorough technical review.
