You don't need to mention _all_ compatible devices in
the "compatible" property, only the few that matter;
typically the oldest one, and sometimes some intermediate
device that has extra features over the original one.
It isn't useful to add "compatible" entries that no OS
probes for.

You *definitely* should put the device name for _this_
device in there, in case it needs some special workaround.

That can be used as the "base" name, yes.
