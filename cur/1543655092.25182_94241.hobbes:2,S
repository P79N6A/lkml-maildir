Ok, acpi_wakeup.S is only for S3.
As for drivers, I'm dubious of swsusp's handling of device and driver
support. A suspend cycle is supposed to leave devices in the same state
they were in before the cycle.  So, you need suspend and resume hooks in
the drivers, even for S4 support, to capture and restore context in the
devices themselves. Then again, I've no proof that swsusp doesn't get 
everything right as is.

Then break it up into separate files in a separate directory.

I know, and that's fine. I won't touch CVS again, unless there's a hefty 
sum and a lot of good beer involved. (Or, after I've consumed a lot of 
good beer). Patches can be made from the repo, most easily after merging 
to a new kernel version.
