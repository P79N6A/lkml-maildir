Hi!
 I am trying to build an new backend for SANE.
 The SANE docs say, that it is recommended to increase sg-big-buf.
 Ok, I thought, an changed /usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h to
 look like:
  /*#define SG_BIG_BUFF SG_SCATTER_SZ*/       /* mcc:off for backward compatibility */
  #define SG_BIG_BUFF (SG_SCATTER_SZ * 8) /* =256KB, if you want mcc */
(last lines of that file...)
 and recompiled the kernel, install it and rebooted.
 A cat /proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buf shows me 32kByte nevertheless.
 ?
 What I am doing wrong?
 I expspected too see something like 256kByte...
 Thank you very much in advance for any hint...
 May the Pengo be with you!
 Meino
