  I really wish you folks had better sense than sending any nasty letters,
  or for that matter, REACTING AT ALL, when somebody does loop messages
  from their mailbox-client to unintended destinations.  Especially you,
  Aaron.. (Well, *you* can react by doing filtering at linux-kernel, but
  that is an off-line discussion topic between you and me.)
  Due to the "little" burst of "junk", and "reactions", VGER had a queue
  of several *thousand* messages to handle, and it took a while to process
  them -- even with me manually scrubbing several of the messages, and
  heaps of reactions...  Now the queue is back to zero.
  I bet you sent the nastygrams to   linux-users@linux.or.jp,  which list
  has NOTHING to do with this case (aside of being place where the messages
  were sent 4 months ago.)  The little I know of Japanese culture, I do
  suggest you send an apology letter to those innocent addresses you likely
  have offended.
  I do know the real culprit source address, but these reactions you people
  have shown, does suggest to me that I should not reveal it aside of very
  few selected people..
