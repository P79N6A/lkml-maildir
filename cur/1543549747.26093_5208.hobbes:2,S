So you have a "pre-allocation allocator"?  Leads to interesting and hard to detect
bugs with old code that does not pre-allocate or with code that incorrectly pre-allocates
or that blocks on something unrelated
           preallocte 20 pages
           get first
           ask for an inode -- block waiting for an inode
or
           preallocate 20 pages
           if(checkuserpath())return -ENOWAY; /* stranding my pre-allocate */
           else get them pages
What's nice about these is they don't cause errors on test and seem more 
difficult to spot than looking for cases where allocated memory gets stranded.
Doesn't the alloc_vec method seem simpler to you?

I like ENOMEM anyways.
