Agreed.

I think it would be better to add ATA_FLAG_FUA instead of ATA_FLAG_NO_FUA.

Not enabling FUA doesn't result in huge performance hit.  I'm not sure 
whether we should go such far.  Just supporting FUA on known good 
controllers sounds good enough to me.

Yeah, I don't think we need to be too careful about blacklisting NCQ 
considering the sorry state of many early NCQ firmwares.  Please submit 
a patch.  It would be nice if you add a comment why the drives are added 
for documentation.
Thanks.
