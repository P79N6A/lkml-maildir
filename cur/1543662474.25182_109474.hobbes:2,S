Have you taken a look at valgrind? (

It is a free software x86 JIT. I don't think it supports 16bit code currently,
but it probably wouldn't be too difficult to add. It wasn't primarily designed
for speed - its main application is to instrument programs - but its slowdown
compared to running on the real CPU is moderate and its certainly fast enough
for anything designed to run on DoS.
