Well that's clever of you :)  According to google, only
one other person has ever hit this with ext3.  Several
people have hit it on ext2.  It does appear to be related
to I/O errors on the underlying device.
Could you please force a fsck against that filesystem and
also check you logs for any disk I/O warnings.
