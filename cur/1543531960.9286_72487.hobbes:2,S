The only time it would fail is if you exceeded your memory quota. Not because
someone else is using memory. If login limits are also used then you would not
have been able to login to start a measure (also applies to cron/batch).

Went through this during UNICOS MLS class -
1) An allocation can only fail if it is over the users quota, therefore no
   information other than "over quota".
2) If you are not over quota and you fail then the system is overcommitted.
   (This is where UNICOS allows a deadlock rather than allow the abort, I think
   IRIX does the same, but I haven't worked with trusted IRIX enough to know)
3) A covert channel only exists if there are a limited number of processes
   active in the overcommitted system and some of those processes are at an
   elevated security level. After that, the noise level rises reducing the
   bit transfer rate to something that has been considered acceptable and is
   monitored ("considered accptable" is defined by local management).
#1 is the key to eliminating the covert channel.
#2 allows the covert channel, but allowing deadlock of all lower security
   level processes eliminates all information but "somthing ran".
#3 is the covert channel you are referring to, and the noise level rises
   rapidly as the total number of processes exceeds 30-50.
BTW, there are more covert channels (and faster ones too) than memory signals -
Process counts
CPU load	 - this is a really hard one to close.
I/O rates	 - only closed by not allowing the rates to be visible
network bandwith
Batch job counts
context switching rates
disk capacity/file sizes/access times
Have I overlooked something?
