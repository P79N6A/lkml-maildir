True, but IMO the majority of people aren't using kbuild with 2.4 yet.
Plus the fact that kbuild isn't included in 2.4 - I'm thinking of the
newbie/more-than-casual user who just wants to a) grab vanilla, b) run the
provided treelink scripts to drop in their second kernel.  Patching the
kernel with kbuild 2.5 would be a bit too intrusive for this.
Marcelo, can these scripts go into 2.4?
