But they are exactly that.

There are three ways caps can deal with virtualization.
First, we can stick with the idea that a child process inherits
capabilities from the parent.  In that case, while starting up a child
container, we give the init process the caps we want it to have (i.e.
perhaps we just don't give it CAP_NET_ADMIN).  It can then dole those
out as usual, and it's children then can't regain the others.  Problem
is setuid binaries are a special case.  Though if we implement fs caps,
we could then put a max_caps limit on the fs caps for a vfsmount.
Second, we can actually create a separate capabilities namespace  :)
Sounds silly, but when you consider that you're recommending passing
several namespaces into capable() to have some magic calculation
performed on them, maybe it's not so bad.  This way, an suid binary
ends up with just the capabilities specified in the namespace.
Third is to do what you suggest below.  Fortunately that's easy enough
to experiment with, since we can just define a new capability_virt LSM.
I don't think any of the capable calls need to be extended, since we can
grab the namespace pointers needed from the task_struct->nsproxy's.
IMO, capabilities are already complicated past the point of danger, and
the solution keeping things simplest is the second.  Since capabilities
are an LSM, the namespace creation and configuration would likely be
done differently from other namespace, i.e. through a securityfs
interface.
This is of course something which could fit under the security/LSM
portion of the containers topic at ksummit...  Along with the uid/keys
discussion.

But this gets away from the idea of capabilities being an inherited set
of privileges independent of uid.  Really it should be file
capabilities, not (set)uid, which have the ability subsequently raise
caps.
Of course few people love capabilities, so maybe that would actually be
preferred...
