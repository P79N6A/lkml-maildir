The difference is exactly 4096 bytes, i.e. 1 whole page.  Seems like an
off-by-one error somewhere in the file access or page cache code.
It would be interesting to know whether the read is truncated or whether
the write is truncated.  So could you tell us what is returned by:
cat testfile | wc -c
Also your .config would probably be helpful.
Best regards,
