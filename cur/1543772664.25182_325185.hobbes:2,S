Oops, sorry, I took my grub conf and edited the bad entry :
title 2.6.12-rc6
#kernel (hd0,2)/bzImage-2.6.12-rc6 root=/dev/sdc2 parport=auto video=vesafb:mtrr,ywrap,1024x800-16@75 vga=0xF07
kernel (hd0,2)/bzImage-2.6.12-rc5 root=/dev/sdc2 parport=auto video=vesafb:mtrr,ywrap,1024x800-16@75 vga=0xF07 console=ttyS0
to take the second option with the "console=ttyS0" and forgot to update
it to (hd0,2)/bzImage-2.6.12-rc6.
Sorry for it, I can reboot my computer at 9pm (vdr is reccording till
9pm) and then I post the result :)
And don't worry, it's a vanilla 2.6.12-rc6 with only the scsi-misc and
the last patch, I even didn't patch for latest DVB.
