Hi there, guys.
I was wondering, has anyone out there made a port of
exec-shield-2.4.22-G4 for 2.4.22-rmap15k ? If so, is
it available anywhere?
I'm about to upgrade a couple of boxes, and I'd really
love to be able to use them together, but exec-shield
applied on top of rmap gives a couple of rejects I'm
not sure how to resolve by hand.
Thanks for any pointers you might have.
Regards,
//kj
