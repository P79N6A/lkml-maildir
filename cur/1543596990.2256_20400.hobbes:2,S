Right, that's the problem I was trying to fix. Basically it was unable to 
send small packets, because the padding was disabled and it would only 
get enabled if the card negotiated a connection other than 100-HD.

Ok. Can you send me the other stuff the driver prints, especially the line 
speed/duplex detection?
Also, if you feel adventurous, search for these lines in the driver:
        /* Configure the PCI bus bursts and FIFO thresholds. */
        np->tx_mode = 0x0C04;           /* modified when link is up. */
*       writel(0x8000 | np->tx_mode, ioaddr + TxMode);
*       writel(np->tx_mode, ioaddr + TxMode);
and comment out those two marked with a *. At that point you should have 
essentially the 2.4.6 driver, so see if they behaves similarly.
I'll also test it myself when I get home.
Thanks,
Ion
