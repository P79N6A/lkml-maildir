See, there is an ego problem, too.  If you rewrite my code, it means
you're better than I am.  Rejected.
Features win over efficiency.  Seriously, look at glibc.  Hav eyou ever
tried to fix a bug in it?  Holy CRAP is that horrible code.  Each chunk of
code itself is OK (though it abuses macrso so thoroughly I hesitate to
call it C code).  But it tried to support every architecture x every OS.
You know what?  I don't CARE if the glibc code compiles on HPUX or not.
HPUX has it's own libc.

From-scratch is a huge risk.  But yeah, sometimes it has to be.

Never gonna happen.
