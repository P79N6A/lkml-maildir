 Well, the question is whether the timer->INTIN0 routing is hardwired
inside the nforce2 chipset or is it external and thus board-dependent.  
Any way to get this clarified by the chipset's manufacturer?

 With real hardware perhaps it can be debugged.  The interaction between
the 8254, the 8259As and the APICs seems interesting in the chipset.  
Perhaps the override to INTIN2 is to tell the timer is really unavailable
directly?  I can't see a way to have an ACPI override that specifies an
ISA interrupt is not connected to the I/O APIC (unlike with the MPS).
