From the original report:
"I am using ftrace to get a detailed timing analysis of the resume process 
on the OLPC XO laptop and am seeing that when we start running again, the
system timestamep is not being updated for several (hundreds of) thousands 
of cycles (~2000 ftrace entries). From following the ftrace, what is 
happening is that the clocksource is not updated until we run the cpu_idle() 
thread due to an explicit scheduling operation in the resume path that occurs 
via call to msleep from pci_set_power_state()."
That's what I was referring to.
Thanks,
