        is it correct that this failing kernel didnt have the RAID patch applied?
        for the record:
My (similar, single, but rather immediate) failure happened on a
kernel without RAID patch (and without RAID enabled) at all.
Once I removed '-mcpu=i686 -O6' from
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -mcpu=i686 -O6 -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
(where gcc = 2.95.1)
the new kernel runs fine.
