Current status on the four patches:
1) dasd ioctl patch didn't compile (missing semicolon after
lock_kernel()) and doesn't work after fixing the compile problem. It's a
problem with the bdev->bd_disk->private_data which is NULL at the time
the partition detection code calls the BIODASDINFO and HDIO_GETGEO ioctl
with ioctl_by_bdev. I don't see an easy way to fix this right now.
2) fs3270 ioctl patch is fine. Fullscreen test works after fixing the
independent class_device_create problem (NULL argument missing, patch
will follow).
3) remove TIOCGSERIAL/TIOCSSERIAL patch. Fine with me. 
4) tape ioctl patch. Not yet sure about this one. Need to ask Stefan
Bader.
