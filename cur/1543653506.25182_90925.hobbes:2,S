Correct, the patch is in 2.4-ac, and I'll send it to Marcelo for 2.4.21.
How many concurrent processes are running? Each thread that is linked 
against libpthread consumes 64 kB vmalloc space, and on SMP you have 
around 96 MB vmalloc space. I'd expect OOM at 1500 threads.
With the fix applied, no vmalloc space is needed for libpthread.
