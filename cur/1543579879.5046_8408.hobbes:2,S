Subject: How to determine what driver belongs to eth0 (ethX)?

I'm trying to write a server that is able to run specific
diags against various ethernet drivers, knowing only the
interface name (ie eth0).
Can anyone think of a reasonably easy way to tell what driver
 (and thus what diag-code), to run against a particular interface?
This information is spit out at boot time, but processing the dmesg
log is almost too much of a hack for me to bear!!
These are the values I'm currently planning on probing and setting:
Link Speed (10/100, full/half, auto-negotiate)
After these are satisfied, then other things can be added as desired.
Thanks,
Ben
