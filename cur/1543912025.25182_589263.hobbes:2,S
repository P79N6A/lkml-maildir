socket_sock_rcv_skb() is a hook for enqueue time.
I want a hook for dequeue time, because what TOMOYO Linux is doing is
not "whether a socket created by foo is permitted to pick up
an incoming packet from specific address/port"
but "whether bar is permitted to pick up
an incoming packet from specific address/port".
At the time of enqueue, I can't know who will pick up that packet.
Same reason for socket_post_accept(). What TOMOYO Linux is doing is
not "whether a socket created by foo is permitted to accept
a connection request from specific address/port"
but "whether bar is permitted to accept
a connection request from specific address/port".
At the time of enqueue, I can't know who will pick up that request.
