    Pretty hard to type if shift is stuck...
Ah, not so pessimistic!
(In the console & keyboard HOWTO I describe how to get out of
raw mode without disturbing the hack games of the other users -
essentially by first starting X. And lo! X is also easy to type
with a stuck shift key.
And there are so many other ways out - paste using selection
or gpm for example, or just logging in via net or serial line, ...)
