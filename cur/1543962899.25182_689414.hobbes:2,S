Well, this seems the only patch that overrides basic context of the
arguments.  (Or, we have already "flags" argument for other APIs
that do not require new API.)
To me, it seems overriding 2nd argument is a too ad-hoc workaround,
and introducing new syscalls with flags is cleaner, e.g.,
    psocket(family, socktype, protocol, flags);
    psocketpair(d, type, protocol, int sv[2], flags);
