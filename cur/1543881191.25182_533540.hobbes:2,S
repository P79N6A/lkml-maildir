Note that this also stands against a full kthread conversion.
Marcel put my old patches for a full kthread conversion in, but
they didn't deal properly with some of the premaure exit cases,
and causes OOPSes.
I don't remember what the problems where, but the case of a thread
terminating earlier and possibly asynchronously is one of the
cases we'll probably have to add to the kthread infrastructure
before all uses of kernel_thread in drivers can be converted.
