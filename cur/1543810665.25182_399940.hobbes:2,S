It was changed as there would be more than one "block" symlink in a
device's directory if more than one block device was attached to a
single struct device.  For example, ub and multi-lun devices (there were
other reports of this happening for scsi devices too at the time from
what I remember.)
So, in that case, your tool would have been broken anyway, so this fix
was required to make it correct :)
The fix was to make block devices work the same way as all other class
devices, which had this fix a while ago.
