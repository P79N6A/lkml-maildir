That's true, that sequence point makes sure e.g. all side effects such as
pre-{dec,inc}rement on the arguments happen before the call.
But as I said, no sequence point demands any particular ordering of
evaluation of the LHS and RHS of +=.

That's different, there is a sequence point at the end of the first operand
of &&, ||, ?: and , operators (second bullet in ISO C99 Annex C).
