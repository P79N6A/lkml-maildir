I tried to get these on top of Jeff's current devel tree but gave up at
ata-acpi-pata-methods when things got really sticky.
So you're rather between a rock and a hard place here.  Perhaps it would be
better for you to continue development on top of Jeff's devel tree, and to
distribute a copy of git-libata-all.patch along with your patches to your
testers.
Of course, that puts them on the bleeding edge when all they want to do is
to get their power management working, so that's not really suitable
either.
