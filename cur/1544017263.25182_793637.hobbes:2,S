What do you mean by "No it doesn't". It does exactly what i claimed it 
does.

How do difficulties of dynamic percpu-alloc make my above suggestion 
unsuitable for SNMP stats in networking? Most of those stats are not 
dynamically allocated - they are plain straightforward percpu variables.
Plus the majority of percpu usage is static - just like the majority of 
local variables is static, not dynamic. So any percpu-alloc complication 
is a non-issue.

The generic versions will not be used on 95%+ of the active Linux systems 
out there, as they run on x86. If you worry about the remaining 5%, those 
can be optimized too.

But local_t does not actually solve this problem at all - because one 
still has to have per-cpu-ness.

In reality local_t has almost zero users in the kernel - despite being 
with us at least since v2.6.12. That pretty much tells us all about its 
utility.
The thing is, local_t without proper percpu integration is a toothless 
tiger in the jungle. And our APIS do exactly that kind of integration and 
i expect them to be more popular than local_t. There's already a dozen 
usage sites of it in arch/x86.
