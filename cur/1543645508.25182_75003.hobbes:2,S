Can you stick a printk in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c in the function
init_intel    
Just before:                         
        /* look up this descriptor in the table */
stick
        printk("Cache info byte: %02X\n", des);
that will dump the cache info out of the CPU as the kernel scans it and
should let us find the error in the table.
