Note that the generic list structure already has support for "batching".
It only does it for multiple adds right now (see the "list_splice"
merging code), but there is nothing to stop people from doing it for
multiple deletions too. The code is something like
	static inline void list_remove_between(x,y)
	{
		n->next = y;
		y->prev = x;
	}
and notice how it's still just two unconditional stores for _any_ number
of deleted entries.
Anyway, I've already applied your #2, how about a patch relative to that?
