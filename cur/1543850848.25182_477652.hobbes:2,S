Yeah, doing a grep does seem to imply that there is no way that those 
changes could matter.
Michael, can you double-check? I think Jun'ichi is right - in your kernel, 
according to the config posted on bugzilla, I don't think there should be 
a single caller of bd_claim_by_disk, since CONFIG_MD is disabled.
So it does seem strange. But if you bisected to that patch, and it 
reliably does _not_ have problems with the patch reverted, maybe there is 
some strange preprocessor thing that makes "grep" not find the caller.
Michael, you also reported:

(where that "d7dd8f.." is actually missing the initial "4" - I think you 
cut-and-pasted things incorrectly). 
So I wonder.. You still had ACPI working _after_ the kernel build even 
with that patch in place, and it seems that suspend/resume is the real 
issue. Martin Lorenz reports on the same bugzilla entry, and he only has 
problems with suspend/resume.
I assume that "compile the kernel" just triggers some magic ACPI event 
(probably fan-related due to heat), and I wonder if the bisection faked 
you out because once you get "close enough" the differences are small 
enough that the kernel compile is quick and the heat event doesn't 
actually trigger?
See what I'm saying? Maybe the act of bisecting itself changed the 
results, and then when you just revert the patch, you end up in the same 
situation: you only recompile a small part (you only recompile that 
particular file), and the problem doesn't occur, so you'd think that the 
revert "fixed" it.
If it's heat-related, it should probably trigger by anything that does a 
lot of CPU (and perhaps disk) accesses, not just kernel builds. It might 
be good to try to find another test-case for it than a kernel recompile, 
one that doesn't depend on how much changed in the kernel..
