My guess is that most of this test fits inside that huge cache of
yours, making it run much faster than on my system.  You probably need
to increase the number of clients to get comparable results.
When you say just like SCHED_FIFO, do you mean completely clean?  Or
are you still getting unexplained xruns?  If that's the case, we need
to figure out why and eliminate them.
The reason I can measure an effect here is that the test is heavy
enough to stress my system and the system is RT-clean enough for
SCHED_FIFO to work properly.  (That's no surprise, I've been running
it that way for years.)

I don't mind.  It's the main way I can help.  I just get busy some of
the time.
It did work better.  On the first run, there were a couple of real bad
xruns starting up.  But, the other two runs look fairly clean.

With a compile running, bad xruns and really long delays become a
serious problem again.

+compile
Comparing the summary statistics with the 90% run, suggests that the
same problems occur in both cases, but not as often at 100%.
  
http://www.joq.us/jack/benchmarks/.SUMMARY
With these latency demands, the system can't ever pick the wrong
thread on exit from even a single interrupt, or we're screwed.  I am
pretty well convinced this is not happening reliably (except with
SCHED_FIFO).
