I still read dirty_highmem as:
/proc/sys/vm/do-account-highmem-in-dirty-memory-calculations
... so we're still talking one negative apart!

Well, the particular piece of kernel behaviour is already a negative:
 "decrease the amount of memory allowed to get dirty so we never dirty
  more than a percentage of available lowmem"
So what this flag is saying is:
 "DON'T decrease the amount of memory allowed to get dirty down to just
  the lowmem - dirty a percentage of total available including highmem"
As Linus said - the alternative of allowing more than 100% of lowmem
to be dirty is just plain too wierd, hence this approach of allowing
an option to turn off the new restriction that appeared since 2.6.16.

No, that's not true.  The whole point is that between 2.6.16 and
2.6.20 the kernel behaviour changed.  It currently doesn't count
highmem in dirty memory calculations, which is why the memory pressure
appears to be so great when actually there's still 4Gb of unused
memory in the box.
/proc/sys/vm/do-account-highmem-in-dirty-memory-calculations would
default to "false" to get the current behaviour post-2.6.16 kernels.
Setting a flag to make it true would stop the kernel subtracting 
highmem from the available count, giving the "old" behaviour of
allowing a percentage of all the memory in the system to be dirty
before forcing writeback.

I've spent a while thinking about this, and looking at the code.
I think this might be slightly clearer:
/proc/sys/vm/highmem_is_dirtyable - defaults to false
Here's how it would look in the code:
static unsigned long determine_dirtyable_memory(void)
{
        unsigned long x;
        x = global_page_state(NR_FREE_PAGES)
                + global_page_state(NR_INACTIVE)
                + global_page_state(NR_ACTIVE);
        if (!vm_highmem_is_dirtyable)
                x -= highmem_dirtyable_memory(x);
        return x + 1; /* Ensure that we never return 0 */
}
I think that's very clear.
"Unless highmem is dirtyable, subtract the otherwise dirtyable
 pages from the total dirtyable memory count if they are in
 highmem"
Or without negatives:
"If highmem is dirtyable then include highmem pages in the
 total dirtyable memory count"
Unfortunately this isn't expressed without negatives in the
code because it's easier (I presume without looking at all the
different zones on a cruddy piece of old i386) to add up the 
total and remove the pages in the HIGHMEM zone than to add up
all the non-HIGHMEM zones separately.
Does that suit you?  Does my explaination make sense?
Would you like me to re-submit the patch based on this?  I'm
certainly not happy with dirty_highmem as it is now in mm
because it looks backwards and unclear to me.
