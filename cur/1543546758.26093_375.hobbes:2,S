And in include/asm-sparc64/fcntl.h, we have
struct flock {
	short l_type;
	short l_whence;
	off_t l_start;
	off_t l_len;
	pid_t l_pid;
	short __unused;
};
...
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define flock64 flock
#endif
This definition for flock64 was also introduced in the test7-patch.
I reused it for the ia64-architecture fcntl.h in my patch.
On a 64 bit plattform there most probably are alignment problems with the
struct.
