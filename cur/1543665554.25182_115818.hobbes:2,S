I am using rivafb with 2.5.64-bk2 kernel and with latest fbdev patches
and have following (minor) problems:
* switching to X and back ruins the colours totally. Soulution is to
fbset back to default mode. (I've even made hotkey for that ;-) )
* changing modes(to other than 640x480) will change the resolution but
not the 'console window' itself. That is - I have 640x480 window on the
corner for text console but actually 800x600 resolution. (Maybe it is a
feature? How to get it full-screened, anyway?)
* changing modes on one tty (even though -a was specified with fbset)
will not change modes on other ttys. When switching ttys with different
resolution, the screen blanks and I again have to use my hotkey to fbset
back to default resolution.
* using cat /dev/fb1 will produce kernel NULL pointer :-)
Oh.. and one quick question.. docs are talking about 'nice large console
without using tiny, unreadable fonts'. How to archieve that?
