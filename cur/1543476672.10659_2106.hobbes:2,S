> 0.90 seems to work very well unless you have a VIA chipset. 
I've got a machine with a VIA 82C585 chipset running 2.0.36 with tulip
0.90 that refuses to get along with a LiteOn 82c168 PNIC chip. I also have
a DEC 21140 that was originally in the machine. When I have them both in,
either sharing IRQ's or not sharing, both cards stop working. Any idea
what to do with it?
