I also have workloads that would die with 4:4 and rmap.
the question is if they tested this in the stock 2.4 or 2.4-aa VM, or if
this was tested on kernels with rmap.
most kernels are also broken w.r.t. lowmem reservation, there are huge
vm design breakages in tons of 2.4 out there, those breakages would
generate lomwm shortages too, so just saying the 8G box runs out of
lowmem is meaningless unless we know exactly which kind of 2.4
incarnation was running on that box.
For istance google was running out of lowmem zone even on 2.5G boxes
until I fixed it, and the fix was merged in mainline only around 2.4.23,
so unless I'm sure all relevant fixes were applied the 8G runs out of
lowmem means nothing to me, since it was running out of lowmem for me
too for ages even on the 4G boxes until I've fixed all those issues in
the vm, not related to the pinned amount of memory.
alternatively if they can count the number of tasks, and the number of
files open, we  can do the math and count the mbytes of lowmem pinned,
that as well can demonstrate it was a limitation of the 3:1 and not a
design bug of the vm in-use on that box.
