It has been found and the policy people already know about it.  I'm not
sure what the upstream status of the fixed policy is should appear soon.
(I also talked with the X people and apparently this is unfixable on
i686.  ajax posted about this on the original thread)
There is another bug however which I have a patch but haven't tested
much, I'll try to get it out today.  If you use a hint > 0 but <
mmap_min_addr without map fixed you will likely be denied.  Simple fix,
change hints up to mmap_min_addr if they are too low.
