1. thanks for the quick reply.
2. thanks for cc:ing me directly; I forgot to ask that when I posted
3. I would love to provide any debugging output, but don't know how. 
Please be more specific.  A pointer to the proper FAQ will suffice.
There is is no discernable error message: at least not to console or to 
/var/log/messages.  It just stops sending or receiving.
