Hello all,
this is what git bisect told me about the problem:
jpo@jpo-laptop:~/linux-2.6$ git bisect good
4fd06960f120e02e9abc802a09f9511c400042a5 is first bad commit

    Use the new x86 setup code for i386
    This patch hooks the new x86 setup code into the Makefile machinery.  It
    also adapts boot/tools/build.c to a two-file (as opposed to three-file)
    universe, and simplifies it substantially.

You'll have to contact Digital Logic and have them check with the BIOS vendor
to see if the fix was made in that version or not.  I don't have that
particular board, so I can't try out the fixes here.
I'm still trying to track down the particulars of the fix from the BIOS 
vendor.  I'll let you know.

Sure - you might as well - just to make sure its the same problem.
