Well, it happened quiet a few times that I started some perlscript
parsing a few GB of data and forgot to add some progress counter.
When after an hour of processing the script still has not stopped, I'd
like to see how much it processed so that I can estimate how long I
still have to wait and if it is worthwhile to stop the script for
optimalisations and such.
