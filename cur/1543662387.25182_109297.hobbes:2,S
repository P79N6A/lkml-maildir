Longhaul yes, Longrun no. On longrun you can't set the speed to a specific
frequency[*], only to a _frequency range_. So the frequency table helpers
aren't needed there. Also, for gx-suspmod, which allows really fine-grained
setting of frequencies, the frequency table helpers don't make sense.

So, even when the conversion is complete, there are two drivers which can be
compiled. Additionally, some users (or distros!) might prefer modularizing
this.

[*] you can set policy->max = policy->min, but that really doesn't make
sense on longrun.
