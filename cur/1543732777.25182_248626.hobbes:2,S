Since most people will search the LKML for drivers I'll post this little 
notice so people can find it.
The Winbond W83L519D SD/MMC card reader found in many of HP/Compaq's 
laptops (x1000, nx7000, nx7010, etc.) can now be used in Linux. The 
driver is still in its early stages and not ready for inclusion in the 
main kernel. But for those brave enough to fiddle around the driver can 
do both reads and writes. The only known problem is that it doesn't like 
some cards (they do not get past the init. so no risk of data loss).
