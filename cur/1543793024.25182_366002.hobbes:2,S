That's getting us closer.
Would you be able to revert the git-netdev-all.patch changes in e100.c?  To
do that, take the drivers/net/e100.c from 2.6.14+linus.patch and simply
overwrite the e100.c in 2.6.14-mm2 with it.
Or, prepare a 2.6.14-mm2 tree and use
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/e100.c,
 which amounts to
the same thing.
Thanks.
