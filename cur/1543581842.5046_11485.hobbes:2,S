 is a driver
for the touch screen used on the Cassiopia Fiva MPC-501 pen computer. It
is a rather Bad Hack (seeing as it was built rather blindly to mimic the
behaviour of the Windows driver, and has IRQ/port hardcoded in), but it
works for me with the 2.2.16 kernel.
The device outputs 5 byte packets - 1 status byte, 2 bytes each for X & Y
coordinates. The devel branch of GTK+ has support for /dev/fidmour in the
Linux framebuffer backend (gtk+/gdk/linux-fb/gdkmouse-fb.c), should you
wish to see a code sample.
I'm wondering if anyone has a resource that would provide information on
porting this driver to the 2.4 kernel.
I would welcome comments on this driver, or on the MPC-501 and Linux in
general. Bonus points to anyone who actually understands why the driver
works and how the hardware works. :)
Hope this helps,
