The reason I was so suspicious of the problem being at our (Linux) end, is
because you can reach the site no problem from the masq/firewall box; just
not from the clients.  I was also suspicious because such a large number of
sites have this problem (though I've since learned not to underestimate the
potential for mass ignorance. ;) The masq box and the clients are both
reaching the outside through the same interface and MTU (obviously).  The
problem only occurs with the client.  I could be mistaken, but IIRC the
dumps showed the masq'd client's SYN go out and hit the target, and the
target response come back and hit the firewall.  I don't know enough about
tcpdump output to see why the response wasn't demasq'd and returned to the
client.  I'm no longer using a modem for Internet access, so I can't test
it anymore.
