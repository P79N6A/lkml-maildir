I think you missed the point. If you don't know that the "Memory Split"
submenu is hidden unless you enable EMBEDDED && EXPERIMENTAL and are
!X86_PAE (the latter was the problem here, until I applied your patch),
then this is not helpful. You'll do what I did, and search for VMSPLIT
in menuconfig and get the results I pasted in my first mail, which as I
said then are less than helpful.

Right, I gathered as much...

And that's what I had Roman and Sam on the Cc, as I wanted their input
if this was a worthwhile change.
