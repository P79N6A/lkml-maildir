You can also erase the drive firmware as a user etc. That's the problem.
When you fix that cdrecord gets broken by the security fix if you are
using the SG_IO interface. Patches are kicking around to try and sort
things out so cd burning is safe as non-root. cdrecord works as root.
As a security fix it was sufficiently important that it had to be done.
