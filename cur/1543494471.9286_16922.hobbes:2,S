Hello  friends,
I'm puzzled by the following:
Comp1, [P133} dualboot W95/Linux 2.0.36 (all are intel machines)
Comp2, [486-33] Linux 2.0.36
Comp3, [K6-233] Linux 2.2.[0..7] has probes for NE2000 clone and
Etherworks DE205AC
If Comp3 is equipped with NE2000 card all network traffic (coax) is ok.
Printing from Comp1(W95) thru Samba on Comp3 works well. Ftp between all
three machines (Linux) goes well (500-1100 kB/sec). NFS serving (Comp3) to
both others without problem.
If Comp3 is is equipped with DE205AC card things are different. Telnet
between Comp3 and both others works but stalls if a long directory is
listed. Ftp from Comp3 to Comp2 and getting a file of about 460 kB
(vmlinuz) stalls after 2 to 20K of transfer. 'ps axl' shows that Comp3 is
in tcp_recvmsg. Cat /proc/net/tcp on Comp2 show retransm = 1 or 2.
TCPdump shows packets between the machines with the last xfer from Comp3
to Comp1 per cycle. The time between pairs of packets is several seconds.
Printing from Comp1(W95) opens the data pipe for Samba but transmits never
any data....
 
As said before: If Comp3 has the NE2000 (clone) all problems vanish, but
the Etherworks is a faster card... I can trigger all problems just by
swapping the networks cards.
Any suggestion or hints where to look deeper into the problem is welcome.
