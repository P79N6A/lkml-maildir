The reason I proposed my ideas for tying the two values together is 
that I am
concerned about breaking existing code.  I have several binaries to 
which the
source has been lost but I would like to have them continue to properly 
adjust
their priorities internally.  On the other hand, I have other programs 
that I am
currently writing where I would like to be able to have separate IO and 
CPU
priorities.  I believe that we could have two values yet preserve 
backwards
compatibility if we derive the effective IO priority from the sum or 
the provided
IO and CPU priority values, or something along those lines.  That way 
any
program not knowing about the new syscall could just nice() and get both
values adjusted.  If a parent program ran "ioprio()" beforehand to 
adjust the
ioprio with respect to the nice value, then that balance would be 
maintained.
