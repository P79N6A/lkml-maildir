OK, I will do.  I thought M41ST94 also can be supported but that was
wrong.  From datasheets, the driver can be used for M41T8[0123],
M41ST8[457] chips.

I will do.

I will do.

It is required by platform code to provide SQW setting.  Also
M41TXX_DRV_NAME and M41TXX_I2C_ADDR might be useful to declare
i2c_board_info, which would be something like:
	static struct m41txx_platform_data pdata = {
		.sqw_freq = M41TXX_SQW_32KHZ,
	};
	static struct i2c_board_info binfo __initdata = {
		I2C_BOARD_INFO(M41TXX_DRV_NAME, M41TXX_I2C_ADDR),
		.type = "m41t80",
		.platform_data = &pdata,
	};
	return i2c_register_board_info(0, &binfo, 1);

Thank you for review.
