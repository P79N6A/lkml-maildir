What about if you want to use fb when in text mode (Because you get 
200x75 on a 1600x1200 screen) AND run DRI because the rest of the time 
you want to run fast 3D. Plus you want to be able to CTRL-ALT-F1/F2/F7 
back & forth between X & fb... (i.e. how I currently use it but with 
unaccelerated x.org radeon drivers, becaus ethe 3D ones WON'T play nicely).
Currently this fails to work... Presumably because the fb & DRI code 
(fglrx here BTW) don't talk to each other & so the display gets garbled 
if you're lucky... Lockup if you're not.
Although I didn't like (Understand?) Jon's suggestion at first, I have 
to admit, that his scheme would let this work... because the low level 
driver would know what mode was in place, and you'd call the low-level 
driver to change between 3D & fb mode... 
Although Linus' suggestion works for memory allocation... I don't 
believe it addresses two competing drivers wanting to play with the same 
screen... Even when it's serialised like that. And unfortunately 
although Alan's probably works for DRI & fb on separate heads, how does 
it guarantee that the chipset is all setup the same way for each process 
on different heads... (When they have to share some of the hardware). Or 
is that necessary?
