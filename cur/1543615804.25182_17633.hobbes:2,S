If anyone wants a look NTFS TNG already has gone all the way (for a while 
now in fact). Both fs inode and super block are fs internal slab caches and 
both use static inline NTFS_I / NTFS_SB functions and the ntfs includes 
from linux/fs.h are removed altogether. Code is in sourceforge cvs. For 
instructions how to download the code or to browse it online, see:
         
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13956
The module of interest is ntfs-driver-tng.
If anyone is doing patches for all kernel file systems, don't bother with 
ntfs in 2.5 as NTFS TNG will replace the old ntfs driver soon (certainly in 
2.5 time frame).
Best regards,
         Anton
