Sorry, I had sent an updated email a couple minutes after this one
without the wrapping.

I thought we just went through this?
extern char _text[], _stext[], _etext[];
[...]
prof_len = (_etext - _stext) >> prof_shift;
prof_buffer = alloc_bootmem(prof_len*sizeof(atomic_t));
1MB kernel, 32 bit, prof_shift = 2, makes for 262144 profiling slots,
a granularity of 4 bytes
1MB kernel, 64 bit, prof_shift = 2, makes for 262144 profiling slots,
a granularity of 4 bytes
The only difference between the two being the sizeof(atomic_t), so
that a 32 bit kernel would allocate a 1MB buffer, and a 64 bit kernel
would allocate a 2MB buffer. I'm having nightmares about megawords
again...

now you are confusing me even more... by 8<<2 and 4<<3 do you mean 32
bytes? Linus says the following in 0.98:
# uncomment this if you want kernel profiling: the profile_shift is the
# granularity of the profiling (5 = 32-byte granularity)
