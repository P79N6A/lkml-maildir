Subject: [patch 1/2] semaphores: Add down_interruptible_timeout()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I was in a situation where I could really simplify many things by
using down_interruptible() with a timeout. I went around looking for
how could one be implemented and ran away from the asm code in arch/.
At the end I realized I could make a simple one by setting up a timer
that would 'fake' a sigpending situation (setting the task's TIF_SIGPENDING
bit) so that the __down_interruptible_failed() path would quit when 
the timer went off.
I gave it a quick try (must admit, not too tested) and it seems that
the setting of TIF_SIGPENDING without really having a signal queued
is not having easily visible ugly consequences.
If the timeout arrives right after a signal was delivered but before
the thread returns from down_interruptible, then it will also look
like a timeout (as the code in the if statement will kick in) -- to
some extent, it is 'right' theoretically, as it didn't get the sem
before the time expired. TIF_SIGPENDING is still set, so the signal is
not lost (unless I miss something else about the signal delivery
engine).
IF the timeout arrives after the signal and after down_interruptible
returns, no side effects happen. There is a window where the timer
could still execute before it is deleted and it would look like a
timeout [which theoretically could be right too].  Maybe the result <
0 && data.result < 0 check should be done before
del_timer(). Suggestions accepted.
Arjan van de Ven suggested I moved the declaration into
asm-generic/semaphore.h to lay the egg for a saner sharing of
semaphore code between arches. This patch also introduces that witn
the down_interruptible_timeout() decl and the next adds the inclusion
to all the arches' semaphore.h [note: haven't been able to compile
test all of them, just i386].
