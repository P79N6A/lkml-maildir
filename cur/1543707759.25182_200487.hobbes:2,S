IMO putting that in dentry (let alone inode) is fundamentally broken.
Basically, your flag says "somebody in userland knows the contents
of directory".  So your create-if-clean is inherently racy - if we get
task A                       task B                 task C
had learnt the contents
marked clean
                             changed the contents
                                                        had learnt the contents
                                                        marked clean
did create-if-clean, assuming
its knowledge to be accurate
then A will succeed just fine.
