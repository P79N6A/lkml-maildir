Hm, all distros leave the i2c-dev /dev nodes writable only by root, so
this isn't that "big" of an issue.  I also thought I had caught all of
this previously, when Sergey did the 2.4 patches.

But data->block[0] just came from the hardware, right?  Not from a user.
Now if we have broken hardware, then we might have a problem here, but
otherwise I don't see it as a security issue right now.
