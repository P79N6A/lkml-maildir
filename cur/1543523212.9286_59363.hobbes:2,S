Sorry Larry but this is not a small bit in this context.
Is like speaking about a beautiful girl and say, "OK, ignore the fact that
she/he is a transsexual and has the d*ck" ;)  ( I've nothing against trans )

100 % agree with You here.
More threads running on the same CPU helps nothing !

Probably I've said this even before but the renderer I'm speaking about
is a scanline renderer ( which use shadow maps for shadows and enviroment 
mapping for reflections ).
Now I'm speaking about renderers but there are also other apps that can be
_well_ coded as parallel processing ( I speak about renderes coz is my work ).

Larry this is exactly the case we're speaking about.
All steps of the pipeline are computing intensive and the time spent
for cache misses are << of the times spent computing.
If we want to speak about pipeline steps that do nothing on data but passing 
it to the next step, we can stop this "thread" since I completely agree with
You.
Now I try to explain better these render steps to see want they do _really_ :
Triangulation step takes, say a NURBS object, that resides in memory and feed
the cache of the processor he is running on with that entries.
It does a _computing_intensive_ operation and approximate the surface with 3D
trianagles.
This 3D triangle reside in memory as long as into the cache of this processor
that I'll call A.
Processor B will hold the Viewing Transformation task that is a
_computing_intensive_ process. It _reads_ the 3D triangle that resides in
memory as long into the processor A cache, feeds its own cache entries, and do
3D clipping, 2D projection and 2D viewport clipping. As a result it creates a 2D
polygon ( or triangles is another 2D triangulation step is done) that resides
in memory as long as in processor B cache.
Processor C will hold the Scan Conversion task that is a _computing_intensive_
process.
It reads 2D poligon that reside in memory as long as in processor B cache, 
feeds its own cache entries, and create a set of scanlines that resides in
memory as long as in its own cache.
I stop here since other steps are similar viewed from the point of view that I
want to show.
Any write operation on an object will invalidate only two processor cache.
The one of the writer ( obvious ) and the one of the next pipeline step.
And the Viewing Transformation task _only_ read the 3D triangle == no cache
invalidation is done.
Other processor's cache remain untouched coz a NURBS object will never be 
readed / writed by the Scan Conversion task.
More the write of a 3D triangle from the processor A will never go to
invalidate C processor cache.
More all the pipeline steps are very _computing_intensive_

This is exactly my view of SMP.
One of our businesses is sell architectural design apps that are targeted for
desktops.
Now I can tell to a client : "Do You want a faster render ? Buy a 4 way SMP
machine !".
This can be accepted.
I cannot tell : "Do You want a faster render ? Setup a Beowulf array in Your
show room !".
He shoots me !

I've never put under discussion Your preparation in this field, and more I've
never missed other guys respect on the contrary to others in this list ( Mom
look at me, the time You've spent to educate me is not gone lost ).

Right now I'm working to modify my cluster scheduler to boot only under highly
( with software tunable trigger point ) loaded runqueue leaving the current
implementation in normal cases, like a turbo when the RPM  ( not the RedHat
Package Manager ;) ) of the engine overtake a given entry point.
PS:
I've printed the DOCS You pointed me to but I've got no time to read it due to a
saturday party.
But sure I'll read today.
