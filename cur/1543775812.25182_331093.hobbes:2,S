Subject: LKM function call on kernel function call?

Is it possible to code a loadable module having function1(), which
would be called, everytime a particular function of the kernel is
called? If not, atleast a way this could be done without re-compiling
the whole kernel and rebooting the system?
Example:
My LKM:
-------------
init_module() {
...
}
function1() {
...
}
cleanup_module() {
...
}
I want function1() to be called, everytime the function
ide_do_rw_disk() of ide-disk.c is called. I do not want to re-compile
the complete kernel to do this.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
S
