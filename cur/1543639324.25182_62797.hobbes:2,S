By the way, if you look at Documentation/BUG-HUNTING which describes how
to do binary search to track down bugs, you'll notice you can now do the 
same thing with BK at a much finer granularity.  It's possible to track
down bugs to the changeset which caused the bug, rather than the release.
Which is what Paul is talking about, but he's talking about doing it over
a small set of csets.  You can do it over a large set of csets as well.
File this away as a thing you can do and if you ever need the details,
contact me and I'll walk you through it if it isn't obvious.
