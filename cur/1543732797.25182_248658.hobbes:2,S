i've uploaded -R2:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-R2
no function changes, only fixing some rough edges: it fixes an UP
boot-time assert that occurs right after 'checking hlt'. I also fixed
PREEMPT_TIMING + !LATENCY_TRACE build bugs, and another boot bug that
occurs when PREEMPT_TIMING + !FRAME_POINTERS is used.
(the reboot assert i'm not sure about - tried to reproduce but here
reboot works fine. Will need some sort of serial log to debug this.)
