Dear Developers!
I get this error from several programs:
ie. gnome-session too
[user@host:~]$sawmill
BUG IN DYNAMIC LINKER ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 57: elf_get_dynamic_info:
Assertion `! "bad dynamic tag"' failed!
debian 2.2 linux 2.4.0-test2
glibc 2.1.3
ld.so.1.9.11
( How to regain this:
install staroffice 5.2 for linux in debian 2.2 as root with /net
install it to user
try to run it. 
For me it gets segfault and aborted on my SMP kernel that is optimized for i686
with -march=pentiumpro
After it has got a segfault, try to run gnome-session or sawmill.)
Unfort. SO 5.2 does not run for me on any 2.2.x kernels either.
Does anyone know what is the bugreport address for staroffice?
The interesting thing is that, my friend is running woody on a UP machine, and
he can run SO without problems.
Sorry to disturb you!
