A little story from OLS. I have a 486/75 laptop, which can only
do PIO. It always was losing characters evern on 9600 baud on its
serial port, and I thought it was simply broken for five years.
A guy who did a security talk showed me that doing hdparm -u
fixes the problem. Apparently, the lappy has a non-buffering UART.
So, it seems that hdparm -u is a very useful thing for obsotele
boxes. If you do DMA, you probably do not care.
