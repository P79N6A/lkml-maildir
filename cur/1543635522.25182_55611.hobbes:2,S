   For God's sake, WHY?  Look at what you're doing to your TLB (and if you
   made IPv4 a removable module, I'll bet real money you have a bug unless
   you are *very* *very* clever).
Modules can be mapped using a large PTE mapping.
I've been meaning to do this on sparc64 for a long
time.
So this TLB argument alone is not sufficient :-)
I do concur on the "ipv4 as module is difficult to
get correct" argument however.
