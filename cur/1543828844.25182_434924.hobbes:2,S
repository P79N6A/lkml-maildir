Well I think kmalloc is overkill.  If we are going to keep it we
can keep it in msi_desc.  The structure is only 4 bytes longer than
a pointer as it is.

Sure.
The point of my work was not so much to clean up the code.
But to cleanup up the semantics in how the code worked with
every one else.
The read_msi_msg and write_msi_msg bits were just so I could read
the code enough to clearly tell what was going on.
To a large extent I suspect I have made possible a lot of additional
cleanups all over the place.
