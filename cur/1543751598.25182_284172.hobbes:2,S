I'm pretty sure that part can be done by a privileged server handing
out mlocked shared memory segments.
The trouble with introducing something into the kernel is that once
done, it can't be undone. So you're absolutely going to meet
resistance to anything that can be a) done sufficiently in userspace
or b) can reasonably be done in a more generic manner so as to meet
the needs of a wider future audience. The onus is on the submitter to
meet these requirements because we can't easily kick out a broken API
after we accept it.
