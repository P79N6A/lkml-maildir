No, this is a fundamental problem. You don't refcount
a pointer, you refcount a data structure. But this is
insufficient. We need to make sure the pointer points to valid
memory.
The problem with the current scheme is that serial_table
needs a lock. It needs to be taken in four places
- disconnect()
- open()
- probe()
- read_proc()
Refcounting solves only the race between disconnect() and close()
There's little use in a second locking mechanism if you use it
only in a minority of occasions.
Refcounting is a great idea if the number of references follows
a clear up -> maximum -> down -> free scheme, like for
skbs, etc..

Good suggestion. However, if done right, we'd go for a spin lock.
