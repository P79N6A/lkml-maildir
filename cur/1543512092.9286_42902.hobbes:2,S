hi,
I was having a lots of performance problems with linux 2.2.12 and nfs with clients not linux.
from the knfsd tar file it is not clear:
1) I have to apply the patches (provided on the knfsd 1.5.2) in a linux 2.2.12 ?
2) NFSv3 and knfsd 1.5.2 ... which patches I have to install for make it v3 compatible.
3) Have I to RE-create the nfs kernel-modules after the installation of knfsd 1.5.x ? I didn't yet understand how kernel modules and [nfsd] processes interact ... 
please help.
