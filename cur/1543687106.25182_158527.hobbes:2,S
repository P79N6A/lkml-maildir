Same issue on 2.6.0-test3-mm2 on a Dell Latitude C840 with a TrueMobile 1150
wireless (uses orinoco_cs driver) - card is recognized at boot, and somewhat
configured:
Aug 18 11:16:52 turing-police kernel: eth1: Station identity 001f:0001:0008:000a
Aug 18 11:16:53 turing-police kernel: eth1: Looks like a Lucent/Agere firmware version 8.10

Aug 18 11:16:53 turing-police kernel: eth1: WEP supported, 104-bit key
Aug 18 11:16:53 turing-police kernel: eth1: MAC address 00:02:2D:5C:11:48
Aug 18 11:16:53 turing-police kernel: eth1: Station name "HERMES I"
Aug 18 11:16:53 turing-police kernel: eth1: ready
Aug 18 11:16:53 turing-police kernel: eth1: index 0x01: Vcc 3.3, irq 11, io 0x0100-0x013f
but it takes a 'cardctl eject 2;cardctl insert 2' to actually finish the job
and get things started (actually popping the card out not required, and not
possible, it's a built-in). Relevant .config:
CONFIG_YENTA=y
CONFIG_HERMES=y
# CONFIG_PLX_HERMES is not set
# CONFIG_TMD_HERMES is not set
CONFIG_PCI_HERMES=y
CONFIG_PCMCIA_HERMES=y
I'm wondering if this is a cardmgr/hotplug bug - if they can't insmod the Yenta
support, they don't realize that it could already be onboard so they don't even
try to start the cards?
