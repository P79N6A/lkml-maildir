  I think I've made all scsi modules I need built-in kernel.
  (usbcore, ehci-hcd, usb-storage, sr_mod, sd_mod) Do I miss something?
  Also, I've tested the ASUS CD-RW under kernel 2.5.45 and it worked.
  But in the kernel 2.5.53, the system shows below when I try to mount the
CD-RW.
**   #mount /dev/scd0 /mnt/usb-cd
**   mount: /dev/scd0 is not a valid block device
  There is one thing I forgot to say before.
  I've checked the /proc/scsi/scsi file by running "cat" when I pluged the
device, and it shows below.
** Attached devices: none
 Thanks in advance.
BR,
  Joseph
