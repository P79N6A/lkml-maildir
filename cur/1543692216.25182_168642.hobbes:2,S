And if linux-net doesn't give you a reply, which is where
the networking developers actually read postings, your chances
of getting a reply here are even lower.
Please, keep networking questions on the lists where the net
developers actually are, not here.  We're trying to create a situation
where someone who wants to get involved in networking development
is not required to sift through the hundreds of postings each day
on linux-kernel.
You could try netdev@oss.sgi.com as well.
Thanks.
