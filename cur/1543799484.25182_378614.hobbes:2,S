At what point would adding interfaces to OProfile turn it into perfmon? 
Some of the additions like per-thread monitoring would require signicant 
changes in the kernel that perfmon already implements. The IA64 OProfile 
already uses the perfmon support in the kernel.
Perfmon2 has support for ia64, p6, pentium4, x86_64, ppc, and mips, so 
there is multiple architectures support. OProfile currently supports 
more architectures: alpha,  arm,  i386 (p6/pentium4/athlon),  ia64, 
mips,  ppc,  ppc64,  x86-64, and a fall-back timer mechanisms.
