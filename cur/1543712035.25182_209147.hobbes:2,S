Yes. I use devfs.
Sorry for the delay, I'm back, with a new , more silent, and working 
fan, after a brutal powerdown due to fan failure and CPU overheat... As 
my PC is thre years old, it takes time to find compatible fans...
The machine that boots again but unfortunately I had to hardwire a BIOS 
CMOS reset and therefore BIOS settings have been restored to factory 
default values. I hopefully restored back then to what they where but 
cannot guaranty it 100%.
I applied the patch and get the deadlock is gone *BUT* due to BIOS 
default changed (including one that may impact performance (PIC read 
caching, PCU byte grouping, ...), and the fact that it was probably a 
deadlock due to a window that may have disappearred if I did not restore 
correctly the settings, I cannot gurante that it is the fix that fixed 
the problem.
I hope that Joseph Pingenot that had the same problem can confirm it.
I erased the mail were he was confirming the symptom and I have its 
address no more. Could you double check with him that the patch indeed 
fix the problem?
Thanks for chasing the bug anyway,
