Hello,
> I am hoping to get the "dhcp-2.0b1pl27" dhcp client to work with multiple ip
> adresses on one nic (yes, I have use for this!), like running "dhclient
> eth0:0". But it doesn't work, and the problem seems to be in the following
> (equivalent) code:
just look into /proc/net/dev... where do you have virtual interfaces
listed? :-) eth0:0 is not name of device... It is just needed for ifconfig
and similiar programs to say that 0'd alias of eth0. It is unnecessary for
dhcp to specify aliases - what you have to do is to describe
shared-network. 
With respect,
