He was talking about modules, and modules don't support .init discarding.
modutils do support it, yet the kernel does not. I wrote a patch for this a
few years ago, but after numerous failed attempts to get it into 2.3 I gave
up. With hotplug it is less useful, but eventhough there are many modules
for which it could be a win.
You can search l-k for the patch, or might look it up if you're interested.
Cheers,
