Having recently upgraded my Mandrake 9.0 Laptop to the latest Mandrake cooker 
(9.1beta) it uses the 2.4.21pre3 kernel.  A problem has occured somewhere 
between 2.4.19 and 2.4.21pre3, with regards to the 3c59x driver module.  It 
incorrectly returns the MAC address for my IBM Thinkpad a20m with 3com 
integrated PCI 10/100M ethernet/Modem combo card. (the Nic is a 3com 3c556b, 
which is supported under the 3c59x module)  The 2.4.19 kernel module 
accurately reports the MAC address.
The 2.4.21pre3 MAC address reported for my card is FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF,
which, obviously, is incorrect.  I have never submitted a bug report before, 
so I am not quite sure what all information you need.. there is no error 
message associated with this
