I've got the same problem on two different systems with Logitech Cordless
keyboards. If it's got to do something with hardware it can only be the
keyboard itself.
Interesting thing is, the error does not occur if gpm is running. If I kill
gpm on the console it takes a couple of minutes until the keyboard stops
working. It works again after a couple of minutes or if I unplug and plug in
the keyboard again.
