Could you please turn all the lock debugging options in your .config on 
(most importantly CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING, and all the other lock debugging 
options might come handy too) and try again, to see if we get any debug 
error messages? I'd guess that someone is holding mqueue_inode_info->lock 
for too long or there is some AB-BA deadlock on it, which lockdep and 
friends might be able to diagnose.
