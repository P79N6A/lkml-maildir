    Who, last time I looked, did not think that the C runtime library
    was part of the C programming language.   So you seem to be slightly
    confused.

    Pascal defines its runtime library as part of the language.  And
    this is why (a) Pascal is a dead language, and (b) Modula-2 went
    agressively the other direction.
    Any particular reason why you hoisted up this strawman and chased it
    so vigourously?
