Hi Colin,

It's looking better, but what I'd rather see is code scanning the
CDC descriptors (see "usbnet").  The deal is that there's actually
no guarantee that there's only one data interface, although that
seems to hold true for many current products.
But unless you're interested in finishing a much-needed rewrite
of that cdc-acm probe() code, this might be a good place to stop.
(Or at least pause!)
