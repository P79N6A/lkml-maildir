Something seems strange here to me.  It looks like you are sometimes
resolving the shadowed symbols by making the more local symbol have the
longer name.
I'd have expected that the global symbol would be the one with the
longer, more elaborate name.
In other words, I would have expected that we would avoid having global
names such as (from your other patches in this set):
    filename
    scroll
    instr
    up
    sum
    state
    rep
    complete
    irq
Perhaps I am misreading this patch set?
