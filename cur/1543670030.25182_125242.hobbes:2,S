Because ethernet is not a point-to-point interface. At the hardware
level, ethernet talks from one hardware address to another hardware
address, i.e., the IEEE station address. You need ARP to find out
what that address is so you can't "get there from here." But, you
can do essentially the same thing, you set up a host route on
that interface.
Use a 'private' network address...
On one host:
ifconfig eth1 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.0.255
route add -host my-router-ip-address dev eth1
On the other host:
ifconfig eth1 10.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.0.255
route add -host my-client-ip-address dev eth1
