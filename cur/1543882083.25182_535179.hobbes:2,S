I agree that the driver logic could be addressed too, but to answer your
question...
* Doing things in the right order? (Prepare the image, then do the
atomic copy, then save).
* Mulithreaded I/O (might as well use multiple cores to compress the
image, now that we're hotplugging later).
* Support for > 1 swap device.
* Support for ordinary files.
* Full image option.
* Modular design?
