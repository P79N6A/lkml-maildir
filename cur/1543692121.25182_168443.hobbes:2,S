Sorry guys - probably I'm tired now not yesterday - that time I booted
in old good test4-bk3 (I didn't run lilo before boot).
In recent test5-bk12 with that patch I still get the same problem
irq 9: nobody cared!
Call Trace:
 [<c010b71a>] __report_bad_irq+0x2a/0x90
 [<c010b810>] note_interrupt+0x70/0xb0
..
Disabling IRQ #9
Sorry about this...
I wish I could help more to resolve this problem
Sincerely
Yarik

I've tried again with recent bk12 kernel and this patch worked... 
May be I was too tired and actually didn't patch the first time I
tried, and then reported to you that it didn't help - I'm sorry. Will
check later if it is the case.
Thanx for your help
Sincerely 
Yarik
