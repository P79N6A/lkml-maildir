BTW with ec_initr=1 I cannot toggle the hardware based rf_kill (for ipw2200).
But with ec_initr=0 I can toggle it. This is reflected by the blue "WLAN" led and
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:01:09.0/rf_kill

Mmmh. I see interrupt 9 "IO-APIC-edge  acpi" in /proc/interrupts
increase for ec_intr=0. But it seems to increase all the time so I'm not
sure if it's triggered by battery (un)plug events.
However I cannot see any acpid-events in /var/log/acpid with ec_initr=0 when
(un)plugging the battery. (battery was present and correctly detected on boot.)
For ec_intr=1 interrupt 9 "IO-APIC-edge  acpi in /proc/interrupts is
definitely always constant to 1. No acpid-events, too.
Interestingly the following battery problem is independant of ec_intr:
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/{info,state} shows only sensible battery data, if the
battery was **present at boot time**. When unplugging the battery it still says
"present: yes" and /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/info does not change at all. 
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state does change like this:
--- ec1-plugged-state   2006-02-10 04:40:54.000000000 +0100

If the battery was **not present at boot time** and is plugged in *after* booting
the system, it will never be detected by /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/{info,state}.
It always says "present: no". With Kernel v2.6.15 compiling the acpi drivers as modules, i.e. 
CONFIG_ACPI_BATTERY=m and same fo other acpi drivers helps. But I have to
  $ rmmod battery
  $ modprobe battery
first. No chance with statically compiled acpi-drivers. :(
