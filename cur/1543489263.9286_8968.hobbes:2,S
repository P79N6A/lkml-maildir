Hi! My Linux box is six minutes and a half AHEAD of correct time. I
tried "date -a -displacement", but date says the -a option doesn't
exist! I read the adjtimex API man, but according to it each call is
capable of displacing the clock by about one tenth of a second... is it
true?
Each time I use "date mmddhhmm" to adjust the time, it magically returns
to its previous future clock a few minutes afterwards.
The machine is running a RADIUS server. Could it be the culprit?
