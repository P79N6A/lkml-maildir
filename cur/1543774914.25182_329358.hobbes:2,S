Can't you put the "8Mb page" flag at the PMD level and use normal kernel
page tables ? You'll have to fill PMD entries two by two but that
shouldn't be too difficult.
You can then have the kernel linear mapping use 8Mb pages, along with
some "block IO" translations and leave the rest to normal 4k page tables
