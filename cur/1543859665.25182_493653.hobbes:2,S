Hmm, okay (though the documentation doesn't really provide enough

I'm not entirely convinced that it can be replaced.  What if the page
is in the page cache and is shared with other processes?  That quite
clearly falls under flush_dcache_page()'s remit.

Such a restriction needs to be clearly documented against get_user_pages()
so that users don't expect something from it which it can't deliver.
