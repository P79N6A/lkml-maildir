chown works this way.  At least for username, there's no default user
possible per directory.  But scroll down a bit...

I think it may be possible to set defaults to a certain extent, but I
think that it's still actually a per-file setting whether the file is
encrypted.  Obviously, the keys have to be shared somehow, so there's
probably more grouping than just defaults...
There has been some mention of inheritance, but I've forgotten how
that's supposed to work.  If there's some sort of inheritance where
children inherit properties of their parent directory, and also inherit
changes to those properties, than Hans probably wants that to be the
prefered way of doing things?
I don't think there's that kind of inheritance, though.

If I understand this correctly, this is somewhat like if user A creates
a 50 meg file on a system with 100 megs free RAM, and user B runs
"sync".  Also similar to if B were to suddenly fill up 75 megs of RAM,
forcing A's file to be flushed -- last I checked, in Reiser4, only a
sync or memory pressure causes writes to flush.
Right?  This is tempting to comment on, but I want to make sure I grok
it first...
