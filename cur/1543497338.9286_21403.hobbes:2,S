I tried this (s/ncr_io/ncr_addr), but it didn't work, "Device or resource
busy" again.
Out of curiosity, I set ncr_addr=0x280 which produced this:
--8<--
scsi1: SCSI bus busy, waiting up to 5 seconds
scsi1: bus busy, attempting to abort
--8<--
Then a nearly total freeze (Alt+F? worked but that was all ... oh well,
the sane system was just an fsck away.)
Any ideas?
Nils
