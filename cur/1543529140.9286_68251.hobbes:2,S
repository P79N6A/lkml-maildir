The BSD folks have recently dropped the advertising clause from their
license.  I don't know if this immediately affected the 4.3BSD
compress sources (from which bsd_comp.c was derived, according to the
comment in the source code).
Another issues: the compression algorithm used is probably the one
patented by Unisys (or very similar to it)...
