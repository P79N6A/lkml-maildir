Subject: Wanted: hotfixes for -mm kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Most -mm kernels have small but critical bugs that are found shortly
after release.  Patches for these are posted on linux-kernel but
they aren't made available on kernel.org until the next -mm release.
Would it be possible to create a hotfix/ directory for each -mm
release and put those patches there?  A README could explain that
the fixes are untested.  At least people reading the files could
see an issue exists even if they're not brave enough to try the
patch. :)
