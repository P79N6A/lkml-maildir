Pekka, with a small change to your patch (to handle time-based cache
coherency), your patch worked well and passed all my tests.  Thanks.
So now I wonder if we still need the patch to prevent AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE
from being returned to userland.  I guess we still need it, b/c even with
your patch, generic_writepages() can return AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE back to
the VFS and we need to ensure that doesn't "leak" outside the kernel.
Erez.
