Just a clarification, ZFS not only detects metadata corruption through
the use of checksums but, since it keeps 2-3 copies of each metadata
block on-disk (even on non-replicated pools), it also rewrites the
corrupted blocks, effectively repairing the corruption.
All of this is done transparently to the user but, of course, it's
possible to see a report of checksum failures.
