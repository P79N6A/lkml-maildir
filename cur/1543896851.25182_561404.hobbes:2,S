Please don't do this.  It's very rude.  It's one thing to report a bug 
and say "Please CC me", but it's quite another to ask us to completely 
change the way we're doing everything without actually observing the 
process.  If you're going to make such sweeping requests like this, at 
least have the courtesy to subscribe to the list and read a sampling of 
the traffic for long enough to realize that the current development 
model, for all its flaws, was developed for very good reasons.

What argument?  Userspace ABI is stable, by rule.  Kernel internal API 
and ABI is not.  There is no argument, just people who come along from 
time to time and ask us to do everything the way they like, without 
offering anything in return.

That's what vendor kernels are for.  If you don't want to pay the money, 
just download the source and rebuild it yourself.

Closed or open, someone somewhere is probably willing to take your money 
in exchange for making it work.  If you're not willing to spend money, 
or offer something else in exchange, then nobody has any reason to go 
out of their way make life easy for you.  The community works to help 
itself, not the freeloaders.  Many of us (such as myself) actually get 
paid to maintain stable releases to ensure a good user experience, so 
we're well aware of the issues you face.

Actually, the current architecture is flexible enough that adding these 
things in isn't all that hard.  We already have kvm merged, and the 
scheduler work is proceeding nicely.  Please don't start another Reiser4 
flamewar.

These are build trivialities.  This is hardly reason to change the 
development model.

If I submit a patch to a RHEL kernel that breaks kABI, people knife me 
in the hallways, because I get paid to maintain it.

No, you're asking *us* to do stupid things.  If you want a more stable 
kABI in the upstream kernel, then start submitting patches that 
implement the hooks you need to do it.

It's already been done in a few different places.  2.4.x is still 
maintained.  2.6.16.y is still maintained.  Several vendors maintain 
stable kernels, some even kABI-stable, for many years after release. 
Since the vast majority of users are running distro kernels rather than 
upstream kernels, I think it's fair to say that anything post-2.6.16 
from kernel.org is a de facto development kernel, at least to users with 
extreme stability requirements like yourself.  Find yourself a distro 
that's the right balance of modern and stable, and use that kernel.  If 
there isn't a distro that's both modern enough and stable enough, then 
there are probably some very good economic reasons why this is the case.
