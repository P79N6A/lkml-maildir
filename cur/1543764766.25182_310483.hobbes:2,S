Subject: [PATCH] re-export cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This was unexported by Arjan because we have no current users.
However, during a conversion from tasklets to workqueues of the parisc
led functions, we ran across a case where this was needed.  In
particular, the open coded equivalent of
cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue was implemented incorrectly, which is,
I think, all the evidence necessary that this is a useful API.
