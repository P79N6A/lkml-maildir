I've experienced a serious problem with this version of quilt that is 
rather hard to explain but definitely arrived with this version as 
reverting to 0.42 makes the problem go away.
Now to try to explain the problem :-(
The problem arises when pushing a patch that has errors in it (due to 
changes in the previous patches in the series) and needs the -f flag to 
force the push.  What's happening is that the reverse of the errors is 
being applied to the "pre patch" file in the .pc directory.  Then when 
you pop this patch it returns the file to a state with the reverse of 
the errors applied to it.
I'm having trouble understanding how quilt could be dumb enough to do 
this as surely the "pre patch" file in the .pc directory should be just 
a copy of the file before the patch is applied.
This bug can completely hose a set of patches if the user doesn't notice 
it very early and do something about it.  The work around is to revert 
to version 0.42 of quilt.
