I must have messed something up when testing before - reverting to 
forcedeth.c from 2.6.20-rc6 does indeed fix the problem. And it doesn't 
seem like no packets at all are received with the -mm3 version (driver 
version 0.60), either - if I do a tcpdump I can get Ethernet packets 
showing up, but I can't ping my router so it seems like something isn't 
getting through properly. With the 2.6.20-rc6 version (driver version 
0.59) it works fine. I switched back and forth between versions and this 
seems repeatable.
I don't think it's MSI related, the CK804 version of these controllers 
doesn't support MSI and the driver shouldn't be trying to use it. I 
tried the MSI and MSI-X disable options on the 0.60 driver, but that 
didn't help.
