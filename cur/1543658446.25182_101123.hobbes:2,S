Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, all, 
	Here again is my delay-cleanup patch. As described earlier, this patch
tries to cleanup the delay code by moving the timer-specific
implementations into the timer_ops struct. Thus, rather then doing:
	if(x86_delay_tsc)
		__rdtsc_delay(loops);
	else if(x86_delay_cyclone)
		__cyclone_delay(loops);
	else if(whatever....
we just simply do:
	timer->delay(loops);
Please apply on top of linux-2.5.54_timer-none_A0.
thanks
-john
