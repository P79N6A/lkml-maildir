My suspicion is that the X driver (MGA, right?) copies its BIOS into
its address space, sets up io permissions for it to fiddle with your
card, and then calls sys_vm86 with the appropriate registers to call
into the interrupt handler when sys_vm86 swaps those registers in and
does "jmp resume_userspace". When the video BIOS software interrupt
handler does iret, we get the fault, copy the registers to our 32-bit
usermode (tripping might_sleep), and then swap the 32-bit registers
back in for another jump to resume_userspace.
The fix is making return_to_32_bit return back to the end of
do_sys_vm86 rather than straight to userspace, at which point we can
safely handle the registers.
