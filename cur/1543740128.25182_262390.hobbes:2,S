What I was asking is what rules you are referring to.  Do you mean
obvious ones like "no sleeping in ISRs", or guidelines like "ISRs must
execute quickly" where "quickly" is defined by some consensus?
Anyway my point is that if you mean the latter then the rules are not
quite draconian.  Fortunately this seems to be the only exception, and
the problem and the fix seem to be well understood.
I should add that unless LBA48 is in use the max request size is 128KB
which effectively hides the issue.
