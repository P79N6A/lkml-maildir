Why do you have to fix up all page structs' PageDirect and as.vma
fields when a vma_split or vma_merge occurs.
Can't you do it lazily on the next page_referenced or page_add_rmap,
etc. Anyway we can get to the anon_vma using as.vma->anon_vma.
I understand that currenly your code assumes that if PageDirect is
set, then there cannot be an anon_vma corresponding to the page.
