Subject: Bug: 2.6.15 Process accounting fails to account for small time slice loads (still)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The bug described back in 2004 in the following message still seems to exist:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2004-05/4313.html
Essentially, it appears that if a process sleeps before it uses up a
complete jiffy then no charge is made to its process accounting table.
This problem still exists in the same manner in kernel:
 2.6.15-1.2054_FC5smp #1 SMP Tue Mar 14 16:05:46 EST 2006 i686 i686
i386 GNU/Linux
The linked message above contains the necessary code to easily test
for the problem.  It compiles cleanly, just be sure to include -lrt on
the command line.
Cheers,
Tom Burns
