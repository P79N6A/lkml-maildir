I have updated PPSkit-0.9.3 with no functional change, only to change
the patch that was not including new files to be created.
The MD5 checksum of the new patch is
7a987cc121089addd1ce9cb70219e470 *patch-2.2.16
If your patch is older that 2000-07-20 18:00:00 UTC you have the old one.
Sorry for the inconvenience, but it seems only one user has tried it
so far (or the other users found a way to fix it).
Regards,
Ulrich

Title:          PPSkit
Version:        0.9.3
Entered-date:   2000-07-20
Description:    General kernel patch to implement nanoseconds as time
                resolution.  Upgrades the kernel clock model for NTP v4
                (nanokernel '#3'), including PPS support.  Adds support for
                capturing external timestamps with high precision via RFC 2783
                (PPS API v1).
Keywords:       NTP, PPS, PPS API, kernel patch, RFC1305, RFC1589, RFC2783,
                clock_gettime, clock_getres, clock_settime, pulse-per-second,
                time synchronization, time calibration, adjtimex, nanoseconds,
                POSIX.4, nanokernel, hardpps
