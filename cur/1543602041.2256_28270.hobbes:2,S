I am very encouraged by the latest linus kernel, and
thought I'd pass this along -
Platform info -
----------------
PIII 933/Intel mobo
512 MB RAM
2 30 GB IDE disks
Ensoniq ES1371 sound card
Red Hat 7.1 + bits of rawhide
kernel 2.4.10-pre14 + preempt patch
The testing was done while running X windows (icewm), Netscape 4.78,
iptraf, and misc other services (named, sendmail, apache, iptables
firewalling etc.
During the dbench runs mpg123 was playing mp3s -
Highlights -
------------
 - There was absolutely no mp3 skipping during dbench 16 & 32.
 - There was minor skipping during dbench 40, when load was near 40.
 - Best of all, the desktop remained completely responsive the entire
time.
