Odd. As there shouldn't be a difference, I'm inclined to believe that this is card dependent. So it could as well appear with some SD cards as well.
How much have you tested this issue? That tracker entry isn't very verbose.
Also, how can an underrun appear? The system should have flow control. And an underrun does not sound like a bus problem, rather that you have a card with different speed characteristics than the hardware/driver can handle.

_If_ it truly cannot handle 4-bit MMC, then Mike's patch is the way to go. But I'm not yet convinced that the problem is related to MMC vs SD.
