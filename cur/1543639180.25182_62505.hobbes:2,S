Okay, I'm starting to have enough guts about this to release for
testing...
klibc is a tiny C library subset intended to be integrated into the
kernel source tree and being used for initramfs stuff.  Thus,
initramfs+rootfs can be used to move things that are currently in
kernel space, such as ip autoconfiguration or nfsroot (in fact,
mounting root in general) into user space.
I would particularly appreciate portability comments, since I'm flying
blind on non-i386 machines (anyone want to send me hardware?),
although any bug reports would be appreciated.

I haven't bothered putting a version number on it, since it changes
quite often.  I have also published the CVS repository in the
directory above.

P.S. I'm aware gregkh already started a klibc project; I have
discussed it with him and we have agreed my project supercedes his.
