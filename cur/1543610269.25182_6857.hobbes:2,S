David,
I need some help here (big surprise).  I did nothing other than 
download pre7, apply my patch, and do the build.  I went back 
over how I did the build, and this is the result of the build 
if you have unpacked, patched, then run "make oldconfig."  If I
do a "make dep" then this problem does not occur, and the build 
works fine.  If I build the external module (this bug only 
shows up when building the external module file system driver,
not the kernel patched version of NWFS).
No. I think the build in linux is broken.  The Linux tree should 
not generate garbase opcodes from the includes is make dep 
has not been run and someone is simply building a module against
the include files.
:-)
