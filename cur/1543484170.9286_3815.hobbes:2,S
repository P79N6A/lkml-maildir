Hi there,
sidekick:~# for one in  /proc/sys/fs/*; do echo $one : `cat $one`; done
/proc/sys/fs/dentry-state : 0 96658 45 0 0 0
/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max : 0
/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr : 0 0
/proc/sys/fs/file-max : 7168
/proc/sys/fs/file-nr : 4860 3113 7168
/proc/sys/fs/inode-max : 20480
/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr : 1268624 3
/proc/sys/fs/inode-state : 1268624 9 1 0 0 0 0
/proc/sys/fs/super-max : 256
/proc/sys/fs/super-nr : 6
Does the above fall into the same category? I'm talking about the inode-nr
and inode-state numbers - they are ridiculously big to me. The numbers for
inode-max and file-max are slightly bumped up. Kernel is 2.2.1. More details
uppon request :).

Thanks!
