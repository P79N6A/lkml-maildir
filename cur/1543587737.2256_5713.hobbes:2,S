Hi,
2.4.3-ac4 seems to work great on my test box (UP K6-2 with SCSI
disk), but 2.4.3-ac6 and 2.4.3-ac7 hang pretty hard when I try
to access any of the logical volumes on my test box.
The following changelog entry in Linus' changelog suggests me
whom to bother:   ;)
 - Jens Axboe: LVM and loop fixes
regards,
Rik
