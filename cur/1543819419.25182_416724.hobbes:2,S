I didn't see quite the stability from run to run that your results
suggest.  Running the benchmark five times on the same kernel, I saw
the mean value of the 128 results go from as low as 439 to as high
as 445.  So the difference between commenting in/out the notify_die
call is in the noise.
But comparing the first and last of your results shows that there
is significant slowdown when the notify chain is loaded up with a
ton of stuff, way more than the noise that I see, and I'm glad to see
Anil jumping in to fix this.
