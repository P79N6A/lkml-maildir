Indeed. That's *especially* true since right now it passes a mostly 
totally uninitialized structure pointer down to direct_io_worker(), but it 
has actually initialized a _few_ fields. Ie the "die" pointer is almost 
totally filled with random crap, except for two members: dio->lock_type 
and dio->is_async have been initialized the rest is random crud.
That kind of mixing of totally-but-not-entirely-uninitialized pointer 
passing is just a recipe for disaster.
Does a patch like this work? I don't have any test-cases, but it would be 
good to have something like this tested and passed back with proper 
explanations and sign-offs.
