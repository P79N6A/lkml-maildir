We made an explicit decision not to do things this way.
Non-blocking has a meaning dependant upon the xfrm_larval_drop sysctl
setting, and this is across the board.  If xfrm_larval_drop is zero,
non-blocking semantics do not extend to IPSEC route resolution,
otherwise it does.
If he sets this sysctl to "1" as I detailed in my reply, he'll
get the behavior he wants.
