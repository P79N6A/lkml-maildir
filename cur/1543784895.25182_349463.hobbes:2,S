-mm2 and -mm3 seem good, at least compile and boot up :)
However for both, I'm seeing this when making modules_install:
if [ -r System.map -a -x /sbin/depmod ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map 
2.6.13-mm3; fi
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.13-mm3/kernel/net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6t_NFQUEUE.ko

WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.13-mm3/kernel/net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6t_NFQUEUE.ko

[root@tornado linux-2.6]#
Seems to be caused by this option in .config set to 'm':
<M>   Netfilter NFQUEUE over NFNETLINK interface
Symbol: NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE [=m]
Prompt: Netfilter NFQUEUE over NFNETLINK interface
Defined at net/netfilter/Kconfig:7
Full .config up at 
http://www.reub.net/kernel/2.6.13-mm3-config.
I suspect there is a dependency here on ip6_tables, which I am not currently 
compiling in or building as a module?
