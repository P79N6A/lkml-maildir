I do not think finding out "which pid is controlling nbd#2" is _that_
important.
We have /var/lock files for ttyS*, I do not see reason why nbd should
be different. Actually you could copy /var/lock approach.
And BTW that /sys/ thingie is racy by design (as is the log file). By
the time you try to do anything with that PID, process may be gone.
