add_timer_on() was added specifically for slab bringup.  If we need extra
locking to cope with it then the best solution would probably be to rename
it to add_timer_on_dont_use_this_for_anything_else().
But if we are going to rely on timer handlers only ever running on the
adding CPU for locking purposes then can we please have a big comment
somewhere describing what's going on?  It's very subtle...
