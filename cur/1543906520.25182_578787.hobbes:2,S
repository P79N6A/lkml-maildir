Oh good. Thanks for getting to the bottom of it. We have normally
disliked too much runtime tunables in the scheduler, so I assume
these are mostly going away or under a CONFIG option for 2.6.23?
Or...?
What CPU did you get these numbers on? Do the indirect calls hurt
much on those without an indirect predictor? (I'll try running some
tests).
I must say that I don't really like the indirect calls a great deal,
and they could be eliminated just with a couple of branches and
direct calls.
