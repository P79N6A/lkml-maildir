Just a long shot, but ....
I get this message when I plug my Microsoft Internet keyboard (which has both PS/2
and USB interfaces) into my VIA-based MB, with both cables connected; if the
legacy PS/2 cable is in use, it causes the USB interface internal to the keyboard
to claim itself dead.  A feature, not a bug.
