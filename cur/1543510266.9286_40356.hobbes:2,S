   The buffer hash you are using looks very slow in computing the hash even
   if it may be the fairest in the math world.
It's 10 instructions, cut me a break, cache/tlb misses on load
instructions due to a mediocre hash cost several orders of magnitude
more than these 5 measly cpu cycles.
"very slow" indeed...
