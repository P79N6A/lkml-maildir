The bug isn't that the config option exists, but that it's a generic
option for all drives, as that will definately cause problems on
systems where some drives need it set one way and some the other.
The fix for this bug would be to make it a per-drive setting, with the
DEFAULT value set by the kernel config option, and a separate sysctrl
or /proc facility for changing the value for specific drives.
Best wishes from Riley.
