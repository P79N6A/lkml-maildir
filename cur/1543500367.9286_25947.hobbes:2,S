I have been toying with this for the past month or so.  If you get Vojtech
Pavlik's input patches (
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/input
) you
can have multiple keyboards and mice (PS/2, USB, serial, whatever) all
present and have the keyboards directed to different consoles.  Right now I
have two Matrox cards in a machine with two text consoles up, each
completely independent.
I have tried X, but only with the 'mga' driver.  (I'm in the development
group, so I'm using 3.9.)  This does not work.  I haven't tried the fbdev
driver, though I doubt that if it works it will be fast enough to be
useful.  The XFree folks are interested in making this work with their
drivers, but not until after 4.0 is available (which I agree is a very
reasonable).
One odd thing I'm seeing now is that on the text consoles there's only one
cursor; other displays just don't get one although they still work fine.
Does anyone have any ideas how I might continue to play with this?  I've
just done the minimal work of compiling in the matroxfb stuff compiled with
multi-head on.  I haven't tried tuning the parameters except for
append="video=map:01"
