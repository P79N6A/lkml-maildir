Simply give a larger share of timeslices to the TCP receiver won't solve the
problem.  No matter what the timeslice is, if the TCP receiving process has
packets within backlog, and the process is expired and moved to the expired
array, RTO might happen in the TCP sender.
The solution does not look like that simple.
