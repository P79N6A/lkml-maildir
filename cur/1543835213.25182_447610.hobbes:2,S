Symlinks.

udevmonitor prints the received event from the kernel [UEVENT]
and the event which udev sends out after rule processing [UDEV]
UEVENT[1154093169.330045] add@/devices/mem
UDEV  [1154093169.331914] add@/devices/mem
The device node was not created.
udev.log for 2.6.18-rc1-mm2 (which does work) has these lines:
UEVENT[1154105360.092631] add@/class/mem/mem
ACTION=add
DEVPATH=/class/mem/mem
SUBSYSTEM=mem
SEQNUM=589
MAJOR=1
MINOR=1
...
UDEV  [1154105363.575086] add@/class/mem/mem
UDEV_LOG=3
ACTION=add
DEVPATH=/class/mem/mem
SUBSYSTEM=mem
SEQNUM=589
MAJOR=1
MINOR=1
UDEVD_EVENT=1
DEVNAME=/dev/mem
The Changelog for udev v081 has:
"prepare moving of /sys/class devices to /sys/devices"
Is this related? 
Thanks,
