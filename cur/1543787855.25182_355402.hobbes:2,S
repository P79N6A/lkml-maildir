Arjan, could you mention some Linuxes which don't allow it?
Every time the topic of DMA to/from stack comes up, the advice is
always to avoid it ... but so far as I recall, nobody's yet provided
us with an example where it actually doesn't work.
Failing such examples, it's normal to discount such dire warnings and
just plan to apply the relevant minor tweaks if/when they're needed.
