# [PNP] /drivers/pnp/resource.c check_region warning fix
# 
# This patch resolves the compiler warning caused by the depreciated check_region
# function.  It may not be the best solution but check_region really is what is
# needed here because we never actually have to call "request_region".  If prefered,
# I could alternatively request and release but doing so would be less efficient.
