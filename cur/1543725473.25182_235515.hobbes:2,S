Especially not ones as cookie-cutter/buzzword-filled/annoying as that 
one was.  Seriously, if you want non-morons to want to work for you, 
you've got to write a more interesting job description, and please stop 
using words like "entrepreneurial" and "elite" when you know the job's 
going to suck.
This just reinforces what I always say about HR staff being out of touch 
with the people they hire.
