No no again :-)
You don't have to do anything special.  You don't have to keep the file
open or notify the kernel.
There's simply no need to update the serial number more than once
between checks.  This is a way of avoiding wraparound due to lots of
writes between checks.
(Tweak: Further optimise by not incrementing the number if mtime is
changed (unless by utime(); (can you tell I used to program Lisp(!)?)))
