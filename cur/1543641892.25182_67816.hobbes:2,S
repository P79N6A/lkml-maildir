The process was at nice level 0, which I think corresponds to prio 15-25
for interactive to background tasks if I understand things correctly.  
When I used top to renice the process to -10, the prio became 15, i.e. it
was still considered non-interactive.  I even tried -20 (or maybe -19),
and it was still at the non-interactive prio.
In other words:  For all nice values I tried (-20, -10, 0), the prio was
20+nice+5.  When the server is lightly loaded, the prio is 20+nice-5.
Note that even when the server was loaded, it only used 70% CPU, which I
suppose must mean that it does not use up the time slices, which I thought
should make the kernel treat the process as interactive.  Is there a
description of the criteria somewhere (other than in the source code)?
