Yes, acpi=noirq will work around this bug in many cases, because Linux
will not try to reassign IRQs set up by BIOS.
BTW, the problem may be considered as an ACPI BIOS bug, because
reconfiguring a PCI Interrupt Link should set up IRQ routing, but it
obviously does not.  Unfortunately, this problem seems to be widespread,
so a workaround in kernel is needed.
