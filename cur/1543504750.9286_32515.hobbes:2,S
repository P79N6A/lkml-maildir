Amen to that!

I can see five levels of priorities, as follows:
 1. CPU initialisation. Until we've sorted out the CPU, the rest
    is irrelevant.
 2. Memory initialisation. We need to know what's available, and
    how it should be used.
 3. Bus initialisation. We can't guarantee to be able to access
    the hardware until this has been done.
 4. Hardware initialisation. Make sure that the hardware io and
    IRQ is sensible. This deals with the various forms of PnP.
 5. Driver initialisation. Do anything else that doesn't fall in
    the above categories, such as setting sound card mixer levels.
Anything above that is meaningless, IMHO.

Personally, I would see the above not as dependancies, but as a
general categorisation of the drivers into different stages of the
start-up process, so we can ensure that we deal with everything at a
specific level before starting with stuff that depends on that level
being set up.
Best wishes from Riley.
