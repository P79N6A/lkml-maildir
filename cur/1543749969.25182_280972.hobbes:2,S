Of course, you're right - sorry, my brains switched off.  I'll
take a look in the new year if you don't figure it out before
I get back. :)  The only other thought I had was perhaps the
writer field assignment is getting reordered around the atual
lock, may need some judicious use of memory barriers in there;
that needs some details analysis though.
cheers.
