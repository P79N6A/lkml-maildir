I've sent a patch to James several weeks ago that removes the complete
table with NV_ARCH_ mappings and uses PCI-IDs instead. He applied it to
the fbdev tree, but it didn't end up in Linus tree yet.
This patch just fixes what's obviously wrong. More cleanup to come once
rivafb is in a usable shape for me again.
