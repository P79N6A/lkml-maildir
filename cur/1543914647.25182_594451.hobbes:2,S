[PATCH] x86_64: set cfg_size for AMD Family 10h in case MMCONFIG is used
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/12/352
the first two is doing as the way as hpa think that we should do.
the third one: ak doesn't like it, but greg said it is needed for

and andrew already put them into -mm.
one side fact is, I could use mmconfig when acpi=off too.
