For those interested in Envlinkfs (ex-Symlinkfs), I've put the sources on
my homepage: 
http://perso.cybercable.fr/pop
 (both kernel 2.0 and
kernel 2.2 versions)
For those who don't know what Envlinkfs is, it's a kind of "virtual
filesystem" containing links which can be configured using environment
variables of the calling process (that's it, different processes can see 
different files!)
For all the others, just ignore this message :)
