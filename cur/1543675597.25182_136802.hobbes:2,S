Subject: 2.5.70 freezes when running hwclock

I have tried 2.5.70 on an intel chipset based pc, and I got a
reproductible complete freeze during the boot process when hwclock is
run. Even Caps Lock wouldn't lit the little led.
Removing the offending line, 2.5.70 seemed to work... I haven't fully
tried it yet.
Is this problem known/identified/fixed yet, or do you want a more
complete bug report ?
