hm, i understood that peak remark to be in reference to FreeBSD's 
scheduler (which the FreeBSD guys are primarily interested in 
obviously), not v2.6.21 - but i could be wrong.
In any case, there is indeed a regression with sysbench and a low number 
of threads, and it's being fixed. The peak got improved visibly in 
sched-devel:

but there is still some peak regression left, i'm testing a patch for 
that.
