the siginfo is queued when a process is killed and si_pid is updated using
the pidspace of the killing process. Processes parent of a pidspace are of
a special kind : the init kind.

Well, a process doing waitpid on a parent of a pidspace, is not part
of that pidspace so waitpid would return the 'real pid'.
Am i getting your point correctly ?
>>>What pid does waitpid return when both processes are in the same pidspace?
hmm, please elaborate.
There are indeed issues when a process is the parent of different
namespaces. This case that should be avoided.

"virtualize" the mount points but not necessarily the whole filesystem.

We feel the same.
