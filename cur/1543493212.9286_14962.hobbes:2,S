Look at the calculation:     new_pP = fP | (fI & old_pI)
You can emulate an old-style UNIX two ways.
Option X:  fI is assumed empty and pI is assumed full
Option Y:  pI is assumed empty and fI is assumed full
Linux currently does option X. This is stupid though, because it
makes no distinction between fI and fP. When option X is used,
the equation reduces to this:     new_pP = fP | fI

Yes, and you can have a highly-secure option too.

Consider what happens with option Y, where we assume that an unmarked
executable has a full fI. The ability to add bits to pI is dangerous.
The bits in pI are what give an admin power.
You also destroy option Z, the highly secure system.
