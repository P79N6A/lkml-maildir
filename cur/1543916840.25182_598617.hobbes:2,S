You haven't fully answered Jon's question.  Suppose
module_unload_inhibit_cnt is nonzero, so the task adds itself to the
module_unload_wait queue, changes to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, and calls
schedule.  There's nothing to prevent somebody else from waking the
task back up before the original inhibition has been lifted.
