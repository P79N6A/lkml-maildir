Can you remove 'printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: %ux%u, vt=%u, init=%u, ...'
from fbcon_set_display (drivers/video/console/fbcon.c)? On my system
printk(KERN_DEBUG) does not print nothing to the console even before
syslogd is started (one wonders why...), but on your system it apparently
triggers output to console before video mode was set.
                                            Thanks,
