Great!

I don't see problems with the init_bootmem_node() usage. The 
free_area_init_core() usage is questionable. No, you should not
use free_area_init_node() as it stands currently. For several 
reasons, I am thinking of defining free_area_init_node() for non 
CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM cases, you might think about it then. Note
that free_area_init_node() also invokes free_area_init_core(),
it will probably be put into a header file soon. I would suggest
stick with the call to free_area_init_core() till then, but
we do need to clean this up before 2.4.
