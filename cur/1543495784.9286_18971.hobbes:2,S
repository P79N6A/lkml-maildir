No, I remember this discussion from when sendfile() was originally
introduced, and this is taken care of.  I don't remember the exact
mechanism discussed at the time, but from reading the manpages for
sendfile(2) and tcp(4), it appears you can use the socket option TCP_CORK; 
from tcp(4): 
       TCP_CORK
              If enabled don't  send  out  partial  frames.   All
              queued  partial  frames are sent when the option is
              cleared again.  This is useful for prepending head-
              ers  before  calling sendfile(2), or for throughput
              optimization. This option cannot be  combined  with
              TCP_NODELAY.
It seems like I remember discussion of a mechanism for signalling the tcp
stack when it's ok to go ahead and send out, but I'm not sure of this.
DaveM would know...
