Hi Pavel,
I'm not sure I'm understanding your question, but if you mean the different
levels of power savings you would get, no.  With ALPM you have the option of
instructing the link to either go into slumber or partial mode when it 
determines the link is quiet.  Slumber uses less power, but has more latency
to come out of.  So, for a SATA device, setting the link_power_managment
file to "medium_power" will set up the link to only go into Partial mode,
which has less power savings (about half by my informal measurement), but 
less latency, and therefore less of a performance hit.
Hopefully this answers your question.
Kristen
