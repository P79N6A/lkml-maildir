Sorry, I know how open(O_TRUNC) sets it as it calls do_truncate(,, 
ATTR_MTIME|ATTR_CTIME,) but at present both {f,}truncate() call 
do_truncate(,, 0,) and I do not see anywhere else where the setting 
would/could be done, other than in the file system ->truncate method.
In fact if I take the setting of {m,c}time out of ntfs_truncate(), doing:
touch
stat foo
truncate foo 10
stat foo
Does not result in a change in the {m,c}time...
Given posix/sus3 requires setting of {m,c}time on truncate, it would 
appear that a file system ->truncate function needs to set {m,c}time 
itself...
Please explain why you added your comment to ntfs...
Thanks a lot in advance.
Best regards,
	Anton
