the -J7 O(1) scheduler patch for kernels 2.5.3-pre5, 2.4.17-pre7 and
2.4.17 is available at:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O

http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.4.18-pre7-J7.patch
-J7 includes the fixes and improvements explained in the component patches
sent to lkml earlier today. -J7 is the combination of those 9 patches,
backported to 2.4.17 and 2.4.18-pre as well.
i'd like to ask those people to retest -J7 who had problems booting the
O(1) scheduler on fb-console enabled systems. Also, the shell 'hanging'
problems should be fixed in -J7 as well.
please also report any interactiveness degradation/improvement relative to
any of the previous 'J series' patches: -J2, -J4, -J5 and -J6.
More adventurous people might want to tweak the new tunables in sched.h,
and/or try Jack F. Vogel's runtime tuning patch. Careful though, eg.
setting MAX_TIMESLICE too low can produce unexpected results ...
Bug reports, comments, suggestions welcome,
	Ingo
