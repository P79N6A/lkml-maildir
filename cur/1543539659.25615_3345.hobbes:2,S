Right.

There are different drives and different drive manufacturers, all of them
using different upgrade methods. Most of the info is not publicly
available. While I can imagine driver manufacturers make disk utils
(which use raw ioctl interface) available, I don't think it's possible
they soon start to write any necessary kernel modules.

Should we block firmware updating or not? The patch blocked it.
Without blocking it, you gain exactly nothing.

Does firmware updating count as this crap, and thus it should be
impossible? If you have interface for updating the firmware, you
have a way to destroy the HDD - just use incorrect firmware.

Right.

Does flash update command fall into legit category or not?

As well as he's taking flash updates away.
Well, let's compare:
current (+CAP_RAW bug fixed) interface:
+ smaller kernel size
+ all IDE commands (incl. proprietary ones) are handled allowing
  for simple diagnostics tools from hw makers
+ disabling raw caps you disable access at hardware level.
- otherwise rogue root can erase drive firmware
No raw ioctl + all-in-kernel interface:
- larger kernel size
- every diagnostics tool need special kernel module from hw maker
- rogue root can still damage the drive using flash update
  (or any other suitable) interface.
The original patch:
- larger kernel size
- no possibility to use any diagnostics tools
- rogue root can still damage the drive using any suitable interface
  probably unless raw caps are revoked.
Of course I agree there should be better way to, for example, put
a drive into sleep, and it probably shouldn't require raw caps
(could a drive be destroyed be using this?). This is a minor thing
anyway (and a patch which adds such interface would be 10 lines long).
