Compared to a current linus kernel, it fixes the overflow problem.
Compared to the current mm (good job on finding the sneaky bug in that
one by the way) it doesn't fix anything additional, but still fixes
all of the same things plus the academic problems. And it makes the
GNU coreutils people happy, which is rarely a bad thing.
