I'd imagine most things would just work. It's only going to be 
the things that make assumptions about memory layout that will 
break.
I picked X as an example because it cares quite a bit about 
memory layout, especially when mapping in framebuffers and 
whatnot.

The address stack on 68K grows downwards because JSR, BSR, etc. 
do the stack manipulation for you.
Sure, you _could_ use JMP and BRA and maintain your own linkage, 
but that'd take a large performance hit. Much larger than making 
the data stack grow upwards, I dare say.

Right. I don't think it cares. Nice architecture ;-)
