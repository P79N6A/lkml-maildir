Probably only if accepted into the mainstream code. 
I really doubt you want to run a softmodem in kernel space anyway. Its
MMX and float heavy, its large (they tend to be 200K+ code) and potentially
at that size and for what it has to do very buggy (yes you _can_ have 
buffer overruns in soft modems 8)).
Its probably a real time process job
