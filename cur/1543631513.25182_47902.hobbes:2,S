Sorry, I'm not clear on this one. I was first proposing (for the short
term, at least) to not change anything at all: all the existing
implementations of pci_dma_sync_*(..., PCIDMA_TO_DEVICE) already do what
is required: prepare the buffer to be DMAed from by the controller. Most
drivers won't have to deal with this; most network drivers, for example,
do a pci_map_*() on an skb passed down from the stack and subsequently
pci_unmap_*() those buffers once transmitted, thus having no need for
pci_dma_sync_*()... So I don't see how this makes anything else less
efficient...

Such a call would do what pci_dma_sync_*(..., PCIDMA_TO_DEVICE) already
does (unless that is what you want - to have a new call just for the
sake of clarity...).
Thanks,
William
