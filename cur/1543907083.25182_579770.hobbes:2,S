FWIW, I haven't experienced my "stuck delete" key anymore -- "since using 
CFS v19.1", but that might very well just be coincedence. If anyone 
wants/needs me to, I'll try to debug it, but for now I seem to be fine again.
Now all I need to know is whether or not moving thunderbird's windows around 
is expected to leave such an enormous non-repainting visual trail on the 
screen...
I believe I'm concluding that I'm not all together fond of the "new" modular 
X.org.
Rene.
