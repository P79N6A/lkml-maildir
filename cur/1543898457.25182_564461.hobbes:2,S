How is this different from Red Hat wearing the permanent cost of
carrying Execshield or other vetoed-by-upstream features ?
Given the choice, I'd ship a kernel for Fedora with nothing added
that isn't upstream, but we have something of a legacy from our
dumber days. (Though we've managed to drop lots of the more invasive
stuff over time thankfully.. 4g4g for eg).

Indeed.  The idea of granting exceptions to our usual acceptance
criteria just because "some distro shipped it" strikes me as wrong
on so many levels, regardless of its technical flaws.
And this isn't just because this is a patch from a competitor,
I'd expect the exact same criteria to be applied if I tried
to ram execshield etc down everyones throats.
