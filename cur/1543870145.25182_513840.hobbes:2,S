Depending on how big and box-specific the code is we could either add
it to i8042
or you need to imaplement a pass-through serio port in your driver.
You would filter out "interesting" bytes and pass the rest to the new
serio port that your driver shoudl register. Tnen atkbd would bind to
that new port and function as usual. The only problem is that you
woudl need to bind you driver to the keyboard port from userspace (via
sysfs - /sys/bus/devices/serioX/drvctl)
