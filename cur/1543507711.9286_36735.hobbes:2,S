     I want to second this request..
     On a Sun SS-10, quad Ross RTK-625 CPU's, the compile time for compiling
the linux kernel with make -j4 is almost twice as long without the patch as
with it.
     I do have some serious stability problems and have had since 2.2.x came
out, (though they have gotten better, with 2.2.1 it would go into the spin_lock
thing usually before it finished getting into multi-user mode, or after it
crashed, before it would finish the fsck), but I have those problems with or
without the patch and actually it seems to be slightly more stable with the
patch.
