There's a speed-space tradeoff here as well.  Making the dentry smaller
means that more can be cached, which reduces disk seeks.  On all
machines...
But yes, when I've finished mucking with this I'll be asking you to put it
all through your performance/correctness/stress tests please.
One thing which needs to be reviewed is the layout of the dentry, too.

Yup, I checked that.  Is OK.  It's hard to see how a ->d_compare
implementation could care.  And ->d_compare is called under dcache_lock
in 2.4.
