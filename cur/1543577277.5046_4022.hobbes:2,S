    The problem with [mf]sync is that we really want to write the
    page before returning back to the application.
We don't _want_ to -- we MUST. Some applications assume fsync and
fdatasync work correctly; if they do not the all bests are off.
This includes many MTAs, MDAs and databases (msync also being
important).
Looping somewhere before returning to the application is by far
better than returning when some pages have yet to be flushed.
