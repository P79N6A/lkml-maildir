I have a serious problem when usind the second head of my Matrox with the
matroxfb driver.If I login to /dev/tty0 (fb0) and then to /dev/tty6(fb1)
and make fb1 to scroll,if I switch back to /dev/tty0 and make fb0 to
scroll while fb1 is still scrolling I get a segmentation fault.Also
sometimes I get a message like this:
INIT:Id "1" respawning too fast disabled for 5 minutes.
Can anyone help me ?
