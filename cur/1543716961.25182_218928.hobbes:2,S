We're in the stable series and removing exported APIs there shoudn't happen.
Given that sock_alloc() is actually okay for every normal use I don't think
there's enough reason to remove it from the API.

Should probably be called __sock_create according to linux naming rules.
Also I guess you should actually call it from sock_create instead of
duplicating the code.
