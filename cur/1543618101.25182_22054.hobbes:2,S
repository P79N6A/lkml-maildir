A lot of times a DBMS is bulit that way because they assume they
know better than the OS designer how memory should be managed.  Same
reason they usually use raw writting the the drive instead of using
the OS calls.
Is this right or fair?  I don't know.   But it does imply that if a
VM or FS layer for an OS performs well enough, that a DBM system
might be built that would be built to take advantage of the OS's VM
and FS layer.
Ciao!
