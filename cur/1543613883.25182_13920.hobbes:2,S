Who cares about Java?  What about high performance LDAP servers or tux-like 
userspace performance?  How about faster select and poll?  An X server that 
doesn't have to make a syscall to find out that more data has arrived?  What 
about nbd or iscsi servers that are in userspace and have all the benefits 
that their kernel side counterparts do?
