The Warnings are unrelated and are because no MODULE_LICENSE tag has
been declared in each of those modules.  For each, the ALSA folks need
to put a:
	MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
in the source.  I am assuming ALSA is GPL, and has no additional
restrictions.
I'm looking over the ChangeLog for 2.4.12->2.4.13 and I don't see
anything that sticks out as "I broke ALSA!"  The ALSA team will figure
it out.
