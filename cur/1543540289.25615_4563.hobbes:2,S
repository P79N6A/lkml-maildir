The 4.0 series of Xfree86 X servers can be configured to accept input
from more than one mouse by simply describing each mouse in the
XF86Config file.  This is much cleaner than using gpm to multiplex
several mice into /dev/gpmdata.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help at all
unless you're running X, so console jockeys will still, AFAIK, need gpm.
