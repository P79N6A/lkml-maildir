Sorry for being thick-headed about this; its been a while
since my OS 101 ;-). 
You only said, to quote your first message:
        You should not acquire a semaphore with interrupts disabled.
Why not?
As far as I can see, the only problem is if the interrupt
is "locked" out trying to acquire the semaphore. This can't
happen since interrupts are disabled. But this line of
thought is probably not what you had in mind, since no
matter what code has the semaphore (interrupts disabled or
not), an interrupt should not be locked out trying to
acquire a semaphore unconditionally.

ananth.
