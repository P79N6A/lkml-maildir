Hi,
is anybody maintaining the BSD process accounting?  It's currently
broken since it still uses 16 bit uids :-(
struct acct in <linux/acct.h> contains:
/*
 *      No binary format break with 2.0 - but when we hit 32bit uid we'll
 *      have to bite one
 */
        __u16           ac_uid;                 /* Accounting Real User ID */
        __u16           ac_gid;                 /* Accounting Real Group ID */
Andreas
