I get it.
It could probably be done with a little added complexity.  For example
when a real mount is attached onto a dir-on-file mount, the
"mountedness" is propagated up to the dentry on the next real mount.
So in that case unlink won't be allowed, even if the immediate
attachment is a dir-on-file mount.
This is tricky to do right though.
Other possibility is to detach all mount trees attached to dentry on
unlink.
