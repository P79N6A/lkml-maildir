Almost.. I would add :
static int trace_switch_to_enabled;

And some code to activate the trace_switch_to_enabled variable (ideally
keeping a refcount).
By doing this, we would have the minimum impact on the scheduled when
disabled.
But remember that this trace_switch_to_enabled could be enabled for both
markers and your tracer, so you might need to put a branch at the
beginning of trace_context_switch() too.
