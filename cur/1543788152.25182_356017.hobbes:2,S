Deleting files without read/write access to them is exactly what happens
in the real world of classified information: people who physically burn
paper folders have no right to open them. :-)
Please understand one simple thing: unlink(2) system call does not
_remove_ file. It just removes one of possibly many references to this
file from an index. To erase (a part of) a file body, one uses
truncate(2) system call that --wonders!-- requires write access to the
file.
