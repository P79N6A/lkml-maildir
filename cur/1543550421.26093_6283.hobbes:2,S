Hi,
	I am trying to call execve() from within fs/binfmt_elf.c. I am fairly 
certain I am giving it the right arguments (ie. path,argv and envp). As an 
example I am referring to the use of execve in kernel/kmod.c and 
init/main.c. On kernel compilation I always get the error
"Warning: implicit declaration of execve()"
and at the end of the compilation:
fs/fs.o: undefined reference to execve.
which (AFAIK) means that it cannot find a declaration of execve. I am 
including all the .h files that are included in kmod.c (ie 
unistd,uaccess,smp_lock?, sched, etc) and yet I still get this error. Can 
anyone shine a light on this for me?
I am not on the list, so a reply to this address would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance...
dan.
