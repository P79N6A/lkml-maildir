Thanks,
hdparm -I /dev/hda didn't hang.  I got this on the console:
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04Aborted Command
I added the patch that you provided and I still get the hang when I cat
/proc/ide/hda/identify.  I put a printk In the code to make sure that it
was going through the added code, and it is. 
Mark.
