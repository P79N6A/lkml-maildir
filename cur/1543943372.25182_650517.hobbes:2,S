The point I wanted to make is that a few people have said that lawyers
say that kernel modules are derivative, but I only remember Alan saying
that he had actually spoken with the lawyers.  Therefore I infer that
this somewhat widely held opinion originates from him.  My point was to
those people who have been taking him at his word, and was to point out
that there are more reliable and transparent sources.  Don't take his
word on it.  Take the words of real experts in the law, because instead
of a mere four word conclusion, they explain everything.
