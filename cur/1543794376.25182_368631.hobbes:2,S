The latest kernels support command passthrough for SMART and the like
but hdparm -S does not "switch off" anything. It may spin a drive down
but the power consumption of 23 hours a day of "spun down" is
significant, probably more than the hour it is powered up.
Same as the problem with many household devices in standby that actually
end up using as lot of power in their many "turned off" hours
