I'm running Cyrix MII PR300 CPU, which is a bit newer than 6x86MX but I 
never noticed this :)
It says this:
Select this for an 586 or 686 series processor such as the AMD K5,
the Intel 5x86 or 6x86, or the Intel 6x86MX.  This choice does not
assume the RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter) instruction.
The "Intel 5x86 or 6x86, or the Intel 6x86MX" is wrong. Intel CPUs have 
their own CONFIG_ options. 6x86 and 6x86MX are Cyrix CPUs. AFAIK, the 
AMD 5x86 is 486-class CPU.
And I wonder if this is really the correct option for 6x86MX and MII 
CPUs...they have TSC and MMX.
