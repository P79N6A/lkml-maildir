Hi.  Back in August I sent out some patches for the aoe driver, and
Alan objected to the direct setting of skb->len in one of them.  I
asked whether he was suggesting that we use something like this
instead of setting skb->len:
	skb->data_len = 0;
	skb_trim(skb, 0);
	skb_put(skb, sizeof *h + sizeof *ah + DEFAULTBCNT);
... and Alan said that was acceptible because it takes care of
skb->tail, checks for overflow, and is more future proof.
So I took some time to implement the necessary changes, but then it
became apparent that there was a problem.
The skb_trim and skb_put macros are only for non-linear skbuffs, but
we are only using the area inside the skbuff itself for packet
headers, not data.
When we do something like this:
	if (bio_data_dir(buf->bio) == WRITE) {
		skb_fill_page_desc(skb, 0, bv->bv_page, buf->bv_off, bcnt);
		ah.aflags |= AOEAFL_WRITE;
		skb->len += bcnt;
		skb->data_len = bcnt;
		t->wpkts++;
... skb->tail isn't really relevant, because we are only using the
pre-allocated part of the skbuff for headers, and the headers aren't
expanding here.  Other parts of the kernel that aren't putting data in
the skbuff itself set the skb->len directly.
  e1000_main.c
  ip_output.c
  tcp.c
  ip6_output.c
So is it correct for the callers of skb_fill_page_desc to set skb->len
or is another interface needed besides skb_put/skb_trim?  Such a new
interface would be able to maintain the consistency of the skbuff
fields without assuming that the data is in the skbuff itself.
If a new interface is needed, then it seems like we should set
skb->len in this patch until the new interface is ready.
