You have a mixture of 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 modules in your system.  Erase
all of /lib/modules/`uname -r` and do a fresh make modules_install, but
see below first.
>Warning (compare_maps): ksyms_base symbol module_list_R__ver_module_list not found in System.map.  Ignoring ksyms_base entry
You have been caught by the broken symbol versioning in the Makefiles.
mv .config ..
make mrproper
mv ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep clean bzImage modules
rm -rf /lib/modules/<new version>
make install modules_install
reboot
