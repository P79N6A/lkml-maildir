Hi,
First of all, please CC jju@dif.dk on replies since I'm not subscribed to the 
list.
I'm testing out 2.6.0-test2 at the moment, and I've noticed that since 
switching
to this kernel I'm seeing occasional messages like this one in syslog :
Jul 30 18:17:47 dragon kernel: mtrr: 0xf0000000,0x4000000 overlaps existing 
0xf0000000,0x1000000
This is probaby not a problem, but I'm still currious as to the cause.
Can someone explain to me what the cause of this message is, and if there
is something I should do about it?
With 2.4.18 and 2.4.20 kernels I never saw this message (I don't have logs 
from other kernel versions). With the 2.4 kernels I only see these mtrr 
related
messages (which I don't see with 2.6.0-test2, but that's probably because they
have been removed) :
Jul 30 10:12:17 dragon kernel: mtrr: v1.40 (20010327) Richard Gooch 
(rgooch@atnf.csiro.au)
Jul 30 10:12:17 dragon kernel: mtrr: detected mtrr type: Intel
This machine's CPU is a 1.4GHz AMD Athlon (Thumderbird) and the 
motherboard is a ASUS A7M266.
If further details are of interrest, then just ask and I'll provide whatever 
info you need.
Kind regards,
Jesper Juhl <jju@dif.dk>
