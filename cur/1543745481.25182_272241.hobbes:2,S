I don't see how this makes more problems to userspace filesystems.
When you clear GFP_IO or GFP_FS for an allocation you are limiting
yourself from freeing some sort of memory.  But that will not make it
easier to actually _get_ that memory.
With FUSE the allocation is NOT limited.  Deadlock will not happen
since page writeback is non-blocking, so while more FUSE backed pages
can't be written, other filesystem's pages can be written back.  The
situation is better not worse.
What am I missing?
Thanks,
Miklos
