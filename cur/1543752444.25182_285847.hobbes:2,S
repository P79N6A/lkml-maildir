The same is true of PCMCIA cards as well.

I believe the MMC "specification" with its power on times and minimum
number of clocks are supposed to take care of the insertion.  However,
see below.

That depends whether the hardware already provides 0.5s of debounce
already.  Some people do, some people don't.  This is why it needs to
be left to the implementation and not a core issue.

That's probably the official MMC specification from the MMC forum.  Us
mere open source developers don't have access to such costly specs, so
we have to make do with the specs released by card manufacturers which
do go into the protocol sufficiently deeply.
Unfortunately, such specs only cover MMC cards and not SD cards.

This was added because someone was seeing a problem.  There is no
specified delay required by "specifications" I've seen to date.

I have no idea - and that's the big problem.  We just don't know
what the situation is with SD.
Maybe now that it's more wildly known that there's SD support available
from handhelds.org, maybe (if the SD forum are reading lkml) we'll see
some reaction.  Let's just hope it's positive.
