I agree with this. Without these, we're nowhere.
(and not even a debugger will help you)
I've planned a cleanup of some VM code for 2.5
and will do my utmost best to make sure the code
becomes more readable and better documented.
Also, I'm willing to help people write documentation
on any part of the kernel I know. I'm a bit too busy
to write a lot of documention myself, but I'll gladly
explain things to the people who will be writing docs.
regards,
Rik
