Hi,
I'd like to thank all those that responded. Unfortunately, I was not
very patient and already bought something before most of you responded.
That's my fault.
So, this is what I'm getting:
ATI (Connect3D) Radeon X800 GTO 256MB GDDR3/PCI-E/VIVO/DVI (Retail Box)
For $179 at Monarch computer.
Gerhard Mack recommended avoiding the PCI-E since there is no support
yet for DRI.  Right now I don't care about that (thinking it will be
supported in the future) and all that I read was to go with the PCI-E
instead of the AGP. I could be wrong.
I'll keep the list posted of problems/solutions that I come across with
this card.
Thanks,
-- Steve
