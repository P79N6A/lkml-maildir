It is just one more variable and the assignment and one more test for this
variable, is that so bad?
Even if Apple fixes that (unlikely, given that PUSH is part of the TCP
protocol), it will probably take a long time until all the Macs are
upgraded, if they upgrade at all. May be the problem disappears in MacOS
X general release iff they keep the current MacOS X server BSD based
TCP stack which ignores PUSH on the input side.
