Hi,
I noticed today that I had several "spurious 8259A interrupt":
Dec 20 15:02:45 hermes vmunix: spurious 8259<3>[drm:radeon_cp_init]
*ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held
...
Dec 20 16:54:17 hermes vmunix: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
...
Jan  3 11:29:06 hermes vmunix: spurious 8259A interrupt: I<6>cs: memory
probe 0xa0000000-0xa0ffffff: clean.
...
Feb 29 12:59:39 hermes vmunix: spurious 8259A in<4>atkbd.c: Keyboard on
isa0060/serio0 reports too many keys pressed.
...
Mar  1 00:03:12 hermes vmunix: spurious 8259A interrupt:
I<3>[drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init called without lock held
...
Mar  8 03:11:24 hermes vmunix: spurious 8259A interrupt:
I<7>orinoco_lock() called with hw_unavailable (dev=d5a80000)
After some Googling, I found out this:
http://test.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/#spurious-8259A-interrupt
So, I know it is no harm. But, it is possibly due to a device driver
which is not properly doing its job. Can somebody tell me how to correct
this bug (without have the work around of tingling klogd).
Regards
