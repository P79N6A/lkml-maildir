There is no 'bus error' on any ix86 machines. Reading nonexistant memory
will not hurt anything. Once in protected mode, all ix86 machines can
access memory as 'pages'. There will never be a partial page. A page
in ix86-land is 0x1000 bytes. Since the bad BIOSes are in ix86 machines,
a memory-check that is ix86-specific can be readily made.
To find the memory limit, you need to set a data selector to map
1:1 physical memory. Then, with the interrupts disabled, save the
last longword in each page into a register. Invert it, then write
it back. Exercise the bus by pushing, then poping any register, then
read the longword. If it is what you wrote, memory exists. Put the
original longword back, then go to the next page. You do this until
the test fails. The memory is thus determined. This will work even if you
end up modifying your own code because what you execute has already been
prefetched. To assure success, with modifying code, you need to do the
modification at a 2-byte boundary which keeps you off the end of a cache-
line, i.e.: 
		This is Intel syntax
		dest <-- source
		push ds		; Save segment
		mov ds, _linear_selector
		xor ebx, ebx	; Start with zero
	chkm:	mov eax [ebx]	; Get memory DWORD
		mov ecx, eax	; Save
		not eax		; Invert
		nop
		align 2		; Get off DWORD boundary
		not [ebx]	; Invert memory byte
		push eax	; Exercise the bus
		pop  eax
		cmp eax, [ebx]	; See if it took
		mov [ebx], ecx	; Put original back
		jz  end_of_mem	; No memory here
		add ebx,1000h	; Ready next page
		jmp short chkm
	end_of_mem:
		pop ds		; Restore segment
				; EBX = 1000h past last good memory
This code is "swiped" from something working that I did for one of
our scanners which has no BIOS, etc. With Linux, you can assume that
your code (which is executing) must be in RAM, therefore you can
start above your code if you don't like the idea of modifying your
own instruction-stream. But, if the code is written as shown, by
the time the cache is refetched (because of the detected write), it
will have been changed back to the original.
This takes only 2-3 seconds to execute on a 128 megabyte 400 MHz machine.
Cheers,
