2.4.2 works fine.
2.4.5-pre5 won't get past fsck of /dev/md0 -- locks up towards the end.  I'm
running the same kernel on two other machine (different motherboards though)
I'm using gcc-3.0 and glibc-2.2.3
/dev/md0 is a dual-IDE RAID1 (2nd drive is currently disabled)
md0 : active raid1 hda1[0]
      39082560 blocks [2/1] [U_]
Under 2.4.2 boot fsck ends
/dev/md0 was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.
/dev/md0: x/x files (x% non-contiguous), x/x blocks
But under 2.4.5-pre5 it doesn't get past the first "check forced" message.
It just locks up completely after it runs for a couple of minutes.
Motherboard is SuperMicro 370dl3
Disk WDC WD400BB-00AUA1
