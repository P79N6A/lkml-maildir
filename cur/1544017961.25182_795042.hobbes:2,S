Ok, I understand you. You want to decrease kthreadd latency. In this case
your suggestion is right.

I also have intent to make kthread_run/kthread_create more easy used for
threads that exit himself on error.
For example, we create some thread THR, which does something but exits on error.
So in normal case we need to call kthread_stop() to stop thread THR, but on
error we don't. This is a problem, because we can't simple (without race) 
determine that THR was exited.
Simple workaround - do a sleeping loop in thread THR and don't exit until kthread_should_stop.
But it isn't a good for code reading/writing.
So my suggestion is: Move workaround sleeping logic from THR to low level
functions:
   wait for a kthread_should_stop in kthread() if THR was exited.
Of course don't wait if nobody cares about thread THR (nobody calls kthread_stop()
for this thread).
That do you think about it?
