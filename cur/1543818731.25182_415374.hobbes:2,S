So in order for you not to shudder the vrf people have to write a GPL'd
program or convince someone else to write one?
That sounds .. really odd.
Or more to the point, someone ONLY writes kernelmode stuff, doesn't
touch userspace at all. A proprietary app shows up that uses it,
and all of a sudden this guy's kernelmode whatever is disliked
cause noone wrote any GPL'd program for it?
That's almost forcing the person who wrote the kernel part to write
a GPL'd program JUST because there is a proprietary program using
his stuff - and THAT is insane.
