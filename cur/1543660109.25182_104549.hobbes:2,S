it appears it is this code in rpc_lookup_negative() that returns -EEXIST
I added a debug-printk and it was printed.
        if (dentry->d_inode) {
                dput(dentry);
                dentry = ERR_PTR(-EEXIST);
                goto out_err;
        }

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
