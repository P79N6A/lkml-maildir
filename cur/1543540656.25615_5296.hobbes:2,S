No I did not. If the writer had said they he had found a way to bypass
user limits then I would have been more receptive. However, merely
submitting some code that will run the system out of memory and
stating that it will lock up the system, left no hint that he was
using user limits. Also, where did you find that he was using a
special malloc()?  DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD on glibc-2.0.6 that I have the
source for is 128 * 1024. His code does not magically hit a boundary.
