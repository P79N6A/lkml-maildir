	For in-kernel OOM, this makes sense. For a pro-active user-land
version, we would start warning at a low-water mark, and
killing at some high water mark.

	Cache is not included in my VM measurement. It's just
pages currently allocated to processes.

	90% of RAM is used. 
	(In case I haven't been clear, when I say ``X% of VM'' I
mean:
X% = (pages used by processes in MEM + pages used by processes in SWAP)
     ------------------------------------------------------------------ * 100
	 (total pages of MEM + total pages of SWAP)
	Clear as mud?
