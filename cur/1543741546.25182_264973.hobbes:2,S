Strangely, or even twilight zone stuff, I am building right now and will boot 
new kernel with the CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC = n - this fixes it reportedly.  Only 
warnings anyway, but I think we all like *clean* boots.
A couple of mails with Bartlomiej assured me that it isn't required on 
modern(ish) machines that have PCI (in theory), so do not need that option.
That will stop the probe, and the post from Alan re the Redhat thread suggests 
it is a debug warning anyway that maybe was never removed.
