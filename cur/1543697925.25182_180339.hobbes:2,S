Thanks to Linux and modules! I find that the detailed logging sent by
modules as they are loaded is generally very helpful.
When dealing with unknown or misbehaving hardware, be it soundcards, USB
gadgets, FireWire camcorders or whatever, compiling all relevant drivers
as modules and experimenting with modprobe often gives new insights and
with any luck you'll even find the setup that makes it work! ;-)
