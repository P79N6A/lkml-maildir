AFAICT, there is nothing stopping us from redoing the kernel ABI to
pass the first few parameters between kernel functions in registers.
As long as the syscall interface is unchanged, that ABI change will
only break binary modules (care_factor == 0).  The ABI type would need
to be added to the symbol version prefix, trivial.
