Hello,
I have been trying to suspend and resume a device in runtime using the 
/sys/devices/pci.../power/state interface.
First time the device suspend/resume works correctly.
But since, during resume the power_state is not set for the device(as is 
done during suspend), it still retains the old suspended state value.
Because of which, it can't be suspended again. (kernel thinks its 
already suspended)
This can be fixed by just setting the dev->power.power_state to 
appropriate value in drivers/base/power/runtime.c:runtime_resume() or in 
any other suitable place.
Regards,
Bharata.
