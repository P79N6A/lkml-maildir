This series addresses the problem of showing mount options in
/proc/mounts.
Several filesystems which use mount options, have not implemented a
.show_options superblock operation.  Several others have implemented
this callback, but have not kept it fully up to date with the parsed
options.
Q: Why do we need correct option showing in /proc/mounts?
A: We want /proc/mounts to fully replace /etc/mtab.  The reasons for
   this are:
    - unprivileged mounters won't be able to update /etc/mtab
    - /etc/mtab doesn't work with private mount namespaces
    - /etc/mtab can become out-of-sync with reality
Q: Can't this be done, so that filesystems need not bother with
   implementing a .show_mounts callback, and keeping it up to date?
A: Only in some cases.  Certain filesystems allow modification of a
   subset of options in their remount_fs method.  It is not possible
   to take this into account without knowing exactly how the
   filesystem handles options.
For the simple case (no remount or remount resets all options) the
patchset introduces two helpers:
  generic_show_options()
  save_mount_options()
These can also be used to emulate the old /etc/mtab behavior, until
proper support is added.  Even if this is not 100% correct, it's still
better than showing no options at all.
The following patches fix up most in-tree filesystems, they have been
compile tested only.  I would like to ask maintainers (CC-d on
respective patches) to please review, test and ACK these changes.
The following filesystems still need fixing: CIFS, NFS, XFS, Unionfs,
Reiser4.  For CIFS, NFS and XFS I wasn't able to understand how some
of the options are used.  The last two are not yet in mainline, so I
leave fixing those to their respective maintainers out of pure
laziness.

+Mount Options
+=============
+
+Parsing options
+---------------
+
+On mount and remount the filesystem is passed a string containing a
+comma separated list of mount options.  The options can have either of
+these forms:
+
+  option
+  option=value
+
+The <linux/parser.h> header defines an API that helps parse these
+options.  There are plenty of examples on how to use it in existing
+filesystems.
+
+Showing options
+---------------
+
+If a filesystem accepts mount options, it must define show_options()
+to show all the currently active options.  The rules are:
+
+  - options MUST be shown which are not default or their values differ
+    from the default
+
+  - options MAY be shown which are enabled by default or have their
+    default value
+
+Options used only internally between a mount helper and the kernel
+(such as file descriptors), or which only have an effect during the
+mounting (such as ones controlling the creation of a journal) are exempt
+from the above rules.
+
+A simple method of saving options at mount/remount time and showing
+them is provided with the save_mount_options() and
+generic_show_options() helper functions.  Please note, that using
+these may have drawbacks.  For more info see header comments for these
+functions in fs/namespace.c.
