When last we left our heros, they were speaking of:
 	I tried recompiling with the CPU type set to 586 this morning,
and got the same results, as well as when I tried adding mem=224m on the 
lilo boot command line.  No go.  :-<  Anyone else have advice?  I'm beginning 
to wonder if maybe it isn't a processor or MoBo problem, but I don't want to 
spend the money for a new one right now, so I'm hoping somebody will have some
other suggestions.
