In my experience with scheduling OSS drivers for removal, users simply 
use the OSS drivers unless you tell them very explicitely that the OSS 
driver will go.
It shouldn't be too hard to port the support to ALSA if someone with the  
hardware is willing to test patches.
The goal is to get people still using OSS drivers where ALSA drivers 
support the same hardware to use the ALSA drivers - and if there were 
bugs in the ALSA drivers preventing them to switch to ALSA, to report 
them to the ALSA bug tracking system.
This has the following advantages:
- better ALSA drivers
- get rid of some unmaintained code in the kernel
