There are no contradiction, can you believe it or not :-)

Ok. "Technical merit". What's "technical merit" ? If we want to grade thing
by "technical merit" we need some way to measure that "technical merit", right ?
Ok. So far ultimate way to measure "technical merit" was via Linus's
aesthetic sense. You may think it's poor way to measure "technical merit"
but it's how it's measured for linux. Last few years showed that this
method works quite well and so we need REAL STRONG proof that any other way
it better.

Yeah ? And THIS IS not try to convinience Linus to include patch ? Gosh.

Linus feel it's worthwhile goal. It's enough. What we need now is not
"more peoples who would understand the benefits to general community"
but "more peoples who can generate more clean CODE to lower latency".
It's diffrent thing.

And if there are exist good proof that such functions are INDEED non-fixable
in any other way then via addition of pre-emption points and that we INDEED
NEED such latency objectives in THAT TIME this ONE pre-emption point is
justified and not arbitrary anymore. We have such proof for read/write
user-copy code. All other points are arbitrary (till not proved otherwise).

Not exactly. Other way is to redesign some linux's subsystem in such way that
said functions are not needed in first place. It's hard but not harder then
to maintain code with 10'000 pre-emption points. Where the border lies ?
Where Linus will put it as usual :-)

And some will not: "X number of bytes squeezing into the ISA bus takes
Y amount of time."

You [almost] sufficiently imaginative :-)

1. There are MUCH less locks in UP kernel then in SMP kernel. EXACTLY since
   resheduling can not occur in arbitrary point.
2. Yes, you are right about critical code. You just forget one simple thing:
   critical code is not one blob. It can call other functions. Thus such
   pre-emption points add additional load on maintainers: now they should
   keep in mind that some functions can not be called from critical code
   anymore - directly or indirectly. You do not need 10'000 pre-emption
   points to make maintainers life miserable. You need way less.

Translation: Solar Designer's patches add A LOT OF band-aids. Hmm. And THIS
means it should be included in mainstream kernel ? Are you joking ot what ?

Non-exec stack WILL NOT be included in kernel. Linus said it clear enough.
Other parts can be considered. Some of them can be in fact not even band-aids.
But who should do this separation and clean up ?

Translation: it'll help us for few weeks and will add cruft in kernel FOREVER.
No, thnx.

It will not sit in non-swapable kernel space. It will not add load on kernel
maintainers. It's big win.

Then port stackguard on new GCC and do not use precompiled binaries. Not kernel
issue at all. What's feasible to do in userspace, should be done in userspace.

VERY true. And even less security mechanisms are good enough to go in kernel.

And THAT'S why you said it does not create deadlocks ? And THAT'S why you
argued that it must be an option in standart kernel ? Gosh...

Yeah, they will. If there are exist some peoples who NEED low latency then we
can hope that there will be some peoples who NEED it badly enough to dig deep
in kernel and develop proper solution. If some suboptimal solution is part of
kernel then chance to find such person will be MUCH lower - what for if it's
already handled somehow ?

It was my words. Perhaps I've formulated it slightly non-optimal. I've talked
not about low-latency needs but about patch here. So far we have only one way
to get low-latency: with said patches. And since it's "the only game in town"
we have to live with it. But it's quite possible that in long terms this
problem will be solved in some other, completely unrelated way. If deep and
carefull investigation of problem will show that it's THE ONLY way to handle
low-latence problem THEN we can think about it's adoption by mainstream
kernel.

It's fate of ANY big (destined to be alive tens of years) project. If you
are chosing functionality over clear design then suddenly in just few years
(sometimes even LESS THEN IN YEAR) you have system without functionality and
without clean design: "this beast HAS all bells and whisltes imaginable at
akk! just you need 100000000MHz processor and 100000GiB of RAM to run it"
(little exaggeration but you got the idea).

Of course :-) I've not seen prof of otherwise in said patch and without
proof it's so by default.

It does not make adoption of said patch worthwhile. And said effort DOES NOT
belong to 2.4 kernel in code-freeze phase. It's 2.5 project (if there are
enough volunteers, of course).
P.S. You raised quetion about adoption of low latency patch in the same letter
as question about Solar Designer's patch thus showing that you are clueless:
it was discussed quite a few times why Solar Designer patches are not acceptable
for mainstream kernel and if you think low latency patch is somewhat like
Solar Designer patch that why the hell you STILL asking about it's inclusion ?
