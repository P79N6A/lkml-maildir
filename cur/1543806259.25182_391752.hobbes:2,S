Well, grepping through fs/partitions/*.c, the 'flags' thing is set by
 efi.c, msdos.c sgi.c sun.c
Of these, efi compares something against PARTITION_LINUX_RAID_GUID,
and msdos.c, sgi.c and sun. compare something against
LINUX_RAID_PARTITION.
The former would look like
  e6d6d379-f507-44c2-a23c-238f2a3df928
in sysfs (I think);
The latter would look like
  fd
(I suspect).
These are both easily recognisable with no real room for confusion.
And if other partition styles wanted to add support for raid auto
detect, tell them "no". It is perfectly possible and even preferable
to live without autodetect.   We should support legacy usage (those
above) but should discourage any new usage.
