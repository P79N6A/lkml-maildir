    I'd rather just see that message go away;  If the limitations on
    a.out binaries stop them from loading (the blocksize messages), I
    *do* want to see them, but if they executables are in a unfavored
    state but still work without error, I want the kernel to just STFU.
    How many people, aside from the small cohort that use Mastodon,
    actually have any a.out binaries on their machines anymore?  I'd say
    it's a very safe bet that anyone who is using a.out binaries now is
    doing it deliberately, and thus doesn't need those helpful reminders
    convert their system to all ELF.
