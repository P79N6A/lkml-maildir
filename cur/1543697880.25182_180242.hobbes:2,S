Also, anyone interested in doing this should probably re-read the thread
on netdev from a couple months back about this, since we hashed out some
implementation details wrt SMP efficiency:

Although reading this thread I'm feeling that Andi is probably right -
are there really any apps that coudn't cope with a small inaccuracy of the
first ioctl-fetched timestamp?  I really doubt it.  Basically there's
two common cases:
  1. System under reasonably network load: in this case the tcpdump (or
     whatever) probably will get the packet soon after it arrived, so
     the timestamp we compute for the first packet won't be very far off.
  2. System under heavy network load: the card's hardware rx queues are
     probably pretty full so our timestamps won't be very accurate
     no matter what we do
Given that the timestamp is already inexact it seems like a fine idea to
trade a tiny amount of accuracy for a potentially significant performance
improvement.
