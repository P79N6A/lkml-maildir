I only had to upgrade my DHCP and PPP software.

I don't mess with huge software packages that lack decent safety nets.
LILO makes it easy to drop back to a known good kernel. If I upgrade
binutils to something that won't work, I have a fairly serious problem.
The only thing worse is a bad libc.
I do not remember ever needing a tool upgrade to compile Linux.
I've been running Linux since the 1.0.x days, generally keeping
my development tools for a couple of years.

AT&T does not make x86 processors. Traditional UNIX hackers don't do
16-bit Intel assembly. You might as well argue about VAX assembly
syntax with an IBM mainframe hacker. AT&T is irrelevant here.

NASM is no problem at all. If the install fails, I can compile it again.
With a binutils upgrade, a failed install means I have to find my CD-ROM.

binutils (the version you want) is not likely to be installed.
Not even Red Hat 6.0 has what you want, and I don't see why I should
have to bother with that anyway.

One of the boot code authors has already posted his approval, so I'd
say this is acceptable to old x86 hackers. Go right ahead. NASM is an
easy upgrade, since nothing else depends on it working correctly.
