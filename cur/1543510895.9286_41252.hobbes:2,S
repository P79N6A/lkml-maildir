The principle shit in - shit out quite reasonably applies to both,
eventhough there are quite a lot of nasty bugs in xconfig (or at least
missing features)...
It's better to fix the Config.in files than to blame menuconfig/xconfig
each time... After all, we don't blame make if there are errors in the
Makefile's.
Then again, it would be nice if menuconfig did a proper bug-report, not
just a "there seems to be an error". By this I mean that it should report
what file the bug is in.
