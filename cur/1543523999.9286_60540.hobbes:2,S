Per Alan and Manfred, pulling the daemonize() code into it (it's currently a
2.2 module) looks like it will do the trick, as the kernel thread then
"becomes one with init". :)  Yes, it needed to change it's name in
current->comm, and close open file descriptors, but daemonize() should work
nicely.
Thanks to everyone for their help!

If that's the problem, then the driver is also failing to write a
meaninful name into the proper space for display on ps listings.
