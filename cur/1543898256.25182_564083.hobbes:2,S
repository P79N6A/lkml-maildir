I did both pte_dirty and pte_write because I was extra careful. One
_should_ imply the other, but since we'll be clearing both, I thought it
prudent to also check both.
I will have to think on this a little more, but I'm currently of the
opinion that the optimisation is not correct. But I'll have a thorough
look at s390 again when I get home.
