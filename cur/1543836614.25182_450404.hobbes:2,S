Subject: [patch 2.6.18-rc3] RTC class, Kconfig improvements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/4/374

Small updates to make the RTC class Kconfig text be more informative.
This should help folk used to the drivers/char/rtc.c support, or a
single RTC, be slightly less surprised by the differences.
