Subject: [patch] Real-Time Preemption, -VP-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U2

Precedence: bulk

i have released the -U2 PREEMPT_REALTIME patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U2
this too is a bugfixes-only release, and it is still experimental code.
Changes since -U1:
 - bugfix: fix page_lock_anon_vma() crash reported by Adam Heath and 
   Lorenzo Allegrucci.
 - bugfix: fix selinux atomic-schedule warning messages, reported by
   Mark H Johnson.
 - bugfix: ip_tables atomic-schedule fix, fixes the messages reported by 
   Daniel Walker and K.R. Foley.
 - bugfix: fix warnings/deadlocks in inet_create(), reported by Mark H 
   Johnson.
 - bugfix: fixed a crash-in-shmfs-during-heavy-swapout bug
 - bugfix: enable preemption while doing mmdrop() in the scheduler - it 
   may schedule.
 - debugging feature: when PREEMPT_TIMING is enabled then the code also 
   keeps a trace/stack of preemption enabler EIPs. (if LATENCY_TRACE is 
   enabled as well then the parent EIP is recorded as well.) Whenever a 
   stack trace due to atomicity violations is printed, the preemption
   stack is printed as well. This makes it much easier to identify the 
   place that did the illegal preemption-disabling.
to create a -U2 tree from scratch the patching order is:
