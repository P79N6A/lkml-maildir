Marcelo,
Here are some dbench numbers, from the "for what it's worth" department.
This was done with SMP kernels, on a dual p3 box, SCSI disk, ext2.
The first column is dbench clients.  The numbers are throughput
in MB/sec.  The 2.5.29 kernel had a few RR-supplied smp fixes.
Looks like for this limited test, 2.4.19-rc5 holds up pretty well.
I've also ran this set of tests several times on -rc5 using ext3
and data=writeback, and everything looks fine.
