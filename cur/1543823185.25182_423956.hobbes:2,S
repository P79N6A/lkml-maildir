I'll be darned.  I never knew it was even possible to run x86 numa kernels
on non-numa boxen.  I'd have tested about 1000000 of Christoph Lameter's
patches if someone had told me.  Yes, it's useful.

True.
I guess the concern here is that we don't want people building these
frankenkernels and then sending us bug reports against them.
So it is perhaps reasonable to do this panic, but only if !CONFIG_EMBEDDED? 
(It really is time to start renaming CONFIG_EMBEDDED to CONFIG_DONT_DO_THIS
or something).
