OK, from the kernels point of view this might be correct. The problem is
that none of the failing applications have been mine... sendmail 8.9.0 
and several different POP3 daemons. So either all these are broken or the 
kernel has failed to notifies the applications.  Shouldn't the socket send
an EOF to the application if the peer terminates?

In most cases, I have no idea.  But in all cases I have known about the
peer OS, it has been MacOS...

No activity.
