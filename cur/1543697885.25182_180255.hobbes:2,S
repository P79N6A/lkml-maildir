(Among the other N objections, add things like the lack of any sort of
control or option parameters)
...
N += 1: Sparse Copying (e.g. seeking past blocks of zeros)
N += 1: Unlink or overwrite or what?
N += 1: In-Kernel locking and resolution for pages that are mandatory
lock(ed)
N += 1: No fine-grained control for concurrency issues (multiple writers)
Start with doing a cp --help and move on from there for an unbounded list of
issues that sys_copy(int fd1, int fd2) does not even come close to
addressing.
