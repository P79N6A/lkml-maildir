Well, because of his classy hair-style of course.
Seriously, Linux is not managed by a committee. There is nobody to
appoint Official File System Reviewers of Her Majesty. Everything here

 still features
only mongo runs with overwrite/modify phases off and with all operations
done in readdir order (most favorable mode for reiser4).
