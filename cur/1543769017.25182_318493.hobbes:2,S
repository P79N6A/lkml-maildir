Hi All,
I've a dual Xeon 3.2GHz HT with 8GB of memory running kernel 2.6.11.
I whould like to know the way how to use all the memory in a single
process, the application is a big simulation which needs big memory chuncks.
I have readed about hugetlbfs, shmfs and tmpfs, but don't understand how I 
can access
the whole memory. Ok! I can create a big file on tmpfs using shm_open() and
than map it by using mmap() or mmap2() but how can I access over 4GB using
standard pointers (if I had to use it)?
So, please send me some url, documents etc and/or piece
of source code that shows how to do it in user space.
Thanks _very much_ in advance,
Roberto Fichera.
