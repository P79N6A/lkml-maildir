In this piece of code I convert seconds and microseconds in 
milliseconds. I think the problem is not in my code, in fact I wrote the 
following piece of code in Java, and it does not work too. In the for 
loop the 90% of times b > a while for 10% of times not.
    class Prova {
          public static void main(....) {
               for (;;) {
                    long a = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    long b = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    if (a > b) {
                         System.out.println("Wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!");
                    }
               }
          }
    }
