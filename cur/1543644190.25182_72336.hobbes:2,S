The GC is generational and incremental, so it must deal with a lot of short
term objects that need to be collected. GC performance is a sore point in the
JVM (language runtimes in general) and having slow access to this is potentially
crippling for high load machines. The HotSpot/JVM is a bit overzealous with
safepoints which opens this area to optimization, but the problem exists now.

It's better to have an explict pthread_suspend_[thread,all]() function
since this kind of thing is becoming more and more common in thread
heavy language runtimes. The Posix thread spec was build without regard
to this and it's definitely become an important issues these days.

Don't remember off hand, but it's like to be several times a second which is
often enough to be a problem especially on large systems with high load.
The JVM with incremental GC is being targetted for media oriented tasks
using the new NIO, 3d library, etc... slowness in safepoints would cripple it
for these tasks. It's a critical item and not easily address by the current
1:1 model.
