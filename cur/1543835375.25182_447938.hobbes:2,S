My box builds my ordinary .config (attached) in under 5min :
$ time make -j3
real    3m58.047s
user    4m54.574s
sys     1m24.202s
Here are some more numbers for you to compare to your box :
allnoconfig :
$ make clean
$ make allnoconfig
$ time make -j3
real    0m54.544s
user    1m2.113s
sys     0m20.781s
allmodconfig :
$ make clean
$ make allmodconfig
$ time make -j3
real    28m49.748s
user    35m3.212s
sys     10m43.633s
This box uses a Athlon64 X2 4400+ CPU, has 2GB RAM and a single
Ultra160 SCSI disk.
It's currently running an i386 kernel, not x86_64, so it's probably
not performing to it's full potential atm.

Make sure you have a fast disk and adequate amounts of RAM so you
don't end up swapping, then add more CPU's.
A dual-core box is not too expensive these days and an additional core
really speeds things up. If you have the money for it, then a box with
two dual-core CPU's is ofcourse even better.
If you have several machines, then you can use distcc
(
http://distcc.samba.org/
) to distribute the build across the boxes -
that's an easy way to speed things up if you have a bunch of older
computers lying around.
