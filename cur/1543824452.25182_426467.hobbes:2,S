I'd never advocate just killing a functioning system. What I've been talking 
about is building a new system that sits alongside the existing one in the 
tree, depends on EXPERIMENTAL and BROKEN in the Kconfig system and takes the 
place of the traditional framebuffer system if someone decides to use it.
I say have it depend on BROKEN because that should keep the masses away from 
it while it's being heavily tested, and I say it should sit alongside the 
existing code and be *new* for exactly the reason you've pointed out. 
Modifying the existing systems to integrate the new technology would require 
either changing the driver model or a lot fo dirty hacks. Neither seems that 
good of an option to me.
