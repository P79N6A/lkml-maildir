Posix or not I still don't see why one would want that. You know what you 
are going to be using a file for at open time and you are not going to be 
changing your mind later. If you can show me a single _real_world_ example 
where one would genuinely want to change from one access pattern to another 
without closing/reopening a particular file I would agree that fadvise is a 
good idea but otherwise I think open(2) is the superior approach.
In addition, open(2) allows you to do cool things like O_TEMP which could 
create a file that would never get written to disk at all and on close 
would just disappear again (just an idea, I can see good uses for such 
things, although in a way we already have simillar semantics when one 
creates such files on a tmpfs mount).
Best regards,
Anton
