Working on these (they're all in bugzilla), more help needed of course
:)

No the problem is the ACPI irq routing code is trying to piggyback on
the existing MPS-specific data structures, and it's generally a hack. So
yes mochel is right, but it is also purging MPS-ities from common code
as well. I've done some preliminary work in this area and it doesn't
seem to break anything (yet) but a rewrite in this area imho should not
be rushed out the door. And, I think the above bugs can be fixed w/o the
rewrite.
