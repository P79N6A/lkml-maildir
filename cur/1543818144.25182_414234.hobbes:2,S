Hi,
What is the best way to let C preprocessor to parse all the
kernel source files to resolve #ifdef's after I have configured the
kernel?
There are many Makefiles in the sources, I dont want to modify each one of them.
Indiviually files i can do cc -E.
I would like to have the preproccessed output to be stored in
the format filename.X
ie each file compile must have a filename.X
This would be useful. am not sure how to do it.
I know it has something to do with shell programming. But i feel this
is the right place to ask because some of you might have done this
before.
Any help will be highly appreciated.
thanks and regards,
sriram
