This discussion comes up every once in a while. I'm using an old FC7 compiler
(gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-27)) And tests show that when the layout
of a structure is exactly the same the "__packed" on structure declarations does
nothing. It only starts to affect when there are real differences in alignment.
Also tests with gcc 3.4.x showed the same effect.
On previous discussions no one could come forward and say what compiler version
breaks when __packed is applied on structure definition. I'm afraid your statement
above is a myth.
