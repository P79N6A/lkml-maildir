i have released the -V0.7.21 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this release includes fixes and debugging-improvements.
Changes since -V0.7.20:
 - reverted the modlist_lock change - it caused more problems than it 
   solved.
 - implemented irqs-off critical section timing/tracing, inspired by the 
   positive results Thomas Gleixner got with a different kind of cli/sti
   tracer. To activate it, enable CONFIG_CRITICAL_TIMING and 
   CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING and cli/sti latencies will be reported
   'integrated' into the preempt on/off latencies.
 - sped up tracing in a number of ways. Performance of the tracer slowly
   eroded in the past week or two, it needed alignment and size fixes ,
   inlining/branch-prediction updates and i got rid of unnecessary code.
   The max latency is now traced in cycles - this got rid of an
   expensive 64-bit division in the fastpath. (the /proc/sys tunables
   are still in usecs so userspace should not notice anything.) It's
   still not cheap but roughly 5 times faster than -V0.7.20's tracer, on
   a fast desktop box.
 - renamed CONFIG_PREEMPT_REALTIME to CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT - it's shorter.
 - renamed CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMING to CONFIG_CRITICAL_TIMING and 
   introduced CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING to enable cli/sti timing.
