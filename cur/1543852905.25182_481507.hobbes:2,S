Yes, I wanted to keep a low profile because it would involve several
drivers. So I wanted to work out the basic class with Nicolas, whom I
added to Cc: and who's written the accelerator driver for the MacBooks,
and then contact the other maintainers. The idea was to have something
concrete, not just a concept to discuss.
But since Nicolas is really busy since months, I'd say the submitted
code can go in. I'll then make a patch which adds the class.

So do I, at least without the harddisk protection.

Yeah, I was waiting for Nicolas' answer again, so it got stuck here,
too.
