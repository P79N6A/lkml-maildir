No, that's fine ... the reason scsi_ioctl.c moved to block was precisely
so that non SCSI devices could use the ioctls, thus it should be there
even if SCSI is not.

I generally use quilt to help with this (just quilt up the fix and apply
and remove it around the bisects).  I seem to get tons of trees with
unrelated breakage right around where the voyager failures are.
