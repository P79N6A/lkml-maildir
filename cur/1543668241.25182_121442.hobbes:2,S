This isn't actually such a clear-cut situation.  Statically mapped
sockets like SA11x0-based stuff are able to access the card with no
resources loaded - in fact, there are no resources to be loaded.
One of my patches (which was the troublesome pcmcia-10 patch from akpm's
patch set) changes the way we deal with the CIS.  For windowed sockets,
when a card detected, we immediately try to claim a resource for the CIS
window.  If this fails, we whinge about "PCMCIA: insert failed" but
continue anyway.  We could fail at this point.
When resources are changed, I simulate a card removal + insertion request
so that the CIS gets re-setup.  The longer term solution, imho, is to
change the socket setup/reset/unreset code in cs.c to be more of a state
machine which could be re-started when resources become available.

I'm not completely sure we want to add a device in this case - if we don't
have any resources, there isn't much point in making the device available
to drivers.

I have a memory-type pcmcia card here, and I believe it doesn't have any
CIS what so ever, so this would fail.
