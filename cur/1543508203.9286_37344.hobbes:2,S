Oh well, you've got lots of company. Like Microsoft.
For unix the "ctime" on the inode is, and always has been, the time of
the last change to the inode or file. It was never the creation time.
It's in there specifically for incremental backups AIUI.

This wouldn't even hold if it was the Create time, the modified time can
and is set to _anything_ by tools like zip and tar.

Not always, an append will not change the accessed time.
