Bear in mind that it could be CONFIG'ed out, so you can still do as you
choose. But for many people, the ability to get insight into their
application's interaction with the kernel and get several % performance
improvement by understanding their environment will outweigh the 0.01%
overhead of a few nops.
IME, most performance problems are not little tiny instruction-cycle
level things, they're huge sucking wounds that people just don't know
how to fix, or that they even exist (such as "oops, I single-threaded
all my IO from my app").
