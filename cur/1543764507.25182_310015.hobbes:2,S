Yes, there's no reason why not at that point.

I think the _right_ answer here is to have two separate checkpoint
lists: the current one, plus one for which the checkpoint write has
already been submitted.  That way, we can wait for IO completion on
submitted writes without (a) getting conned into doing multiple rewrites
if there's somebody else dirtying the buffer; or (b) getting confused
about how much progress we're making.  Buffers on the pre-write list get
written; buffers on the post-write list get waited for; and both count
as progress (eliminating the false assert-failure when we failed to
detect progress).
The prevention of multiple writes in this case should also improve
performance a little.
That ought to be pretty straightforward, I think.  The existing cases
where we remove buffers from a checkpoint shouldn't have to care about
which list_head we're removing from; those cases already handle buffers
in both states.  It's only when doing the flush/wait that we have to
distinguish the two.
Sounds good?
