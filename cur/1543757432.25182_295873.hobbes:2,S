BK already feeds patches out at the head, surely if it's as powerful as
you think, it could feed a free SCM too for your non-bk friends in the
community.

The situation could be improved for these other tools if there wasn't so
much BK zealotry from those that use it.

There's no technical reason for this limitation.

No.  It's just that the cost isn't being paid by you, so you don't care.
