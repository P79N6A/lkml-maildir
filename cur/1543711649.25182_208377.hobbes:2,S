So? Those architectures can just allocate "struct page" entries for that 
memory too. 
There is a point where we should not care about idiotic architectures any 
more. We should care about what happens in 99% of all architectures, and 
the rest get to work around their _own_ quirks. We do not make the VM 
uglier for some insane "it can happen" case.
