Errm... That looks a bit unsafe. What is there then to stop another
process from removing "pos" while you are scheduling?
It seems to me that you should really start afresh in that case.
The good news, though, is that because requests on the "commit" list do
not remain locked for long without being removed from the list, you
should rarely have to skip them. IOW restarting from the head of the
list is pretty much the same as starting from where you left off.
