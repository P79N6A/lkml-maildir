Ingo's gone over them pretty closely.  The current theory is that the CPU
scheduler change alters timing sufficiently for the bug to bite.
The machine passes memtest86.
Ingo's suspecting stack corruption.  Do you know whether USB anywhere does
DMA into automatically-allocated storage (ie: kernel stacks)?
Am about to reboot into a stack-corruption-detector patch from Ingo.
