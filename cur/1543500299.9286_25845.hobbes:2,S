Of course, when we have a generic implementation we all agree on, this
should be a simple step.

Thanks to all which have also responed, i think i've found one version
of the patch:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9712.1/0098.html
Is this the last version of the patch?

Yes, i saw it in the patch.

Good pointer! The patch i found can be enhanced to do it likewise.

May also be possible, we just should use better stubs like in char/tty_io.c

I also think so, i'm interested what Al Viro is saying about the f_op.
One thing I miss in the patch i found is what Chris pointed out:

Question one: Is this the last version of the revoke patch?
Question two: Al Viro, what are you saying?
