The four extra calls would improve that flow like so...
enable_setpresuid
setuid
pre-fork child processes
\ setuid
  exec
accept request
choose free child
setpresuid(child, website user)
pass request to child
The children are pre-forked, so the overhead is in the setup... then
when the app recieves a request, it sets the child's uid to the uid of
the website, and then passes the request to the child, which, now, the
child is running as the website owner.
I know there are still loopholes in this methodology, like using the sig
handlers, but it is more secure then just doing nothing, there is no
fastCGI way to run each process as seperate users without the fork
overhead, which means every website can access every other websites data
without having to find any loop holes or write any special code.
It is more secure then just doing nothing.
