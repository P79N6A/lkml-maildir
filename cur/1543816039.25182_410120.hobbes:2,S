A valid concern.  I am of the opinion that we should try to
introduce change in small increments, whereever possible.

Being involved in RHEL support occasionally:  YES!
Page replacement may be doing the right thing in 99% of the
cases, but the misbehaviour in "corner cases" can be very
significant.  I put "corner cases" in quotes because they
are not cornercases to the users - these loads tend to be
the main workload on some systems!
IMHO, improving performance for most workloads is nowhere 
near as important as increasing the coverage of the VM,
ie. the number of workloads that it handles well.
