The main downside is the problem, that an object then can have multiple
different permissions and there is no easy way to ensure a basic level:
a- the kernel can't drop priveledges on a modified object easyly (this would
require your attribution to contain a version or checksumed reference)
b- the user can't drop/restrict a object once he knows that it's data is now
more sensitive (he has to worry about all old hard and softlinks to the
file)
c- how do you handle renames or moves of the data instances? move the
associated permissions of the moved entry and let all others point to nil
like breakign symlinks?
