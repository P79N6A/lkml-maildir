It would probably be helpful to annotate those types with the __u32 and
so on forms, to make it clear that userspace will be using them.

How does it work?  Is the value of PFM_PMD_BV different depending on
whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit arch?  That makes me pretty
uncomfortable.
Also, you should drop the typedef of pfarg_pmd_t and use "struct
pfarg_pmd" instead.  Likewise for all structs that are not intended to
be opaque.

Please see my prior message.

Ugh.

I don't see the difficulty.  Sure, you end up having to look at each
relayfs buffer in userspace instead of a single one, but can't libpfm
hide that from its consumers?  Surely having a finer granularity of data
like this ("I spent 75% of my time on this CPU") ends up being more
useful, no?
