Probably yes, but it also provides a first level of security :
  - if the intruder launches programs blindly, he will not systematically
    get write access. Eg: if he abuses a CGI to call things like
      echo r00t::0:0::/:/bin/sh >>/etc/passwd
    it will not work.
  - if you give root access to other people on your file-system but you
    don't give them the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability, they will not be
    able to modify the protected files. Useful when those files are the
    ones you use to grant them access ;-)
