At the risk of crashing my server, I've written something like this for
my hippy friends who don't have hard drive space.
http://datamorphism.com/linux.cgi
It's very elementary, targetted at extremely savvy people (who are
probably above web interface, go figure :), but it basically allows
one to build a custom kernel archive sans unwanted cpu archs/drivers.
The way it does this is very trivial (exclude directories from
arch or drivers while tarring), but some people have nice results.
The only snags are that the build depends on some driver directories existing
even if you're not using the code in them.
What should probably happen is I wait for CML2, write a web interface to it,
and then build an archive based on whatever users configure.
Anyone want to help out on this? I have some kind of archive caching so
there's only a finite number of possible archives that can be generated,
but my biggest fear is that my machine isn't man enough to handle the
load.
