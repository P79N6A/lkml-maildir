The included userspace server is largely proof-of-concept code and
could do with a fair amount of rounding out. Things this could use to
make it interesting:
 - authentication
 - run-time configuration
 - ability to serve from files and block devices (MD, LVM, crypto-loop)
 - ability to serve from /dev/sgX interfaces with native SCSI (tapes, CDRW..)
Don't know what the state of interop with other initiators is though.
I'll also point out that for many Linux<->Linux purposes, nbd is a workable
substitute.
