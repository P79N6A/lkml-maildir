I think I see what is happening.  The list gets a message that you are 
copied on.  It sees you have opted not to receive duplicates, it strips 
you from the cc list, since it knows that you will receive another copy 
by direct routing (outside the list).
What it should do, is keep you on the cc list but remove you from the 
smtp recipient list... that would both remove duplicates and keep you 
copied on messages.
So I recommend disabling 'Filter duplicate messages' in your list 
preferences and living with the duplicates.  I'll change the defaults 
for new subscriptions.
