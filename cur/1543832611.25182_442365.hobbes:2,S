But smp_call_function_single() generates an error if you try to call
it on your own CPU, so that doesn't make sense.
I fixed it like this, because that register defaults to zero
anyway and doesn't need initialization on CPU 0.
What I can't figure out is how this ever gets called on CPU 0
during init, whether it's SMP or not.
