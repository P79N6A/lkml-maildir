Subject: CDROM not ready messages from kernel - necessary?

Hi there.  This is a pet peeve that has been bothering me for years.
This is the chance to "scratch my own personal itch".
Is it necessary to have the kernel print the following message to
the console and syslog every few seconds:
...
Apr 26 21:36:03 home kernel: sr1: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in
 the drive.
Apr 26 21:36:34 home last message repeated 60 times
Apr 26 21:37:35 home last message repeated 119 times
Apr 26 21:37:44 home last message repeated 19 times
...
This makes the console more or less unusable.
Sometimes I want to leave my cd drive empty without closing my cd app.
Maybe we can have it print a few right away and then back off over
time.  I'll volunteer to hack this in, if there's a chance that it
will make it into the "real" kernel.
Thanks,
Mark
