Agreed.

(I'm the linux.* gateway operator.)
I'm not sure if there is a consensus about binaries in linux.* groups
which do not match *.binar*. OTOH last year I added linux.* to the
default cleanfeed configuration linux.* in the list of groups where
binaries are permitted and nobody ever complained.
If you want to be sure that the hierarchy is not hijacked by warez
kiddies you can just cancel everything not posted from /\.bofh\.it$/.
The real problem with linux.* is that when I started maintaining it I
only had the time to write the mail->news part, and never finished the
mail->news side, which has to be authenticated to avoid spam.
The plan is to have moderated groups where all articles are either
directly gated from the mailing list or first checked by my
robomoderation software, but I don't know when I'll find the time to
implement this.
