Okay, endtime is always absolute value of when it should have expired. 
But I think I see a problem with the opaque cookie scheme and repeating 
timeouts.
Suppose I want to wake my application at INTERVAL nanoseconds from now 
on the MONOTONIC clock, then again every INTERVAL nanoseconds after that.
How do I do that with this API?
I can get the first sleep.  Suppose I oversleep by X nanoseconds.  I 
wake, and get an opaque timeout back.  How do I ask for the new wake 
time to be "endtime + INTERVAL"?
