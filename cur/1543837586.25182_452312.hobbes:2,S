We got the system working, well, two of the three are working now.
Yesterday I tarred over /lib/modules/2.6.16.16 and /boot/*2.6.16.16*.  This
morning I did a sum on the *2.6.16.16* files in /boot and they did not match
the originals (!?! go figure !?!) so I copied them over so they match and
the machine came right up.
Now we'll see if I can duplicate this on machine #3.
THANKS FOR ALL THE HELP!
:b!
