heh, I guess that's a manner of opinion :)
To me, your patch makes things less readable.  Example:
> -	int is_barrier = blk_fs_request(rq) && blk_barrier_rq(rq);
> +	int is_barrier = blk_fs_request(rq) && rq->flags & REQ_HARDBARRIER;
After your change is applied, the above statement is no longer visually 
consistent with itself.  The reader must decode two different styles of 
test in his brain, as opposed to one.
