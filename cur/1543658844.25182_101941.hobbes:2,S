Subject: [2.4.20] e1000 as module gives unresolved symbol _mmx_memcpy

Hi,
While trying to use the e1000 as a module with kernel 2.4.20 it gives
me a unresolved symbol while trying to insmod the module. The offending
symbol is _mmx_memcpy. When the driver is compiled into the kernel
there's no problem.
I am running the kernel on a VIA Eden with 800MHz C3. Does this have
something to do with the fact that kernels for the VIA C3 are now
compiled with i486 optimisations (so maybe no MMX support?)?
Cheers,
Jurgen
