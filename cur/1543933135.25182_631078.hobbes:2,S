ah-hah.  git-agpgart.patch

It does, thanks.
Dave, a `cat /proc/iomem' crashes after a suspend/resume cycle when it
reaches the intel_private.ifp_resource record.
intel_i915_configure() is called on each resume and it calls
intel_i9xx_setup_flush() which zeroes out the already-registered `struct
resource', causing core kernel to oops over a deref of
parent/sibling/child.
Probably this:
--- a/drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c~a
+++ a/drivers/char/agp/intel-agp.c
@@ -883,8 +883,6 @@ static void intel_i965_g33_setup_chipset
 static void intel_i9xx_setup_flush(void)
 {
 	/* setup a resource for this object */
-	memset(&intel_private.ifp_resource, 0, sizeof(intel_private.ifp_resource));
-
 	intel_private.ifp_resource.name = "Intel Flush Page";
 	intel_private.ifp_resource.flags = IORESOURCE_MEM;
 
_
will be enough to prevent the crash, but I suspect a bit more than that
will be needed.
