I use the same version of the driver with my Geforce3 and I am also 
running 2.4.13-pre6 and it works just fine so I don't agree with you 
that it breaks...
You do know that there are a few files that need to be recompiled every 
time you build a new kernel - right?
See "
http://www.nvidia.com/docs/lo/1021/SUPP/README.txt"
 for details.
Here's a quote from that file explaining what I do myself - that should 
work for you:
"
INSTALLING/UPGRADING BY TAR FILE Instructions for the Impatient:
       $ tar xvzf NVIDIA_kernel.tar.gz
       $ tar xvzf NVIDIA_GLX.tar.gz
       $ cd NVIDIA_kernel
       $ make install
       $ cd ../NVIDIA_GLX
       $ make install
Instructions:
To install from tar file, unpack each file:
       $ tar xvzf NVIDIA_kernel.tar.gz
       $ tar xvzf NVIDIA_GLX.tar.gz
cd into the NVIDIA_kernel directory.  Type 'make install'.  This will
compile the kernel interface to the NVdriver, link the NVdriver, copy
the NVdriver into place, and attempt to insert the NVdriver into the
running kernel:
       $ cd NVIDIA_kernel
       $ make install
Next, move into the NVIDIA_GLX directory.  Type 'make install' -- this
will copy the needed OpenGL and XFree86 files into place:
       $ cd ../NVIDIA_GLX
       $ make install
Note that the "make install" for each package will remove any previously
installed NVIDIA drivers.
