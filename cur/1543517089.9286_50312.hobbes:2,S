Making these changes now is also a bad idea IMHO because Eric Youngdale just
submitted his redo of bits of the block device layer and the scsi queueing.
That seperates out the block device queueing by major nicely and really wants
to be done before the kdev_t work which will I think come out rather nicely
with it
