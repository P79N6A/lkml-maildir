Sounds like a good plan since this probably is a nice way to make stupid apps
doing stupid things sit up and take notice, and maybe the authors will then go
so far as fixing up a few more things that are hurting them once they actually
recognize that something is weird due to overly bad performance.
Why go to great lengths to support stupid apps when there are still so many things
which could be done to help well-behaving ones? ;)
