graveman had the same problem.   I went and used cdrecord-prodvd and 
haven't had a problem with direct command line, gcombust, or xcdroast 
(those are all plain frontends to the userspace tools).   
This seems to be a userspace problem in operating with libata/pata.    
xcdroast/gcombust and regular commandline usage of cdrecord-prodvd work 
fine.
