I just had a (quite) hard hang with 2.4.3-XFS (cvs from oss.sgi.com).
The machine got totally unresponsive in X, and it barely managed to execute
any commands from the serial console. After issuing a reboot, and waiting
for quite some time, I flipped the powerswitch.
Frm the syslog it looks like it started with:
kernel: spurious APIC interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
then there's repeated messages like:
kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
kernel: ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_lostirq func only: 13
kernel: hdc: lost interrupt
This was on a K6-2, kernel config and hardware information available upon
request.
