Yes, it depends how much functionality you *need*, sffs implements
more file operations so that you can do things like:
	mkisofs -o /mnt/test/blah.iso  [...]
and	cdrecord -v -data /mnt/test/blah.iso (without needing isosize).
But what is odd, having run my benchmarks on rawfs, that sffs
is faster by between (0.5% and 4.6%) where I was expecting
almost identical results (but then, benchmarks aren't everything).
