Thanks, Andi.
No, because of (size_t) (it's typedef) from offsetof() and &.  But
	if ( (int) offsetof(struct task_struct, thread.i387.fxsave) % 16) {
would be optiminzed away. So I'll change the patch like that. 
Thanks,
Jun

	So it would be optimized away if changed to 
	if ((offsetof(struct task_struct, thread.i387.fxsave) & 15) != 0) {
	?

I think it would be better to keep the check, even with attribute aligned.
These bugs
are nasty to debug when they happen.
