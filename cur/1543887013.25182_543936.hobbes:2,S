i just *know* this is a mistake, but i'm going to take one more shot
at distinguishing between deprecated and obsolete.
as i understand it, the raw driver is *deprecated*.  that is, it's
still there, it's still supported, people are still using it but its
use is *seriously* discouraged and everyone should be trying to move
off of it at their earliest possible convenience.
that is *not* the same as "obsolete" which should mean that that
feature is dead, dead, DEAD and *no one* should be using it anymore.
yes, i realize it sounds like splitting hairs, but it's this malleable
definition of "deprecated" that's causing all of this trouble in the
first place -- the fact that the raw driver is currently listed as
"obsolete" when it is, in fact, only deprecated.
in short, do *not* remove its "deprecated" status.  rather, remove its
"obsolete" status and *make* it deprecated.
