But what if there is no parent, since the system has already disposed 
of it?
There was no parent visible to kpm.  Unforch kpm also doesn't 
specificaly mark zombies as such either, so its a bit clueless in 
that regard.  Finding them is usually an exersize in stretching the 
top window out till its about 20 screens high as its always going to 
be at the bottom of the list.
If init can indeed do the cleanup, then how hard is it to have a "kill 
--total procnumber" pass that info into init and let it do its thing?
Or better yet, when X asks me if I want it gone because its not 
responding to the close button, have X do it all in one swell foop.
