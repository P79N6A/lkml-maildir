Totally wrong. You're confusing the  Mach operating system (with UX, a
BSD-server on top of the  Mach micro-kernel) and the Mach micro-kernel
itself.

GNU Mach is  a modified version of OSF Mach  which is modified version
of CMU Mach.

Maybe  for  you,  an  OS  is  drivers.  For  me,  it's  a  design,  an
architecture, a  philosophy, and a way  to defend a value  that is not
important for you: Freedom.

Stop trolling, thank you.
