Hello,
since I use the ISDN subsystem as included in the kernel (2.1.132, 2.2.0pre1)
everyday I wonder what exactly is supposed to be broken in the ISDN subsystem?
The only problems I have are:
   - TCPv4 bad checksum messages from time to time
   - isdn-tools needed a small patch when switching from 2.1.132
     to 2.2.0pre1 because the tools scan the kernel version string (uname)
     to determine the kernel version and did not expect the 'pre1' part.
I use the AVM FritzCard (ISA) and synchronous ppp.
Regards
  Steffen
