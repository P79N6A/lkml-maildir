Hi,
I have a problem with kswapd and I didn't find anything in the
archives of the list (I hope not having missed someone).
kswapd is using 100% of CPU in a suse sles8 with kernel 2.4.241. This
machine has its FS under LVM and ResiserFS, except for /boot which is
in ext2.
Any idea? Thanks in advance.
