thomas added this to the linux driver, too, although i don't know if
it's already included in the recent alsa version ... he sent me a
patched source file some times ago ... anyway, it didn't help on my
machine...

i haven't had a look at this screenshot, yet, but can you tell me which
registers have been altered in windows?

you can use scanpci to get the actual register settings from your
devices ... i'd be pretty curious if your windows register settings
differ from your linux register settings ... i'll have a look at your
screenshots tomorrow ... i'd appreciate if you could send me an output
of scanpci of your linux settings that i can compare it with mine ... 
and if some people with hdsps that are actually working on their
machines would provide us with their register settings, we might be able
to figure out, where the problem could come from ...
cheers...
