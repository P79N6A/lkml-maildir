I don't think so. Unless you want to run something like screen all the
time, you can not do this.
What strings do you attach, and how do you manage to listen when user
types cat > /tmp/filename?
Yes, I want cat > /tmp/filename, then select something with mouse,
then paste it. AFAICS there's no easy way to intercept the string
before it gets to cat.
