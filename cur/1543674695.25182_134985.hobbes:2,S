I'm seeing the following with syncppp under 2.5.69:
1. When syncppp tries to send a control protocol packet,
I see the following kernel messages:
 Badness in local_bh_enable at kernel/softirq.c:105
 Call Trace:
  [<c01254b4>] local_bh_enable+0x84/0x90
  [<c02dbbc0>] dev_queue_xmit+0x1c0/0x250
  [<cc82fd18>] sppp_lcp_open+0x78/0x90 [syncppp]
  [<cc82fe3d>] sppp_cp_timeout+0xad/0xd0 [syncppp]
  [<cc82fd90>] sppp_cp_timeout+0x0/0xd0 [syncppp]
  [<c01295dd>] run_timer_softirq+0xcd/0x190
  [<c012542b>] do_softirq+0xdb/0xe0
  [<c011790d>] smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0xcd/0x140
  [<c0108f90>] default_idle+0x0/0x40
  [<c010bc82>] apic_timer_interrupt+0x1a/0x20
This appears the indicate that dev_queue_xmit() can't
be called with local interrupts disabled (which is the
case as a spinlock is held when this call is made).
It looks like a lot of reworking is necessary if this is true.
2. When network packets are received I see the following message:
  [<c0121e65>] fix old protocol handler sppp_rcv+0x0/0x1e [syncppp]!
Any docs covering what needs to be done for this one?
Thanks,
Paul
