The card is a video only capture that came with a camera (and has a
connector to power that camera next to the video connector).  Hauppauge is
silkscreened on the PCB, along with Axiom Design.  I didn't buy it, so all
I have to go off of is what's on the card.  So here's all of it.
Sticker on back: 58051 REV A 231383
On Bt chip: Bt848kpf video decoder 255 9637
As far as the bttv driver version, I've always used the ones that came
originally with that kernel version.
This is what lspci says:
00:0f.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt848 (rev 11)
        Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort-
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 16 min, 40 max, 64 set
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 9
        Region 0: Memory at eddfe000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
A cat of /proc/pci reports REV 17 instead of 11.

Adrian
