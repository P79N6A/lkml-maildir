   I don't really know to which version you are referring to. If you
   wrote about OpenBSD then I can't give an authoritative answer.

   Yes, that is a very nature of atheros radio chips. It is simplier to
   tell what you can't do in software with these chipsets. This
   complicates writing a driver a bit too ;-)

  Hummm... these are old patches :) the new site is located at
        
http://www.ath-driver.org
 
 
  As I'm going to put separate patch snapshots out there too, I will
  change the naming order.
