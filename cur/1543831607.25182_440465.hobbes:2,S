Yes, they would interfere. That's why I'm not proposing to add them to
ext4 in the first place.

Yes, this is a problem. Although you would of course have a tool for
purging the files unconditionally, some programs may need the assumption
that an unlinked file is gone forever.
Regarding the second clause, well, Linux is not Unix-like in many
respects and we want it like that. That's a weak argument.

See 2. Explicit purging is of course possible. (Novell Netware also had
a "purge" command.)
Anyway, it seems that there is some functionality which many users want
but which can't be provided in user space: 
  - if files are moved to the recycle-bin-or-whatever-you-call-it, their
size is added to disk free space and
  - automatically purging least recently deleted files.
