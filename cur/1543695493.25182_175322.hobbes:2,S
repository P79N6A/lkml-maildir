Any chance to know where the machine dies?  Any oops you can help us out

If you do not load the HID driver, and disable automatic loading of the
hid driver (echo '/sbin/true' > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug) and plug in
the device, does it still crash?
If not, can you get us the output of /proc/bus/usb/devices and lsusb
with the device plugged in?
If not, does then loading the hid driver cause the problem?
