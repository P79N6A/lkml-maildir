	There are a number of generally more useful (to the 'evil' one) things that
can be done.  In any case, perhaps coming up w/ a patch to allow for a 64bit PID,
and fixing up everything to use it, while not introducing any new security holes,
and fixing every program in existance that uses a pid will do what you want, but
I don't see much of a payoff for that much work.

	If _pavel_ is evil, and got lucky enough to manage this, chances are
_pavel_ won't be around on that box much longer.
