I'm not on a crusade to clean up drivers/ide, in fact I could not care
less it if rots away (thank fully it is doing just that, pata is going
away). Most of your complaints are not valid in my opinion (->wrq usage
is fine. it's not pretty, but it's not broken as long as you serialize
access across the hwgroup of course). Like the rest, it's an artifact of
how messy the code paths are in there. That could be cleaned too
naturally, but that's someone elses job and I'm not about to increase my
work load in that area.
That you need to queue pre/post flushes to support barriers is a _driver
implementation detail_ in my opinion. You don't want to even advertise
that to upper layers. I will move a little of that into the block layer,
if only because SATA will need it as well.
As for REQ_DRIVE_TASK and ide_get_error_location(), well hell I do take
patches! If there's something you consider broken, damnit send a patch
to correct it and I'll surely merge it into the base if I agree it makes
sense. That's the way to get changes done if you feel something should
be different, snide remarks with basically zero detail is not.
