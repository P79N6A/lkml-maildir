Probably a useful check is to find out if the "bad Van J compression"
problem is bad in the same way each time. If so, then it could be an
idea to include some sort of workaround for it in the PPP routines,
similar to the way we've worked round the F00F bug rather than insist
that users upgrade...
Best wishes from Riley.
