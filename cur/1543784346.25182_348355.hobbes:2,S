There are changes to both sata_nv and to md in 2.6.13-mm2.  To isolate them
it would be great of you could apply 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.13/2.6.13-mm2/broken-out/linus.patch
to 2.6.13 and see if the problem still happens.  That will separate out the
md changes which are still in -mm.
Thanks.
