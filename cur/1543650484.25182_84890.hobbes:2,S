oops, yes, thanks.

do you mean that the interrupts are generated too slowly?
you can measure how many UART interrupts are generated per second by
checking /proc/interrupts.
if it's too little, the problem is likely in the hardware
initialization part, which i simply copied from your patch.
but it could be a wrong copy & paste.
please check pc98_mpu401_init() in pc98.c.
btw, which MPU mode are you using, PC98II or normal MPU401?
