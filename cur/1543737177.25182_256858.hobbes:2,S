That is a bug in the md driver then.

So the number has changed.  Means it is aligning the two pieces
differently.  But still not correctly.  Actually, having looked at the
dump of your LDM database again, it is not rounding anything at all. It
behaves exactly like the NT4 fault tolerant arrays, i.e. it uses all
512-byte sectors to store data.
You can see it from:
Volume2 Size: 0x05AB2EA2 (46437 MB)
    Volume2-01
      Disk2-01   VolumeOffset: 0x00000000 Offset: 0x00000000 Length:
0x033A186B
      Disk2-02   VolumeOffset: 0x033A186B Offset: 0x033A18AA Length:
0x02711637
Disk2-01 contains 0x033a186B sectors == 5413987 in decimal an you can
see the number is odd and hence the Linux md driver cannot work as it
uses 1024 bytes minimum so it can never work.  )-:
Disk2-02 starts at the offset Disk2-01 stops and hence the Linux md
driver again cannot work.
Sorry but with current Linux md driver and tools it is not possible to
make your linear arrays work.

It doesn't.
