Subject: [PATCH 0/4] UML - Four for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/5/285

These four are also 2.6.22 material.  They are -
	giving some drivers release methods so they can be
hot-unplugged without either the kernel or hch complaining
	delete a now-unused macro
	improved debugging output
	faster page table walking
