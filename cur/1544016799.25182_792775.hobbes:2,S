RAM caches are different from flash caches: they're volatile.
Essentially they're the cause of our barrier flush issues.  The point
about flash caches is they're non volatile.  You can pull power from the
disk as soon as the data is in flash cache; the disc can commit it again
as soon as it powers up.

Um these really have to be things we can get out of the device at boot
time without effort (as in part of the data the device can give in a
single command).  I'll be shot for increasing boot time so we can work
out these parameters ...

CONFIG_SLOW_YOUR_BOOT?
