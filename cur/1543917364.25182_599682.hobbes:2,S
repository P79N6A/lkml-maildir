Subject: [PATCH] clockevents: fix bogus next_event reset for oneshot broadcast devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/27/295

In periodic broadcast mode the next_event member of the broadcast device
structure is set to KTIME_MAX in the interrupt handler. This is wrong,
as we calculate the next periodic interrupt with this variable.
Remove it.
Noticed by Ralf. MIPS is the first user of this mode, it does not affect
existing users.
