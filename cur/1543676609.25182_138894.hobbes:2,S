hmm, yes, well.  There's a certain amount of sloppiness allowed with
it being a macro, in that bus->sysdata and dev->sysdata have the same
value so it works both ways.  Of course, this prohibits any architecture
from implementing it as a function, so we really should make up our minds
which it is to be.  It sounds like bus is more generally useful than dev,
so I'll make that explicit.
