I mentioned a while ago I was hacking on libata and PATA drivers. I've
also fed a few bits of the needed support code to Jeff Garzik as I went.
Some initial patches are now ready for wider testing although strictly
suicide squad material at this point. I'm now at the point I'm running a
full Fedora Core 4 with CONFIG_IDE=n using four disk raid on SIL680
controllers.
A lot of hardware isn't yet covered - I'm working on adding more support
but I wanted to start with weirder devices first to better understand
what was needed in libata.
Status info and patches are at

Enjoy but remember this is very early code and don't use it for
production!
