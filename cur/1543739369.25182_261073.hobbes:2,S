It appears they are using their Rapid Array ASICs/network for the time
synchronization.  I wonder if it would be possible to implement this
solution on standard cluster hardware that doesn't have this custom network
with its inherent fine grained clock.  NTP wouldn't be able to give
microsecond level time synchronization would it, considering its daemon
status...
This would definitely be a feather in the cap for someone who could code
this to work with SHV (standard high volume) hardware.
