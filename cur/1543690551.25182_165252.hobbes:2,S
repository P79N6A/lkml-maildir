This changes the mask to 00000003. Much more reasonable.

I didn't have irqbalanced running. After some investigation, setting
the mask to 00000002 gets interrupts to hit cpu 1. Setting it to
00000001 or 00000003 gets all interrupts to hit cpu 0. Setting
noirqbalance doesn't do anything to change this.
