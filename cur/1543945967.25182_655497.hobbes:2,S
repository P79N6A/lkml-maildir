Please feel free to repeat my little experiment: give someone who sends
you a lot of checkpatch.pl only patches a simple task that actually
requires a little actual code change and at least a little localized 
understanding of code. See how well they do.
In my case it was the "turn ->ioctl into ->unlocked_ioctl" task,
which was simple enough.
I found that there were a lot of useful unlocked_ioctl patches
in the end, but they all only came from people who hadn't submitted
any checkpatch.pl only patches before.
