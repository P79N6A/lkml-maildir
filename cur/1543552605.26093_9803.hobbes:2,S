This should already be done IIRC. At least nfsd_open() always sets
O_LARGEFILE.

The exact same code from ext2_open_file() should work fine in
nfs_open().
BTW: There seems to be a bug there: according to the LFS docs, on
http://ewe3.sas.com/standards/large.file/x_open.20Mar96.html
we should be returning EOVERFLOW rather than EBIG.
