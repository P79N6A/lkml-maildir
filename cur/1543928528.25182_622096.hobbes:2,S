try with a lower MAX_TRACE first - 1 million entries (default) uses up 
like 32 MB of RAM per CPU, that might be quite a bit and your UML image 
might not be able to take that.
also, you can do a s/trace_alloc_bootmem/alloc_bootmem - the 
alloc-bootmem wrapping was only done to get the tracer boot with really 
ridiculously high MAX_TRACE.
