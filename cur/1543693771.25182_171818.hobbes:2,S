	No, the high-end for hardware is getting smaller.  The need for
high-end jobs is just fine.  But as you point out, the high-end jobs are
being done by low-end hardware.  And here is Oracle, promoting a bank of
cheap-ass 2-way boxen to do the job.

	Again, we need this sort of stuff precisely because we'd rather
use 2 $5k Linux/Intel servers than 1 $40k Sun server (and the Linux box
outruns the Sun, quite comfortably).  That's the "powerful enough",
right there.

	Linus, I've said it twice above.  This has been our entire
direction for the past couple years, and we've been loud about it.
Please, knock us for what we do wrong, but recognize what we are
actually doing wrong, not what you think we are doing.

	Well, if a cracker and virus writer can get enough priviledge to
write(), cached or O_DIRECT, they can corrupt you without worrying about
this specific gotcha.  That doesn't mean you don't fix it, but it also
doesn't mean you throw up your hands and claim you can't do it.

	I know that, I agree with it, and I said as much a few emails
past.  Linux should refuse to corrupt your data.  But you've taken the
tack "It is unsafe today, so we should abandon it altogether, never mind
fixing it.", which doesn't logically follow.
