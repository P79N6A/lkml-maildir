heheh.  i can't claim that i was the first ever to think of this.  but
here's the post i originally made on the topic.  iirc a few folks said
"security horror!"... then last year ingo and linus (and probably others)
came up with a scheme everyone was happy with.
i was kind of solving a different problem with the code page though -- the
ability to use rdtsc on SMP boxes with processors of varying speeds and
synchronizations.

apache w/NSPR threading is doing gettimeofday() left and right too (it's
used after poll() to figure out how much time elapsed)... so much that
I was talking to Ingo about ways to make it faster... and came up with
a user-space method of using RDTSC which can handle changes to the
system clock.  In a nutshell it requires a /dev/calibrate (or whatever
you want to call it) which is mmappable -- you need the "epoch" value (the
time that cycle 0 occured at), and the "cycles per microsecond" value.
I suppose that isn't too revolutionary... what had me stumped for a
while though, was how to do this on SMP boxes, I was assuming their
TSCs weren't synchronized (Ingo tells me they are on Intel).  In case it
happens elsewhere, here's my idea.  Use a separate v->p mapping for the
/dev/calibrate page on each processor.  It's marked read-only of course.
In order to handle atomicity (can't take a task switch while in the
middle of using the "epoch" and "cycles per microsecond" constants), put
the code which actually calculates the time of day on the /dev/calibrate
page itself.  The kernel notices EIP on this page when it's switching
away from a task, and completes the call in the kernel prior to switching.
(It only needs to futz the stack a bit -- unroll a stack frame and set
edx:eax... it can do it right in the saved registers.)
Note that this trick provides for more "user space system calls"... I
imagine a bunch of the signal routines such as sigprocmask and sigaction
could actually be done through routines on a special read-only page.
The kernel deals with atomicity only when it needs to.
