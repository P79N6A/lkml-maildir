It does seem to be a losing battle, but I'm wondering whether that's really 
because it's an intractable problem, or because people have given up on it 
before its time. We are talking about a computer system, so things should be 
predictable.

I guess I want to persist because all of these issues aren't utterly 
unsolvable. It's just that we don't have the infrastructure yet to figure out 
the solutions to these issues trivially. Take, for example, the locking 
issue. If we could call some function to say "What process holds this lock?", 
then task A could know that it's waiting on task B and put that information 
somewhere. We could then use the information to freeze task B before task A.

That's what I'm questioning. Is there a more reliable way and we've just given 
up too quickly?

Nigel
