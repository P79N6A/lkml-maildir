while i tentatively agree with the introduction of clocksource driver 
notifications in general (given any actual real users of that 
infrastructure), i can see three problems with your notifier changes:
firstly, with the full changes applied, CLOCKSOURCE_NOTIFY_RATING is 
totally unused (and not even driven by the core clocksource code).
secondly, CLOCKSOURCE_NOTIFY_REGISTER is only used by the core 
clocksource code and no register-notifier interface is exposed: this 
makes the whole thing an expensive NOP.
thirdly, CLOCKSOURCE_NOTIFY_FREQ is totally unused as well.
(there are tons of examples in the kernel of how to do driver 
notification APIs properly.)
