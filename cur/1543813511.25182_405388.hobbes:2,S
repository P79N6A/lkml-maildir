Yes, you did.

I will look at the document, just got hold of it.

I see your point now. I am looking at other users of netlink like
rtnetlink and I see the classical usage.
We can implement TLV's in our code, but for the most part the data we exchange
between the user <-> kernel has all the TLV's listed in the enum above.
The major differnece is the type (pid/tgid). Hence we created a structure
(taskstats) instead of using TLV's.

Your understanding is correct.

Yes, this is correct as well.

True, we do not need a header.

Hmm.. Will look into this.

Yes, it does immensely. Thanks for the detailed feedback.
