This thing looks pretty overengineered. It is difficult to
read with all the little wrapper functions and weird naming
schemes.
What would be wrong with an array of NR_CPUS rwsems? The only
tiny trick you would have to do AFAIKS is have up_read remember
what rwsem down_read took, but that could be returned from
down_read as a token.
I have been meaning to do something like this for mmap_sem to
see what happens to page fault scalability (though the heavy
write-side would make such a scheme unsuitable for mainline).
