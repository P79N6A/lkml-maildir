If there is a static maximum of scbs for megaraid hardware, dynamically 
allocating scbs in ->queuecommand is a waste of time.
In my drivers, I pre-allocate driver-specific per-request structures -- 
just like the SCSI layer does ;-)
If you follow this -- faster -- approach, make sure you don't waste a 
lot of memory with pre-allocated scb's you'll rarely use.

Would prefer to identify the root cause of pci_pool_xxx failure, since 
that is the proper API to use.
