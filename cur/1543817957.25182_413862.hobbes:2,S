         Hi all,
         I am trying to run WRF model (
http://wrf-model.org
) on a dual core 
dual cpu opteron system with intel c/fortran 9 , scientific linux (rhel compatible,
tried 3.0.4 ,3.0.5 , 4.2) and mpich 1.2.7p1. As long as I use the vendor supplied
kernels everything works fine.However , when I use kernels compiled on my own, I am
getting erratic behaviour: the model will either crash, or produce invalid results,
or complete successfully approximately once in 20 attemps. If I run it on one CPU
it completes successfully with all kernels.
         I have tried with 2.6.14.3, 2.6.15.6 and 2.6.9. Both show the same 
erratic behaviour. Kernels 2.6.9-22 and 2.6.9-34 as supplied by scientific 
linux 4.2 and 2.4.21-37.0.1 in 3.0.4 work fine. All kernels are smp enabled.
I am copying the .config of the vendor kernels, compiling mpt fusion scsi 
drivers in kernel and not as modules in some cases. The application runs 
exclusively on the opteron system.
 	I have no idea how to deal with this situation. Any help is 
appreciated.
 	Best regards,
--
