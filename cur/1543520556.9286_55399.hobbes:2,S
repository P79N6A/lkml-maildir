Sorry if you have seen this before -- I haven't seen it from linux-kernel,
so I assume it went into a black hole somewhere.
The attached patch makes some mostly cosmetic corrections to the recent
ramdisk patch.  This is against pre-2.3.35-4, although it should be the
same against pre-2.3.35-6.
1. Clean up the commentary somewhat.
2. Remove two non-zero values from memset() calls that were there for
   debugging.
3. In the case of no buffers available, return a failure reply to the
   caller, rather than performing a BUG() call.  This doesn't change
   anything as far as out-of-memory conditions are concerned; only the
   reporting.
