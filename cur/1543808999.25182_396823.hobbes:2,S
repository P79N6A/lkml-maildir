Joerg, I think you've got your OS's mixed up here. AFAIK, Linux does not have 
a "vold" system.

I have to agree that you are correct, but then, most removable media in the 
Linux world do not actually have physical inodes. AFAIK, DVD's use the UDF 
filesystem, a lot of CDRW's are formatted the same, CD's/CDR's generally use 
the ISO9660 filesystem and other removable media, such as any floppy disc and 
the now ubiquitous "zip disk's" use FAT16. I'm not current on UDF, but from 
prior experience, I'd be willing to bet it doesn't have indoes, and the 
ISO9660 filesystem doesn't have them, even if you use the RR extensions. What 
is referred to in the Linux kernel as inodes for those systems are generally 
block indexes, and for the FAT filesystem what it calls an "inode" is just 
the name and a few other bits - and in the case of an LFN being used on said 
volume, the name is spread across several "special blocks"... invalidating 
the concept of an INODE for said filesystems.
In any case, the hypothetical case you present here seems more in tune with 
Solaris as you present it, since with UDEV the device node created for said 
removable media would stay the same, and hence st_dev would also (IIRC) 
remain the same.
