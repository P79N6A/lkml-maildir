Yikes.  Undetected.
Wait, what?  Disks, at least, would be protected by RAID.  Are you 
telling me RAID won't detect such an error?
It just seems wholly alien to me that errors would go undetected, and 
we're OK with that, so long as our filesystems are robust enough.  If 
it's an _undetected_ error, doesn't that cause way more problems 
(impossible problems) than FS corruption?  Ok, your FS is fine -- but 
now your bank database shows $1k less on random accounts -- is that ok?

Sounds good, but I've never let discussions by people smarter than me 
prevent me from asking the stupid questions.

Seems it would need to hit every application also...
