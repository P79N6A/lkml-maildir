I guess this is connected to another message from you,

So, if we have global A == B == 0,
	CPU_0		CPU_1
	A = 1;		B = 2;
	mb();		mb();
	b = B;		a = A;
It could happen that a == b == 0, yes? Isn't this contradicts with definition
of mb?
By definition, when CPU_0 issues 'b = B', 'A = 1' should be visible to other
CPUs, yes? Now, b == 0 means that CPU_1 did not read 'a = A' yet, otherwise
'B = 2' should be visible to all CPUs (by definition again).
Could you please clarify this?
Btw, this is funny, but I was going to suggest _exactly_ same cleanup for
srcu_read_lock :)
Oleg.
