What about arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:assign_irq_vector() ?
It starts on FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR(==0x31) and walks through each
eight vector up to FIRST_SYSTEM_VECTOR(==0xEF) (skipping SYSCALL_VECTOR 
(0x80)). Then restarting at FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR+1... until panic
'ran out of interrupt sources!' occurs.
So you should (1) preffer irqs which are multiple of 8 (*), as they are
allocated as last and (2) you should add check for your irq number
into assign_irq_vector.
                                        Best regards,

(*) If my memory serves correctly SGI has allocated 0x88 or 0x90 in
one of their patches...
