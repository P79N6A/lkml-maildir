Hi Rik,
There was an AdvanSys PCI SCSI board detection bug introduced in
v2.3.17, which was fixed in v2.3.18. As it turns out the 3.2G driver
did not work in >= v2.3.13. Based on your subject line maybe you were
using the 3.2G driver in >= v2.3.13.
If you haven't already please try using the 3.2H driver which is in
v2.3.18, otherwise please send me more details.

BTW Yes, the driver "ioport=" option is only used by the driver for
ISA and VL card detection. It has no effect on EISA and PCI card
detection.
