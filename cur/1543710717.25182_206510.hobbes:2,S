Hi,
Why is there no include/linux/version.h after having compiled -mm1 and -mm2 ?
Compilation of kernel is fine, but because of this, my nvidia modules won't
compile.
As said in the subject, 2.6.4 vanilla is ok, version.h is here after
compilation.
I use debian woody, and I type
make-kpkg --append-to-version -ff --revision 1 binary-arch
make-kpkg --append-to-version -ff --revision 1 modules_image
to build kernel_image, kernel_headers and nvidia-kernel.
Did I misunderstand something ?
Thank you for any help.
