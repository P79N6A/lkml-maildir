shared libs aren't read only! they have all the relocations applied for
example. (the fact that glibc mprotects it read only again afterwards
doesn't change things.. part of the memory is already written to). and
mprotect can be called again.... what would mprotect need to do if it's
asked to make memory writable and the overcommit says "no space" ....
