I have a requirement to pass information from the kernel to user space. 
The information is passed fairly rarely, but over time extra parameters 
are added. At the moment we just use a struct, but that means that the 
kernel and the userspace app have to both keep in step. If something 
like XML was used, we could implement new parameters in the kernel, and 
the user space could just ignore them, until the user space is upgraded.
XML would initially seem a good idea for this, but are there any methods 
currently used in the kernel that could handle these parameter changes 
over time.
For example, should the sysfs be used for this?
Any comments?
