Yo,
I took over upstream maintainership of the module-init-tools package 
from Rusty at the end of last year. At this point, there's a public 
wiki, new pre-release, bugzilla and all that jazz up and running:
http://www.kerneltools.org/
 has links to the latest release.
There's a mailing list, etc. and most of us involved in m-i-t 
development seem to have already noticed, but just in case, I'm sending 
this reminder out to LKML now. I don't plan on shouting about every 
minor release from this point on - unless it's critically serious.
If you've got any patches (preferably git trees), let me know.
Jon.
