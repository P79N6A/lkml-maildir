Greetings;
About a week ago I did and rm -fR on the hotplug stuffs because it was 
totally hanging the boot for some reason.
Tonight I re-installed it and did a test reboot to 2.6.2-rc3.  When it 
got to "Starting hotplug", the init script sat there for around 30 
seconds, and eventually said OK.  It did load the one module I have 
set as a module, for the pl-2303 seriel to usb adaptor.  Or at least 
I didn't have to do it by hand with modprobe.
Is this huge, even worse than kudzu, boot delay normal for hotplug?
