This will then break other boards. As far as I can tell there is no
"correct" answer here for 5530 based hardware. The existing setup makes
most random CS5520/30 based PC systems like the Palmax laptops work if the
irq router is used, your change will break them
Given the choice between LinuxBIOS and the rest of the world then the
rest of the world needs to win. The 5530 is absent from the IRQ routing
table because it varied by system what the right answer was.
