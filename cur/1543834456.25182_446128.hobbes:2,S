Subject: [PATCH] Add linux-mm mailing list for memory management in MAINTAINERS file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/24/82

Since I didn't know about the linux-mm mailing list until I spammed all
those that had their names anywhere in the mm directory, I'm sending
this patch to add the linux-mm mailing list to the MAINTAINERS file.
Also, since mm is so broad, it doesn't have a single person to maintain
it, and thus no maintainer is listed.  I also left the status as
Maintained, since it obviously is.
