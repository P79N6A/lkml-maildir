Hello
Is it possible to use some Linux I2C driver to program an I2C EEPROM,
for example 24C16?
I have noticed only read-only access to "DIMM eeproms". Are they
24C16-alike?
Is there some reason why write driver is not present like users could
inadvertently overwrite their DIMM eeproms? Do these eeproms have a
protection against write?
I am mainly interested in an application where 24C16 is in-circuit
connected to a PC and contents read and wrote (typically poking
at firmware configuration of various devices).
