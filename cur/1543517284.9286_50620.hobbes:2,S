I think stuff like that should be outside the kernel.
Some kind of PCI detection script with a HUGE database.
People came to some conclusion in the 'Hot PCI bus plugging" thread.
I think non-swappable PCI devices should be treated as a subset of the 
swappable ones.
To add new hardware ID:s to the driver and recompile would
sure work for you. And for me. I would do the same thing.
But in the long run I think we must have some central database.
But how will compiled-in drivers work if you need a userspace database?
Maybe could people run some hardware detection script which generates 
some header files for the kernel... Or? 
Am I way off?
