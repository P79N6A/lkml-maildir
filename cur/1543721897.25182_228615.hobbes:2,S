Fine: at least the FIXME clearly says that it must be fixed :o)
NV_MIIBUSY_DELAY is only 50us but it still means a pair of cycles on
nowadays CPU. If memory serves me right, the reset can take quite some
time per 802.3. So I would simply schedule_timeout() if going through
the while() loop is required at all.
