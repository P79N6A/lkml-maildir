David,
   What is your real problem with La Monte's Code.
   I don't buy your more "blessed than thou" argument.
   It is a typical response one normally sees in large
   organizations from folk with "empires" to protect.
   Coming from the "land of warring tribes" firm it is
   a attitude I have seen often.  My response is take 
   a vacation, chill out and reassess.
