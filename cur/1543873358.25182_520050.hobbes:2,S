that is nice too, but it has some disadvantages as well in practice. For 
example i often want to see 'everything' that belongs to an arch in just 
one subdirectory. That way one can grep it for example, instead of 
having to grep two separate places. Symlinks would be fine for that, but 
an explicit split not really i think - unless we can get some really 
significant chunk of code into that hierarchy, so that it makes 
functional /sense/ to look at it in isolation.
with the prefix suggestion we can keep these 'shared' files merged in a 
single, main functional tree (x86_64), but still have them marked in the 
VFS as being shared. But ... either way is fine to me - no strong 
feelings, really.
