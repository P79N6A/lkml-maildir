yes, that's what i'm working towards - separating type from 
implementation on the arch level was the first step needed. I already 
had it at such a state yesterday (complete separation of type 
definitions, API definitions and asm implementation - it needed the 
initializers in the asm/spinlock_types.h file, but otherwise it was 
straightforward), but undid it in the last minute because sched.c and 
kernel_lock.c used some intermediate/raw primitives, leading to ugly 
dependencies. I'll re-try this angle today and repost the patch.
