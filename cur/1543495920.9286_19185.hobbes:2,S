Subject: [PATCH] ide_open is too permissive
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The SCSI code (sd_open) returns -ENXIO if one tries to open
a nonexistent partition of an exiting disk. Good.
But the IDE code just succeeds in the corresponding
situation. This means that attempts to mount a nonexistent
partition yield nonsense like
May 16 14:20:03 nata kernel: 03:0c: rw=0, want=1, limit=0
May 16 14:20:03 nata kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
May 16 14:20:03 nata kernel: hda<: bad access: block=0, count=1
May 16 14:20:03 nata kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:0c (hda), sector 0
in the syslog. The patch below makes ide_open fail in this situation.
(Maybe the surrounding `if (drive->media == ide_disk)' is too
cautious - I have not thought about what other IDE devices there
are, and what meaning the minor could have for them.)
