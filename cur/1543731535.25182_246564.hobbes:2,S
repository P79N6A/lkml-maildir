Theres some truth. And its really arguably, but I think, I see your point.
And taking on the situation with reiser4 with "smartmost VFS" approach,
time should pass and with time and expirience on hands it will be evident what
should go in VFS. Now its may be too early.
Considering "amazing PR skills" of Hans Reiser it was the only viable way
to get this changes in VFS. Cause, ironically, mr. Hellwig that currently
demand it to be scrapped out or go in VFS would instakill Hans Reiser
(i know many people would:) if he only touched holy cow of VFS for any
reiser4 purpose.
As I told before, some technically right things just do not work in this
imperfect world. You have to count with social issues, and Hans Reiser
wont, he just avoid them whenever its possible.
