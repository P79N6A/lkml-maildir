It would be easier, to fix the printk's, than to put evlogging into any
particular piece of the kernel.

this could also be fixed as easily as adding evloging.

Evlog side-by-side with printk adds significat bloat.

I'm not sure what you are saying here, but if  I understand you, this is
a problem with the printk calls written by the author.  There is nothing
in evlog that will make this significatly easier for evlog as opposed to
evlog, and now you have two almost identical mechanisims to maintain.

this is a post processing problem.  To speak to Martins issue of
interspersed messages, it would be easy enough, to make sure that each
call to printk starts with a new line, and prepends id information to
sort the messages.  What I hear you asking for, is to make it more of
the kernels responsibilty easing the problem of analysing the out put,
as opposed to making that the responsibilty of user space
postprocessing.  One thing to keep in mind, 99% of logged messages will
never be reviewed.

But poorly implemented, a new format will in pratice increase the
volume, and with the increased complexity of the logging also slowing
down, logging will be slower, and more messages will be lost.  This has
been seen in pratice.

I would prefer to see effort expended on fixing printk/klogd...off the
top of my head:
- make printk a macro that prepends file/function/line to the message.
- fix printk calls: messages with consistent format, calls in the right
places, with the "correct" information.
- postprocessing tools for analysing the logs.
I would say that this is probably less work than implementing evlog,
much less work to maintain, and provide generally better performance.
