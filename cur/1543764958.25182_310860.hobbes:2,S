Oh crap.

You have to be joking me ? geez.

Yeah, ok, I understand what's going on now. There isn't a notion
of projecting priority across into the Unix/Linux kernel traditionally
which is why it seemed so bizarre.

Some of this stuff sounds like recursive locking. Would this be a
better expression to solve the "top level API locking" problem
you're referring to ?

I would think that there will have to be a graph discontinuity
between user/kernel spaces at kernel entry and exit for the deadlock
detector. Can't say about issues at fork time, but I would expect
that those objects would have to be destroyed when the process exits.
The current RT (Ingo's) lock isn't recursive nor is the deadlock
detector the last time I looked. Do think that this is a problem
for legacy apps if it gets overload for being the userspace futex
as well ? (assuming I'm understanding all of this correctly)

I would think that pushing as much of this into userspace would
make the kernel hooks for it more acceptable. Don't know.
