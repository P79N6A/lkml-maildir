Your posting was probably missing the Dmitry Torokhov CC (input guru,
as can be seen in MAINTAINERS).

Oh, interesting stuff. Thus let me try a cheap shot at this reward ;-):
did you run Windows driver debug message monitors (VxDMon or so)
to go fishing for some suspicious/insightful driver activities?
A last desperate resort might be running some Windows plug'n play
device viewers which might tell you more than the usual dull
Windows environment stuff.
But I'm most likely not telling you any cool new things anyway...
