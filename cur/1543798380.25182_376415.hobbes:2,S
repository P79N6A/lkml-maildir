The fact that somebody may take advantage of a stable API should not lead us 
to reject the idea per se.

That would be sad.
The objective of a stable API would be to aid the collective effort and not 
to divide it.

If you are working alone a stable API would be overkill.  But GNU/Linux is a 
collective effort, where stability is paramount to aid scalability.
I hope the concepts here are clear.

The same goes for OpenSource in general, but GNU/OpenSource has a larger 
community and therefore is in greater need of a stable API.

You got me here!  It's really common sense as in:
stability breeds scalability, and instability breeds chaos.

No troll! Just being IMHO. I hope that's OK?
Of course, if your aim is not to be scalable then please ignore this message 
as it will not have any meaning.
Thanks!
