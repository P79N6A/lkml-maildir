I had a gcc patch which made enum typing strict for C
(-Wstrict-enums), which was designed for the GFP_xxx case and things
like it (you make them enums).  It was against 2.95.2, RSN I should
update it, and (as Tridge suggested) make it an __attribute__.
For runtime checks (which are never as good) you could change the GFP_
defined to set the high bit.
