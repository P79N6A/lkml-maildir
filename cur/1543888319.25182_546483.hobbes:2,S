Just an(quick) another idea. Say, the load balancer would consider not
only p->load_weight but also something like Tw(task) =
(time_spent_on_runqueue / total_task's_runtime) * some_scale_constant
as an additional "load" component (OTOH, when a task starts, it takes
some time for this parameter to become meaningful). I guess, it could
address the scenarios your have described (but maybe break some others
as well :) ...
Any hints on why it's stupid?
