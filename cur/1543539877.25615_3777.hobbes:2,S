They can and probably will. With the new approach he is advocating to
them, Linux doesn't need to filter the commands - the drive does, and logs
any inappropriate commands for the manufacturer.

Ah. Personally, I'd say a single boot disk could/should be MORE
user-friendly, not less. Any user attempting a flash upgrade should know
how to boot from a CD or floppy, at least - after that point, the vendor's
program can do whatever it wants by way of hand-holding.

These commands would not be regarded as potentially dangerous ones in the
same way. Writing CDs is a CD-R drive's function, so it won't block that.

Andre is now trying to get the vendors to do this in the drive firmware
instead, which avoids the issue for Linux.
