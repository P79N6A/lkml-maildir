It's not a few files if you have large numbers of tasks. It's an 
interface that fundamentally wasn't designed to scale, and futzing
around tweaking the thing isn't going to cut it, it needs a different
design. I'm not proposing throwing out any of the old simple interfaces,
just providing something efficient as a data gathering interface for
those people who wish to use it.
