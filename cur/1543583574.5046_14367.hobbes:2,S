Ok, I see your point and I agree.
There is still the need, in the ioctl we use the "select" what need to be
mapped by the next mmap, to ask for the "legacy IO range of the bus where
the card reside" (if it exist of course). That would be the 0-64k (or less,
actually a couple of pages would probably be enough) that generates IO cycles
in the "low" addresses used for VGA registers on the card.
