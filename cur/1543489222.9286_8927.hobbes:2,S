Could somebody tell me what to change in the kernel sources -
I guess it's just a #define statement - to try and see whether
I safely can increase it to, say, 8 in my production
environment?

If you go an solve a big problem by breaking down the task into
smaller pieces which in turn can recursively break themself down
into smaller pieces you quite naturally end up with a situation
where you need a bigger number of recursions in symlinks. From
my point of via a statement like saying that recursive symlinks
are not a good programming style does not reflect much of good
programming practice.
