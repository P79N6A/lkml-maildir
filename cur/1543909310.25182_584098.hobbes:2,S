It's essentially only lance, meth, b44 and bcm43xx and lots of s390.
meth is only used on SGI O2s which are not that slow and unlikely
to work in tree anyways.
b44 and bcm43xx run in fast enough new systems to have no trouble
with copies.
s390 won't change.
That only leaves lance. If it runs in a system with <= 16MB 
of memory is fine. I checked with David if he would consider
adding a second destructor to the skb for this case and he 
said no. Which was an answer which was fine for m.e
So the only systems really affected are lance systems with >16MB.
I don't think we can stop Linux evolution for those sorry. They'll
just have to live with it.
