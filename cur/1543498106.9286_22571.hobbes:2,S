There are a lot of devices that can be multiplexed. With a million minor
numbers you can sanely do things like "industrial controllers all live
on major 395". We also get back the 7 majors for each block subsystem 
we dont need any more
And we do need to reclaim a few of the bogus majors issued now for things
that should be using generic APIs or misc devices.

I'd give NFSv2 another 30 years. I believe NFSv4 draft is also 32bit
