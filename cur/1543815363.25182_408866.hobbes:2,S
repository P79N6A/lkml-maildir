Agree, changeset should be part of version

I think we had a good discussion but short of agreement. Some tools want to 
read a file from /sys/hypervisor/ rather than call a c lib. (In other words, 
not all tools will talk to the hypervisor.) It is appropriate to view the 
hypervisor as a hardware device so it is appropriate to have some information 
in sysfs. 
I appreciate the counter argument as well, but think this should be a 
configurable option. 
thanks, 
Mike
