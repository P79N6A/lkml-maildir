[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SL82C105 should not be PPC/ARM specific
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
kernel-source-2.4.9/drivers/ide/Config.in:
	 if [ "$CONFIG_PPC" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_ARM" = "y" ]; then
	    bool '    Winbond SL82c105 support' CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SL82C105
	 fi
The ALR Revolution 2XL dual-x86 (well, celeron) motherboard does, in
fact, use this controller:
00:02.0 IDE interface: Symphony Labs SL82c105 (rev 06) (prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
        I/O ports at fcd0
and if I bludgeon the config so that it actually builds, it does work
(under 2.2, regrettably in pio-only mode, but I'll try 2.4.9 shortly)
W82C105: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 10
W82C105: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xfcd0-0xfcd7, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
SL82C105 command word: 5
IDE timing: 00001313, resetting to PIO0 timing
IDE control/status register: 08ff0801
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel Config IDE block architecture x86
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
2.2.19, 2.4.9 (from inspection of source)
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)

     problem (if possible)

[7.5.] PCI information ('lspci -vvv' as root)
00:02.0 IDE interface: Symphony Labs SL82c105 (rev 06) (prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
        Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-

        Latency: 2 min, 40 max, 64 set, cache line size 08
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 0
        Region 4: I/O ports at fcd0
[7.6.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)
[7.7.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
The hedrick IDE backport doesn't change this either.
