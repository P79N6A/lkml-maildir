Not an endangered species ... even if Tux does like to

That's for "Cardbus hotplug".  I've had USB hotplugging fine,
with the iffy bits being when it combines with the network
hotplugging ... those async changes seem to have created some
deadlocking paths (while removing some others).

The root cause seems to be the Cardbus/PCI hotplug invocation not
happening for you.
Was this with or without the "pcmcia_cs" package installed?  My
own take on it is that 2.4 _should_ hotplug that controller
just fine if "pcmcia_cs" isn't installed.  Otherwise, I'd be
pleasantly surprised to know it works properly.

No -- you were seeing the USB hotplug event, not the cardbus one.
Plugging a cardbus OHCI into your machine should cause two hotplug
events ... first for PCI, eventually modprobing "usb-ohci", and
then as that module initializes you'll get a second one for USB,
reporting a new (root) hub.
So you should see an invocation "arguments (pci) env (...)"
followed by "arguments (usb) env (...)"; but you reported the
second one.
