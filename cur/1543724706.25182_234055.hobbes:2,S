I can't reproduce the bug on any of my hardware right now (it was there
once, it's gone now). But Jesper Juhl can and he's narrowing down what
makes the difference between those drivers.
Can you guys send me your .config? And btw, does using an old via-rhine
driver (say from vanilla 2.6.7) with 2.6.8-rc1 fix the problem?
