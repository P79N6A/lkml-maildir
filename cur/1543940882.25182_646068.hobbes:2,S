Attached. Again, both runs with this command to print ...
for((i=1; i<1001;i++)); do echo $i | lpr -Plp; done
In the good file (lo.good), look for this timestamp (08:38:11.818587)
when it paused then continue again at 08:38:22.477261. That's almost
11 seconds of "sleep" ... (may be a feature of TCP/IP?).
In the bad file (lo.bad), look for 08:47:55.434722 where it paused,
and then continue at
08:48:24.449176. That's 28 seconds of sleep. But, after it continued,
lpstat shows it's printing a job every 3 seconds. All 100 jobs take
approx 1400 seconds to complete as compared to under 100 seconds for
the good run.
Again, using latest linux, one with
17311393f969090ab060540bd9dbe7dc885a76d5 reverted, and the other
without.
Thanks,
Jeff.
