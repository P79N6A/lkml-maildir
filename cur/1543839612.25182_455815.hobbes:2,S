It has always resulted in an unsafe errno value, my patch just fixes it on
a few architectures and makes it safe there. Note that never even noticed
execve returning -1 on some architectures and -errno on others, and if
execve succeeds, errno is never assigned anyway.

Right, thanks for pointing this out.

The direction in which this patch goes is to kill off kernel syscalls
entirely. The main problem there is that kernel_execve needs an architecture
specific implementation (calling sys_execve does the wrong thing), so doing
it all in one step would require knowing how to do it on all 20 architectures.
Once the execve kernel syscall is gone, errno can die with it.
