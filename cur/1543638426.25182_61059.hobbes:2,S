Cacheable and side-effects don't go together.  Even without explicit
software prefetches, most modern CPUs will happily and aggressively
prefetch stuff from cacheable translations.
That's (partly) why we have this strange situation where execution in
virtual address space is actually _faster_ than in physical space,
even though the former involves more work per memory access.
