A zillion locks each with a single purpose is a lot more fun than 1 
lock with a zillion different uses.

OK, I agree a simple spinlock is not the way to go because I now see 
the sleepable operations in there.  But, I don't think 
driverfs_get_inode() needs any more locking.  The inode that it 
references is freshly allocated and my only concern would be about 
access from the inode_in_use list.  Maybe down()ing i_sem will provide 
a bit more protection, but unless the access through inode_in_use is 
already a problem, i_sem isn't needed.  Any thoughts, Al?
