Unfortunately this doesn't work either.  The two asms are ordered with 
respect to each other, but there's nothing to 1) stop the MARK_CALL from 
being moved out between them, 2) something else being moved in between 
them.  I don't really see a way out of this without implementing the 
whole call in assembler as well, which is a big pain.
