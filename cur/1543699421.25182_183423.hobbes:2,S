Hello,
On Sun, 26 Oct 2003, Guennadi Liakhovetski posted patch for
AM53c974 driver. May be it is not perfect, but it is still not applied
to kernel source. I think it is better to have at least not broken
driver compared with existing.
I have Compaq deskpro XL 590 PC with integrated such controler, and this
driver affter applinig Guennadi Liakhovetski pach to 2.6.0-test11 source
works for me.
Best regards
Tomas Martisius
