OK, I prefer rq->data_len means the true data length though you prefer
rq->data_len means the allocated buffer length (the true data length
plus padding and drain). We agree on other things. We can live with
either way.
Jens, what's your preference?

No, I don't, as I explained above. As long as rq->data_len means the
true data length, I'm fine. I knew that James' drain buffer patch
breaks rq->data_len == sum(sg). I don't care about it. I can
understand that drivers wants to a perfect sglist.
