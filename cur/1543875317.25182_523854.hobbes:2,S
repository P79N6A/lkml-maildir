No, this one is not present in 2.6.20 and this error doesn't (head=
317ec6cd00f25d05d153a780bc178c5335f320ee) occur with NO_HZ=n and
HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n
This error is maybe related with this commit:

    [PATCH] clockevents: Fix suspend/resume to disk hangs
    I finally found a dual core box, which survives suspend/resume without
    crashing in the middle of nowhere. Sigh, I never figured out from the
    code and the bug reports what's going on.
    The observed hangs are caused by a stale state transition of the clock
    event devices, which keeps the RCU synchronization away from completion,
    when the non boot CPU is brought back up.
    The suspend/resume in oneshot mode needs the similar care as the
    periodic mode during suspend to RAM. My assumption that the state
    transitions during the different shutdown/bringups of s2disk would go
    through the periodic boot phase and then switch over to highres resp.
    nohz mode were simply wrong.
    Add the appropriate suspend / resume handling for the non periodic
    modes.
