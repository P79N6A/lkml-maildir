This whole issue was because Canada has -- apparently -- agreed to
enforce U.S. law (w.r.t. "U.S." goods) in order to receieve virtually
no restrictions on U.S.->Canada exports.  That obviously means,
somewhere, there is a Canadian regulation which states to what extent
Canadian authorities will enforce the export regulations imposed by
the U.S.
