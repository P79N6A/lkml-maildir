We upgraded from a 2.0.34 kernel to 2.2.12 (Red Hat 4.2 -> 6.1) and since then
the 2.2.12 kernel will ping/trace to any other machine on the network, except
Livingston PortMaster 3, is there some sort of protocol bug with 2.2.12 or
the PM3?  Anyone that may be able to help, it would be greatly appreciated,
searched around on the net and didn't find anything, but I will continue on.
