I guess it would be better to use the resources frame work here. 
Before checking EBDA check if it is already reserved. Then lguest/Xen
can reserve these areas and stop using it.

Sorry, but that's an extremly ugly and clumpsy interface and will lead
to extensive code duplication in hypervisors because so much code
is disabled.
This needs to be solved in some better way.
