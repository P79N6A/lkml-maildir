Yes, they are completely orthogonal and can co-exist.

See figure 10, SAS Domain class diagram, in SAS1r09e.  It cross-links
you to SAM-3 (you can also use SAM-4).

It is a _layer_ just like it is in SAM and SPC and SAS.
It is a _layer_ by SCSI design, if you look in SAM.
SAS is not libsas, but a transport _layer_ sitting between
the interconnect (hardware) and SCSI Core (SAM/SPC).
I wish I could do something to convince you, but you have
to convince yourself of this reading SAM and trying
to draw it out (literally) yourself.  Try it for
an SPI domain, FC domain and SAS domain, and then you'll
see it.
The sysfs representation is just a perk of the transport
layer, it is owned and operated by the transport layer.
"transport attribute class" is just an _attribute_ class, Christoph.
"transport layer" is a lot more involved.  I sincerely hope
you can see this.  E.g. domain discovery belongs in the transport
layer.  In SPI, LLDDs did it; in MPT the firmware does it.
With SAS, the domain is passive, and the protocol has evolved
enough (due to SAM) to yield to a common transport layer,
where common routines are done, as the SAS code shows.
The _next_ new protocol after SAS, will also adhere to SAM.
It will not happen tomorrow, but it will come around.
The less we invent our own stuff, and the more we adhere
to a spec, the easier we'd support new techonologies, since
they will adhere to SAM.

P.S. You know when I mentioned "SCSI" above, I did _not_ mean
SCSI-2 or SCSI (Parallel SCSI).  I meant SCSI-3 (SAM).
