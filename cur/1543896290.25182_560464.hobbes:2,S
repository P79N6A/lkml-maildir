Because serio interface is mostly used with input devices. For all other
devices I think universal answer is "userspace" but with input devices
we want to do processing in kernel so we can route events into console
and other standard interfaces (although one coudl use uinput to achieve
similar result).

Not sure. Could you check /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/id/* and verify
that inputattach sets up serio port properly?
