Agreed, but I think most driver authors will not know what is ugly
and bogus code, otherwise they would probably not copy it... (I hope!)

Don't you mean, hwif->mmio==2 for MMIO hardware?

hmmmm.  Please consider reversing this:
Make ide_init_hwif_ports() present _only_ if IDE_ARCH_OBSOLETE_INIT
is defined.
Then add that define for all arches that still use ide_init_hwif_ports().

Maybe provide generic definitions, so that new arches don't even
have to care about this?
