From Madam Laarni E.Enriquez
Dear Friend,
I am madam Laarni Entriquez, a native of Philippine nationality, and a 
divorcee.I would like to have a long lasting and confidant 
relationship with you,if possible  entrusting my life time fortune 
into your possession,as now I am broken hearted and needs someone to 
trust,without remembering my past and forsaken experiences from close 
confidants and family.
I need someone, who would take me for whom I am and as a life time 
partner , after making claims of my deposited life fortuned in 
Abroad.Well, from your profile, I believe in me that you ought to be a 
very honest person.I would like to give you a brief description of my 
life.I was once the mistress of our President, Joseph Estrada, and 
during his tenure in office, I was been used as a courier to 
depositing his funds, in the Europe, but due to the fracas I had with 
his wife, Madam Loi and her sone, Jude, it causes a public 
embarrasement and people came to know that I had been having an affair 
with the President.
But, not quite long, I was arrested, together with his wife and son, 
in connection with the 27th July, 2003, failed coup,which I did not 
have anything to do with, but was alleged that I have been habouring 
some of the dessident and arms in one of the villa, bought for me by 
the President.But, now, I have been released and I am under security 
watch and seriously monitored. All, I wanted from you is to assist me 
make claims of some funds, I did deposited in Europe and west 
Africa,as the other deposits documents have been consficated and 
seized by the government of Madam Gloria, the President.
But,this one is the only one they could not see,as I did kept the 
documents with one of my close confidant, who was also arrested. The 
Amount being deposited is much about 10.2 million Euros, 
as this was the money that was supposed to be used by the President to 
aquire some properties in America, Europe and Africa.All, I want from 
you, now is honesty and sincerity,as, as soon as this money is claimed 
by you, I will look for a way out and sneaked out of Philippines and 
travel down to meet you,as the demourage of the consignment is 
increasing day to day, moreover,I have been paying the sum of about 40 
Euros daily.So we can go into a life time partnership together,in 
investing this money in your country and anywhere else you prefer. I 
will send you my Photo, which I have with me and the Only one left.My 
private mail address is below, please do reply via it.
Sincerely yours,
Madam Laarni E.Enriquez
