That one I have issues with too, as I said its about what it says.

Its a goal. It doesn't say it is, whats the problem ? Together sure you
have a couple of legs to stand on.
So if it said
	"BitBucket: a GPL version control project"
or
	"BitBucket: a tool for extracting Bitkeeper repositories"
"The goal of this project is to produce a tool to free bitkeeper data 
 from Larry McVoy"
we'd all be happy and could go back to sleep ?
