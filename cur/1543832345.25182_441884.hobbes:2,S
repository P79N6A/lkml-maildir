ok now a counter voice, and I'm sure I'm not going to be popular by
saying this:
Multiple all-half-working implementations is insane. It means bugs don't
get fixed, it means there isn't going to be ANY implementation that is
good enough for a broad audience. People will just switch to another one
rather than reporting and causing even the most simple bugs to get
fixed. What is worse, these suspend systems will inevitable have
different requirements on the rest of the kernel, and will thus
complicate the heck out of it for the rest of the developers. This in
turn will make *all* implementations more fragile, and everyone loses.
Very often, choice is good. but for something this fundamental, it is
not. We also don't have 2 scsi layers for example.
Now as to which it should be; I believe whatever happens it has to be
simple and robust. No fancy shnazy GUI inside the kernel, but SIMPLE.
Including well a defined and portable set of requirements on the kernel
and drivers, and done such that driver people who don't know the fine
details, can still get their drivers right.
