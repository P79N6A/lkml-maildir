Hi all!  You may have noticed this already, but in case not, on my system,
slhc.c doesn't get compiled as a module.  I had to add an 
MX_OBJS += slhc.o at the end of the Makefile in drivers/net to get it to
compile and install as a module (I know, not exact, but Makefiles are a
mystic science to me ;)
