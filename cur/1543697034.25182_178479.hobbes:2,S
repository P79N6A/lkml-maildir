Yes, I am sure.  I had ACPI enabled (on request by Linus)
and the messages are about the APIC.
As far as I understand this, the situation is as follows:
The original problem was related to the APIC and the
multiprocessor (here: hyper-threading) configuration.  The
system tries to use ACPI to acquire information about the
multiprocessor configuration.  If ACPI succeeded in doing
so, then my kernel would not try to read the mptable, and
the crash would not occur.
I hope this helps,
Jochen
