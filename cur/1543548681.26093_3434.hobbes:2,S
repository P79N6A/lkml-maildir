I guess it would just be a library call. e.g. the BSDs just have a disksort()
function that is called from the drivers as needed. For smart devices
with very intelligent firmware you simply do not call it (assuming you
have decently sized kiovec requests, with the current bh approach some 
premerging is probably always needed)
