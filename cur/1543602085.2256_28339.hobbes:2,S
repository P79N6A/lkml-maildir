Maybe this is something worth to have a look at:
http://evlog.sourceforge.net/
It seems to be an "enterprise-class advanced event logging system for
Linux", trying toi be compliant with upcoming POSIX Standard 1003.25,
"System API - Services for Reliable, Available, and Serviceable Systems".
It requires kernel patches and userspace logging daemon to work. Kernel
patches are available for 2.4.4 and as I can see from the kernel patch, it
is little intrusive (hardly any changes to existing kernel code, and adds
a couple of new files). It also requires a patched glibc, but the required
patch (for glibc2.2.3) is very little.
