Ted,
if you look into the bugreport I sent you recently, you will find 
a line that's doing exactly that. (setserial /dev/ttyS1 uart none)

Tom is right. _I_ personally have no problem using any other setserial options.
But many hamradio users are too clueless to figure that out themselves.
Especially as the HOWTO explicitely says 'use setserial /dev/ttySxx uart none'
It'd be nice if that behaviour could be preserved.
Bye,
Thorsten.
