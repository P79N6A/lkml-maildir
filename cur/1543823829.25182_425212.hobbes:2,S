Hi Greg!
First of all, i hope you arent angry about having me sent this reply
as CC to the current maintainer and to the mailing list. If so, I
apologize, and it wont happen in future.
> Hm, your tabs and spaces are messed up :(
I reviewed the original file again, and the lines just above mine
indeed have spare leading whitespaces. Shall  I include changing them
in my patch? I really dont know wether it just will ok, or will make
it harder to identify what i actually did in patch.  I have to excuse
myself for asking about those details, but this is my very first
kernel patch ever. (For now, I left the whitespaces as I found them in
the source file. Please, clue me on how to deal with those, wehen i
encounter them again.)
So, here's my corrected patch again:
FROM: Eduard Warkentin <eduard.warkentin@gmx.de>
Added support for detetcion an dworking with a ASIX 88178 based
USB-Gigabit
adaptor. With the patch, it is detected and handled correctly by the asix
module.
