Hi there,
we are running diskless here.
DHCP works fine. However the mount does not work with 2.6-test2:
Jul 29 17:03:39 roulade rpc.mountd: bad path in mount request from 
139.153.168.129: "139.153.168.134:/clients/root/sauerkraut"
The same with 2.4.21:
Jul 29 17:06:07 roulade rpc.mountd: authenticated mount request from 
sauerkraut.cn.stir.ac.uk:800 for /clients/root/sauerkraut 
(/clients/root/sauerkraut)
Grub:
title Kernel network
dhcp
root (nd)
kernel /clients/tftpboot/sauerkraut/bzImage root=/dev/nfs ip=dhcp
#
#
title Krnl-2.6 network
dhcp
root (nd)
kernel /clients/tftpboot/sauerkraut/bzImage-2.6 root=/dev/nfs ip=dhcp
The path is supplied by the DHCP server. Maybe there's something 
wrong? I'll try to supply it explicitely now.
/Bernd
