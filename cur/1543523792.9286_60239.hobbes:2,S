     I hate to jump into this, but I also hate to see this scheduler idea
ditched for invalid reasons.
     The code isn't going to get into the cache and displace your application
just because it exists in the kernel.  To get into the cache it actually has to
be fetched. 
     Since the scheduler is adaptive, the new code, other than the test, is
only going to executed under the heavy load conditions.  Surely the test isn't
1kbyte or anywhere close to it?
