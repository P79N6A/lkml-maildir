st_dev is irrelevant in the context of CD burning.
In the context of mounted files, the only guarantee given by POSIX is
that st_dev and st_ino for a particular file is unique.  But that
clearly is true while the containing filesystem is mounted.  Even with
Solaris, if a particular removable filesystem is unmounted and removed
from one device (say one Jazz/Zip drive) and inserted into another
device (say another Jazz/Zip drive), st_dev will change --- while the
system is running.
So your claim is __still__ false.
Please try again and give a fully formed argument, and assume that
your discussion partners might know what they are talk about in the
future.
