Well, why reset the scsi bus on resume then?
That seems unnecessary.  At suspend time the devices simply 
don't get more requests. (Except perhaps spin-down 
requests for disks.)  Then nothing much happens.  Eventually
the system wakes up, and requests appear again.  First spin-up
requests, then ordinary io.
Quite a few scsi bioses have an option for not resetting
the bus when booting.  Less delay, and necessary for those
few with a shared scsi bus.  Seems a reset won't be
necessary for suspend/resume either, which is supposed to
be a lighter operation than a reboot.
If your scsi adapter don't support this - it isn't
suspend/resume compatible the way I see it.
