Right now there is only one serious false positive I know about.
	put_user(0, dirent->d_name)
and its equivanlents in some places.  That's __typeof__() handling bug.
The rest is easy to spot - ## handling is broken in minimally tricky
cases, [arg] is not recognized in asm arguments, some __attribute__()
are not recognized and string constant length limits sometimes bite
in asm bodies.
The rest of patchset (~360Kb right now, and it will grow more) does include
several splittings of structs, BTW.  It removes pretty much all noise on
my alpha / amd64 / x86 builds; the rest is real issues.
Probably the worst annoyance is iovec - there is almost no intersection
between the code that expects kernel pointers in it with code that expects
userland ones (majority).  I hadn't split that one, but that's worth
considering.
sync kiocb is a disaster waiting to happen.
->write() of tty_driver will take some research - we might want to try and
keep copying from userland in generic code instead of just splitting the
method, but that will require figuring out the locking issues.
A bunch of set_fs() users in compat code is simply broken and should be
using compat_alloc_user_space() instead.  They end up with a mix of kernel
and userland pointers, and set_fs(KERNEL_DS) is not enough to handle that.
console code has some moderately minor annoyances; compared to the ugliness
of the entire code in that area they are not too interesting.
One thing I would _really_ hate to see is use of typecasts just to shut
sparse up - the point is to find the potentially problematic places, not
to hide them.  We probably need a flag for sparse that would warn about
explicit typecasts changing noderef and address_space inside the pointers;
it obviously won't help the casts to unsigned long and back, but those
are presumably used when people really mean it.
