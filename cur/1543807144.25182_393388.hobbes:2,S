ncursesw is now first choice.
What does following command print:
gcc -print-file-name=libncursesw.so
If it prints just libncursesw.so then this is not the issue.
But if it prints a full path similar to:
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/3.4.4/../../../../lib64/libncursesw.so
then this may be the case.
Try to rename ncursesw to ncurses in
scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-dialog.sh
to test if ncursesw is the culprint.
Thanks,
	Sam
