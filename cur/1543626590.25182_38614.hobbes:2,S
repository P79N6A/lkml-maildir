It's still usable, but under rather specific conditions, namely:
 - both sleeper and waker in process context and with BKL held.
 - OR if missing a wakeup isn't a horrible problem.
And there does seem to be a lot of legacy users out there.
I wouldn't mind a spring cleaning, but the fact is that right now in
2.5.x I'd rather have driver writers wake up to the fact that we had a
spring cleaning in the block layer several months ago, rather than
introduce a new one ;)
