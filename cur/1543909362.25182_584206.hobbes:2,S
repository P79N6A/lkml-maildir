Yes, if people actually want to use this particular metric a lot (and
I obviously personally think it makes a lot of sense), then it should
be done in kernel like this.

Hmm, what's that shift for? Oh, you're doing fixed-point math.
64-bit divisions are quite expensive on some platforms. The compiler
might be able to do something smarter with common constants like:
   if (mapcount == 1)
      mss->pss += PAGE_SIZE;
   else if (mapcount == 2)
      mss->pss += PAGE_SIZE / 2;
   else if (mapcount == 3)
      mss->pss += PAGE_SIZE / 3;
   else if (mapcount == 4)
      mss->pss += PAGE_SIZE / 4;
   else
      mss->pss += PAGE_SIZE / mapcount;
..but I don't know. I suspect we'll at least want to special-case
mapcount == 1 though.

And then you're throwing away 22 bits of precision. 10 bits wasn't
enough? Hmmm.. Looks like the worst case is sharing a 4k page 2049
ways, where we'll be off by .999 bytes per 4k page for nearly 50%
error. Your extra 12 bits drops this to .2% error, so I suppose it's
worth it.
But it probably needs a comment.

Unrelated change.
