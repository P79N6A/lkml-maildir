   You mean the "$CONFIG_JOLIET" = "y" ?
   The only users of CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT in 2.4 that I can find are fat and
   smbfs. The condition for enabling nls is:
   if [ "$CONFIG_JOLIET" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_FAT_FS" != "n" \
	   -o "$CONFIG_NTFS_FS" != "n" -o "$CONFIG_NCPFS_NLS" = "y" \
	   -o "$CONFIG_SMB_FS" != "n" ]; then
   If you enable nls you also get a CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.
Oops, you're right.  Ignore my previous message on this subject.
