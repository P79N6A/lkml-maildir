NH> I've not heard of SunDisk.  SunDisk->SanDisk == Typo?
Nope. It was called SunDisk at first but then Sun told them to change
their name and they changed it to SanDisk. There a CF disks with both
names in the wild. But there's no problem, recent kernels (both 2.4 and
2.6) recognize both names as CFA.
