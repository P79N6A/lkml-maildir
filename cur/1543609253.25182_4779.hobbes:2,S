It may be getting confused with the filesystem blocksize.  Check tune2fs -l
for those devices.

LVM is broken in this regard, unless you have a recent patch (Linus'
kernel does not).  I sent him a patch to fix that, but it did not get in.
What kernel version/LVM do you have?  Are you using LVM on all of these
partitions, or only some?  Did you have filesystems on them? 
Cheers, Andreas
