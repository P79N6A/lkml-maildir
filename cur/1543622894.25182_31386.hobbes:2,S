That sounds very nice, but in practice it means it would never happen, and
you know it. First you have to patch the existing scheduler. Aside from
the work on something which we are about to discard, the patch would have
to go through the maintainer, and the the submitter, and the pope, and
god, and finally Linus, and then (only then) could the patch go in the old
scheduler. Then you start the process with each of the drivers. They are
old grotty drivers, I would bet that no one "maintains" some of them (I'll
actually count when I login to a better machine). 
This process could take six months to a year, after which we can start the
process with the scheduler. Alternatively we can put in the new scheduler,
let the drivers have compile errors, and let them be fixed when (if) they
are still in use.
If we could get a dispensation from Linus to submit one patch combining
the scheduler and all the drivers, it could be done (almost mechanically).
But with the maintainers, submitters, etc, process for each bit, it could
take a year. And dammit the patch is so night and day better that it
shouldn't take a year.
