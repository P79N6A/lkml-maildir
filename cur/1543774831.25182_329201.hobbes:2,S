Allowing the file system to make the full decision and call the proper
function would be fine, but then we'd need generic_forget_inode exported
too :)

Yes, the problem certainly isn't necessarily specific to OCFS2 so I'd be
more than happy to see that as a generic VFS feature. As is, the export and
callback get us past quite a few problems with tracking orphaned inodes in
the cluster.
This however, brings me to a related issue for which I'd appreciate some
advice.
If a node crashes or otherwise fails to complete the unlink(2) then the
inode in qusetion will *not* have actually been orphaned. Of course, the
local node doesn't know this and eventually gets to ocfs2_delete_inode() (via
the MAYBE_ORPHANED flag) which will do the work of determining whether the
inode is actually orphaned. The problem is that by the time we've gotten
there, generic_delete_inode() has done a truncate_inode_pages() which might
throw out data for a file which otherwise wants it on disk.
In fact, because OCFS2 supports POSIX style unlink-while-open across the
entire cluster, we might get to ocfs2_delete_inode() and during the voting
process, discover that the file is still open on another node in which case
we don't want to wipe it but would have lost file data due to the
truncate_inode_pages() anyway.
Essentially, we get to ocfs2_delete_inode() before we have a chance to
take the cluster lock and determine the true state of the inode.  By
then it is too late.  We really need to be able to make the
determination before calling generic_drop_inode(), but drop_inode() is
under the inode lock, and we can't call out to the cluster.  The
question becomes where and how to do this work?
