No, tracking locks individually defeats the power of lockdep, that is
warning of lock inversion before it actually happens. That really
requires classes.
Annotating a tree requires grouping per level, and that isn't
particularly hard (although I haven't yet tried it for the device tree -
doing this conversion is still on my todo list). The hardest part of the
device->sem conversion is the suspend/resume part, where it locks the
whole tree and lockdep is limited in tracking held locks.
