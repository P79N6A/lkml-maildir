Would really prefer not to do this.  system_state is evil.  Its semantics
are poorly-defined and if someone changes them a bit, or changes memory
initialisation order, you get whacked.
I think an mm-private flag with /*documented*/ semantics would be better. 
It's only a byte.

I spent some time trying to work out what "can_online_pfn_into_nid" can
possibly mean and failed.  "We can bring a pfn online then turn it into a
NID"?  Don't think so.  "We can bring this page online and allocate it to
this node"?  Maybe.
Perhaps if the function's role in the world was commented it would be clearer.
