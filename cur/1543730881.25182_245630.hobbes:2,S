Hi Sam,
When building an x86 kernel from a BK tree from a few hours ago with
O=../build-2.6-gx1 I got the following error:
  ccache gcc -Wp,-MD,arch/i386/boot/tools/.build.d -Iarch/i386/boot -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -I/home/icampbell/devel/kernel/i386/linux-2.6-bk/include -Iinclude -I/home/icampbell/devel/kernel/i386/linux-2.6-bk/include2 -Iinclude2  -I/home/icampbell/devel/kernel/i386/linux-2.6-bk/include  -o arch/i386/boot/tools/build /home/icampbell/devel/kernel/i386/linux-2.6-bk/arch/i386/boot/tools/build.c
cc1: No such file or directory: opening dependency file arch/i386/boot/tools/.build.d
Doing "mkdir ../build-2.6-gx1/arch/i386/boot/tools" allowed the build to
continue. It smells like a problem with the hostprogs-y = tools/build in
arch/i386/boot/Makefile not coping with the subdirectory, but I don't
know much about kbuild myself.
Ian.
