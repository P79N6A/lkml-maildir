That is what I meant if not what I communicated.  If you read the code that
is exactly what it is trying to do.

I agree that I don't think the current behaviour makes sense.  I think
the code has accumulated so many small modifications that is very far
from making sense in the corner cases.
arch/i386 either needs to be frozen as a legacy only thing or
it needs to be cleaned up so we can continue to enhance the code.
