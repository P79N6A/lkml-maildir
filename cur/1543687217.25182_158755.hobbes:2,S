It knows the MAC address of the intended receiver, there is
no problem here.

What is the caching problem?  The ARP response is valid, and we
have no reason to believe otherwise.

We're not talking about routing scenerios, we're talking strictly
about packets being originated by an application on the local host.

It uses routes that only have been determined only using the desired
device index.  There is no "interface address" to match up to when
we're trying to send to a multicast address.
