Will do.

Assuming I've followed it right...
The kernel dev_t has 14 major device bits, 18 minor device bits (with
the major as the most significant bits).
On disk there are 32 bits stored in host byte order, the device is in
the [0] indirect offset on Sparc, [1] on x86.
Looking at an individual entry, if the top 16 bits are clear or
0xffff, then the bottom 16 bits are the device number, with 7 bits of
major (most significant), 8 bits of minor (and the most significant
bit unused). If the top 16 bits are some other pattern, the on disk
mapping is the same as the kernel mapping.
