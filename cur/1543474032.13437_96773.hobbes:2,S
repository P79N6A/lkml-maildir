Yes, but those also happen to non-Linux systems, and I have to work with a 
lot of those.  So I deal with them using non-Linux-specific methods --- 
thus, a distribution identifier does nothing useful.
*libc issues don't bother me at all for the same reason --- configure 
already has ways of dealing with those issues, and they also work on DU and 
Solaris and AIX and Ultrix.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
