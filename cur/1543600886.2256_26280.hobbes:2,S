I'm using the SiS 735 motherboard with ATA/100 IDE, I have an Quantum Bigfoot 8.1G drive,
along with two 45G IBM DTLA drives (ATA/100) on controller, I've had no problems beyond
some clicking on one of the IBM drives that also happens on a Promise PCI controller 
(no messages to syslog about it, and S.M.A.R.T. reports no errors (I use smartctl))
2.4.9 kernel..
