Yeah, well we're already talking about a two-level model to accomodate
VMI, since it wants the mostly native SMP stuff except for the actual
apic operations.
Maybe hooking into genapic is the right way to mop up all the uses of
send_IPI and its variants.  But from a quick grep it doesn't look like
they get called from too many places...  Most of the callers seem to be
in arch/i386/kernek/smp.c, so they should be pretty easy to isolate.
