What is included below is the directory listing of a cd created using an ATAPI
cd writer, with which I use the ide-scsi module. As can be seen from the
output below, the ide-cd and ide-scsi behave differently. The file size given
when using ide-cd is correct. I reported this bug before, when using 2.2.12 and
was told to upgrade. I am now using 2.2.14, the latest stable release to my
knowledge. Also, the image seems to be corrupted. I tried a bzip2 -t (test) on 
the file, and it reported corruption. I tried bzip2 -t on the isoimage I
created the cd from (mounting using the loopback device), and it tests out ok.
My setup is as follows:
	kernel 2.2.14, no external patches, SMP
	Dual PII 333, not overclocked
	256MB RAM, no swap
	The CD-Writer is an HP 7200i (internal IDE), latest firmware
