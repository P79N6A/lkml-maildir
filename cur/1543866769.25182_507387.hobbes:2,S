Another source of breakage: you get devm_request_irq() only if you have
GENERIC_HARDIRQS.  Otherwise kernel/irq/ is simply not built.  Again,
you are mixing default implementation of primitives with the
implementation-agnostic stuff around those primitives.  I'd split
kernel/irq/manage.c in two files and have the places providing
alternative implementations (e.g. arch/sparc/kernel) refer to new
file in their makefiles...
I'm mostly done with that stuff, modulo noncoherent_dma breakage.  Will
send patch once the irq crap is dealt with...
