i agree. Here's a bit more detailed analysis: the tracer timestamps 
function entry points. So what we know is that from the call to 
ata_bdma_status(), up to the call to nv_check_hotplug_ck804(), 16.6 
msecs passed. The codepath includes:
 - the whole of the ata_bdma_status() function
 - a small portion of ata_host_intr() [from the point where it returns 
   from the ops->bdma_status() call up to the return]
 - and a small portion of nv_interrupt(), from the ata_host_intr() 
   return to the ->check_hotplug() call.
in this particular case there's only very simple (and non-IO) 
instructions in that codepath (no loops either), except for 
ata_bmdma_status() which does IO ops: so i agree with you that the most 
likely candidate for the delay is the readb() or the inb() in 
ata_bdma_status().
I'm wondering which one of the two. inb()s are known to be horrible on 
some systems - but i've never seen them take 16 milliseconds. If it's 
the inb(), then that could also involve SMM mode and IO 
emulation/bug-workaround BIOS hackery - which could indeed cause such 
delays. [but i havent seen such a thing either.]
the other option is that this is a random delay [e.g. DMA starvation] 
hitting ata_bmdma_status() only by accident. (That looks a bit unlikely 
though, given how related this codepath seems to the whole problem 
area.)
