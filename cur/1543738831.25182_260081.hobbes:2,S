No, the lock is still needed. Thanks for catching this, that was indeed
wrong.

Yes, that's a leftover I forgot to remove.  Will go in the next 
version.
(btw t here is another leftover in there, I will remove it too)

That is what the addr && is for. Yes, overflows happen and afaik they
are all handled.

It's related. The old function just wasn't scalable to 4 level 
page tables at all (i really tried but it was too ugly) so I rewrote it 
completely. Splitting it would be difficult because the 3level version 
would be already very different from the 4level version.
Thanks for the review.
