yes, and to simplify that you need additional commandline parametres 
(debug=1,2,3,4,5 f. ex.).
Those debug levels provide:
1. different verbose levels of printed output, sent to specific logs like 
kern.log for example
2. different hexadecimal outprints who show what sub-part of the driver is 
working as expected and what part is not
3. if the driver is loaded correctly but refuses to work as expected while 
the "traditional" one without "outsourced" ssb backplane works as expected 
there must be some technique to move the what and why into system logs, just 
to establish facts instead of guessing around.
4. If that technique is not provided by the author of the code then that is a 
proof for the author's lack of experience. As I said already: Too many cooks 
do spoil the pap.
If debugging is limited to dmesg, .config and guessing around, then I call 
such a code a real poor and crude one.

Theoretically: yes. Practically: No, due to the personal withdraws of the 
latest cook.
Michael in fact thinks that if he is producing code he can delegate everything 
else to other people, replying "for me it works" like a parrot.
In so far, not only the code itself is quite rude and crude, but the author of 
the code is too, transforming the testing procedure into a torture due to the 
author's (i. e. the latest cook's) proven personal and technical 
incompetence.

You cannot debug the problem for the reasons that I already described, and I 
will not spend my time with this crude stuff anymore.
My proposal is: Gary Zambrowski should revise that code (the only one Cced 
being employed at broadcom.com, the manufacturer).
Until the job is done by Gary Andrew Morton should rip this stuff out of the 
mm-tree for being rude, crude, immature.
