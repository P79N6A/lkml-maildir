Yes, I know, I have seen this after I created the new filesystem while further
searching the net for possible causes of this, that a xfs_metadump is most of 
the time needed to debug this. But as this is a production system the system had 
to go online again as soon as possible, so I just decided
to share the information I've got afterwards. The next time I will do the
xfs_metadump (but then, I hope also that I won't be hit by the problem once again).
