This only happens if _both_ ohci_hcd and ehci_hcd are loaded before the
suspend.

The results are now the same with and without USB_SUSPEND set.  Namely,
if one hcd is loaded before a suspend (either ehci or ohci), it succeeds
(repeatable arbitrary number of times in a row).  However, if both hcds are
loaded before a suspend, it fails (100% of the time) and the messages are
like in the dmesg output attached to the previous message.
I've reproduced this behavior on another x86_64 box.
