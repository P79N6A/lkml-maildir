Yes. And the another reason is _STA is not for representing the presence
of PCI adapter card on the hot-plug slots because ACPI2.0 or later says
"For _HID devices, OSPM evaluates the _STA method. For _ADR devices, OSPM
checks with the bus driver for that device." in the explanation of _EJx.
Since PCI adapter card on a hotplug slot is _ADR device, we must not
provide _STA to represent the presence of PCI adapter card on a hotplug
slot. Please look at the sample ASL codes for PCI hotplug slots in ACPI
spec. There should be no _STA, of course.
This is not described in ACPI1.0b spec and Alex's machine was based on
ACPI1.0b. So I've suggested to check ACPI version in ACPI PCI slot
detection driver. But it turned out that this suggestion didn't work
because HP's ACPI2.0 based machine is doing same as ACPI1.0b based one.

No. Even if we evaluate _STA before _SUN, ACPI PCI slot detection driver
detects all of the slot on Fujitsu machine regardless of slot status
(present or not) because Fujitsu server never provide _STA for representing
presence of PCI adapter card on the slot.
