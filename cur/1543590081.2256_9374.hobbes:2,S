moving block_dev in pagecache won't change anything from userspace point
of view, it's a transparent change (if we ignore the total loss of
cache coherency between block_dev and fs metadata that it implies, but
as Linus said such loss of coherency will happen anyways eventually
because metadata will go into its address space too). Basically there
will still be a use for the block devices as far as there are fsck and
other userspace applications that want to use it.
