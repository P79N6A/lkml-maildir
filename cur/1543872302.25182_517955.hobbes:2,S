I'm not entirely sure it's this part of the code, I would have to do
some more investigations (I didn't get this leak before). An
"unscientific" test shows that if I define get_pid/put_pid in the
tty_io.c file so that pid->count is not affected, the leak disappears.
This doesn't necessarily prove that the fault is here though.

Kmemleak can cope with list heads and rcu delayed freeing as it also
checks for pointer aliases (those accessible via container_of).

I think it's only the pid_chain and rcu member that could be placed in
a list and kmemleak scans the memory for these two offsets as well.
I'll check those lists anyway but I doubt it's a more fundamental
problem with how kmemleak handles struct pid as I should've probably
got more reports.

Yes, indeed, but what kmemleak reports is that the pid structure
wasn't freed yet and there is no way to determine its pointer directly
or via container_of on members (by scanning the memory), hence it is
considered a leak.

Yes, many thanks. I'll dig further and let you know.
