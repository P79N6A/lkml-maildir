That's exactly what I had understood you to mean.  I guess it's just
that using the platform bus for this purpose feels like an abstraction
violation to me due to having platform devices parented off a device on
another bus.  Obviously it's just my model of a platform device that's
wrong here.  I will change the driver to use the platform bus for my
next submission.

Indeed - I mention it mostly for additional motivation.
