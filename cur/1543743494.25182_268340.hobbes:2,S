Well class_simple.c definitely doesn't use class_data/class_set_devdata()
now (and as I said drivers/scsi/st.c is using this on a class_simple
device).  The question is whether you can bless this situation as part
of the API, or whether some time in the future class_simple might
start using class_data.
