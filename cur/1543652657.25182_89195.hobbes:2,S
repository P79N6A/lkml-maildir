I had a need for it in a sample kprobes driver where I wanted to verify that
some address
was a valid kernel space address before I handed a probe to kprobes.
So I would do something like:
if (!valid_kernel_address(probe->addr)) {
    ret = -EINVAL;
    goto out;
}
register_kprobe(probe);
and then kpboes will go and attempt to set *(probe->addr) = BREAK_POINT;
