Yes.  CONFIG_SECURITY=n makes it all go away.  But if your mind isn't
completely closed on the topic, you might want to read some of the
following published papers before concluding that it is nonsense:
1) The Inevitability of Failure:  The Flawed Assumption of Security in
Modern Computing Environments, available online from
http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/inevit-abs.html.
2) The published papers about SELinux from the 2001 FREENIX and 2001
OLS, available online from 
http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/docs.html.
3) The published papers about LSM from the 2002 Usenix Security and
2002 OLS, available online from 
http://lsm.immunix.org/lsm_doc.html.
