So what is needed?  I apparently have an older tulip based on the
following and comments which seem to indicate older cards work with
0.89H and have problems with 0.91:
tulip.c:v0.89H 5/23/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
eth1: Digital DC21041 Tulip at 0xe800, 21041 mode, 00 c0 f0 37 22 56,
IRQ 11.
eth1:21041 Media information at 30, default media 0800 (Autosense).
eth1:  21041 media #0, 10baseT.
eth1:  21041 media #0, 10baseT.
Do we need to download Donald's 0.91 and test it or what?
