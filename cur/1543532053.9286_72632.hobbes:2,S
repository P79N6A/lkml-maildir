Just tried to compile 2.3.99pre3 on my VESA-bus 486 with SoundBlaster 16
support as a module and PCI not configured.
Compilation failed in soundcard.c with "invalid lvalue in assignment" on
line 572. This line is trying to assign a value to isa_dma_bridge_buggy,
which is defined in include/asm/dma.h as extern int if PCI is configured,
but as a symbolic constant if is not.
My suggestion would be to wrap the offending line in soundcard.c with an
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI, but I'm not sure if that's a fix or a workaround botch.
