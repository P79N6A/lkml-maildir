Addressing only this specific issue, and not the larger $thread issue...
Depends on what driver and version you are using.  It is preferred these 
days to force the media using ethtool.  But that said, if a NIC driver 
allows you to force in 2.4 and not in 2.5, that definitely sounds like 
an eth driver bug.
