I was used to mount devfs in a separate folder, to search for a ZISO file on 
hard drives or DVD/CD units in my boot ram rescue disks, and Gentoo live DVD, 
in last kernel versions devfs still there but not anymore in config, we still 
able to use it, touching some files.
Just to know ¿How many releases will still there?
How do you a search for drives with hald/dbus at boot time on a ramdisk it is 
not more complex?!?!?!.
Well, I still wanting for a while devfs, untill I use to use hald/dbus :(
