Is there something wrong with making the Atapi cdrom driver as module and 
then loading that with an ignore hdX then loading the ide-scsi module?  That 
doesn't seem hard at all.  just two pretty lines in /etc/modules.  Just make 
both drivers modular.   otherwise you have people needing to do boot 
arguments through lilo.  
and andre had a patch at one time that was supposed to do something like 
allow you to use the recording function of ide CDR's without the scsi layer.  
Not sure if it was complete or even really working but i tried it once.  
Maybe you can ask him if it's possible.
