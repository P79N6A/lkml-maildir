I have couple more fixes to the firmware loader class:
firmware-pin_module.patch:
  - we need to pin the firmware module if we successfully registered firmware
    class device and "put" it in device re4lease function otherwise the
    module could be unloaded too early. Consider:
    - some module requests firmware
    - firmware loader registers class device and calls hotplug
    - userspace hangs keeping 
    - firmware loader times out
    - the calls module is unloaded. Now firmware loader has 0 refcount and
      cazn be unloaded as well leaving device class behind.
    Am I seeing things?
firmware-hotplug.patch
  - I stll think that we sould not call userspace until we registered all
    necessary attributes. Now that Greg put my changes to kobject in mainline
    ist very easy -  just inhibit hotplug handler until we are ready and call
    kobject_hitplug by ourselves.
Please comment.
