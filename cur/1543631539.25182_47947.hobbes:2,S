A recent discussion on the ARM mailing lists has highlighted that hardware
designers seem to like connecting such things like LCD panels up to devices
in weird and wonderful ways - sometimes with a set of 4 pixels reversed,
sometimes with even weirder connectivity.  I've pointed them at the
framebuffer dev list.
Certainly your fbcon-cfb4 changes will break at least one of my machines
here.
Please talk this over with the framebuffer dev list.
