Agreed.  This is something that has been talked about but not implemented
for a long time now.  Thanks for the efforts.

I might disagree here.  One of the reasons for having the reserved blocks
is to prevent fragmentation, and not necessarily to reserve space for root.
For the lots of small files cases it makes more sense to leave free space
in each group to prevent fragmentation at the group level.
For the large file case, there is less need to worry about fragmentation,
so we can just ignore the group's reserved percentage for "large" files.
A heuristic which says "if this file is huge, just keep allocating from this
group, and screw the reserved blocks" makes sense.
One such heuristic is if the file is, say, larger than 1/2 or 1/4 of the
entire group in size, it is allowed to continue allocating from the same
group.
We could also say that for the purpose of allocating new files in a directory,
anything more than 95% full is "full" and the inode should be allocated in
a different group regardless of where the parent is.  It may be that the
Orlov allocator already has such a heuristic, but I think that is a different
discussion.
Cheers, Andreas
