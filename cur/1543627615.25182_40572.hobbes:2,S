A different clock goes to the timer chip. It is always:
	CLOCK_TICK_RATE 1193180 Hz
unless an Elan SC-520 at which time the frequency is:
	CLOCK_TICK_RATE 1189200 Hz 
(from ../include/asm/timex.h)

It doesn't/can't change scheduling behavior. It changes only the rate
at which a CPU bound task will get the CPU taken away. It also changes
the rate it which it gets it back, in a 1:1 ratio, with a net effect
of nothing-gained/nothing-lost except for preemption overhead.

The reference to HZ seems to be correct in all the headers so changing
it is trivial.
