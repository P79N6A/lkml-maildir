Well, yes there has to be a distinction between a true bind mount which
actually covers the file or directory, and something like the stream
"bind mount" which doesn't.
The stream "bind mount" is just there to allow you to root the
attributes in a single tree. It can be made functionally entirely
equivalent to the openat(), but uses pathname semantics (e.g., "//") to
denote the attribute fork instead of an extra function call.

Don't you end up having to lock the entire paths b/c/d and a/e/f in
order to prevent "ln a b/c/d/a; ln b a/e/f/b"?

As I said, NFSv4 can be made ready pretty quickly: Bruce is already
finishing up the xattr implementation.

NTFS? ;-)
