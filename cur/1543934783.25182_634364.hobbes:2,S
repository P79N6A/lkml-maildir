It is great to have all the obvious style issues fixed no matter how much
the code clarity and logic is improved. For the simple reason that with
obvious coding style issues fixed you do not get distracted.
And I do not understand why people has any problem with that when we talk
about patches.
What is then considered "obvious style issues" are today implemented
as errors / warnings in checkpatch for the most part. Not everyone
agrees with what checkpatch says are errors/warnings but this is at
least an more or less unambigious way to express these obvious cases.
And this is far better than the maintainers choice of the day style.

Things turn red in my vi if no-one cares - and I have no magic tool
to fix it here.
No-one should submit patches with white-space errors - thank you.
