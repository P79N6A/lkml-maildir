Looking at the page allocator "fastpath": The basic reaons that this was 
such a good optimization was that the page allocator is expensive to call. 
The hotpath gets more and more clogged with logic. Fixing the page 
allocator to be more efficient may be the right approach here. That could 
also include having a list of zeroed pages.
Zeroed pages however will not address the issue of having initialized pgd 
(which seems to be what i386 needs).
