It's OK - I can reproduce it easily anyway.
There are two things here.  Recent -ac kernels had a merge
bug down in the /proc code which caused `Cached:' to go
negative.  It was recently fixed.
And quite independently, current ext3 for Linus kernels now has a
bug which causes the `buffermem_pages' number to get too large.
This has the exact same effect: `Cached:' goes negative. 
The buffermem_pages counter is purely for reporting - no VM decisions
are based on its value.  But if it worries you, just remove line 1933 of fs/jbd/transaction.c.
