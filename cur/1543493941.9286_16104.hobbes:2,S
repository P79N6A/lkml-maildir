The sed on my system, which is quite old, not from a standards
distribution, does, indeed do lseek to find the file-size. Your
version does 'fstat' which will accomplish the same thing. Typically
a program that does 'lseek(0, SEEK_CUR)` expects to have the correct 
return value or errno be set to ESPIPE which lets it know that it's
a pipe, socket, or fifo. This lets it work with such. 
In any event, the files in /proc can't be read with `less` either
for the same reason, also `more` always shows 0%. It's the expected
nature,
Cheers,
