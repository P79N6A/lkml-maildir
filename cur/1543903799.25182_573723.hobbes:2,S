I'm feeling slow, and think I'm missing something. Why is this an
issue? Wouldn't userspace just keep track of the last overrun count,
and subtract the two to get the overruns-since-last-read? That makes
it oblivious to rollovers, unless it can't manage to do a read once
every 11 hours.
(This is the same sort of thing we already have to deal with in
certain situations, such as network stat counters on 32 bit
platforms.)
