1) Unlinking is not deleting, it may just trigger deleting. !Unix people 
   don't get it.
   If you like non-owners to have no unlink permission, you have to set 
   the sticky bit. If you want other users not to be able to delete files
   you put into a public directory, put a link into that directory and 
   keep one in a private directory.
2) If you're accounted for the space occupied by your directories, you 
   need the permission to remove the directory. Otherwise you could DoS 
   other users if you have write permission in one of his directories.
