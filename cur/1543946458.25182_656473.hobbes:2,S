The Coverity checker spotted the following inconsequent NULL checking 
introduced by commit 8ff12cfc009a2a38d87fa7058226fe197bb2696f:
<--  snip  -->
...
static inline int is_end(void *addr)
{
        return (unsigned long)addr & PAGE_MAPPING_ANON;
}
...
static void deactivate_slab(struct kmem_cache *s, struct kmem_cache_cpu *c)
{
...
        if (c->freelist)    <----------------------------------------
                stat(c, DEACTIVATE_REMOTE_FREES);
        /*
         * Merge cpu freelist into freelist. Typically we get here
         * because both freelists are empty. So this is unlikely
         * to occur.
         *
         * We need to use _is_end here because deactivate slab may
         * be called for a debug slab. Then c->freelist may contain
         * a dummy pointer.
         */
        while (unlikely(!is_end(c->freelist))) {
                void **object;
                tail = 0;       /* Hot objects. Put the slab first */
                /* Retrieve object from cpu_freelist */
                object = c->freelist;
                c->freelist = c->freelist[c->offset];
...                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
