Hi!
  This is very critical bug fix. This bug was causing the problem with 
people builing more than one driver with vesa and they where getting blank 
screens. The reason was befor ethe api change each driver was loaded and 
set as the default driver. Then you ended up with the last driver being 
the default driver. Now this is the not the case so this patch makes the
first driver the default driver.
[FBCON] Fixed the order of which driver is used for the console. Before 
the api change the last driver loaded became the default one. Now this is 
not the case.
