I don't think ENTRY should be used for nested procedures. If the
author wants to do something like that, he better knew something
about the assembler anyhow.

Currently there is many different patterns. Some functions use ENTRY
without END, some use ENTRY/ENDPROC, some use ENDPROC without annotation
at the start...

ENTRY/END alone is not enough if one wants to be able to distinguish
between code (functions) and non-executed data.

Agreed. I vote to complement the existing ENDPROC annotation with
the proposed PROC annotation. Let's call that an extension, not
something new ;). As it stands it is not impossible to go with
ENTRY/ENDPROC for code and ENTRY/END for data. However, ENTRY
implies alignment and the prefered alignment for code and data
might differ.
