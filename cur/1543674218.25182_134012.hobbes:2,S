Alan,
the patch applied cleanly and worked for me
(prevented global suspension). Having the lengthy
waits outside of the ISR is a definate plus, and
the debounce makes sense.
My machine does not have APM/ACPI facilities so
I can't test the suspend. It is getting pretty
dated, but the economy dictates I live with it for
a while longer :-)
Does you laptop use the PIIX4? If it does and uses only
one port, I would be very interested to see if
one port is continuously reporting OC (hardwired).
Thanks for the patch,
Paul
