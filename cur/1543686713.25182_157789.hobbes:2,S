That's the answer to a different question.
The unanswered question is: what should madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) do,
given dirty pages?
man madvise(*) says that it zero-fills anonymous private mappings, and
restores private file-backed mappings to the original file pages.
That is not surprising, as the CPU-friendly semantic is more
complicated to implement, needing an extra flag in the page table
(or rmap structure).
