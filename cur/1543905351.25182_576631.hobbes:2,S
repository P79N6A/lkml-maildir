To be concrete: In the Installation Manual for the rx6600 (P/N AB464-9001A), 
figure 1-1 ("I/O Subsystem Block Diagram") the names being used are "PCIx-66", 
"PCIx-133", and "PCIx267". However in the text following the text refers to "66 
MHz PCI/PCI-X slots" ("PCI/PCI-X 133 MHz", "PCI/PCI-X 266 MHz").
The Qlogic data sheet for the "ISP2422" also calls the bus interface "64-bit, PCI-
X 2.0 266-MHz DDR", and the document's subtitle is "Dual Port 4-Gbps Fibre Channel 
(FC) to PCI-X 2.0 266-MHz Controller".
Confusing?
