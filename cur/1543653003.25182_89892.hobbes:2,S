thats fine if there is an all-compiling kernel release out there.  right
now 2.5-bk is far from it.  last i checked allmodconfig (a couple of
days ago) there was major breakage all over llc, scsi, video, sound, ...
which kinda masks any breakages you might have introduced.  these sort
of things get fixed in time, but they are often replaced by new ones in
other places
