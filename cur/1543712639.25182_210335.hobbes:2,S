shrink_dcache_parent() will only free up the zero ref. counted dentries,
positive or negatvie doesnot matter. But we may have some faulty user space
app holding a sysfs file, sysfs directory, corresponding kobject, module etc.

(Greg, I am including the reply for other thread also here)

Fix for these problems will depend upon the life time rule for
modules Vs kobjects Vs dentries. When and what should die or live?
I am not very clear about how the first two behave. Still I can think
of a solution within sysfs like this as Alen suggested. But again I am not 
very sure if this can be done properly without any races. But anyway I am 
trying.
1) backout my patch sysfs-pin-kobject.patch
2) handle NULL d_fsdata while trying to access the corresponding kobject
   for an attribute file.
