Then what would be the correct way to handle resume process. The other
way of course is to make all the applications check the errno in case of
failure. But that seems more more problematic then system call checking.
What do you say?
BTW can you point me to code where socket read checks for
signal_pending(current)?

It's of similar kind: the system call checks signal_pending(current) and
exit
with an error if that's true.
Well, I'm afraid we can't place try_to_freeze() in every system call
that
does something like that ...
