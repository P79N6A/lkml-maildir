I don't think NTFS is related, I just wanted people to know what kernel I'm 
using.

I tried four times to post a reply to lkml, never seen my own posts.
This is becoming a problem, need to debug email route to lkml :-)
I needed storage badly and had to delete problematic files before 
trying new NTFS driver, sorry. :-( Now I'm running 2.5.7 with new driver,
seems to work fine. Well done! I'll report anything unusual.
Are there any plans for RW support for NTFS?
