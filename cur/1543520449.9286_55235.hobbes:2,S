Today, Vojtech Pavlik, spilled the beans:

Vojtech: see my other post if you still can titled: "warp speed still not
good", there were some extra tidbits of information provided in there.
The problem with that theory is that older kernels, say 2.3.26 don't give
me this problem... the system time is always correct and even if i keep
running hwclock i see no big deviation in system and hardware time.
most programs work correctly, however some that i have noticed: netscape
(javascript), lftp (download time stats), XFree (Screen Blanking) operate
far too quickly (weeks in minutes).  I have tried this with both 2.3.33
and 2.3.29 and have found them both too give the problems..
I have noticed also, that the start of the problem is seemingly sparatic.
I can boot the system up now and not get any indications of time moving
too quickly,  but once a certain program or event is triggered it
begins.  last time it was a screen blank; i moved my mouse too wake it
up and it started.  funny thing is, it had been blank all night with no
problems, not even when i woke it up that morning.
Currently I am still running 2.3.33 which I have seen the problem with
before.  I have been up for 1 day 1:28, and the event has seemingly not
been triggered (although my computer usage has been minimal)... prior to
my rebooting however, the system was playing the time game.
Have there been any major time changes recently?
