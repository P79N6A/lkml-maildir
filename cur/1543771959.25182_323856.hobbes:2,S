This also affects gitk, which takes the first line of the commit
message as the headline.  I could make gitk take the first paragraph
(i.e. until the first blank line) as the headline but even that
wouldn't help since you put a blank line between the "Automatic merge"
line and the actual URL.  Could you leave out that blank line in
future, or do you have a better suggestion?
Paul.
