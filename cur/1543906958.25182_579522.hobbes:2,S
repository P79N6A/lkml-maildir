on the journalling side this would be one transaction (not 5 milion)
and... since inodes are grouped on disk, you can even get some better
coalescing this way... 
Wonder if we could do inode-grouping smartly; eg if we HAVE to write
inode X, also write out the atime-dirty inodes in range X-Y to X+Y
(where Y is some tunable) in the same IO..
