Yes, I also use CFQ. Didn't dare to try with the anticipatory scheduler.
Since Andrew was so sceptical, I tested a bit more, and it's not as easily 
reproducible as I wrote. There don't seem to be any problems on a freshly 
booted system. It only happens after using the system for some time. But I 
think that's only natural as the virtal->physical mapping needs to be 
disturbed before seeing any problems.
