Because it has almost no proper framework to speak of and what little there 
is has been pretty much unchanged since the very beginning.
I'm trying to develop a decent framework that should help support upcoming 
devices and generally make life easier for v4l driver developers.
And I've no idea why we don't just use the device's release() callback for 
this. I'm going to implement this right now :-)
