Subject: BOOTP not working in 2.2.18?

In the file net/ipv4/ipconfig.c is a variable called ic_enabled which is
initialised to zero and never set anywhere. a check is made and bootp
isn't run if its not set. Setting it to 1 before the check makes it appear
to work.
[ The user-space bootpc doesn't want to play ball at all these days.. :-( ]
