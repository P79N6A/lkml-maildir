Ah, that's not such good behaviour anyway. mmap is allowed to map
outside the file offset, so you're telling me that remap_file_pages
just magically should not be allowed to remap these...?

I don't think there is anything preventing truncate races here. Theoretically
we could do it by taking i_mutex around here, but anyway then a subsequent
truncate is just going to be able to cause the mapping to be out of bounds
anyway.
If it were any other syscall than remap_file_pages, I'd be much more
hesitant to say this: I propose we change the test case instead. I
also changed other elements of the API, and we had the result tested
and verified by Oracle...
