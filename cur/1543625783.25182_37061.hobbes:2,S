Oh, I wasn't talking about this part of the code at all. That's
actually broken in other ways as well (see the other thread where I
replied to Carsten Otte).
I'm just talking about the devfs_alloc_unique_number() implementation,
which *also* was using an array of __u32. That's where you cast doubt
upon the memset/memcpy, a few emails ago. Apart from the missing cast
to void *, I assert that devfs_alloc_unique_number() is 100% correct.
The type of the bitfield should be changed, of course, for cleanliness
reasons, but it isn't actually a bug.
Clear now? Or should I just telephone you for a few minutes rather
than go back and forth in a dozen more emails? :-)
