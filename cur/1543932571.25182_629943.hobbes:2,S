Right, I meant to say SYN+ACK.  I don't see them coming back.

I can take these captures and take a look at the results.
Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to make the captures
available to the general public.

Unfortunately, I think that will be the answer if I can't get any help
fixing this problem in the kernel.  It's a bummer, because many of the
remote hosts my application communicates with are on wireless links,
so there may be performance implications to turning SACK off.
