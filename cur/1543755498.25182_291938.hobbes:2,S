And you get in the habit of using 0 instead of NULL and before you know
it you've used it in a variable argument list for a GTK library call on
an AMD64 system and corrupted the stack. :-)
(The compiler can't convert 0 to a pointer if it doesn't know that it's
supposed to be one.  Variable argument lists are evil that way.)
