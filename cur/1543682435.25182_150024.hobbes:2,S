This is a message I posted to the Dreamcast linux development list. It appears 
to be a problem with the cross assembler (target is SH4, host is ia32) I am 
using but before I put it down to that, I wonder if anybody else has seen 
this and can offer a comment?
It is certainly not a configuration problem as the SH4 maintainer has built 
this kernel for the Dreamcast (he's probably the only one apart from me to 
have even tried :() and when I used his .config it failed in just the same 
way.
Thanks
Adrian

Getting this - is this a configuration problem? (Though it seems to occur
whether initrd support is on or off). I'm just using the gcc 3.0.4 I use to
build 2.4 series kernels with.
echo "  .section .init.ramfs,\"a\"" > usr/initramfs_data.S
echo ".incbin \"usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz\"" >> usr/initramfs_data.S
  AS      usr/initramfs_data.o
usr/initramfs_data.S: Assembler messages:
usr/initramfs_data.S:2: Error: Unknown pseudo-op:  `.incbin'
make[2]: *** [usr/initramfs_data.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [usr] Error 2
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 2
