Umhm... Remember the fun with rm /tmp/12345.s; cp my_code.s /tmp/12345.s;
laugh watching as the sucker goes on with compile ending up with a troyan,
don't you?

That is, you've done audit of pine, lpc, screen, wall, write, mail, xterm,
etc. installed SGID-root, right? Would you mind sharing it? Ditto for
suid-root man, if you please. Ditto for the method of storing s[u|g]id in
the first place (doable, but you'll have to screw around with the
attributes).
Hey, wait-a-bloody-minute... What about the ownership of $HOME? OK, you
can mount it with uid=... Ouch. Speak about the binary security model...

BTW, do you realize that 2.0.28 is very likely to have racey FAT? The fix
I did for 2.2 will not fly - it seriously depends on dcache, so you'll
have to roll your own. And I don't envy you - it's a messy work. Really. I
will not volunteer for _that_. Even with dcache it was PITA.
