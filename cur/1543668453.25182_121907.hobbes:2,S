i've seen suspicious behaviour since installing the ptrace patch as
well, but i couldn't really narrow it down to anything, as i have
absolutely nothing of interest in logs.  i just login during the day
and notice that it had rebooted itself (uncleanly) over night at
around 3-5am.  this is when the disk-intensive nightly stuff happens,
like some backups, updatedb, etc.
i was starting to suspect power issues, since i never see oopses in
logs.
this is a dual athlon box.
