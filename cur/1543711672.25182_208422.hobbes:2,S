Hello's in broadcast network are multicast. Problem is solved now for 
me, btw. It appears to be bug in e100 driver in 2.4.x.
I can't reproduce it any more with e100 development driver (from 
http://sf.net/projects/e1000/
). And I can't it reproduce it with 
forcing network to non-broadcast either (in this case unicast hello's 
are sent).
So it's multicast problem with e100 2.x driver.
