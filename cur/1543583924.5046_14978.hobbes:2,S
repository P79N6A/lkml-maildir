Hrm - make it part of the "fscking_moron" subsystem.
/proc/sys/kernel/fscking_moron/stupidity_workarounds/cant_handle_ascii/broken_shellscript_hack
It would be nice if the shell's error message gave a bit more information
on the problem, but that's a userspace issue IMHO: make *sh check for this
kind of mistake and say "interpreter for shell script not found",
something like that. Whatever, it's NOT a kernel issue.
Maybe the kernel could return a different error value, though - just
saying "file not found" isn't very helpful...
James.
