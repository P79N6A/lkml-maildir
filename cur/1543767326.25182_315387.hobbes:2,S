Making a wild guess.
What if some filesystem allowed access to vfsmount in other namespace?
Just like the proc filesystem having the ability to do so, but
marginally stops it through the check in proc_check_root().
However the check you mentioned above where-a-bind-mount-across-
namespace is allowed, implies that there is some legal way of getting
access to vfsmounts in other namespace.  Or maybe a remote possibility
that its a bug?
