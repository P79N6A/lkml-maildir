	I have not been able to test the issue with part of PCI bus
missing from the lspci output on HP DL-585 quad opteron (the server is
in production use, I cannot reboot it just now), however the two other
problems (IRQ timeout on IDE controller and no IRQs on tg3 NIC) seem
to be fixed on 2.6.14-rc2.
	I will probably test the 2.6.14-rc2 on HP DL-585 tomorrow evening.
Thanks,
