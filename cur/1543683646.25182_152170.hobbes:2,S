Ach. One bug fixed and the Linux kernel is still not perfect?
What a pity.
[But yes, as I also said to someone else: on i386 one has a working
keyboard after bootup. No initialization and no probing required.
The new keyboard code uses a lot of knowledge about common keyboards
and keyboard controllers. It works in most cases. But already the
linux-kernel readers see a long stream of problems. I am afraid of
the effect on a million Linux users.]
[[On the other hand, as I wrote somewhere else, this is a great way
to learn a lot about very obscure keyboards.]]
