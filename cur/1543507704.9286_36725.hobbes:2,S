    Why not?  I'd say that the contents of /proc/cpuinfo would be very
    interesting to tools, because it's what the operating system thinks
    it's running on.
    As much as I hate to say it, this is probably a case where backward
    compatability could be overlooked;  enough of the tools that do use
    /proc are already very fragile and blow up every time the kernel
    goes up a major version to make it seem a good idea to blow up the
    published interface and replace it with a consistant interface
    across platforms.
