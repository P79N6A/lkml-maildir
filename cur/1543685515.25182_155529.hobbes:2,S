Hi Roman,
I observed a problem with the following Kconfig snippet I tried to add
to 2.6.0-test2-mm5:
config BLK_DEV_PS2
        tristate "PS/2 ESDI hard disk support" if BROKEN_MODULAR
        bool "PS/2 ESDI hard disk support" if !BROKEN_MODULAR
Every "make *config" gives the warning
  drivers/block/Kconfig:45: prompt redefined
  drivers/block/Kconfig:45:warning: type of 'BLK_DEV_PS2' redefined from 
  'tristate' to 'boolean'
and the symbol is handled as tristate although BROKEN_MODULAR isn't
defined.
cu
Adrian
