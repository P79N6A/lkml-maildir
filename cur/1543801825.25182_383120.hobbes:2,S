I am confused.
There is
http://softmac.sipsolutions.net/softmac-snapshot.tar.bz2
at 
http://softmac.sipsolutions.net/SoftMAC,
page also says "Projects using this layer: * Broadcom 43xx driver"
but Broadcom driver page at 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/bcm43xx/snapshots/softmac/
has 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/bcm43xx/snapshots/softmac/ieee80211softmac-20060107.tar.bz2
which is not the same. For example, ieee80211softmac.h file exists in both
tarballs but is not identical.
Suppose one wants to use softmac in a project. What tarball contains
the bleeding edge of softmac?
