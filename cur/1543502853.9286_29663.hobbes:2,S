What does it mean to say
	.section .mysection, "ax"
specifically, what does the "ax" denote (allocate/executable??)
Under gcc 2.7.2.3, mysection gets aligned to 4 bytes, whereas
on egcs-1.1.2-12, it gets aligned to 16 bytes on an ia32. My
code needs to know the alignment, so when I assumed 4 byte
alignment, my code compiled on gcc works, but not on egcs.
I am trying to figure out if my assumption is wrong, or one of
gcc or egcs is wrong. Please CC all answers to kanoj@engr.sgi.com.
Thanks.
