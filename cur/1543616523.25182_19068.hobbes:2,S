Doug do you still have the i810 audio version 0.18
Also v0.19 has unresolved symbols :
./i810_audio.o: unresolved symbol __global_cli
./i810_audio.o: unresolved symbol kernel_flag
./i810_audio.o: unresolved symbol synchronize_irq
./i810_audio.o: unresolved symbol __global_save_flags
./i810_audio.o: unresolved symbol __global_restore_flags
i686 566 Celeron kernel 2.4.17 
If you do will you send me v0.18 so that I may have sound again thank you.
(I lost it so that is why I'm asking)
