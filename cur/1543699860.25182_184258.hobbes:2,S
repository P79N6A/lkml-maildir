You need to update your hotplug installation.  Turn on debugging in your 
hotplug scripts and copy the appropriate object ID numbers into the 
usb.usermap file.

Try recreating your swapon partition/file?  Turning on a gig of swap

Update/rebuild your rpc/nfs tools.

I haven't used zsh or cdrdao so I can't comment on them.   I don't use 
the above modules, but all the other modules on my system (numerous) do 
autoload just fine.  NFS is a big PITA for me for other reasons but the 
services do start.
My systems are of the Gentoo flavor.
