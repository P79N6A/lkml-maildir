The big sticking point here is order-sensitivity. One can point to
stringent sched_yield() ordering but that's not so important in and of
itself. The more significant case is RT applications which are order-
sensitive. Per-cpu runqueues rather significantly disturb the ordering
requirements of applications that care about it.
In terms of a plugging framework, the per-cpu arrangement precludes or
makes extremely awkward scheduling policies that don't have per-cpu
runqueues, for instance, the 2.4.x policy. There is also the alternate
SMP scalability strategy of a lockless scheduler with a single global
queue, which is more performance-oriented.
