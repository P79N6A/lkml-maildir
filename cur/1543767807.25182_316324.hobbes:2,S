I need to take a close look at this again, but I think this special
handling for the RMO region in unnecessary.  I added it in the 'early
days of SPARSE' when there were some 'bootstrap' issues and we needed
to initialize some memory before setting up the bootmem bitmap.  I'm
pretty sure all those issues have gone away.
