I have the same problem. It started when I applied Gerd Knorr's V4L2
patches for bttv 0.8.x in 2.4.12. If I reverted back to the vanilla
2.4.12 kernel, all was fine.
This then became a problem in vanilla 2.4.13. It doesn't happen with all
apps, just apps that play small wav files (like "play"). Quake3 and xmms
don't have any issues.
I've tried the drivers on opensource.creative.com, but they haven't
helped. I'm now using the V4L2 patches for 2.4.13, and the problem is
still there.
Here's my driver info:
Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.16, 23:24:09 Nov  5 2001
PCI: Found IRQ 7 for device 00:0c.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 7 with 00:07.2
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 8 model 0x8027 found, IO at 0xe400-0xe41f, IRQ 7
ac97_codec: AC97  codec, id: 0x5452:0x4123 (TriTech TR?????)
Please CC any response to vi@sh.nu, as I'm not on the list.
Thanks,
