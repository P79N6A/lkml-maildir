A good start for making sure your HTML is likely to be correct (and display 
correctly) is to run it through a validator.  There are a number around: 
one I know of on the top of my head is:
		validator.w3.org
In the long term, XML with style sheets is likely the right way to go:
but browsers don't yet generally implement it (though they are working
on it.
There is currently a proposal in the IETF describing a DTD for their
documents.
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mrose-writing-rfcs-02.txt
You will note that the intent is to generate multiple formats on output:
plaintext, HTML, XML + style sheet, etc.  Something like this is the
right long term approach.
But I sure am not a fan of Info, and find the current state of Linux
documentation a true mess: on UNIX systems, at least man did something
useful all the time...  Of any single thing I find wrong with Linux,
arguably this mess is the biggest of them.
