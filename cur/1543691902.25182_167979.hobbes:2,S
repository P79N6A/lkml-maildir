get_unaligned_unlikely() is exactly what just loading the 32-bit value
as if it were aligned is, ie. what we're doing right now.
People who want top performance should not put a networking card into
their machine that can only DMA packets to 32-byte or whatever
boundaries.  That's exactly the limitation NS83820 has and therefore
why it should be avoided like the plague by performance conscious
folks.
