Yes, I'm going to contact upstream about this.
However, after closer look on cpufreq code I came to a conclusion that 
the lock there doesn't really play the role of a completion. There's 
always: down(), then do something with the data structure, then up() in 
the same function.
I'm going to fix it differently after consulting with upstream author (I 
now think that it should not be necessary to take the lock in 
cpufreq_add_dev at all).
