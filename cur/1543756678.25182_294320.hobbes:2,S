Subject: How to disable slow agpgart in kernel config?

Hello,
the agpgart backend is now always compiled in and selected with 2.6.11-rc3 
x86_64. I can delete or disable it in the config, it is always back written.
Is this the default future behaviour? The eg Nforce3 AGP is on a normal 
desktop so slow on 2D and also in 3D mode a lot slower and all nvidia 
kernel driver users can not more use the really faster nv_agp.
Greetings,
Marcus
