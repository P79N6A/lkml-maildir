The question is, byte_rev[*a] gets fetched before or after a is ++'ed?
As you may see from the length of this thread, one has to think
too much on this tiny piece of code and nevertheless can get it wrong.
Let's change code to be obvious:
*a = byte_rev[*a]; a++;
and noone will have to waste his/her time re-checking validity of it
(or worse, figuring out why kernel breaks with new GCC).
