Ok, this is the source.
In particular, I can re-create _exactly_ the linux-0.97 "errno.h" file by 
using the "sys_errlist[]" contents from "libc-2.2.2". In particular, this 
trivial loop will generate the exact (byte-for-byte) list that is in the 
kernel:
        int i;
        for (i = 1; i < 122; i++) {
                const char *name = names[i];
                int n = strlen(name);
                char *tabs = "\t\t"+(n > 7);
                const char *expl = libc222_errlist[i];
                printf("#define\t%s%s%2d\t/* %s */\n",
                        name, tabs, i, expl);
        }
here, the "names[]" array was filled in with the error names, ie
	const char *names[] = { "none",
	"EPERM", "ENOENT", "ESRCH", "EINTR", "EIO", "ENXIO", "E2BIG",
	...
and the "libc222_errlist[]" array was filled in with the strings found by 
just downloading the old "libc-2.2.2" binary that can still be found at
	
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/oldlibs/libc-2.2.2/
and then just doing a "strings - libc-2.2.2" and "sys_errlist[]" will be 
obvious:
	static char *libc222_errlist[] = {
	        "Unknown error",
	        "Operation not permitted",
	...
This was literally a five-minute hack (I wrote the silly loop yesterday to
see what it does with the current "strerror()" - there is very good
correlation even today, but using the libc-2.2.2 sys_nerrlist[] you get
_exactly_ the same result).
So this is definitely the source of the kernel error header. It's either a
file from the libc sources, or it is literally auto-generated like the
above (I actually suspect the latter - now that I did the auto-generation
it all felt very familiar, but that may just be my brain rationalizing
things. Humans are good at rationalizing reality.).
Can anybody find the actual libc _sources_? Not the kernel headers that
hjl mentions (those are the old ones from _before_ the change), but the
file "libc-2.2.2.tar.Z"?
Anyway, we know where the kernel header comes from. Let's figure out where 
the libc data comes from.
