You may have patched a kernel source with Mark's patch, but you are
very clearly not running a kernel build from that patched source.
As can be seen from (for example) this bit from Mark's patch
 translate_done:
-       printk(KERN_ERR "ata%u: translated ATA stat/err 0x%02x/%02x to "
-              "SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x%x/%02x/%02x\n", id, drv_stat, drv_err,
+       printk(KERN_ERR "ata%u: translated op=0x%02x ATA stat/err
0x%02x/%02x to "
+              "SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x%x/%02x/%02x\n", id, opcode,
drv_stat, drv_err,
              *sk, *asc, *ascq);
the patch changes the text being printed. In this case the text
"ata%u: translated ATA stat/err ..." is changed into "ata%u:
translated ATA stat/err ..."
And if we look at the output you posted :

That string is clearly from an un-patched kernel as Mark also pointed
out in his reply to you.
