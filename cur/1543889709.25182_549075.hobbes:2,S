The whole thing would be much simpler if
- cpu up callbacks had a way to request executing on the target CPU
[i looked at this, but it was a little more involved than a simple
cleanup]
- smp_call_function_single had sane semantics regarding calling
the same CPU similar to on_each_cpu()
- C had anonymous lambda functions with nice syntax (ok one can dream) 
But right now so many callbacks are needed that I ran out of good
names.
