As others have noted, SATA is young and should not be used for hot-swap, 
at least in a production manner. I suggest the IBM ServeRAID controller 
as one solution for SCSI. I have a bunch of servers in various places 
around the country, and these have been good to me, work pretty well 
with typical failures, and IBM supports them.
I've deployed about 35 of these and am still happy, so you have a data 
point. Most of my servers have 3-6TB.
