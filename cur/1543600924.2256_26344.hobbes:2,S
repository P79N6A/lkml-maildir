Nothing is needed but without changes we would prefer not to include the
rcu patch in the kernel. AFIK (and I'm far from being an expert here) I
can upload the source protected by patent to kernel.org and everybody
but US citizens can safely run the code protected by patent without
having to pay the patent holder. So in short the problem is that it
wouldn't be nice if you could download freely the linux kernel but you
couldn't use it freely in the US without first dropping the rcu patch.
In short AFIK from your part you should just make a modification to the
patent (or whatever else legal paperwork) saying that the usage of the
rcu technology in GPL code is allowed free of charge.
