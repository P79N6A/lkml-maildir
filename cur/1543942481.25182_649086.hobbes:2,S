No. Please note we're talking about ISAPnP, not PnPBIOS. No BIOS involved at 
all.
Driver (sound/isa/cs423x/cs4236.c) furthermore does not use anything but the 
PnP layer itself. Start at snd_cs423x_pnpc_detect, which is the pnp .probe() 
method.
I'll look into providing a more extensive answer and/or test whatever comes 
in later.
Rene.
