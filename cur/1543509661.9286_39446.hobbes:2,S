Oops, silly me. I replied too quick. Nowhere does it say the 100K connections
would be outgoing. If its a server it only requires one port for 100K
incoming connections. In fact, even if these are 100K outgoing connections
you can still use just one port, providing they all go to different ports
somewhere else - it just isn't common practice to do so. Only the combination
of source IP, source port, destination IP and destination port must be
unique.
