Yep. We did some testing and found that if the server has a RW replica
of the partition your user ID exists in then the NDS login will work.
Otherwise nothing works. Also if you have password restrictions such as
minumum number of characters then most users must have a password that is
exactly the minimum number of characters unless they have admin
(supervisor) priviledges. Has us baffled.
We ended up making sure that the servers we use have RW replicas and that
we use full context NDS logins.
