Ahh now I see:
Parity Count:
        'pci_parity_count'
        This attribute file will display the number of parity errors that
        have been detected.
but this is zero ...
So would that mean that I don't have any parity errors?
btw: I'm still always getting diff errors at different files...
Chris.
