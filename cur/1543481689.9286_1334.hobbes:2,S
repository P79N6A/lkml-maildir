    ... All that is happening is that the partition index table is being
    converted from the newer     FAT32B to the older FAT32 tables which
    Linux has no problems reading. I also found out that as long as the
    drive is not over the FAT16 limit you can use linux's FDISK to change
    the drive type to Win95 FAT32. Linux FDISK wil report it as FAT32+ (if
    I remember right) but when you change the partition type to "Win 95
    FAT32" it works no problems as well. AS LONG AS the drive is UNDER the
    FAT16 max size even though it's FAT32. (Don't know why unless the
    linux fdisk is using FAT16 as an intermediate holding ground while
    converting the tables.)
I can assure you that there is no version of Linux fdisk
that does anything like what you describe.
(Maybe you write `fdisk' and mean `Partition Magic' or so?)
You can change the type of a partition into anything you like,
say to 42. However, that does not mean that the contents of
the partition are changed - it is just precisely this one
single byte that gets a different value.
