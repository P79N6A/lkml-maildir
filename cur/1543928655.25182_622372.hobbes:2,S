Weird, it looks like I can't boot with 2.6.23.9 because of some issues with
dm-crypt (my root filesystem is encrypted). I double-checked the
configuration (which I just took from my current one), well, no way. Any
other test I can do?
In the meanwhile, I noted another thing: sometimes it happens that I become
root and the jiffies counter jumps ahead. Then, when I close any root
session, the jiffies counter jumps back to the correct value.
Please remember that this isn't just an aesthetic issue, as some drivers
(e.g. b43 and b43legacy, but I guess a lot more) rely on jiffies. Do I need
to file a bug to bugzilla.kernel.org? Thank you.
