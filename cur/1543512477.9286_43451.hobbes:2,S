Well, as we noticed before, we can export a 12/20 split over NFS v2 (I
believe this is not an issue over NFS v3 or higher.)  However, if we
go to a 64-bit type now -- at least for the kernel-user space
interface -- we greatly reduce the risk of backing ourselves into a
corner that we have to deal with later.
However, I believe Andries already has kdev_t-as-a-pointer working,
and in fact has a bunch of nice properties, which IMO means we might
as well go 32/32 already now (with 12/20 for NFS v2 only.)
