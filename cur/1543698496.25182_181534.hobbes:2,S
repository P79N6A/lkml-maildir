There are a couple of things here.  First, the preempt count includes other 
reasons not to preempt.  One of these is used when working with per-cpu data and 
a cpu switch would NOT be good (a pointer would point to the wrong cpu's data). 
  Also, at one time, the bh-lock was also cause to bump the preempt count.  In 
2.6, I think that is no longer true, BUT, the bh-count is in the same word. 
This is important as we want to test just one thing at interrupt return time to 
see if it is ok to preempt.  (Well, we actually have to test the need_resched 
flag too...)  From the interrupt codes point of view, the fact that the current 
task holds one or more spin locks is ONLY visible via the preempt count.  Thus 
the count collects all these things in one, easy to check, place.  This allows 
us to keep the interrupt path as fast as possible.
