Subject: 2.3.14-1 nfs problems: used rqst slot ... on free list!

Hello,
Well, something is off with nfs on my box: the following was found in the
system's log this morning, along with it spewing debug info for every nfs
transaction that occurred.  Of course, since this machine uses nfsroot,
that meant more logging occurred =)  The machine should've been idle at
the time except for cron which ran find at 1am.  The machine is a dual
MMX running smp, an eepro100, an rtl8029 and a promise ultra/66.
