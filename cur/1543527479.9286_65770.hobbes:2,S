I guess we basically pray that the bios gods don't put this data into kernel
code/data regions?  I can understand, I just want to be clear.
01009120 ?  If that is hex, it is just over the 16M limit.  If decimal, just
below 1M.  I'm mostly curious.
If smp_find_config were incorporated into the e820 setup code, it could
easily be marked as such.  If the page is read-once, it would probably be
better to mark it reserved when we are freeing pages and let the
smp_get_config() free it.
