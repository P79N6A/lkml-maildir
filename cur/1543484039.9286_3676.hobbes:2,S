My box isn't dual cpu but here's two problems I've had witrh the PII-350
on my Aopen MB:
1. The PII-350 suddenly becomes a PII-175 and linux decides it doesn't
   like my HD.
2. My PII-350 suddenly forgets where it put it's cache.
Each of these problems show up on boottime -of the machine- so I suspect
it's a BIOS bug in my case. Have you checked the stats given to you by
your BIOS about both your CPUs? For me it's definately not Linux that's
at fault.
