I had a small login script on my DOS machine which would set up a
SUBST drive U: to point to \USER\<foo> where <foo> was whatever the
user entered at the login prompt.  No password, since DOS didn't have
security anyway.  Then I set up all apps to keep their datafiles on
U:<something>.
ANVIN'S LAW: NO MACHINE AS BIG AS A DESKTOP COMPUTER IS TRULY SINGLE USER.
Worked fine until Windows came along and all apps started actively
encouraging people to *save their files into the program directory*!
AAARGH!
