Me sticks hand up and waves at teacher.
And what does 'Transconductance' have to do with this?
That may be the wrong terminology to apply here.
In vacuum tube (remember those?) specifications, this is the gain of
the tube, which AIR is stated as the change in plate current for a
one volt change in grid bias, and is normally stated in micromho's as
they are high voltage, low current devices, with the highest gain
tube that I'm aware of being the 7788.   Using the same measurement
technique applied to modern relatively highed power field effect
transistors where the currents can be many amperes, readings best
stated in mho's are fairly common today. A 'mho' of course, is the
reciprocal of an ohm.

Yup.
