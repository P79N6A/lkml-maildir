I DO NOT CARE!
It breaks hundreds of drivers. End of discussion.
You can do the free_irq() and request_irq() changes _without_ breaking 
hundreds of drivers by just doing one driver at a time. 
And if ACPI then restores the irq controller state, the drivers that 
_don't_ do this will _also_ continue to work.
Let me re-iterate: the ACPI changes provably BROKE REAL PEOPLES SETUPS. 
For absolutely _zero_ gain. Drivers that want to free and re-aquire an 
interrupt can do so _regardless_ of whether ACPI restores irq routings 
automatically or not.
And that's my argument. We don't do stupid things that break peoples 
existing setups in ways that nobody can debug.
