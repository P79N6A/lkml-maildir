If we pass NULL as the 2nd parameter for register_ioctl32_conversion(),
the mpt_ioctl() entry point is *not* called when running a 32 bit
application in x86_64 mode.
The problem comes down to a couple IOCTL structures in mptctl.h are having
pointers and longs, and are incompatible between 32bit and 64 bit mode.
The register conversion function copy the data to proper packing, and
doesn't require people in the field to have to recompile their applications.
EXPORT_SYMBOL(sys_ioctl) is already there in s390x, ppc64, and sparc64 for
generic kernels, and in Redhat/SuSE kernels they have
EXPORT_SYMBOL(sys_ioctl)
under x86_64.
