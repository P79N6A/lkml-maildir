Without seeing how the bio gets to show_bio it is hard to be certain,
but my guess would be that by the time show_bio tries to inspect the
bio, the IO request involving it has already completed and the bio has
been freed, so you are accessing freed memory.

If you feed this line into ksymoops you get:
Code;  0000000000000000 Before first symbol
   0:   8b 00                     mov    (%rax),%eaxC
...
so it is trying to dereference $rax.

Which contains 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b.
which is lots of copies of 'POISON_FREE' (defined in
include/linux/poison.h) which makes it really look like that memory
has already been freed.
