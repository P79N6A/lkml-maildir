Just a thought for a way to fix the "very early" timing needed to set up 
udelay to work in a way that works on all machines.  Perhaps we haven't 
exploited the BIOS enough:  The PC BIOS since the PC AT (286)  has 
always had a standard "countdown timer" way to delay for n microseconds, 
which as far as I know still works.   This can be used to measure the 
speed of a delay loop, without using ANY in/out instructions directly 
(the ones in the BIOS are presumably correctly delayed...).
So first thing in the boot sequence, one can calibrate a timing loop 
using this technique, and save the value to be used for all the "early" 
stuff.
Here's skeleton code from old ASM code I found lying around in my 
archives to use BIOS to measure how many unrolled short jumps can 
execute in 10 msec.  Note that it can run without knowing anything 
whatsoever about port timing.
haltbyte db 0
calibrate:
    les bx,haltbyte ; address of halt flag into es:bx
    mov ax,8300h
    sub cx,cx
    mov dx,10000 ; 10 msec. in cx:dx
    int 15h
    jc bad
    sub dx,dx
    sub cx,cx ; decrement counter in dx:cx
tloop:
    jmp short $+2 ; 10 short jmps
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    jmp short $+2
    test haltbyte
    loopz tloop
    jnz done
    dec dx
    jnz tloop
" overflowed 32 bits ... never happens, cancel BIOS event wait.
    mov ax,8301h
    int 15h
    jmp error
 
done:
    mov ax,cx
    negl
" here dx:ax contains 32 bit loop count corresponding to 10 msec.
    ret ; return 32-bit value
Doc on function 83h of int 15h should be available online.
