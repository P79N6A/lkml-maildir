Yes.

No. The alternative is to just make the ordering requirements 
for "atomic_dec_return()" and "atomic_xchg()" be absolute. Say that they 
have to be full memory barriers, and push the problem into the low-level
architecture.
I _think_ your patch is the right approach, because most architectures are 
likely to do their own fast-paths for mutexes, and as such the generic 
ones are more of a template for how to do it, and hopefilly aren't that 
performance critical.
