Right.  Networking is in the same boat ... unless they're using udev
or some other tool which renames network interfaces.  I'm not entirely
comfortable with the kernel forcing you to use some other tool in order
to maintain stable device names on a static setup.  Perhaps we need
either a CONFIG option or a boot option to decide whether to do parallel
pci probes.
I still think we need a method of renaming block devices, but haven't
looked into it in enough detail yet.
