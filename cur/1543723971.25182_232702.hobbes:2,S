Hi,
I would like to know if there are any difference
between I/O ports such as serial port, parallel port,
keyboard and ide from those ones used by network
interface, such as ssh, ftp, http and telnet. Both can
be accessed by check_region(), request_region() and
release_region() functions? If not, what functions can
be used to access those ports in kernel mode?
Thanks
