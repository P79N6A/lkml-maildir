No.  They were not.  Their first cuts of NT used an HPFS variant until 
NTFS could be completed.  The guy who wrote NTFS for MS was a consultant
for us for several years, and I got a very long briefing on the history
of NT file systems over the years.
I do not know which version was the cutover, but I do believe it was 
pre 3.X NT versions.
