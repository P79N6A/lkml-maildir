You are correct.  This is something that I have fixed a long time in my
tree but have not submitted a patch.  The fix is attached below, but is
extracted from among other changes so may have some offsets or other
minor context issues.  In addition to correctly handling unsupported
revisions, it also returns an error if you try to remount such a fs
as read-write so the user knows there was a problem.
If nobody sees any obvious errors, then please apply.
Cheers, Andreas
