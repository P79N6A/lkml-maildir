For the record, broadcast of all-zeroes is an old BSDism.  Also, not every
host will respond to a broadcast ping - in fact, if less did, smurfs would
be less of a problem.

I've never seen it do this.  I've seen it ARP for its own IP address(es) in
case it's already in use, though.  I've also seen NetBEUI (?) packet storms
caused by M$'s file sharing protocol.
