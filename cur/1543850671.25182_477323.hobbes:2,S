Hello !linux-kernel
Does anybody try to compile latest linux-kernel with -W 
-Wno-unused -Wno-sign-compare CFLAGS? There is a tons of 
warnings :(
Recent versions of grsecurity patches adds this flags to 
default. When I asked to grsec developers, why did they do 
that, they answered: to show, how messy linux code is...
Is there any objections about it?
