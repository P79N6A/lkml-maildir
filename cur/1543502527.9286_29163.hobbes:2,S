  Hi, all. Version 114 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.10. Highlights of this release:
- Added support for /dev/netlink
  Thanks to Dennis Hou <smilax@mindmeld.yi.org>
- Return EISDIR rather than EINVAL for read(2) on directories
- Ported to kernel 2.3.10
				Regards,
					Richard....
