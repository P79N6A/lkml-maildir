That's interesting.
I wonder if we should look at making pci_set_master()'s latency timer 
setting code be a bit smarter.
It (pcibios_set_master in arch/i386/pci/i386.c) current checks the 
latency timer value programmed by the BIOS.  If the BIOS did not 
initialize the value, then it is set to 64.  Otherwise, it is clamped to 
the maximum 255.
I wonder if your BIOS shouldn't increase that latency timer value...?
