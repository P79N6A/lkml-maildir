So is the problem that people aren't listening when you say "lets slow down" ?
Why would this change things for people who obviously ignore what you say ? :)
I'll bet you'll still get flooded with "lets see if Linus takes this despite
what he said in his last announcement" patches if we moved to this model.
The only thing that would make a difference afaics, would be you putting
your foot down and just ignoring such submissions ?
