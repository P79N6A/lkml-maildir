I'm now told that the resulting tree after all the commits is correct.
The problem is that all the files which were supposed to be deleted by
previous patches ended up actually being deleted by the final patch in
the series.
So the resulting tree is fine, it's just that the history is rather
broken.
I think a solution to this might be to use git-apply, but there's one
draw back - I currently have the facility to unpatch at a later date,
but git-apply doesn't support -R.  I'd have to fall back to the patch
+ git add + git rm + git commit method, but that's been shown to be
fundamentally broken.
