 I actually used the trick a few years ago when we had real terminal
servers making up a SLIP connection and they had a hardcoded maximum MTU
of 1006.  Then setting route MSS to 966 (i.e. MTU minus standard IP header
minus standard TCP header) used to cure the problems with TCP connections.
Most problems were actually seen when connecting to Solaris boxes within
our university network which had a broken PMTU implementation (almost
nobody heard of firewalls at that time).

 You would have to use "mss 536", actually.

 The documentation of `route' is wrong and should be fixed.
