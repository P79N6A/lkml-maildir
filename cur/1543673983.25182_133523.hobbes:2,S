It might not be that bad.  What will happen is that the controller will 
assert FGR and interrupt the host.  The driver will see the global RD, but 
will also see that it's present only on OC ports, so the driver will never 
leave the SUSPENDED state and will never write a 0 to FGR and EGSM.  Hence 
the controller will never become active -- the wakeup won't finish.
Of course, it's necessary to worry about what happens if one port is OC, 
so the controller is in this permanently-waking-up state, when a device is 
plugged into the other port.  I think this will re-assert global RD and 
generate another interrupt.  This time the driver will see that the RD is 
for real, so it will complete the wakeup sequence.
Neither of us can easily test that, because it requires one port to be 
broken and the other to be working.  But if everything else is okay, I 
think this will work too.
