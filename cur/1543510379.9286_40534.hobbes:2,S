: Hi All
: A couple of questions to kernel developers. Are there any plans to add
: Sagem Telsat Turbo card support? Are there any drivers available now?
A driver (kernel module) for 2.0.34 or 2.0.35 (according to them) is
available from 
http://www.ihug.com.au/satnet/drivers/index.html
No support for 2.2 afaik.
Satnet (ihug) say the Telsat card is no longer available but perhaps they
are just refering to their supplier,etc.
Cheers,
