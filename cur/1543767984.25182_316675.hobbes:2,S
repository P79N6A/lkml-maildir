Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have any effect:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
  184 user1    39  19  7220 5924  520 R 99.9  1.1 209:40.68 mi41
  266 user2    25   0  1760  480  420 R 50.5  0.1  86:36.31 xdipole1
  227 user3    25   0  155m  62m  640 R 49.5 12.3  95:07.89 b170-se.x
Note that the nice 19 job monopolizes one processor while the other
two nice 0 ones share a single processor.
This is really a showstopper for this kind of application :-(
