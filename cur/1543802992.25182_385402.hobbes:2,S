I'll show you one at xdevconf if I can get there, it has just a PCI-E
root bridge no graphics controller, we still init AGP on it but I
don't think there is any need, however for all the integrated
graphics, even if they don't advertise AGP they do use it which is
DaveJ's problem that he was trying not to load AGP if the AGP was
being advertised..
