Hi all,
I'm really interested on your comments/suggestions on my patch(1) 
based on first Pavel's code.
o It's fast,clean and arch independent
o Detect wrong mem= option and wrong memory size without 
  GPF anymore but with panic instead
on the other side:

If true, this is bad, but can be done also from user space programs after boot no?
Sorry to bother so many busy people but I find very responsible and safer that all 
the memory I'll use in user space was previously checked on boot by the kernel.
thanks,
luca
