Thanks. Yes, I should have done a better job of describing this new 
feature. I remember
finding description of shared trees very useful and meant to emulate it 
for unshare, but
got caught up in code fixes and didn't update the documentation. I will 
do so soon and
send it out so you have a more coherent information from which to make a 
decision.
