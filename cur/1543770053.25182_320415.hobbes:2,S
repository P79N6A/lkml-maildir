Thanks for the quick response.  Using sigsetjmp and siglongjmp makes
the program print two lines.
I read the setjmp / sigsetjmp documentation and misunderstood it.
I had already seen that if I inserted "signal (SIGSEGV, segv_handler)"
before the second setjmp (not sigsetjmp), the program (under 2.6
kernels) still would die.
I guess what happens there is that after coming back from the longjmp,
the error handler is still segv_handler, but the receipt of the SEGV
signal itself is blocked and if you take a SEGV when the receipt of
SEGV is blocked a program dies with a SEGV, even if you have a SEGV
handler.
