  neither gatos scanpci nor XFree86' scanpci do:
tv@vador ~ $ urpmf bin/scanpci
XFree86:/usr/X11R6/bin/scanpci
gatos:/usr/bin/scanpci
tv@vador ~ $ sudo strace /usr/X11R6/bin/scanpci 2>&1|fgrep open|uniq 
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib/i686/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)   = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/devices", O_RDONLY) = 3
   gatos scanpci directly access pci config space.
   also lspci, libldetect (used by mandrake drakx, harddrake2,
   lspcidrake tools), kudzu uses /proc/bus/pci/* rather thatn
   /proc/pci as you can easily check with strace :
tv@vador ~ $ sudo strace lspcidrake 2>&1|fgrep open
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib/i686/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)   = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/devices", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/usr/share/ldetect-lst/pcitable", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/usb/devices", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
tv@vador ~ $ sudo  strace lspcidrake -f 2>&1|fgrep open
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib/i686/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)   = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/devices", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/00.0", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/01.0", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1e.0", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.0", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.1", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.2", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.3", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.5", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/proc/bus/pci/01/0c.0", O_RDONLY) = 4
open("/usr/share/ldetect-lst/pcitable", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/usb/devices", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
tv@vador ~ $ sudo strace lspci 2>&1|fgrep open 
open("/etc/ld.so.preload", O_RDONLY)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib/i686/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)   = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/devices", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/01/0c.0", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.5", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.3", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.2", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.1", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1f.0", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/1e.0", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/01.0", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/proc/bus/pci/00/00.0", O_RDONLY) = 3
open("/usr/share/pci.ids", O_RDONLY)    = 4
    (i wont put every output but i've straced and checked kudzu source
    in the past, have read harddrake1 source, 'm writting harrddrake2
    and so i do know for those)
