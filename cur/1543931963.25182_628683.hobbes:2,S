Yes, yes, I see.

But this doesn't differ from the case when SIGKILL was already pending when
we enter ptrace_stop, and arch_ptrace_stop_needed() == false, that was my
point.
Yes, arch_ptrace_stop() can take a long time, might block, etc. But what
about TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE ? The task can recieve SIGKILL while executing the
syscall which can also block and so on, but do_syscall_trace(entryexit == 1)
doesn't check the pending signal.
I should clarify my question. What I can't understand is the subtle dependency
on the result of arch_ptrace_stop_needed(). This means that it is hard to
predict the behaviour.
IOW, can't we
	- ignore the pending SIGKILL (current behaviour)
		-- OR --
	- always check it unconditionally, before setting TASK_TRACED
? This looks a bit more consistent to me.
Please also note "before setting TASK_TRACED" above. With this patch we set
TASK_TRACED under ->siglock, and then change the ->state to TASK_RUNNING if
killed == 1. Minor, but this doesn't look correct, we can fool the tracer
which does ptrace_check_attach().
Oleg.
