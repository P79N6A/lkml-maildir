Yes, and the irqs can be routed at different cpus independently.
However not all hardware supports all 4K irqs.  4K is the implementation
defined maximu.  Although infiniband HCA's are rumored to support a
lot of irqs and it isn't uncommon for simpler nics to support 4 or so.
Conceptually think of it as having an irq controller embedded in your
pci device.
The MSI messages are writes to special addresses that are then
converted into CPU interrupts.

No.  That would be unnecessary coalescing.  Even if that was what the
hardware layer gave us the (and it doesn't) the generic layers should
demux these things as much as is reasonable.

Yes.  There is some potential there.  Although we would have to go
through an extra hoop to make it a pci specific handler type.

Yes.  Mostly.  Since dev_id is what is passed back to the irq handler,
it makes sense to pass the device when the irq is registered.
Passing the driver a pointer to the driver specific structure (not
the pci device) make a lot more of sense from an efficiency
standpoint.  Now it may make sense to remove the irq parameter
from irq_handler_t, and require drivers to look at their dev_id to
see which irq they really are processing.
There is a danger here of making things so generic you don't have good
performance, or the code becomes unnecessarily complex.

Yes.  There are other interfaces like /proc/irq/XXX/smp_affinity,
for irq migration.  There are also device specific ioctls.  There is
lspci.  I don't know what all else, and given the current state of the
kernel it is hard to grep for.

Well I can have meaning full flat numbers and on i386 and x86_64
except for msi I have that.  The problem is that for the numbers
to have meaning I get a very sparse usage of the numbers, because
very frequently the hardware interrupt controllers has pins that
are not connected up, so I have about an order of magnitude more
numbers then I have actually irqs in use.  That is before I start
reserving irq numbers for MSI.
For MSI (since they cannot be shared) it would actually make a lot of
sense to make the numbers domain,bus,device,func,(Nth device irq) but
I can't because bus,device,func is 16bits worth of number.  Add in
12 more bits for the worst case device assignment and I am up to
28 bits, and the rest of the 32bits can be used for domain or
something like that.  So while the current unsigned int irq works fine
for that backing that with a fixed size array allocated at compile
time is just hopeless.
