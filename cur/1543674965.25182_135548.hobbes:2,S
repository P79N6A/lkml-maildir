   I argue with that, NAPI needs to poll somehow, either you hook into the
   kernel slowing down every single schedule, or you need to offload this
   work to a kernel thread.
You've never shown what this "offloading work to a kernel thread"
actually accomplishes.
What I've seen it do is decrease the amount of total softirq work that
cpu can get done.  And avoiding ksoftirqd actually running makes
performance get better.
