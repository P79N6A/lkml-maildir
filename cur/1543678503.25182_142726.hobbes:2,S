Assuming that you use raid1 over nbd, you could try Peter T Breuer's patches 
for raid1 (called fr1) that allow the use of a bitmap for resyncing. I am 
also currently working on expanding on his patches to make the bitmap 
persistent (stored in a file) and to allow asynchronous writing to the 
"backup" (in this case, nbd) device.
Stay tuned...more details on linux-raid about this...
