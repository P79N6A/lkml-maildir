Hi!
What about doing something like this:
Then pcmcia nor any other module should have any problems, plus (that is
more important in my eyes) the same binary modules should work with 1G and
2G kernels. All the dirty work will be done by modutils automagically.
I hope it won't have any performance penalty, at least PAGE_OFFSET+const
should be optimized into the R_I386_32 reloc + const addend, PAGE_OFFSET+var
will be normal addition, var-PAGE_OFFSET will be normal subtraction (I
wonder whether const-PAGE_OFFSET is common), etc. Shifting PAGE_OFFSET down
should not happen IMHO in modules in the common case, if somebody sees it,
then some similar macro for modules can be added for ELF_ET_DYN_BASE and
TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE if needed, maybe USER_PTRS_PER_PGD but IMHO that is
really limited to the core kernel.
Anyway, this patch is untested (sorry, no ia32 around me), so if anyone
would like to actually test this and say to l-k if it works and does not
bring any optimization penalties, I'd be very happy.
