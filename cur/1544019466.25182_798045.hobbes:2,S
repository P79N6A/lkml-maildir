Sure - although it might make more sense to add any neede features to the
generic pty driver - hard to tell when you don't seem interested in
discussing that.

The linux kernel doesn't carry extra symbols for out of tree drivers. Why
should it - even keeping an index of them would be hard and it would be
impossible to know which ones are in use. Plus they change regularly -
the tty layer will change further soon for example, it's just having a
settling in period before the next big changes.

No you can provide the GPL symbol exports with the same patch as your pty
driver. There are millions of Linux users and each unused EXPORT_SYMBOL
costs memory to all those people - why should they carry that burden ?
