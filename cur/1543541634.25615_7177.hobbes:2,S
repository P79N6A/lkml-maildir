I haven't followed the 2.4 series closely. The first version I ran for
a longer period of time was 2.4.0-test3; I used it to try out the new
iptables/netfilter stuff. This version ran for a day and a half, so I
am fairly certain it did not show this behaviour.
2.4.0-test4 arrived shortly after -test3, and I noticed the error
quickly after I booted up -test4. I even posted a note to linux-kernel
about it on July 15th, titled "Something odd with 2.4.0-test4 - pipes
or suid/sgid broken ?" I though that the problem might be with running
mail-articles through a pipe and/or suid programs like procmail and
rnews, but it turns out that it was the innd problem.
Thinking back, I am not sure if I ran one of the test4-pre kernels.  I
*think* I did and it showed this behaviour, but I cannot say with 100%
certainty that I did.
The test4-pre patches are no longer available on the ftp.kernel.org
mirrors, so trying them out one by one is not possible for me.

No problem. I'd like to see this fixed as well :-)
Here's some background info about my system, in case it might be
useful:
* PII/350 uni-processor system (and compiled as such)
* Symbios 53c875 SCSI controller. My Linux system is on SCSI disks.
* 128 MB RAM; hasn't shown any signs of being faulty.
* Pretty much stock Red Hat 6.2 tools and configurations. Only
exceptions are Reiserfs used instead of ext2, and qmail instead of
sendmail.
* Not heavily loaded - I mostly use INN for mail-to-news gatewaying.
If you need any further info or want me to try out something, just
let me know.
