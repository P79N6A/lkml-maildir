Subject: Wanted: Kernel modules maintained outside the source tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Good day, all,
	(Quick background; Buildkernel is a shell script that handles the
kernel build process from beginning to end, from download to LILO/SILO.  
More details at URL in sig...)
	I'm adding support to Buildkernel for modules/packages/drivers
that are not part of the main source tree.  The support will hopefully
require no changes on behalf of the source tree maintainers or external
module authors.  This support will allow Buildkernel to build the external
module as the main kernel is being built.
	If you have, or know of, a module, package or driver that is not
currently part of the main source tree, would you please send me a URL to
it _in_ _private_ _mail_?  Please do not respond to the main kernel
mailing list; I'll post a list of all the URL's I get (with credit to you,
of course) to the Buildkernel site and send back a quick post to the
kernel mailing list to say it's ready.
	I'm specifically interested in packages that need to be built
against the kernel sources; i.e. ones that generally need to be recompiled
when a new kernel is built.  I'm already aware of:
	- pcmcia-cs (David Hinds, sourceforge)
	- freeswan (www.freeswan.org)
	- cipe (Olaf Titz, inka.de)
	- netfilter (Rusty Russell/Marc Boucher, netfilter.kernelnotes.org)
	If you're part of one of these teams and would be willing to work
with me on this, please let me know.
	Thanks for your time!
	Cheers,
	- Bill
