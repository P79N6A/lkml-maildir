Thanks. This, and the JFFS changes, look OK. I've merged the sched.h 
inclusion into CVS, albeit without the comment - the Linux include files 
are screwed up enough that it's best not to pretend there's any logic 
behind what you have to include :)
I'm not merging the s/MAJOR/major/ changes into my tree just yet - I'm still
vaguely hoping the new macro will change name before 2.5.2 proper.
