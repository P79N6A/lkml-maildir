I know of the document, but thank you for pointing it out, it's quite an
interresting read. Actually, reading that exact document ages ago was what
initially caused me to start reading the ELF loading code (thinking
"there's got to be something wrong here").
I've actually been planning to use some of the crazy stunts he pulls
with that code as validity checks of the code I want to implement (in
adition to specially tailored test-cases ofcourse).
