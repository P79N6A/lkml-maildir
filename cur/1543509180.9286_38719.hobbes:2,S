I was attempting to install onto a Lexmark Winbook laptop and am running
into a problem accessing the hard drive.
the boot code IDs the hard drive, but when it attempts to do the
partition check it generates read and seek errors.
for what little it is worth, win95 IDs the hard drive controller as
standard IDE, not as something propriatary.
This happens both with 2.2.6 and 2.2.12 kernels
I did not bring it in to work today so any suggestions will have to wait
until tonight to try them.
