No problem (I have plenty of other things to work on!), and thanks for the

That's good.  So I'll assume an updated version of kwatch can be submitted 
without regard to the progress of utrace (other than minor conflicts over 
the exact location of the ptrace code to change).

Right.  I had been thinking in terms of a developer using kwatch to track 
down some particularly nasty problem, something that would happen rather 
infrequently, where one wouldn't care about side effects on user programs.  
But of course those side effects might alter an important aspect of the 
kernel problem being debugged...
It's also true that the current kwatch version affects the user experience
even when no kernel debugging is going on, as it forcibly prevents ptrace
calls from setting the Global-Enable bits in dr7.  That at least can be
fixed quite easily.  (On the other hand, userspace should never do 
anything other than a Local Enable.)

How about a pair of callbacks: One to notify whenever the watchpoint is 
enabled and one to notify whenever it is disabled?

No doubt the future userspace API will include some sort of priority 
facility.  For now, though, ptrace doesn't have anything like it.  We just 
have to assign it an arbitrary intermediate priority.
So for the sake of argument, let's assume that debug registers can be 
assigned with priority values ranging from 0 to 7 (overkill, but who 
cares?).  By fiat, ptrace assignments use priority 4.  Then kwatch callers 
can request whatever priority they like.  The well-behaved cases you've 
been discussing will use priority 0, and the invasive cases can use 
priority 7.  (With appropriate symbolic names instead of raw numeric 
values, naturally.)
Or maybe that's too complicated.  Perhaps all userspace assignments should 
always use the same priority level.  After all, it's possible for multiple 
tasks to allocate the same debug register at the same time -- if they had 
differing priorities that would make it much more difficult to keep things 
straight.  Then there would be only three effective priority levels: 0 = 
well-behaved kernel, 1 = all userspace, and 2 = invasive kernel.

For now I would prefer to avoid that.  It's true that kwatch is intended
_only_ for kernelspace watchpoints, not userspace.  But I'd rather leave
the complications up to someone else.

Yes, I might add that in.

It seems likely that the interfaces added by kwatch will need to be
generalized in various ways in order to handle the requirements of other
architectures.  However I don't know what those requirements might be, so
it seems best to start out small with x86 only and leave more refinements
for the future.

In fact, something like that would be necessary if the debug register 
assignment could be changed silently as need arises.
If I update the patch, adding a priority level and the callback 
notifications, do you think it would then be acceptable?
