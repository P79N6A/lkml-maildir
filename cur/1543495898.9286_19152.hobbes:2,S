Hi there.
I note that the 2.3.2 kernel tree includes a new filesystem called
EFS, but there is apparently no documentation on what it is - no
entries in Configure.help and nothing elsewhere in the Documentation
tree either...
Does anybody know anything about this file system and what it's for?
Best wishes from Riley.
