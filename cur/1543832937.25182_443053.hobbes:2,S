Kinit SHOULD be merged into the kernel, and the responsibility of
creating the initrd/initramfs image should be moved from the
distribution into the kernel build process.  There can and should be a
way for distro's to add their own "value add specials" into the
initrd/initramfs image, but we have to take over creating the base
initial userspace environment.  It's not just uswsusp (still not
convinced it's a good idea, but if we're going to do it we have to
wrest control of the initramfs away from the distro's), but finding
and mounting iSCSI disks, LVM setup, etc.

When you load a SCSI driver (the one that bit me was the MPT Fusion
driver), it no longer waits for SCSI bus probe to finish before
returning.  So the RHEL4 initrd fails to find the root filesystem, and
bombs out.  This change was definitely made after 2.6.0, and is an
example of the sort of change which wouldn't have happened if kinit
was under the kernel sources and not supplied by the distro.

Some of this will probably need to be farmed out into files provided
by external packages, but I **hope** that they are true upstream
external packages, and not distro-specific specials, which is one of
the reasons why the current initrd/initramfs situation is
so.... unsatisfactory.  Clearly some kernel-mandated interface for
other packages to insert scripts and binaries during the early-boot
process would be a good thing; but the core initramfs functionality
should IMHO belong to the kernel.
