Since we can't know which O/UHCI is paired with which EHCI, we can't
really have generic code to deal with that race, but maybe we can be
smart and basically mutex khubd activity such as port reset vs.
registration of any new HCD ?
I'm not even sure module load order is 100% fault proof here since khubd
spawns as a thread...
