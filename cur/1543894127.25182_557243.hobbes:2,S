That may be a side effect of the GPL, but it's actually not how the GPLv2 
works (nor is it the intention). "Contribute back" means upstream. There's 
no such provision in the GPLv2, you contribute only downstream. And there 
are cases where you don't need to contribute at all.
E.g. the kernel hacking I'm doing at the moment: I have bought a uClinux 
blackfin board, for testing my digital audio amplifier. For that, I took 
one of the blackfin alsa audio drivers, and changed it so that it could 
talk to my digital audio amplifier. I'm not distributing this software, 
it's a complete in-house project, so I'm not obliged to contribute back. At 
the moment, I'm the only person in the world who has both access to the 
digital audio amplifier and the blackfin board, so releasing this driver in 
that early stage is a rather pointless excercise.
I think this above explains fairly well the "misunderstandings" that are 
appearing here. The GPL is not reflective (tit-for-tat), it's transient. If 
there's a loop in the transient propagation, it becomes reflective through 
the loop, but not by itself. This was the case in GPLv1, is the case in 
GPLv2, and will be the case in GPLv3.
