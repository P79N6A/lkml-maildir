  OK, good to hear :). My patch should be prone at least to this problem
(I'm not saying it could not have introduced any other ;). It locks the
buffer and if it needed to drop JBD spin locks, it also checks whether
the buffer remained in the BJ_SyncData list. Hence if the
journal_dirty_data() steals the buffer while we are locking it we find
that out and forget about the buffer. Once the buffer is locked,
journal_dirty_data() won't touch it.
  I guess the patch is good enough to send it to Andrew...
