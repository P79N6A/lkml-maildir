A follow up on this message. My first test completed with the following
results. The new code indicates:
X     - Min delay was     0. Max delay was     3. Ave delay was  0.015295.
top   - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    23. Ave delay was  0.025659.
netO  - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    31. Ave delay was  1.169024.
netI  - Min delay was     1. Max delay was    35. Ave delay was  1.182864.
diskW - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    18. Ave delay was  1.166944.
diskC - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    18. Ave delay was  1.080036.
diskR - Min delay was     0. Max delay was     7. Ave delay was  0.803804.
A "delay" was counted if 1000 iterations of the CPU inner loop took
longer than 10 usec. For comparison, I moved this code to my 2.4 system
and got the following results:
X     - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    17. Ave delay was  1.277730.
top   - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    12. Ave delay was  1.452692.
netO  - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    12. Ave delay was  1.633742.
netI  - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    12. Ave delay was  1.626565.
diskW - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    14. Ave delay was  1.566188.
diskC - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    12. Ave delay was  1.701542.
diskR - Min delay was     0. Max delay was    12. Ave delay was  1.650909.
Looks pretty comparable at this level. The 2.4 results appear to be more
consistent.
Grr. The new code does have an impact on the application measurements
under 2.4. It appears the TSC accesses are being delayed while the disk
is active. The within 100 usec rate was only 77% (was 90%) but the peak
is still pretty close (2.60 vs. 2.38 msec).
I am also not sure this is the "right" measurement either. I probably
need to count the delays or divide the overall loop time by the number
of delays to see if that is a more meaningful value.
