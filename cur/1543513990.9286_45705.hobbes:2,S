You _really_ failed to do it. Origin being 32V. Before both 4.0BSD and
SysIII, let alone 4.4BSD and SysV.

See above. It had been there since _long_.

Great. Let's _not_ bring BSD vs. Missed'em'Five flamewars here, OK?
Personally I got more than enough, erm, happiness when Sun switched from
sane system to the Bloat. YMMV.

Because some details of architecture are better than in all existing 4.4
derivatives.

Exactly. So _when_ do you need an ability to delete file in /tmp and
ability to replace its contents doesn't satisfy you?

A: Because it's a gratitious change in permissions semantics (aside of
many other reasons). You just do not run around changing this stuff
without a very good case. _Really_ good one. Same as above. Show me an
example of program that actually uses this detail of SysV semantics of
IS_VTX. Until then... If we are going to play the games with statistics -
fine, count the processors running the systems with current Linux
semantics. _Including_ Linux, please.
The bottom line:
a) this is historical behaviour of UNIX since late 70s.
b) most of the existing UNIX[1] installations does exactly that.
c) it is compliant with POSIX.
d) changing it is unlikely to buy you anything - I'm yet to see a program
that relies on the alternative behaviour.
e) compliance to SVr4 never was a stated goal (see (c)).
[1] Including Linux. And in the next couple of years the share is going to
increase, _both_ from Linux and *BSD sides.
