I will and resubmit later. The two changes were a bit related
(modifying the debugging made me do the module_param() cleanup 
because MODULE_PARM() and module_param() aren't both allowed
in the same module) that's why I originaly submitted a single patch.

Because pr_debug doesn't take into account the verbosity level
like pn_dbg() does.  A lot of drivers in drivers/pcmcia/ do use
such a construction...
