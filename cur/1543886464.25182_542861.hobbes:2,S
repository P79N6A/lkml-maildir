Hi Tejun,
your rework removes the "owner" field from the attributes. I think we
kept the "dev" and "uevent" attribute as part of "struct device" only
to be able to assign it the actual owner of the module that has
created the device. The attribute can probably just live as one
instance statically in the driver core now?
Thanks,
Kay
