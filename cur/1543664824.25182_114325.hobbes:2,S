Yes it would be encrypted.  Unfortunately it is predictable data and as 
such it is much easier to crack.  Better set that offset at a location 
computed from the encryption key.
On a side note I find it interesting that many people sugest compressing 
a file before encrypting it.  Take a look at the first few bytes of 
every compressed file.  Unless your going to get rid of that header...
