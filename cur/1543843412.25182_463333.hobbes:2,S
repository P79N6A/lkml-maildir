There's a third option, and that's the one i'm advocating: adding the 
tracepoint rules to the kernel, but in a _detached_ form from the actual 
source code.
yes, someone has to maintain it, but that will be a detached effort, on 
a low-frequency as-needed basis. It doesnt slow down or hinder 
high-frequency fast prototyping work, it does not impact the source code 
visually, and it does not make reading the code harder. Furthermore, 
while a single broken LTT tracepoint prevents the kernel from building 
at all, a single broken dynamic rule just wont be inserted into the 
kernel. All the other rules are still very much intact.
