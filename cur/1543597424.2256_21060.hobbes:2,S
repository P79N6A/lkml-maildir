Yes, I remember now.

Agreed.

The problem is that the "common code" isn't entirely common.  In most
instances, the previously-duplicated code would be different in some
way, with the ordering of initialisation being fairly strict.  The
templates allow for this to occur, with the "common code" residing
outside each driver, at least at the source code level.
There may be a way to get true runtime sharing happening, but again,
you'd have to talk to the guys at VA about this.
