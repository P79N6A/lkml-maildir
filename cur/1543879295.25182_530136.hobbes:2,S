  GPIODEV is considered to be low-level one and critical for speed, so
all method pointers assumed to be set properly. In particular, if some
operation is not available for a device (say, GPI/GPO case), a method
must be set to a stab function.
  BUG_ON would be acceptable, as it can be compiled out based on
CONFIG setting, but as was pointed out, doesn't add much into picture
anyway.
  But I'd be happy to add comment to struct gpiodev_ops declaration
about the described method constraints, thanks for comment.
