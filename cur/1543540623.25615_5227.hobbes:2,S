First, do the Canadian regulations apply to U.S. law as it exists on
the books, or it is U.S. law as it applied when the code was exported
to Canada?
Second, it's quite unlikely (IMO) that these regulations will be reversed.
Why?  Because they were -- rather explicitly -- implemented in
response to (a) liberalized regulations in the European Union (read:
it was starting to hurt business) and (b) successful court challenges.
