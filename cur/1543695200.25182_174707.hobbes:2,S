Do you know a good way to do that?  This is an example of something
where the 2.4 "Config.in" commands don't seem to offer even a vaguely
sensible way to constrain the configuration.  Or maybe you need to
be more expert in it than I am.
The rules for the moment should -- but AFAICT can't -- enforce:
   - Only one gadget controller driver, linked statically or as
     a module.  (Example:  net2280 or goku_udc, both on PCI.)
   - If controller driver is statically linked, either:
        * at most one gadget driver statically linked
        * any number of gadget drivers, linked as modules
   - Else if controller driver is linked as a module:
        * any number of gadget drivers, linked as modules
The 2.6 Kconfig is closest to supporting those rules, though I
don't know how to restrict it to "only one controller driver"
regardless of how it's linked.
I'd be open to a better solution than relying on the person
configuring the system to not make mistakes.
