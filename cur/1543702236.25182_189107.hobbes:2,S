So we want a pci_set_relaxed() macro / function() to set this bit
(otherwise dozens of drivers will start to try to set the bit themselves,
badly).  If this bit *isn't* set, setting the bit in the transaction will have
no effect, right?

How about always setting the bit in readb() and having a readb_ordered()
which doesn't set the bit in the transaction?  That way, drivers which
call pci_set_relaxed() have the responsibility to verify they're not
relying on these semantics and use readb_ordered() in any places that
they are.
No doubt you're going to smack this idea down by telling me what SN2
firmware currently does ...
