The 2^28 was my attempt (after little thinking) to avoid the 
overflow, but it still overflowed, so I disabled it. The problem with 
the limited number of bits is that you either have high precision or 
wide range, bot not both. I tried to find a compromise. I'm not 
affected to 2^28 in any way.

Nothing escpecially clever... Hmmm... viewing your patch I wonder:
You haven't changed the calibrate_tsc routine. Does it mean it works 
for you? So maybe my CPU (100MHz Pentium) is too slow. As indicated 
in the comment I had thought it should do from 64 MHz on (thus 
including a Pentium 75). I don't have the code here now, but have I 
missed something obvious (like the direction of the shift)?

That's on my TO-LOOK-AT list already. Thanks any way.
