Yes, at one time I ran MacOS, along with RamDoubler. It does compression
of RAM of some sort. It worked quite a bit better than the (quite crappy)
default MacOS VM implementation.

Yes, a good number of the kernel developers on the linuxppc-dev list are
using Motorola PowerPC embedded boards. These boards range from Pentium
100 equivalents (100mhz 603e) to 300Mhz PPC 750's (G3's)
