Dude, you have got to put down the conspiracy juice.
NOTHING IS IN STONE, because nothing has been committed to my 
repository, much less torvalds/linux-2.6.git.
A patch was posted, people complained, corrections were made.  That's 
how adults handle mistakes.  Mistakes were made, and mistakes were 
rectified.

Demonstrably false:  you cannot make that claim until the code is 
actually committed to Linux.

This is a classic straw man:

_You_ are paranoid about these changes, and you project your fears upon 
us.  None of this applies to the vast majority of Linux engineers.

Removing the copyright and license ON NON-DUAL-LICENSED CODE -- yes, 
that was wrong, and it was fixed.
But for dual-licensed code, it is fine.  The license text explicitly 
permits selection of one OR the other license.

Good engineers just don't have time for shite like this.  And our 
wireless guys are good engineers, just like Reyk.

You've missed the last ten years or so of Linux kernel development, 
haven't you?
Linux kernel peeps are traditionally not fans of the FSF (and that is an 
understatement in some cases).
Next time, please look at the facts before letting Theo lead you like a 
mind-numbed robot.
