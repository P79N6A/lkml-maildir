Right. Without preemption it is safe to do
	c = smp_get_cpuid();
       ...
        x = ++local_cache[c]
       ..
       y = ++different_local_cache[c];
      ..
With preemption this turns into a problem that is easier to solve
with a lock or by not having per-cpu caches in the first place -- 
eg by writing worse code. After all, those are just micro-optimizations
and a few percent here, a few percent there, nobody will notice it. -(
