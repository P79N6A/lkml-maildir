That's a reasonable enough assumption, to anyone who has never dealt
with software before, or whose data is just not important.
People who have dealt with computers for longer will know that anything
can fail at any time, and usually does unexpectedly and at bad moments.
Some defensive programming to deal with random failures could make your
project appealing to a lot more people than it would appeal to in its
current state.
