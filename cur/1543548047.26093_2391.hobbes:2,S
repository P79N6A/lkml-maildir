My gcc doesn't make differences between "memory" and non "memory" in this
testcase:
int * p;
extern f(int);
main()
{
	int a;
	a = *p;
	
	__asm__ __volatile__("zzz" : :);
	a = *p;
	f(a);
}
My compiler _always_ produced first the zzz and then it loads p
(regardless of "memory" clobber or not). That's why I said I couldn't
reproduce miscompilations.

In your testcase have only `//' in the underlined line, so the compiler is
100% allowed to throw away the first read to local_val, so far so good.
So the compiler does only one read from the `p' pointer and on with my
compiler it's always done _after_ the spin_lock (or after the __asm__
__volatile__ in the above testcase).
Of course "memory" should enforce the read to be done after the spin_lock
but in real life it seems to do the right thing anyway and I couldn't
reproduce miscompilation.
Said that if your compiler puts the read before the spin_lock without the
memory clobber, it is allowed to do that, and in such case you would proof
it was a real world bug (not just a "documentation" one).
Or maybe your testcase was a bit different then mine, in such case please
send it to me (I'm curious indeed :).
