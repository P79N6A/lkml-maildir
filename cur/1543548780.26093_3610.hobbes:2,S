How about something like the following compromise?
I haven't tried it out yet (and I've no idea whether or not Linus
would accept this) but it compiles, and it should definitely be better
behaved with respect to slowly-changing files.
As you can see, the idea is to look at whether or not the file has
changed recently (I arbitrarily chose a full minute as a concession
towards clusters with lousy clock synchronization). If it has, then
the page cache is zapped. If not, we force ordinary attribute cache
consistency checking.
Cheers,
  Trond
