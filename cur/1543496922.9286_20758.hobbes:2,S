Hi,
writing a programm that automatically mounts CDROMs, that are inserted, I
discovered a double tray locking in the IDE-CDROM / Uniform interface.
If you don't lock the tray upon mounting, you are able to remove the media. This
works with the SCSI-CDROM driver, but not with the IDE one without the attached
patch.
BTW, how can I check if the media is removed without actively polling the
status?
Currently I am doing:
for(;;) {
   if (ioctl(cdromfd, CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS, CDSL_CURRENT) == CDS_DISC_OK) {
      if(ioctl(cdromfd, CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED, CDSL_CURRENT) > 0) {
         /* A new media was inserted */
      }
      else {
         /* The old media is inserted */
      }
   }
   else {
      /* No media is inserted */
   }
   usleep(/* Some time */);
}
Instead of actively polling and sleeping, I would prefer the following:
select(cdromfd+1, 0, 0, fdset, NULL);
