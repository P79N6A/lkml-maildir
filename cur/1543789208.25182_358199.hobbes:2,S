Subject: Possible memory ordering bug in page reclaim?

Is there anything that prevents PageDirty from theoretically being
speculatively loaded before page_count here? (see patch)
It would result in pagecache corruption in the following situation:
1                                2
find_get_page();
write to page                    write_lock(tree_lock);
SetPageDirty();                  if (page_count != 2
put_page();                          || PageDirty())
Now I'm worried that 2 might see PageDirty *before* SetPageDirty in
1, and page_count *after* put_page in 1.
Or am I seeing things that aren't there?
Thanks,
