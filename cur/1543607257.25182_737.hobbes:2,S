Subject: Small bug with ZYNX 4-Port NIC (Tulip driver)

Regarding the tulip driver that comes default with 2.4.13-pre5:
There seems to be a problem with the ZYNX 4-port NIC.
It auto-negotiates and brings it's link up, but it's
advertise bits are set to (only) 10bt-FD.  If I force the
bits to 10/100 FD/HD (all 4 set, in other words), then the
NIC briefly reports this setting (while LINK is DOWN), but
as soon as it completes it's autonegotiation, the advert
bits are once again set to 10bt-FD.
I do NOT see this problem on the D-LINK 4-port NIC or the
EEPRO NICs I've been testing with....
Thanks,
Ben
