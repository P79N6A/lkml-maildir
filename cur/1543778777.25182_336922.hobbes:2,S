Hello,
According to the message, it's clear that powernow-k8 fits your CPU. I 
don't know the meaning of the error message, though.
First, have you upgraded your BIOS to the latest available version?
Also, you might have better feedback if you contact the cpufreq 
mailing-list: cpufreq@lists.linux.org.uk
