Hmmm... you are right. Comment is still misleading in respect to RAID.
ataraid driver is a _software_ RAID, just like Promise's binary driver.
FastTracks have software RAID. There are few true hardware FastTrak
RAID controllers with I2O interface but we probe for them properly in
pdc202xx_new.c driver and don't use IDE driver for them.

It is quite opposite.

What about this:
Ignore FastTrak BIOS
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
  Forces the driver to use FastTrak controller even if it was disabled
  by BIOS for Promise software RAID driver.
  Say Y if you do not use Promise's software RAID or
        if you want to use ataraid driver.
  Say N if you want to use Promise's binary module.

It has. According to Andre it is doable but big pain,
also Promise gives docs under NDA which makes it even harder.
Please search lkml archive if you want know technical details.

Comments in Promise driver need fixing.
