Subject: [PATCH] Defaults PS/2 mouse rate to 40 on the toshiba m300
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some models of Toshiba laptop have issues handling high rate data from an
onboard synaptics PS/2 touchpad. There already exists a blacklist of models
suffering from this problem which is used to cap the rate to 40pps. This patch
adds the Toshiba Portege M300 to the blacklist, as it also suffers from the
same problem.
