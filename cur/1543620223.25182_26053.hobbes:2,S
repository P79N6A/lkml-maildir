On UP sure, on SMP you'd need to allocate as many GDT entries as there are
CPUs and special case this in __switch_to too (something like
        loadsegment(fs, next->fs);
	if ((next->gs & 7) == 3 && next->gs >= 0x30 && next->gs < 0x30 + NR_CPUS * 8)
	  next->gs = smp_processor_id() * 8 + 0x33;
        loadsegment(gs, next->gs);
) which is kind of ugly (and userland must not save/restore %gs itself then).
Unlike d) with LDT, where unmodified glibc could work with older kernels
too, thus would mean strict kernel minimum version requirement (with LDT d)
it would be just an optimization).
