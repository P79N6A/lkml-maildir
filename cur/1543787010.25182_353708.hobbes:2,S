Last time I looked at the CKRM cpu controller code I found
it was quite horrible, with a great deal of duplication and
very intrusive large and complex.
It could have come a long way since then, but this code looks
much neater than the code I reviewed.
I guess the question of the resource controller stuff is going
to come up again sooner or later. I would hope to have just a
single CPU resource controller (presumably based on cpusets),
the simpler the better ;)
