That's actually using the NFSv2 protocol with the latest NFSv3 patches
(I've done some work on polishing up the sunrpc stuff). There were a
lot of cases in which the errors weren't reset, the timeouts weren't
being set properly before sleeping and the like. If it cures Thierry's
problem, and proves stable enough I'll pass the patch on to Alan.
Cheers,
