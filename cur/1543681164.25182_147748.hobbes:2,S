Ouch, I definitely liked more the POLLHUP thing. It is not linked to epoll
at all. Ok, suppose that our super-fast app choses Edge Triggered epoll
and also, aiming at topp speeds, using the smart read(2) trick :
void my_process_read(my_data *d, unsigned int events) {
	int n, s;
	do {
		s = d->buffer_size - d->in_buffer;
		if ((n = read(d->fd, d->buffer + d->in_buffer, s)) > 0) {
			process_partial_buffer(d, s);
			d->in_buffer += s;
		}
	} while (n == s);
	if (s == -1 && errno != EAGAIN) {
		handle_read_error(d);
		return;
	}
	if (events & EPOLLRDHUP) {
		d->flags |= HANGUP;
		schedule_removal(d);
	}
}
Where this will break by using a POLLRDHUP ?
