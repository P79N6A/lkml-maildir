Sorry, but I'm afraid you got this wrong. When the iSER transport is
used instead of TCP, all data is sent via RDMA, including unsolicited
data. If you have look at the iSER implementation in the Linux kernel
(source files under drivers/infiniband/ulp/iser), you will see that
all data is transferred via RDMA and not via TCP/IP.
