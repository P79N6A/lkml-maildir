Hmm.. This appended patch may or may not help.
It overwrites the SCSI command "req" pointer when the request has been 
done. The request cannot be used afterwards, so anybody accessing it would 
be a bug. I think.
HOWEVER. I noticed something else strange. Your slab corruption report 
says
	Slab corruption: start=f72948a0, len=64
	Redzone: 0x5a2cf071/0x5a2cf071.
	Last user: [<c02934eb>](sr_do_ioctl+0x11b/0x270)
	...
and the scary thing is that "len=64". 
The thing is, SCSI uses "SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE" to determine the maximum 
sense size to copy, and what do we have, if not
	include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h:#define SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE  96
ie a 64-byte buffer is simply TOO DAMN SMALL!
Now, the thing is, the 64 comes from "sizeof(struct request_sense)", which 
is what "struct packet_command *" uses. We can change that sizeof() to 
just use SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE, but that still makes me worry about 
somebody else having allocated a "packed_command->sense" using just the 
same 64-byte "struct request_sense".
Can a SCSI sense-buffer really be 96? If so, why is "struct request_sense" 
the wrong size? This looks likea really nasty bug.
