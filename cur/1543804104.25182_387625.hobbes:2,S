This is bad, as rwsems are pretty much guaranteed to be a cache miss on 
smp systems, so their addition makes these code paths scale much more 
poorly than is needed.  Given the current approach to modules, would it 
not make sense to simply require that any code that the notifier paths 
touch simply remain loaded in the kernel?  In that case rcu protection 
of the pointers would suffice for the hooks.
