You are just being silly. Any half-decent person (including my grandma,
seriously!) can set up distributions such as Mandrake and now maybe even
Red Hat. The problem I see, especially here (but atleast normal people
won't subscribe :P), is that a lot of Linux users hate proprietary
software and bla bla you get what I was going to say there. Anyways its
quite easy to set up a system and you no longer have to be a hobbyiest.
you did read IDC's predictions didn't you? Linux has a chance of
becoming #2 in the next year or so. Beats me what this had to do w/the
topic either..geez.
