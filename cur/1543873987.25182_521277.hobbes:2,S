I didn't suggest adding any unfairness!  I suggested being fair by 
user/job/process instead of being fair by thread (which is actually 
unfair as it favors multi threaded processes over single threaded 
processes).

I hope not.  I think that reducing the timeslice base, combined with 
renicing X all the way to hell should suffice.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
