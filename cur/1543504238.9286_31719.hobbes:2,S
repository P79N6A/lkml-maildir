I noticed a similar problem last night...
init re-exec'd (for config changes) and then my X server died of signal 4
(Illegal Instruction)  And refused to restart.
xdm was unable to fire up X...  restarting xdm made no difference
changing runlevels did.  All of my executables appear to be good.
System passes the memory tests I have (memtest86), and is known to be
reliable, if rather slow.  heh.
When X died, it took GPM with it...
Later that night, when doing a shutdown, I got the same swapwarnings
listed above.
