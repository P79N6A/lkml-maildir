Subject: [PATCH 2.6.19 00/10] Kernel memory leak detector 0.12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This series of patches represent version 0.12 of the kernel memory
leak detector. See the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more
detailed description. The patches are downloadable from (the whole
patch or the broken-out series) 
http://www.procode.org/kmemleak/
What's new in this version:
- updated to Linux 2.6.19
- fixed a series of false positives caused but not scanning all the
  data sections in modules (like .data.read_mostly)
- reduced the transient false positives by imposing a configurable
  threshold on the number of times an object needs to be detected as
  leak before being reported
