I'm not sure testing a valid ->next makes sense.  It could be non-NULL,
but poison, or if it was using list_del_init, it would be stuck in loop.

Heh, I agree, it doesn't feel quite right to acquire lock and release
lock in separate functions, but in the case of start/show/next/stop this
seems to be the design.  Alternative here seems to be keeping thing on
list with get and deleting from with put on last ref, but that didn't
look so simple.
