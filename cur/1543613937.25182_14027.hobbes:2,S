Yes.  I was about to reply to this effect.
X15 was a userspace httpd that operated using the Tux-designed
constructs -- sendfile and such.  IIRC, Ingo actually pointed out some
things Fabio did were non-RFC (sending the static headers may of been
one of them, since the timestamp was wrong) and Fabio made a lot of
changes.  X15 seemed promising, especially since it trumpeted that Linux
"worked" without sticking things in kernel-space, but I don't remember
if we ever saw source (let alone a free license)?
