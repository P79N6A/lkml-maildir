Okay, I see your point, thanks.  A couple of comments/questions:
- Does this make sense with devices with small kernel buffers?  From
my experimentation, pipes on Linux have a 4K buffer and tend to be
read and written very quickly.
- If I'm correct that pipes have a 4K kernel buffer, then writing 1
byte shouldn't cause this situation, as the buffer is well more than
half empty.  Is this still a bug?
Semantic issues aside, since Apache does the test I mentionned earlier
to determine child status and since it could be misled, should this
feature be turned off?
Thanks for your input.

If it's tourist season, why can't we shoot them?
