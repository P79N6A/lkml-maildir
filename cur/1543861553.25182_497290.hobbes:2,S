Yes. Do you also grasp the fact that there is no way for the allocator
to handle it either? So, double-free, from allocator standpoint can
_never_ be no-op.
What you're proposing is _not_ making double-free no-op, but instead,
making sure we never have a reference to p after kfree(p). However,
(1) that bloats the kernel text and (2) doesn't actually guarantee
that there are _no_ references to p (you can have an alias q for it,
but there's no way for us to know that).
