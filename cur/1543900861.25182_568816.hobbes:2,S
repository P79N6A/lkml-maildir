Patch looks ok to me, except for ...

Yes, as a matter of fact, he does have a different kernel tree, found at:
    
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/mm/
This is the infamous *-mm tree, which is currently at the following
version 2.6.22-rc6-mm1, and also available as a quilt patch set,
beneath:
    
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc6/2.6.22-rc6-mm1/
My guess is Andrew will prefer a patch against this *-mm kernel, though
sometimes he is a good chap and fixes up minor differences, such as
this involving htlb_alloc_mask replacing GFP_HIGHUSER.  If you had the
chance to verify your testing of this change against this
2.6.22-rc6-mm1, that would be worth doing.  Probably the change to
htlb_alloc_mask from GFP_HIGHUSER won't be any problem, but I suppose
that there's a small chance that some other patch in *-mm will interact
poorly with your proposed change.
Thanks for getting on this so quickly.
