I am still waiting for a reply to my question about the annoying pppd delay.
I think this one has even the best of Linux masters stumped.
Linus??? Alan??? Anyone? Don't tell me this is too difficult for you guys.
Come on, reveal the answer to this incredibly tough question.
What is causing pppd to pause for over a minute before it communicates with
the serial port?
If you guys still can't answer it, I will have to vandalize the source
code. That won't be pretty.
