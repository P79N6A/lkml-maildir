Are there any other ways that we might tag the callsite to let
modpost know that this instance is safe?  Adding a call to a wrapper
function in __init_refok space feels kludgy, and whatever comments
you stick on that function, it is sitting there waiting for someone
who shouldn't to make a call.
If not ... then just make the mca_bootmem() function take
no args.  It can calculate the amount of memory, it can do
the next bit too and return a result KERNEL_STACK_SIZE aligned
too.
