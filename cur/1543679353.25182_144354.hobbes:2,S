Just catching up on email after being away for a few days... so nbd 
isn't at fault then in mm2, correct? Your follow on emails at least 
seemed to indicate that there was a different problem that you in fact 
were encountering in mm2. If you find a problem though in mm2 w.r.t. nbd 
please let me know directly and I'll haul butt to get a fix out to you.
All the best ;-)
