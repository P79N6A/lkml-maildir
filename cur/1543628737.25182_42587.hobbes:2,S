Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.10] support for NCR voyager (3/4/5xxx series)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds SMP (and UP) support for voyager which is an (up to 32 way) 
SMP microchannel non-PC architecture.
There's basically nothing different from the 2.5.8 one except for a fix to the 
thread migration boot hang problem which is included.  I'm not announcing a 
separate arch-split patch because I'm still looking at fixes to the setup 
issues raised the last time (hopefully by the time I'm back from holiday on 8 
May).
The patch is in two parts:  The i386 sub-architecture split is separated from 
the addition of the voyager components

(The split diff is pretty huge because it's actually moving files about).  You 
must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
These two patches are also available as separate bitkeeper trees:
