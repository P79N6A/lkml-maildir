Uhh...  I still don't understand which behaviour do you want.
	* removal of this link, postponed to indefinite future (until we
do not have any users of that dentry) [ new behaviour ]
	* moment when the last link is gone _and_ nobody uses any dentries
pointing to object, with information taken from the last one still in use
[ old behaviour ]
	* actual destruction of file [ but we won't have any names to report ]
	* removal of this link, at the moment when it stops being accessible
[ none of the above, better done from vfs_...() ]
