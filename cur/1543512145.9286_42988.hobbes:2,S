Very true. The easiest way to solve _any_ problem is to have somebody else
do the solving.
Look, the problems with devfs are of two kinds:
- It really can't solve the problems it is supposed to solve
- The implementation might not be up to snuff
I really don't know about the second point, I'd assume that that is fixed
by now (it has been more than a year, isn't it?). If not, they can be
solved by the horde of devfs adicts. No need to involve the kernel hackers
in this.
The first one is the real stumbling block, IMO: devfs tries to solve the
(addmitedly very hard) problem of managing devices (which in turn are just
proxies for the _data_ they contain/convey, which is what you really want
to manage) by placing an automated naming system in between. This just
might be one of the minor building blocks for a solution to the real
problem (assuming the solution goes through "devices" with "names" that
look like "files").
