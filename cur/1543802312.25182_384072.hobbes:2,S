It appears CONFIG_RTC isn't related with the issue. In my test system,
if I didn't CONFIG_RTC, `date` shows wrong time, that's why I need RTC.

No. Setting day, month, century for alarm is optional. This means your
system doesn't support setting month and century. But maybe we should
print some infos here ...
