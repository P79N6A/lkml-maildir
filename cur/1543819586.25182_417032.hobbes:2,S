Neither expected nor satisfactory.  Sorry about that.  We were hoping
the straightforward shm/mprotect fix would be good enough, but it
appears not.  JVM is probably doing something we can allow with a
more complicated patch, but it _might_ turn out to be doing something
we simply cannot allow: I'll hope for the first and work out a patch
for that; but won't be ready to post it until tomorrow.
If you can get an strace of what it's doing, David, please mail that
to me; but I'm guessing that it may be hard to get, and dispiritingly
large: so don't worry unless it's easy for you.

Indeed, and sorry for the inconvenience.
