Ewwww. Isn't some of that shared most of the time though?

28 bytes per *mm* is nothing, and I still think the prio_tree is 
completely unneccesary. Nobody has ever demonstrated a real benchmark
that needs it, as far as I recall.

I don't care about the 4 bytes much (other than that the current 64 happens
to be a nice size). I just don't see the point in making copies of the 
binding structure all the time ;-) Refcounts aren't that hard ... didn't
Greg do a kref just recently? ...
