Yeah but that's because you're creating in ext2 which is clueful about
such things. for vfat you'd have to create an evil translator that takes
.lnk files and translates them to symlinks and vice versa. And it would
have to do it transparently. And then you'd have to wonder what windows
would think of a .lnk file that pointed to a partition it doesn't think
exists. :)
Sounds like fun to me. :)
