Practically certain to be fixed by 6addb1d6de1968b84852f54561cc9a999909b5a9;
it's list_for_each_entry() walking from the entry that just got list_del()
and kernels without that sucker have no protection of the list in question
whatsoever.

pissfs locking problems; AFAICS, its sysfs_get_dentry() walking into
already unlinked sysfs directory node on the way to target; no exclusion
against that is there and it's not trivial to add.
