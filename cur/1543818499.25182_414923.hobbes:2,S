The existing definitions define pte_page and pmd_page to return the struct
page for the pfn contained in that entry, and pmd_page_kernel returns the
kernel virtual address of it.  However, pud_page and pgd_page are defined
to return the kernel virtual address.  There are no macros that return the
struct page.
No one actually uses any of the pud_page and pgd_page macros (other than
one reference in the same include file).  After some discussion on the list
the last time I posted the patches, we agreed that changing pud_page and
pgd_page to be consistent with pmd_page is the best solution.  We also
agreed that I should go ahead and propagate that change across all
architectures even though not all of them currently support shared page
tables.  This patch is the result of that work.
