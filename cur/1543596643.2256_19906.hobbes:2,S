One possible problem is that many Apple monitors only work at a fixed
horizontal frequency - the Apple Studio 17 monitor (with the
transparent case) that I use with my G4 cube is like that, it will
only operate at horizontal scan rates between 79 and 82 kHz.  If the
kernel video driver chooses a video mode with a scan rate outside that
range the screen goes black.  So I have to put video=aty128fb:vmode:20
on the kernel command line to avoid that.  (It would be nice if the
kernel driver did DDC but it doesn't.)
Other than that, you might get more useful suggestions if you ask on
the linuxppc-user@lists.linuxppc.org mailing list.
Paul.
