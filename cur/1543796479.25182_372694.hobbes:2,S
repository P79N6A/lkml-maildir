I meant the ipmi, smbus and copa modules by Fujitsu-Siemens.
They are provided in source form, but I just found out (reading the
headers and not just the lines that broke the compile) they are not open
source. Perhaps one should prod them to slap a modified-BSD or perhaps
GPL label onto their modules.
It seems you'd then maintain them after their submission? :-)

These use inter_module_get() (ok, inter_module_get_request isn't
difficult) and some #include headers that have moved around between
linux and asm directories.
