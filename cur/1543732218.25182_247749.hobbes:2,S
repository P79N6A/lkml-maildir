The motivation for doing this, is the ambitioned idea, that _data_ should
only be exposed through sysfs values to userspace. This would make it
possible for userspace to scan any state at any time, regardless of a
received event. Which should make the whole setup more reliable, as
applications can just read in the state at startup. We do a similar job
with udevstart, as all lost hotplug events during the early boot are
recovered just by reading sysfs and synthesize these events for creating
device nodes.
The same applies to the way back to the kernel. We don't want to send
data over the netlink back to the kernel, we can write to sysfs.
Very "simple" data still can be specified by the signal string, just
like a "verb" that describes, what actually happened with the kobject.
In the mount case, we send a "mount/unmount" event for the physical
device, and userspace can read "/proc/mounts" for the data, as
applications do today by polling.
Another version to do this (similar to Robert's CPU overheating example
above), is to create a owner value in the blockdevice's kset and let the
device claiming code fill that value. Then the signal may just be a simple
"add/remove" event for the "owner" file at device claiming and release.
Yes, it may require, that some things in the kernel need to use kobjects
to represent it's state to userspace, but that is a nice side effect and
better than a complicated definition, what the event may carry ot of the
kernel with every specific event, I think.
If you can think of any case we can't expose enough data with this model
or we will not be able to use sysfs, let us know.
Thanks,
Kay
