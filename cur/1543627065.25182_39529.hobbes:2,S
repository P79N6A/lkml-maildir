I see.  So this is all your fault :)

When a page is marked dirty, the path which is followed
is page->mapping->host->i_sb.  So in this case the page will
be attached to its page->mapping.dirty_pages, and
page->mapping->host will be attached to page->mapping->host->i_sb.s_dirty
This is as it always was - I didn't change any of this.

Right.  Presumably, the pages hit the disk via the hosting inode's
filesystem's mechanics.
And it remains the case that Coda inodes will not be marked DIRTY_PAGES
because set_page_dirty()'s page->mapping->host walk will arrive at
the hosting inode.
