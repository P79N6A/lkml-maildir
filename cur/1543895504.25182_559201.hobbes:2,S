The common use for cpu_relax() is basically for code that does
	while (*ptr != val)
		cpu_relax();
so yes, an architecture that doesn't notice writes by other CPU's on its 
own had *better* have an implied read barrier in its "cpu_relax()" 
implementation. For example, the irq handling code does
	while (desc->status & IRQ_INPROGRESS)
		cpu_relax();
which is explicitly about waiting for another CPU to get out of their 
interrupt handler. And one classic use for it in drivers is obviously the
	while (time_before (jiffies, next))
		cpu_relax();
kind of setup (and "jiffies" may well be updated on another CPU: the fact 
that it is "volatile" is just a *compiler* barrier just like cpu_relax() 
itself will also be, not a "smp_rmb()" kind of hardware barrier).
So we could certainly add the smp_rmb() to make it more explicit, and it 
wouldn't be *wrong*.
But quite frankly, I'd personally rather not - if it were to make a 
difference in some situation, it would just be papering over a bug in 
cpu_relax() itself.
The whole point of cpu_relax() is about busy-looping, after all. And the 
only thing you really *can* busy-loop on in a CPU is basically a memory 
value.
So the smp_rmb() would I think distract from the issue, and at best paper 
over some totally separate bug.

Sure. I agree - we can get into a loop that calls yield(). But I think a 
loop that calls yield() had better be ok - we're explicitly giving the 
scheduler the ability to to schedule anything else that is relevant. 
So I think yield()'ing is fundamentally different from busy-looping any 
other way. 
Would it be better to be able to have a wait-queue, and actually *sleep* 
on it, and not even busy-loop using yield? Yeah, possibly. I cannot 
personally bring myself to care about that kind of corner-case situation, 
though.
