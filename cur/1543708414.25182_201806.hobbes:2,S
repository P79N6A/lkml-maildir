Well, considering that X is suid root, it's okay to require that it be 
run at nice -15, but how is the user without root access going to renice 
xmms?  Even for those who do, they're not going to want to have to 
renice xmms every time they run it.  Furthermore, it seems like a bad 
idea to keep marking more and more programs as suid root just so that 
they can boost their priority.
Not to say that your idea is bad... in fact, it may be a pipe dream to 
get "flawless" interactivity without explicitly marking which programs 
have to be boosted in priority.  Still, Nick and Con have done a 
wonderful job at getting close.
This is a tough problem.
