Hello,
  I am running a new Gigabyte GA-8IPXDR dual Xeon board under Linux.  I
can get everything to work with stock 2.4.x, 2.4.x with acpi and 2.4.x
with acpi and booted with pci=noacpi, all of this is using 2.4.20-rc3
with the latest acpi patch from sourceforge and the new aic7xxx driver.
If I try and boot either 2.5.49, 2.5.49-bk or 2.5.49-mm1 the kernel gets
as far as loading the scsi driver and then it starts acting very weird.
I starts issuing the debug messages and card state dumps that are
normally only printed when interrupts aren't setup correctly.  This is
very odd considering 2.5.49 should be using the same acpi code as
2.4.20-rc3 with the patch in place.  Also I can't boot 2.5.49 under any
circumstance including acpi=off and/or pci=noacpi.  The board uses the
Intel E7500 chipset and has onboard U160 (AIC-7899).  I am attached
gzipped copies of a working dmesg from 2.4.20-ac3, /proc/interrupts and
/proc/cpuinfo. 
I don't have a serial console to grab the failing boot messages from
2.5.x but they are the same messages everyone else gets from the aic7xxx
driver when things are going according to plan interrupt wise.  Thanks
for any help.
Jordan
