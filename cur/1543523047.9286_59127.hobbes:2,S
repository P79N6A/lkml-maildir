Ok, before this gets out of hand, let me just clarify:
 - under loads like the above, scheduling speeds MEANS ABSOLUTELY
   NOTHING.
Nada. Zilch. Zero.
You aren't spending any time scheduling - you're spending all the time
COMPUTING.  The high load is because you're compute-bound, and you
probably end up scheduling maybe a few hundred times a second. If that.
With a default timeslice in the 10-200 millisecond range (Linux defaults
to 200ms, and that's probably too dang long), compute-active processes
aren't really much an issue. 
Basically, the situation where you have BOTH
 - large number of runnable processes
AND
 - lots of scheduling activity
are very rare indeed.  They are rare even in threaded code, unless that
threaded code has a lot of synchronization points and a lot of
synchronous inter-thread communication. 
The IBM numbers are very interesting. The cache-line optimization is an
obvious performance advantage, and has been incorporated into the recent
kernels. But I think some people think that this is a common problem,
and think that "load average" automatically equals scheduling. It isn't,
and it doesn't.
