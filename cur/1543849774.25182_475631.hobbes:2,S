Hi All,
Hopefully, kmalloc() should always succeed. But if it doesn't then the kernel is going to crash
left and right. But I guess that there's no point in running if there is no memory. Anyways, here
is what I found at many places:
func()
{
   char *a; 
   char *b;
   a = kmalloc(10, GFP_KERNEL);
   if (!a)
       goto error;
   b = kmalloc(10, GFP_KERNEL);
   if (!b)
       goto error;
 error:
  kfree(a);
  kfree(b);
}
So, if memory allocation to 'a' fails, it is going to kfree 'b'. But since 'b' is not initialized,
 kfree may crash (unless DEBUG is defined).
I have seen the same case at many places when allocating in a loop.
Regards,
Amit
