I'm not sure if this is sufficient. The low level interfaces need to be
exposed, and if we are not expecting modules to pay attention to the
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ setting, then the all of these interfaces need to be
overridden.
However, do we even need this #ifdef CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ block at all?
What does it matter if modules register or unregister events, if they
cannot be called?
The old code only zaped the enable if sysrq was not defined, and that is
what I'm doing in the table. Some real changes would be neccessary to
actually drop out the whole system.
There is also no real reason to try and no-op these functions for speed,
as they are trivial and FAR outside of the main call path.
So the way to go I see here is:
 a) allow the registration functions to always be defined.
and either:
 b) handle the return failure in the __sysrq_XXX functions themselves,
 c) or not.
