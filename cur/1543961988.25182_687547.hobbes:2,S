We already have some information, Rafael is tracking this info. But we need
other developers to look at others' bugs. If we considered that for each
release, the *worst* subsystem does not get any new features merged, maybe
the ones who really want to get theirs merged will quickly take a look at
their not-so-friend coworkers's work to try to get their score up and
avoid getting spotted.
After all, that's what we want to achieve : better cross-testing. For
2.6.27, we would probably have Davem happy to report one hundred of
bugs brought by Ingo and ban him from next merge. But if that's the
only way to find 100 buts in one release cycle, hey that's quite
efficient! And in turn, Ingo would have more time to fix (or deny)
bugs assigned to him, then take a look at his accuser's code for next
release.
Not very moral, but the kernel team has evolved from a small team of
buddies to a large enterprise. And to survive this evolution, we may
need to apply the immoral principles found in big companies.
