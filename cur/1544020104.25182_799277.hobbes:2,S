If you can try the patch I just sent out, and use that as a base for 
trying to track down why the heck the legacy code doesn't work, that would 
be great. It might fix it (assuming my guess about "restore_state while in 
PCI_D3 doesn't work" was correct), but quite frankly, it's equally 
possible that it just makes things worse. But it would be really 
interesting to hear..
Your machine does seem to be interesting, in that not only does it have a 
PCI-E bridge in it (the eeepc I was playing around with at LCA does not), 
but judging by the lost config state I also suspect that it actually loses 
power during STR.
Which is not at all necessarily a given - I suspect it depends on just how 
the power rails are set up on the motherboard. The fact that PCI-E bridges 
have apparently worked for others implies that your problems don't happen 
for everybody, and may relate to that issue.
