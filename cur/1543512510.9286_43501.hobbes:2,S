Hello,
  I've tried to get $(SUBJ) card working on linux kernel 2.3.19. It didn't
work at all. When the EtherExpress 16 driver tries to read hw address
(when I specify io, irq), it returns 00:00:00:00:00:00. The probe function
will not read correct card ID at none of available io.
  I noticed, that several people already met this problem. But I didn't
see a solution anywhere - mostly they threw the card away... It seems to
me, that there's no support for this card in linux currently. Am I right?
  I would like to do something in this area, but I'm not able to get hw
specification for this card anywhere. (afaik the EtherExpress 10 isn't
EtherExpress 16?) Any hint?
  M$ Win runs with the card without problem :-( ...
				Thanx for any advise,
							Jim
