Subject: [PATCH] define setup_arch() in header file

When running sparse over an ARM build of 2.6.16-rc5, I came
across this error, which is due to setup_arch() being used
be init/main.c, but not being defined in any headers.
This patch adds setup_arch() definition to include/linux/init.h
The warning is:
  arch/arm/kernel/setup.c:730:13: warning: symbol 'setup_arch' was not declared. Should it be static?
