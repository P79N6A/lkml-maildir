Have you applied SGI's IRIX patches to your server (the one that makes
the cookies take 32-bit values)?
Alternatively, you can forward-port the old 2.4.x cookie hack to 2.6.x
(that should be fairly trivial to do). You can find the patch on
http://client.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.4.x/2.4.26/linux-2.4.26-02-seekdir.dif
Cheers,
