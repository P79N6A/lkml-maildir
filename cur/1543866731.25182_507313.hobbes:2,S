[ohci1394_early]
Some remarks to the September 2006 version at
http://www.suse.de/~bk/firewire/
 :
  - Seems its .remove won't work properly if more than one OHCI-1394
    controller is installed.  And it's .probe isn't reentrant, but that
    might be less of a problem.
  - Its functionality will be lost if there is a FireWire bus reset,
    e.g. when something is plugged in or out.  To keep physical DMA
    alive, an interrupt handler had to be installed which writes ~0
    to OHCI1394_PhyReqFilter{Hi,Lo}Set.  Can interrupt handlers be
    registered in an early setup stage?
  - There might be some register accesses in the setup which could be
    omitted; I'd have to look this up.
  - Could be optimized to not use ohci1394.h::struct ti_ohci.
  - PCI_CLASS_FIREWIRE_OHCI can be replaced by
    include/linux/pci_ids.h::PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_FIREWIRE_OHCI which
    was newly added in 2.6.20-git#.
  - I suppose .probe should check for PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_FIREWIRE_OHCI
    instead of PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_FIREWIRE.
  - How about dropping support for configuring this as module, to
    simplify the code?  Unless this would interfere with ohci1394; and
    it probably would if there was an interrupt handler...
  - "depends on X86_64" is missing in Kconfig.
  - Maybe put it into arch/x86_64/drivers/ instead of drivers/ieee1394?
  - Plus what I mentioned earlier in the thread.
I could send code to address some of this at next weekend or later.
