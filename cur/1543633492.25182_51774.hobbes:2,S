Trond,
I realize that the transport is hidden to NFS. However, in the situation I 
described, the NFS client did not behave well: it seemed to lock up totally 
for a period of 10-15 minutes.
Other packets were able to make it into and out of the machine: I could 
telnet/ssh/rlogin. The user could not interrupt the process, despite the 
fact that the mount options included "intr".
My point is that the use of half-duplex may prevent the NFS client from 
sending or receiving (probably sending) some packets. But, since the 
processes that caused the load had stopped doing anything and other packets 
were passing in and out, the NFS client should have been able to recover 
earlier.
