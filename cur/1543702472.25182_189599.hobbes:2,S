Greets everyone;
I'm setup to use libusb here, rahter than drivers/usb/scanner in the 
kernel config.
Up to 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 and possibly a little later, my scanner worked 
just fine.  But now on 2.6.1-rc3 its disappeared.
I also have everything in the i2c category except i2c-dev (builtin) as 
modules trying to find some combination that will let sensors run.
I had all that compiled in the last time it worked.
Also, gnomeradio just segfaulted on startup and left the radio on when 
it did.  That also worked previously.
Ideas?
