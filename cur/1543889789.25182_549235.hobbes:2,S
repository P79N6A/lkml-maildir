I am.

No, I'm putting the code into userspace and testing it there. Its not
difficult since there is little support needed from the kernel for
either set of code.
The tester runs each one in turn under the same circumstances from the
same binary and gives me a speed for each. Multiple runs return
consistent values and I'm being careful to make sure its an otherwise
idle machine and processes enough data to make sure there is no nasty
cache effects.

Agreed, and I still have the security and maintainability concerns. Add
them all together and its more unattractive.
