Since when this is a valid reason to NACK a patch which fixes 
a regression in the 'stable' kernel ? 
Probably you may want to ask first whatever 'b43' works for Alexey ?
and most probably the answer will be 'no' because that is the only reason 
one would want to fix the *old* one when *both* drivers are enabled.
Really 'Switch to foo' and 'foo_old will be removed sometimes' 
is not a 'valid' reason to NACK anything as long you 'have foo and foo_old' 
*supported* in that kernel.

Fix it different then.

Yes it is but that is still not a valid reason to NACK that patch , I'm sorry.
