We used to be able to call the pci probe functions from different
threads for different devices.  But people seemed to like to enable
options that told them their box could blow up into tiny pieces and then
got upset when it did.  So I removed the option :(
So you don't have to worry about it now, but note that it could race
with the remove function if two different devices are in the system, one
being added and one removed at the same time.  So you should protect it
with a spinlock or something.
thanks,
