You don't seem to use any synchronization mechanism to protect the
ioproc list from concurrent modifications, right ?
I understand that it might be useless as long as QsNet is the only user
of ioprocs and takes care of locking the address space somewhere in the
driver before adding/removing hooks.
But, if this patch is to be merged to the mainline, you probably need
to do something here. It's not clear how other in-kernel users
(IB, Myri, Ammasso, ...) might use ioprocs.
And actually, I think all ioproc list traversal need to be protected
as well.
A spinlock_t ioproc_lock is probably appropriate here.
I don't know whether any of the existing locks in the task_struct
might be used instead.
