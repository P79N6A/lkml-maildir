it's not really much different than the 2.4 kernel already has.
In 2.4 you have a 8Kb stack of which
First 1600 bytes (+/-) are for the task struct
about 4Kb of user context stack
>= 2Kb stack which is needed for irq context (both soft and hard)
In 2.6 with this patch you have
32 bytes for thread info
4Kb minus 32 bytes for context stack
SEPARATE softirq stack of 4K
SEPARATE hardirq stack of 4K
so in a way you have MORE stack space than in 2.4.
Now I'll fully admit the 2Kb is somewhat of a stochast, you only hit it
if you have iptable rules and 2 nic irq's arriving on the same cpu at an
unfortionate moment, but that doesn't mean it's a safe situation.
