Problem with A): You make "Long filename xyz.txt" => "LONGFI~1.TXT" and
then "Long filename abc.txt" => "LONGFI~2.TXT".  Now, backup and
restore.  If the files are restored in alphabetical order, then the
names are backwards.  That is, now "Long filename xyz.txt" =>
"LONGFI~2.TXT" and "Long filename abc.txt" => "LONGFI~1.TXT".  It
doesn't matter if you are restoring just one file or the whole
filesystem - the names can still get destroyed.
Problem with B): Windows stores the generated short filenames instead of
the original long filesnames in the registry for some random things.
For example, IIRC, the list of registered DLLs uses all short names.
The short name also ends up in the Start menu sometimes (or in any
shortcut).

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
