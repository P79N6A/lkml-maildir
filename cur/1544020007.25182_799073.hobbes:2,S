Reducing it to 1 HZ was kind of a performance hack: running NMIs at HZ 
needlessly interrupts the CPU HZ times a second. It's more than enough to 
have 1 nmi-watchdog tick per second to notice deadlocks that take longer 
than 5 seconds.
Can you see a problem with that approach, or was this just a question 
about why it's reduced to 1 Hz?
