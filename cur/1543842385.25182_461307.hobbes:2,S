Hey, thanks for the review.
I don't think so but a comment or two might be in order.
Calling filldir with the filename is the important part,
and the only real error is if filldir fails.
The rest of the logic is about populating and querying the
dcache so we can find our real inode number, if every reasonable
attempt to perform a dcache lookup fails I simply set the inode
number to 1 and use that in filldir.  It's wrong but at least
I report the file is there.
If I can find the dentry I lookup the inode and the inode
number and file type, and the dput the dentry.
If I can't lookup the dentry I attempt to create it.
instantiate will return a dentry or NULL if the dentry I preallocate
for it is good enough.
Is there something specific you are not seeing?
Eric
