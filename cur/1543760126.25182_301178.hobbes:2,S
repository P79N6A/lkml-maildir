Hello,
  In the ChangeLog-2.6.11 file I read that the enhanced I/O accounting
data patch and the enhanced memory accounting data collection patch were
added. It's cool but I don't see how this stuff is used because
information is never dump in a file or send to an accounting application
(or I miss something). 
  Maybe we should update the ac_io in the "struct acct"? Thus, values
will be dump in the accounting file. Maybe it could be something like:
--- acct.c.orig	2005-03-09 14:17:07.000000000 +0100
+++ acct.c	2005-03-09 14:18:20.000000000 +0100

 				     current->group_leader->min_flt);
 	ac.ac_majflt = encode_comp_t(current->signal->maj_flt +
For memory and read/write syscall we may add new fields. 
Best regards,
Guillaume
