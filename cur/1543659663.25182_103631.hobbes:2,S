Probably.

Hmm. The old xconfig was so unusable I haven't used anything but  
menuconfig for years ...

Strange. Filesystems (which everyone should be familiar with) certainly do  
this, and so does (for example) Pegasus Mail with IMAP folders ...
I think Pine and bookmarks are faulty here. (Especially as in the current  
Mozilla, you *can* have folders-as-bookmarks but you can't easily switch  
from one behaviour to the other, plus Mozilla itself sometimes gets  
confused. Also, Open File insists on files even though Mozilla can handle  
local directories just fine ...)

Well, that's certainly how it always was with menuconfig.
