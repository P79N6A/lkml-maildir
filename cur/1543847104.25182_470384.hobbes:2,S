Subject: [PATCH, RAW] IRQ: Maintain irq number globally rather than passing to IRQ handlers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is the raw, un-split-up first pass of the irq argument removal 
patch (500K):	
http://gtf.org/garzik/misc/patch.irq-remove
Notes:
* raw first pass, DO NOT APPLY.
* this was useful work:  it turned up several minor bugs
* Do we mark irq handlers FASTCALL?  If not, we probably can now.
* I also turned up a few obvious places that dhowells missed in his 
pt_regs patch, inevitably in non-x86 arches that probably were not built.
* I need to fix up ~10 or so drivers that called their interrupt 
handlers directly, then used a 'irq == 0' test to determine whether the 
interrupt handler was called internally, or by the system.
* not sure yet if I want to mark the parport "irq handler" functions as 
truly irqreturn_t
* Hopefully I will have this polished by the end of the day.
