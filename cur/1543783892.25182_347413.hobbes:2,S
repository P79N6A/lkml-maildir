historically the main problem with using the kernel driver was getting hold of
an ATM aware pppd.  The step "USE="atm" emerge ppp" looks like gentoos way of
installing such a pppd.  Nowadays several major distributions ship with an
ATM aware pppd, so if you are using one there is nothing to be done.  Likewise,
most distributions ship a kernel with speedtch support.  So if you're using
such a distribution all you have to do to use the kernel driver is
"place the firmware in /lib/firmware".
On the other hand, it is misleading to say that with the user mode driver
all you have to do is place the firmware in /lib/firmware.  That's only
true if your distribution (eg: Mandrake) explicitly supports the user mode
driver and has pre-installed and configured it for you.  If you don't have
such a distribution then setting up the user mode driver, while not difficult,
does require some work.

I'm the one who fixed most of those problems by the way.

Tell me what problems you've been seeing and I will try to fix them.
All the best,
Duncan.
