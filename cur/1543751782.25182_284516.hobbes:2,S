I would also be interested in the output of dmidecode [1] for your
system. This would allow me to add a workaround for your board to the
it87 driver, since the BIOS seems not to properly intialize the chip.
Sadly, there are probably many other boards which would need similar
workarounds for this chips or any other with PWM capabilities, and I
would better see the bogus BIOSes fixed than as many workarounds in our
drivers...
BTW, if you don't have the latest version of your motherboard BIOS
already, it could be worth upgrading, just in case it helps (I wouldn't
put too much hope there though).
