Same here - I gave up with 2.1.125 because of the flaws in it, and am
thankful most of them were fixed in time for 2.2.0.

I've built EVERY one of the 2.2 series kernels several times for
several different configurations, and I've yet to find one that was
unstable, announced or otherwise.
Best wishes from Riley.
