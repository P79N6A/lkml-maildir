   Could you elaborate on what bad things happen here?
   
Kernel stack allocation is defined per-architecture.  On
sun4c sparc systems, we carve virtual pages out from the kernel
address space and hard map them into the TLB by hand.

   Yep.  MIPS's KSEG0 (a stupid design if there ever was one)
Actually, KSEG0 the most Linux friendly design in the world
particularly in 64-bit mode.  There is no need to have page tables at
all for the main kernel physical memory map.  It would shave a lot of
code from the sparc64 TLB miss handlers if I didn't have to handle
PAGE_OFFSET pages, for example.
Alpha does something akin to KSEG0 as well.
I pine constantly for it appearing some day on a future UltraSPARC
revision :-)
