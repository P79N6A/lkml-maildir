Went home and tried again. It builds fine in git repo, but again
whenever i make an archive using git-archive --format=tar
--prefix=linux-2.6.18/ HEAD | bzip2 > linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2 , i get the
problem with this bzipped tree.
I removed .gitignore file from the my git repo and added manually
rules to .git/info/exclude instead. This did the trick and
git-archiv'ing did not result in a broken bzipped tree.
Perhaps i did something silly or may be something to do with git. ??
Thanks for the hint Sam.
