Here comes a batch of patches for the via-rhine driver. Please apply.
via-rhine is still hardly usable on the most common Rhine hardware; it
can't sustain 100Mbps traffic. The changes presented here improve the
situation considerably; they fix a number of real problems and have been
tested for regression (alas, by few people).
