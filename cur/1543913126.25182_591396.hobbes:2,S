To be precise its Macbook 1st Generation non pro.  with subsystem id 0x106b0a00
Well a friend of mine has the same model and i tried things out on his machine.
to my surprise :(, the original 2.6.23-rc5 is working fine on his machine.
So on my machine we booted to windows and tested things out. The sound
on my machine doesn't work in windows either, although its working in
OSX.
So sorry for all the noise its most likely a hardware problem after all.
Although i am baffled as to why old pin config works on this
particular broken hardware.
I hope i didn't bug you too much, i appreciate your quick responses.
