The stuff that is written in the kernel by printk() can be configured
to go to an RS-232C port. This has to be compiled into the kernel.
You use append="console=ttyS0,BAUDRATE" in LILO configuration. This
keeps it off the screen.
The stuff written by init, can be eliminated by changing the link
of /dev/console to point to /dev/null instead of /dev/tty0.
