You seem to think that you are telling me something that I
don't know.  As if I have no idea what the difference is between
/dev/{null,full,zero} is.  Do you really think that I am that
confused?  Did the smiley give you any indication?

Is this really considered "useful"?  Obviously someone thinks it is
useful, because it is in the kernel, but I don't see any immediate
applications.  Still, it's easy to code, and doesn't take up much kernel
space.
Merry Christmas.
