Sigh.. yeah it was killing me slowly before and now it's killing me more 
rapidly. Seems I age a year with each patch release. Very occasionally I wish 
I was doing this in daylight hours instead of starting all my hacking at 10pm 
when the family has gone to bed.

Not as frequently as I'd like no. If you can do nice repeatable runs it would 
be very nice of you thanks. I like to spend as much time as I can testing 
them locally on real world usage, and each time I planned to do some 
benchmarking there was always something else I needed to try after others 
responded. 2.6.0-test3-mm2 #85 doesn't even begin to tell you how many 
kernels I've booted. I've almost rebooted enough to install windows.
If you're interested, this is the script I ran for maximum repeatability in 
minimum timespace of the tests that varied a lot. I had a separate ext3 
partition on another hard disk called /ext3 (explains the command)
oops just noticed you cc'ed lkml. ah what the heck I'll cc it as well
