A couple of crash fixes here.
Since 2.5.54-mm1:
+no-stem-compression.patch
 top(1) crashes for me.  Back out the stem compression code while
 it's being sorted out.
-quota-smp-locks.patch
 Merged
page_add_rmap-rework.patch
 Was causing an oops in X startup.   Fixed.
-teeny-mem-limits.patch
-smaller-head-arrays.patch
+#teeny-mem-limits.patch
+#smaller-head-arrays.patch
 Go back to the usual memory reserve levels.
+wli-11_pgd_ctor-update.patch
 Use pgds-from-slab and pmds-from-slab on non-PAE machines too.
