 there has been a bit of confusion on this topic. I think it's 
 now the time to exactly define what should happen with
 alarms and how they should be reported back to the class.
 I'm usually inclined to agree with David on that particular topic :)
 other than that, I would like to remove the /proc interface in the
 future, so users are advised not to count on it and device
 authors to not add properties.
