I just booted 2.2.12 on our news server and got this:
[....]
eth0: Setting full-duplex based on MII #3 link partner capability of 41e1.
Starting system log daemon: syslogd klogd.
kmalloc: Size (4294959124) too large
Setting up IP spoofing protection...done.
Starting base networking daemons: portmap inetd.
Setting NIS domainname to: cistron.nl
[....]
.. and I do not have network connectivity with this kernel. It looks
like the epic100 driver is busted. It's a module, unloading and reloading
gets it to work again ..
Mike.
