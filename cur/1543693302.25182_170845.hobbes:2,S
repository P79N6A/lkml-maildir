Hello Richard, - It seems, that I should be more precise about what I 
exactly mean...
I'm writing a kernel mode device driver (mouse).
In that device driver I need the timestamp of the last event for another 
kernel mode device (keyboard).
I do not care if that timestamp is in jiffies or in gettimeofday() 
format or whatever format does exist in the world. I am absolutely sure 
I can convert it somehow to fit my needs.
But since it is a kernel mode driver it can not -AFAIK- use the signal() 
syscall.
