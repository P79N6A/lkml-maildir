Hi all,
I see in menuconfig I have two options:
<*> Anticipatory I/O scheduler
<*> Deadline I/O scheduler
Help reveals Anticipatory is pretty good, but make a slightly larger kernel - 
Deadline help says it a good alternative to Anticipatory.
But I can build both in... so I guess then the kernel decides what is the best 
to use?  Or should it be so I am only allowed to select one or the other and 
allowing both is an oversight?
Thanks,
Nick
