As for the TX3912 issue, there is no remaining user so that driver would
now be continuing to suffer from accelerated bitrot.  A rewrite to use
the drivers/serial infrastructure is relativly minor and so I and Atushi
Nemoto agree in that the old driver should stay removed, as my patch did
and therefore there was no need for rerolling the patch.  Akpm has in
the meantime sent the patches to Linus, so what's left would be renaming
the driver, as per your suggestion.
