Out of the seven functions marked __devinit, only one is actually
buggy, since only Netmos make both serial as well as serial and
parallel cards.
A problem will only occur if parport_serial registers a Netmos port
and the netmos quirk is marked as __devinit.  The other quirks
never match any parallel port devices, and so will never be called.
Splitting the quirk table into parport_serial doesn't resolve this
issue as far as static analysis goes either.
A better solution would be to fix the device model so that devices
can have more than one driver, so parport_serial doesn't have to
exist.
