So, (trying to salvage something useful from this thread) where can I
download this standard?  Or is it, as I suspect, another toll bridge on
the information highway?  And if so, why do we insist on doing stupid
things like that to ourselves?   And could this have something to do
with the fact that very few C or C++ programmers actually possess
complete and uptodate definitions of the languages?
