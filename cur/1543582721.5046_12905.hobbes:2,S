Btw, this is also going to be a VM and performance issue some time in
the future.  Tgere are already CPU's that would _love_ to have 64kB
pages etc, and as such a filesystem that doesn't play with the old silly
"everthing is a block" rules would be much appreciated with the kind of
people who have multi-gigabyte files and want to read in big chunks at a
time. 
So either you have a simple block-based filesystem (current ext2, no
extents, no crapola), or you decide to do it over.  Don't do some
half-way thing, please.
