Why do you keep breaking my kernel?

That's odd - we lost a printk there:
	printk("BUG: spinlock %s on CPU#%d, %s/%d, %p\n", msg,
		smp_processor_id(), current->comm, current->pid, lock);
which is a shame, because it would have told us stuff.  Do you have any
traces which do have that message?
Anyway, scary trace.  It look like some spinlock is thought to be in the
wrong state in schedule().  Send the .config, please.
