+RT Mutex Subsystem with PI support
+
+RT Mutexes with priority inheritance are used to support pthread_mutexes
+with priority inheritance attributes.
+
+The basic technology was developed in the preempt-rt tree and
+streamlined for the pthread_mutex support.
+
+RT Mutexes extend the semantics of Mutexes by the priority inheritance
+protocol. Sharing code and data structures with the Mutex code is not
+feasible due to the extended requirements of RT Mutexes.
+
+Basic operation principle:
+
+A low priority owner of a rt_mutex inherits the priority of a higher
+priority waiter until the mutex is released. Is the temporary priority
+boosted owner blocked on a rt_mutex itself it propagates the priority
+boosting to the owner of the rt_mutex it is blocked on. The priority
+boosting is immidiately removed once the rt_mutex has been unlocked.
+This technology allows to shorten the blocking on mutexes which
+protect shared resources. Priority inheritance is not a magic bullet
+for poorly designed applications, but allows optimizations in cases
+where the protection of shared resources might affect critical parts
+of an high priority thread.
+
+The enqueueing of the waiters into the rtmutex waiter list is done in
+priority order. In case of the same priority FIFO order is chosen. Per
+rtmutex only the top priority waiter is enqueued into the owners
+priority waiters list. Also this list enqueues in priority
+order. Whenever the top priority waiter of a task is changed the
+priority of the task is readjusted. The priority enqueueing is handled
+by plists, see also include/linux/plist.h for further explanation.
+
+RT Mutexes are optimized for fastpath operations and have no runtime
+overhead in case of locking an uncontended mutex or unlocking a mutex
+without waiters. The optimized fathpath operations require cmpxchg
+support.
+
+The state of the rtmutex is tracked via the owner field of the
+rt_mutex structure:
+
+rt_mutex->owner holds the task_struct pointer of the owner. Bit 0 and
+1 are used to keep track of the "owner is pending" and "rtmutex has
+waiters" state.
+
+owner		bit1	bit0
+NULL		0	0	mutex is free (fast acquire possible)
+NULL		0	1	invalid state
+NULL		1	0	invalid state
+NULL		1	1	invalid state
+taskpointer	0	0	mutex is held (fast release possible)
+taskpointer	0	1	task is pending owner
+taskpointer	1	0	mutex is held and has waiters
+taskpointer	1	1	task is pending owner and mutex has more waiters
+
+Pending ownership is assigned to the first (highest priority) waiter
+of the mutex, when the mutex is released. The thread is woken up and
+can now acquire the mutex. Until the mutex is taken (bit 0 cleared) a
+competing higher priority thread can steal the mutex which puts the
+woken up thread back on the waiters list.
