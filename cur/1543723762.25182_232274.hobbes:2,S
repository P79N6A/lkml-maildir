MAY_PTRACE is defined as:
#define MAY_PTRACE(task) \
        (task == current || \
        (task->parent == current && \
        (task->ptrace & PT_PTRACED) && task->state == TASK_STOPPED))
so, if a process (current) is interested in another process (task) which
is not itself and not one of its children then MAY_PTRACE is 0. and the
test in mem_read() immediately returns ESRCH error without checking
may_ptrace_attach() at all. I questioned this behaviour as being too
restrictive and would like to know the reason for it.
Surely, the super user (i.e. CAP_SYS_PTRACE in this context) should be 
allowed to read any process' memory without having to do the 
PTRACE_ATTACH/PTRACE_PEEKUSER kind of thing which strace(8) is doing?
Kind regards
