Greg,
What about "bind_mode" device and driver attributes? If you are not going
to apply them then I need to rework driver_probe_device to not call 
bus->match() function. The reason is that if bind_mode is not in the core
then I need to check these attributes in serio's bus match function, but
then I will not be able to use driver_probe_device to force binding when
user requests it. And if I don't check bind_mode in serio_bus_match then
I will have to do all driver/device mathing by hand which I wanted to
avoid in the first place.
Please let me know.
