Did you try the -devel version or 1.01?  (I did about an 80% rewrite of this 
sucker after 1.0, but it hasn't shipped yet.  I bounced a 1.1.0-pre1 tarball 
off of Erik and he said he'd put it up today, meanwhile grab the subversion 
snapshot.)
Busybox -devel is way ahead of 1.01.  Hopefully we'll have a new -stable 
release by the end of the year...
