With my proposal the
	#if defined(ARCH_HAS_IRQ_PER_CPU)
	....
	#endif
lets readers of __do_IRQ() immediately grasp:
 "this block might not be compiled / depends an ARCH"
And you'll get compile error's using IRQ_PER_CPU on ie i386,
letting you immediately know,
that you've got to change something to be able to use IRQ_PER_CPU.
That are advantages I think.
Otherwise your proposal is ok for me too.
   Regards,
   Karsten
