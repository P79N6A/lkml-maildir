For disks smaller than 8G, a geometry misdetection would get solved by
just specifying the disk _logical_ geometry at boot.
So it is surely worth a try to do the same on a 10G one.
I suspect 2.0.x might have problems with LBA access mode on such a disk,
yet specifying the disk geometry at boot with
hda=<cyls>,<heads>,<sectors>
where <cyls>,<heads> and <sectors> are the appropriate numbers for your disk
may do the trick.
On the other hand, if you want other OSes to access that disk,
this solution will surely fall short.
