Actually, you do.
_I_ think "." just means "current working directory".
It's not my fault that other systems can't do this, Linux has the
information, and will happily remove the current working directory. I
don't think it's a bug, I think it's just very logical.
Show me POSIX or other standards that say that you can't do it, and I
guess I have to work around a standards problem, but right now I say that
if programs ask for 'rmdir(".")', then they had better get it. I don't
think the OS should second-guess anybody. 
The reason '.' doesn't work on other UNIXes is that they don't have the
complete path information that Linux has.
