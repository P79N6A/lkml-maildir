You may be running into this problem:

I had enourmeous trouble with Via KT133 and IDE.
Placing network card to a different PCI slot helped somewhat as did
upgrading the bios.
I NEVER got the board stable, and ended up ditching it.
It seemed to be a KT133 Northbridge DMA issue. My impression is that KT133
is utter crap period.
When browsing the viaarena.com forums, I found huge number of problem
reports about KT133 corrupting DMA transfers with sound cards, video
editing cards and IDE. It seemed to me it just can't get DMA right when it
is under heavy load. The reports were mostly windows, btw.
