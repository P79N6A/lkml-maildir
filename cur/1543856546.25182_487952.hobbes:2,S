It was the most obvious one at a quick glance.
I would argue that _every single one_ is a small problem because it makes the
code murkier.  Yes we "know" that statics are initialized to zero.  Not every
reader is perfectly versed in that.  The fact that statics and dynamics are
different is an added subtlety.  Everywhere you've removed an initializer is
a potential bug if someone needs to change that variable to a different
storage class.  Yes they "should" know better.

Agreed; that's why it's a compiler/linker bug if _explicit_ initialization to
zero results in any difference in the final binary.  So here you're
submitting dozens of source level changes to repair a toolchain bug.

I agree, it's more than coincidence.  But the new version tells you less.  It
ccertainly _could_ have been coded such that debug == 1 means no debug, 0
means debug.  Dumb, but possible.  It could also have been coded such that
debug == BT_DEBUG_OFF means debug, but that's egregiously stupid.
In other words, I believe the reader of:
  static int bt_debug = BT_DEBUG_OFF;
_knows_ debug is off.  The reader of:
  static int bt_debug = 0;
has a _strong suspicion_ that debug is off.  The reader of:
  static int bt_debug;
has at best a _strong hint_ that debug is off.
Any of those three statements could be shortly followed by:
  bt_debug = BT_DEBUG_ON;
but this would be a moderately surprising construction after the first two;
not at all surprising after the third.
