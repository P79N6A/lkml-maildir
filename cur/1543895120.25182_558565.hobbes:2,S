Assuming he actually said that, I have no doubt that it would
pre-dates by far even the Free Software Definition, let alone the GPL.

Of course not.  That's what the spirit of the GPL is all about.  And
the spirit of the GPL is what the discussion is all about for me.

Exactly!  And since the *Free* *Software* Foundation wrote the
license, and documented the goals in the preamble, referring to
keeping *free* *software* *free*, it is quite safe to say that this
*is* indeed the intent, the spirit of the GPL.

It's not.  freedom and ability have two very different meanings.
Freedom to run the software for any purpose means that people won't
stop you from doing that.  It may take you some work, such as porting
the software, rebuilding it, etc.  But if, at the end of that effort,
you find that it will run on your development machine, but not in a
machine where the original software runs on, and that's because the
manufacturer imposed prohibitions on running unauthorized versions of
the software, then the manufacturer of the hardware is very clearly
disrespecting your freedom #0 WRT that software.
Demanding the ability to run the software for any purpose, without any
effort whatsoever, would indeed be nonsensical.
(BTW, covered work is a legal term, only present in the legal portion
of the license, which I'm actively avoiding, because I'm not a lawyer,
and my point is about the spirit.  but I'm sure I wrote that before
;-)

Sure, but that's a different point.  They could do that with or
without tivoization.
The point is that, if they have an issue with the program in the
device, and they'd like to improve it, but they find that they won't
be able to use their modification to get the device to do what they
want, they're less likely to make the change.
Now multiply this by all customers, and see how much you're losing by
permitting tivoization, assuming that at least some tivoizers would
change their minds towards respecting users' freedoms, if faced with
an anti-tivoization licensing provision.

A distraction doesn't shoot down an argument.

What is the 'agreed' supposed to mean, then? ;-)

You're entitled to have these motivations to release software under
GPLv2, or any other license that you believe furthers these goals.
But you have no say whatsoever on what intent RMS had when he wrote
the GPL, just like he has no say whatsoever on what intent you have
when you choose the GPL for your program.

Others can choose the GPL for other reasons.  There's nothing wrong
with this.
What's wrong is to then complain that the GPL is changing the spirit,
just because the revised version allegedly no longer matches their
reasons.

Again, this is the FSF version of the spirit, the only one that
matters as far as "the spirit of the GPL" is concerned.

See, no "argument shot down" ;-)

It reduces the incentive for these users to collaborate.
Or, if you want to put it in a positive tone, the ability to enjoy and
test their modifications would grow the number of contributors.  More
"giving back in kind".  More tit-for-tat.

I don't think tivoized software qualifies as Free Software any more.
Sure, they still get the sources and that's still Free Software, but
the tivoized binaries aren't.

Because you say so?  Even though you agree with points after claiming
