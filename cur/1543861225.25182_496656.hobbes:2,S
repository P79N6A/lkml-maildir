yep. Not a big issue - what is important is to put the paravirt ops into 
the read-only section so that it's somewhat harder for rootkits to 
modify. (Also, it needs to be made clear that this is fundamental, 
lowlevel system functionality written by people under the GPLv2, so that 
if you utilize it beyond its original purpose, using its internals, you 
likely create a work derived from the kernel. Something simple as irq 
disabling probably doesnt qualify, and that we exported to modules for a 
long time, but lots of other details do. So the existence of 
paravirt_ops isnt a free-for all.)

no. This is fundamental architecture boot code, not module code. kvm.c 
should eventually go into kernel/ and arch/*/kernel, not the other way 
around.

yes - this limit is easily triggered via the KVM/Qemu virtual serial 
drivers. You can think of "kvm_paravirt" as "Linux paravirt", it's just 
a flag.
