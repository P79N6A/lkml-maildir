The basic optimization idea looks interesting. But your implementation
is quite complicated.  
The basic problem is that extern declarations and definitions
are the same macro. If they weren't one could just use a different
macro depending on if MODULE is defined or not and get rid
of the type comparisons you do.
Since you already need to change a lot of the per CPU definitions how
about you just define a separate macro for extern per cpu
declarations? And then change the basic macro to do the right
thing based on MODULE is set or not.
