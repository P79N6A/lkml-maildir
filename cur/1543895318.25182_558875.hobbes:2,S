Yes, that's correct. sh64 supports both a 64-bit and a 32-bit ABI, but in
practice, only the 32-bit is used (both for kernel and user space). While
registers and loads/stores are 64-bits, the pointer size is still 32 when
using the 32-bit ABI. This was the reason for things like ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN.
