Sure you have. You can _always_ change
	(a ? b : c) = d;
to
	tmp = d;
	a ? (b = tmp) : (c = tmp);
which is not pretty, but with some macro abuse it won't be horrible. In 
fact, once you do that, you might as well just do a real "if" statement. 
Especially if you're going to continue to use (less odious) gcc-specific
stuff you can probably automate it fairly well with a replacement that
uses "typeof" and expresstion statements to do that "tmp" variable
properly.
Ie it might be _slightly_ more complex than running a "sed" script over
the sources, but it shouldn't be that much worse.
