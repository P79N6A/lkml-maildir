No, there are two radically different approaches represented in one 
API.  Shadow page tables and direct page tables require different 
abstractions to make them work.  The API is not fake.  It accommodates 
both approaches, and the Xen changes here are pretty much required to 
make direct page tables work.  The shadow side of the equation is not 
vendor specific, in fact, it is used by lhype to make PTE update 
hypercalls.  But only one vendor chose direct page tables, so it appears 
vendor specific, when in fact it is just specific to that design choice.
Adding XenBus hooks to paravirt-ops, for instance, would be vendor 
specific and useless to anyone else.  But that is not the approach which 
has been taken here.
