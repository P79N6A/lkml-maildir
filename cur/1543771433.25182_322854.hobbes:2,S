I guess I'm now more convinced of its need ;)
add:
4. large pages
5. (hopefully) helps with smaller allocations (ie. order 3)
It would really help your cause in the short term if you can
demonstrate improvements for say order-3 allocations (eg. use
gige networking, TSO, jumbo frames, etc).

For some definitions of 'slightly', perhaps :(
Although I can't argue that a buddy allocator is no good without
being able to satisfy higher order allocations.
So in that case, I'm personally OK with it going into -mm. Hopefully
there will be a bit more review and hopefully some simplification if
possible.
Last question: how does it go on systems with really tiny memories?
(4MB, 8MB, that kind of thing).
