I've also had my keyboard lock up a few times lately... It usually
occurs for me when I leave for a few hours with X running.  I am not
sure if it is X-related becuase I run X all the time.  I come back to
the computer and the keyboard is dead.  The mouse is still active and I
can telnet in.  The only thing that seems to bring the keyboard back to
life is a cold boot.  The BIOS doesn't seem to reset it (or cannot).
