Usually, they sell unlicensed OEM versions, which is fine because you
don't need a license to sell CDs once they've legally entered the EU.
If Microsoft itself distributed them to 
Theoretically, the situation is the same in the U.S., but maybe
Microsoft has just better means to enforce the OEM/end user price
discrimination.

Maybe we are all socialist bastards (I doubt it, some of us are too
good at playing capitalist), but it's not our respect or disrespect of
IP laws that makes a difference.  It's things like social security,
mandatory health insurance, etc., which are backed by actual law, not
very limited private-sector initiatives promoting copyleft schemes.

I don't see what's anti-American about free software.  I assume that
being an American encompasses more than promoting a certain, very
narrowly scoped IP-related agenda.  On the contrary, putting free
speech over IP protection is a very American thing, and most Europeans
do not value freedom of speech that high.

I'm not sure if Mr Padilla agrees.

*shrug* You have your own troubles with militias on the far right
(ignoring this WOT thing, which is beyond rational debate anyway).

So what?  The Microsoft monopoly is only a temporary thing.  Breaking
it shouldn't be the highest-ranked item on the FSF's agenda.
Eventually, Microsoft will commit a fatal mistake (or a series of
minor ones) which will seal its fate.  Free software matters in the
long run, and short-term considerations shouldn't alter our course too
much.
