Sorry I assumed when you said clean you implied readonly... Though
we'd need to differentiate the archs where the dirty bit is not set by
the hardware. Overall I'm unsure it worth it. Currently the VM
definitely wouldn't cope with a writeable and clean anonymous page, so
we'd need to change shrink_page_list and try_to_unmap_anon to make it
work. Likely it won't be measurable, so it may be a nice feature to
have from a theoretical point of view, in practice I doubt it matters.
