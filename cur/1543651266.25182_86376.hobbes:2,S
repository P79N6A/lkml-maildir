I have distributed servers in 15 locations, six states, four timezones. In
secure unattended locations like wiring closets. What do I do with the
serial port? Do I double my colocation costs and have another system there
to listen? Is the code on a sick system going to dial the modem on the
serial line amd establish a connection?
I have a mix of Linux, Solaris, and AIX systems deployed, and only the
Linux systems don't have this capability. Actually for the most part only
the Linux systems NEED it, that's another problem, but reliability would
go up if I could see the problem.
