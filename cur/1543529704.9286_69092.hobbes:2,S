Yes, no question at all.  Our 2.2 code has been through much more testing
than the 2.3 port.  Once the testers decide it is stable (with old format 
support as well), I'd like to remove the experimental/beta qualification.
I think the code will be ready for this early in the 2.4 life cycle.
I'm trying to be very up front about what works, and what needs testing.

Certainly reiserfs doesn't die as a project if we miss 2.4.  But, I think
the being in 2.4 will rapidly make it a better filesystem than it could be
as an add on patch.
