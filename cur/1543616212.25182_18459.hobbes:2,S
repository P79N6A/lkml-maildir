Well, as the C standards evolve to incorporate things that gcc earlier
had to create extensions to provide, it is reasonable that gcc, which
after all _is_ a C-compiler (yeah, yeah, I know that gcc is GNU Compiler
Collection or whatever, but disregard from that now, ok?!) should
use those. Deprecating the use of the extension in one release and
removing it from the next is something we do from time to time in the
kernel too...

So, you:
a.) Coded with a lot of gcc specific code
or
b.) Had a lot of bugs in your code that gcc didn't warn about before
In both cases I'd recommend fixing the code...

Huh? Most likely, your code is broken, rather than blaming the
messenger, act properly upon the received message.
