Hi Ingo,
Here's a series which concentrates on unifying and cleaning up
asm-86/page*.h.  Each patch in the series restricts itself to doing
one thing fairly simply, so it should be fairly low-risk and easy to
bisect.
The early version of this patch got rid of asm/page_32|64.h entirely,
but I decided the resulting #ifdef hell was too hard to deal with, so
I moved purely 32/64-bit specific stuff into their own files.
Thanks,
	J
