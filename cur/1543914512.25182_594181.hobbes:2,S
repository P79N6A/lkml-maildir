Peter,
I have been using your -v9 backport to 2.6.22 (thanks very much
btw) for the last few days on an amd64 system configured like this:
 [/],[/home],[/backup],...
  on top of
 [lvm2]
  using
 [/dev/sdb]
  which is an
 [areca hw raid 6 device made up from 8 sata disks]
With your patch, performance was much improved. But still there are
some seemingly simple tasks which do not work well. Like
 cp /home/bigfile.txt /backup/bigfile.txt
or also
 rm -r /backup/big-directory
They both affect disk access times of other processes very badly.
As I said, things improved a quite a bit with your patch, but I wonder
if there is more that could be done for this particular setup?
A second thing. Since my box has 8GB memory, I am intrigued by the
idea of setting dirty_ratio not as a ratio but as an absolute
number of kilobytes as it was suggested by Neil Brown with the
dirty_kb patch a few months back. Would it make sense to forward
port this patch on top of yours ?
cheers
tobi
