It survived the night and is still up. Looks like it runs slightly
faster than 2.4.20-X.

OK.

It's just that the news server uses its own 'filesystem'. It does
normal read/write i/o on it, but the allocation bitmap at the
beginning of the 'file' is mmap()ed. Using a regular file means
creating a 160 GB file, the triple indirect blocks will probably
kill performance.
I guess that means I have to resurrect rawfs, then (a filesystem
I wrote for 2.2 that shows partitions as fixed-size files). But
that seems so .. unnecessary.
