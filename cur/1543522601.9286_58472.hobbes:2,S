What keeps me from supporting the development branch with RSBAC patches:  
For a spare time programmer it is difficult to keep up with the speed of  
changes, e.g. my patch against 2.3.29 failed at about half the places (!)  
in 2.3.33.
I rather wait for the change speed to calm down before porting, ending up  
in mostly supporting stable branches. For me that seems better than  
spending so much time with porting that could be spent with improving the  
feature itself.
So yes, as soon as things get going many patches break and often take much  
time to fix.

It's even worse: I already started #ifdef'ing within the 2.2 branch,  
because otherwise it simply doesn't compile. This means rechecking code  
with older kernel versions within a branch, too.
So there is another choice: As soon as a new stable series starts,  
developer changes over to that, simply skipping the development branches.  
This is not desirable, but much easier to handle.

It would help a lot to have some list of changes, specially when things  
have to be done in a completely different way. Possibly with a how-to for  
upgrading. (No, sorry, I don't have the time myself to document other  
people's code.)
All the changes tend to pile up to a huge amount of porting work - maybe a  
discussion about the features to be added within a development branch  
should be held before feature freeze time...
