Hi Matt,
in the meantime I checked 2.6.8 kernel and this one works fine. There were 
some changes in the interrupt code in in version 2.6.9 I think, so I second 
your opinion that the real problem is not the scsi driver, but some irq 
problems. Other people (on linuxppc-dev@ozlab.org) also noted this.
Unfortunatly, I have no direct access to this machine anymore to do some 
debuging, but I'm sure this will come up again in the (far) future - so be 
warned...
Anyway, thanks for your help
Marc
