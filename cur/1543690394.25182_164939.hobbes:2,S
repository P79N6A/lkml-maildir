You are a magician! Putting in a .subsection to hide the jump
is absolute bullshit. The built-in macros, ".subsection", and
".previous" just made the damn linker do the fixup. You just
did a long jump, out of the current code-stream, into some
other section. Then you jumped back. Hell of an optimization!
Might even reload the cache if you are lucky! Linker tricks
won't work for me. Also, putting some address on the stack
and executing 'ret' emulate a jump won't impress me either.
In any real code, only the last instruction in a procedure
gets to have a jump optimized away. Most of the times you
can't even do that because you need to restore different
stack-levels from different code paths (one reason to use
a frame-pointer, but still not good enough).

Sure do. I love it. I even get paid for this kind of stuff!
