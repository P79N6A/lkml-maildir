Could you fix this part:
+                       /* fill the overlap with single byte nops */ 
+                       memset(a->instr + a->replacementlen, 0x90, 
+                       a->instrlen - a->replacementlen); 
to use an array of replacements, something like
	#define MAXSIZE 6
	char *nop_sizes[MAXSIZE] = {
		NULL,		// "zero sized nop"? I don't think so
		{ 0x90 },	// simple one-byte no-op.
		{ .. whatever the two-byte NOP is .. }
		...
	};
and then have something like
	replace = a->instrlen - a->replacementlen;
	nop = a->instr + a->replacementlen;
	while (replace) {
		int size = replace;
		if (size > MAXSIZE)
			size = MAXSIZE;
		memcpy(nop, nop_sizes + size, size);
		nop += size;
		replace -= size;
	}
instead? I think it's silly to have multiple single-byte nops, when there
are well-defined multi-byte nops available.
Other than that this looks pretty good.
