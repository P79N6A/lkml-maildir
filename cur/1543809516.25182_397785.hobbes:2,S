Correct, because setup_arch() itself doesn't have _any_ SMP awareness at
all - only the platform code knows about that.  Hence, we initialise it
in smp_prepare_cpus(), which is a platform specific function.

I think that's what we'll have to do, and then later on clear it and
re-populate it with the correct bitmask.  Grumble.
