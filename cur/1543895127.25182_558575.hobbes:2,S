Ok, can I please rewrite my argument to:
"The hardware manufacturer has built a custom BIOS and also written
Linux kernel support for said BIOS.  They have released the kernel
drivers under GPL as required, but have not released the code to the
BIOS, instead just releasing the interface documentation.  The BIOS
didn't exist before, and as they only intend to run Linux on the
device, the BIOS design was heavily influenced around working well
with Linux."
Actually, we don't know that last bit, maybe they created the BIOS
in a total vacuum and then wrote the Linux kernel driver later.
Maybe not.
Anyway, I think I've wound up arguing two sides of the same argument,
oops.
Bron.
