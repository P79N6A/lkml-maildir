Hi David,
thank you very much for taking time to revise the code 
and for the detailed comments.
|  The amount of code duplication is absolutely enormous and
|  totally unnecessary.
You are right. 
So far I thought it better to keep UDP and UDP-Lite separate but an
intelligent code integration does seem the better way.
<snip>
|  It's mostly clerical work, but it will mean that we will have one
|  copy of all this code and as a result we won't even need a config
|  option for UDP-Lite.
I will start with the v4-side and post a small RFC patch to see whether
I got the concepts right. (Due to vacation, this will not before mid/end 
of August.)
Best regards
Gerrit
