Silly Q: I tried to mount a vfat floppy the other day and couldn't, 
will this patch also fix that?

I'll go get it and see if it will apply. If not, then it probably 
should be redone against the 10-rc2 tree and republished.
Now a couple of hours later (I got sidetracked) & saved this in 
drafts...
Well, it did apply to 2.6.10-rc2, and I'm running it now.  Without the 
arguements on the kernel command line in grub.conf.
ACPI is still very noisy in dmesg though.  But nothing to report in 
the way of errors, it just does a lot of chattering.  Great for 
debugging no doubt.
Now, lets see if I can mount a vfat floppy disk, that was a problem 
before.
Yup, works as expected now, thanks a bunch.
Sane still works, tvtime still works, xmms still plays oggs, kde is 
running fine, I'm a happy camper again.
