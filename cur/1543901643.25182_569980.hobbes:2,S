Tape block sizes up to 16 MB have been possible for a very long time but 
this has required tuning of the block/scsi parameters. Very few people 
seem to have done this and the common (mis)belief seems to be that the 
tape block size limit has been 512 kB. It is good if this tuning is not
needed in future.
