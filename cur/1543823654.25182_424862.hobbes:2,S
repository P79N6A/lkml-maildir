Hi List!
I am still having problems with rtl8150.c on Linux 2.4.32 ...

You were right :-) It was a question of how things get initialized.
My current state is that I am able to load the module but using my
async_get_register function does not succeed due to timeouts. I am no
kernel hacker and therefore it is like running through the darkest night
with my sunglasses on :-) ... I sincerely hope, the maintainer of the
driver helps me out...
It is interesting to see that with a 2.4.20 kernel I have no problems
with loading the driver, it only crashes when I run net-snmp on it and
then fire up an snmpwalk (which, I guess, queries the driver for some
interface statistics or something like that).
Deadline is coming and still no hope, yet. We'll see...
Kind regards,
Heiko
