Okay, I have an idea:
Let's name attributes with mWh units as {min_,max_,design_,}energy,
and attributes with mAh units as {min_,max_,design_,}charge.
Because both energy and charge represents ""capacity"" in some meanings,
and that's why we bothering with _units attribute. So, lets drop
"capacity"* and use more specific terms? I really don't want string
attributes by default (except status).
If we export attributes with predefined units, userspace developers
could just look into include/linux/battery.h and conclude: "Ah, great,
if battery reporting energy, then it's in mWh, and if battery reporting
charge it's always in mAh".
* Yup, I've read last discussion regarding batteries, and I've seen
  objections against "charge" term, quoting Shem Multinymous:
  "And, for the reasons I explained earlier, I strongly suggest not using
  the term "charge" except when referring to the action of charging.
  Hence:
  s/charge_rate/rate/;  s/charge/capacity/"
  But lets think about it once again? We'll make things much cleaner
  if we'll drop "capacity" at all.
> That said, you may need to use uWh and uAh instead of mAh and mWh, though.
Not sure. Is there any existing chip that can report uAh/uWh? That is
great precision.
