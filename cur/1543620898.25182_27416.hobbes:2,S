On Amiga (m68k and PPC) we have a `debug=mem' option that will write all kernel
messages to a 256 KiB block (marked with a magic number) of Chip RAM. If the
system crashes early, you can reboot into AmigaOS and run a special utility
that finds the 256 KiB block (Chip RAM is not completely erased on reboot) and
extracts the messages.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
