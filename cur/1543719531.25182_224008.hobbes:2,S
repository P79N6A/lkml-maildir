Subject: 2.6.7-rc2 mismatched preempt count in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c

2.6.7-rc2 (and earlier) arch/i386/kernel/irq.c::do_IRQ() calls
irq_exit() which expands into preempt_enable_no_resched(), amongst
others.  With CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, preempt_enable_no_resched() does
dec_preempt_count().  Where is the corresponding inc_preempt_count?
AFAICT the use of preempt_enable_no_resched() is unbalanced.
