Looks good to me. [I just scanned it...]
Perhaps it compat_ptr_u32(arg), that returns (u32 __user *) should be
invented? [Well, its used only 3 times, so maybe this is bad idea].
Also __u32 should not be used here, it looks too ugly and u32 is
okay. Same for __u16 and __u64. Its simple search&replace, and as you
are doing lots of changes, anyway....
