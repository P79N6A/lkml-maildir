I can see two conflicting desires in this discussion, the desire to 
continue
development to avoid patch backlog, and the desire to slow down and 
stabilize
to provide a sane release-candidate and release scheme.  Could the two
desires somehow be both resolved simultaneously?
Perhaps instead of forking when 2.6.A is released, Linux could fork 
earlier,
after the 2.6.A-bk series.  After the fork, the main tree would become 
the
new 2.6.A+1-bk, and the forked tree would become 2.6.A+1-pre.  Then the 
final
stabilization and patches could continue while normal kernel development
moves on.  The latest kernel could take advantage of patches to the 
release
kernel, but would be able to maintain the steady patch stream.  The 
release
kernel could be managed by the previously mentioned "sucker", and could 
go
through a more-stabilizing and better tested Release Candidate series, 
and
then maintain post-release bugfixes.  When 2.6.A+1-pre is released, then
all upstream development on the forked 2.6.A-post tree would cease.
Cheers,
