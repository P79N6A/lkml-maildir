All bh are not reentrant in respect of all other bh. You can't have two bh
_handlers_ running at the same time.

The first thing that came me in mind if I would in you, would be to do an
hack and force the irq handler (or the apic_timer_interrupt in SMP) to
run_task_queue(&multi_thread) a new task queue that will going to race
with the bh handlers. I think it's not stuff for 2.2.x and I am not sure
my fastest thought is the best way to handle the multithread taskqueue
thing.
BTW, I hope I am not missing something in my thoughts... ;)
