Dear all,
	I experience an USB lockup since I upgrade my kernel from 2.4.19-pre6
to 2.4.19-pre7. The problem seems to be caused by the correction of
is_suspended variable initialsation in /driver/usb/uhci.c which may the
suspend code actually runs. I don't know why my USB doesn't wake up
after suspended. 
	I have tested with 2.5.26 and all works fine.
Regards,
Jacky
