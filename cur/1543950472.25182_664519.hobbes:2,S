Well, we use the version info to know if we can request EDID data, but
otherwise I don't see any VBE2 stuff in vesa_general_info used.
A VBE2+ compatible BIOS should still put the correct version number in
the VBE info block even if you don't request VBE2 data (E.G. the
version gets set to 3.0 independently of VBE2 or not in the disasm I
sent).

Great. This was how the old asm version used to do it as well.
