This is not a good practice though because it will attempt to unmap
device that is not mapped. Depeneding on changes in kmap code (for
example adding checks for regions being busy) blindly calling unmap
could unmap some other cdev. For dynamically allocated objects calling
kobject_put(&cdev->kobj) would be more correct but not very nice.
