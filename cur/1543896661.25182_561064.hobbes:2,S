The threat "model" you describe above is a subset of what SELinux
addresses.  And our argument is that AA does not meet that model well,
because it relies upon ambiguous and unstable identifiers for subjects
and objects (a violation of the fundamental requirements for access
control) and because it provides very incomplete mediation.

:
The Security-enhanced Linux's new features are designed to enforce the
separation of information based on confidentiality and integrity
requirements. They are designed for preventing processes from reading
data and programs, tampering with data and programs, bypassing
application security mechanisms, executing untrustworthy programs, or
interfering with other processes in violation of the system security
policy. They also help to confine the potential damage that can be
caused by malicious or flawed programs. They should also be useful for
enabling a single system to be used by users with differing security
authorizations to access multiple kinds of information with differing
security requirements without compromising those security requirements.
