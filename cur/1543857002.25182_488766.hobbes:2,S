no, that's not all we get - we should also get a stackdump. Are you not 
getting a stackdump perhaps?
but i agree with you in theory that your proposed output is better, but 
the side-effect issue is a killer i think. Could you try to rework it to 
not evaluate the condition twice and to make it dependent on 
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE? You can avoid the evaluation side-effect issue 
by doing something like:
	int __c = (c);							\
                                                                        \
        if (unlikely(__c)) {                                            \
                if (debug_locks_off())                                  \
                        WARN_ON(__c);                                   \
                __ret = 1;                                              \
