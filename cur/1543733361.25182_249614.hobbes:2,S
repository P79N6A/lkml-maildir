Andreas,
I really like the patch - I wanted to do quite the same so thanks that you
saved me some work ;-)

I'd prefer to have the algorithms grouped by "type" ("cipher", "digest",
"compress")? Then the apps could easily see only the algos that thay are
interested in...

There could eventually be a separate crypto/sysfs.c, couldn't?

Few notes:
- - some algorithms allow only discrete set of keysizes (e.g. AES can do
128b, 192b and 256b). Can we instead of min/max have a file 'keysize' with
either:
	minsize-maxsize
or
	size1,size2,size3
?
- - ditto for blocksize?
- - With the future support for hardware crypto accelerators it
might be possible to have more modules loaded providing the same
algorithm. They may have different priorities and one would be treated as
"default". Then I expect the syntax of 'module' file to change from a
simple module name to something like:
	# modname:prio:type:whatever
	aes:0:generic:
	aes_i586:1:optimized:
	padlock:2:hardware:default
But for now there is probably nothing to do about it.
