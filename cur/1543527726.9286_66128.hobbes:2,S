You are right.  I just tried some examples with GCC 2.95.1 using C and
C++, and they both inline the value of a const int, if it is defined.
I am fairly confident that when I read the first edition of Stroustrup's
book, the use of "const int" to declare constants was touted as a C++
feature, as a key difference from C which required preprocessor macros
to get equivalent results.
So I'm puzzled.
