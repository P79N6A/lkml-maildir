Fuse needs to use get_user_pages() to work around certain deadlock
scenarios (see Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt), that are
problematic with copy_*_user().
Other possibilities for dealing with these kinds of deadlocks are:
  1) detect deadlock before it happens
  2) copy data to a temporary buffer before copying to userspace
I think 1) is basically impossible.  2) is easy and would save a lot
of complexity, but it would certainly be much slower than the current
approach, especially for the mainstream architectures, where the
dcache aliasing problem doesn't exist.

Yes, note the flush_dcache_page() call in fuse_copy_finish().  That
could be replaced by the flush_kernel_dcache_page() (added by James
Bottomley together with flush_anon_page()) when all relevant
architectures have defined it.

Yes, I think that was the concept.

This is only problematic if multiple threads are touching the same
page, no?  If the page(s) used for reading/writing requests are
exclusive to each thread, then there should be no problem.  This is a
reasonable requirement towards the userspace filesystem I think.

Note again, fuse is not the only user of get_user_pages().  Other uses
are just as prone to these issues.
