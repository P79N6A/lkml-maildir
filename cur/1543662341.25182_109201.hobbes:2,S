For the second time in a week, I agree with HCH: If you are developing 
an LSM module, then by all means please make it publicly known. Whether 
we host your source or not, we want to at least link to your site from 
http://lsm.immunix.org/lsm_modules.html
WRT "taking away LSM patches": HCH wants to remove hooks that "no one 
uses" and also complains about LSM being a big ugly undesigned hack 
lacking abstraction. LSM does have an abstract design: it mediates 
access to major internal kernel objects (processes, inodes, etc.) by 
user-space processes, throwing access requests out to the LSM module. If 
you remove some of these hooks because they don't have a *present* 
module using them, then you break the abstraction.
People tell me that preserving functionality for the sake of abstraction 
is "not the Linux way". Ok, sure, but you degrade the quality of 
abstraction if you aggressively prune the interface.
But it would be much better to short-circuit that debate, and have 
extant modules that use the hooks than to try to defend them on the 
basis of abstraction. So if your sekrit module uses a hook, post here, 
or your hook may go away.
