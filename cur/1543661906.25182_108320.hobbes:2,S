By actually going and reading the drivers to see why the errors occur
and if they are meaningful. You need to know the possible returns and
the intent of those returns.
Eg radio-cadet request region appears not be a cast problem but a
complete misunderstanding of the return codes. Likewise epca it looks
like the board.port/board.membase are just overbroad checks and in fact
harmless.
