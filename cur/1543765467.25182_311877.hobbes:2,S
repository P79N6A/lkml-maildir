That routine is disabled by default (as with the SPNEGO one) so it has 
not gotten much attention, it will probably go away or be significantly 
changed when someone goes through and collapses the four SessionSetup 
cases (currently each a distinct large function with only the default 
NTLM SessionSetup enabled by default) down to smaller functions with 
invoke some common functions.   A good time to do this would be when a 
SessionSetupOldStyle routine is added to handle pre-Windows NT4 
SessionSetup (OS/2, LAN Server, LAN Manager etc.).   Another possibility 
for a good time to update these routines is when SPNEGO support is 
finished - the SPNEGO SessionSetup (which is also too big a function) 
will change a lot (and get simpler) if Andrew Bartlett's idea of an 
upcall to the ntlm_auth utility (the man page is somewhat out of date 
from the better Samba 4 version of this see  
http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/ntlm_auth.1.html
 but it gives the 
general idea)  is done for that case - so that might be a good time to 
redo the session setup routines.
NTLMSSP authentication protocol is interesting (and the Davenport guys 
did a great job updating the documentation for it - see  
http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html
) and I would like to 
implement some of the cool optional features as I get time.
