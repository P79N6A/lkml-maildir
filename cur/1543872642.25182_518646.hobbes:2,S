But TFD_TIMER_SEQ is a simple auto-rearm case of TFD_TIMER_REL. So the 
timespec is sufficent too (in all three cases we just need *one* time). 
Actually, the only place where I can find the itimerspec usefull, is 
indeed with TFD_TIMER_SEQ. In cases where you want you clock starting at a 
given time (it_value) *and* with the given frequency (it_interval).
