We have something vaguely similar in the Fedora package (I think it's
only in the CVS tree rather than in the SRPM itself, but the CVS tree is
public too).

*checkout*/rpms/kernel/devel/merge.pl?rev=1.9
It doesn't do quite what you asked for -- it works with 'incremental'
configuration. So any options specified in _any_ form in the second
config are overridden in the output. It lets us start with a generic
config, then apply options (turning stuff both on and off) for PowerPC
in general, and then for specific builds on top of that.
