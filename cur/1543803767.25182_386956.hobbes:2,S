There is no such thing as "outside the size of the symbol".  kallsyms
does not save symbol size, it is calculated as the difference between
this symbol and the next one in the table.  By definition, every size
is correct - as long as all symbols are in the table.
Some symbols are omitted from kallsyms, which makes the calculation of
"symbol size" wrong for some symbols, those symbols appear bigger than
they really are.  Printing the symbol size was done years ago as a hint
to the reader, it told them what the kernel thought the symbol size was
and gave them something to check against.  That was when there were
very few symbols in the kernel, so most size calculations were wrong.
Nowadays it is probably irrelevant.
