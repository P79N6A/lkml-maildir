People would happily pay millions for this.
Tim has probably heard of Grape?
I don't know whether grape uses FPGAs or not, but take a look at the
photo down the bottom of this:
http://grape.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~fukushig/paper/sc96/sc96.html
I reckon if we could put an accelarator card in each of our 200 new
machines, that could be programmed on the fly to do N-body
calculations, or then changed to do SPH, or whatever, and we only had
to pay $500 per card, and it doubled performace, we'd do it in a
second. Half the number of computers, drop energy consumption (and
cooling), etc. It'd be great.
