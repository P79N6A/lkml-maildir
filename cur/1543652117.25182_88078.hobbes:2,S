I'd actually rather change the calling convention, and say that the only 
valid test is for testing the return value "being in range".
And it's not strictly even a calling convention _change_ - it's always
been that way. See the original user, ie the minix filesystem:
	if ((j = minix_find_first_zero_bit(bh->b_data, 8192)) < 8192) {
		...
and it's really a documentation fix/update to just tell people about this.
