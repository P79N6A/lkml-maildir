*nod* Woiuld this also cause the kernel to hang? Last time this happened
it was on a small 256MB partition that holds 13 files (it's /var/mail)

Not sure which one it was this time but the two possibilities are 1.2GB
and 197MB. It does this on either partition.

197MB: 2728 files
1.2GB: 53707 files

256MB
