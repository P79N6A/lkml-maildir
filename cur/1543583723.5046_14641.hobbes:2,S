OK, my bad... By replacing the call I made with this:
        u32     dummy, a, b, c, d;
        if (apm_bios_call(APM_FUNC_IDLE, 0, 0, &dummy, &a, &b, &c, &d))
                return 0;
then the situation is back to "normal"...
Just one more thing though: in apm_bios_call_simple():
[...]
    APM_DO_SAVE_SEGS;
    {
        int cx, dx, si;
[...]
Aren't cx, dx and si really meant to be u32?
