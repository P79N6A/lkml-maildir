| The "stable" part.
I guess I'm still confused by some of what I consider contradictory
remarks by Linus at the kernel summit, and the lack of a summary of
that particular kernel summit session (other than on lwn.net).
I think that we have only a stable kernel and not a development
kernel series now, and that's a loss.  But it's a loss either way
that we toss & turn it...

Some bounded time would be good, yes.  Would have been good for pwc also,
although Nemosoft has had 4 years to move the kernel decompression to
userspace afaik, so it seems that he has taken way too long to get
that done.
