"localhost" is wrong.  Either copy or set it to the value from
system initialization time.

I think this needs to happen on a pure subsystem basis as we merge the
patches.

Agreed.  But we can't always count on everything having a useful state
that we can modify from the inside.  So it is important to leave the
option open at least for those case.
And again there is always the idea that by adding flags we will
transform fork or fork+exec into a spaghetti system call.  I think
that is a reasonable concern.
Also there is always the danger that we run out of clone flags.

Largely it connects to the super chroot usage where you have one
sysadmin he has multiple daemons each running in their own environment
for isolation purposes.  Nothing is installed in the chroot so an
attacker that gets in cannot do anything.

Actually I don't although that could be trivial.  But it is the
wrong split.  The problem is that it is a lock with global effect.
