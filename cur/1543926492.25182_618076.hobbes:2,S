There are a couple of things I don't understand on this one.  And I 
presume you thought the other two bug fixing patches I sent before this 
were OK to go, since on my system

Um ... I fixed the whitespaces I detected from the first round with 
checkpatch.pl.  Then for good measure
I ran checkpatch.pl on the patches, then pasted the files directly into 
the emails.  No problems detected.
And I also just tried checkpatch.pl on the "sent" folder copy.  No 
problems detected there.
Where was the whitespace?  Was it in the patches? Would you mind showing 
me the output so I can do a better job in the future?

What locking change?  I didn't change how locking works in 
read_persistent_clock at all.
I did introduce cpu_relax() because if anyone else ever calls from a hot 
path, that would be good practice and its' one line.

I presume time_64.c and time_32.c will be unified at some point, 
discarding time_64.c.  There's no arch-specific reason to be separate.  
The current time_32.c depends on a different nmi path (that does some 
weird stuff saving and restoring the CMOS index register!), and I didn't 
dare usurp your long-term plan to unify architectures.  But a simple 
cleanup here makes sense, lest someone copy the bad technique as if it 
were good.
