Subject: [slightly OT] dvdrecord 0.3.1 -- and yes, dev=/dev/cdrom works ;)

Slightly OT, but I think it's about time to work on a solution rather than the 
flamewar. ;)
I've just released dvdrtools 0.3.1 
(
http://www.arklinux.org/projects/dvdrtools/
). It is a fork of cdrtools that 
(as the name indicates) adds support for writing to DVD-R and DVD-RW disks 
using purely Free Software, that tries to do things the Linux way ("dvdrecord 
dev=/dev/cdrom whatever.iso") without suggesting to use 2.4 kernels or even 
other operating systems, uses a standard make system, is maintained in a 
public svn repository, and does away with a lot of the libc 
functionality-clones found in cdrtools.
There are a lot more things to do to get CD/DVD writing where it should (and 
could) be -- if anyone else is interested in fixing the CD/DVD situation, 
you're more than welcome to join our team.
Best regards,
bero
