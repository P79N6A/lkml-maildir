Probably wasn't the best mailing list, as this bug affects all
developers and testers..  But whatever - thanks.

Rather than cooking up a private implementation I think it would be
better to implement a kernel-wide mod64_u64() (?) facility and then to
use that in KVM.  There will presumably be other sites which will (or
already do) need such a thing.
However it'll probably be a bit hard, getting the signednesses of the
args and the return value right.
