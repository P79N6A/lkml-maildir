Thanks for this explanation, I see the point. Removing the uio irq
handler will leave the irq chain only with "not for me" devices. In
that case, would it make sense to install a replacement uio handler
that says "yes, that's mine" [but ignoring it since userspace has not
yet finished with it]? (I think I've gotten into a loop since that
would be the IRQ_HANDLED case.) Mh, delicate problem.
