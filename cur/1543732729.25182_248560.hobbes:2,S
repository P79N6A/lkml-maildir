Can that patch be downloaded somewhere to patch against 2.6.8.1? I don't
have any tapping support for my synaptic touchpad on my compaq laptop after
switching from 2.4 to 2.6.
It seems that most of the patches at 
http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/input/2_6_7/
are already in 2.6.8.1: Just the tapping stuff seems to be missing. And
I can't extract your patch from the 2.6.9-rc1-mm2 stuff, because it seems
to be mixed with some other patches there.
Is there a sole version of this patch fir 2.6.8.1 somewhere?
cu,
Frank
