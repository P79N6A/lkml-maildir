Isn't what you're proposing just making more simpler the same thing one
could already do today by a smart analysis of the log message contents ?
Explanation: Looking at a merge changeset log, one can split the log
into parts and then search from the set of files containing deltas in
this changeset the ones having each message part. Based on that, 
individual sub-patches can be reconstruct. Yeah, it is prone to errors
if log messages are identical, but it would probably work most of the
time.
I still fail to see how one could get the sub-patches from changes
happening to *a same file*, like I was asking previously. Or is this
part what you call 'the 4% loss' ?
This isn't theoretical at all, it's very practical: suppose I have to
make several changes to, let's say, drivers/usb/Makefile. There are
several logical changes so I make a couple of incremental patches, just
like the kernel developers like.
I send those patches to Greg KH, he puts them into BK, and later on
Linus pulls from this tree. My changes go into the Linus tree using
a BK branch, and finally get exported to CVS as _a single delta_.
Now, suppose one of my patches introduced a problem. How can someone
not using BK isolate the patch which introduced the problem ? All he
can do is to back out the entire set of patches, and the whole point
of having split the patch initialy into logical changes is lost.
