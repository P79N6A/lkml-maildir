And some don't, like NFS.
Basically, if a filesystem is using "generic_file_mmap()" (and most of
them are), then the issue is whether the filesystem has a bmap() entry for
the inode or not, and bmap is designed for block-aligned usage. Some fs's
(msdos) have a special smap function to do "sector mapping" rather than
block mapping.

Wrong.
It works perfectly fine on NFS. NFS doesn't use the block mpping stuff at
all, and can map stuff at any offset.
