That's defective. Users will not like it.

People use the procps tools to kill processes.
Bad data leads to bad decisions.

Nice! Checking for satisfiability is only NP-complete...
I do get your point, but I expect to see more /proc files
as time passes. Also, there is the issue of maintainability.
Example 1: It has crossed my mind to add separate files
for the least security-critical data, so that an SE Linux
system with moderate security could provide some minimal
amount of basic info to normal users.
Example 2: There could be files containing only data
that is easy to generate or that needs the same locking.
Even with the "ps -o pid" example given, opening /proc/*/stat
is required to get the tty. Opening /proc/*/status is nearly
required; one can do stat() on the directory to get that
via st_uid though.
