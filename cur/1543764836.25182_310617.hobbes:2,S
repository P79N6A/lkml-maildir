I am finishing breaking it up in small bits so you can take a look
at it. Should be finished tomorrow noon (PST).

Yep. It is kind of easy to do (at least in fusyns)--it is just a
matter of setting the priority of the lock, that sets the priority
of its list node.
Because the promotion code only cares about the priority of the
list node, it blends automatically in the whole scheme. The PI
code will modify the list node's priority while promoting all the
tasks affected in the ownership chain, only when the fulocks/mutexes
are PI. The PP code will modify the priority of the fulock/mutex's
list node with an special call. 
[you can check for my 2004 OLS paper for a deeper explanation, or
I can extend this one, if you want]. 
>i.e. this doesnt seem to really affect the core design of RT mutexes.
Nope it doesn't. As I said, it is done in such a way that no 
modifications are needed.

Not really. Deadlock check is needed on PI, so it can be done at the
same time (you have to walk the chain anyway). In any other case, it
is an option you can request (or not).
