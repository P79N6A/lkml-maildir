It is a battle tactic.
Backing out this patch (from a kernel roughly similar to 2.5.66-mm3)
does not resolve the problem:
        [23:08:36]root@phantasy:~# rpm -q glibc
        rpmdb: unable to join the environment
        error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily unavailable
        error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - Resource temporarily unavailable (11)
        error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
        package glibc is not installed
        [23:10:57]root@phantasy:~# LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 rpm -q glibc
        glibc-2.3.2-11.9
If I boot a kernel without NPTL the problem goes away.  The problem also
does not exist in Red Hat 9's 2.4 kernel (which has NPTL).
When I first started tracking this down, I found an rpm version where
everything worked... like rpm-4.2-0.41 or so.  I am currently running
rpm-4.2-0.69 which experiences the problem.
It only happens with root, by the way.  I guess because non-root users
cannot do much, and everything they do do they do without getting a lock
on the db.
Baffling.
