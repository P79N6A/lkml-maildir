It doesn't. But it definitely doesn't need swiotlb either.
Normally swiotlb doesn't even try to bounce when dma mask is <= end_pfn
so something must be very wrong in your kernel. It definitely isn't
a mainline kernel. If this happens in Xen then Xen just needs fixing --
it should not try to bounce when the normal kernel wouldn't.
