This situation is a general description that actually fits what TiVO has done. 
The difference in the TiVO case is that you (and everyone that thinks like 
you - ie: believes that the "tivoization" language in GPLv3 is good) 
equate "replace entirely" with "modification" when, in fact, the two are 
entirely separate acts.

"You can't impose further restrictions on the user's ability to modify what 
*that* software does."
I don't see how TiVO has done this. They have placed no restrictions on 
*modification* at all. What they have done is placed a restriction on 
*REPLACEMENT* of the program. If you're going to argue that "replacement == 
modification" then it is an *easy* argument to make that every time someone 
*replaces* linux with a proprietary system the proprietary system magically 
becomes GPL'd.
And no, this isn't a logical fallacy on my part. It's on your part - all I've 
done is take the logic you have provided and extend it to cover a different 
situation.
