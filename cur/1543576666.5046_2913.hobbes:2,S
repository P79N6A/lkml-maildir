Hi everyone.
Solving other things, I have realized that all that problem on fast
CC detection (CCFOUND) is easily solved by doing:
	CC  := $(.................)
instead of
	CC = $(.........)
The find of the suitable CC command is repeated many times along a 
kernel build. And CC is not anything that can change along a kernel
build. So former syntax solves all the problems, CC detection can
be so complex as you want because is done only once.
Same is valid for other Makefile variables:
CPP = $(CC) -E ===> CPP := $(CC) -E
(If you want to test how many shells are spawned when using CC, try
CC  = $(shell echo "===== CC EVAL ===============" >&2; if ........
vs
CC  := $(shell echo "===== CC EVAL ===============" >&2; if .......
Is there something I am missing ?
