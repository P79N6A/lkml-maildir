But this gets you lowest common denominator sizes for the whole
volume, which is basically the buffer head approach, chop all I/O up
into a chunk size we know will always work. Any sort of nasty  boundary
condition at one spot in a volume means the whole thing is crippled
down to that level. It then becomes a black magic art to configure a
volume which is not restricted to a small request size.
