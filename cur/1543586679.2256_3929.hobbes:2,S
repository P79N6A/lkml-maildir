Since 2.2.4-ac28 and 2.4.3 I keep on getting processes in D state that I
cannot kill, usually mozilla or nautilus which use a large amount of RAM.
Today is galeon:
A ps -eo pid,stat,pcpu,nwchan,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o args shows the
following:
11520 D     0.0 105db1 down_write_failed /usr/bin/galeon-bin
This didn't happen neither with 2.4.2 nor with 2.4.3-pre7; I'm not sure
about pre8.
