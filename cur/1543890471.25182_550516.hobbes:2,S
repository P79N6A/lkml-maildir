Why do you need vma_migratable for the CONFIG_MIGRATION case? The use of 
vma_migratable in a !NUMA sitation would not be working right as far as I 
can tell.
#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
is fine.

Why do you need sys_move_pages for the non-NUMA case?
The low level function that I intended to be used by defrag is 
migrate_pages and that one is outside of #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA.
