Subject: Serial driver - overrun possible to overrun flip buffer? (2.4.0-test7)

While working on a serial driver for AMBA-style serial ports (an ARM
special thing), and I've just spotted an overrun bug in the overrun
code of the 16x50 serial driver:
	if (*status & UART_LSR_OE) {
		/*
		 * Overrun is special, since it's
		 * reported immediately, and doesn't
		 * affect the current character
		 */
		tty->flip.count++;
		tty->flip.flag_buf_ptr++;
		tty->flip.char_buf_ptr++;
!		*tty->flip.flag_buf_ptr = TTY_OVERRUN;
		if (tty->flip.count >= TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE)
			goto ignore_char;
	}
At the marked line (! - line 647), what if flip.count is equal to
TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE?  Surely we're writing to a character outside the
flag_buf_ptr array?  If that is the case, should we not move this
like until after the "goto ignore_char"?  Also, does it matter that
we don't place a character in the character buffer at the overrun
position?
Hmm, I wonder how many other serial drivers have this bug in. ;(
