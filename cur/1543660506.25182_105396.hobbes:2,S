I have not been paying any attention to the I/O scheduler changes for a
couple of months, so I can't say exactly what caused this.  Possibly Nick's
batch expiry logic which causes the scheduler to alternate between reading
and writing with fairly coarse granularity.

OK...  
I _have_ been paying attention to the IO scheduler for the past few days. 
-mm5 will have the first draft of the anticipatory IO scheduler.  This of
course is yielding tremendous improvements in bandwidth when there are
competing reads and writes.
I expect it will take another week or two to get the I/O scheduler changes
really settled down.  Your assistance in thoroughly benching that would be
appreciated.
