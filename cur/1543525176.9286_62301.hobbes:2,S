Agreed --- the freepages thresholds are primarily there for atomic
requests, and those usually come from the normal zone.
However, we still want to allow some hysteresis between page allocations
and the page stealer so that we're not continually waking up kswapd just
to get a single page back.  The old behaviour where we disable kswapd
once freemem goes up to the low-watermark and only reenable it once it
gets to the mid-watermark handles that side of things well.  It's
probably less important to give the user control over those thresholds
than it is for the GFP_ATOMIC thresholds, though.
