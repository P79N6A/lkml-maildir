	Will this be true for wakeups which are triggered from 
expiring timers also? The timers on the dead CPU are migrated to other CPUs. 
When they fire, the timer fn runs on a different CPU and can try to wake up a
task 'n add it to dead cpu! So we probably need a unconditional cpu_is_offline
check in try_to_wake_up?
