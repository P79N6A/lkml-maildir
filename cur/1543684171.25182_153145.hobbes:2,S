If your corruption is only under DMA you have a chipset or an ./arch/
problem.  If you have corruption under PIO, this could be a timing error.
If command mode of taskfile is at issue, you can not function period.
If this only happens on writes, you have a FIFO problem in the ASIC or
iotable for the scatter gather formation.
Taskfile is not broken, it is the only means to talk to an ATA/ATAPI/SATA
device.  How Taskfile is executed is dependent on the device attached.
So if this is the x86-64 issue you have to fix that arch.
