Subject: USB_UHCI hangs with Thinkpad A31 in 2.6.1-rc1

With the 2.6.0 kernel, my Microsoft Notebook USB mouse does not recover from
APM suspend. The light on the backside stays dark. /var/log/messages says:
Dec 31 20:43:37 laptop kernel: usb 2-1: control timeout on ep0out
but this works in the 2.4 kernels. With -rc1, the system locked solid when the
usb_uhci driver got modprobed. No keyboard input, no disk activity, and when
re-inserting the USB mouse (which is enabled by BIOS at reset), the light
remained dark.  I saw the first 3 or 4 lines about detected hubs before it
froze, but I don't have those lines in my system logs.  I only remember they
were very similar to lines from my 2.6.0:
Jan  2 09:57:01 laptop kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: UHCI Host Controller
Jan  2 09:57:01 laptop kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: irq 10, io base 00001820
Jan  2 09:57:01 laptop kernel: uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 2
Here's what lspci -v has to say about the controllers:
00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #1) (rev 02) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
        Subsystem: IBM ThinkPad A/T/X Series
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at 1800 [size=32]
And two more near-identical entries with IRQ10, io-port 1820 and IRQ10, 1840.
My kernel config's enabled USB options are as follows:
CONFIG_USB=y
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD=m
CONFIG_USB_HID=m
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV=y
Please reply with a CC to me if there is any more information you need.
