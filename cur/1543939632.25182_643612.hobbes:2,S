Agreed. But it's not likely to be a priority - all the vendors want
completely modular kernels. But now we see what Linus wants to do,
perhaps we can try to be a bit more friendly toward that. It's not
actually rocket science, after all. I was concerned that he wanted to
use the modules in the initrd, but now I see Linus, and everyone else,
just want to do what I also secretly do, and just not use an initrd.
Isn't it funny. We all secretly hate using initrds ourselves :)
