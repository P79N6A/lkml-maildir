Thanks for the patch.

It hasn't been proven that it's really needed.  95% of the current
drivers create their urbs when the device is plugged in, and then free
them when they are removed.  Making that kind of allocation into a slab
is a bit silly :)
Now if more drivers start doing fun stuff like the visor.c driver does
in the 2.5 tree, then it might make more sense to create a URB specific
slab.
