This is the path I was planning to take when I read about 802_11.h 
possibly going away a while ago.  The file finally going away will just 
raise the priority of that effort a bit :)  Changing the code to use the 
headers in drivers/net/wireless isn't a big task -- I'll put the change 
into the next snapshot of ipw2100.
