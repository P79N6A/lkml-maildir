Um.  But ... let's say I'm on a P4 box running a distro kernel.  I suspect
most distros will set NR_CPUs to 8.  So that's 128 byte cachelines * 8 CPUs
gives 1024 bytes -- 1k.  Per dcounter (never mind the size of seqlock or
dc_base/dc_min):

And then we have 3 of these (an additional 3k..).  Per blockgroup.
My 4GB / has 30 blockgroups; my 30GB /home has 232.  So that's a little
under 8 per GB.  My _laptop_ has a 40GB drive, so that's on the order
of 320 blockgroups -- almost an additional megabyte of ram consumed for
these counters.
Maybe it makes big boxes go faster, but this makes my dual CPU desktop 
go slower, and that's not acceptable.
