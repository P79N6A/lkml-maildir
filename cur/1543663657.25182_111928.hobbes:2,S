I don't see why that's an issue - the pagetables are per-process, not
per-thread.
Yes, that was a stalling point for sticking kmap in there, which was
amongst my original plotting for it, but the stuff that's per-process
still works. 
I'm not suggesting kmapping them dynamically (though it's rather like
permanent kmap), I'm suggesting making enough space so we have them all
there for each process all the time. None of this tiny little window
shifting around stuff ...
