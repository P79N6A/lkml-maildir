What are you running now? PAM login?
Whatever it is, there is no need for you to install the util-linux login
program. Read its documentation, and you will find there are options to
disable the things you don't need. If you set the config correctly,
util-linux will not overwrite your existing shadow utilities.

Because the shadow suite supersedes the util-linux login program. Nobody
should be using the util-linux login anymore. Even if you keep your passwords
in /etc/passwd, the shadow suite's highly configurable login program is
reason enough to install it.
