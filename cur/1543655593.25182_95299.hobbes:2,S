    With my patch, we don't use a zero length :?? My patch sees if
PAGE_ALIGN will f*ck the length, and if so, it returns EINVAL. This
is better than getting '0' as a valid address when specifying a large
size, don't you think so?

    Because PAGE_ALIGN won't return 0? I don't see your assumption of
'len' going to zero due to my patch :?? With my patch, if the
requested size is '0', then the hint address is returned, and if the
size is so high that PAGE_ALIGN will barf at it, returning 0 when it
shouldn't, mmap will return EINVAL. The function never uses a 'len'
of 0. Never.
