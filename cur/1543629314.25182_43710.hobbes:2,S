Hi Antonello,
if you're new to the kernel ( like me :o), you could take Rubini &
Corbets ``Linux Device Drivers'' book, and write a special driver for
your problem. That could be a nice task for learning the kernel.
I did something similar, programming a little parport-LED-lightshow.
Your real and my artificial problem enlightenes one in driver, module,
kernel and user-space / kernel-space relations, and is ( thus ) a fine
task to start with.
Regards
Frank
PS: Many thanks to Alessandro and Jonathan for this fine collection of
paper.
