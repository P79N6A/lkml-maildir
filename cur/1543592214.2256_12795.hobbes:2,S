Aren't all IDE drives built today auto-parking? Auto-parking became an
inherent feature in voice coil drives (stepper-motor drives weren't
auto-parking), and since all drives are voice coil drives, then they
should auto-park. But i've had problems with some hard drives that were
spinned down (when Win____ was shutdown)..  if i reset the PC (instead
of turning it off), the hard drives wouldn't come back on so i'd have to
do a full shutdown of the machine.
