Actually, what it looks like is even simpler.  The extension cable 
contains a four-port hub chip (which is the most common commodity chip) 
and haven't bothered changing the descriptor to tell the computer only 
one port is actually active.  So only one port can be activated, and the 
others are stubbed out in some evil way.  In that case, it should be 
noisy but harmless.
