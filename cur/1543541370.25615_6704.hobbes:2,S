Unfortunately, disabling kupdate for saving power has some problems:
it is all-disks-being synced or no-disks-being-synced. I'd like to
save power on hda, but not on sda which is on external power anyway
(usb zip).
I tried to make my own flushed using fsync("/dev/sda"), but it just
will not work; fsync("/dev/sda1"), fsync("/dev/sda2"), ... would be
needed due to aliasing issues. It gets ugly.
Would it be possible to tell kupdate not to do updates on /dev/hda?
