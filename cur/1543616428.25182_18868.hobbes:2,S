generic_buffer_fdatasync() and hence do_buffer_fdatasync()

Yeah.  The code can't deadlock because:
	page_cache_get();
	spin_lock(&pagecache_lock);
	page_cache_release();
we implicitly *know* that page_cache_release won't try
to acquire pagemap_lru_lock, because the page is in the
pagecache and has count=2 or more.  Which is a bit, umm,
subtle.
I get the feeling that a lot of this would be cleaned up
if presence on an LRU contributed to page->count.  It
seems strange, kludgy and probably racy that this is not
the case.
