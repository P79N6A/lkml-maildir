What surprises me is that this is a regression.  The original hotplug
code on top of Nicksched(TM) removed that lock as part of the "don't
change cpus_allowed to migrate on exec" fix.  When we pushed the patch
straight into Linus' tree, we had to do lock_cpu_hotplug because we
didn't have that code.
Obviously, it escaped somewhere...
Cheers,
Rusty.
