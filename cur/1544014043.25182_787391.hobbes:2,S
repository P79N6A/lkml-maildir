Subject: New ext4 patchset: 2.6.28-ext4-2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is an update of the draft set of patches which I hope to be able to
push to Linus shortly, after a tad bit more testing.
These patches fix a few cosmetic issues, add stable@kernel.org markings
for patches that should be attached to the stable tree, and fix a few
bugs in the "allow-ext4-to-run-without-a-journal" patch as well as fix a
potential deadlock in the blkdev-releasepage patches.
