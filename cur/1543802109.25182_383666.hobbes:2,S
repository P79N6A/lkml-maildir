	While I can see where you are coming from, there are other
projects (not in-tree yet) that use configfs that may not use ocfs2.
Red Hat's cluster stuff plays with it, I think CKRM has as well.  They
need the ability to select it without selecting ocfs2, and they are
definitely not EMBEDDED.
	Is there any other way we can satisfy this?
