This is completely tru in my two test scenarios. Winex 3.1 running
"Baldurs Gate I" is as smooth as -O10 or -A3 and it is impossible to
trigger a permanent starvation. Switching to a text console and back, I
only hear brief, ca 1.5 seconds, "sound repeats" after which the game
recovers totally. Clicking the "Software standard BLT[on/off]", that
even triggered a short priority inversion in A3, has no impact at all.
Playability, for those who wonder, is an impressive 9 out of 10 ;-)
Blender 2.28 can not starve xmms one iota. Within blender itself, I can
cause 1 to 5 second freezes while doing a slow "world rotate", but that
is something the application programmers have to fix.
I see no throughput regression, and overall "feel" of the system is
great. A real keeper, this one.
