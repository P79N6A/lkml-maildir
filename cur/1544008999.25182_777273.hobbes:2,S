Yes it DOES!
If I want to know if a code block triggers event X or Y, and your read
call triggers one of those events, I can't figure out the answer to my
profiling problem.
That is completely fundamental to all of this.  And this is why this
proposal is a non-workable solution.

But that's what monitoring libraries want, they want to stop the task
and inspect it.
Look at the PAPI library.  If you can't implement what that thing
provides, all the real users of profiling information can't use
this stuff.

I really don't think you get the use case for these kinds of
facilities.
Once again I encourage you to look at the test programs, test cases,
and wonderful documentation provided with the PAPI and perfmon2
library bits.  That's how people want to use this stuff.  Ignore
at your own peril :-)
