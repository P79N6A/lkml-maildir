	I've seen some support for the 3Dnow functions of the K6-2.
	What does it mean exactly ? Faster execution ? Better context
	switching ?
	Here is my concern :
	At home, I have one K6-2/333 (UW SCSI) and one PPro 200 (SCSI2).
	Compilation time for one source tree takes 16 minutes with the K6
	and 22 minutes with the PPro (quite good).
	2 compilations + MP3 playing (x11amp) on each machine give :
	65 minutes on the K6 and 50 minutes on the PPro.
	So, under moderate load, my brand new 333 MHz computer is much
	slower than my old PPro. Is there a mean to optimize things ?
