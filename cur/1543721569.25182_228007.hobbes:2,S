The first "official" version of Linux that included USB serial code
that mentioned you (Adam Richter and/or Yggdrasil) was 2.4.  That same
version included the same binary firmware you complained about in
2001, and the changelog in usbserial.c makes it clear that *at least*
the WhiteHEAT firmware was already present when you contributed your
code.
Would you explain why your claim of copyright infringement is not
estopped by the pre-existing condition of firmware being present?
