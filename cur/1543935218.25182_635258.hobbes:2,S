It's already in the driver core to the most part.  It remains to be seen
what is less complicated in the end:  Transparent mutex-protected list
accesses provided by driver core (requires the iterator), or all the
necessary locking done by the drivers themselves (requires some more
lock-taking but perhaps fewer lock instances overall in the drivers, and
respective redefinitions and documentation of the driver core API).
Semi off-topic:  What about struct device.sem?  Is there any chance to
rip this out of the driver core and let drivers serialize everything?  I
suppose not...
