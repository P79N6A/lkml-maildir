Yes, register_chrdev() will do nothing for udev.
Take a look at the book, Linux Device Drivers, third edition (free
online).  In the chapter about the driver model, there is a section
about what udev needs.  The functions it says to use are no longer in
the kernel, but it should point you in the right direction (hint, use
class_device_create().)
If you have a pointer to your code, I can probably knock out a patch for
you very quickly.
thanks,
