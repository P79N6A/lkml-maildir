Linux Kernel 2.4.18-14 [Redhat 8 standard installation] 
As I underlined, I have been able to disable IP header checksumming for the
received packets, so the system will not drop the packets even after CRC
becomes invalid when the source address changes.
I have been asking this question over ten different mailing list and forums
and no one has come up with a "solid" solution. I would be exteremely glad
if I get a working source code.
I know the application will be so very simple, just changing some bits with
another and putting it back to userspace, but it requires some low-level
libraries and the knowledge to use them...

The main reason I suggested correcting the checksum is if it was done that
way, the kernel would 
behave normally for all other IP traffic and simply do a dodgy on only
traffic from 192.168.1.1
If nobody else jumps in, let me think about it for a day or so and I'll see
what I can do. It's been 
a couple of years since I last looked at the network code though.
What kernel are you running?
Regards,
Brad
