Hi,
what is the current status of this and what are the plans for the
future? Apparently there is a lot of hurt feelings on the side of the
creator of the famous cdrecord program...
J"org Schilling's notes on the topic are here
http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/linuxscsi.html
and a discussion of the three "competing" interfaces is here
http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/sg.text
Is this likely to get sorted out any time soon?
Jan
