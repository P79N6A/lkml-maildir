and please note that this change itself is a bit dangerous. Suppose that
a bad user does sys_prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, LONG_MIN | SIGCHLD), and now
valid_signal(arg2) (or valid_signal((int)arg2)) returns T.
(nothing really bad happens because ->pdeath_signal is "int", but still).
Note also that it is correct to do prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, 0), so the
patch was doubly wrong here.
So, please check very carefully every change you are going to do. Make
sure you don't change the behaviour, unless you think the current code
is buggy. In that case please document the fix.
OTOH, I don't understand why sys_mq_notify() accepts sigev_signo == 0,
perhaps this is oversight. good_sigevent() looks correct, but should
use the helper.

I'd say explicit casts should be avoided as much as possible.
As for this particular case. Note that valid_signa((int)long_arg)
only helps to hide the problem.
Oleg.
