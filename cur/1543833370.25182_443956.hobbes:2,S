Not hardly.  If you did remember the exact details, you'd remember
that it was in 2000, and someone "discovered" that tt mode didn't
allow kernel memory to be protected from userspace.  It had always
been well documented that tt mode had this problem and you shouldn't
be using it if you needed a secure VM.

Now, there were a couple of ways to legitimately escape from UML, and
they *did* involve ptrace.  Things like single-stepping a system call
instruction or putting a breakpoint on a system call instruction and
single-stepping from the breakpoint.  As far as I know, these were
discovered and fixed by UML developers before there was any outside
awareness of these bugs.
