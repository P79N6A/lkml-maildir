 Dear Colleagues
 It is my first time in your list.
 I hope someone can help me about the following questions:
 1- I would like to add one more field in the end of process table
 (e.g. struct task_struct). Could this modification produce some
 kind of problem ?? Which is the effect of this modification in
 INIT_TASK ??
 2- The value of the field counter is a very important parameter in
 the linux scheduling. I know that counter is modified by three
 function: update_process_times, schedule and add_to_runqueue. Do
 you know other functions ??
 3- My kernel version is 2.0.34.
 Thank you for your attention.
 Best regards,
 Livia Catarina
