The remaining problem is that we don't really have a standard location
for 'vmlinux'.
For most cases, you can find the required file in
	 /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/vmlinux
but that's only available when you've built the kernel on that machine
and have the build tree lying around.
This is what oprofile currently does:
oprofile-0.9.1/gui/oprof_start_config.cpp:      /* Guess path to vmlinux based on kernel currently running. */
oprofile-0.9.1/gui/oprof_start_config.cpp:              string const vmlinux_path("/lib/modules/" + version
oprofile-0.9.1/gui/oprof_start_config.cpp:                                       + "/build/vmlinux");
oprofile-0.9.1/gui/oprof_start_config.cpp:              kernel_filename = vmlinux_path;
It would be nice if it's possible to obtain the location information
somewhere, in a distribution-agnostic manner.
regards,
