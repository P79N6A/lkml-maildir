Well, I think the best answer for a distribution kernel without making a 
any patches or rebuilding anything is to use the "register_rtc()" hook 
in the rtc driver.   I tried it and it works really well.  This way my 
device driver can drop into a Fedora system without the user having to 
rebuild anything  (other than my driver).
 If I want to get fancy I could check to see if IRQ 8 is taken and use 
it directly if it's not, i.e. the RTC driver isn't loaded. If IRQ 8 is 
taken, check for the RTC driver and then use that via register_rtc().  
In the unlikely event that IRQ 8 is taken and it's not by the RTC 
driver, then I guess the user's out of luck.
Thanks for all the suggestions, they've all been good, but I'm trying 
avoid steep requirements on usage of this driver. 
Rick Niles.
