HI
After doing several ioctls to an experimental code, my system becomes 
very unstable (emacs gcc more ... reply Fatal error) 
Actually here is what I do
USER side
Buffer is an 80 int array 
void test_proc(int fd,int * Buffer)
{
 ioctl(fd,NASTY_IOCTL,Buffer)
}
Buffer is at 0x0804d880
sizeof Buffer is 320
the IOCTL def
#define NASTY_IOCTL  _IOWR(_MY_IOC_MAGIC,1, int BUFER_SIZE)
KERNEL side
ioctl_proc(....)
..
case NASTY_IOCTL:
  Image_Buffer=(int*)kmalloc(80*sizeof(int),GFP_KERNEL)
  error_code=verify_area(VERIFY_READ,(void*)arg,80*sizeof(int))
  if (error_code)
      return -EPERM
  memcpy_from_fs(Image_Buffer,void* arg,80*sizeof(int))
  kfree(Image_Buffer)
  break;
...
In general the problems occurs after 20 or more IOCTL calls
There are no oops, no visible problems but in fact it s impossible to 
lauch emacs or gcc..and rapidly things go weird
so I reboot the machine again and again ...and sometimes I see explicit 
crashes 
This message is also repeated very often
free_one_pmd: bad directory entry   0xxxxxx with several adresses and 
among theses adresses I see 0x0804d880 wich is the beginning of the 
buffer
If I remove the memcpy_fromfs all is OK...
So please help..
Perhaps the user programs release the buffer to quickly (before the 
memcpy_fromfs has finished it's copy ?? ...)
