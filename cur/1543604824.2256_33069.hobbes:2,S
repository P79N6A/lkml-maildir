Ok, here's the patch against 2.4.10-ac10. This seems to produce
acceptable behaviour in the cases I tested, at least. Someone with one
of those "ridiculously small MTU" links might give it a go to check that
the rcv_mss estimation still works as expected. It should, though, as I
didn't really make any changes to it.

A too low rcv_mss estimate isn't a problem, as the estimate is
immediately increased when the first larger segment arrives. A too high
estimate can be difficult to adjust down, though, if the sender suddenly
starts sending smalls segments with PSH set.

Hopefully a bit more conservative now. I didn't implement the fall back
to ack-every-two-packets, though, as I had the exact opposite problem.
:)
