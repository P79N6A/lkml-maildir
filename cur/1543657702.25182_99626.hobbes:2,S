I'd really like to see the organizational patches first (ie the 
net/Kconfig type of changes), and leave the "conditional menu" patches for 
later, especially as they would seem to be improved by an extension to the 
config language (ie the "menucond" thing).
Also, I don't fetch patches, I'd much rather just be mailbombed.
