Thanks.
It should only be a matter of reversing the patches for Solaris then.
But that will of course bring back the warnings on that platform. I'd
say we should stick with what the standard says. Unfortunatly I don't
have access to the standard so I wouldn't know which is the correct
version. If I'd have to guess I'd say the odds are in favor of glibc
getting it more right than solaris.
Should I extract the changes for bkbits and make a reversed patch?
