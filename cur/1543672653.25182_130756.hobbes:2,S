Glad to hear that.

I've written a few of the stack reduction patches.  Lots of ioctl functions
need work, so gcc handling it better would be good to have.
I have mostly used kmalloc/kfree, but using automatic variables is certainly
cleaner to write (code).  One of the patches that I did just made each ioctl
cmd call a separate function, and then each separate function was able to use
automatic variables on the stack instead of kmalloc/kfree.  I prefer this
method when it's feasible (and until gcc can handle these cases).
