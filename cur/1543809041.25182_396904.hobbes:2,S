No, that's _exactly_ what the spec says (well, not verbatim but close  
enough).  When you disconnect, both the master and slave devices are  
perfectly free to assume that the connection is completely broken and  
no state is maintained.  Anything that breaks that assumption is  
against the spec and likely to break in odd scenarios.

Which causes worse data-loss, writing out cached pages and filesystem  
metadata to a filesystem that has changed in the mean-time (possibly  
allocating those for metadata, etc) or forcibly unmounting it as  
though the user pulled the cable?  Most filesystems are designed to  
handle the latter (it's the same as a hard-shutdown), whereas _none_  
are designed to handle the former.
A good set of suspend scripts should handle the hardware-suspend with  
no extra work because hardware supporting hardware-suspend basically  
inevitably supports USB low-power-mode, and handle software-suspend  
by either forcibly syncing and unmounting USB filesystems or by  
failing the suspend and asking the user to.  You also could patch the  
kernel to fail a powerdown software suspend if some USB device is  
mounted or otherwise unremovably in-use.

Except that would make Linux broken with respect to the USB spec.  It  
is fallacious to assume that a USB device that the kernel has told to  
disconnect will still have the same state when the kernel tries to  
reconnect, even _if_ you could reliably identify it (which you can't  
because there is no serial number of any sort on a lot of devices.
