It's possible, but there are some minor complications, e.g. linux/coda.h has
its own magic code that would likely break in the process, so it needs
to be skipped. Some other files conditionally include <sys/types.h> or
<stdint.h> in user space and would break in a similar way.
For the __kernel_ types, we have 87 instances in the tree, and 53 more that
would have to change. For the int types, there are over 4000 instances
of the correct __u32 style and about 800 that use the u_int32_t or
uint32_t style, most of them in netfilter and linux/pfkeyv2.h.
I'd probably leave at least the drm, netfilter and mtd headers alone,
as they are known to be working and consistently use the stdint.h types.
