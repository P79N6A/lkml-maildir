I can't speak for safemode, but doing something like:
[22:43:47]rml@phantasy:~$ mpg321 /home/mp3/Get_Up_Kids-Woodson.mp3 &
[22:52:03]rml@phantasy:~$ dbench 16
I don't get any blips (nothing over 0.5s, anyhow, I would wager).
This is a P3-733, i815 board, 384MB PC133, AHA-2940U2W, U2W IBM 9GB system.
Linux 2.4.9-ac14 + preempt + and more
