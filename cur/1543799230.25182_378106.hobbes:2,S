very interesting; a few quick questions that I didn't see answered on
the side
1) where can we download the patches?
2) How does the use of "absolute paths" interact with namespaces?
   In principle each process can have its own namespace after all!
   (not many distributions use this today, but that will change soon,
   per user /tmp is a very attractive feature and all needed
   infrastructure helpers for this will be in the 2.6.15 kernel)
