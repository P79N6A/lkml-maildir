How about adding a header to messages posted by non-subscribers
 X-vger-kernel-org: non-subscriber
and maybe even a different footer:
--
 This mail was from a non-subscriber and may not have reached all
 subscribers. 
Then people who think the list should be subscriber-only could enforce
that locally, and people who want to be more broad-minded still have
that option.
Then something like:
 IF it is from a subscriber
  OR it has a subject mentioning my area of interest 
 THEN let it through
 ELSE apply strict spam checks.
I'd really like to add 
  OR in reply to some lkml message, but as as Message-id: is left
  untouch when the mail is forwarded (probably a good thing) that
  doesn't seem to be possible.
