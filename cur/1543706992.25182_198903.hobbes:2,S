Thanks Hans.  I am not an SQL fan either.  But more than SQL this
is about database like storage simantics in the filesystem. I had
this idea in my mind for some time, but the real motivation came
after seeing the Reiserfs 4 page, notably this section:
http://www.namesys.com/v4/v4.html#design_flaws_details
and hopefully the plugin design will make life much easier.
By looking at the feedback I got off the list, I think there is a
couple of points I need to clarify.
o The plan is _not_ to implement a fully flegded database inside
  the kernel.  Only the storage (well, "only" may not be the most
  appropriate word here, because this involves a _lot_ of work)
  and the relation operation primitives - or database operation
  primitives to be more general - are implemented in the kernel
  space.
o Userspace tools are necessary to parse a query, optimize if
  necessary, and pass the result (which is a tree) to the kernel.
  And the nodes of the parsed tree will map to the primitives
  implemented in the kernel.
  And most likely, I would be using an exiting database to do the
  heavy userspace work (suggested by Peter Zaitsev of MySQL).
Thanks for all the suggessions and comments (mostly offline).
