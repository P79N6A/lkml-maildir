Life gets even more interesting when you hit another exception
inside destructor(s) being executed due to first one.
Say, spin_unlock() discovers that lock is already unlocked
and does "throw BUG_double_unlock".
Even if you
(a) remember what standard says about it
(b) implemented nested exception handling correctly,
	then you are still left with
(c) let's pray gcc has no bugs in stack unwinding
    and nested exceptions and nested destructor calls.
Mozilla crashes over such things. For Mozilla, crash is not
*that* catastrophic. For OS kernel, it is.
