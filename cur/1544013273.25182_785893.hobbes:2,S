On 64 bit AMD machine I was getting :
[    0.000000] KERNEL supported cpus:
[    0.000000]   Intel GenuineIntel
[    0.000000]   AMD AuthenticAMD
[    0.000000]   Centaur CentaurHauls
By using the following patch I get rid of extra CPU support and also
reduces size of the kernel.
Let me know why should I choose EMBEDDED option ? I know I am not
using Embbeded machine and I do not need embbeded features on my
machine. If I am willing to go North why should I go South first ?

          This lets you choose what x86 vendor support code your kernel
          will include.
