It has some problems.
First, note that the list manipulations in dpm_suspend(), 
device_power_down(), and so on aren't protected by dpm_list_mtx.  So 
your patch could corrupt the list pointers.  Are you assuming that no 
other threads can be running at this time?
Note also that device_pm_destroy_suspended() does up(&dev->sem), but it 
doesn't know whether or not dev->sem was locked to begin with.
Do you want to rule out the possibility of a driver's suspend or remove 
methods calling destroy_suspended_device() on its own device?  With 
your synchronous approach, this would mean that the suspend/resume 
method would indirectly end up calling the remove method.  This is 
dangerous at best; with USB it would be a lockdep violation.  With an 
asynchronous approach, on the other hand, this wouldn't be a problem.
