No, a kobject by itself knows nothing about a module.  Only the
attribute files do (and they are the things that contain the struct
module *), as they are what user space can grab references to.
I never thought that the kobject would care, as it is only a directory,
and I didn't think that anything could grab directory references on
their own.  But then Maneesh's patch wasn't in the kernel at that time
:)
