I suspect that it _is_ an issue we can resolve entirely within audit
code. See the patch I posted half an hour or so ago to the linux-audit
list. If we agree on that approach, I'll do the equivalent for the git
tree either later this evening or tomorrow.
I've reverted your recent change to put audit messages directly into
skbs "in order to eliminate the extra copy", on the basis that it
blatantly wasn't having that effect anyway. Now we copy from the
audit_buffer into an optimally-sized skb which netlink_trim() won't have
to mangle. I've also removed the skb_get() immediately before
netlink_send() which always made me unhappy.
