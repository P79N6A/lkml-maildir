Subject: Enhancement patch for the Adaptec SCSI Driver (2915LP / 2930LP)

Hi everyone,
I'll make this really quick.
Attached to this email is a small patch for the current aic7xxx driver for 
Linux. It can be applied to 2.4.x, 2.5.x and 2.6.x and the original adaptec 
driver version 2.0.2 .
This patch adds one PCI device id mapping for the Adaptc 2915LP controller ( a 
low profile controller). I believe that the 2930LP is the same controller as 
the 2915LP, so the patch ought to work for that one as well. Furthermore 
there seems to be an Fujitsu AVA-2915LP controller which is most likely the 
same as above.
The patch is verified to work on a 2.4.20 kernel. A simple tape drive was 
attached to it and that worked as well :-)
I have submitted the patch to Adaptec with the request for integration but no 
one knows if and when that will happen. Perhaps someone on this list is or 
feels responible for that driver and can make the inclusion happen.
Thanks in advance,
- Holger
