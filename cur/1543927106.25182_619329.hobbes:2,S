Woah, the linux-usb-devel@sf.net list is NOT a subscriber-only list at
all.  It's wide open with a bunch of mailman rule filter to try to
handle the worst of the spam.
It does complain if you try to add too many cc:s to it, but that's it,
an admin (me or Stephen) will usually get around to aproving them within
24 hours.
But, I have no objection to moving to vger if you want to handle the
admin load.  If so, should I send you a list of addresses that were on
the sf.net list so that people can be migrated?
thanks,
