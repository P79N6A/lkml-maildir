On the other hand when __cplusplus is defined they define it to the  
"__null" builtin, which GCC uses to give type conversion errors for  
"int foo = NULL" but not "char *foo = NULL".  A "((void *)0)"  
definition gives C++ type errors for both due to the broken C++ void  
pointer conversion problems.
