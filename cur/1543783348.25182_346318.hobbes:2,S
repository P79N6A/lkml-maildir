Dominik,
So what is the chipset inside the enclosure?  Looking at your output,
the 'Argosy' stuff doesn't tell me anything.  You might have to open
up the case to look in there to find more details.  
Again, check with your vendor and see if there is newer firmware.  And
have you powered up the device without having it plugged into the
system, then plug it in?  What happens then?
John
