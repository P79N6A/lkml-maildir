Actually, I was thinking just the opposite.  Based on Linus' comments
(see 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.1/1861.html
 and
maybe 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.2/0089.html
too) we can always try and get the 8250 serial backend in once kgdb +
enet driver is already in.
