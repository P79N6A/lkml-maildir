Sounds very good.  I recommend that it be written in DocBook and added
to the Documentation/DocBook directory of the kernel tree.

Great, the janitor project can really use extra people to help out.  I
suggest that you read over their TODO list again and pick up the pieces
from there that are missing from your "Driver Hardening HOWTO".

Agreed.

Thanks for listening.

Sounds good.  I know those people are actively working to get their code
into the 2.5 kernel, using the driver model.  This is a good thing.

Agreed, it should be done in userspace.

It would be wonderful if there were some good FI tools that were
available for our use.  It can only help to make better drivers.
Thank you for your response, and for listening to the community.
