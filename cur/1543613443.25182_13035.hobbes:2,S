I'm confused.  How was the patch generated ?   How should I apply it ?
The patch repeats some of Krzystofs changes so I can't apply it over the
top of his patch but at the same time it doesn't include the changes for
FarSite, SBE Inc or you own Cyclades cards.  Better to have a patch that
brings all the drivers up to spec in one hit surely.
Probably too late to get API changes into 2.4.x, but we should get the
generic HDLC layer into 2.5.x ASAP IMHO.  Then you might be able to argue
for a backport into 2.4.x in the future.

Tell me about it :-)  FarSite are having to maintain an extra set of patches
for customers who need the functionality of the generic layer.
ps. I'm no longer working for FarSite the lure of embeded Linux and video
    was too much :-) so these comments are mine not theirs.
