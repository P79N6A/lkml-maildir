Irix 6.5 uses a scheme we call "augmented Superuser", in which
capabilities are checked first, with the uid 0 check done
iff the cap test failed. Trusted Irix (the B1 version of Irix)
uses pure capabilities. Root is allowed all capabilities in either
case. The assertion is proven by example.

Unless you want to embark on a strictly role based administrative
model. I advocate against role based admin models. Unless a system
is designed with one in mind (hint: UNIX wasn't) role based models
are very tough to make work right.
