Before you change your mind again, I agree with the above.
I'm convinced MSI support will only get better and not worse.
The reason is all high speed interconnects (IB, 10gige) and many
storage controllers already support MSI becuase it's more efficient
and will benchmark better at the very least. Server vendors won't be
able to sell their boxes if MSI isn't working.
Desktop has never been as sensitive to IO performance and I don't
know what the situation currently is with laptop gige NICs and
gfx cards (gfx cards use MSI? I don't see it in drivers/video).
