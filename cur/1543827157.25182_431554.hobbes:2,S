If is very much a matter of taste, why are you trying to dictate to
the ext2 developers how they choose to do things?  As long as it
works, and we haven't screwed up yet, I'd argue this is falls into the
category of letting each subsystem decide how they best work.  The way
DaveM and the networking team works is quite different from how the
SCSI developers work or the XFS team work --- it's not a
one-size-fits-all sort of thing.
And I'd also dispute with your "weren't really suited for the original
ext2-style design" comment.  Ext2/3 was always designed to be
extensible from the start, and we've successfully added features quite
successfully for quite a while.

I don't think it will be another decade, but yes, regardless of
whether we do a code fork or not, it will take time.  Basically, you
and the ext2 developers have a disagreement about whether or not a
code fork will actually move the process along more quickly or not.
Either way, we will be releasing early and often, so people can test
it out and comment on it.  Releasing patches to LKML is just the first
step in this process.
