Indeed. Let me make one final point then. If you think this issue is 
important, you might start by asking the administrators of linux-kernel 
and associated lists to toss majordomo away, because sending e-mail to 
majordomo@vger.kernel.org (which is a published address, which will 
respond via e-mail to every message it receives) is the only way to 
subscribe to linux-kernel. (ie: There is no web form)
You'll want to find all majordomo users and tell them to stop using the 
program. Also users of ezmlm will be affected as well. And that's just the 
start.
In reality, there are probably hundreds of mailing list packages that 
rightfully assume that there is nothing wrong with responding to inquiries 
they receive via e-mail. And a significant number of these probably offer 
no native web GUI, making them useless and evil in your new world.
I'd be willing to venture a guess that the majority of Internet mailing 
lists have some form of an autoresponder associated with them. The SpamCop 
folks don't seem to address this issue, nor does anyone else I've heard 
this "no auto-responders" argument from, and nor have you.
You don't have to defend SpamCop's short-sighted attitude. It would 
probably be better to drop such a silly idea as the termination of all 
auto-responders, because it will never, ever happen. There are too many 
legitimate uses of this technology to eliminate it. But as you say, 
we disagree, that is life...
