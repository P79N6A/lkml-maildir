Well, it's not so much of a matter of the user not being able to
handle it, but the current tools not supporting. UNIX has no tools to
handle this sort of thing. You'd need to rewrite tar. And gzip. And
bzip2. And cpio. And pax. And ar. And zip. And lha. And so forth. I
think you get the idea. That's a lot of code. All for something which
can arguable be solved with directories.

Well, Xt and Xlib are mainly intended as low level toolkits. Write in
Qt, or GTK+, or Gnome, or [insert a good toolkit here]. You
essentially nix your argument with this.

I don't understand this argument. So far as I can tell it's content-free.

Then don't do it. Do data signature matching, which is fairly
reliable. (UNIX file command. I've gotten pretty low false-pos rates
with it. And it can be improved upon). Sure a fork makes it easier, but it's not necessarily the One True Path.

I don't see an advantage either way. Macintoshes of that era were
extremely limiting to someone who really knew the DOS prompt. At the
same time DOS was overly cryptic, poorly designed, and ugly. But it
had a lot of versatility. 
bh> Die conservative Unix attitude, DIE DIE DIE !!!!!!
If you don't like the "Let's look before we jump" attitude, then don't
use UNIX. The reason UNIX works as well as it does is that people have
paid a LOT of attention to detail and tried to make the best
decisions. Simply saying "The Mac does it so it must be good" is
wrong. If it were right, we'd be doing co-operative multi-tasking, in
an non-protected VM space. I don't see the advantage there.
While I don't necessarily agree with Ted at all times, he knows his
shit. Yes, he's a bit more conservative than some, but it helps to
have people who insist on having a good reason for doing things. If at
the end of it you disagree with him and implement it anyway, at least
you were forced to analyze your proposal.
