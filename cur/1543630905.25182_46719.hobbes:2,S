Hello all,
some time ago I wrote about problems with the via-timer and kernel 2.4.x.
Meanwhile I tested kernel linux-2.4.19-pre7ac2 and newly pre8ac4. I couldn't 
detect any problems with the timer (sudden time jumps). Does anybody know 
the reason why? I couldn't find any patch related to this problem in the 
Changelogs.
The problem occures in pre7 - I didn't test pre8.
Regards,
Andreas Hartmann
