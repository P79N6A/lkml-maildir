In what sense?
The current model has no definition for a 'system namespace'.
Accessing /proc/<pid>/mounts where <pid> is running in a different
namespace appears to work.  As well, you can always fchdir back into
another namespace temporarily.  As long as you don't reference any
file/directories using absolute paths (including following symlinks),
then you can already navigate the entire namespace.
This falls apart though when there are no longer any processes keeping
that namespace alive.  When this happens, the vfsmount's are unstitched
and you end up 'stuck' on a given mount :(.
Another caveat is that the current system disallows you from doing any
mount/umount's in another namespace (bogus security?).
