FWIW:
[root@coyote src]# python list-kernel-hardware.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "list-kernel-hardware.py", line 70, in ?
    ret = pciids_to_names(data)
  File "list-kernel-hardware.py", line 11, in pciids_to_names
    pciids = open('/usr/share/misc/pci.ids', 'r')
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/share/misc/pci.ids'
That file apparently doesn't exist on an FC6 i686 system
