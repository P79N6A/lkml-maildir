no. standard netfilter modules. I just happened to notice that everyone
who had the problem  seemed to be using
iptables.
just to recap what the problem is:
kernel 2.4.2[10] maybe even .19, etc SMP deadlock. systems still
responds to ping, iptables logs still scroll along on the console.
but nothing else.
please see my post with ksymoops output of sysrq+T :
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105821579624140&w=2
however, the deadlock happened when the system was under heavy disk IO.
all filesytems are raid1, ext3.
here are my modules:
