I believe that the e1000 wont free up any outgoing packets since the
netpoll call doesn't seem to get to the e1000_clean_tx part of the
e1000_intr, otherwise the system wouldn't lock under the
netpoll_send_skb when one disconnects the wire and puts it back in.  The
disconnect would lock it up anyway (with Andi's patch it now doesn't)
but since it won't come back up after the link is back up, there seems
to be something wrong with the e1000 netpoll driver.  This is because
the e1000_netpoll doesn't seem to be cleaning up the tx buffer and start
the queue back up.

OK, the system is under heavy memory load and starts eating up the
netpoll packets.  When the last packet is gone, and you have something
like the e1000 that doesn't clean up its packets with netpoll, then you
just locked up the system.
The scary part of this loop is that if the netpoll doesn't come up with
the goods, its game over.  Say we are at desperate measures but it could
be a case where we need to output more information and lockup here
before we can go out and free some memory.

So even a long timeout would not do?  So you don't even get a message to
the console?

Then maybe what Andi told me is not true ;-)
Oh, and did your machine crash when you saw it?  Have you seen it with
the e1000 driver?

(ouch!)
OK, since my argument is currently only theory, and I don't have a e1000
card to test this on, I'll take out my fix to the e100 (where it cleaned
up it's tx drivers in netpoll) and see if I can get the machine to
lockup here just by putting it under extreme memory loads.
