Great, thanks.  (There's also such a test in fs/nfs/direct.c,
but let's not trouble Trond until we've settled what to do here.)

I was about to Ack that, now that I've found something or other in the
libhugetlb testsuite comes this way, even on page[1], without showing
any problem.
However, I have noticed a particular inefficiency arising: that
bio_check_pages_dirty test specifically avoids pages already
PageDirty; but hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty carefully redirects to
set the head page dirty: so tail pages of a hugetlb compound page
will tend never to be PageDirty, and keep on coming back this way.
Which led me to look up the origin of those PageCompound tests:

    [PATCH] Speed up direct-io hugetlbpage handling
    This patch short-circuits all the direct-io page dirtying logic for
    higher-order pages.  Without this, we pointlessly bounce BIOs up to keventd
    all the time.

It looks like I was wrong in thinking it was just trying to avoid 
the crash on page[1].mapping.  At the least, your patch needs also
to remove that paragraph of comment from Andrew.  But really, it
looks like those PageCompound tests should stay, unless you can
persuade Andrew to Ack their removal.
Except (now, how many times can I change my mind in the course of
one email?), hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty was specifically added by
Ken Chen to avoid losing data via /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.  Yet
fs/bio.c is carefully avoiding going there when dirtying a hugepage.
How does this work?  Looks like those PageCompound tests need to go!
I'm lost: I hope Andrew and Ken can sort it out for us.
