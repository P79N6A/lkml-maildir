I suspect that trying -rc3-mm1 but refreshing just the 10 patches above
from -mmotm would be far less likely to pull in other heartburn?

That's a 41,240 line diff, the rest *total* to about 400 lines.  I don't have
warm-n-fuzzies about my odds here. ;)
I'm a git-idiot, but *do* know how to git-bisect through Linus tree - what
would I need to do to git-bisect through git-x86.patch? (I do *not* know how
to deal with more than 1 source git tree, so if the magic is just 'get a
linus tree, merge git-x86, then bisect as usual", I'm stuck on "merge git-x86")..
