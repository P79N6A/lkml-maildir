hi everyone,
        im a kernel newbie. im using a debian linux(ie ubuntu).i did
cross compilation for ia64 on my system which is ia32. Now im trying
to cross compile ia64 kernel but im getting some error. before
compiling kernel, i did made changes in Makefile to specify my
ia64-linux compiler and libraries .
when i gave make menuconfig command i got following errors
root@atoka-desktop:/linux-2.6.18# make ARCH=ia64 menuconfig
  HOSTCC  scripts/basic/fixdep
scripts/basic/fixdep.c: In function 'use_config':
scripts/basic/fixdep.c:204: error: 'PATH_MAX' undeclared (first use in
this function)
scripts/basic/fixdep.c:204: error: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
scripts/basic/fixdep.c:204: error: for each function it appears in.)
scripts/basic/fixdep.c:204: warning: unused variable 's'
scripts/basic/fixdep.c: In function 'parse_dep_file':
scripts/basic/fixdep.c:300: error: 'PATH_MAX' undeclared (first use in
this function)
scripts/basic/fixdep.c:300: warning: unused variable 's'
make[1]: *** [scripts/basic/fixdep] Error 1
make: *** [scripts_basic] Error 2
i tried defining the PATH_MAX macro in fixdep.c to 100, but then it
gave error in some other file.
Can anyone help me out with this error?
