 I can do that and I have considered it while preparing the change.  What
convinced me not to use a name that is already present elsewhere in the
tree is the confusion that it sometimes causes.  For example during a
debugging session GDB only reports the file name and not the leading
pathname (and some people do run GDB over the kernel).  Of course the
actual file can still be chased with some `find' and `grep' scriptery, but
why to create a problem in the first place?
 I consider repeated file names throughout a tree of a single program a 
namespace pollution similar to one with repeated static symbol names.  
While syntactically valid and working, it asks for unnecessary confusion.
 This is my point of view, but I can see others may not necessarily follow
it.  I am fine with changing the name to i2c.c as it is unlikely I will
run GDB over it. ;-)
