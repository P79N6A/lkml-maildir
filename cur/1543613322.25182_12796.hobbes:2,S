This module makes it easier to write a filesystem in Python, using the
kernel<->venus interface of the coda filesystem module to handle VFS calls
in userland.
Currently only tested on Linux. Port to *BSD should be near trivial,
Solaris is doable, Windows is theoretically possible.
Flames, patches, comments to me. Flames about "writing a filesystem in 
python is stupid" to /dev/null, I'm not proposing writing ext4 in it... :)
