Yeah that's my problem.
It's not theoretical. We had cases where someone had to go 
through 10+ DIMMs on a big machine in try and error to find
out which one is wrong. Very bad situation.
[Double plus bad if it wasn't actually any of the DIMMs that were
bad, but one of the VRMs on a big Opteron - it causes all the same
symptoms as a bad DIMM :/]

I proposed something like that - best with an ASCII string
("First DIMM on the top left corner") But getting such stuff into BIOS 
is difficult and long winded.
