Hmm.. That may well have worked fine, but it sounds in that post like you
tried to undo the ALSA stuff, and what I suggested was really to do the
reverse: take _only_ the ALSA changes, and then if it still fails, at
least you have now pinpointed it a bit more (admittedly to the _likely_
source, but that's as it should be: you narrow down the "known bad" source
base until you've narrowed it down to the smallest change you can find
that causes the problem).

Sounds like you're doing everything right, but hey, it can't hurt to 
double-check.
