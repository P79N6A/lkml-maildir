It would be a major loss to nvidia *AND* its customers if it were bankrupted in
a lawsuit because it open-sourced code or specs that contained intellectual
property that belonged to somebody else.  Of course, if that happened, you'd
still have the "freedom" to buy the other vendor's cards - maybe(*)
In the real world, ideology needs to be tempered with realism.
(*) there's a ripple effect here - if the otherwise-best laptop is only
available with an nvidia card, you now have the "freedom" to choose a otherwise
less-suitable model.  And so on....
