There are two problems to consider:
    (1) sysfs retains pointers to kobjects long after they have been
	unregistered because of the negative dentrys.
    (2) khubd blocks when removing configurations.
Maneesh's change caused (1) because it grabbed a reference to protect an
existing pointer.  The way to repair the damage is to delete the pointer
ASAP so the reference can be dropped.  That will require changing several
other sysfs routines that assume the pointer is valid.
Such a change is needed because otherwise module unloading can be delayed 
indefinitely, until the system decides it needs to reuse the negative 
dentry.
(2) has been repaired temporarily.  We're still discussing the right way
to fix it permanently, though.  The underlying cause for the reason that
khubd blocked is an odd feature of sysfs: it's willing to delete
directories that contain subdirectories, while leaving the subdirectories
in existence.  (The connection to khubd is slightly obscure but it can be
traced.)
Greg has proposed using an awkward scheme for repeatedly parsing and
creating dynamic data structures from USB configuration descriptors to fix
(2).  I'm in favor of changing the behavior of sysfs, so that either it
refuses to delete directories that contain subdirectories or else it
recursively deletes the subdirectories first.  At this point nothing has
been settled.
