The 710 predates all the useful stuff - it doesnt have INTFLY for example. 
There is a theoretically generic 710 driver in the 2.2 tree used by some
non x86 boxes (Motorola MVME) but nobody has ever attempted to get it working,
and compaq don't document all the details you might like to know (eg the gpio
they use to fake intfly if any)
