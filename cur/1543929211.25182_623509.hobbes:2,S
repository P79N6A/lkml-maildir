Good question. I haven't been able to find something in the
documentation for execve(2) and signal(2) saying it shouldn't be
possible, and it works on Solaris 10, so I'd say it is a Linux bug.
Actually, having another look at the documentation, signal(7) mentions
that POSIX.1-2003 requires that execve is safe to call from inside a
signal handler.
