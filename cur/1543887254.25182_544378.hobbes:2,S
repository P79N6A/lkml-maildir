Ugh.  Well that was a rather sloppy patch on my part.  I'll fix up and resubmit.

Yes, I'll include it in the commit comment.  It is for a board that
isn't in mainline (yet) so a seperate patch doesn't make much sense.

Oops, eaten by stgit (or rather; eaten by my inexperience with stgit.

Done.
BTW, I've just left the driver in drivers/i2c/chips.  It seems
sufficiently different from an rtc (and the interface is totally
difference) that putting it in drivers/rtc seems wrong.  If you
disagree, I can change this.

ok, fixed.  I like to err on the side of caution when it comes to
copyright notices.

You're right.  Removed.

I think it should be okay.  It is used abundantly in the
arch/ppc/syslib/*_devices.c code, and that code is compiled with a lot
of different compiler versions.

Me being paranoid a guess.  Removed.

Gah!
