Booting 2.5.31 (non-bk) on hde5, a UDMA(66) Quantum Fireball
on a PDC20267 add-on card, resulted in a complete hang as init
came to its "mount -n -o remount,rw /" point. No visible messages
or anything in the log.
2.5.29 worked ok on this box, as does 2.4 and 2.2+Andre's IDE code.
ASUS P3B-F, 440BX UDMA(33) chipset, disks on a Promise Ultra100 card.
