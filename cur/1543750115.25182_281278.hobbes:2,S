That might be easier, since BK operations take a large amount of time on
my laptop.  I'll send you the emails under separate cover.

I did do a bk lease renew at the top (in the log).  My clock is
controlled by NTP, but it just syncs to the localhost fudge when it
loses all net connection.  The time doesn't jump when this happens (it
does drift by a few hundred milliseconds every hour or so I remain
disconnected, though).
Where it happens seems to be variable.  Most often it's the first or
second commit.
