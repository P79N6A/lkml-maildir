I think what happened was that [patch 3/4] fixed this up.  Of course,
that patch doesn't apply on this updated [1/4].  I _could_ just take the
old [1/4] (I think), but I don't know if that wouild be bisection-friendly.
Anyway, please redo&resend?  Thanks.
Please have a think about that code in arch/x86/kvm/i8254.c too.  It is
painful to see remote subsystems (re)implementing generic infrastructure.
Can KVM use existing code?  Should we hoist what KVM has done there into
generic code?  Did it have to use a(nother bleeding) macro?
