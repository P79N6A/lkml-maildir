yeah, i can reproduce this crash too.
The problem is on SMP: if sched_rr_get_interval() gets a task from an 
otherwise idle runqueue, then rq->load.weight is 0. Normally 
sched_slice() is only used on a busy runqueue. So the correct fixup site 
is not in sched_slice() but in sys_sched_rr_get_interval() - i'm working 
on the right fix, i hope to be able to send a pull request in a few 
minutes.
