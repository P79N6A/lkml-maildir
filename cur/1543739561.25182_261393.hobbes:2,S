Solution: the module loader refuses to load signed modules that are not GPLed?
I.e. a combination of MODULE_LICENSE() and signed modules.
Opens up interesting legal actions if the signature owner signs modules that
claim to be GPL, but aren't. Digital signatures are starting to become valid
signatures in many countries...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
