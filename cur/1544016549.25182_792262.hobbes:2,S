Unfortunately not, the GCC flags for CRIS only act on objects (address
of the first member in the struct), the structs themselves are
still subject to alignment on odd bytes. So the patch for aligning
all klists on 16 or 32 bits is still needed for CRIS.
It should however be a no-op for all architectures that do struct padding.
