More on the St. Valentines day massacre.....
Trying to put back together my system disk (root fs) on my home
Version 2.2.1 machine...
I am using modules for the aic7xxx SCSI device. It is found during
boot and loads fine, finding all the SCSI devices... then the
kernel panics because it can't mount a root file-system.
Here is my /etc/lilo.conf
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.1
	label=new
	root=current
	initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.1
	read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.36-0.7
	label=linux
	root=/dev/sda1
	initrd=/boot/initrd-2.0.36-0.7.img
	read-only
I created the /boot/initrd-2.2.1 using /sbin/mkinitrd script.
I tried setting root=/dev/sda1, root=current, and even root=/dev/sdb1
(thinking there may be a strange offset).
I even 'rdev'ed the kernel image. All to no avail. The second image
in lilo.conf loads fine. Asside from a different version number,
it has IDE drives in addition to SCSI. That's the only difference.
Is it possible that the device numbers get offset somehow if there
are IDE drives and /dev/sda1 isn't properly resolved at boot time?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
