True, but it seems pretty ugly to protect the ioctl32 hash with the
BKL.  I think the greater good of reducing use of the BKL should be
looked at.

I'm not sure I follow what you're saying.  When I looked at this, at
first I thought RCU would be better for the hash lookup, but I didn't
see a way to prevent a compat handler from being removed while it was
running.  That's why I moved to a semaphore, which would hold off the
removal until the handler was done running.  Is this what you mean?
Do you see a way to use RCU here?
Thanks,
  Roland
