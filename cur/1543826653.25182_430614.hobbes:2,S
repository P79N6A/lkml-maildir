Does that imply that there's no danger of cpus being hotplugged in a different 
order (so that cpu7 becomes cpu5, for example)?
I guess I'm missing an understanding of why one cpu would need a different 
configuration to the rest. If it's related to the cpu number, then it 
shouldn't matter if a different cpu gets the number, should it? If it's 
related to the node that the cpu is on, perhaps the hotplugging code for the 
driver should be checking for the reason ("Am I on the node with the... ?") 
rather than the cpu number?
Regards,
Nigel
