the problem is that this bug was only present in x86.git. I.e. neither 
2.6.24 nor 2.6.23 has this particular bug.
perhaps something else in x86.git fixed your box, but this 
x86.git-specific hang 'took over its place', and now that it got fixed, 
you've got a working box? In any case, please monitor your box, it might 
still lock up the same way it did previously ...
