Hm, I thought akpm had already fixed that -- but thanks.
His patch also changed the simple powers of ten to the slightly
confusing 'NSEC_PER_SEC' and 'USEC_PER_SEC' macros, as if those numbers
are subject to change by later decree, and shouldn't be hard-coded. I
suspect we can do without that part, although I don't really care either
way.
