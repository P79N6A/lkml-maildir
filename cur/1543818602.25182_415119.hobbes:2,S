There are no syscalls involved. It is a [arch-dependent] stack backtrace 
that walks up EBP. But object files compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer have 
random values in %ebp. So when doing
    ebp = *(void **)ebp;
it either succeeds or throws SIGSEGV. Catching signals is catchy because 
the backtrace might be done in a threaded application. Does *jmp() work 
with threads?
