With libata linked into the kernel, and ide as a module, I can boot off 
of libata.

As I said, I want to boot off of the PATA drives attached to the 
southbridge.  To boot of them, I have to have the IDE driver compiled 
into the kernel; if I do this I can't use libata on that southbridge, 
the IDE driver take precedence for the serial ata channels.
