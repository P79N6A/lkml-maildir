Food for the starving masses.
This patch prevents any single task from being able to starve the runqueue 
that it's on. This minimises the impact a poorly behaved application or a 
malicious one has on the rest of the system. If an interactive task (eg 
blender) spins on wait on a cpu hog (X), other tasks will be less affected by 
priority inversion occurring between X and blender (ie X will still suffer 
but the machine wont come to a standstill). Broken apps will improve at least 
partially with this, but they should be fixed for good performance.
Changes:
A task that uses up it's full timeslice will not be allowed to be the very 
next task scheduled unless no other tasks on that runqueue are active. This 
allows the next highest priority task to be scheduled or even an array switch 
followed by the next task.
Dropped the on runqueue bonus to high credit tasks on requeuing for timeslice 
granularity for the above to work well.
Patch O16.3-O17int and a full patch against 2.6.0-test3 is available at
