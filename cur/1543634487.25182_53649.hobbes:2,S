Absolutely. I suspect that the _real_ issues start coming up only once
people start using this for useful work, and we should just accept that
the format (for now) is in flux. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't
try to make it reasonably sane from the very start.
And make sure that the naming convention works for both IDE and SCSI (ie
there should be a way to figure out _portably_ whether a device is a disk
or CD-RW or whatever, without even knowing whether it's SCSI or IDE).
