The bloat argument was about the additional pointer in the dynamic 
data structure (on a 64bit architecture it costs 12 bytes) 
Better would be to pass the callback to kref_put(), but then it would
be even better to just test the return value (callbacks are obfuscation
and should be avoided when not needed)
