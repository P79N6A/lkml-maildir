this is obviously not 2.6.15 stuff, so we've got enough time to see the 
effects. [ And what does "I do plan to look at this" mean? When 
precisely, and can i thus go to other topics without the issue being 
dropped on the floor indefinitely? ]
also note that the inlining patch actually _reduces_ average stack 
footprint by ~3-4%:
                                            orig        +inlining
        # of functions above 256 bytes:      683              660
               total stackspace, bytes:   148492           142884
it is the unit-at-a-time patch that increases stack footprint (by about 
7-8%, which together with the inlining patch gives a net ~5%).
