All,
I did a quick look in include/linux for a standard implementation of an
array-based circular queue, but I didn't see one.
I was thinking something that could be declared, allocated, and then
used with an addq and a removeq.  A deallocator would also be good.
Is there such a beast in the kernel?  If not, it seems that having
something like this would reduce the potential for bugs.
Thoughts?
