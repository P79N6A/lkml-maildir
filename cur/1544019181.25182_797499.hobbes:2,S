All,
we're happy to announce a major rewrite of sreadahead, and the release of version
1.0. This is a significant improvement in the way sreadahead works:
* sreadahead now will work on any filesystem;
  Sreadahead used to use an ioctl to retreive inserted timestamps from ext3
  inodes. This patch is now replaced with a generic open() syscall tracer,
  which will work on all filesystems.
* pack file generation is now integrated entirely in a single binary, and
  automatically done if the pack file is missing;
  Sreadahead is now a single-binary two-purpose program that either reads in
  the content needed, or generates this content. This reduces the chance that
  sreadahead is called incorrectly, but also makes installation a lot easier.
  Sreadahead can now be added to the boot system by inserting a single line
  in a startup script.
* pack file generation is now significantly faster than the old method;
  Sreadahead now uses a kernel tracer which provides with a sort-by-use list of
  all files opened. This removes the need for a special script to discover
  which files were opened at boot. This list is sorted and filtered in C
  code inside sreadahead which proves much faster. The old method took
  multiple seconds. New method sorts/filters 10k+ open trace calls in 0.16s
  on a regular desktop.
* sreadahead now accounts for kernel read_ahead_kb, reducing data read
  at boot time;
  While sreadahead reads "used" data into memory, the kernel reports more
  memory in use than actually used due to the in-kernel readahead function.
  In order to read significantly less data, sreadahead temporarily reduces
  this amount, saving significant amount of total IO time. This saves as
  much as 8 out of 64Mb on a regular fedora core installation.
Sreadahead still depends on a kernel patch (posted in a followup). This patch
implements a global kernel tracer for sys_open() syscalls. The choice was made to
use this method since userland tracing is slow, cumbersome (have to attach to
every process running), and hard to implement for system-wide tracing (we don't
care about which process is doing something). A kernel tracer is extremely
efficient and added bonus is that we can leave the trace in memory until we
actually need to process it.
