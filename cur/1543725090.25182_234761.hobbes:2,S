There should not be any differences between module and compiled version.
Could you please change #undef DEBUG to #define DEBUG in
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c module and post the full dmesg (you may have
to use log_buf_size=131072 and 'dmesg -s 131072' to get the full dmesg).

When you reload do you do it from X or from text console? Do you have GPM
running? If some program has the device open when you reload a new device
will be created. X closes the device when switching to a text console, so
just kill GPM before reloading psmouse and it should help.
