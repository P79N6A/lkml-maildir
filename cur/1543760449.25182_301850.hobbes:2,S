My position is that
 - there are lots of things that "it'd be nice to get it fixed", and
    that is what 2.6.X is for
 - It is a very slippery slope 
 - No one expect Linux to be perfect. But people do expect it to get
   better without getting worse.  It is precisely to fix this
   expectation that (I understand) 2.6.x.y was created.
If a data corruption bug has been there for 10 weeks without being
noticed, then the real risk is not that great.  We are calling it
"-release", not "-hardened".
Just my shilling-and-six worth.
