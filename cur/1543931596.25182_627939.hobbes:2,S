Your udev rules are screwed up. In /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules, you should have a line 
that looks like
SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:1a:73:6b:28:5a", ATTR{type}=="1", NAME="eth1"
with the MAC address for your device. You probably have the ATTR{type}=="1" clause missing.
