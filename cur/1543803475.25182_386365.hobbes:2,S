On my i386 box with an ati radeon 9600 agp card of sorts trying to use the 
radeon driver (ever since I installed suse 10.0) causes an immediate hard 
lockup on startup of X.  Sounds like your problem...  Setting the driver 
to VESA or using the ati proprietory driver works fine (but only the ati 
driver actually is usable for me).
You could try that and if the others work for you like for me then it is 
likely the problem is indeed 100% in the radeon driver somewhere...
Best regards,
