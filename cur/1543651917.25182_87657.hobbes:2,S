Hi Linus,
The following patches are bug fixes and updates to the ext2/3 filesystem
code.  Please apply them, or pull from 
       bk://extfs.bkbits.net/extfs-2.5-update
This should address some of the filesystem corruption problems with the
htree code that have been reported in the 2.5 kernel sources.
Note that the last patch is substantially similar to the which Andrew
Morton just sent you; he and I happened to end up working on the same
bug in parallel at the same time, and arrivced at the same conclusion
and substantially the same patch.  My patch simplifies the code a bit
more than his does, in that it removing some unused variables, but
either one should fix the problem.
