Subject: [patch] "big IRQ lock" removal, 2.5.27-A9
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/7/21/125

the genhd.c bit is safe as well, removed the comment. Only the tty and the
ide/main.c changes are left the 'dubious' category - everything else is
supposed to be safe. (and of course there's all the other stuff that does
not compile at the moment.) Latest patch is at:
