Since it's not THE ONLY function in kernel API. There are exist high-level
functions to do a lot of stuff in kernel. THIS functions (called HDIO_DRIVE_CMD)
does EXACTLY what it promises: it delivers command from program to IDE bus.
It was DESIGNED to do so. When you do not need this low-level function you
are using other, more high-level functions.

Sorry. Either Linux comply to standards or not. Either MB comply to standards
or not. There are no place for differen opinions. MB interaface was designed
to deliver raw commond to IDE bus and the same is true for HDIO_DRIVE_CMD as
well. Other, more high-level linux functions WILL NOT issue non-ATAPI-compilant
commands to bus but HDIO_DRIVE_CMD is just pipe from userland programs to IDE
bus. Yes, it's dangerous function, yes, it must be restricted only to processes
with CAP_SYS_RAW but if you think that such function in API render Linux to be
non-compiant then your MB is also non-compiant. It's as simple as it is.
