Correct, although the semantics of the two flags aren't exactly the same.

I did it that way in the patch because it was the only simple choice.  The 
scsi_test_unit_ready() routine is part of the SCSI core and can be called 
for devices that aren't disks.  Hence any flag it sets cannot be part of 
the scsi_disk structure.
In principle the information could be conveyed in the return value from 
scsi_test_unit_ready() rather than in a static flag.  But the routine has 
several callers and I didn't want to change all of them to recognize a 
-ENOMEDIUM return code.  Now in the long run, perhaps that would be a good 
thing to do.  Or perhaps moving the flag to scsi_device would be better, I 
don't know...
Ultimately this boils down to how you want to represent "No medium 
present" in the SCSI core.  What do you think is the bets way?
