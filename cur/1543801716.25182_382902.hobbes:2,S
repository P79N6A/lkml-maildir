If an option is untested it's EXPERIMENTAL.
If it's broken it's BROKEN.
If an option is marked as BROKEN but works fine for you please send a 
bug report.

It's so broken that a devloper said EXPERIMENTAL is not enough, users 
should really not see it. Often the developer additionall added an

It might be marked as BROKEN because it crashes the kernel.
But well, the common case is that the code marked as BROKEN simply 
doesn't compile.
