yeah. I first hacked the generic check then saw how ugly the end result 
was and moved it one level higher. Which was less ugly than where it came 
from and not much worse than the starting point (so it passed my filters) 
but still not clean enough (so it didnt pass your filters).
How about the patch below instead? It cleans up the generic check by 
splitting all the per-major-version checks out into gcc4 and gcc3.
(still untested)

Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: Disallow GCC 4.1.0 / 4.1.1
Impact: fix crashes that can trigger if built with GCC 4.1.0 or 4.1.1
GCC 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 has a bug that can miscompile __weak symbols,
by inlining __weak functions into same-file call sites - breaking the
kernel if the __weak symbol is overriden later on.
In the past we tried to work around this problem by artificially
isolating call site and definition site - but these bugs tend to
pop up regularly:
 43a2563: sparseirq: move __weak symbols into separate compilation unit
 13a0c3c: sparseirq: work around compiler optimizing away __weak functions
And Linus has extended Sparse to report same-file callsites for __weak
symbols - which gave two dozen hits.
We have not found a clean way to work around this bug on the source
code level (noinline and explicit barrier()s are ignored by GCC), so we do
not allow these compilers (which are quite rare these days, have other bugs
and are superceded by the 4.1.2 bugfix release anyway).
Kernel builds under gcc 410 or 411 will now fail with this error message:
  Sorry, GCC 4.1.0/4.1.1 are too buggy to build the kernel - please
  upgrade to 4.1.2 or later versions.
