stock 2.6 rwsem implementation compiled for PII (I still have tons of
patches to forward port from 2.4-aa, if I would port my rwsem to 2.6 I
would have never noticed this race)

no, there should be around 10k processes, sure not more than 20k.

yes:
strace:

it's the down_read in proc_pid_stat. the workload running at the same
time is heavy remap_file_pages. They're processes so the only race
happens against the /proc filesystem and that's why it hangs there.
Somehow downgrade_write in remap_file_pages races with down_read in
/proc. My patch workarounds the deadlock by not calling downgrade_write,
but I posted it to l-k because my code is better anyways since there's
no good reason to ever call down_write in the fast path (and if we don't
start down_write we don't need downgrade_write anymore). The only thing
bitten by downgrade_write left is xfs.
You can imagine which is the critical apps that triggers this deadlock,
not many apps are using remap_file_pages in production yet, and very few
are going to call it in a flood.
I agree with Andrew the limit of 32k processes needs fixing, but nobody
noticed yet with any real app, so it's a low prio matter.
