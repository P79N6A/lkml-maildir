I finally booted 2.6.0-test1-mm2, after reading somebody else who needed to 
use hex in the root= argument.  root=/dev/hdb1 and root=hdb2 would panic 
("VFS: Cannot open root device hdb1 or unknown-block(0,0)"), but root=0341 
worked.  Devfs is compiled in, devfs=nomount and devfs=mount make no 
difference.  Is this intentional?
