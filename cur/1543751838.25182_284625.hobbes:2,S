The Linux kernel STRIP module was updated to support the newer series of Ricochet modems in January of 2002 by a person about whom I can find nothing more than a username of `abelits'. Anyway, he wasn't smart about it and didn't submit his patch to the LKML. When the existing drivers were migrated to the 2.6 tree, the old version of the module was migrated, and that's where the problems began.
`abelits' provides a patch for 2.4.1, though it applies cleanly to the recent 2.4 kernels with just a little fuzz. However, the 2.6 version of strip.c is significantly different from the 2.4 version. Most structures in the diff are easy enough to find in the new version of the source, so I tried hand-merging the differences. Unfortunately, given my limited knowledge of C, I wasn't able to get anywhere with it.
I attached copy of the patch and the link to the source of the patch's origin in the hopes that someone can migrate this driver to the current source tree and possibly merge it into both 2.4 and 2.6 production kernels. I can UPS a modem to someone if that's the real problem. If this idea is feasible at all, please reply.

Look near the bottom, section 8.4.
