At that point it is better to extend the fingerprint size, since the SHA1
algorithm has a better distribution compared to md5 and crc32. Probability
estimates are pretty low though. If you consider a 2^32 blocks FS, that
with a 4Kb block size makes a 4 tera FS, the collision probability is in
the orders of 2^(-95) (with a 160 bit fingerprint). That's a pretty low
number. Yes, it is true that the input is not completely random, but a
good property of SHA1 is the one of spreading output result of very
similar input patterns.
