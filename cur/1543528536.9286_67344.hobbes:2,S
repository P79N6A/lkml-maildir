After digging through include/linux/list.h enough, I realized that the
nbd_device's queue_head's ->prev and ->next should *never* get to a
state of being NULL.
It looks like we simply never initialize the doubly-linked list so
that ->prev and ->next initialize to the location of queue_head itself,
which is the correct state for an empty list.  This led to list_empty
never returning true, since ->next was never getting set to queue_head,
so the driver would try processing queue entries that simply didn't exist.
