Yes, that is my recommendation.

Huh?  You are still doing that same "filtering/lookup" by modifying the
maps code.  The result should be exactly the same.
Why do you not want to use the LSM interface?  That is exactly what it
is there for, don't go creating new hooks into the kernel for the exact
same functionality.
Opening a dev node is not on any "fast path" that you need to be
concerned about a few extra calls within the kernel.
And, I think in the end your patch would be much smaller and easier to
understand and review and maintain overall.

That's fine, use the LSM interface, no need to change userspace at all.
Although I think your requirement of using new kernels on very old
distros is going to cause you more problems than you realize in the
end...
