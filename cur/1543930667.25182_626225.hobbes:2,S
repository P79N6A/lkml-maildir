I spent 3 mail explaining it as clearly as I could. So you're welcome
for the review and the reminder of why it's impossible to have a normal
conversation with you.

Precisely. So forgive me for thinking this patch hasn't seen very varied
testing, that's 2 errors (one simple, one bad - broken was NOT a gross
exageration, thanks) in very few lines.

I still wish there was a way around this, you are bloating the bio by
about 15% (yeah I know you rambled on about this, but still). Better
placement would help, so there's still low hanging fruit available.
