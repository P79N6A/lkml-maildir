This is not the case, thanks  to autoconf and pkg-config. On one of my
systems, I have all the  binaries under /Library/..., and all the libs
under     /Frameworks/...,     and      the     doc     goes     under
/Library/Documentation/someplace...
It's not a problem any more, thanks to the ongoing modularization.
