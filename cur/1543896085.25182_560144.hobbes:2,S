Subject: Request for Linux Kernel Mailing List archives
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/20/164

I would like to make a request to LKML archives.  It would be a highly
useful feature to have an archive site where one can algorithmically
produce a URL from the Message-ID, so one can post a clickable URL from
a delivered message without having to look it up every time.
For example, if a message had:
Message-ID: <4676C78D.8040208@zytor.com>
... and I could just generate a URL:
http://linux-kernel.example.com/msgid/4676C78D.8040208@zytor.com
... that would be highly convenient.
(Extra points if all the vger lists are available, not just LKML.)
