Subject: [PATCH] i386: fix file_read_actor() and pipe_read()  for original i386 systems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/2/164

The __copy_to_user_inatomic() calls in file_read_actor() and pipe_read()
are broken on original i386 machines, where WP-works-ok == false, as
__copy_to_user_inatomic() on such systems calls functions which might
sleep and/or contain cond_resched() calls inside of a kmap_atomic()
region.
The original check for WP-works-ok was in access_ok(), but got moved
during the 2.5 series to fix a race vs. swap.
Return the number of bytes to copy in the case where we are in an atomic
region, so the non atomic code pathes in file_read_actor() and
pipe_read() are taken.
This could be optimized to avoid the kmap_atomicby moving the check for
WP-works-ok into fault_in_pages_writeable(), but this is more intrusive
and can be done later.
