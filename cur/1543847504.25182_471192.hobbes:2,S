I think it should be safe so long as the entire mapping has been
unmapped. After that, there is no read path that should care about
that flag bit. So long as it is well commented (and maybe done via
a helper in mm/memory.c), I can't yet see a problem with it.

When you drop and retake the mmap_sem, you need to start again from
find_vma. At which point you technically probably want to start again
from the architecture specfic fault code. It sounds difficult but I
won't say it can't be done.
