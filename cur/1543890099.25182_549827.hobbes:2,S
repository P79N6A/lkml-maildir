I just stared at the drivers/serial/suncore.s assembler a little
bit and this is indeed what appears to be happening, the compiler
is optimizing the stores away completely yet not doing so much
as emitting a warning, how rude :-)
Perhaps there is some warning option that isn't enabled which
would have caught this...
Thanks a lot for your patch, I'll apply it.
