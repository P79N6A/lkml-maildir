That's the right idea!  But remember that not all GPIOs support
reading back the actual value on SCL (it's an OUT pin, so lacking
multidrive capability the values "should" be what you wrote), so
getscl() support should depend on a flag in platform data.  In
the same vein, if SCL is an output-only pin, you won't be able
to change its direction ... but then, I'm not sure why you were
changing its direction in setscl() rather than just its value.
I2C has another interesting special case.  at91_set_multi_drive()
would be appropriate (yes?) for ARCH_AT91 to use on SCL, to best
support both clock stretching and multi-master configurations.

Surely you mean "output" in both cases.  So you can set the
value.  Setting the value on an input pin is undefined.  ;)

Please, no hex there.  I think dev_info() would be better; and it
might be nice to report whether clock stretching is supported.

It'd be nice to completely abolish those IDs, starting by not
adding new ones.  Especially, not adding unused ones!
