And while you're at it, please add isa_{request,release}_mem_region() as well.
Reasoning: while we can (and do) make ioremap(0xa0000, ...) work fine on PPC
(you must not use ioremap() for RAM, so it must be ISA memory space), we can't
distinguish between the first 16 MB of RAM and ISA memory space for
{request,release}_mem_region()...
