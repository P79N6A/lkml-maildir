Hello,
while developing a compiler (www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sacbase),
a problem with newer linux-kernels occured.
I tracked it down to the following:
Using this small program to test it, the executiontime on Linux <= 2.1.126
and on Sparc-Solaris is nearly 1ms.
Since 2.1.127 the time is 5 seconds, whoch means 10ms per sleep(0).
-------------------- 8< ------------------------
int main()
{
  int i;
  for (i=0; i<=500; i++)
    {
      sleep(0);
    }
 return(0);
}
-------------------- 8< ------------------------
Viewing it in strace results in nanosleep(0,0).
The manpage for nanosleep() says, the (sleep-)time may increase up to one
cycle (10ms)  (Linux-man and Solaris-man). 
I inserted a line like
if(arg==0) return 0;  
to sys_nanosleep() in sched.c, and the "problem" was fixed.
It surely does not make sense to call sleep(0), but in that case,
it would be nice to return emmediatly.
Are there any oposite oppinions ? 
Could that fix be included into the official kernel ?
