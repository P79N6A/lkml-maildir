Andy,
Look more closely at my earlier table. 
Regardless of what the answer to your question is, the 
current semantics are bizarre.  As things stand, a process
can open a file O_RDWR, and and can place a WRITE lease 
but not a READ lease.  That can't be right.
FWIW it's worth, I think the read lease should be allowed.
Oplocks are concerned with what other processes are doing, 
not what the caller is doing.  Also, the current semantcis
break backward compatibility.
Cheers,
Michael
