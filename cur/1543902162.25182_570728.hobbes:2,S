Yes, I see it on any kernel.

Well, yes:
In file kernel/qpixmap_x11.cpp, line 633: Out of memory
QImage::convertDepth: Image is a null image

And no, my 2 GB of RAM are not full:

hm, I dont have any webspace...

I now made some new strace logs:
- konq crash 251K
- Konq without crash on cfs 302K
- konq without crash on non-cfs 248K
