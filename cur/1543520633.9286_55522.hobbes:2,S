And if you don't have a spare machine to devote to running new kernels, you 
could always use my user-mode port of the kernel.  It runs the kernel in a set 
of processes.
The catch is that it needs either 2.3.21 as the hosting kernel or you need to 
apply a patch to it.  If patching kernels is beyond your skill, then wait till 
distributions start shipping 2.3.21 or later (which will probably be 
2.4.something), grab my kernel, and start banging on it.
