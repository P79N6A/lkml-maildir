Another 'error' you may want to silence some time is the one
that appears when you query SMART status of a recent IBM drive.
hde: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
This happens if the drive is SMART capable, but not SMART enabled,
and you ask it if it can do SMART.  Once you enable it, subsequent
queries work without spitting out the error.
(Unless you turn it off again)
I'm not sure if this a quirk of these drives (I've not seen it happen
on any other vendor), or the code.
regards,
Dave.
