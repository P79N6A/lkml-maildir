I use grey on black, and a font with reasonably thick vertical lines
(9x15bold).  This works nicely on a large CRT, which tends to make
vertical lines thinner again due to horizontal blurring.
White is just too bright for that.  (Not so with thinner letters, but
then they are out of focus on the CRTs I use, which btw are rather good
ones).  White background is equally just too bright.
Ok it's possible to turn down the monitor (though on my laptop it
isn't).  But then everything non-textual is too dim.  There's no reason
to make the text the brightest thing, as it covers the whole screen
anyway.  Oh, you guessed I use Emacs and xterm ;-)
Basically, I take the Linux VGA console as guide: grey text on black,
white text for bold, thick vertical bars in a good font.  It works very
nicely for me.
