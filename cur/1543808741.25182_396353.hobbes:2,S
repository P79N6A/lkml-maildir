During suspend the hardware is usually completely powered off, and in 
either case, there is nothing running on the CPU to monitor device 
insertion/removal.  When the system is resumed the kernel decides if the 
hardware has changed the same way for either system: it probes the 
hardware to see if it is still there.  There isn't anything special that 
monitors device insertion/removal while suspended to ram.

If it doesn't work then you have found a bug and should file a report. 
The state of the kernel after resuming from either suspend to disk, or 
suspend to ram is the same.  The filesystem is still mounted, and any 
dirty pages in ram will be flushed just like normal.  Whether the disk 
is connected via SCSI, SATA, USB, or whatever does not matter.

The kernel knows that the same device is still there on the bus, and so 
it picks up right where it left off.  If it thinks the device has been 
unplugged and reconnected, that is a bug.
