Matt, you tickled a thought... on one hand we have a single user running 
a threaded application, and it ideally should get the same total CPU as 
a user running a single thread process. On the other hand we have a 
threaded application, call it sendmail, nnrpd, httpd, bind, whatever. In 
that case each thread is really providing service for an independent 
user, and should get an appropriate share of the CPU.
Perhaps the solution is to add a means for identifying server processes, 
by capability, or by membership in a "server" group, or by having the 
initiating process set some flag at exec() time. That doesn't 
necessarily solve problems, but it may provide more information to allow 
them to be soluble.
