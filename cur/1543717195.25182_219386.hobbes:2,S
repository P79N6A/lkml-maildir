What happens is that after the int 0x80 the CPU is in ring 0 (you
don't get an trace event in that mode unless you use a kernel debugger). 
Then when the kernel returns the last instruction executed before it is an 
IRET. But the IRET is also executed still in ring 0 and you should not get 
an event for it (you can not even access its code from user space).
So it's expected behaviour.
