On Alpha machines (ev4 and ev56), it seems actually to be the opposite
on integer calculation: gcc-3.0 produces code up to 5% faster than
gcc-2.95.2. The result is still 25% behind the Compaq C compiler,
though.
By the way, the installation procedure is mostly buggy on old Alpha
systems (RedHat 5.1 -> binutils 2.9, glibc 2.0.7). I do not mind gcc
having some requirements about versions of such other tools, but it
could be made a bit more explicit, and the configuration script should
also emit some warnings (it detects the versions installed, it just does
not bother reporting the potential problem).
