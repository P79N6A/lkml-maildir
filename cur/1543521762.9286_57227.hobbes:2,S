The Raid drivers dont address this problem - It is seem with the LVM
and the raid code (New and Old afaik).
There has been a dirty fix a couple of days ago ... I found it on deja.com

This fix is probably only a pointer to the right direction
This problem basically prevents us from using raid0s of raid5s which
i tried (but failed). It occures with the LVM under high load as
Heinz told me. 2.2 is also affected.
