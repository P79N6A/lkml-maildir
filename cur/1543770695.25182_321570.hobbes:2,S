The biggest improvement comes because the drives that ship with the
newer bus technology are newer internally too, they aren't just
repackaged older technology.
Today's current generation products (SATA and PATA100/133) can sustain
over 60MB/s datarates, and the next will probably be even higher.
The drive that could only do UDMA/33 is probably of a disk technology
around 15MB/s or worse.
Today's newest drives are quite fast.
