Indeed - it has been documented since the days of Stevens at least. All
unixes that matter have it.
From the application side, I pretty much really want pselect to work. It is
an embarassment to have a broken implementation, if we really think pselect
sucks we should deprecate it in glibc.
So, please, consider merging the patches.. ppoll is something else, I never
heard about it, but pselect is widely known.
Thanks.
