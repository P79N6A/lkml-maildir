Hi,
I was having some little trouble with the QLOGIC Fibre Channel SCSI
cards.
The issue is, that I have a box with an internal SCSI controller/disk
and
a QLOGIC card which is connected to an external RAID. The probelm is,
that the internal disk is my root disk but is the second in the chain
(sdb)
after bootup. This gives a lot of problems, because it's impossible to
get
the system to boot (LILO isn't working).
Since I've modified the hosts.c it's working perfectly (at least the
order
is better now). Patch is attached.
Can anyone give a comment on that please ?
	CU, Klaus
