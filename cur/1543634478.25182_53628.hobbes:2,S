I'm don't have much visibility into this platform's journaling requirements.
I suspect its to enable fast reboot / recovery from some klutz bumping the
power cord or a crash of some sort.
I will raise the issue with the platform folks.  However; for now I'm
looking for ways to make it scale competitively WRT adapters and spindles
for writes without changing the file system.  If this turns out to be a dead
end then, hopefully, we'll move to a more spindle friendly file system.
The workload is
