The idiom used in the kernel for such code is "global code and compile 
the files separately". The expected inclusion for a C file into the 
kernel is through the Makefile, and everything else is surprising when 
looking through the code.
"artificial interfaces" is not a problem since these are completely 
private interfaces you can change at any time.
