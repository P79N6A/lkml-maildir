That balance code is probably the IDE or SCSI channel balancing?
In that case, the driver simply wants to know which device it
should service next, which is an appropriate fit (is that what
you were talking about? I don't have source here sorry)
We could ask the elevator if a given read is a good fit. It
would probably help.

How so? Basically you want your high level scheduler to run first.
You want it to act on the stream of requests from the system, not
on the stream of requests to the device. If you know what I mean.
I might be wrong here. I haven't done any testing, and only a
little bit of thinking.

The problem I see, is the higher level schedulers (deadline for
example, as opposed to the RAID scheduler) will find it difficult
to tell if a request will be "good" for them or not. For example
we have 2 devices, 100 requests in each scheduler queue.
Device A's head is at sector x and next request is at x+100,
Device B's head is at sector x+10 and next request is at x+200.
RAID wants to know which queue should take a request at sector
x+1000. What do you do?
The way you would do a good "goodness" function, I guess,
would be to search through all requests on the device, and return
the minimum distance from the request you are running the query
on. Do this for both queues, and insert the request into the
queue with the smallest delta. I don't see much else doing any
good.
On the other hand, if you simply have a fifo after the RAID
scheduler, the RAID scheduler itself knows where each disk's
head will end up simply by tracking the value of the last
sector it has submitted to the device. It also has the advantage
that it doesn't have "high level" scheduling stuff below it
ie. request deadline handling, elevator scheme, etc.
This gives the RAID scheduler more information, without
taking any away from the high level scheduler AFAIKS.
