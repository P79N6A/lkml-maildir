Yes, sorry, you do do that.

Well, as Rob Landley pointed out, /dev is not necessarily the same across
the entire system. I don't know if this is a problem (is sysfs going to be
visible in a chrooted environment anyway?), but I take it as an indication
that /dev shouldn't be any of the kernel's business.

It is rather ugly to duplicate the directory tree. But it is better
than mission-creep of sysfs. And userspace has to maintain its own view
(or views) of devices anyway: GUIs may want to allow users to assign icons
to devices, or descriptive strings, or who knows what else. That
definitely shouldn't live in sysfs.

No I don't trust udevinfo to have a stable interface. And that would be
a useful thing to have even if HAL is the only consumer. I suspect it would
be nice for all udev-like solutions to share the same interface. I'm just
hesitant to put forward my suggestion as the right interface.
I'd suggest answer 2 for the problem -- Hal knows it, ask him -- though
that's easy enough to say when I'm not writing the hypothetical program.
Hal can then worry about finding and integrating information about devices
in disparate places. If Hal doesn't provide a suitable interface, that
should be fixed.
