Like USB peripheral controllers.  Only one external "B" type
connector is allowed.

There were other devices with similar issues.

For that matter, a *driver* should never create its own device node(s)
in the first place.  Device creation belongs elsewhere, like as part of
platform setup or, for busses with integral enumeration support like
PCI or USB, bus glue.  Linux is moving away from that legacy model.
I realize that may be more easily said than done in some cases,
like i8042 on non-PNP systems.
