Backed out (via reversing the patch), but the problem still occurs
(which makes the following observation from David Miller, while true,
possibly not relevant):

Incidently, the same memory leak occurs while running with the
latest-and-greatest version of rtl8139.c (v. 1.08a; from Donald Becker's
website).  Also recall that the 2.2.11 patch, as delivered, runs fine on
the same box under Mandrake 6.0...

Multicast is the only one set (CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y).  I don't use it,
but I'll have to ask our network admin guy whether or not there is
actually any multicast traffic on our LAN. Since he's likely asleep now,
I'll have to ask him tomorrow :-)
