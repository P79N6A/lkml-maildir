Subject: raid subsystem broken in 2.5.43... blockdev changes?

Hi Al, list,
I think the latest blockdev (maybe the do_open) changes broke the raid
subsystem.  In order to 'activate' a raid device, the userland tools open
the device node (e.g. /dev/md0) to perform ioctls against it, even though
that device isn't up and running yet.  In 2.5.43 it returns ENXIO.
In 2.5.42 we used to get through to bdev->bd_op->open() without a 
'gendisk' structure, but now we bail with ENXIO.  Is this the pertinent 
difference?
David
