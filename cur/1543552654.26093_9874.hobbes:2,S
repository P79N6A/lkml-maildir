It means something in the system is trying to allocate a
large continuous area of memory that isn't available...
The printk is basically a debug output indicating that we
don't have the large physically contiguous area available
that's being requested.
Basically everything bigger than order-1 (2 contiguous
pages) is unreliable at runtime. Orders 2 and 3 should
usually be available (if you only allocate very few of
them) and higher orders should not be relied upon.
If somebody is seeing a lot of these messages, it means
that some driver in the system is asking unreasonable
things from the VM subsystem ;)
(and buffer allocations are failing)
regards,
Rik
