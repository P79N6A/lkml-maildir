As far as I know, these chips get RDTSC right 100% of the time:
Any Intel chip
AMD K6-[123]
AMD K5 [stepping above 0]
IDT WinChip [stepping above 0] and WinChip 2
Later revision Cyrix chips
As far as I know, these chips get RDTSC wrong:
AMD K5 stepping 0
IDT WinChip stepping 0
Early Cyrix 6x86, MediaGX
These chips don't support RDTSC:
AMD 5x86, Cyrix 5x86, any i486
