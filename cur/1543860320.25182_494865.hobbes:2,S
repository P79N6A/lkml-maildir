kvm: disabled by bios
I know this has been asked before and the answer was no. Does it still
stand or is there a way to bypass the bios? I'm using Lenovo X60s and
there's no option to enable VT in the BIOS setup.
/proc/cpuinfo shows "VMX".
Another question ... how to enable "mouse" in KVM?
Thanks,
Jeff.
