So sad...  Ever since I started with kernel 2.5.69, the kernel has been 
properly reserving IRQ 5 for ISA, as set in my BIOS.
Unfortunately for me, it looks like 2.6.0-test3-mm3 is like 2.4.18 and 
ignores my BIOS settings, so it locks up trying to ativate my SB16 on 
boot (since IRQ 5 is used for IDE).  Oddly it doesn't spit out any 
warnings, just locks up after "pnp: Device 00:01.03 activated". 
I used "pci=irqmask=0xffdf" in 2.4.18, but that doesn't seem to work for 
2.6.0-test3-mm3.  I'm not positive I'm giving it the correct value 
though...so maybe that's the problem.
I'd really like to try out the O17int version of mm3, but I don't want 
to disable sound either.
Thanks!
Wes
