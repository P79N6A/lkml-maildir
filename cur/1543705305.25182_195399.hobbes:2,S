Hi all...
It looks like haldaemon is polling my zip to see inserted disks
(it is the only hadware I have that uses ide-floppy).
I get a message like this
Feb  1 23:50:15 werewolf kernel: ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc =  0, key =  2, asc = 3a, ascq =  0
Feb  1 23:50:15 werewolf kernel: ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 1b, key =  2, asc = 3a, ascq =  0
Feb  1 23:50:15 werewolf kernel: hdd: No disk in drive
every 2 seconds, both in messages and syslog.
They can grow very large after some uptime ;)
What is the policy here ? Kill the message in ide-floppy.c ?
I suppose there can be some other similat messages around there...
TIA
