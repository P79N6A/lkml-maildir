Indeed. I'm confused by semantics of ALIGN macro, as from C arithmetic
side, as from using side. Former confusion also yields patches like
(Fix 'ALIGN()' macro, take 2), fixing that, i was wonder about.
BALIGN is like do-this alignment, and must be
    void do_align(what, bits)
instead. While clear arithmetic (optimized in assembler, shifts are
C shifts!), it fails in value(alignment(what, how)) kind of thing.

Via typeof() *feature* and 1U, 1UL, 1ULL *things*, i (we?) have that, what
is described above.
Examples of using ALIGN. As that, i've picked earlier,
arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:                  addr = ALIGN(addr+1,1UL<<HTLB_AREA_SHIFT);
arch/powerpc/mm/hugetlbpage.c:                  addr = ALIGN(addr+1,1<<SID_SHIFT);
mixes two things, and i can't understand what is meant here,
lib/swiotlb.c:          io_tlb_nslabs = ALIGN(io_tlb_nslabs, IO_TLB_SEGSIZE);
lib/swiotlb.c:          io_tlb_nslabs = ALIGN(io_tlb_nslabs, IO_TLB_SEGSIZE);
lib/swiotlb.c:          io_tlb_nslabs = ALIGN(io_tlb_nslabs, IO_TLB_SEGSIZE);
clear "do align", etc.
So, maybe spitting "do align" (with C shifts, without C arithmetics
error-prone-due-to-C magic) and "alignment" isn't a bad idea.
Easiness is what i wanted to have. For example, like in this clean up,
'proper memory-mapped accesses rather than making up our own "volatile"
pointers' in 6c0ffb9d2fd987c79c6cbb81c3f3011c63749b1a. Clear C-vs-call()
rewrite.
Sorry, if i'm barking up the wrong tree here.
