    no, sorry for being unclear: after having two
  ibm drives (75gxp, then 60gxp) which caused troubles 
  he replaced 60 gxp to quantum AS... (quantum AS is
  quite okay now... :)
    i meant that we had these drives simultaneously:
  i bought 75gxp, so he did. he replaced it to 60gxp
  due to failures, so did i. and now he replaced his
  60gxp to quantum-AS. and i still own 60gxp
  (and hoping that noudma will help)...
