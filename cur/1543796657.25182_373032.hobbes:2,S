This is __not__ "yet another stack". It is an _extension_.
It is all about management frames, which the in-kernel code
does not manage.
We want a working device. The driver is in a state where it
is more or less usable. What is missing, is code to handle
management.
We tried the code from the RTL driver, but it is total crap.
We dropped it again. We thought about using yet another out of
kernel ieee80211 stack, but we began to write an extension
to the in-kernel code. If that was right or wrong, well, that's
the question.
If you _really_ think we should have used $EXTERNAL_STACK,
go and patch the driver to work with it. I would really like
to see it working. It is easy to change the used 80211 stack,
as it is only a task of replacing TX and RX function calls
(and a few parameter settings to the ieee struct on init).
PS: I forgot to mention in the announcement, that the driver has
problems with OFDM (that are all 802.11g) rates. So use 802.11b
rates. 11MBit works fine.
