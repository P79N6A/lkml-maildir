Note that *I* wasn't the one who changed it from PAGE_CACHE_SIZE to (1
<< inode->i_blkbits).  This was done by Andrew.  (See below, from an
e-mail dated September 19th).
Given that Steve French was cc'ed, I assume this was done as a hack to
fix CIFS, but it was a bad idea; I agree that PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is a way
better default than (1 << inode->i_blkbits).
As far as fixing all of the other filesystems, I did *try*; I know I
screwed up with XFS, but that's because I still think the code is a
screaming horror of indirections that make it impossible to understand
what the heck is going on, and I guess I screwed up with CIFS.  Some
of the changes away from "pre inode diet" state were deliberate,
though, since some filesystems had very clearly broken "optimal I/O
sizes" of 512, and one even had something incredibly bogus that was
something like 96 bytes (!) if I remember correctly.
