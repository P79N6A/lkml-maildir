I am experiencing similar problems with 2.4.18 as a client (the NFS
server is on Solaris). When the client freezes I see nfsstat 'client rpc
retrans' counting fast. I found a quite strange way to unlock the
machine, by performing a port scan with nmap from elsewhere.
BTW, which Gigabit ethernet do you use, I use tg3, there could be a
relation to the network card?
Cheers,
