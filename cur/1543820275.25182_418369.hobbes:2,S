The relocation sounds strange (and isn't visible in your dmesg that I can 
see). But it _should_ be perfectly fine: it's moving the ROM from the 
non-prefetchable region of the 00:1e.0 bridge into the prefetchable one. 
I don't see quite why it would do it (yes, ROM's are prefetchable, but the 
old location was _valid_, and I don't see why we didn't re-use it), but it 
_really_ shouldn't matter. 
I would expect some silly interaction with X, as usual. It would be nice 
to see the whole dmesg, especially with the debugging messages - I suspect 
the remapping of the ROM happens only when X starts up, and that your 
dmesg is from just the kernel boot from before that?
But it might be that I just missed it (or that we don't have good debug 
output for that case).

Exactly the same deal. It's moved from non-prefetchable to prefetchable.
That said, the PDC202xx driver doesn't even _use_ the ROM resource, so I 
don't see why it bothers to enable it.
You can try this stupid patch to see if it moves the ROM resource back 
into the non-prefetchable region. Maybe it matters even if it shouldn't.
