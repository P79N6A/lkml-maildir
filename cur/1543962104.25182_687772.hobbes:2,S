Subject: This month's price for the most useless new Kconfig help text ...

<drumroll> ... gets CONFIG_ACCESSIBILITY
menuconfig ACCESSIBILITY
        bool "Accessibility support"
        ---help---
          Enable a submenu where accessibility items may be enabled.
One can only guess what is meant by accessbility when asked that 
by oldconfig (don't explain, I know it now) and the help text has about 0% 
additional information over the CONFIG name.
Can the help text be improved please? It should explain that accessibility in 
this case means braille device drivers and possibly other similar devices.
Thanks,
-Andi
