Definitely not.  RedHat 7.1 default install uses 2.4.2 kernel with
ipchains.  You can also say "service ipchains stop; rmmod ipchains; 
service iptables start" and switch without rebooting;  The KEY is
to remove all ipchains modules before loading the iptables ones.
It works, I do this on a regular basis.

If the above does not solve your problem, make sure you are configuring
the kernel properly.  One easy way to do this is to take a working
config - the kernel-source-2.4.XXX.i386.rpm from redhat 7.1 contains
an extra directory /config with the actual .config files used to compile
redhat kernels (BTW anyone know why I can't do rpm --rebuild with the
kernels in RH7.1?)  You should use these as an example. (or some
other documentation) Once again, this DOES work (anyone- is there
some issue specifically with 2.4.10?)
