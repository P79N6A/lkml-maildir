Hi,
I am having trouble with a dual PII-450Mhz box, with 4 SCSI disks 
(totalling 22 GB). It has 31.000 e-mail and web accounts (!), and currently 
runs vanilla 2.2.11. The machine is quite heavily loaded, with load 
averages from 2 to 4, depending on the time of the day. Every now and then, 
on average 2 to 3 times per day, it just locks up with the following on the 
console:
wait_on_bh; CPU 0:
irq:    0       [0      0]
bh:    1       [0      1]
<[c010b24d]><[c014d9a6]><[c014d942]><[c012799f]><[c0128bbf]><[c0127a1a]>
<[c0127a84]><[c010915c]>
The machine is locked solid. Doesn't respond to ping anymore.
I've looked up these addresses in the System.map file:
<[c010b210]>: 	synchronize_bh
<[c014d8f8]>: 		sock_poll
<[c014d91c]>: 	sock_close
<[c0127980]>:		__fput
<[c0128ba8]>:		fput
<[c01279c8]>:		filp_close
<[c0127a24]>:		sys_close
<[c0109128]>:		sys_call
I have seen reports of this problem earlier this year on this list, with 
early 2.2.x kernels, but couldn't find a solution. Has anyone experienced 
this with 2.2.11?
The box used to run 2.0.36, and was stable - uptimes of months. But the 
load became too big, so we had to upgrade to a 2.2 kernel for better SMP 
support. The hardware has not been changed.
I would be most grateful for any comments,
Ward Vandewege.
