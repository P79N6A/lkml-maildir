Heh ... I guess I appeared a trifle _too_ fanatic there, but I'm not.
That rant against it was actually more about controlling its
{ab-,mis-}use and rampant proliferation (even to cases where it is
inapplicable / avoidable) than removing it altogether. Especially,
when a developer is lazy / wrong and mixes select and depends in the
same dependency chain leading to errors.

(That bit about a developer _knowing_ which libraries to select
manually before selecting a driver is not really true, you can "?" on
a config item and get all its "depends" and "select" dependencies
anyway -- and it requires more leg work, yes, but then you'll never
have build failures either)
Still, I don't really disagree w.r.t. "select"ing libraries, as long
as we're careful to limit them to _only_ libraries.
