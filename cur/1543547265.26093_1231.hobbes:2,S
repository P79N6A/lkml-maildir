Tsk. Showing my age and ignorance, I guess. I was using the gcc -v trick back
at Auspex in '93. ...Guess the compiler driver has gotten smarter since.
You know how it goes- you do a trick once- you don't change it for years...

That's the point. The support routines are paired with the compiler, not the
kernel. And the support routines have to be able to link with the
kernel. Having 20 different kernel platforms duplicate code already in
libgcc.a is silly unless the code in libgcc.a is so bad for the kernel that
you have to do otherwise.
