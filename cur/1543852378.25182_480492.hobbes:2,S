Hi Balbir,
Do you know why in the sched_info_arrive() and sched_info_depart()
functions the calculation of delta_jiffies does not use the time_after
or time_before macro to prevent  the miscalculation when jiffies
overflow?
For instance the delta_jiffies variable is simply calculated as:
delta_jiffies = now - t->sched_info.last_queued;
Do not you think the more logical way should be
if (time_after(now, t->sched_info.last_queued))
   delta_jiffies = now - t->sched_info.last_queued;
else
   delta_jiffies = (MAX_JIFFIES - t->sched_info.last_queued) + now
I have included more variables to measure some issues of schedule in
the kernel (following schedstat idea) and I noticed that jiffies
wraparound has led to wrong values, since the user space tool when
collecting the values is producing negative values.
Any comments?
Can I provide a patch for that?
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
