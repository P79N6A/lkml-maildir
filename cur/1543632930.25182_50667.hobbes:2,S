This is similar in theory to why we used to have the sync option on
wake_up for pipes... it does work.
We don't need a scheduler "hint" for this, though.  A big loud command
"bind me to this processor!" would do fine, and in 2.5 we have that:
just have one of the tasks do:
	sched_setaffinity(0, sizeof(unsigned long), 1);
	sched_setaffinity(other_guys_pid, sizeof(unsigned long), 1);
and both will be affined to CPU 1.
