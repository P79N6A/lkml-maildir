Hi Martijn.
 >> Is there any tool that gives the corresponding filename for every

Create /usr/local/bin/ilist with mode 755 and the following contents:
 Q> #!/bin/bash
 Q> if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
 Q>     echo "Usage: `basename $0` dir..."
 Q>     exit 255
 Q> fi
 Q> for DIR do
 Q>     echo "Directory: $DIR"
 Q>     ls -il `find $DIR`
 Q>     echo
 Q> done
 Q> exit 0
When you've done, run it, specifying the mount point of the relevant
file system as a parameter. It doesn't care what type of file system
you point it at, it'll still work...
 >> It should print out the inode number, the file name with entire
 >> path and tell the kind of inode it is. 
All of that and more is included in the output.
Best wishes from Riley.
