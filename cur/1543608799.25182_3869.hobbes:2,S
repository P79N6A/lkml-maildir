    Dear all:
	I've install a 3c985b-sx NIC on my linux 2.4.13 box.
	But when loading the 'acenic' module, it shows the message:
eth1: 3Com 3C985 Gigabit Ethernet at 0xdf020000, irq 10
  Tigon II (Rev. 6), Firmware: 12.4.11, MAC: 00:60:08:f7:04:1e
  PCI bus width: 32 bits, speed: 33MHz, latency: 64 clks
eth1: Firmware NOT running!
	(PS. My eth0 is an intel eepro100)
	It seems the driver detect the card but can't work.
	Is this a bug of my NIC firmware or a problem of
	the driver? Or what necessary steps I've missed?
	Thanks in advance.
	PS. Please CC your replis to me, thank you in advance.:)
