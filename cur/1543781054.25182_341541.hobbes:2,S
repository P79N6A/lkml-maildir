We've had it disabled in Fedora for a long time, maybe as far
back as FC2, for exactly this reason.  The only things that broke,
were things that needed fixing anyway. (Something like gdm was
reading /dev/mem to get a source of random numbers of all things).

We also restrict /dev/mem to be a 'need to know' basis. Trying
to read from certain regions of memory will fail.
Again, nothing that wasn't already broken broke with this change.

The above patches were in -mm for a while, though they didn't
have a config option, they just 'did it', and some of the
changes were a bit unclean, but I can polish that up if you're
interested.
