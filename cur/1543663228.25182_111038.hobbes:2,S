If you have simple needs that's fine. I build for multiple groups of
machines, and with a working mkinitrd I can just build a file for the boot
controller on each type of machine, and only build a single kernel which
will run anywhere with the proper initrd file.
using initrd files also allows easy control of the order in which SCSI
controllers are loaded, which prevents drives from changing names.
