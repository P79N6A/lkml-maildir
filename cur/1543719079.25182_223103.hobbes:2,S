Revision 1:
  dm-ioctl.c: Fix an OB1 error when calculating an output buffer size,
  that could cause a missing null termininator in the 'list devices'
  ioctl results.  [Steffan Paletta]
Revision 2:
  In __map_bio(), if the target returns an error while mapping the I/O, the
  cloned bio needs to be freed.
Revision 3:
  Replace dm_[add|remove]_wait_queue() with dm_wait_event().
  Some testing of DM multipath has turned up a problem with the DEVICE_WAIT
  command. In the tests, while performing a DEVICE_WAIT on a multipath device,
  the command sometimes returns immediately, even though the event-number is
  correct and no path-failure has occurred to trigger an event. The problem
  was tracked down to the call to schedule() in dev_wait(), which would return
  even though it was not woken up by a DM table event.
  This patch moves the responsibility for waiting from the ioctl interface
  into the core driver, and uses wait_event_interruptible() instead of relying
  on wait-queues and schedule().
Revision 4:
  DM: Add static and __init qualifiers. [Dave Olien]
Revision 5:
  dm-table.c: Proper usage of dm_vcalloc. [Dave Olien]
