They are being exported, otherwise miropcm20.o won't work, would it? I've
just been too lazy to change the Config.in properly. It is however mentioned
in the radio-miropcm20 helpfile.

appearently Robert Siemer's patch didn't make it to the actual kernel. He
did change the config.in and made some changes to aci.c to support his
version of the firmware. He'll probably be happy to maintain the driver
since I threw out the pmc20 card.
