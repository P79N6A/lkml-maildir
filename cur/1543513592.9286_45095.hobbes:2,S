If you mean lines like these in /proc/ksyms
c404c000 __insmod_vfat_O/lib/modules/2.3.19/fs/vfat.o_M37FC4F1F_V131859	[vfat]
c404c050 __insmod_vfat_S.text_L8062	[vfat]
c404dfe0 __insmod_vfat_S.rodata_L712	[vfat]
c404e400 __insmod_vfat_S.data_L336	[vfat]
Those are created by modutils 2.3 to help find modules in storage.
Without those lines, you only see the symbols that a module exports and
if a module exports no symbols then it is effectively invisible in
/proc/ksyms.  But you need modutils 2.3.1 or better to get the extra
__insmod lines, at a guess you have different versions of modutils on
each machine.
