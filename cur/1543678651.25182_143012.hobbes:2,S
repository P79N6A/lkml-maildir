Ok I'd be curious if it occurs there as well
The only bits the patch should touch are used in adjtimex, and adjtimex
is very limited on how much it can adjust time. If you're a year off or
whatever, its more likely ntpdate is calling stime/settimeofday. 
Could you boot w/o ntp starting up, then manually run  "ntpdate -b
<server>" to see if that causes it as well? 
thanks
