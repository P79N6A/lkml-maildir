Subject: Extra keys not working with 2.6

Please keep me CCd especially because I'm not on inux-input.
I'm emailing the USB list since this is a usb keyboard (wireless HP)
This keyboard has 8 extra keys on the top row.  Under 2.4, all the keys
worked fine.  Under 2.6 only 2 of those keys are recognised.
This is a partial dmesg when pressing the keys:
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 242
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 241
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 241
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 241
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 241
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 241
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 241
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 240
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 240
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 240
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 240
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 244
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 244
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 244
Under 2.4 and doing showkey -s I get these codes for the keys:
Key	Press	Release
1	46	c6
2	02	82
3	65	e5
4	6c	ec
5	45	c5
6	44	c4
7	4c	cc
8	4a	ca
(The keys aren't numbered)
How do I fix this so that it works again?  (I cannot test this on the PS/2
port.  the receiver doesn't support it)
