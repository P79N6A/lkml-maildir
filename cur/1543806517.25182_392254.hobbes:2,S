The driver seem not to initialize policy->cur in it's init function?
The 0 div probably comes from cpufreq_scale() called in time_cpufreq_notifier()
in kernel/arch/i386/timers/timer_tsc.c
This patch checks in update_policy() whether 0 is set as current freq:
(Be careful, Dave adjusted my original patch to mm, this one is on top of my
original one, so it might not patch cleanly on what Dave finally put in, but it should...)
Maybe it's easier if I submit the old one again with these lines added?
compile tested ...
