Hi Khelben,
It seems to be something related to tda8290/8275 tuner. This may be
standard related. Are those channels analog or digital? If analog,
what's your video standard?
Can you do a bissect and help us to identify what patch broke it?
You can do a -git bissect or use our Mercurial development tree,
available at:
	
http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb
At /README.patches file at the tree, you will find some basic rules on
how to do bissect.
Cheers,
Mauro.
