   Searching by subsystem vendor/device ID is not supported by the
generic code yet. I plan adding it soon, but in the meantime
you can use the following fragment:
	struct pci_dev *dev = NULL;
	while (dev = pci_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_PLXTECH, PCI_DEVICE_ID_9060SD, dev) {
		u32 sid;
		pci_read_config_dword(dev, PCI_SUBSYSTEM_VENDOR_ID, &sid);
		if (sid == 0x0640125c) {
			/* Device found */
		}
	}
				Have a nice fortnight
