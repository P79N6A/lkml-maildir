My guess would be that 'mtime' should be always updated because the
directory contents is changed (a new name is added). And 'ctime' has to
change whenever this new name cause a change in the size of the
directory because the i_size attribute has changed.
As tmpfs doesn't really have on-disk blocks for it's directories, every
create will change the directory size. (as well as every unlink).
