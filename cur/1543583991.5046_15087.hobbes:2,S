Ugh !
I had a nasty feeling that might be what they were up to. The reason for
the "ugh" is as follows. If you're a UP system, it never makes sense to
spin in userland, since you'll just burn up a timeslice and prevent the
lock holder from running. I haven't looked, but assume that their code only
uses spinlocks on SMP. If you're an SMP system, then you shouldn't be
using a spinlock unless the critical section is "short", in which case the 
waiters should simply spin in userland rather than making system calls which
is simply overhead. If the argument is that the "spinners" take too much
useful time away from other processes, then it sounds like the contention is
too high, or that the critical section is sufficiently long that semaphores
would be a better choice.
Actually, what's really needed here is an efficient form of dynamically
marking a process as non-preemptible so that when acquiring a spinlock the
process can ensure that it exits the critical section as fast as possible,
when it would relinquish its non-preemptible privilege.
Another synchronization method popular with database peeps is "post/wait"
for which SGI have a patch available for Linux. I understand that this is
relatively "light weight" and might be a better choice for PG.
