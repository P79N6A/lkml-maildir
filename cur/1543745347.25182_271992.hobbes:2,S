How about adding a new field to the entry for each person in the CREDITS
file?
Something like this perhaps :
--- linux-2.6.10-rc2-orig/CREDITS	2004-11-17 01:18:58.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.6.10-rc2/CREDITS	2004-11-17 22:04:00.000000000 +0100

That doesn't account for everyone who has ever contributed code, but it 
does cover quite a few people if we can get anyone who's in there to add a 
similar line and encourage people who are not represented in CREDITS to 
submit an entry.
Of course there will still be some people it is impossible to reach (some 
dead, some just non-communicative) - some of those missing people may have 
left appropriate licensing info in source file comments, list emails or 
similar, so maybe that info could be used for their entry. For everyone 
else who either do not want to be listed in CREDITS or who are "missing" 
and have not left any clues as to their licensing preferences, well, I 
guess the COPYING file would then apply to them - or?
