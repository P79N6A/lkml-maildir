Use the source, Luke.
The source is online at 
http://www.wassenaar.org/
 and exempts a fairly  
large class of software, including just about anything that can be  
downloaded from somewhere. (In the Lists/General Notes part: "public  
domain" in Wassenaar essentially means "free".)
Don't you just love it when people spread unfounded rumours?
