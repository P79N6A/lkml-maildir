Most likely. AC is hardly any good inside a computer :)

A crystal will drive the frequency, which can be set with outb(0x42).
Whether the crystal's oscillating signal is connected to the speaker
can be controlled with outb(0x61) IIRC [or just see
drivers/input/misc/pcspkr.c].

Since you can set the x86's crystals frequency from 1193182 to 18 Hz
(PIT_TICK_RATE / 1 to PIT_TICK_RATE / 65535) [*], you can never really
bust it. But even then, what would a speaker do it was constanly given
+5V? (I _suppose_ the other level is 0V, not -5V -- makes for easy 
design.) That's IMO just like a sound file with volume(x) = 1, nothing 
spectacular if you ask me.
[*] The line "if (value > 20 && value < 32767) in pcspkr.c looks a bit bogus.
