You tested x86 but broke more than half a dozen other archtectures, 
with at least 3 different commits breaking other architectures.
It now takes a few days until this mess is completely sorted out, and I 
hope there won't be too many poor souls having to bisect 2.6.25-rc1 
regresions on !x86 since this can now become the pure horror.
And if people give up trying to bisect 2.6.25 might ship with more 
regressions.
I already said in the past that the x86 tree contains not architecture 
specific stuff that doesn't belong there, and looking at the following 
parts of the diffstat, most of it does simply not belong into an
"x86 arch update":
