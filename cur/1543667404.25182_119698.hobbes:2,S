Subject: some new phenomena with IO-APIC and ACPI on via kt333/vt8235

I'd like to report some experiences with an epox 8k5a3+ mobo and
linux-2.5.65-ac3. (my problems should also apply to previous 2.5 and 2.4
kernels)
I've always had trouble, when I used IO-APIC with this board. ACPI never
did work, cause every 2.5 kernel I tried, did not boot past the ide
setup (XT-PIC + ACPI). IO-APIC + ACPI did boot, but ACPI didn't work -
at least it wouldn't shut down properly. Now I found a way to boot
2.5.65-ac3 with ACPI enabled in XT-PIC mode: I disabled both HPT 374 IDE
Controllers. ACPI then could do proper shutdown.
But a new problem occured: My RTL 8139 NIC did not work anymore ( it has
always worked fine in both XT and IO APIC setups). Then I tried to boot
again with IO-APIC mode (HPT-374 still disabled) and the 8139 worked
fine again. Hmmm ?? 
Any other suggestions than throwing my mobo to trash?
thx
Christian
