Subject: question re usage of  interruptible_sleep_on( ) function call  in  cpm_iic_tryaddress( ) function (in i2c-algo-8xx.c)

Yes, it is embedded, yes it is not INTEL arch ... but PLEASE - READ ON ! ;-)
> 
> Currently booting of the board hangs in the I2C driver after invocation of
> interruptible_sleep_on( )
>  function call  in cpm_iic_tryaddress( ) function (in i2c-algo-8xx.c
> file).

> Is it appropriate to use the interruptible_sleep_on( ) function at the
> kernel booting stage ?
>  (I personally do not think so - since such usage prevents further kernel
> booting - as observed).
> What should be done in this code to avoid sleeping  forever - how to put
> time out on this sleep ?

> Follow up question:  is it really expected to do I2C initialization ONLY
> as a module after the kernel booting ?
