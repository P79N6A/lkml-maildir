works -- sort of:(   I've tried both test9 and test10 with your patch
on a PPro200 with 128MB ram and I get the same effects both times:
directory listing seems to be possible (haven't checked data contents yet)
BUT if I try "du /cdrom/"  (either using real cdrom device or loopback mount
of my sample isofs image) there seems to be a huge memory leak !
first observation is that "du" is awfuly slow -- it takes ~90 secs real time
and ~60 system cpu secs to "du" through the first ~70 of 106 direcories, 
then the 128MB memory are almost used up and the systems starts to
swap heavily.  this meory doesn't get freed up even after umount/losetup -d
or whatever -- only reboot "helps"...
I'll attach log files showing output of "free", /proc/meminfo and
output of ALT-SYSREQ-M plus full "ps" output  for both -test9 and 
-test10 with your patch  in the situation when almost all memory 
is "gone" (du already killed).  hope this helps...
