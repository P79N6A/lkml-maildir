I am reposting yesterday's Version 5 patch set because I know that
it didn't get everywhere it was supposed to.
I have broken the Smack patch into the netlabel changes from Paul Moore
(1/2) and the Smack LSM (2/2), at Paul's kind suggestion.
The smackfs symlinks have proven too contentious. I have removed the
facility. Al and Alan are correct that the rich set of mount options
currently available can handle any of the use cases I was looking at
without excessive difficulty.
I think that is the last of the major issues. I'm sure that if there
are more y'all will let me know.
Thank you.
