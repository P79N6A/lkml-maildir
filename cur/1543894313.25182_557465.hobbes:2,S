Why do we have to replay all of this?
You: conceptully-new add-on which benefits 0.25% of the user base, provided
they select the right config options and filesystem.
Me: simpler enhancement which benefits 100% of the user base (ie: includes
4k blocksize, 4k pagesize) and which also fixes your performance problem
with that HBA.
We want the 100% case.
