Yes since we ioremap both regions in ibmtr_cs.c and pass the cookies into 
ibmtr.c we should be using read*/write*. With the simple fix to do this
and use the non byteswapping versions of read*/write* the token ring
pcmcia driver works fine on a titanium powerbook.
My suggestion is to throw this into ibmtr.h:
#ifdef PCMCIA
#define tr_readb(addr)		readb(addr)
#define tr_readw(addr)		__raw_readw(addr)
#define tr_readl(addr)		__raw_readl(addr)
#define tr_writeb(val, addr)	writeb(val, addr)
#define tr_writel(val, addr)	__raw_writel(val, addr)
#define tr_writew(val, addr)	__raw_writew(val, addr)
#else
#define tr_readb(addr)		isa_readb(addr)
#define tr_readw(addr)		isa_readw(addr)
#define tr_readl(addr)		isa_readl(addr)
#define tr_writeb(val, addr)	isa_writeb(val, addr)
#define tr_writel(val, addr)	isa_writel(val, addr)
#define tr_writew(val, addr)	isa_writew(val, addr)
#endif
