"If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation."

From my understanding, this implicitely says that if the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and no 
"any later version", the version is fixed.
