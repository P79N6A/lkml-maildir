No, it's not truly random. That would be insane. And, no, if you don't change
the kernel or the hardware, then they won't jump around.
But, yes, if you change the hardware, or someone changes the probe order
in the kernel, you can suffer from device name slippage. This is a minor
problem on a small home system, and a massive PITA on a large server.
You can at least mandate the probe order on a 2.4 system (see the scsihosts
parameter).
