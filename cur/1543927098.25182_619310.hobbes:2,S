I would prefer a general document that has a target specific
section.
Something like Documentation/make/headers_install and your text merged.
And the resuting file could be named kernel-build-howto.txt (or similar)
and located in Documentation/kbuild/
On top of this we should enhance the arch specific help for x86
to tell how to select bit-size. But I have left that until we unify
the 32 and 64 bit Makefiles.
I have yet to read your document - too late for that now..
