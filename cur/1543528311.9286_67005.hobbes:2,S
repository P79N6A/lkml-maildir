I once tunneled IPX thru a ssh connection. The
idea was to start a ppp daemon on both sides and
pass the IPX thru the ppp connection.
Maybe now there is something better possible, I don't
know. But if you're interested in my hack solution, I can
send you the scripts which fire the connection up....
