What makes you think /dev/sda is the raid?  For me cat /proc/scsi/scsi
lists all 4 drives which, to me, implies that it is raw.
fdisk could not partition the raid by default.  I needed to use sfdisk the
first time.  After that fdisk worked fine.
If I have both modules loaded I can mount /dev/i2o/hd/dics0/part1 but not
/dev/sda1 (no filesystem).
I was hoping i2o_scsi would make it appear as a "normal" scsi device, but
I don't think that is happening with the current driver.
If you are having a different scsi setup I would be interested in trying
to set my system up the same way.  Thanks!
