Yeah, RCU documentation needs some serious updating :(
One other thing, it might be better to do all handler checks
in request_nmi and release_nmi in the spinlock serialized
critical section to minimize memory barrier issues unlike in the code
snippet I mailed - things like the list_empty() check etc.
That way you need to look at memory barrier issues with only
one piece of lockfree code - call_nmi_handlers.
Thanks
