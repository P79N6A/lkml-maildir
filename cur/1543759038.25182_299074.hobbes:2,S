Out of the blue came a screen freeze. Opera browser froze, window
manager froze (not X or mouse) but gkrellm system monitor was alive and
showing no irregular activity. The freeze lasted less than a minute.
It resembled nothing I've ever seen before. Kernel log has the following
entry:
Mar  3 18:03:01 loke kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
Mar  3 18:03:11 loke kernel: hda: DMA timeout error
Mar  3 18:03:11 loke kernel: hda: dma timeout error: status=0x58 
{ DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Mar  3 18:03:11 loke kernel:
Mar  3 18:03:11 loke kernel: ide: failed opcode was: unknown
My drives have thir SMART regularly checked by
smartmontools(.sourceforge.net) and doing a manual run right after this
freeze showed everything to be OK.
Mvh
