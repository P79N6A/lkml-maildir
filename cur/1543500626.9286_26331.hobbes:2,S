Oh, futz.  There's a very good reason, which has already been stated: the
same reason that "ls -l" of a database-type file (whether from Berkeley DB or
Oracle) doesn't return the number of bytes occupied by active records.
Reorganizing a database-like file (and directories are in effect simple
databases) on the fly is fraught with race conditions and performance
issues.  So when you delete a "record" you leave the space there, allocated
but unused.  If a later new record will fit in the space, you reuse it.  This 
is true of directories; it's true of gdbm; it's true of Berkeley DB; it's
true of Oracle and Informix.  And not just on Linux.
Can we lay this silly thread to rest now?

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
