I tried this. I already reported that X came up on the radeon.
I could not run X on the G550, now that it was "secondary",
but the crash was different from the radeon crash.
The logs with secondary radeon used to end like this:
(II) LoadModule: "int10"
(II) Reloading /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/linux/libint10.a
(II) RADEON(0): initializing int10
(**) RADEON(0): Option "InitPrimary" "on"
(II) Truncating PCI BIOS Length to 53248
The logs for secondary G550 ends like this, with or without int10

The video bios is apparently not detected at all, and therefore not run.
The kernel doesn't actually hang, only X gets stuck.  sysrq+T
dumped stack traces for all tasks except the xserver.  For X,
there was only one line identifying the xserver process and the fact
that it was Running.  No stack dump.  I managed to kill all tasks
and have init proceeding into init 2.  
So I wonder - is Debians X 4.3.0.1 buggy, or the kernel?
The fact remains that the newer kernels locks up while trying to use the
secondary radeon, while it actually works with 2.6.8.1.
Well, actually 2.6.8.1 is a bit unstable once 3D stuff starts on the
radeon - but it is only the radeon xserver that locks up in an
infinite loop after a while. Other processes remain responsive.
