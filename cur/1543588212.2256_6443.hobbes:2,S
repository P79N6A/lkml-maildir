Hi,
Just to keep people informed (hi Miles!) that since the announcement of
the linux-security-module mailing list, some actual work has come out of
it.  Actual working code has been posted, which shows the current state,
and the general model of what people are working toward.  This post and
the patch can be found at:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-module&m=98764307916530&w=2
Comments on this are welcomed on either this list, or on the
linux-security-module list.
thanks,
greg k-h
