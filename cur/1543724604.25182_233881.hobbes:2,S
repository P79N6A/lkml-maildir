No. Make it a CONFIG_DEFAULT_NOEXEC and make the relevant architectures do
a
	define_bool DEFAULT_NOEXEC y
in their Kconfig files.
In general, we should _never_ use an architecture-define. They just always
end up becoming more and more hairy, and less and less obvious what they 
are all about.
So instead, make a readable and explicit config define, and let each 
architecture just set it (or not) as they wish.
