Matt's patch just went into Linus' tree, so I'll comment on this.
More importantly, the modules now contain suitable aliases embedded within
them: modules.pcimap et al will vanish before 2.6 whenever Greg (hint hint)
updates the hotplug scripts to use them instead of modules.XXXmap.
So the question is, how do you add PCI IDs to a module which isn't loaded?
You can trivially add a new alias for it, which will cause modprobe to
find it, but the module won't know it can handle the new PCI ID, and
will fail to load.
Obvious options include:
	just update the damn module
	inserting the new PCI entry in the module (simple, but icky)
	adding a module param to say "add these IDs"
I agree with Alan (and Jeff Garzik who pointed this out to me before)
that it's neat to be able to update these tables on the fly, but that
is probably even more important for modules which aren't loaded.
Matt, do you have thoughts on this?
Cheers,
Rusty.
