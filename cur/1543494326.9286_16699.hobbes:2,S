Thanks for the testing. Anyway had a report about panic on shutdown also
on 2.2.7_andrea2.bz2 (some more information about the panic would be very
useful though ;). Now I had also new ideas to implement. Maybe the new
patches will be better...
(ah and 2.2.6andrea4 had a bug in swapoff so make sure to unmount your
filesystem before swapoff -a!!. To unmount your fs you can simply do
killall5 and then umount /, then swapoff -a and reboot. You should
workaround the bug this way. If you never swapoff -a according to me it
should work fine also 2.2.6andrea4, and it seems that it's working fine ;)
