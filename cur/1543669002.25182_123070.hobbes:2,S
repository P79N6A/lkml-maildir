Hello,
I hope it is the right place to ask about my problem...
I want to use /dev/lp0 (lp module) on my PC for controlling
external devices.
The problem is when I wtire 1 byte to /dev/lp0, paralel port
keeps this state just for few ms...
(I made special plug - so the is no problem with handshake - details on:

)
It is strange because everything works corect on my old PC (Pentium160).
Regards,
Filip
