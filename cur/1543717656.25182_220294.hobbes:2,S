Well, I guess you are right, but I prefer (and usually do) a single source tree in /usr/src/linux-2.6.6 as for the kurrent kernel and then other users (i.e. non root) compile with the KBUILD_OUTPUT in other directories.
Why?
Because I compile all my kernels on a single machine (but with distcc running on 4+ boxes) and then install it on the other machines.
Even if these file permissions are note a "real bug" there is no point in only some files being non-world readable (some in the Documentation/ as well).
