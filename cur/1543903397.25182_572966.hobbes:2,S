Subject: [PATCH] CONFIG_NET=n - lots of link time errors

Hi,
enable everything from Drivers > Networking, but deselect CONFIG_NET. 
This throws a ton of linking errors (when using CONFIG_MODULES=n), and 
probably unresolved symbols (MODULES=m). Happens in current -git, but I 
believe it dates much farther back, because this is imo just a simple 
Kconfig issue. I think we need to hand out a big 'if NET'-endif block in 
drivers/net/Kconfig. The full error log is like 120 K in size, and I 
doubt it would make sense to post it, given instructions above. I'll 
attach my (i386) .config for anyone to see it for themselves, and a 
patch proposal right below. Is it ok to add 'depends on NET' on 
NETDEVICES, or are there some network devices that can live without 
CONFIG_NET?
Thanks,
	Jan

Enabling drivers from "Devices > Networking" (in menuconfig), for 
example SLIP and/or PLIP, throws link time errors when CONFIG_NET itself 
is =n. Have CONFIG_NETDEVICES depend on CONFIG_NET.
