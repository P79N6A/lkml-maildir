__builtin_classify_type () doesn't give types unique ID, it only classifies
them:
/* Values returned by __builtin_classify_type.  */
enum type_class
{
  no_type_class = -1,
  void_type_class, integer_type_class, char_type_class,
  enumeral_type_class, boolean_type_class,
  pointer_type_class, reference_type_class, offset_type_class,
  real_type_class, complex_type_class,
  function_type_class, method_type_class,
  record_type_class, union_type_class,
  array_type_class, string_type_class,
  lang_type_class
};
All structures are given record_type_class, all unions union_type_class,
all pointers pointer_type_class, etc.
That doesn't mean you can't use it in the kernel as additional source
of type checking (in addition to e.g. sizeof and __alignof__).
