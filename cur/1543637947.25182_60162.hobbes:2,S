level is in a register (rdi), but pt_regs is on the stack. The calling 
convention automatically switches to stack location for structures bigger 
than one register.  
On i386 it is probably cleanest when you need both pt_regs and arguments
to declare pt_regs only and get the first argument directly out of regs->ebx.
