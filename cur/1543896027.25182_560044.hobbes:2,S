I don't agree with this (+ I know it doesn't matter).
The real bug is what Chuck Ebbert wrote: "Spinlocks aren't fair".
And here they are simply lawlessly not fair.
I cannot see any reason why any of tasks doing simultaneously
"busy-loop on getting/releasing" a spinlock should starve almost
to death another one doing the same (or simply waiting to get this
lock) even without cpu_relax. Of course, lawfulness of such
behavior is questionable, and should be fixed like here.

On the other hand it seems spinlocks should be at least a little
more immune to such bugs: slowdown is OK but not freezing. Current
behavior could suggest this unfairness could harm some tasks even
without any loops present - but it's not visible enough.
So, I'm surprised this thread seems to stop after this patch, and
there is no try to make the most of this ideal testing case to
improve spinlock design btw.
