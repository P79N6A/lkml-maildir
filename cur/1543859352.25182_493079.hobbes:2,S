I mentioned that to Linus once and he said the entire
idea was bogus.
With the recent tcp_recvmsg() preemption issue thread,
I agree with his sentiments even more than I did previously.
What needs to happen is to liberate the locking so that
input packet processing can occur in parallel with
tcp_recvmsg(), instead of doing this bogus backlog thing
which can wedge TCP ACK processing for an entire quantum
if we take a kernel preemption while the process has the
socket lock held.
