While true, I know of no utilities that will frame a scsi command to eject a
disk -- it wouldn't work with IDE devices (I said _I_D_E_ not _A_T_A_P_I_)
or propriatary interfaces.  (The only thing I know about is my own creation
and it does work with SCSI and ATAPI devices.)

Actually, the stock eject uses a standard ioctl() to eject media.  The kernel
maintains a use count and will not eject anything it thinks is still in use.
