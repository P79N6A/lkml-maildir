I really doubt that XFree86 has any intentions of moving to /dev/fb at
all. It may be supported as a "chipset" but that is all. 
Moving to /dev/fb would most likely decrease portability, not increase
it. XFree86 is not Linux specific software.

That's because scanners are usually dodgy wrt SCSI.

SCSI generic, SCSI cdrom, which one you choose to use is irrelevant to
my argument. You are nibbling at the edges of my original point.

Cough. Feel free to write one. I'll applaud if you manage to write one
that doesn't suck.
