It's the result of me deciding CONFIG_XIP_ROM wasn't totally appropriate ...

... so I renamed it to CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL.  Especially since there is also 
XIPable user space which also can be stored in ROM (or flash).  So please 
disregard CONFIG_XIP_ROM and use CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL.  Whether ROM or Flash is 
used is rather irrelevant to the code this option is linked to.
