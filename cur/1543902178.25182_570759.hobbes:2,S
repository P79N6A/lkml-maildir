Well, as far as I'm concerned, you could also make all drivers that 
actually need "check_signature()" do a Kconfig level
	select CHECK_SIGNATURE
along with a
	config CHECK_SIGNATURE
		bool
		default n
in lib/Kconfig, and thus make it totally independent of any hw/bus 
features at all, and simply depend on whether it is needed or not. I'd be 
ok with that, and it's certainly "correct" too.
Hmm?
