My "distribution" can't because I don't use a bootloader at install time.
Install versions of the kernel I use may well not have the

This is *much* simpler than using a bootloader. Are bootloaders
multi-lingual? (Does lilo do Dvorak? I've been typing "local" in
cross-keymapping lately.) This is very trivial code. The capabilities it
adds to user-space are tremendous compared to the cost. For those who
equate complexity to validity, or sophistication, this allows an
install-time script to select a file hierarchy language. Some prefer unix.
I prefer English. You might prefer Multics or AmigaDos. This is the
simplest way to offer a choice. I don't think you're opposed to the code,
though. Surely not. I think you're opposed to the choice.
I have...

Where's the /sbin equivalent?  /.sbi is a symlink to /command/background.
More simplicity; this is the converter to convert almost anything to this
dotted namespace.
