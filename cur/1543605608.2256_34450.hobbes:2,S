Because the majority of people (and especially those who haven't been reached 
by Linux yet) don't care for the messages. They are as interested in boot 
messages as you may be in reading debug information from your DVD player or 
car. 
Assuming you have a car with a display for the embedded computer, and you 
don't know anything about its software or hardware, you just want to drive. 
Would you prefer to see lots of cryptic messages when you turn the key, or 
just some simple picture with a progress bar showing you when the system is 
ready?
IMHO the bar is all you need. Everything else just distracts you from the 
only important thing. 
Showing unimportant information is like turning on debug messages that you 
don't need.
