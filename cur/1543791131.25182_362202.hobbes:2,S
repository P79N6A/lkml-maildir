Right the problem irqpoll addresses is irqs that get stuck on.
The kernel will disable them at the interrupt controller and
we need a way to continue.  Mostly that only happens if the
irq is shared with something else, that we don't load a driver for,
or if an irq comes in before the driver initializes.

Right and the result is a more robust kernel in general.  In most
cases the failure mode is a second kernel that doesn't boot,
or it doesn't successfully initialize the drivers.  Which is
a much better failure than potentially scribbling random
data all over you disk, which is what using drivers in a broken
kernel can do.

Given that part of all possible status is broken hardware,
that isn't necessarily possible. Still attempting to recover
from all possible status is a sound plan.

Not to my knowledge.  The big push until just lately has simply
been to get the core working.  Vivek Goyal would be the most
likely suspect. But feel free to work on pathological scenarios.
I'm still not quite convinced that crashdumps are interesting yet :)
