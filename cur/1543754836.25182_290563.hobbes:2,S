You probably should. The patch you've tested is really ugly, and not a fix 
at all - it's really just depending on the compiler generating a specific 
code sequence that will hide the race.  As such, it's a patch I would only 
accept in the standard kernel as an absolute last resort.
In contrast, the second patch I tested may actually _fix_ the race. 
The fact that the first patch makes the oops go away is a good thing, 
though: it shows that your oops really was due to that small race window, 
and as such it helps validate that it wasn't anything else.
Thanks,
