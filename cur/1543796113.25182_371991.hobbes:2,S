I've increased it to 4 seconds, no change. It looks like the response
(or request) is lost somewhere.
The answer is always the same second:
Dec  1 15:20:32 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status entered
Dec  1 15:20:32 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status: line state 20
Dec  1 15:20:37 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status entered
Dec  1 15:20:37 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status: line state 20
Dec  1 15:20:42 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status entered
Dec  1 15:20:42 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status: line state 20
... or it doesn't come at all:
Dec  1 15:20:47 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_check_status entered
Dec  1 15:20:51 defiant kernel: usb 1-1: events/0 timed out on ep0in len=0/4
Dec  1 15:20:51 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: speedtch_read_status: MSG D failed
Dec  1 15:20:51 defiant kernel: ATM dev 0: error -110 fetching device status
Do the speedtouches have some means (firmware) for debugging or logging?
We would need to see what does the ADSL receive and what does it think
about it.
