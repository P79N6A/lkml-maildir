I suggest turning off disconnect as a start. Adaptec and BusLogic
controllers have a BIOS menu. If this temporarily fixes the problem,
you probably have a drive that negotiates for a sync speed that it can't
possibly handle. Setting (forcing) the sync speed to be less than what it
negotiated will usually fix this problem.
