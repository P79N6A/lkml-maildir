This only matters if your benchmark is dependent on round-trip latency
(no read-ahead or write behind and no command overlap) or if you have
saturated the bus.  None of these are the case with the single drive
I/O benchmarks that have been talked about in this thread.  I suppose
I should have been more specific in saying, "the command overhead is
not a factor in the issues raised by this thread".  Now if you want
to use command overhead as a reason to use tagged queuing to mitigate
that overhead, by all means, go right ahead.

Okay.

I've seen evidence that a series of reads takes a long time to complete,
but nothing that indicates that every read is starved beyond what you
would expect to see if a huge number of writes were issued between each
read.

Actually I haven't.  The closest I can come to this is a single read way
off on the far side of the disk starved by a continuous stream or reads
on the other side of the platter.  This behavior was fixed by all major
drive manufacturers that I know of back in 97 or 98.

Which unfortunately characterizes only a single symptom without breaking
it down on a transaction by transaction basis.  We need to understand
how many writes were queued by the OS to the drive between each read to
know if the drive is actually allowing writes to pass reads or not.
