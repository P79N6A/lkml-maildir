After upgrading my systme to 2.6.7-bk19 (which does have Jeff Garzik's
recent fixes, right?), I am still seeing
-----------------------------------
ata1: command 0x25 timeout, stat 0x58 host_stat 0x1
scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 00 c7 4d 67 00 00 08 00

and once a string of reiserfs errors (refuted subsequently by reiserfs, which found the system clean).
Some of my PCI devices:

And my hard drive is a ST3160023AS.
