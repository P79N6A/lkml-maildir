A while ago I configured a few squid boxes which ran off of a read-only
system. Mke2fs is actually unacceptably slow on large file systems, faster
then fsck, but still time consuming. I found that zeroing out the disk, then
formating it and saving the non-zero blocks, replaying them on reboot to be
an acceptable solution.
