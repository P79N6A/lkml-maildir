judging by the look of the drives, quantum was bought by maxtor (i think
they really did); they look nearly identical. but i'll try to connect them
to different channels and use a new cable. and the cdrom is a scsi drive...

for me, it looks like this:
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
Unknown bridge resource 0: assuming transparent
PCI: Using IRQ router VIA [1106/0686] at 00:07.0
PCI: Disabling Via external APIC routing

nothing about athlons (i have a duron, though this shouldn't make a
difference)...

yeah, i know... and that's what makes this so difficult to track down...
it doesn't seem to be a hardware problem. i copied about 15gb from the old
to the new drive (with linux, on fat32 partitions). i diff'ed them, just to
be sure, and not a single file was corrupted... the only corruption i found
was on reiserfs partitions (though my ext2 partition is only 50mb). i ran
the maxtor power diagnostics, including a 6 hour burn in test, and it said
the drive works perfectly... i'm really out of ideas here...
