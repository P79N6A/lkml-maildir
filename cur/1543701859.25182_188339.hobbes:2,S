Well, no luck here. When clock=pmtmr is appended, the system hangs just
after printing:
#v+
Warning: clock= override failed. Defaulting to PIT
Using pit for high-res timesource
Detected 1700.598 MHz processor.
Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
#v-
The system boots fine without the clock= parameter, though.
[it's an ASUS L3800C laptop with a P4-M and 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 with your patch
