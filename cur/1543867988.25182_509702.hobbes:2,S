This doesn't make any sense as a driver macro, because it's per device, 
not per driver. E.g., the sdhci driver drives a number of devices, 
including both well-documented devices and devices whose only 
documentation is that the PCI ID matches (and they work with only a few 
quirks).
On the other hand, a kconfig-readable table of PCI, USB, etc IDs with this 
information isn't a bad idea, especially if the drivers actually depend on 
it (so that it has to be kept up to date, at least as far as the 
device/driver mapping).
