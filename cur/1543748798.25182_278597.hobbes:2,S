So your problem was only temporary?
Or?
After I began having the problem, I was trying to edit some files and
then I got the same errors as you, ie: /usr/bin/vi Input/Ouput error,
and then I tried to run or edit different programs and files and nothing
was working.  
Were you also forced to re-install, or does this only happen sometimes?

I've not tried to reproduce it on a non-gentoo kernel as the original
one that i had the problem was a vanilla kernel ;) ( as i know your
fondness of gentoo's patch-o-lotic )
I've been abusing the box the entire day with FreeBSD, the same mysql
config and version of the mysqld as well as the same operations ( and
some more ... serious ones ( e.g. forkbomb, iozone, etc. ) and no
problem's.
There were no messages in the log, and nothing in kmesg. Anything else
i could try ? Also, as far as i know i was running kernel 2.6.10_rc3
and i'd reinstalled the box twice with new XFS filesystems both times.
