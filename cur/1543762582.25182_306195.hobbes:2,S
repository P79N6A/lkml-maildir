Hi
Just to answer some questions :
- USB works ok since 2.6.11
- audio works too. The only problem is that two applications can't
open /dev/dsp in the same time.
- network works
I own an Asus A8N-Sli motherboard with the Nforce4-Sli chipset, and I
experiment the following problem :
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x60
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: DMA timeout retry
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: timeout waiting for DMA
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: status error: status=0x58 {
DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: 
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: ide: failed opcode was: unknown
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: 
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: ide: failed opcode was: unknown
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hdb: DMA disabled
Mar 25 22:42:55 evenflow kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Of course, if I disable DMA with hdparm, this problem disappear.. but
it isn't a long-term solution ;-)
Using vanilla 2.6.11.5 kernel. I attached the config file.
I also experiment sometimes a complete hang of the system. But I
didn't find how to reproduce the bug yet, especially because it seems
to happen when I do nothing (when I'm sleeping or am at work ;), and I
can't get a Oops because I don't have any serial console...
Kind regards,
