Yep, I know, I just 'clarified' it in case somebody was wondering.

Yep, did that.  I had a simple c program once that tried to
simulate all file operations on that file, and the 'real'
man page that gets installed.  Did not have the same effect
however.  Might be that I was off by something.  Don't have
it however anymore, as it was some months before, just before
I mailed the first time.
