What about LVM?
We'll see what we can do to test the scsi-code. Please send it to us
when you have code. I guess there are fixes for both generic-scsi code
and for each controller, right? What controllers are you planning on
fixing first?
What tests do you recommend?
mkfs on a big device, and then putting >2TB data on it?
