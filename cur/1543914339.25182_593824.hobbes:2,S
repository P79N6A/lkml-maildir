Missing from the list:
USB "autosuspend" feature (new in 2.6.23) breaks *lots* of devices.
Many have since been blacklisted in one-at-a-time discovery patches,
but that's really just the tip of the iceberg.
This "feature" breaks a TON of user-visible things,
mostly USB storage devices (USB drives/pens, digicams, etc..).
The functionality is broken for just too much stuff,
and needs to either be reverted or defaulted to "off" rather than "on".
Cheers
