Out of all the old 72 pin simms we have, we have it maxed out at 48 MB's.  I'm
tempted to take the 2 drives out and put them in the k6-2, but that's too much
of a hassle.  I'm currently going to try 2.4.1-ac19 and see what happens.
The machine does have 128MB of swap space working, and whenever I've checked
memory usage (while the system was still responding), it never went over a
couple megs of swap space used.
