I'm sorry, it's not clear to me what you're asking here.
The bootloaders will load bzImage at the 1 MB point, and it's up to the 
decompressor to locate it appropriately.  It has (correctly) been 
pointed out that it would be faster if the decompressed kernel is 
located to the 4 MB point -- large pages don't work below 2/4 MB due to 
interference with the fixed MTRRs -- but that's doesn't affect the boot 
protocol in any way.
I was under the impression that your relocatable patches allows the boot 
loader to load the bzImage at a different address than the usual 
0x100000; but again, that shouldn't affect the kernel's final resting place.
