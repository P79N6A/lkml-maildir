I have 2 boxes running RHEL ES at work, and I installed it on my laptop (a 
cheap Advert thing).  The soundcard didn't work, and USB went wonky.
So I tried to build a new kernel, and that was it, almost every module broke.  
I messed about for ages, but never got it right.
I fixed it by installing Slackware 10 instead...
I am sure with RHEL there is an extra step somewhere to build a kernel 
properly.
