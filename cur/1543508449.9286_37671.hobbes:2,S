I seem to have narrowed down my problems with my HP Laserjet 4+
significantly. It appears that enabling the duplex option on the printer
(menu - printing menu - duplex = on) has an adverse effect on the
ability of the printer to process form feeds. I would assume the printer
must be stripping these in some fashion to enable the duplex feature.
Either way, after disabling this feature, things seem better!
Has anyone else seen this? Has anyone found a workaround? Is anyone
interested in fixing it?
Thanks!
