yes - that crash was a showstopper that was holding up the pull request 
for 2 days. Paul bisected it down to the culprit and the fix was to do 
this in wake_up_new_task():
-       if (!p->sched_class->task_new || !current->se.on_rq) {
+       if (!p->sched_class->task_new || !current->se.on_rq || !rq->cfs.curr) {
(during early bootup the cfs_rq has no curr pointer yet.) It's not clear 
why this race did not trigger earlier. (and the two checks can probably 
be consolidated into a single "!rq->cfs.curr" condition.)
