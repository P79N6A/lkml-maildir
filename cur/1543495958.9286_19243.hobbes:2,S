Hi!
I'm trying to develop driver for network card. As I've only one
computer (but two cards ;-) available, I'd like trafic for localhost
to go through external link.
I know this has been here before. Alan's response was that it is only
good for testing. There was even patch around. Does anyone remember
what needs to be patched?

PS: Alan, I still think that (according to principle of least
surprise) we should route packets to localhost using external network
if user attempts to do that. It is really usefull for testing...
