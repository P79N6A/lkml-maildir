  Well from the attacker's point of view I believe it does. For many reasons

  block (per ip-blocking firewall basis) and, if there is a chance for the
  linux ipv4 code of handling some kind of floods per host basis (eg buffering
  "bad" hostips for some time for doing some special communication with those),
  then it is even worse. Btw the same can happen with userspace code doing
  buffering.
:Define netdead exactly. The machine is very unresponsive to any local input,
:correct ?
  During the attack and while the machine is replying RST's, seems like the
  NIC cannot get a chance to send a single packet to machines connected to
  the same switch. If, I disable replying of RST's (with ipfw - that is
  allow only incoming and outgoing packets at specific ports), even when during
  the attack is going on, the linux machine can happily communicate with others.

:better because it is a bigger problem on gigabit ethernet]

:I think your analysis of that the replied RSTs are the main problem is not
:quite correct. 
  During the attack the linux does not have any special load and internaly,
  processes and everything are doing great (either when replying RSTs or when
  I have disabled them). But if it is replying RSTs, I can only sit at the
  console and see it is doing great because it is unreachable (meaning it takes
  about 15 minutes to get an established an ssh connection to it) from everywhere
  else. In other words, apart from its network connectivity, all else is
  doing great.
:I don't know why you're blocking non ACK packets, it does not make much sense.
  If you live in an ideal networld, it doesn't. I don't.
:It seems your firewall can take packet floods better than your IRC server.
:Not suprising.
  Actually it is not a masquerading firewall. It is only an ip-blocking
  firewall. It does not take any flood. It justs forwards packets as it's
  been told to and that includes all incoming TCP packets with ACK bit set at
  defined port ranges.
:It'll probably help against clueless script kiddies that only run a single
:attack script, but be warned that there are other ways to make TCP bounce 
:packets as well (given an established connection) 
  The fact is that I am doing fine with all the other ways except for this one
  from the script kiddies and that's because they make my 100mbps NIC
  sing back lots of RSTs flooding itself (and the rest on the network path
  that packets follow) off.
