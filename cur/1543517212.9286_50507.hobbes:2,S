It doesn't appear to, at least according to bits/setjmp.h. Surely, any
point in a user app can quietly change flags, but Ingo's example of a
signal handler doing it seemed unlikely.
There's clearly no general fix for the existence of the direction flag
though, short of getting a non-x86 machine. We could lobby the GCC
folks for an -fassume-cld and maybe an -fpair-std, but it doesn't really
fix the problem.
