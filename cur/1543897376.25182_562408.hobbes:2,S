That just fired some rusty neurons.
#define XFS_IOLOCK_SHIFT        16
#define XFS_IOLOCK_PARENT       (1 << XFS_IOLOCK_SHIFT)
#define XFS_IOLOCK_INUMORDER    (2 << XFS_IOLOCK_SHIFT)
#define XFS_ILOCK_SHIFT         24
#define XFS_ILOCK_PARENT        (1 << XFS_ILOCK_SHIFT)
#define XFS_ILOCK_INUMORDER     (2 << XFS_ILOCK_SHIFT)
So, in a lock_mode parameter, the upper 8 bits are for the ILOCK lockdep
subclass, and the 16..23 bits are for the IOLOCK lockdep subclass.
Where do we add them?
static inline int
xfs_lock_inumorder(int lock_mode, int subclass)
{
        if (lock_mode & (XFS_IOLOCK_SHARED|XFS_IOLOCK_EXCL))
                lock_mode |= (subclass + XFS_IOLOCK_INUMORDER) << XFS_IOLOCK_SHIFT;
        if (lock_mode & (XFS_ILOCK_SHARED|XFS_ILOCK_EXCL))
                lock_mode |= (subclass + XFS_ILOCK_INUMORDER) << XFS_ILOCK_SHIFT;
        return lock_mode;
}
OH, look at those nice overflow bugs in that in that code. We shift
the XFS_IOLOCK_INUMORDER and XFS_ILOCK_INUMORDER bits out the far
side of the lock_mode variable result in lock subclasses of 0-3 instead
of 2-5....
Bugger, eh?
Patch below should fix this (untested).
Jarek - thanks for pointing what I should have seen earlier.
Cheers,
Dave.
