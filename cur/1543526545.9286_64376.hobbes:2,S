There is a small fix in 2.2.15pre9 for tulip, but for the most part, I
would say that the tulip driver in 2.2.x kernels is the most stable for
the most people, and the most widely tested.

You will get different answers from different people, but the only who
you can really answer your question is you, after testing various driver
versions.
I will take the time to work with you, if you want to test and help
debug the driver ---in kernel 2.3.x---
My best advice:  download and try the latest "stable pre-patch", version
2.2.15-pre9.  You mentioned LinkSys saying the problem in the kernel,
and that your oops was somewhere around tcp_keepalive.  That implies
that a general TCP fix might also cure your problem.
