Hi all,
I have verified that the READ_ONLY mmap mapping of file did not propagate 
to core file. For instance, if you share some file through which you exchange data
from one process to the other, you won't see it in debugger after the crash.
Is that known limitation? Can it be fixed?
best regards
Pavel
