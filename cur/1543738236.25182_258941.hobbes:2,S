you cannot do that. For every sys_xx there is a do_xx, that can
be called from inside the kernel.

These are are available for you to make syscalls from user mode
without library support (usually that brand new syscall you added).
They are basically wrappers that expand into C code. _syscallx, 
where x is the number of arguments the syscall needs.
