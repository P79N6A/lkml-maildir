The reason for a 'panic' is so the machine is halted long enough for
someone to find the problem. Registers, data values, etc., are preserved.
There exists a panic_timeout in panic() (../linux/kernel.panic.c). If this
is nonzero, the machine should reboot after a panic. However, I can't
find any documentation about how to set it. The code seems to show that
this value can be set in /proc/sys/kernel/panic. I have never tried it.
