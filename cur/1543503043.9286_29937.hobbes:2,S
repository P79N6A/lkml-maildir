My experience has been that the BIOS's use the RAM that would
otherwise be mapped in the 640k-1M hole for shadowing, so that is not
the reason for this problem.
The two reasons I have met are as follows:
 1. Some BIOS's grab a 4k block from the top of memory for their
    own use. Simply specifying 4k less than the amount of RAM
    present deals with this case.
 2. Systems with on-board video that use main memory as video RAM
    usually grab it from the top of main memory, but ONLY if the
    on-board video is enabled. I've never used a system that went
    and enabled it, but I would assume that one needed to reduce
    the memory size by the amount of memory used for it.
Best wishes from Riley.
