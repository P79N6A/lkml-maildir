That would be good. I don't expect you to do all the work,
but Opteron being a non traditional NUMA, and me doing most
of my testing on an old NUMAQ makes them quite important.
Even if you just got some results for a couple of random
benchmarks would be great.

Well we've survived OSDL's STP tests as far as I know. A
couple of regressions were found and fixed there, so that
was good.
