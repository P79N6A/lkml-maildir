Seems ok (see below). But i came to the conclusion that it might be
KMix as well, because alsa-mixer (console) works fine.
Maybe if the name of the output (or input) device (now both are
"Wave") is changed to be different from the other names the problem
will dissapear. I didn't have time to do this (i am not a programmer
also).
When i unmute in KMix input->Wave it works (sounds) perfectly. The
problem is that KMix is wrongly linking input->Wave as output->Wave,
as far as i can see.
Giving these channels diff. names in kernel will prevent this
 problem.

i saw (already in 2.6.15.1 as well) and i will try it in weekend
