This response I don't understand. How memory is described in a machine 
for DMA addressibility
is pretty standard (with the exception of memory on intel machine in 32 
bit systems above 4GBthat need page tables) --
a physical numerical address. But who is going to DMA into memory not in 
the address space.

Hardware doesn't care about page boundries. It sees hardware addresses 
and lengths, at
least most SG hardware I've worked with does. For ease of submission, an 
interface that
takes <address,length> would suffice. Why on earth would someone need a 
context
pointer into the kernel's page tables to submit an SG into a device, 
apart from performing
virtual-to-physical translation?

No, I do understand, and using page/offset at a low level SG interface 
IS burdensome.
I mean, if this is what I have to support I guess I have to use it, but 
it will be just another
section of code where I have another **FAT** layer to waste more CPU 
cycles calculating
offset/page (oh yeah I have to lookup the struct page * structure also) 
when it would be much
simpler to just submit address/len in i386 systems. With this type of 
interface, If I have for instance
an on-disk structure that starts in the middle of a 4K page due to other 
headers, etc. than spans
a page, I cannot just submit the address and length, I have to break it 
into two bio requests instead
of one with a for () loop from hell and calculate the offsets and rumage 
around in memory looking
up struct page * addresses.

No. I am used to programming to hardware with SG devices that all OS 
use. Is there somewhere a page based
SG device (other than SCI) for disk drive?. I don't think so, I think 
they operate address/len, address/len, etc.
