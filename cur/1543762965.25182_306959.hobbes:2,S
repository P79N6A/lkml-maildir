You have /etc/limits and /etc/security/limits.conf.
I think it would solve many problems by simply lowering the default
max_treads in kernel/fork.c. RLIMIT_NPROC is calculated from this value.

I don't think this will cause much problems for most users. (compare the
default maximum process limit in the BSD's and OSX)
This will also limit deamons/services started from boot scripts by
default. The /etc/limits and /etc/security/limits.conf does not.
If it does cause problems for extrem users, they can easily raise the
limits in either initrd and/or using /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max (or
systctl).
BTW... does anyone know *why* the default max number of processes is so
high in Linux?
