Been a while since I did a -dj, but I've accumulated a bunch
of driver stuff (which shouldn't crossover too much with what
Andrew is doing in -mm) that could use some extra testing,
so here's what I've been up to of late..
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/2.5.60/
(Thanks to Steven Cole for noticing the agp problems before I
 even got a chance to write the changelog 8-)
2.5.60-dj2
- Fix up modules versioning (Kai)
- Throw out some stale agpgart bits that broke the compile.
2.5.60-dj1
- cpufreq updates.
  - Athlon/Duron powernow cpufreq support.
    Handle with care. Only known bug is that the top speed
	isn't usable.
  - Updates various core parts, and other cpufreq drivers.
- AGPGART updates
  VIA KT400 support.
  Updated VIA AGP2.0 GART tables (PLE133 and others).
  Various cleanups.
- VIA C3 Nehemiah support.
  Compiles as i686/c3-2, works around L2 cache size errata.
- Watchdog fixes
  sc1200wdt PNP API conversion (Adam Belay)
- Lots of other leftovers from older -dj patches
  This stuff needs sorting, and some bits throwing out.
  There's lots of 2.4 forward port stuff here, and more
  pending.
- Latest from Linus' bk tree.
  (Just there to help me stay in sync)
