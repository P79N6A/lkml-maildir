Yeah, like running 2.4.9 kernel... why not 2.0.0 kernel? ;)
Also, see page 33:
Operating System                  Key Exchange Algorithm       Message Digest
Windows Server 2003               RSA RC4 (128-bit)            MD5
Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1 Diffie-Helman 3DES (168-bit) SHA1
Red Hat Linux 8.0 Professional    Diffie-Helman 3DES (168-bit) SHA1
and:
...
Set HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisableLastAccess to 1.
