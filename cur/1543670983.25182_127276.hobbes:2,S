Ok! I see the advantages / disadvantages of each version. But what happens if the memory AND swap space are full and nothing can't be freed? When I watch the memory and swap consumption on my laptop, I think it's the most time the case...
Another question:
Is it a big problem to save the memory in a separate file on the file system, and save somewhere the pointer to it (as example in swap. Also we could set a flag in swap so that we now that the last shutdown was a hybernation). One Problem will be, that we don't know the filesystem type on resume...(We could save the module in swap...)
All that is just theoretical. It's only a idea.
Thank you for your statements.
greets
Marc
