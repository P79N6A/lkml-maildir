In code paths where netif_rx_ni() is called, there is not a softirq return
path check, which is why it is checked here.
Theoretically, if you remove the check, softirq processing can be deferred
indefinitely.
What I'm saying, therefore, is that netif_rx_ni() it not just a performance
hack, it is necessary for correctness as well.
