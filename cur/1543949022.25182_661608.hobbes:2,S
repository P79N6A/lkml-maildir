Did you, at least:
* made a NTFS on that drive for a Windows test
* made a ext3 on that same drive for a Linux test
Or, is Linux using partition A, and Windows using partition B?
If it's the latter, such tests are not very meaningful.
Also, you gave too few details to say anything meaningful, really (did 
you drop cache on both systems before starting copying? did you sync 
after copying on both systems to see how long does it take? etc.).
