I just looked at <linux/genhd.h> (2.0.36) and it has
__attributte((packed)) which I think is the right way to spell it in
unadorned c.  The partition struct was invented for the 8 bit pc, which
had no notion of word alignment, so that is trying to tell the compiler
not to insert slack bytes to make the words line up.  Since it is 8
unsigned char followed by 2 unsigned int, it does line up, but if you
look at a partition record you will see that the struct is misaligned
within the record.  Where did you get your kernel headers? :-)
Oh, tar -tbzf was a typo, of course, I meant tvzf.
