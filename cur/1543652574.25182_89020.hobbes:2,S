Except that this function doesn't make any sense except for PCI devices.
I don't know whether there will ever be any devices that (1) call
`dev_alloc_consistent', (2) aren't PCI devices, and (3) would stand a
chance of ever working on this platform -- probably not.
Never-the-less, it provides (a non-artificial) example of a case where
it's wrong to assume that all busses are the same, and I think that
merits some attention.
