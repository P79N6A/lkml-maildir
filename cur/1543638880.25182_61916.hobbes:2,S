Argh. Yes. Thank's for the back-head slap.
I was looking too much at the SCSI code again and got it wrong.
But some time ago I was already thinking about blk_get_request().
How could I maintain that the blk_get_request() really returns?
blk_get_request() does only drain up to maximum queue depth as
far as I can read the code and then bad things wil happen :-).
Or should I just not worry?
