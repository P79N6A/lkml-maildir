Why?  What are you trying to do?  Allocate one area per small structure?
Why not allocate one big area and allocate from that (like the tulip
drivers do for their TX and RX rings)?
I don't really know what you're trying to do/what the problem is because
there isn't enough context left in the original mail above, and I have
no idea whether the original mail appeared here or where I can read it.

This is an absolute must.
