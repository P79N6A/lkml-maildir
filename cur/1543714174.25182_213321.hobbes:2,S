Sorry :-) Mandrake Community 10.0 using the 2.6.3 kernel with a patch to fix
the freezing when probing for the pcmcia card on this particular notebook
(see: 
http://www.muru.com/linux/amd64/
).

Tried various combinations in Windows and only using the 2 in combination
worked. I will test further in Linux if you like when I get the chance. But
as of right now I have a hunch that the same behavior will be observed in
Linux as one value enables burst stuff, while the other value when changed
also introduced distortion (micro-silence between buffers) in Windows if any
other value was used than 0x04.

Will do. I did that with the latency and it still worked for the
before-mentioned reasons but the preferred behavior would be having it at
0xff as that is how the Win driver behaves. However, changing the latency
on-the-fly while JACK audio server and audio is running results in corrupted
audio and JACK needs to be restarted (this is most likely issue with the
fact I was using JACK).

Well, in Windows the latency on the controller is 0x20 and then when the
cardbus soundcard (RME) is inserted it is changed into 0xFF. Matthias, the
support guy from RME also confirmed this behavior (that their driver is
changing the value upon connection).

Sounds like that was most likely it. I will test it as soon as I get the
chance to do so.
Thank you very much for all your help!
