That is a _useful_ bug report in itself. Though if you want maximum stability
you should not be running a -ac patch.

If people don't report problems then people can only conclude that the kernel
is perfect.  If people report bugs and expect rapid fixes to every bug they've
forgotten by pick a vendor of their choice and buy a support contract.
Silence is also not "nothing occuring", often its combinations of reports
that resolve a bug. One cases of "my computer crashed doing XYZ" may not
help but 5 of them all with the same hardware do
