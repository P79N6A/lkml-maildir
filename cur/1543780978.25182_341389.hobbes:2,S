Are you sure CacheFS is even the right way to do client-side caching?  What is 
wrong with handling the backing store directly in your network filesystem?  
You have to hack your filesystem to use CacheFS anyway, so why not write some 
library functions to handle the backing store mapping and turn the hack into 
a few library calls instead?
I just don't see how turning this functionality into a filesystem is the right 
abstraction.  What actual advantage is there?  I noticed somebody out there 
on the web waxing poetic about how the administrator can look into the cache, 
see what is cached, and even delete some of it.  That just makes me cringe.

Daniel
