FYI, to get good latencies for jack you currently need the -RT tree and 
CONFIG_PREEMPT. (see Lee Revell's and Rui Nuno Capela's extensive tests)
In other words, cond_resched() in might_sleep() (PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, 
which i announced Jul 9 last year) is _not_ good enough for 
advanced-audio (jack) users. PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is mostly good enough for 
simple audio playback / gaming.
