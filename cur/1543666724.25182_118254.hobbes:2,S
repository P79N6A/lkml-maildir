Subject: seqlock/unlock(&xtime_lock) problems cause keyboard, time skew problems

Since 2.5.60 my thinkpad keyboard repeat rate has been erratic when
started up on battery power; plugging into AC after startup only makes
it worse.  Starting up on AC is fine.  Compiling without apm in any
form is fine.
I posted on this a month ago and noone had solutions although I got
several emails from folks with similarly afflicted machines.
Since then I've noticed that I also get a bad time skew, with the
system clock jumping forward.
I'm pretty sure the problem arose with the introduction of the
seqlock/unlock interface to protect xtime_lock instead of a regular rw
lock.  Short of trying to back the whole thing out, does any one have
similar observations, suggestions, solutions?
