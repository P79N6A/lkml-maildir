My company has recently saved the money for buying another block of IP
addresses by switching to a private 10.x.x.x network and uses a linux machine
for masquerading.
We have had this setup in test operation for some time and I have been able
to prevent TCP connections (SSH) from beeing dropped by setting a very low
(120s) keepalive time on the remote machine.
Now that we have completed the migration this does no longer work.
According to our system administrator the only change was that he added an
additional NIC to support masquerading operation.
Any ideas?
Tom
PS: I would also be thankful if someone could tell me how to increase the
TCP timeout on the masquerading gateway.

company that can't stand one bit of competition.
