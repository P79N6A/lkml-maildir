Subject: Section mismatch warnings for early memory allocations

Checking for section mismatches across all of vmlinux is kicking
out a bunch of new warnings.  Many of them real, but I have a
few from routines like this:
foo(...)
{
	static int first_time = 1;
	if (first_time) {
		all_i_need = alloc_bootmem(NR_CPUS * xxx);
		first_time = 0;
	}
	... use smp_processor_id() to use pre-allocated memory ...
}
Now this is safe, since the first call to foo is made when alloc_bootmem
is still available.  But it kicks out a "Section mismatch" warning since
a non __init routine (foo) is calling an __init one.
Any suggestions on how to tell modpost that this is safe?
