                ^^^^^^^^^^ Pooaaahhh!:) What's this utter oddity ?
   Only dma 32 ? :-)
It is workaround for buggy drivers, when set it means that single SG
list entry request will be handled correctly.  When clear it means
that single entry SG lists are to be avoided by the block layer.
Many devices would explode when given single entry scatterlist. :(
It's naming is questionable... that I agree with.  The name should be
more suggestive to what it really means.
Franks a lot,
