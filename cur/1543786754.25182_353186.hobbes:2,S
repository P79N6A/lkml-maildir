As topic.
Suspend works perfectly, but after resume, no sound from audio card.
i see application works, for example i see xmms equalizer working, but
no sound,
even if i change manually volume.
only way is restarting the alsa init script. after that it works
perfectly.
not a critical bug, but may be very confortable to have registers
setted properly.
Some infos:
kernel 2.6.14-rc2-git4
alsa compiled built-in
audio card: ens1370 (creative pci128)
init script: Gentoo default one.
ready to add more infos if needed.
and test any patch, of course.
Patrizio
