Garrit, you missed the preior posters point. IA64 had the same fundamental
problem as the Alpha, PPC, and Sparc processors, it doesn't run x86
binaries.
the 8086/8088 CPU was nothing special when it was picked to be used on the
IBM PC, but once it was picked it hit a critical mass that has meant that
compatability with it is critical to a new CPU. the 286 and 386 CPUs were
arguably inferior to other options available at the time, but they had one
feature that absolutly trumped everything else, they could run existing
programs with no modifications faster then anything else available. with
the IA64 Intel forgot this (or decided their name value was so high that
they were immune to the issue) x86-64 takes the same approach that the 286
and 386 did and will be used by people who couldn't care less about 64 bit
stuff simply becouse it looks to be the fastest x86 cpu available (and if
the SMP features work as advertised it will again give a big boost to the
price/performance of SMP machines due to much cheaper MLB designs). if it
was being marketed by Intel it would be a shoo-in, but AMD does have a bit
of an uphill struggle
