Subject: [PATCH 06/37] ACPI: Fix mismerge in acpi_hibernation_finish
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/31/541

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Some code in acpi_hibernation_finish() was moved to acpi_hibernation_leave(),
but the old copy had been left (it's harmless, but also useless).  Remove it.
