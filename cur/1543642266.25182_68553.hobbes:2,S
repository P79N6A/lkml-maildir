Did you look at the list of supported Linux USB devices linked off of
www.linux-usb.org?  And the linux-usb-devel mailing list is probably the
better place for this kind of discussion.
If your device looks like a USB Mass storage device, then a kernel
driver modification might be needed.  Otherwise you are probably better
off using usbfs/libusb to talk to the device from userspace, which is
what the other USB Rio devices do.
Good luck,
