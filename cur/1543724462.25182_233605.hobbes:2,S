Up to 4 billion inodes, but it depends on the size of the device.  You
can create your filesystem with e.g. "-b 1024 -i 2048" to create 1 inode
for each 2kb of space.

This will give you 160GB of usable space, so 160 * 1024 * 1024 / (2 * 1024)
is 80 million, which is what you specified manually above, oh, you put
8 million unless that was a typo.
Yes, it would be good to have dynamic inode allocation for ext3, but it
hasn't been a top priority for anyone to implement it.
Cheers, Andreas
