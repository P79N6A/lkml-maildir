Subject: [patch 7/8] uml: fail xterm_open when we have no $DISPLAY
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/13/143

From: Chris Wedgwood <cw@f00f.org>
If UML wants to open an xterm channel and the xterm does not run properly (eg.
terminates soon after starting) we will get a hang (a comment added in the
patch explains why).
This avoids the most common cause for this and adds a comment (which long term
will go away with a rewrite of that code); the complete fix would be to catch
the xterm process dying, up(&data->sem), and -EIO all requests from that point
onwards.
That applies for some of the other channels too, so part of the code should
probably be abstracted a little and generalized.
