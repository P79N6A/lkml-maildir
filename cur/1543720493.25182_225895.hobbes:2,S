Hi:
Thanks for the replies for this thread. Yes, I found useful information
both in the man page and the txt file. Does anyone by chance know how to
disable hyper-threading in 2.6.x kernel? In kernels eariler than 2.4.20,
there was an option called "noht", but it no longer works for latest
kernels? Is it unsupported or changed to other options?
Thanks
-Yaoping
