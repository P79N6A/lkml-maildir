Steven,
This is really exciting!
As a former maintainer of the (out-of-tree) Kernel Function Trace
system, I really welcome this.  I'm just getting out from under
a backlog of work due to the holiday break, but I'm very interested.
I will take a detailed look at this this week.
I have been working with -finstrument-functions for a few years
now, so I know of a few gotchas with that (e.g. It's currently broken
on ARM EABI with GCC 4.x)  This bug is one of the issues that has
prevented me from attempting to mainline the KFT work this last
year.
Please keep me CC'ed on developments in this area, and let me
know if there are any specific things I can do to help.  I'd be
very interested in helping out with non-x86 arch support.
Regards,
 -- Tim
