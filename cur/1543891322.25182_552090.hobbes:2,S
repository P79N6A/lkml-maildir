Very well, but could you _please_ give us some time to do this?
We know of the problem now and will work to fix it, but it's not _that_ easy.
In fact, we also rely on the CPU hotplug's code that takes tasks away from the
offlined CPUs (and does the opposite with respect to the onlined CPUs), so
we just can't get rid of the CPU hotplug _right_ _now_.
