To test computer A, which has installed Linux 2.4.18 + all low latency 
patches.
1. Put ten (10) to twenty (20) files of 64-80 MB each in computer B. For 
example in /tmp/test.
2. Mount in B a disk in A via NFS in, for example, /mnt/A
3. In B, run the following command: 
cp /tmp/test/* /mnt/A
4. Check in A how you mouse freezes.
If you are a Debian Sid user, don't do any dist-upgrade for a couple of days 
and then try it. You will see the same mouse freezes when apt-get is 
installing/configuring packages.

Yes.
# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.32 seconds = 27.59 MB/sec

The PPC hasn't any problem at all, it was the NFS server who has killed 
kmail. There were not logged messages at all.
