I see this problem, for most desktop users the biggest task plus some
other random bit like the nicelevel and length of runtime etc.. actually
result in a reasonable estimate of the best task to kill.

no this is is not the case. It is always mentioned in the logs. Grep for
VM and you'll find all of them, no difference from before. I agree it
would be very bad if the admin couldn't know what was killed exactly to
restart everything properly (with the bad app under rlimit the next time ;)

this should go back to the 2.4.22 deadlock prone oom killer yes. you can
also leave the yield() in the main loop (after out_of_memory())
(__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING) isn't needed these days just yield is
safe enough).
