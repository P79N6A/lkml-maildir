All,
I just noticed this addition to i386 and x86-64, conditionalized upon CONFIG_KPROBES. May I ask what the motivation for
this compatibility breaking change is? Only performance? I consider it already questionable to split out a specific
fault from the general die notification (previous users of the functionality all of the sudden won't get notifications
for one of the most crucial faults anymore), but entirely hiding the functionality (unavailable without CONFIG_KPROBES,
and even with it not getting exported) is really odd.
Thanks for any clarification,
Jan
