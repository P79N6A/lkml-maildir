If they're misusing it, they should be fixed.  There should be a limit to
how much the kernel will do to reduce the pain of doing stupid things.

Well-written programs only call fsync() when they really do need the semantics
of fsync.  Disabling that is just *asking* for trouble.
From rfc2821:
6.1 Reliable Delivery and Replies by Email
   When the receiver-SMTP accepts a piece of mail (by sending a "250 OK"
   message in response to DATA), it is accepting responsibility for
   delivering or relaying the message.  It must take this responsibility
   seriously.  It MUST NOT lose the message for frivolous reasons, such
   as because the host later crashes or because of a predictable
   resource shortage.
Some people really *do* think "the CPU took a machine check and after replacing
the motherboard, the resulting fsck ate the file" is a "frivolous" reason to
lose data.
But if you want to give them enough rope to shoot themselves in the foot with,
I'd suggest abusing LD_PRELOAD to replace the fsync() glibc code instead.  No
need to clutter the kernel with rope that can be (and has been) done in userspace.
