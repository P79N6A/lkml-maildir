Hi Greg,
I was about to talk to you. There is a similar problem reported by
s390 people where we see parent kobject (directory) going away before
child kobject (sub-directory). It seems kobject code is able to handle
this, but not the sysfs. What could be happening that in sysfs_remove_dir()
of parent directory, we try to remove its contents. It works well with
the regular files as it is the final removal for sysfs_dirent corresponding
to the files. But in case of sub-directory we are doing an extra sysfs_put().
Once while removing parent and the other one being the one from when 
sysfs_remove_dir() is called for the child. 
The following patch worked for the s390 people, I hope same will work in
this case also.
o Do not remove sysfs_dirents corresponding to the sub-directory in 
  sysfs_remove_dir(). They will be removed in the sysfs_remove_dir() call
  for the specific sub-directory.
