I would love that, iff such a scheme does not (a) preclude "capabilities
full", and (b) it doesn't add potential unwanted interactions with
capabilities in metadata (its the _only_ reasonable place for them anyway)
or random careless setups. 
I'm not convinced that the overloading of bits + keeping metadata in the
executable file is at all secure (b), and I worry about (a).

That's part of the whole design, yes.

That looks like a lot more work than a simple "setcaps ..." on the affected
executables. Plus you _can't_ do it with your propietary database which you
need to trust for raw access to partition /dev/foo... and all to be able to
smuggle capabilities behind the system's back via tar(1) et al? Where (with
the inmutable bit) the whole idea of being able to use the existing tools
transparently is long lost anyway?
