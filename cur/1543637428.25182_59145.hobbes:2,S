OK, but essentially then <linux/io.h> will be mostly a hollow shell
which includes <linux/abi/io.h> and maybe a couple other files
(e.g. <linux/abi/types.h> or similar).  If so, then great.
That brings up the question - how do you tie a particular
<linux/abi/*.h> to a particular kernel?  Should there be a bunch of
directories <linux/abi-2.4/*.h> and/or <linux/abi-2.4.12/*.h> and/or
<linux/abi-`uname -r`/*.h> or what?  While there are efforts to keep
the ABI constant for major stable releases, this is not always true,
so abi-2.4 will certainly not be enough.  Maybe linux/abi is a symlink
to the abi directory of currently running kernel?
Cheers, Andreas
