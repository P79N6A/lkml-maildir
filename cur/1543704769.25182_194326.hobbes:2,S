These patches don't address the same problem.  Jake's problem has to do
with pci_scan_slot() ending too soon when going from function 0->7 at
boot time.  My problem has to do with pci_scan_slot() going too far from
function 0->7 at dlpar add time.  Greg, will follow up with you outside
of this thread.
Thanks-
John
