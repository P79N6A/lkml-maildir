Yes, it's needed.
Rather than having a strict policy which many people are going to 
violate because they don't understand all the intricacies, it would be 
beneficial to have a script that everyone uses which enforces all the rules.
Among other things, this reduces confusion and the barrier to entry.
More patches will be acceptable, and no one will ever have to clean up a 
patch which is really important but just not formatted quite right.
Hey, think about it.  We're computer geeks who should understand very 
well how computers can be used as tools to automate processes, taking 
the burden off of humans.  Given that dozens of patches are posted every 
day, this seems like a prime candidate for automation!
Furthermore, the script can be written to do interesting and helpful 
things that no one would consider putting into the policy because they 
would be too bothersome for the user to do.
If I knew bash, perl, python, or any other scripting language, I would 
volunteer.  I don't think you'd like my horribly non-portable C or C++ 
version, and I don't think Verilog, PHP, or Javascript would quite do 
the job either.  :)
