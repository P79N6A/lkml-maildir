Tejun,
This has always been the case.
By design, the kobject infrastructure is one such that allows for
different behavior implementations.  You could use it to accomplish
what you want and describe in your RFD, or you could use it to implement
what we have today or you could use it to implement completely different
(refcount) infrastructure.
