Interesting.
My little finger tells me that O/Ses that thread interrupts might well
want to rely on MASK + EOI in order to quiesce incoming level-sensitive
interrupts.
Note that tampering the IO/APIC after initializations looks extremally
ugly to me. In my opinion, only the local APIC was intended by Intel
designers to be accessed by CPU after initialization (I may be wrong
here).

Thanks for having tried my suggestion.
