Well no, that isn't so good either.  You shouldn't need "noapic"
for anything, either normal operation or suspend/resume.
Do ACPI events work properly w/o noapic if you don't suspend/resume?
You should be able to kill acpid, and cat /proc/acpi/event
and open/close your lid and watch events appear --
same for power button.
You should also be able to see the acpi line in /proc/interrupts
increment for each of these events.

Does noapic work properly before the suspend?
(test the same way as w/o noapic above)

The problem with your system is that it isn't getting ACPI interrupts.
The lid state in /proc is immune to that problem because when
you read that file Linux asks the hardware for its state on demand.
