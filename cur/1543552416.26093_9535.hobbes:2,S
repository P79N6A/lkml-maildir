the server just freezes. nothing on the screan. trying to ping the server
I realized the server is "crashed".

I posted this "problem" a while ago, and someone told me it is a 
known bug !? it crashs when you want to start the serial connection
(on redhat /etc/rc.d/init.d/serial). it arrived only when you put
a cable on a serial port and you do not connect it anywhere. it is
beacase "the serial connection is opened" someone told me.
