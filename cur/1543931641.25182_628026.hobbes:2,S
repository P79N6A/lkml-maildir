Yuck.  That means that runtime power management won't work correctly.
The same wakeup mechanisms that apply during SUSPEND and HIBERNATION
are also used for runtime PM(*) ... which is allowed by CONFIG_PM, and
which accordingly should not depend on PM_SLEEP.
I think the bug is that device_may_wakeup() now looks at CONFIG_PM_SLEEP
instead of just CONFIG_PM.

(*) Although ACPI has problems with the notion of runtime PM.  For
    example, it ignores PCI PME# signaling until PM_SLEEP transitions.
