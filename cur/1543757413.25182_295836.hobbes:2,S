On x86, it looks like a 3k increase in text size.  I know Matt Tolentino
has been testing it on x86_64, he might have a comparison there for you.
$ size i386-T41-laptop*/vmlinux
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2897131  580592  204252 3681975  382eb7 i386-T41-laptop.sparse/vmlinux
2894166  581832  203228 3679226  3823fa i386-T41-laptop/vmlinux
BTW, this PAE is on and uses 36-bits of physaddr space.
