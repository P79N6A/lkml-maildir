I am puzzled by this code and comment:
/*
 * smp_processor_id() "helpfully" screams when called outside preemptible
 * regions in current kernels.  sles doesn't have the variants that don't
 * scream.  just do this instead of trying to guess which we're building
 * against.. *sigh*.
 */
#define __mlog_cpu_guess ({             \
        unsigned long _cpu = get_cpu(); \
        put_cpu();                      \
        _cpu;                           \
})
First I think you mean "inside preemptible regions".  Second, it screams
because it's a bug to call smp_processor_id() from preemptible code!
Am I missing something?
