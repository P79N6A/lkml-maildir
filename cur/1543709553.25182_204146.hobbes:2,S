It looks like the largest portion of this code is actually not JFS specific.
Why not put the common code into fs/dmapi instead of fs/jfs/dmapi and then
there will be some possibility that the XFS and JFS DMAPI implementations
will become a single one (only one place to fix bugs, etc), and also give
the opportunity to have DMAPI support in other filesystems?
I'm sure Christoph will jump all over this (even though his name is in the
code), so I thought I'd do it nicely first ;-).
Cheers, Andreas
