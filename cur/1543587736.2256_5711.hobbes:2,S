mount --bind is a very nice tool to create multiple / directories for
diskless workstations.  Or, well, would be, if knfsd accepted to
export them.
I didn't try with 2.4.3 yet, only with an earlier version, does it
work there?  Or is it on womeone's todo?  Doesn't seem that
impossible, at least if you keep all the bindings on the same
filesystem and use nfsv3 with its larger handles.
  OG.
