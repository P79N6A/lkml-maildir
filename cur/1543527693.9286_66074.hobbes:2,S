3Com's driver is X86 only, crashes in seconds SMP and despite the SMP problem
being reported (at least claimed to be reported) to 3com by several people who
I've also talked to about 3c59x/3c90x hangs has never been fixed.
As far as 2.3.x goes, the 2.3.x network drivers are mostly out of date
with respect to 2.2.x. Jeff Garzik has been doing some work on resynching them
and once 2.2.15 is out we can sync the 2.2.14->15 changes into the tree.
