Honestly, I don't know either.  But I get an impression that there are
conversations underway.

AFAIK TiVo invented the practice, did they not deserve the credit?

Aah, I see.  Indeed, I'd missed that aspect.  Sorry about that.
My take on it is that bringing free loaders in doesn't help us much,
and bringing them in in a way that they don't learn the essential
aspects of the community will hurt the community in the long run.
So they must become aware that respecting others' freedoms is not only
the right thing to do, from a moral and ethical standpoint, but also
that this is precisely what enables our community to thrive, and to
enable everyone to get the best out of the software we cooperate to
develop.

Sure.  But getting those companies to adopt Free Software in a way
that turns it into non-Free Software doesn't change that in any way.
Of course we might get some additional contributions here and there,
but then more and more users would still be stuck, unable or limited
in the ways and incentives they have to participate in our community.
Permitting this is very short-sighted.  It might bring us apparent
advantages in the short run, but the more such disrespects there are,
the more there will be, and the fewer users will be able to become
developers.  In the end, this may kill the whole process, in a tragedy
of the commons.  In the article linked below, I argue this very point,
comparing how the demand for respecting users' freedoms is what keeps
the free-loaders away and makes the GPL the most cost-effective
license for software development, compared with permissive licenses
and non-Free licenses.  The very same arguments apply to a comparison
between a license that permits tivoization and one that doesn't,
because the latter is more likely to have more contributors to share
the load, and both equally reduce the likelihood of unmergeable forks.

I acknowledge this argument, but I hear the same arguments against the
GPLv2, claiming the barrier is too high, and it's not from people who
believe that tivoization is already prohibited.

Or to respect users' freedoms, enabling/motivating those users to
become developers in our community.

As long as they understand how the community works, be it from the
moral and ethical standpoint, be it from the pragmatic standpoint.  In
both cases, the end result is that they learn that, when they share
and cooperating, respecting users freedoms (enabling and providing
incentive for them to improve the software), everybody wins,
themselves included.

Of course, even more so!  Then you win not only the contributions from
the user, but also from the company itself, which you didn't have
before.
