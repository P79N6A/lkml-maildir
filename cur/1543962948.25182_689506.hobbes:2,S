Well, this printk had been suggested by somebody (sorry I don't remember 
who) when I first submitted the patch. Actually I think it might be 
useful for a sysadmin to be aware of a change in the msgmni value: we 
have the message not only at boot time, but also each time msgmni is 
recomputed because of a change in the amount of memory.
Also, at boot time, I think it's interesting to have the actual msgmni 
value: it used to unconditionally be set to 16. Some applications that 
used to need an initialization script setting msgmni to a higher value 
might not need that script anymore, since the new value might fit their 
needs.
