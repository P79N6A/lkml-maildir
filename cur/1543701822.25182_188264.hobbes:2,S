... and we already have a way to specify it explicitly.  Which, BTW, allows
to take server down, copy exported fs from failing IDE disk to SCSI one and
reexport.  With clients remaining happy with you.  Remember discussions
circa 2.5.50 or so about that stuff?
So we have tools for that.  And it's 100% OK to say "if you are doing NFS
export of filesystem that lives on $new_weird_device, explicit fsid= is
not just a good idea, it's a must-have".
What is _not_ OK, though, is to have folks suddenly see /dev/hda3 changing
its device number - then we would break existing setups that worked all
along; even if admin can fix the breakage, it's not a good thing to do.
