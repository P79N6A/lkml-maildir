Nothing against interbench, but how about something more concrete...
like a very modest parallel kernel compile in a slow NFS mount.  No need
to interpret results, it pokes you dead in the eye.
With my full change set, you _will_ see differences with interbench.
Interbench will say you're better off without my changes in fact.  Run
any of the known scheduler exploits without my changes, and then with,
and you'll likely consider revising interbench a little methinks ;-)
