I've been seeing filesystem corruption here (P2 UP, SR440BX mobo, IDE disc
WDC WD135AA) starting when I got this machine (2.3.20 was current). Never
had problems with 2.2.x kernels. Tried up to several 2.3.41pre on and off,
always got severe corruption (files transformed into directories or
devices, or the other way around (lately rare), weird user/group/permission
(also rare lately), duplicate blocks (usually between innocent bystanders
and new files, but also with files that had been deleted and halfways
resurrected somehow AFAICS (.o files cleaned from kernel compiles, for
example, later in lost+found)), lots of files in lost+found). A relatively
common way to trigger it was to get several compilations going
simultaneously, AFAIKS.
I applied 2.3.42aa2 on top of clean 2.3.42, compiled with Red Hat's
egcs-1.1.2-24 + binutils-2,9.5.0.24-1 (selfbuilt from sources for i585)
fsck(8)ed everything under 2.2.15pre5 (e2fsprogs-1.18-0, built for i686
from sources), all clean.  Compiled linux-2.2.15pre6, umount(8) + fsck(8)
of /usr/src, all clean.  Then built 4 RPMs in parallel, again no problems.
Not prepared just yet to give it a clean bill of health, tough...
