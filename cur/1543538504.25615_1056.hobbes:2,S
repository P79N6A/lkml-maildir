Subject: [PATCH] ide_setup eating all 2 letter boot args
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/7/9/10

Between test3-pre4 and pre5 the following was added to ide_setup:
if ( ... && (strncmp(s,"hd",2) && s[2] != '=')) return 0;
This line causes ide.c to think all two char boot args are for it, e.g.
ide_setup: sb=0x220,5,1,1 -- BAD OPTION
(and of course then the sound blaster driver complains that it
didn't get the mandatory i/o, irq and dma settings...)
Patch against test3-pre6.
Paul.
