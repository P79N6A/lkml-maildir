Along with all of the other comments from people, I have a few.

No, please create 1 patch per type-of-change.
So in this case you would have a series of patches:
	1) add the class iterator functions
	2-n) convert the existing places in the kernel using the
	     class->semaphore to use the new iterator functions
	n+1) convert class semaphore to mutex, which should only touch
	     the driver core
That way everything builds along the way, and it's easy to understand
and review.
Oh, and please start a new thread when you create a new patch like this
so it doesn't get burried in people's inboxes...
thanks,
