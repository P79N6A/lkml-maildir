Any chance that a device connected via serial (or an USB device which uses USB/Serial conversion)
triggers them? My cheap pl2303 device seems to send spurious BREAKs every once in a while, which
results in the described behavior, as the kernel will print the help line for any character which
is not a valid sysrq. (The probability to trigger another sysrq with random data is much lower, but
did you find any other printout of an sysrq in your logs?)
Best regards,
