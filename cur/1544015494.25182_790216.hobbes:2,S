Less usable in terms of ease of configuration and use?  Or
reliability?  In practice netdump's non-interrupt-driven polling mode
proved fairly reliable but it seems to me kdump provides more reliable
dumping than netdump.  Because you're performing the kdump from a
reliable new dump kernel (provided the initial kexec transition to the
dump kernel works properly).
