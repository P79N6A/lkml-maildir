 - you pci handling is rather bogus.  You must handle all initialization
   from ->probe and all teardown from ->remove.  No fuzzing with board
   count please - if pci_module_init returned success the driver must
   stay loaded
 - why is this one driver and not two?  Please split it into one driver
   for each hardware type
 - the procfs/sysctl support is rather gross.  For sysctl please use
   simple tabls like everyone else (e.g. look at fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_systl.c)
   Also new procfs entries are discouraged in general, but if you absolutely
   need them use the fs/seq_file.c interface
 - please convert to Russell's serial_core interface (drivers/serial),
   we already have far more copies of the old serial driver munged into
   various driver than nessecary
 - if you want compat code please always emulted older apis on old
   ones.
