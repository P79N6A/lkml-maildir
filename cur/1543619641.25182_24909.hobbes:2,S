I don't think you need to suspend I/O except momentarily. I don't use LVM and
while I can't resize volumes I migrate them like this
	mdhotadd /dev/md1 /dev/newvolume
[wait for it to resync]
	mdhotremove /dev/md1 /dev/oldvolume
the situation here seems analogous. You never need to suspend I/O to the
volume until you actually kill it, by which time you can just skip the write
to the dead volume.
(The above procedure with ext3 does btw make a great backup system 8))
