But it sure won't make any embedded people happy. This adds .text.exit
(and .data.exit?) to the kernel image, which is nothing but
unnecessary bloat. Nothing inside those sections is ever used, yet
their footprint does hurt on small systems.
I've been a bit sceptical of the whole .altinstructions idea,
self-modifying code opens a can of worms for anyone trying to do code
analysis (coverage, verification,...). But with this followup, I
personally pay money to get that stuff ripped out again.
