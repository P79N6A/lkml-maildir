I read it that he was getting an oops with just hex values cause 
he didn't have the symbols included (note the reference to "it 
just gives hex codes"). I could be wrong, since I'm only looking
at the quote of a quote of someone's interpretation. :)
With symbols included an oops DOES print the actual call trace in
readable form. (I've seen enough oops to be certain of that :)
