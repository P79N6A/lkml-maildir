True, the ticket spinlock certainly adds to the throughput results we
have seen.  However, the results without the ticket patch are still very
significant.   (IIRC, 500-600MB/s instead of the ~730MB/s advertised) We
can easily re-gen the previous results for an apples-to-apples
comparison.
Without the ticket locks we see spikes in cyclictest that have been
mapped (via latency trace) to the non-deterministic behavior of the raw
rt lock "wait_lock" (which is used in the rt lock code).   These spikes
disappear with the ticket lock patch installed. 
Note that we see these spikes while running cyclictest concurrently with
dbench/hackbench/kernel builds.

Can you elaborate?  Where did you previously see that this would be
problematic?

Certainly.  One of the things we have struggled with are real-world
loads that prove/disprove the implementation.  Thus far, everything we
have come up with has only seen improvement.  
The worst case we have come up with so far is running dbench/hackbench
in FIFO.  Here we have multiple tasks at the same priority contending on
the same locks.  This should give a worst case performance since the
tasks cannot preempt each other, and the nesting of locks should produce
significant latencies.  However, with the addition of the lateral-steal
patch, we do not witness that at all, rather the throughput is on par
with CFS results.
Higher priority FIFO tasks will preempt the polling tasks, and the lower
priority tasks will wait, as they should.
Are there some suggestions on workloads that would show how the polling
hurts?
