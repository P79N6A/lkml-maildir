Maybe not but...
You might like to try a context switching/thread wakeup performance
measurement against FreeBSD's libc_r. I'd imagine that it's difficult
to beat a system like that since they keep all of that stuff in
userspace since it's just 2 context switches and a call to their
thread-kernel.
I'm curious as to the rough numbers you got doing the 1:1 and M:N
comparison.
