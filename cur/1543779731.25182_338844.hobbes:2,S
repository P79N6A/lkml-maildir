I know that this benchmark is totally flawed, but I couldn't refuse to 
run it on my own and
to my surprise my numbers where the reverse! Running 2.6.12 gave my 
roughly 73 million
"cycles" while WinXP only gave me 28 million "cycles".
This result made me further test the difference in time() in Linux and 
WinXP and on my hw
(Compaq Evo N800c Laptop) it turns out that the time() call takes 
roughly 0.4 us in Linux vs
1.0 us in WinXP.
Using the GetSystemTime() functions in WinXP yielded the same values as 
time() did in Linux,
so it seams like that atleast on my hw that the time() and 
gettimeofday() functions are as fast
or faster than in WinXP. The question is of course why my results differ 
so much from Ciprians.
