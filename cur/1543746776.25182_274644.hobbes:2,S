Subject: [PATCH][REVISED] add list_del_head[_init] functions

Hi all,
I revised my earlier list_del_head patch and took Jens' suggestions.
There were two function additions:
list_del_head() - removes the head of a list and returns it
list_del_head_init() - removes the head of a list, reinitializes it
and returns it
I have also converted several obvious pieces of code in kernel/, net/
and mm/ to use these new functions. The patch for all of this is
attached. Thanks :)
Name: Add list_del_head[_init] functions for full queue API
Status: Tested (smoke tests, mostly)

P.S. Again, please CC me on any replies as I'm not subscribed to LKML.
Thanks again :)
