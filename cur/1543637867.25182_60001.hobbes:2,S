Do not use 147.32.127.222 aka ftp.sh.cvut.cz, which is part of
ftp.cz.kernel.org group. It was not updated for some time. We'll see
what sh.cvut.cz admin will tell us, but I assume that machine admin
left colledge at the end of June, and shortly thereafter mirroring
process died.
Use CUNI's 195.113.19.54, it should have same 100Mbps connectivity
to the world. If you want 1Gbps site, 
ftp.cesnet.cz/MIRRORS/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel, but it is not 
an official Linux kernel mirroring site.
