This is a namespace collision introduced with ALIGN() being moved to
kernel.h.  A patch below resolves this for sparc64 by not including some
non-asm headers when compiling assembler, although the namespace issue
itself may still need to be fixed (e.g. change ALIGN() to ALIGN_TO() 
in kernel.h ?).  
It looks like sparc32 has a similar problem.
