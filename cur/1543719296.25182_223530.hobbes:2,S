Looks nice to me.  Can you fix up the comments a little to use kernel-doc
style for function/structure defintion block comments and remove the useless
Description: for the top-of-the-file comments?
Also didn't we agree on making the export _GPL?
And after all that we have a nice hookin mechanism without users, so where
are the modules layering ontop of pagg hiding? ;-)
