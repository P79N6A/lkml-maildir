But that's not true _either_. That's only true because right now I think 
we cannot even suspend to a swapfile (I might be wrong). 
If you have a swapfile on a filesystem, you'd need those fs queues 
running!

Did you miss the email where Paul pointed out that Mac/PowerPC didn't use 
to do any of this? And apparently never had any issues with it? And 
probably worked more reliably several years ago than suspend/hibernation 
does _today_?
Ie we do have history of _not_ freezing things.  The freezing came later, 
and came with the subsystem that had more problems..
