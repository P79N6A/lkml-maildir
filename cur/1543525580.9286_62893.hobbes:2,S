Can you show the routing tables?  They are all on the same network,
so the kernel can choose whichever interface it pleases to send the
packets out, and if your routing tables are how I believe they are,
the kernel isn't making new 10.10.10.0 network destination routes
for eth1 and eth2 because one already exists for eth0.
I think you need to do a tiny bit of study on how IP routing
works :-)
