My question is: if we defer writing and in a way "loose" that 4096
bytes of memory (because we decide to keep the page in the memory for
some more time), how can a much smaller buffer_head be a problem?
I think we could always make a bigger reserve of buffer heads just for
this purpose, to make swapout more robust, and then don't impose any
limits on the number of the outstanding async io pages in the flight.
Does this make any sense?
