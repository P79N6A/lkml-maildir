None of the assembly routines seem to use toc register, so if the functions
exported from the library have special calling conventions (glibc would use
them from inline assembly wrappers anyway), you can get away without .opd.
vDSO is not in global search scope anyway, so applications can't call
symbols from it anyway unless doing lots of magic.
