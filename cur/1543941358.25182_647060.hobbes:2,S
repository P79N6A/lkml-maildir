It's possible. Is there a stream of these errors coming through constantly?

So, that is a ZONE_NORMAL high-order atomic allocation (GFP_COMPOUND as well
which is a little surprise but should make no difference). Not exactly
recommended but there are a few drivers that do it and I guess yours is one.

Coming from the driver in question so no suprise there

No apparent memory pressure there. We are not even below the low
watermark for order-0 allocations and the lowmem_reserve is not a factor
for DMA32 allocations.

There are sufficient numbers of order-2 and higher pages free there. It is
similar for the subsequent failures. This does not appear to be a fragmentation
problem at least so lets see what watermarks look like just for zone->low_pages
which should be relatively relaxed.
Zone watermarks in pages;
Low:                    1782
Free:                   1890
classzone_reserve:         0
Adjusted Low calculation
        low = 1782 - 4 + 1 == 1779
                ALLOC_HIGH for __GFP_HIGH so
        low -= (low / 2) == 890
                ALLOC_HARDER for !__GFP_WAIT so
        low -= (low / 4) == 668
Free pages at each order
DMA32: 1365*4kB 11*8kB 38*16kB 18*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 1*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 7756kB
Watermark check
        order 0: is free_pages(1890) < low(668) + class_rsrv(0) -- no, ok
        order 1: is free_pages(525)  < low(334)                 -- no, ok
        order 2: is free_pages(503)  < low(167)                 -- no. ok
Err, so it looks like we are not hitting the watermarks either. This does
not make sense, the allocation should not have failed. I have to be making
a mistake with the zone watermark calculation, can anyone spot it?
Is this definetly 2.6.24 and otherwise unpatched?

Few questions to try pinning down what is going wrong.
1. Is the stream of errors constant once they start?
2. If you increase /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to 16384 or 64738, do
   the allocation errors still occur? If the errors no longer occur,
   is the performance restored?
3. If you compile with MYRI10GE_ALLOC_ORDER=0 on the old and new
   kernels, do the allocations errors occur? If not, how does the throughput
   compare between kernel versions?
   (I am checking for changes in NFS/IO/writeback that causes a writeout
   performance regression. Such a slowdown may cause memory pressure
   later and then these allocation errors when watermarks are hit)
4. If you apply the patch below, do the allocation errors still occur?
   (The patch disables fragmentation avoidance. I don't think fragmentation
   is the problem here because ample memory is free and watermarks look
   ok)
5. Any chance you could test 2.6.23 in case the problem also happens there?
Thanks
