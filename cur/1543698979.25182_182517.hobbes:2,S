Ahh.. Btw, this looks like a single-bit error.
In particular, this is "list_del()" in remove_wait_queue(), and it's
list_del() on a list that usually only has a single entry (ie a wait
queue). In particular, it's the "prev->next = next" part, where "prev" is
5a85fb58 and next is da85fb58.
Now, with a single entry, prev and next _should_ be the same (they both
point to the head). And they are - except for a single bit error. The
difference is the high bit of the word. Interesting.
You get an oops because that 5a85fb58 _should_ be da85fb58. Notice?

It could be bad memory. We even know the address that is bad: it's
(%esi+4), ie bit 31 of the word at physical address 0x1b0468f0.
However, if you don't see random SIGSEGV's while compiling etc issues, it
doesnt' sound like flaky RAM.
I'm wondering if there is some bit operation out there somewhere with a
wild pointer?
Rafal - how consistent is the second form of the oops? Have you seen that
trace more than once? Might it actually be "poll()" itself that has some
bad behaviour?
