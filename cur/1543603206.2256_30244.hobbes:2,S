That is a BKL which we are trying to get rid of.
What deadlock is prevented by lock_kernel()
in tty_io.c:712?
write() call there is actually a tty->ldisc.write().
Is it possible to move lock into tty->ldisc.write()
and make it a spinlock? I'd like to try, but I admit
I failed to track what fn ptr is placed in ldisc.write
in my case (fb console)  :-(

I don't quite understand how locked region can start in
712/tty_io.c and end in 697/sched.c?
This is strange too:
>> 152903 spin_lock 5 547/sched.c   714/tty_io.c
spinlock? Unlocked by unlock_kernel()???
