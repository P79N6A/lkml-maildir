I'm pretty sure this is correct.  There's no particular reason to yield()
if we're unlocking.
I wonder if yield() is the correct call to make anyway.  We certainly need
to schedule() to allow any higher-priority task the opportunity to run.
But if we're the highest-priority task downgrading our write-lock to
a read-lock which permits other tasks the opportunity to run, i see no
reason we should _yield_ to them.
Scheduling is a bit of a black art as far as I'm concerned.  Someone with
a bit more experience care to comment?
