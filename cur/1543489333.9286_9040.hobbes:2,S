I get reproducable write errors when writing large files via nfs.
Its easily done by executing 'cat /dev/zero >testfile' where testfile is
on nfs. Problems get worse (occurs sooner)  when more than one process
is accessing the same nfs mount at the same time.
After several MBs written (often more than 100MB) I get an I/O error.
Further write request on the same filesystem lead to 'No space left
on device' errors, tough there is much space availabe. 
Both systems involved are running 2.2'er kernels (tested several
combinations, including 2.2.3) and kernel nfsd. (but I switched to
kernel nfsd from the old package because I had similar problems 
with the old one, too)
The two computers are connected by a direct 100MBit Ethernet line.
I may capture a tcpdump or provide other information on request.
The error seems to be on server side, as the 'no space..' message
can be seen by tcpdump.
