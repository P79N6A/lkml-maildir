Yes that is a reason to use copy_to/from_user, and it also checks to see
if the memory being used is allowed by the user.

Sounds like the authors of this driver don't know Linux kernel
programming very well.  If you want to test it, I would write a userland
program that uses this ioctl and pass in a bad pointer (NULL or better
yet, the location of schedule found in System.map).  If the machine
crashes, you got your answer ;)  Passing in an address of code might not
crash right away.  You may need to wait till the data cache writes it
out to memory, and the instruction cache reads it.  These two caches are
not always in sync on all platforms.
