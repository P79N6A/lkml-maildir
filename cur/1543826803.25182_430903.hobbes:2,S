I have not seen many systems where printk is totally disabled : it is useful to
have a trace of the kernel messages somewhere.

Yes the idea is to return, leaving the data in the buffers and not transferring
it to the console driver. As there is already another execution thread in the
relase_console_sem loop, it will take care of the data in its next pass in the
loop.

No, it is not lost.

irq disabling is the problem. And if this function stays with a standard
spin_lock (not a try lock), disabling interrupts is required.

Wait.. the release_console_sem calls the console drivers with interrupts
already disabled. I do not understand your last statement.

My main concern is more than just latency : missing 3 timer interrupts in a row
has an impact on the kernel time keeping. On systems where NTP is not available,
it can be important. Linux, if I remember well, deals with cases where one timer
interrupt is missed, but not 2. So, if we get one printk message on the console
each minute on a system at 100HZ, we will suffer of a 14.40s drift every day.
