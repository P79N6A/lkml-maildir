The directories themselves will have a maximum of 160 files, and the
files are maybe a few megs each - the delays are (as you pointed out
earlier) due to the ram restrictions and our filesystem design of very
deep directory structures that Netapps suck at.
My point is more generic though - I will come up with ways to handle
this problem in my application (probably with threads), but I'm
griping more about the lack of a kernel interface that would have
allowed me to avoid this.
