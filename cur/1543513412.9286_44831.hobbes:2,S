Hi *,
now more and more (IMHO off-topic) posts about what hardware
to use are starting to appear on linux-kernel and linux-smp,
I asked if there would be interest in a new list for the
purpose of discussing Linux and hardware.
Since quite a bit of interest has been shown, I created the
list as soon as I came back from ALS -- even before I have
recovered from jetlag and resulting lack of sleep :)
The list is: linux-hardware@nl.linux.org
To subscribe, you can send an email to:
	majordomo@nl.linux.org
with the following text in the body of the message:
	subscribe linux-hardware
regards,
Rik
