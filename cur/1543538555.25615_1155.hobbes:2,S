Hi all,
In 2.4.0-test{{1,2}{,ac*},3-pre*}, there seem to be some very weird things
happening which kill my machine:
- As soon, as the parallel port module (lp, parport, parport_pc) get loaded,
  networking and the mouse and keyboard in X die (checked networking with a
  ping from my second machine)
- If I happen to be on a VT, only networking dies -- _until_ I move the mouse,
  then the complete system freezes. If I don't move the mouse but remove the
  parport modules, networking doesn't get restored.
- The printing seems to be pretty hosed -- it prints a few pages, probably as
  much as fits into the printer's RAM (if I don't move the mouse :-) and then
  seems to be stuck.
I cannot recall whether that happened with 2.3.99* as well.
Some info which might or might not be relevant:
- PII/350 on a Gigabyte GA6BX/E board
- (sucky) Nvidia Riva128
- X running on VT7 (XF86_SVGA-3.3.6)
- gpm running on the console
- Logitech Mouseman Wheel PS/2, running with IMPS/2 protocol
- (old) RealTek RTL8139 NIC, shares IRQ with ES1370 sound card
- parport claims to use IRQ7 which is unused otherwise
Any additional info available on request.
Nils
