Is writing to the same testfile from multiple fsx's supposed to work?
It sounds like a surefire way to break the consistency checking that it does.
I'm surprised it lasts 9hrs before it breaks.
In the past I've done tests like..
for i in `seq 1 100`
do
  fsx foo$i &
done
to make each process use a different test file.
