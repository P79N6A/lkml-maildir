Not just when the stats are being read, but when the stats of that
particular task (A) are being read by one task (B) AND updated by the
task itself (A).

Hmm, which task? The request for stats does not necessarily/usualy
originate from the task we desire stats on. Hence the synchronization. 
In this way it's significantly different from lockless task_notify.

	You're referring to the performance impact of a global lock on a large
system. The lock Shailabh introduced is per-task. Those won't bounce
around nearly as much -- I think they bounce under the following
conditions:
- The task in which the lock is embedded is in the cache of processor A
and the task reading the stats of that task is on processor B.
- The scheduler bounces a task between processor A and processor B.
Am I missing any other circumstances under which it could bounce?

	The only potential problem I can see with using task_notify for
gathering statistics is each section of code that increments stats would
have to look for its notify block in the task's list.
