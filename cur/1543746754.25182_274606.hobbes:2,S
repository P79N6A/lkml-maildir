I've no idea whether the workaround is simply not supposed to be used on
fibre devices (I'm suprised the driver works on fibre full stop 8)). Its
certainly possible to do a cleaner change though even if nobody can work
out why.
Use lspci -v to find the subvendor/subdevice ID for the particular board
assembly and then skip the fixup for that device alone. That should let
you produce a diff that is safely mergable
