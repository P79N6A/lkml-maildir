Hi,
I have following problem.
I want to access the list of the ip numbers assigned to a network device.
so far I was not able to find a field, from which I could read any IP
related info.
In inetdevice.h I have found a "in_device" struct, where the list is stored, but
I was not able to connect this struct to sk_buff nor to dev (information available
in 
foo_xmit(struct sk_buff *skb, struct device *dev);
the closest thing was ifindex (which is changing with the device)
the ip_ptr sounds promissing, but it is (void *)    :(
with regards, Gregor
