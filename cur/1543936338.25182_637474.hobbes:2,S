It needs to be reviewed.  In exhaustive detail.  Few people can do that and
fewer are inclined to do so.

I went to merge it so it could get some testing while we await review but
the patch has all its tabs replaced with spaces, is seriously wordwrapped
and has random newlines added to it.  Please fix email client and resend
(offlist is OK if it is unaltered).
We should have a think about which workloads are most likely to be
adversely affected by this change.
