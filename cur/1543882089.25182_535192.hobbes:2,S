This file may be a good idea in general. I'll see if I can come up with
something useful.

I think it is more consistent if the driver takes care of the fields
specifically designed for its usage.

OK, thinko on my side.

I'm still concerned about that problem. It is that there is simply no
guarantee that everybody released their reference before the module's
exit function returned (the driver itself can and must assure that it
drops its last reference before it finishes exit, but it just can't
control who else holds a reference). I'm much in favour of adding a bit
of code than to risk oopses about which the driver can't do anything
itself (plus, the race exists now, but the immediate disconnect will
involve auditing all drivers).

Yes. Especially since the "gone"-field may be contained in that
embedding structure if the subsystem controls it.
