Which is why that particular patch is wrong:  "ubuf" is a dma address,
not expected to work for memcpy().

A similar bug was fixed in 2.6 by a patch from Russell King.  I think
the 2.4 version has lingered since it only affect EHCI, and most folk
using EHCI won't use bounce buffers.
Could you look at that patch (bk revtool or bkweb will show it, early
September 2002) and provide a 2.4 version?

What changed in 2.6 was that hcd_submit_urb() has a special case for
the root hub.  That's always PIO, so the code now bypasses all the
DMA mapping code when an URB is destined for a root hub.  The original
code accidentally assumed no bounce buffering would go on.
