mmm... I don't use PPP at all, nor dhcp. 
My DSL box act as a NAT-router. Its local adress is 192.168.0.254 and my PC 
is at 192.192.0.9 (fixed IP).

Firstly, I suspected a bug in the DSL box, so I reset it but it did not help. 
I have to reboot the PC (don't need to reset the DSL box). 
Could a router problem prevent "ping 127.0.0.1" from working ?
[this becomes somewhat off-topic for LKML, sorry]
Here's my routing table:
linux-2.6-mm$ LANG=C netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.0.254   0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
It seems it lacks a route for 127.0.0.1 through lo, isn't it? In this case, if 
eth0 hangs, 127.0.0.1 hangs too, no?
So, it could be an ethernet driver bug. I'm using ne2k-pci.
