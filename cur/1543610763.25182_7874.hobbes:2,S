The only way we can get good testing for new kernels is to stop using
-preN prefix in development branch (2.5.x). Just increment that 'x'.
This will eliminate 'people waiting for final 2.5.N' problem.
(2.5 is unstable, so it's normal for it to break even in silly ways
as code gets patched/rewritten)
We can't do that for 2.4, for 2.4 scenario is:
Joe User: I see this oops in 2.4.18!
Maintainer: please try this 2.4.19pre1 I made for you
J: still oopses
M: hmm... try this 2.4.19pre2
J: YES YES YES it works now thanks
   - several days have passed, M may have some afterthoughts -
   - and updated preN's, can feed them to J etc... -
M: Do you see anything unusual since pre2?
J: No
M: He he me is cool, let's announce 2.4.19
