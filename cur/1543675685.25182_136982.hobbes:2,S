Well, I think it's the _main_ reason for most of us coding this way. When
you're used to read it this way, it seems completely normal, and other methods
seem strange. I even used to put the opening brace on the same line as the
function, because I don't like having a line with a single char, I find it a
wast of screen space. But the kernel coding style slowly makes me move forward
to its method.

I can agree with you on this point. It's only that since I'm not used to read
it this way, I have to make an effort finding the type, even if it's just above.
I will try to use this method just to see if I can feel comfortable with it.

I just found through google that C programs are indeed formated as you say,
but C++ programs have the type on the same line as the name. So if this
comes from this origin, we'll be able to say that Linux contains no C++ except
its formating :-)
