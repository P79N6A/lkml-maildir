I did that...
Disabling PM made it boot:
< CONFIG_PM=y
< CONFIG_APM=m
< # CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
< CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
< CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
< CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
< # CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
< # CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
< # CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
---
> # CONFIG_PM is not set
I think I still had swsusp on before I disabled PM...I will have to test more 
tomorrow to make sure thats it...
Perhaps its the CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE that did it?
I had tried linux init=/bin/sh, which got to the shell, then 2 seconds later 
paniced, so I have a feeling its the idle thingy:)
On another note, pcibios_read_config_dword seems to be missing, and 
pcmcia-core wants it.  I'll have to see whats up with that tomorrow...but at 
least I got it booting now:)
