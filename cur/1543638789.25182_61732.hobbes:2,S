I don't think the hangs had anything to do with ntfs. The io errors, I was 
able to reproduce on 2.4.19+ntfs but only when accessing compressed files. 
I have fixed this in the latest ntfs, at least the errors I saw are gone.
Could you give it a try and let me know if it solves your problem, too?
You can download by pulling from bk://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-tng-2.5 or 
by applying the patch I sent to LKML last night. I can forward it to you if 
you need it...
btw. I think it was compiler problem, so out of interest, which compiler 
are you using? I was using gcc-2.96-RH7.3-latest...
Thanks,
         Anton
