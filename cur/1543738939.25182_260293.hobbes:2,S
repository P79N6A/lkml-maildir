I may have been lucky with -T8 where it made it through a complete boot and
shutdown cycle (spewing lots of messages), but -T9 appeared to start OK but
died
with the following messages displayed. [my back was turned, so I am not
sure the
step in the init sequence that was active, trying again...]

Had to cycle power to get system to reboot; watching more closely this
time.
Of course, the second time it boots all the way but was spewing some (not a
lot)
of messages related to the network interface I have (8139too). I tried to
login
but the system hung before displaying anything interesting. Rebooted with
-T3
again to get some work done. Will send the boot messages separately.
