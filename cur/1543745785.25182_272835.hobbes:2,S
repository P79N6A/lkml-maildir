The initial patch submitted to Andrew didn't include the NUMA
support hence it is not expected to work on NUMA. We are testing
the DISCONTIG_MEM patch, we will submit after finishing the testing.

First set of patches are only meant to support 32bit x86 platform.
Plan is to support Opteron and other platforms after stabilizing

You can try on i386 UP and SMP boxes. Thanks for your help
in testing these patches.
