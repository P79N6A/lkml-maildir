And for a very good reason. A few things really need asm, for example getting 
a CPU in protected mode, setting up the MMU and stuff. Once they are set up, 
you can use C, though sometimes you must be really sure what your compiler 
will make from the C.
So, why assembly ? Cause it is needed. Why in arch/i386/boot ? for if it is 
well done there, it isn't needed at many other locations. A few things will 
still require asm though, therefore you'll find more .s files in arch/i386.
