It seems that your kernel performs writes slowly.

2.4.18-3 is particularly bad know for this exact problem (slow write speed),
you should consider upgrading to at least 2.4.18-5 kernel from redhat updates.
For me on plain 2.4.18 the problem is not visible that bad as for you.
I.e. ls on a directory where I write this big file finishes in under
half a second.

You said 2.4.19 writes stuff faster for you, how about testing ls on that
kernel?
