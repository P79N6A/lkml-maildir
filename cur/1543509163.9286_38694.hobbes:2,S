i understand what you mean, but Linux kernel's speed is a 'sum' of many
such 'undetectable' improvements. You cannot remove any of those speedups
just because the speedup is undetectable.

thats the hard part i think too. One way to do it is like for exceptions
(check out how exceptions build their tables, Documentation/exception.txt)
: patch int3 into the necessery places if RT is enabled (int3 [or
equivalent] in this case is a full replacement for all 4 type of
instructions, cli, sti, popfl and pushfl), then search the 'exception
table' for the address. (the return address is pushed onto the stack by
int3) This search can be rather slow though, and thats the main problem i
think. There is no cost to the main kernel, apart from the (presumably not
very big) kernel-resident address-tables.
