There's perhaps one thing that might help us to see whether it's just a 
benchmark effekt or a real problem:
With Tim's CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8, NR_IRQS only increases from 224 in 2.6.18 
to 512 in 2.6.19-rc.
With CONFIG_NR_CPUS=255, NR_IRQS increases from 224 in 2.6.18
to 8416 in 2.6.19-rc.
@Tim:
Can you try CONFIG_NR_CPUS=255 with both 2.6.18 and 2.6.19-rc5?
