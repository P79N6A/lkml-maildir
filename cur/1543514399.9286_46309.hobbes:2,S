The autoprobe stuff works quite well if tou use just one card. To use
two or more, you need to specify in /etc/conf.modules an option to your
device, like:
options wd io=0x280,0x300
Now you can bring your two interfaces up.
This is the only manner i can did to work, this also w/ NE2000 ISA
cards. 3com boards doesn't appear to have this kind of trouble.
Also, if you use wd inside kernel, you need to pass a append option in
your loader, as sometimes eth0 turns eth1, and so on (is this a BUG?).
