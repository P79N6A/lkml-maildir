What about the following solution:
arch/powerpc/Kconfig.qe:
<--  snip  -->
config MACH_SUPPORTS_QE
	bool
config QE
	bool "QUICC Engine Support"
	depends on MACH_SUPPORTS_QE
	help
	  ...
<--  snip  -->
arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/Kconfig:
<--  snip  -->
...
source arch/powerpc/Kconfig.qe
config PPC_MPC836x
        bool
	select MACH_SUPPORTS_QE
	...
....
<--  snip  -->
