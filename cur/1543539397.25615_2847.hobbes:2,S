Because you're presenting it as a big deal and you're presenting a
"solution" that is and can only be a minor deterrent. 
I for one am not at all surprised that there's a way for root to break a
drive. I expect there are plenty of other ways too. I know of ways to
destroy DIMMs and the X man pages warn about damaging your monitor with
bad mode lines. VA Linux has a note on their hardware burn-in test suite
page that they've had instances of machines catching on fire.

No, of course not, but we also don't want to make large changes to the
kernel to paper over a hole that we can't cement closed. Especially now.
