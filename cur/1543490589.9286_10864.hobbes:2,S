I tried to "dump 0f /mnt/misc /" but although there were still 781961216 Bytes left on the device dump asked me for a new volume after 39260160 Bytes. The man page says it will only ask for a new tape when an end-of-media indication is returned. Dumping to and redirecting stdout finally lead to the desired result :-)
