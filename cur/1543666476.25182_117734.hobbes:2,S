I suppose the first thing to point out is that it would be helpful if
you could send this to linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org.  Although most SCSI
people also read linux-kernel, it is easy to lose things in the noise.

You already have the pc98_bios_param as part of your local driver.  Why
do you need this in addition?

This really doesn't look right.  For non PIO (which is all drivers apart
from yours), they expect to dereference SASR to get the port number (as
an unsigned char).  If you remove the dereference, don't they all break?
Perhaps the better thing to do is to make your driver use an unsigned
int *, so the dereference works in all cases.
