No, I think I'll keep my 5 bucks, cheap bastard that I am.
The thing is, enabling ACPI will also force the _correct_ routing of the
SCI interrupt (assuming ACPI works - it doesn't on all machines), and thus
it doesn't show up as some random other irq. Which is why you don't get a
lockup.

There won't be any explicit loop - what will happen is that irq12 will
stay active, so we will keep on having irq12 interrupts that the CardBus
interrupt handler doesn't know what to do with - and immediately when the
irq handler returns and acks the interrupt we'll just take the irq again.
Over and over.
