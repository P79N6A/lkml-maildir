Hi Ted
Do you know who added the following patch in 2.3.19
and what its purpose is?
It's breaking systems and HOWTO's. It's getting difficult
to convince serial.c to give up its lock on the ioregion
if one has another driver that also drives 8250 style
serial ports (such as baycom_ser_*).
Thanks Jean-Luc f5ibh@db0bm.ampr.org for finding the problem.
setserial /dev/ttySx port 0 seems to be the only way
to convince serial to give up a particular port. 
Tom
