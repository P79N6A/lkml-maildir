 This was a comment on the "loop detection" claim.

 _In_ SMTP, that doesn't say anything about MX records to me and even
if it does it's very old and needs to change.

 So... you should have the reverse for the ip address after the
220. Which most people do (but not all, mainly due to there not being
enough ips).
[snip CNAME lesson]
 The question was, why can't you use CNAMEs. You said 'because of loop
detection'. I said 'But that doesn't work anyway, because you can have
to names pointing at one machine without a CNAME record ... and that
needs to, and currently does, work'.
