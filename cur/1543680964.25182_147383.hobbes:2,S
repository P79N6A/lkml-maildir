Ah, _thank you_.
It's not an rpm bug, as such; it's a problem/bug with DB4, the
Berkeley DB library.
I just spent 2 hours trying to figure out why rpm was failing.
write() returning EINVAL for no reason?  Finally spotted that O_DIRECT
was the significant bit.
I don't raise any eyebrows when rpm has a bug - after all, it's had
quite a few.  But I was disappointed to find Berkeley DB's own db_dump
unable to read the rpm database too.
End result: I copied an rpm database from another machine.  It's wrong
for this machine, but nearly right.  Ah well.
If I'd only known about the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL fix sooner.
Can this go into Documentation/Changes, please?
