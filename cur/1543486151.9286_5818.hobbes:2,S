Is there any way to do this with the 2.2 SMP code? A colleague is implementing 
his own language for research purposes and wants, in effect, to schedule his 
own threads on the available CPUs. The obvious way to do this seems to be to 
run one "real" thread locked onto each CPU.  I know that threads will 
typically stay on the same CPU they were on anyway, but I can imagine an 
ill-timed intervention of a third process (in the case of 2 CPUs) resulting in 
both his processes trying to run on the same CPU.	
If this is not possible at the moment, can anyone (a) comment on its 
feasibility (b) advise us on where to look to implement it or 
(c) comment on its desirability as a new feature.
