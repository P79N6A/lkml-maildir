	Other than that it's required by the POSIX standard, can you see any real
use for this? It's generally an obstacle you have to code around.
	What I would suggest is that the Linux kernel continue the way it is. The
race conditions in this are unavoidable, so let's just acknowledge them and
live with them.
	The pthreads library can do the horrible deed of getting each thread to
change it's *id. At the very worst, add a kernel facility to change all the
*ids in a group and let the pthreads library code use it.
	But to hack the kernel to have one set of *ids for all the threads is
illogical. It would make it unduly hard to have different threads serving
requests on behalf of different clients with different security contexts.
