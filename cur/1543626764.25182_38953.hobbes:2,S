Subject: [PATCH] 2.5: don't miss a preemption oppurtunity
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
The new kernel preemption code in 2.5 is great.  The only missing bit is
a check for need to reschedule at the end of the preemption handling
code in preempt_schedule and entry.S.  Anytime preemption is disabled,
there is a possibility kernel code could set need_resched and try to
preempt.  We need to check need_resched as soon as we reenable
preemption (preempt_count=0) in these code paths.
Right now this window exists anytime after resume_kernel sets
preempt_count to 0 and after return from schedule when preempt_count is
also set to 0.  Note they can last as long as the next interrupt - or
longer if a lock was grabbed in the interim.  This is a decade in
real-time land.
This patch, against 2.4.8-pre2, adds a simple check for need_resched to
the end of these codepaths and jumps back into them if needed.  Please
apply.
	Robert Love
