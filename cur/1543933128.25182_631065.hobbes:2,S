Well, the only mechanisms I know to get things synced are the ones 
I mentioned before: 1) generate an interrupt, 2) write to memory 
which has the "barrier" attribute. Obviously 1 is out - giving  
the memory used for status indications the barrier attribute is 
the most primitive means I'm aware of.
