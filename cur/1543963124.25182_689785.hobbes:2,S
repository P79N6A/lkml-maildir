Well, it doesn't have the irq stuff, which is also pretty costly. Also, it 
doesn't nest the accesses the same way (with the counts being *inside* the 
spinlock and serialized against each other), so I'm not 100% sure you'd 
get the same behaviour.
But yes, it certainly has the potential to show the same slowdown. But 
it's not a very good patch, since not showing it doesn't really prove 
much.
