Hi Mark,
Thank you very much for your quick responses to my problem. 
Due to your help I was now able to solve both problems. 
Now everything works great (including UDMA and the ethernet NIC 
and ACPI)
[however, the rtl8139 still refuses to work, but I can use the eepro100]. 
The three core things were: 
- switch off apic stuff
- you may enable ACPI but you must _disable_ ide power down 
  in the BIOS (seems to be a bug somewhere)
- This message is normal and can be ignored: 
  PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:11.1. Please try using 
    pci=biosirq.
Regards,
Wolly
