Sorry I confused you, but the source didn't use the variables as it 
should.  GC_PSX_LENGTH should be 8 meaning we read down 8 bits (1 byte) 
at a time.  I'll create new variable called GC_PSX_BYTES set to 6 
meaning we can pull down up to 6 bytes in a row for a single read.

 From what I see Vojtech accepts them and then Linus eventually pulls 
from Vojtech's tree.  Here is my modified patch.  Please test it to 
double check it works.
