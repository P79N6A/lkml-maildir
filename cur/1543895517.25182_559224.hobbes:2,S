+config QUOTA_NETLINK_INTERFACE
+	bool "Report quota messages through netlink interface"
+	depends on QUOTA
+	select NET
+	help
+	  If you say Y here, quota warnings (about exceeding softlimit, reaching
+	  hardlimit, etc.) will be reported through netlink interface. If unsure,
+	  say Y.
Using "select" is either evil or OK, but only OK for "library-type" code.
It should never be used to pull in a complete subsystem like NET does
(even though SCSI_NETLINK does this same thing, sadly).
