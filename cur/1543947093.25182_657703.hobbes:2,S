No of course not.
I totally agree we should be more agressive in merging drivers earlier.
A minimal review needs to happen so for a few things imo
1) That the driver doesn't break the build
2) That the driver has no obvious huge security holes
   (this is a big deal for unsuspecting users)
3) that there's not an obscene amount of "uses deprecated api" compiler warnings
   (since those are annoying for everyone else)
4) that people who don't have the hardware are not negatively affected
   (say crashes without the hw or so)
beyond that.. that's what EXPERIMENTAL is for
(joking; lets not open that can of fish)
