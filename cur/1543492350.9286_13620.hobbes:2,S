A couple of people have suggested a possible X crash.  I should have
explained why I had ruled that out.  I have a couple of programs, started
from console ttys and completely independent from X, which make frequent
writes to files.  Though I let the machine sit for ten minutes after it
froze, neither of these programs wrote anything after the moment of the
crash.
Also, there's always some disk periodic activity on my machine, but there
was none after the crash.
