   I have a unrelated question about TLB flushes: I think I found a
   problem for architectures that access "current->active_mm" from the
   tlb flush IPI: Between switch_mm() and switch_to(),
   "current->active_mm" and the loaded mm can differ.
   i386 was broken, and I sent a patch to Linus last week.  Could you
   check if Alpha/Sparc have the same problem?
Sparc64 should be ok, the only way we ever check current->active_mm is
to compare it against the mm passed into the flush routine on SMP and
we perform certain xcall optimizations only of they are equal.
Later,
