Subject: [PATCH - 2.2.12, via-rhine v1.01] rx statistics bug (back again)

Hi Folks,
It seems that the via-rhine driver v1.01 in 2.2.12 (and 2.2.11, too I just
noticed) has lost the ability to keep track of how many bytes it has
recieved via the /proc/net/dev interface again.  It looks like when the
driver was upgraded to v1.01 from v1.00 a line of code was lost (according
the 2.2.11 patch). Here's a one line patch to bring those back, and keep
my WMNet graphs happy.  ;-)
