I'm trying RH AS 3.0  kernel, however I have the same behavior on my 
SuSE 8.2 workstation. 
I use 2.6.3 kernel for tests now (It is not the latest I know) 
EXT3 file system.
3WARE has writeback cache setting in both cases. 
Here is the test program I was using: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <errno.h>
char buffer[4096] __attribute__((__aligned__(4096)));
main()
{
  int rc2,rc;
  int i;
  buffer[0]=(char)getpid();
  rc=open("write",O_RDWR | O_CREAT,0666);
  if (rc==-1) printf("Error at open: %d\n",errno);
  for(i=0;i<1000;i++)
   {
    rc2=write(rc,&buffer,4096);
    printf(".");
    fflush(stdout);
    if (rc2<0)
      {
        printf("Error code: %d\n",errno);
        return;
      }
  fsync(rc);
   }
}
