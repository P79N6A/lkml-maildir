It is functionally equivalent. The motivation is not so much
performance as API conversion. I am personally taking it upon
myself to deprecate for_each_process() and do_each_thread() and
update the mergeably correctible callers. The deprecation motives
are both efficiency and correctness related.
It should improve performance in whatever sense performance is
interesting from the point of view of this function; however,
it is not motivated by that fact (and performance is not of interest
with respect to most security functions). It is API conversion.
Thanks,
Bill
