What you need is a small number of fast, expensive drives, and a large 
array of cheap drives, and use the fast drives as a cache for user files.
But this is completely different from elastic quotas.
My solution to this would be to have large arrays of cheap disks and put 
lots of RAM in the server and let RAM be the cache.
