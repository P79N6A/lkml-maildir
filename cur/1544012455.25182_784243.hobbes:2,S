what about some "make modules_install_compressed" instead ?
as i have run out of diskspace quite often when installing test kernels, i 
think we really need a feature like this.
i`d also favour the makefile approach.
why another kconfig option?
jan`s patch looks clean and simple, but i think it`s a little bit 
intrusive...

roland
ps:
i`d use gzip without "-9" as this gives very little space savings. it mostly 
burns cpu and slows things down too much.

Hm, all I needed was this patch. It might fire up some people,
but it's got all the scalability I could think of..
