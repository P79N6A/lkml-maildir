That's a sure way to cut down on the number of bug reports ;)
Not to mention that it makes cross-posts between various lists
pretty much impossible.
Also, considering the amount of spam I've received "from myself"
and "from" linux-kernel regulars it's pretty obvious that restricting
the posting to list members just isn't going to work any more to
prevent spam.  It might still work for the next few months, but
the trend of spammers harvesting from/to address _pairs_ to get
around people's spam filters is definately getting explosively
more popular...

Rik
