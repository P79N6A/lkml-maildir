Hello,
I get the following message under 2.4.21 from RedHat:
CPU 3: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
<Bank 0: b20000001040080f
and the box is dead.
When i use parsemce, it said:
Status: (4) Machine Check in progress.
Restart IP invalid.
parsebank(0): b20000001040080f @ 3
        External tag parity error
        CPU state corrupt. Restart not possible
        Error enabled in control register
        Error not corrected.
        Bus and interconnect error
        Participation: Local processor originated request
        Timeout: Request did not timeout
        Request: Generic error
        Transaction type : Invalid

Can anybody please enlighten me what this means or what a possible
problem behind might be?
Thank you in advance
