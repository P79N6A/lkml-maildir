Hmm.. suppose this is the problem anyway and that Jens patch was not enough.
How do the disk drive sound during the test?
Does it start to sound more when performance goes down?
About Jens patch:
My feeling is that there should be (a lot) more  READA than READ.
since sequential READ really only NEEDS one at a time.
Number of READ limits the number of concurrent streams.
And READA limits the maximum total read ahead.
Jens said earlier "Roy, please try and change
the queue_nr_requests assignment in ll_rw_blk:blk_dev_init() to
something like 2048." - Roy have you tested this too?
