I meant the equivalent of cvs uses cases not the equivalent of three cvs
commands, e.g. how would I handle cvs branches and join branches, how do
I check out a specific version/date, how do I track external sources,
which are not using bk, how do I get grep/cscope/... working without
doubling the needed disk space with bk -r co.
bye, Roman
