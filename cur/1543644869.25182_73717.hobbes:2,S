Maybe I should try XFS? I've heard of people running this for
80+ days and no downtime. I really would like to get past 8 days.

Yes i know. My experience seems to be bad fault recovery after
a LIP reset although the driver in 2.4.19pre10aa4 seems okay
(have tested loop interruption under IO heavy load).

So, is possible for qlogic driver to be doing naughty things
with bufferheads? or is it more likely in the fs?
Anyone out there running a reasonably busy fileserver with
qlogic FC HBA and using ext3 or XFS with quotas? What
kernel/qlogic driver combo?
