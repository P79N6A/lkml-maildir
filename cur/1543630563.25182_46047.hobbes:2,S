The idea is that the IB interconnect is "trusted". Doing very low level kernel
operations cluster-style over a non-trusted link is asking for it; either you
lose security-wise or performance for authentication / encryption _will_ kill
you.
The real interesting question from my side is "availability"; how does the
kernel deal with crashed nodes, loss of link etc? If you already had agreed or
semi-standard interfaces here, we would gladly pick them up.
These generic cluster interfaces are being discussed as part of the Open
Clustering Framework now, and it would be good if a kernel developer reviewed
the discussions regarding the generic event mechanism proposed from a kernel
perspective.
Sincerely,
