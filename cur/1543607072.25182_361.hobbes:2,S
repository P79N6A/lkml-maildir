  I will probably try this patch, assuming it applies nicely to newer
kernels. But such an aggressive nice does have a downside as given, it
can result in a process in memory which doesn't get scheduled. Or one
which gets run only long enough to get the next page fault, and which
takes resources while never getting anything done.
  So this is useful, but I hope people won't consider this as a complete
colution. I still think we need a real idle process to do the low
priority task feature in the most useful way. I think this would not
provide good results in a system with significant memory pressure.

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
