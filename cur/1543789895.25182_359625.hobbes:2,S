This illustrates you fundamentally don't understand a lot of Linux, and 
SCSI too.
Several non-blkdev device classes (Christoph listed them) use block 
layer request_queue for command transit, as does SG_IO and /dev/sg.

I very clearly said I don't know the best answer.  Perhaps you need to 
re-read the quoted email?

I covered that in the quoted email.

We have plenty of specs.  It's called source code.
You don't understand the Linux development process (think its more 
political than technical) and you don't understand even what a block 
driver is, and you wonder why you have difficulty getting code into the 
kernel?
