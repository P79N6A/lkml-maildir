Ha. Just because I don't think I made you puke hard enough already with
foul approximations ... for order 2, I think it's
1-(1-(free_pool/total)^3)^free_pool 
because all 3 of his buddies have to be free as well.
(and generically ... 2^order - 1)
ORDER: 1
1024MB system, 8MB pool = 1.000000
131072MB system, 8MB pool = 0.117506
1024MB system, 128MB pool = 1.000000
131072MB system, 128MB pool = 1.000000
ORDER: 2
1024MB system, 8MB pool = 0.000976

------------------------
I really should learn not to post my rusty math in such public places ...
but I still think the point is correct. Anyway, I'm sure somewhere in
the resultant flamewar, someone will come up with some better approx ;-)
And yes, I appreciate the random distribution thing is wrong. But it's
still not going to work for bigger allocs. Fixing the free watermarks
will help us a bit though.
