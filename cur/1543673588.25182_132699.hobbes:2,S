See my other email.  Style is a personal issue.  I personally
think that trying to determine logical groupings by following a
jagged right column is much harder than following a formatted left
collumn.  In other words:
if ((*period == 0)
 || (syncrate->rate == NULL)
 || ((ahc->features & AHC_ULTRA2) != 0
  && (syncrate->sxfr_u2 == 0)))
Visually indicates the logical operator grouping, while this:
if ((*period == 0) ||
    (syncrate->rate == NULL) ||
    ((ahc->features & AHC_ULTRA2) != 0 &&
    (syncrate->sxfr_u2 == 0)))
Does not.
The driver is consistent in its use of this style.

Yes.

Actually, it overflows long and causes an error.  It must be promoted
to ULL.  Yes, this is a C99 thing, but this has been supported by GCC
for a very long time and much of the kernel already uses it.
> (4) constants describing the upper byte of the length are not used
In this function, no.  They are used elsewhere in the driver.  This
has been corrected in my patch.
> (5) return is a keyword, not a function
I'm fully aware of this.  You are again complaining about style.
> (6) uint32_t used instead of u32 (contrary to Linux conventions)
uint32_t is portable to any C99 compliant system.  u32 is not.  These
types were chosen to match those used by the driver core.  The driver
core must compile on systems other than Linux.
> (7) it's randomly panicking in a driver; at least complain in a comment
It's not random.  The case that it tests should never happen since Linux
claims that segments that cross a 4GB boundary will never be presented
to a PCI driver.

The driver does not bounce.  The reason you don't see this is because
Linux is not sending segments that cross a 4GB boundary.

This was obvious from code inspection.
