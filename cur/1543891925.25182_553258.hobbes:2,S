even if the waker runs at nice+19, under CFS (which schedules 
deterministically) it should not be delayed by a single nice-0 task by 
more than ~70 msecs. That is a far cry from the 'seconds' that Matt saw 
- and the sched stats he sent look anomalous too. Also, i'm not able to 
reproduce it at all - while any nice+19 related problem should be 
readily reproducable on my box too. So my current take is that this is 
some sort of host-side CFS related problem and that the lguest host 
threads somehow were the first ones that managed to trigger it in some 
really bad way.
OTOH i do agree with your patch, that nice+19 thing is quite hacky :-)
