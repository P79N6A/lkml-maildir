I've been running 2.3.13 successfully but, starting with 2.3.14-pre1 and
up to the present 2.3.14, my system has started to hang on boot-up.  I've
done a bit of tracking and found that if I omit ntp (v. 4.0.92f) from my
startup sequence, my system comes up normally.  Also, I am able to hit
SysRq-P while the system is hung, correlate EIP with the System.map and
observe that it seems stuck in the area of the scheduler.
HTH,
