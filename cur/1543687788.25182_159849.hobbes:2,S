Not displayed by "make menuconfig" and "make config" 
unfortunately.
I found the config variable CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT
on .config. So this is actually a problem with the config 
tools and not the available config variables...
What did you use that displayed the option? Or is there
some other option that hides the choice of log
buffer? I have a stock 2.4.6-test3 from kernel.org
