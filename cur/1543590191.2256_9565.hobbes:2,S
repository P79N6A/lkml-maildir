In an abstract theoretical sense yes. Accidentally almost impossible.

The only people are ever likely to do is to corrupt the CMOS, which is easily
cleared.

Sounds like a rather more physical layer problem - like a power spike and
PSU failure.
BTW: Always put a voltmeter on a power supply before you swap it like that
to test it. You need to check the voltages under load look sane otherwise you
may end up using a failed PSU to blow up other motherboards which is a
rather expensive debugging error ;)
