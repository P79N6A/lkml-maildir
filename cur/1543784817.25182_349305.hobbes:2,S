Does "everything" include someone doing
    git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/roland/whatever.git
How about http:// instead of rsync://?
In other words, is the git network transport smart enough to handle
the alternates path?
Or is the idea that everyone will clone your tree and then pull extra
stuff from other trees?
