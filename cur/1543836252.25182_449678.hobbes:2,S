Could I hassle you for a full API description?  I guess the actual
transport and data represenatation is covered by Shailabh's documents, but
it'd be valuable if you could prepare a Documentation file which describes
what the various fields mean and which explains when and how they are
accumulated and when they are delivered to userspace, etc.
Thanks.
