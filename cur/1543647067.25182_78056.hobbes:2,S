I have more of this cases.
I use a program called VDR. This is for recording digital-TV-program
from satallite.
After a recording is finished i cut the recordings. I my case i "stream"
the input-data via NFS from the recording machine(s) through a converter
into the local temporary directory. After i have enough files i create
ISO-images of the files. When i create an ISO-images i "stream" the
files from HDD1 to HDD2 because otherwise it would completly kill the
performance. Then i burn the ISO-Image onto a DVD-R.
Every single part in the whole process trashes the cache.
