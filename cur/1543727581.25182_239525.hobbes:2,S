Not many people want raw data, so the tool authors
will need to put out new releases anyway.
It doesn't take more than a week generally.

The overhead? I'm not seeing much, other than the multiple
files and the very fact that field locations are movable.
As long as I can fall back to the old /proc files when truly
radical kernel changes happen, exposure of kernel internals
isn't a serious problem.
If I had the DWARF2 data alone, /dev/mem might be enough.

I'll need to track down some netlink documentation.
Last time I looked, there wasn't any.

I don't think it does.
For the existing files though:
Some SE Linux policies block all access to /proc. Some security
feature patches zero out things that would reveal addresses.
(start_code, end_code, wchan...)
