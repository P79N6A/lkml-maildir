hm. I cannot see the source of the bug at the moment, but here's my 
analysis so far:
the last event that irqtrace got was #69, and that was a 'hardirqs on' 
in syscall_exit_work. After that we did a 'hardirqs off' without 
properly tracking that via irqtrace. Next time we got an irqtrace event 
(event 70) the assert caught up with us and turned off lockdep and 
backed out of that function. This was in:

isnt the refrigerator() suspend related? Perhaps suspend disables irqs 
somewhere that we forgot to track?
a new thread gets its hardirqs_enabled this way:
 #ifdef __ARCH_WANT_INTERRUPTS_ON_CTXSW
         p->hardirqs_enabled = 1;
 #else
         p->hardirqs_enabled = 0;
 #endif
on i386 __ARCH_WANT_INTERRUPTS_ON_CTXSW is off so it starts with 0. We 
set this up in copy_process() so there's no chance this task can run 
without this initialized.
