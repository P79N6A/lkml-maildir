Thanks for narrowing this down!

Hmmm. I'm not sure why the ACPI PM timer isn't showing up. Your .config
looks good, but I don't see the ACPI PM timer io-port being detected as
I expect.
Len, has there been any changes to that ACPI code?

I just got another report about the pit clocksource having trouble,
although that was on an SMP system. So its likely there is an issue
there so I'll have to hunt that down.

I need to dig on the ACPI issue, but I should be able to have a test
patch for you on the PIT issue early this week.
