Old code used to do:
	tmp = current->cpus_allowed;
	set_cpus_allowed(current, cpumask_of_cpu(cpu));
	function(arg);
	set_cpus_allowed(current, tmp);
We replaced it with:
	work_on_cpu(cpu, function, arg);
I thought I'd be clever and reliably check that the cpu they asked for
was online inside work_on_cpu.  Leading to locking problems.  But if they
didn't previously ensure cpu hotplug didn't happen, they were buggy already,
so I took out the check and hence the hotplug lock.
So we're no *worse* than we were before, but yes, an audit would probably
lead to fixes.
Hope that clarifies?
Rusty.
