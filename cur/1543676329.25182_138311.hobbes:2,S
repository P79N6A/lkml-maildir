Subject: 2.4.21-rc7-ac1: zip ppa 'device set offline...' problem in scsi_error.c?

Hi there,
My system is AMD K6-2/400 with IDE HD & CDROM with Redhat 9 
& updates installed.  
I'm trying to track down why zip-disk ppa driver doesn't want to 
work for me on 2.4.21-rc7-ac1, while working okay on 2.4.21-rc7.
The error is reported in response to the 'insmod ppa' command, 
afterwards, 'mount /mnt/zip' or 'fdisk /dev/sda' fail with '... 
/dev/sda4 is not a valid block device'.
Using 'echo "scsi log all" > /proc/scsi/scsi', both kernels 
scan IDs 0 thru 7 and find the zip drive on ID 6.  But the 
AC kernel then takes the zip drive offline.  
2.4.21-rc7-ac1 kernel taking zip ppa offline:

Attached are the full log sections in case the excerpts above 
don't give enough information.
Anybody shed some light on this?  I'm not sure what to try next.
Thanks,
Grant.
