Do you mean they wouldn't be listed in /proc/acpi/wakeup though?
Or just that they wouldn't be listed as PNP devices (like the button
devices)?  That seems buglike.  Not that BIOS bugs are so rare; and
I sure wouldn't know which types are common...
Because that example file certainly included UART and PS2 devices,
which were listed both as PNP devices and as ACPI devices.

Yeah, that's the idea.  Let's see if it's any good.  :)
I'd just call it "acpi_node" not "ACPI_node" (NO POINT IN SHOUTING),
and might not even use the "_node" suffix.
I cc'd Greg, who's our resident (or is that itinerant?) sysfs guru,
in case he has comments on this issue.
This applied over the "ACPI driver model flags and platform_enable_wake()"
patch with a bit of fuzz, on RC6.
