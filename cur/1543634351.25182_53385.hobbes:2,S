A spinlock deadlock causes the machine to be *totally* unresponsive (aka, 
no keyboard led changes and no pings) (at least, this is true of the scsi 
subsystem spinlocks).

Hmmm...the tape drive isn't listed in your output below.

It appears that you have the two hard drives connected to this 50 pin 
port.  That's not good.  The drives should be connected to the LVD port 
via a good LVD cable with LVD terminator, the CD-ROM should be on the 50 
pin port, and the tape (which I'm assuming is external and not a new LVD 
tape drive but an older narrow tape drive using a 50 pin connecter) should 
either be on the same cable as the CD-ROM (via an internal/external cable 
adapter) or on the 50pin port on the back of the card (but only if the 
port on the back of the card is not an LVD capable port, but is instead a 
SE port wired together with the internal 50 pin port).  Hooking them up 
the way you have them is asking for trouble because your high end disks 
are being forced to operate in a very degraded performance state.

See, disk 1 is being forced all the way fown to narrow, ultra speeds.

Same here, narrow ultra speeds.  Both of these disks should likely be 
running in wide ultra2 speeds or better (this second one might not do 
ultra2, I couldn't tell by the model number, but I suspect it does).

Async transfers (the cd-rom).  This should *not* be on the same cable as 
the disks.
