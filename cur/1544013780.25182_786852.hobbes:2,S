Especially when you are making pointless complaints about things that are
generally done the way the original code is - and for good reason. It
makes it far cleaner to add new ioctl support.
It would be interesting to see what mflash looked like as a libata driver
but I think for embedded systems the driver as submitted shows great
promise.
