  I've spent some time hunting bugs in UDF recently so I'll warn you a
bit :). Definitely rewriting that ... code would be a good thing to do
(reading that code I had urges to do it several times). The hard thing
is that there is no reasonable spec you could use - there are two
documents which define how UDF should look like but they are really hard
to read (they have like hundred pages each and one does not make sence
without the other). And reading the code and learning how the filesystem is
supposed to work isn't too helpful either. Just a friendly warning ;)
