Ummm...  probe_hwif() is a good example of the opposite - it can fail
past the point where it disables irq and that means no register_irq()
after enable_irq() call on cleanup.

How about
 
        action = NULL;
        if (!(status & (IRQ_DISABLED | IRQ_INPROGRESS))) {
                action = desc->action;
                status &= ~IRQ_PENDING; /* we commit to handling */
		if (likely(action))
			status |= IRQ_INPROGRESS; /* we are handling it */
        }
        desc->status = status;
in handle_irq()?

	See above - we shouldn't clear it on action == NULL, but we don't
need to set it, AFAICS.

ObOtherFun:  There's another bogosity in quoted ide-probe.c code, according
to dwmw2 - he says that there are PCI IDE cards that get IRQ 0, so the
test for hwif->irq is b0rken.  We probably should stop overloading
->irq == 0 for "none given", but I'm not sure that we *have* a value
that would never be used as an IRQ number on all platforms...
