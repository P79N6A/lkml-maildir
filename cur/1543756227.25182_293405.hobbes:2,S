FWIW, there are two limitations of libata in this area:
1) ISTR some PATA vendor-specific commands have a very specific set of 
input and output registers to use, and input/output sets of registers 
may differ from each other.
2) libata is lazy, and just reads registers in "groups":  the 
lbaH/M/L/nsect registers, the device register, etc.
