Seems odd that you didn't get it in previous versions ... ? But 
running the NMI oops detection whilst stealing NMIs in order to
bootstrap the CPUs is probably a Bad Idea (tm).

Well, you don't want to send an NMI to yourself (the BSP), I presume?
That would probably make it unhappy ;-) The NMIs have to be logically addressed, which precludes the allbutself thingy, IIRC. So you have
a choice of serialised unicast (which is probably quite fast enough)
or cluster at a time, being careful to exclude yourself when you do
the BSP's cluster. 
But I think you'd be far better off just disabling the NMI oopser
until we've booted - the dual use is too much nefarious incest for
my liking.
