It's a problem of not enough synchronisation before a module load completes.
If a module provides an interface, but needs some time after being load to
initialize, it obviously MUST provide a way to wait for it. Since you'll
need some i-need-module-foo functions anyway, why not: (bar needs foo)
-foo.c---
DECLARE_COMPLETION(init_complete); /* static? */
module_foo_init_async() {
        ...
        void complete_all(&init_complete);
}
void usemod_foo()
{
        wait_for_completion(&init_complete);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(usemod_foo)
-bar.c---
DECLARE_COMPLETION(init_complete);
module_bar_init_async() {
        usemod_foo();
        ...
        void complete_all(&init_complete);
}
void usemod_bar()
{
        wait_for_completion(&init_complete);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(usemod_bar)
