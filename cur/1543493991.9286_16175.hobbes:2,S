Could someone please reply to ME @ brooks@causenfx.org (or cc) and let me
know what some of the following errors mean:
Apr 22 09:54:09 sf -- MARK --
Apr 22 09:56:31 sf kernel: svc: server socket destroy delayed
Apr 22 10:02:09 sf inetd[14162]: getpwnam: sys: No such user
Apr 22 04:03:36 sf PAM_pwdb[13357]: (su) session opened for user nobody by
(uid=99)
My syslogd suddently has not been running since apr 22.  I suspect someone
has hacked my system but am not sure yet.  Can you kindly please help me
out and try to figure out what all those mean?
Best Reguards..
