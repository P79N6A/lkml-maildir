Problem in a nutshell:  The module for my soundcard (cs4232.o) won't
load until after a "cat /proc/isapnp" has been run.  I'm guessing
(though not sure) that this isn't the intended behavior.  ISAPnP is
compiled into the kernel, and detects the card correctly during boot, as
evidenced by the boot messages.  Doesn't seem like a huge deal, any idea
where the problem lies?
