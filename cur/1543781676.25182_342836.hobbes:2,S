I'd rather not.  The problem is that we have a host (thanks Intel)
which is unable to report how many bytes were transferred before an
error occurs.  My fear is that doing anything other than sector by
sector write will lead to corruption should an error occur.
However, I've no way to induce such an error, so I can only base
this on theory.
It may work perfectly for the case when everything's operating
correctly, but I suspect if you're going to do multi-sector writes,
it'll all fall apart on the first error, especially on this host.
