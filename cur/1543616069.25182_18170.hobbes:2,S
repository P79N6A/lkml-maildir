Hi all
I've sent this before, but as far as I can see, nothing's changed.
I'm having problems reading multiple large files at once. Reading 100 1GB
files at once.
What happens is, when the buffer cache gets filled up, it all stalls, and
transfer speed drops from 40-50 MB/s to a mere 2MB/s.
This has been tested on all versions from 2.4.16-2.4.18-pre1.
I've been testing Tux, Khttpd, apache 1.3.22, Apache 2, thttpd, cp and
dd to verify the bug.
Please help!
