"Live without it once it's gone..."  Do you mean once the object is gone 
or once the module is gone?  The core in general has no way to know when 
the module is gone; all it knows about is the object.  The trouble arises 
when the module is gone (whether the core knows it or not) but the object 
is still present.

The example is fine as far as it goes, but it assumes that all
interactions with the underlying r->foo object can be done under a
spinlock.  Of course this isn't true in general.
