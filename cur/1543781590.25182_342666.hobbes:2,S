Maybe Ingo's priorities are sufficiently different that he thinks the
return _will_ be worthwhile.  We've already mentioned the work involved in
auditing all the USB drivers.  You bring up the point that the HCDs may
need adjustments also.

I'm in favor of #2 on general principle.  The issue you mention,
maintaining bandwidth reservations (and hardware data structures) for
periodic endpoint queues, is not all that difficult to handle.  Are there
any other parts of the HCDs you can think of that would be affected by
such a change?  (I can't think of any for uhci-hcd, although I haven't
looked through the code to make sure.)
