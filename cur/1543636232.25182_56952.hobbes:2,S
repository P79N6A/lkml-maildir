Oh, I see. But that would mean adding yet another lock to an existing 
locking scheme? So both i_sem and the "per file lock" would nead to be held 
over readdir(). That's doable but it would have to be a semaphore based 
lock due to readdir()...
Perhaps the f_lock from your patch, changed to a semaphore, and acquiring 
it in generic_file_llseek&friends, vfs_readdir() (and any other place where 
f_pos needs protecting) would be able to do the trick. Would that solve the 
lock contention problems you were seing? It would at least off-load i_sem a 
bit... but it would only replace one semaphore for another...

Hm, true. I hadn't read it for quite a while...
