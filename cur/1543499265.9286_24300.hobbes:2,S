   After all, I have "just" 8 GB disk where egcs compile happens,
   0.5 GB RAM, and 0.25 GB swap.  (Alpha 21164A/433 MHz)
Alpha tends to obtain instability every few releases, just by chance
are you using an Adaptec scsi controller?  I note also that just last
week some Compaq engineer noted on this list that he was tracking down
similar problems (in fact lockups, when using ISP1000 SCSI) during
some benchmark runs.
Later,
