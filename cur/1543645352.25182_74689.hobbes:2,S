I am running your program now over an hour without any corruption on the 
loopback mounted ext3 filesystem.
This is with the latest patch (1) from Theodore + latest small fix from 
Christoper for the kernel and for latest e2fsprogs.
I made some debian packages available which includes the latest fixes, can be 
found here (2).
Anyway, works great for me! :)
