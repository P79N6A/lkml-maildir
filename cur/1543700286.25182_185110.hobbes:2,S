I suspect this should be fixable with just a simple mempool.
Opportunistic allocation of encrypt-and-IO buffers to keep
performance decent when there's lots of memory available,
fallback to the mempool when free memory is low.
In real emergencies the IO completion code could probably
free the encrypt-and-IO buffer into the mempool.
