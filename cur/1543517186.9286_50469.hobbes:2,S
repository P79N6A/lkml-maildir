Basically, any sort of IDE activity interferes with the serial port.  If
I access anything on either IDE port while doing anything with the hard
disk, characters get lost or corrupted.
I've tried just about everything to get rid of it.  Both 2.2.10 and
2.2.13 do it.  It doesn't matter whether I use UDMA (M14xx) or not. 
Both serial ports are affected.  And it's not a hardware fault because
two identical mobo's have shown this problem.
Mick.
