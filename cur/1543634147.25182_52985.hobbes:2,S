Heh?  Yielding is not about being nice, if you want to be nice you
lower your priority.  Yielding is telling the scheduler "I am
temporarily out of things to do, maybe for a while, but a least until
all the others running threads got a chance to run too".  Any
scheduler that runs you immediatly again without running the others
threads is _broken_.
