afacit it's already working.  The level of merge and build errors in the
subsystem trees this time around is a tiny fraction of what it was at the
same stage in 2.6.24-rcX.  otoh perhaps this is because Ingo got tired of
all the complaining and took most of his tree away from me, dunno ;)

There are 60 or 80 "susbsytem" trees hosted in -mm at present:
...
# spi
# mfd
# vt
# kprobes
# quota
# i4l
# i2o
# ecryptfs
# autofs
# rtc
# gpio
# fbdev
# md
# pnp
# ext2
# ext3
# ufs
# udf
# reiserfs
# fat
# documentation
# cgroups
# memcgroup
# cpusets
# signals
# pgrp
# ptrace
# workqueues
# cpu hotplug
# kdump
# dma
# ipc
# ipmi
# tty
# elf
# char
# keys
<etc>
I need to find a way to a) get matureish parts of those trees into
linux-next and to b) base the rest of -mm off linux-next.  I haven't
started thinking about that yet.
There seem to be some trees which aren't yet in linux-next, some of them
significant.  The present list I'm pulling from is

which ones are missing?
Do we know if many people are testing linux-next yet?
I had planned on asking patch contributors to base their work on linux-next
when the 2.6.23- and 2.6.24-style calamities reoccurred.  But it just
hasn't happened.
