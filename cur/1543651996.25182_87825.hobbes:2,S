Thanks, this is good information. Was the destination for the 'dd' and
the source CD image on the same drive? What filesystem were you using? 
I notice you used a 4x writer...I'll try lowering my write speed to 4x
and see if that makes a difference. I'll also see if I can rig up an
IDE disk instead of SCSI.
