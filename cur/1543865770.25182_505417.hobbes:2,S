Try it. It's not what it does. 
If you have a 
	depends on SCSI
and you did not say you wanted SCSI, you'll never even *see* the question.
It will *not* turn on SCSI automatically for you. Quite the reverse. It 
will not even show you the option.
In contrast, it you do a
	select SCSI
you'll see the question, and it will do exactly what you claim "depends 
on" does. Which yes, is what we want.
So what's your problem? You argue as if you didn't understand the 
difference between "depends on" and "select".
As an example of this, look at SATA. It does "select SCSI" if you select 
CONFIG_ATA, _exactly_ because it actually wants to turn on the SCSI layer 
*regardless* of what the user said. Because if the user said "n" to SCSI, 
the user simply didn't know that the SATA code uses the SCSI code.
Which is an example of what I've been saying all along: "select" makes 
sense. USB_STORAGE should have done the same.
Claiming that "select" is evil is just totally strange.
