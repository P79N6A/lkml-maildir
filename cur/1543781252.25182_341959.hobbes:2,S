Since I never encountered it, I'm not versed in the switching of
the current altsetting. I suppose, this has to be discussed between
digikam developers and linux-usb-devel (Alan Stern probably knows
how that has to be done). It's very likely that all digikam needs
is to claim the interface after the altsetting was switched...
But I really do not know.
