My patch which was included in 2.2 seems to be missing from 2.4.1.
The idea was taken from trident.c, and it keeps xmms at normal CPU
usage. Same patch against 2.4.1 would look like this, but it's
totally untested:

Also I'll have to ask you to please go and play some mirrormagic as
you promised when I sent the 2.2-patch. ;-)
As of 2.2.18 the sound in most games still sounds like crap on my
82443MX-100-based laptop with the i810_audio driver, while alsa works
quite nicely.
