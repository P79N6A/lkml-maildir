10 controllers if you have the IDE patches applied.  4 otherwise.

in your lilo.conf, add a line:
append="ide4=0x168,0x36e,10"
See /usr/src/linux/Documentation/ide.txt for more info.  You may need to
specify the I/O ports for ide2 and ide3 in this case, as the above I/O
ports are for ide3.

If you have a reasonably recent /dev/MAKEDEV installed, you should be able
to just do "cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV hdi hdj hdk hdl", but failing that,
hdi = 56,0
hdj = 56,64
hdk = 57,0
hdl = 57,64
You can always check /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt for more.
Cheers, Andreas
