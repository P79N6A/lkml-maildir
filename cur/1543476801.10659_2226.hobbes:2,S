I can confirm that this builds and runs without any problems on
2.2.0-pre6-ac1.

Request that you change the /etc/pcmcia/serial on how it handles cua
devices.  I always have to make the following change because even with
2.2 kernels the cua devices still exist.
# Newer kernels do not have "cua" devices
#if [ -c /dev/cua1 ] ; then
#    NR=`expr $MINOR - 64`
#    DIALOUT=cua$NR
#else
#    DIALOUT=$DEVICE
#fi
DIALOUT=$DEVICE
