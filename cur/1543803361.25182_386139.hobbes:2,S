I'm not sure the old API is that important. This isn't something
programs (third party, kernel utils don't count) rely on. Most users
would switch to the new stack immediately anyway.
It could probably be a separate compatibility module, the core stack
probably don't have to know about it. The last to worry about I'd say.
