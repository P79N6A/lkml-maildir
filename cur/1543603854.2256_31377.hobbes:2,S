If anyone else is having problems with preemption on SMP, George
Anzinger of MontaVista has a solution in the newest preemptible kernel
patch that may solve it.
I am interested if anyone (a) has crashes with SMP and preemption and
(b) if this solves it.
Updated patches for 2.4.10, 2.4.11-pre4, and 2.4.10-ac7 are at
