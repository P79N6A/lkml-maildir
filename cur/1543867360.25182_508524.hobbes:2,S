I have I/O errors with Transcend SD highspeed card 2GB/150x when it's
mounted in r/w mode (cardreader on sharp sl-c1000)
It works well  if I reverse mmcv4 patch commited to 2.6.19-git2

)
I'm not experienced in mmc, but I figured out that problem is
somewhere in mmc_read_switch_caps() and when i change cmd.arg value
from 0x80FFFFF1 to 0x00FFFFF1 it works fine too
What argument should have SD_SWITCH opcode?
