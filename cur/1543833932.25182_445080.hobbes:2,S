Hello folks
I am attaching source files containing a very generic implementation
of B-trees in C. The implementation corresponds to in memory B-Tree
data structure. The B-tree library consists of two files, btree.h and
btree.c. I am also attaching a sample program main.c which should
hopefully make the use of the library clear.
I would be happy to receive inputs from the community for changes
(enchancements) to the library. All the more I would like to help
someone with a project which would take advantage of the B-Tree
implementation.
