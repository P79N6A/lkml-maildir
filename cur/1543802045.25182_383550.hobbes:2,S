I agree that it is useful to know about strange failures, however I still maintain
that _if_ the module is intended as a regression test for developers, than the
excessive (?) output is fair. I think that the most logical course of action is to
have a verbosity module paramter which defaults to displaying errors only, but it still
allows developers to get all the information they need.
