You didn't need to.  I had already seen the same results that you saw.

Doesn't work for me.  insmod (from ver. 0.9.11a module-init-tools)
won't load multiple copies of dummy[n].o or dummy[n].ko.
(with dummy already loaded)
For the .o files, it says:
  dummy: no version magic, tainting kernel.
  Error inserting 'dummy1.o': -1 File exists
and for the .ko files, it says:
  Error inserting 'dummy1.ko': -1 File exists
