Subject: [PATCH 2.6.2-rc3-mm1] DIO read race fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have found (finally) the problem causing DIO reads racing with
buffered writes to see uninitialized data on ext3 file systems 
(which is what I have been testing on).
The problem is caused by the changes to __block_write_page_full()
and a race with journaling:
journal_commit_transaction() -> ll_rw_block() -> submit_bh()
ll_rw_block() locks the buffer, clears buffer dirty and calls
submit_bh()
A racing __block_write_full_page() (from ext3_ordered_writepage())
	would see that buffer_dirty() is not set because the i/o
        is still in flight, so it would not do a bh_submit()
	It would SetPageWriteback() and unlock_page() and then
	see that no i/o was submitted and call end_page_writeback()
	(with the i/o still in flight).
This would allow the DIO code to issue the DIO read while buffer writes
are still in flight.  The i/o can be reordered by i/o scheduling and
the DIO can complete BEFORE the writebacks complete.  Thus the DIO
sees the old uninitialized data.
Here is a quick hack that fixes it, but I am not sure if this the
proper long term fix.
Thoughts?
Daniel
