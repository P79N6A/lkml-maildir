Sorry: I meant "cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc -checkdrive" returns correct
"supported modes".
I was wrong, however: it is still broken.  Sometimes it will return
version 2/format 2 results time after time (with supported modes), but
then I leave it for a while and it reverts to returning 0/1 results with
no supported modes.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason about
it: the "put a disc in and it works" trick doesn't work any more.
This is with 2.5.64-mm8.  What other details would help?  strace output
of cdrecord?
