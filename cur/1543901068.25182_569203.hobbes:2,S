by the way, a data point on kernel sizes
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  864648 Jul 14 00:53 vmlinuz.2.6.22.1.hibernate
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  659496 Jul 14 01:17 vmlinuz.2.6.22.1.hibernate.stripped
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3948168 Jul 14 01:10 vmlinuz.2.6.22.1.running
the running one matches the config I'm running on my home server, the 
hibernate is a pretty stripped down version, and the stripped is close to 
a minimum (including turning off printk and BUG()). All three are with all 
drivers built-in, no module support.
this is on a amd64 64 bit system
configs are available if anyone cares, the point is how much smaller a 
kernel could be if it doesn't need all the stuff that you put in your main 
kernel. In my case this includes not enabling the 3-ware card that holds 
my 12-disk raid array, instead the hibernate image would be stored on one 
of the scsi drives attached to the adaptec 78xx card.
I expect that on a normal desktop/laptop with more features (like sound) 
the savings could be even more significant
