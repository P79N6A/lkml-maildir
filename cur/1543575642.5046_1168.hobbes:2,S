This is fine providing the code is aware of the potential race. You capture
all the CPUs up the count by one, set the new cpu going and wait for it
to jump to being captured (even though not by an interrupt) ?

The other approach would be too make sure the per CPU structures allocated
which consume little memory have space already for the extra processors - eg
with the arrays of pointers etc
