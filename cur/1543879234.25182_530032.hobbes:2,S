Thanks for the explanations !
That's the kind of solution i did use. But it seems I achieved to add
the md/linear array to the md/raid1 after lvm was enabled, I only have
to not to use an initrd.
the kernel I'm using at the moment is a 2.6.18-4-vserver-xen (debian
one) plus the following patches:
- dm-io-fix-bi_max_vecs.patch
- dm-merge-max_hw_sector.patch
also i'm using #define RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE PAGE_SIZE rather than
(64*1024) in raid1.c.
Not sure if that could explain the fact i was able to add the md/linear
array to the md/raid1 after enabling lvm. (still i had not to use an
initrd)
When I have more time I'll try to reproduce this on a test machine.

Ok, i'd be curious to test them (if they're usable and publicly
available)

Thanks. (at least i understand(-ish) what's going on) ;-)
