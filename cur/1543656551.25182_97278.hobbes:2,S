this is not correct. the assumed target (of a _far_ call) would issue a far 
return and only an offset would be left on the stack to return to (oops). the 
code segment of the orginal caller needs pushed to create the seg:off pair and 
hence a far return would land back at the original calling routine. this is a 
very convoluted method of making the orginal call being far, as simply calling 
far in the first pace should issue much faster. OTOH, if you are making a 
workaround to an already existing piece of code, this works beautifully (with 
the additional seg pushed on the stack).
