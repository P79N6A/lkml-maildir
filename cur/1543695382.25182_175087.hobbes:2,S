I think the section entitled "Laptops" is overly optimistic.  First,
as far as i know, suspend-to-disk has only this week been announced
(on this mailing list) for anything other than the i386 platform, and
even there, many laptops only marginally work with software suspend/
suspend-to-disk.  I really doubt that any file system utilizing USB or
ieee1394 is going to work reliably (if at all) with suspend for many
laptops in the near future.  I think the 2.6.0 shakedown and the amount
of attention (or lack thereof) given to suspend-related bugs makes it
clear that suspend-to-disk/software suspend is still experimental in
this release.
I sincerely hope that changes very soon and i will do what i can to 
help.  Meanwhile, please qualify that section to read:
   ... now supports full software-suspend-to-disk functionality on many
								-------
   laptops for the Linux user on the go.
   -------				  [emphasis to show added text]
It's definitely improved, but in many instances (especially where the 
laptop manufacturer has not provided full hardware/BIOS documentation),
it does not work well and may be difficult to make reliable in the near
future.
Respectfully submitted,
