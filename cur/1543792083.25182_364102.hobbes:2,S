Yes, for system-wide operations.  No - for cpuset-relative operations.
For task migration (Christoph Lameter's patches) to work, I need to
provide a safe way for jobs to manage placement within their assigned
cpuset.  This means providing wrappers to sched_setaffinity, mbind and
set_mempolicy that take cpuset-relative cpu/mem numbers, and provide a
robust, cpuset-relative API to applications, that hides any migrations
from the application.
A year ago, Simon Derr pushed hard to get cpuset-relative numbering
support into the kernel, anticipating these sorts of problems.  I and
others pushed back, saying that this was the work of libraries, and
that the kernel-user API needed to use one simple, system-wide numbering.
Enforcing a system-wide synchronization of library code, using just
user code, is expensive, difficult and scales poorly on large systems.
A trivial, code-wise, hook in the kernel will enable each independent
library routine to efficiently detect any parallel changes and redo
their operation sequence.  It enables providing applications with a
cpuset-relative API for internal job memory and cpu placement that is
efficient and robustly safe in the face of migrations.
