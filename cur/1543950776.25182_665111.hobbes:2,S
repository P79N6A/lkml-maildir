iirc, patches like this have been submitted more than once.
i remember i have seen one floating around years ago.
aside from the fact that using partitions on loop devices is useful - if 
we had dm-loop (
http://sources.redhat.com/lvm2/wiki/DMLoop
) in mainline - 
would using kpartx with that also mean stacking 2 layers of block device ?
personally, i like the kpartx approach. afaik, it`s working good.
i also like dm-loop, because i think that mapping of files to blockdevices 
belongs into an appropriate subsystem like device-mapper.
maybe some of the dm folks know better or have some real arguments - so i`m 
adding bryn reeves here. (just noticed that dm-loop disappeared from -mm due 
to removal of some api change - so it`s a good chance to bring it back into 
discussion) ;)
regards
roland
