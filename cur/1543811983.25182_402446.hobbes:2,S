Again, good points.  Ever have one of those days?  Take 2.
Commit 827c1a6c1a5dcb2902fecfb648f9af6a532934eb introduced a new
function that calls eeh_add_device_late() implicitly.  This patch
reorders the two functions in question to fix the compile error.  This
might be preferable to exposing eeh_add_device_late() in eeh.h.
Thanks-
John
