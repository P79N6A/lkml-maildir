Actually, I think dma_mask and consistent memory are orthogonal problems.  
dma_masks are used by the I/O subsystem to determine whether direct DMA to a 
memory region containing an I/O buffer is possible or whether it has to be 
bounced.  Consistent memory is usually allocated for driver specific 
transfers.  The I/O subsystem doesn't usually require the actual I/O buffers 
to be in consistent memory.
