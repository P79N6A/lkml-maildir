     If you want to guinea pig it for me, there's a patch to the
     memory detect code at 
http://www.pell.chi.il.us/~orc/Memory
     {new.new.mem-2.2.1 or somesuch};   I'm in the throes of
     testing that it works with all the systems I have, and will
     build up a system that's capable of compiling 2.2.x soon so I can
     release a patch for Linus to integrate.
