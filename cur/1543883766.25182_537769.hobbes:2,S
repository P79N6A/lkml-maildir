... and it gets better: I've been trying to fix/improve stuff I can, with
my limited abilities as coder for some time now in the linux kernel, but there
are simply cases where, although you're trying to even come up with a proper fix
and adhere to all the kernel coding standards and _even_ produce a patch which
can serve as rough cut for a probable fix, your mail simply disappears into the
void unanswered. Then you send again, and again, yet it remains unreplied and then you
give up and turn to something else. Some of those patches, for example, were the
rework of the debugging scheme of libata i did more than a year ago which got
reviewed and then .. forgotten, some kernel janitor cleanups, etc...
