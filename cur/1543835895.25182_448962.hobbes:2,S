Hi, 
I had some faith in this patch , but this just enable boot parameter
notsc (which I already use). And "just" disable tsc don't solve all the
problems. 
After "Using ACPI (MADT) for SMP configuration information"
my acpi_fadt.length is great than  0
acpi_fadt.plvl3_lat is 1001
On BIOS 1.40 update description of ASRock, claims this VIA chipset have
C1 stepping support.
this is a Pentium Dual Core on a 775Dual-880Pro
