Sure, I didn't expect the patch was general but it was enough to make
things work on the platform I'm currently trying to port to, and it
illustrated the problem I was hitting.

I just happened to have EHCI compiled in and put a USB 2 card into the
board.  The problem meant that the EHCI initialisation wouldn't even
complete, so I waded in to find out why.
IIRC, if I plug a USB2 device into a USB2 card but don't have the EHCI
driver active, the device is just ignored, rather than falling back to
using USB1.1 through OHCI?  We certainly have some USB2 devices we'd
like to use, even if the USB2 bandwidth might be throttled back by the
bounce buffering overhead.

I'll dig that out, if it's simple enough to backport I'll see if I can
take a stab at it.

That seems like the right approach.
