Subject: PROBLEM: kernel 2.2.1 hangs when mounting ZIP

I checked the archives of last month and didn't find this bug reported,
so...
I have a 2.2.1 kernel, Debian 2 distr. and a parport ZIP drive (EPP 16
bit).
I use KDE 1.1 and clicked the zip-disk icon with the right mouse button
and
selected 'mount' to mount the disk. At the same time I decided I
actually
wanted to open the disk and after releasing the right mouse button
clicked
the left button on the icon. The result: two popups telling me they
were trying to mount /dev/sda4 and a total lockup (not even the mouse
moved,
no console switching etc.)
I have not repeated this experiment again. I am not a sadist.
I suspect the two mount commands ruled deadlocked one another...
