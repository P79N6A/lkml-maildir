I think Ingo is right in saying what we really need first is a generic 
mechanism in how to specify static markers in the kernel which can be 
used to put dynamic probes on demand or use as a real static function 
calls if one chooses. Once we agree on the marker mechanism dynamic 
tracing and static tracing can both co-exist happily.
Coming to your rest of the patches i really don't think we need whole 
lot more than the facilities we already got in the kernel. Frank has 
successfully demonstrated in OLS how one can use static markers by using 
only existing facilities in the kernel.
