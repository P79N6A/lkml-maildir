Because doing it with BitTorrent is a nightmare.  I posted a long list
of the problems with BT for doing this to the BT mailing list and
pretty much got told that there is no way to do what I'd want to do
within BT.
Some of the people from the BT list have approached me about creating
a new protocol - working name "Software Distribution Protocol"
(SDP)... but it's a big job.
