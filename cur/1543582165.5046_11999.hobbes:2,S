Files that export symbols must have unique names.  Which is why we have
abominations like this.
fs/msdos/msdosfs_syms.c
fs/proc/procfs_syms.c
fs/fat/fatfs_syms.c
fs/vfat/vfatfs_syms.c
fs/lockd/lockd_syms.c
kernel/ksyms.c
net/netsyms.c
net/sunrpc/sunrpc_syms.c
net/irda/irsyms.c
Module symbol versions is being completely redesigned for 2.5 and will
not have this problem.  In the meantime create a unique filename for
anything that exports symbols.
