Odd..
I just tried out cachefs (for the first time) on Solaris2.6.
I mounted my home directory (which has 125 entries) and did 
 ls -F
while watching network traffic.
Except of the first time, and after every 30 seconds (the default
attribute cache timeout) there was only 1 RPC request for each
  ls -F
and that was to check the modify time on the directory.
But then that is exactly the same traffic that I see when I do
  ls -F
in my home directory over normal NFS (v2).
I could do 100 "ls -F" runns in about 4 seconds.
This is on regular 100Mbit ethernet.
