I'll be happy to look into whether this duplication can be removed, and also 
whether the bio_set stuff could be moved out to bio.c or somewhere else 
common to the other device-drivers and filesystems. However, I've got a lot 
of stuff going on right now, so I won't really have time to get to this until 
after the start of the year (might be able to start looking into it over the 
holidays if I get everything else done in the next couple weeks). If/When I 
come up with some patches, I'll let you know.
