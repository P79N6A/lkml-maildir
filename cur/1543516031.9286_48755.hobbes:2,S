  Other than a rude message from Alexander Viro telling someone to
patch it themselves or shut up (my words, not his), I haven't seen any
fixes for that one.  I was broken after 2.3.22, FYI.
  The change to init/main.c after 2.3.22 seems to have been to get rid
of the memory-awareness in that code.  Someone added a comment that I
haven't noticed until now...

  The only time I ever want to use IDE disks is when I have to reboot a
lot to test boot options.  Bah.
