I would like to push a kernel thread into a user-level process through
the use of execve. The kernel thread is started from a loadable 
module - so there has been no user-level process dipping into the 
kernel that we could just replace. 
The process init does something similar. From what I've been reading it
just calls execve() and magically it is a user-level process. Since 
my code does not generate a user-level process I assume there is more
to it than that. Can someone point me in the right direction to 
accomplishing this? Do I need to generate a user-land stack frame? How?
Please cc jhollingsworth@elon.edu as I'm currently not subscribed.
Thanks for reading.
