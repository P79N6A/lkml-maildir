Well, I certainly don't want to _remove_ the "inline" like your patch did. 
Other gcc versions will care. But I committed the pure "change to 
unsigned" part.
But we should fix the cmpxchg (and perhaps plain xchg too), shouldn't we?
That your gcc version gets it right doesn't change the fact that Chris' 
gcc version didn't, and out-of-lined it all. So we'll need some 
__always_inlines there too..
And no, I don't think it makes any sense to call them "__asm_inline". Even 
when there are asms hidden in between the C statements, what's the 
difference between "always" and "asm"? None, really.
