The problem is that it is hard to distingush Core2 based Xeons
from P4 based Xeons.
There won't be any new Pentium 4 cores so that list should be static.
But yes the C2 list is a little problematic. Will remove that
and just say "family 6" 
Perhaps we should just bit the bullet and add a "optimize for current 
CPU" option.

Prescott; the Intel codename for their first x86-64 core.
Rhymes with K8 which was AMD's codename for the same.
Admittedly MCORE2 doesn't fit the pattern, it should have 
been MMEROM. But then when the C2 support was implemented
the Marketing name was already known, which wasn't the case
with the others.
