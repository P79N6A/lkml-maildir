Well I am one APIC victim since Jan 2002. almost 2 years.
I suggested build one database of "APIC victims" 
"Hi I would like make a database of the computers that have to Turning
off APIC.  Model, mother board and chip set, processor type ,  and DSDT
signature.
And put in blacklist.c to give this exactly warning."
But what I would like to say here is: I try to understand where kernel
hangs when I enable APIC and doesn't hangs when IRQ routing is setting,
but hangs before, exactly when try to:
"evxfevnt-0093 [04] acpi_enable           : Transition to ACPI mode
successful." this message never appears.
PS: I just don't had begging  the database because, now,  I don't have
any time for that. But I had some ideas, like using  php to upload dsdt
bin and try automatically Disassemble AML to ASL using iasl as cgi etc. 
thanks
