No, you're confused on inter_module. inter_module_* allows 2 or more
modules to share data. The danger is that one module may disappear
while the other is still accessing the data.
In this case, there is absolutely no data sharing. One module can
safely unload without affecting the other. The only danger is
that one might be in a midst of a calling the callout function while
the other is unregistering its notifier block. But then the notifier
chain already protects this from happening.

No, there's no need to do this. It just adds more complexity to
the already complicated dependency.
