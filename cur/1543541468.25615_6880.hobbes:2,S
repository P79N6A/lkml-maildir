Hi Greg,
Your patch has a problem with the location of the $(CC) test.
In the top Makefile, $(CC) isn't usable until after the to Makefile
includes arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile.  This is because the arch Makefile
can change the value of $(CROSS_COMPILE), which affects the value
of $(CC).
Look at the location of the "-fno-strict-aliasing' test.  That's
where your test needs to be.
I have some documentation on the kernel Makefiles:
