Stupid idea, we need something to control policy, this isn't going in
the kernel, it can be a lot smaller than X and auditable.. sticking
the DRI protocol in the kernel is just pointless..

I'm hoping to look into this but it is a parallel problem to what this
code does, the VT switch API sucks rocks, so providing something
compatible is going to suck rocks..

This just needs a userspace console again a parallel problem that
really isn't much to do with the problem set this work is trying to
solve... it should enable it...

No problems.
