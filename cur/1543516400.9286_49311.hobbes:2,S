It does, but not as much as you'd think given the noise.
The two main problems with inode write performance:
  - They're done in no good order.  Hence extra seeks.
  - They're done at the same time as your carefully optimised read
    order.  Hence they screw it up.
  - The dirty inodes take up memory which could be used for other inodes..

Directory access times are updated because you're reading the
directories.  That's normal and POSIX.  Mount with `nodiratime' if you
don't like it.
