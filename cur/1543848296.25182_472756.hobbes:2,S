NAK.  What happens to the ports if pci_enable_device() fails and someone
has them open?
It's far better to leave the must_check warning behind until it can be
_correctly_ solved, rather than papering over the problem with bogus
patches to return errors without taking an appropriate additional action.
IOW, the warnings serve as a reminder that *proper* error handling needs
to be implemented.
