Bleh. Except for storage, base 1024 was used for almost everything
I remember. 4 MB memory meant 4096 KB, and that's still the case today.
Most likely the same for transfer rates.
It's just that storage vendors broke the computer rule and went with 1000.
Just teach all the exceptions. No life is without.
