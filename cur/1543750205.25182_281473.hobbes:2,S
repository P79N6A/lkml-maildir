Doesn't the NVidia driver use their own version of DRM/DRI ?
If so, then did you tell it to use the Linux kernel versions of that
driver ?

I was just having a discussion about this last night with a friend
of mine and I'm going to pose this question to you and others.
Is a real-time enabled kernel still relevant for high performance
video even with GPUs being as fast as they are these days ?
The context that I'm working with is that I was told (been out of
gaming for a long time now) that GPus are so fast these days that
shortage of frame rate isn't a problem any more. An RTOS would be
able to deliver a data/instructions to the GPU under a much tighter
time period and could delivery better, more consistent frame rates.
Does this assertion still apply or not ? why ? (for either answer)
