Getting better, but still not right:
make -f /home/rmk/bk/linux-2.6-rmk/scripts/Makefile.build obj=include/asm-arm
  SYMLINK include/asm-arm/arch -> include/asm-arm/arch-rpc
mkdir -p include/asm-arm
ln -fsn /home/rmk/bk/linux-2.6-rmk/include/asm-arm/arch-rpc include/asm-arm/arch

  CHK     include/asm-arm/constants.h
  UPD     include/asm-arm/constants.h
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `include/asm-arm/include/asm-arm/.arch', needed by `__build'.  Stop.

make: *** [_all] Error 2
Removing "include/asm-arm/" from the always := line in asm-arm/Kbuild
appears to fix this.
