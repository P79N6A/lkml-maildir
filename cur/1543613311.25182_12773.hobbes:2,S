Hey, i managed to isolate the problem. It's a conflict with the PPP 
Deflate option.
I don't think that (from what I read from the help) that this option is 
so importanto, but notheless, i think this is a bug with the TUX's 
patches. My guess is that just changing the struct names that conflict 
would solve the problem. I might even try to do it myself if no one else 
does until the weekend.
Thanks for the help,
Paulo S.
