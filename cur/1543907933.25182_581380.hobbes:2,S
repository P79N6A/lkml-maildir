+General note on [U]EFI x86_64 support
+-------------------------------------
+
+The nomenclature EFI and UEFI are used interchangeably in this document.
+
+Although the tools below are _not_ needed for building the kernel,
+the needed bootloader support and associated tools for x86_64 platforms
+with EFI firmware and specifications are listed below.
+
+1. UEFI specification:  
http://www.uefi.org
+
+2. Booting Linux kernel on UEFI x86_64 platform requires bootloader
+   support. Elilo with x86_64 support can be used.
+
+3. x86_64 platform with EFI/UEFI firmware.
+
+Mechanics:
+---------
+- Build the kernel with the following configuration.
+	CONFIG_FB_EFI=y
+	CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
+- Create a VFAT partition on the disk
+- Copy the following to the VFAT partition:
+	elilo bootloader with x86_64 support, elilo configuration file,
+	kernel image built in first step and corresponding
+	initrd. Instructions on building elilo	and its dependencies
+	can be found in the elilo sourceforge project.
+- Boot to EFI shell and invoke elilo choosing the kernel image built
+  in first step.
