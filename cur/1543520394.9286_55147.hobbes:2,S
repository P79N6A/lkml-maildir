you can get it that low if you try, but by default its in the teens.  i
think phhttpd is  in the 4-5 range, and could be far less if we could get
rid of the annoying fcntl()s by having an F_INHERITANCE flag that would
allos fds to inherit some flags from their parent.  hpux has been doing
this for ages.

[a quick aside that Arjan is probably well aware of; if you have a
dedicated serving machine with lots of mem you can crank the per socket
write buffers into the stratosphere so that the kernel will pump more out
of them before asking userspace to full them]

roughly, yeah.  We keep a response cache so that going from the requested
url to data on the wire is a hash on the url.  the poll info bearing sigio
signals give us a light weight way to further work on all our connections.

thats a current annoyance with phhttpd.  the server backing it has to be
aware that its around.  but with plenty of nice open source servers, I
don't think this is a problem :) just grab the rpm :)  and yeah, you can
config the hacked apache not to care about phhttpd at all.

no.  nfs has lots of nasty caching/locking problems that make it far nicer
to put in the kernel, its vastly different than httpd.

We can do this portably and with zero copy in time if we do clever things
with async io and kiobufs..

yes, choice is a good thing folks :)
but we're veering far from discussion that is appropriate on l-k.  I'll
post something here when phhttpd is ready to roll.
