Not in stock kernel, no.
There's a patch in -ac series which implements 'suid_dumpable' attribute.
It is included with RedHat kernels I think.
The fun stuff is that I wasn't able to use the functionality anyway (i
had similar but a bit worse problem) -- regardless of how hard i tried,
it didn't produce any core dumps ;)

P.S.  Hi, Ralf! The world is too small! ;)
