Hi,
	Under recent 2.5 kernels, my laptop runs a lot hotter than
under 2.4.20 -- the fans seem to go continuously, the disc never
powers down, and consequently battery life is around half what it is
with 2.4.20.
I'm using XFS, mounted with the	`noatime' option, and a 5-minute
xfs_sync value, in both cases.
The laptop has ACPI only, no APM.  On battery, the processor (a 2GHz
Pentium 4) is dropped to 1GHz and put into ACPI C3 state.
Does anyone have any ideas about what's changed, and how it can be
fixed to get better battery life again?   Maybe XFS is
syncing its logs more often, or something.
