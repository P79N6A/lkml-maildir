The problem is the extra code in the schedule() path, not in the timer
tick path.  It is traversed FAR more often.
The current tick at 1/HZ is really quite relaxed.  Given the PIT (ugh!)
the longest we can put off a tick is about 50 ms.  This means that any
time greater than this will require more than one interrupt, i.e. the
best case improvement by going tick less (again given the PIT) is about
5 times.  Other platforms/ hardware, of course, change this.
