V 0.3.3 is now on
 
ftp://oboe.it.uc3m.es/pub/Programs/yoke-0.3.3.tgz.
This is a "union block (virtual) device". It does transparant
hot mirroring. You can bind any device to any other device
while they are working and they'll start mirroring each other.
Tested for functionality on loop and scsi. Against 2.2.10.
Reports please. Might need altering on ide - I haven't yet
tested. Set DEBUG 0 to avoid reams of info.
