Yes, an RTOS certainly helps.  Otherwise you cannot guarantee a minimum
frame rate - if a long running disk ISR fires then you are screwed,
because jsut as with low latency audio you have a SCHED_FIFO userspace
process that is feeding data to the GPU at a constant rate.  Its a worse
problem with audio because you absolutely cannot drop a frame or you
will hear it.  With video it's likely to be imperceptible.
