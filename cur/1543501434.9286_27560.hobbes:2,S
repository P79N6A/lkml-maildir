Try the ac5-patch. I had several lockups when I first tried 2.2.10,
but after I tried this patch, they seem to have disappeared.
The lockups usually happened when I ripped or burned CDs. I never
reported them (or wrote down any oopses), because I upgraded my system
to Redhat 6 at the same time, and I wanted to make sure it wasn't
something with the new glibc that caused my lockups.
I also saw lockups with 2.2.9. Never tried 2.2.[678]. 2.2.5 and
earlier seemed pretty stable on my system.
