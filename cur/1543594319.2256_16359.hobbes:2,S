Hi,
the following patch makes use of the fact that refill_inactive()
now calls swap_out() before calling refill_inactive_scan() and
the fact that the inactive_dirty list is now reclaimed in a fair
LRU order.
Background scanning can now be replaced by a simple call to
refill_inactive(), instead of the refill_inactive_scan(), which
gave mapped pages an unfair advantage over unmapped ones.
The special-casing of the amount to scan in refill_inactive_scan()
is removed as well, there's absolutely no reason we'd need it with
the current VM balance.
regards,
Rik
