this is exactly what we ran into, you can't use skb list because the
ip fragmentation reassembly code overwrites it.  If someone is feeling
particularly miffed by this i would love to see a patch that used
alloc_page() for all of our receive buffers for the legacy receive
path (e1000_clean_rx_irq) then we would be able to use nr_frags and
frag_list for receives.
Oh, except that eth_type_trans can't handle the entire packet in the
frag_list (it wants the header in the skb->data)
anyway, this is not as easy a problem to solve as it would seem on the surface.
