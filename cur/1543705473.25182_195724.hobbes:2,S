Yep:

I'm getting this with the Promise 20376. Presumably not a hardware 
problem: I can't reproduce it under Windows XP with Promise's supplied 
Windows driver, and Jeff Garzik calls it a known bug -- "should have a 
fix soon".
Jeff, is it "known" in the sense that you know roughly what goes wrong, 
but just haven't gotten around to fixing it? I'd like to tinker and try 
to fix it, but am "unfamiliar around those parts".
