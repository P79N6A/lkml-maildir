The reboot EFI runtime service is needed because otherwise we have no
way to tell firmware whether a warm or cold reboot is requested. The
"0x472" protocol is used by legacy BIOS, but not by EFI based firmware.
For EFI based firmware, the parameter to runtime service call is the
only way to tell firmware whether a warm or cold reboot is requested.
That is not implemented by current EFI support patch yet, but we will
add it in the next version.

Yes. Reboot via EFI should be implemented as a new type of
"reboot_type".
