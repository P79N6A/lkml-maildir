I really liked this approach because:
* it is similar to other *nixes. (freebsd, openbsd)
* it is easily tuneable (/proc or systcl)
* it is stupid simple - small chance that things can go wrong.
* this solves *many* things in comparation to possible problems it
causes.
Only thing that could be a problem that I come to think of is that you
cannot raise the limit through /etc/security/limits.conf or similar. Eg.
you migh want all setuid() services/daemons run with a low limit but you
want give user Bob more processes. (I don't know if this is a realistic
situation though)
The default value could be something like:
max_user_threads = max_threads / 2
or:
max_user_threads = max_threads / 4;
With a lower limit to 20 or something, just like max_threads (in case
you try run Linux on 2MiB RAM)
If a fixed value (like 300, 512, 2000) is used then will probably
systems with low amount of RAM be vulerable to the forkbomb attack.
