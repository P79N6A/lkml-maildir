G'damn!!!!  That's so poetically accurate, I've added it to my sig list.
I've worked in a large tech corporation for many years, (20+) and I've
relatively recently had to attempt to `open` some managerial minds, and
discovered futility of it all.
"A company's public perception is an invaluable asset, that must be dealt with
kid gloves"  (not to mention managerial politics and positioning)
P.S.  Yes, I think that Microsoft does have some of the better software products
out there, but they'll never be able to take away my right to choose.  Without
Linux, I probably wouldn't say that with such confidence!!!
PPSS  Microsoft has proven that performance, is in fact, not everything, but
Gnome, and KDE have taken that point to an extreme.
PPPSSS I'm looking for that to change within 5 years.
