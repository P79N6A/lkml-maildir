Subject: [PATCH CYCLADES 2/2] update drivers/char/Kconfig cyclades entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
I've cleaned up the Kconfig entry for the cyclades serial boards, this
makes it more obvious what the entry refers to in my mind.  
I'd also ask you to remove drivers/char/README.cyclomY since it's
*way* out of date and refers to an ancient version of the driver and
MAKEDEV scripts.
Thanks,
John
