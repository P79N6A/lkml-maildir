Hello,
If an i686 SMP machine has sat idle for a period of time (overnight),
an attempt of log in will result in /sbin/login dropping core.
The getty is not affected. A subsequent login will succeed. This
occurs for each configured virtual terminal, i.e., Alt-F1 through Alt-F4.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
