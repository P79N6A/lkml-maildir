Subject: [PATCH] sparc atomic_clear_mask build fix

This fixes one build error introduced in sparc with the patch
of Oct 30, resent Nov 4 "[patch 3/5] atomic: atomic_inc_not_zero"
I still can't get sparc to build, but at least it gets further
after I remove this line.  Apparently, this change was agreed to
by Andrew and Nick on Nov 14, but everyone thought someone else
was doing it.
