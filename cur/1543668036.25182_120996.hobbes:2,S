Let me absolutely clear I did it to fix the bounces from my
script not because I think the list admin sucks.
If the XXX substring is such a problem its time to increase
the pain factor. I think XXX will begin appearing in the body

XXX subject bouncers to kernel.org should get kicked off but I
appreciate you have rather more useful things to be doing 8)
