I don't see why all IDE-interfaces in the world have to be I/O-mapped just 
because the first PC implementations used that. Sure it was an extended 
ISA-bus but the ISA bus is long gone and we don't all run PC's anymore 
either.
So the simple abstraction we need to hit IDE-bus registers is a macro or 
inline, instead of a call of an I/O-primitive. It was too much work to 
abstract this when I inserted the CRIS-arch IDE-driver in the first place 
so I found a workaround but now seems like a better time..
Similarily, there is no reason at all why the CPU has to do _polling_ just 
because the IDE _bus_ is using a PIO-mode. It probably does that on legacy 
PC's but HW designed, hrm, more optimally can use DMA. Hence the hooks for 
the ide_func_t.
So I'd figure the software side really would be _easier_ to implement with 
those assumptions about how an IDE-interface is supposed to work gone.

I understand that, so lets keep the discussion going and I'll check over 
your current cleanup.
