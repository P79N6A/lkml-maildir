Clients and server are running Debian/Sid (one client amd64, the rest i386) 
with given kernel version. Nfs userspace is at version 1.0.7. The kernel was 
made using Debian's "gcc version 4.0.2 20050917 (prerelease) (Debian 
4.0.1-8))".
The server is using the kernelspace server.

I will try. But i will have to reconfigure client and server first ...
