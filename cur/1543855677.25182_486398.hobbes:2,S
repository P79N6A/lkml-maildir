Subject: [PATCH 8/12] ext4 balloc: fix off-by-one against grp_goal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Subject: ext2 balloc: fix off-by-one against grp_goal
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>
grp_goal 0 is a genuine goal (unlike -1), so ext2_try_to_allocate_with_rsv
should treat it as such.

Sync up with ext2 reservation fix  in ext4
