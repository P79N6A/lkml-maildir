The pages to be freed are only allocated in suspend_prepare_image()
(now swsusp_save()), which is on suspend, and this is the resume
error path.
The boot kernel that performs the resume does not save highmem,
so it need not and IMO it should not call restore_highmem() in the
error path (if nothing more, it's misleading).  OTOH if the resume
succeeds, restore_highmem() will be called from swsusp_suspend().
