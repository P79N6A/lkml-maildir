Yes.  I had to step back and remind myself why I care as daemonize is
currently doing an effective job of removing the namespace information.
However there is nothing daemonize can do about the pid of the task
because it is returned by kernel_thread and used by the callers 
(to at the very least find the task_struct).
So not finishing that conversion is certainly one of the last blockers
for implementing the pid namespace.
