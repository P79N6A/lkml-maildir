This has been discussed and the conclusion was basically that if
something needs to be changed to solve a problem, it has to be
changed, whether it is a stable kernel or not is irrelevant. This
happend some time during 2.0.x for instance.
The point is that we are not willing to pay the price of guaranteeing
an API just for the sake of making life easier for people who wants to
do binary only drivers. The solution is simple, the people who really
wants binary only drivers can implement a thin wrapper layer and Open
Source it and then allow people to change it if a kernel interface
changes.
