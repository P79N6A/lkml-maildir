The problem is not that the mptspi module is missing. It is correctly 
inserted in the initrd. The problem is whichever order I set in the 
initrd concerning the module loading, I always got an symbol errors.
And what is really strange is that the 'sleep 1' solved the error...
I was wondering if this is not linked to hardware probe issue. It seems 
the kernel need few seconds to correctly initialize each module, and if 
another module is loaded at the same time, this hangs.
Very strange...
