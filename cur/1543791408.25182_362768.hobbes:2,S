The whole idea is that they may indeed get reused, but so long as
they're reused as anon_vma slab objects, with the same layout as before,
it's safe for page_lock_anon_vma to spin_lock(&anon_vma->lock): that
will still be a valid anon_vma->lock it's taking, and the worst that
can happen is that the caller will then search an irrelevant list for
the page it's looking for, and not find it (usually it'll just be an
empty list, when the anon_vma has not yet been put to use again).
An in-use anon_vma is only freed back to slab cache when its list
of vmas is empty, determined while holding anon_vma->lock.
The danger that RCU is used to guard against there, is that the slab
might be destroyed in between reading page->mapping and acquiring
anon_vma->lock, and its memory reused for something very different
e.g. anon_vma->lock no longer a spin_lock, but something which will
freeze that attempt to get the lock.
I think it's a technique which deserves to be used more widely.

Phew!  It seems I'm off the hook (but having said that, I'll probably
turn out to be guilty in some other way).  Sorry, I don't have any
ideas (and have never reproduced this here).
