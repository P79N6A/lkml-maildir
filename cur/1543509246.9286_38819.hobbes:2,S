This is a conversation I had with the bplay author...is there
a way to get SEMMSL at runtime?  How do I include
headers to get it in userspace?
thanks...

I'm trying to compile bplay (with redhat 6.0).
I initially got:
shmbuf.c:131: `SEMMSL' undeclared (first use in this function)
shmbuf.c:131: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
shmbuf.c:131: for each function it appears in.)
shmbuf.c: In function `up':
shmbuf.c:159: `SEMMSL' undeclared (first use in this function)
shmbuf.c: In function `down':
shmbuf.c:172: `SEMMSL' undeclared (first use in this function)
shmbuf.c: In function `initsems':
shmbuf.c:430: `SEMMSL' undeclared (first use in this function)
So I saw where it was defined (in linux/sem.h) so I thought I was being
clever by adding:
: leisner@soyata;rcsdiff -u shmbuf.c

Now I get:

Is  SEMMSL something which is supposed to be in user space?
I can't find a reference on it...(I ended up just using
	gcc -DSEMMSL=32
and it seemed to work...
It also seems to me this should be a runtime constant rather than
a compile time constant?
I'd figure I'd bounce this off you before I query
linux-kernel...

Umm. Yes, the bplay code is very old (libc4 if I remeber rightly). Setting
-DSEMMSL=32 is a good workaround for now. In fact you are right; these days it
ought to be retreived at runtime, but I'm not sure I know how to do this. Maybe
sysconf() or something. If you find a way, tell me :-)
I have nearly finished writing bplay2 which is a complete rewrite using posix
threading rather than the old SYSV IPC mechanisms, but it isn't quite right
yet.
Cheers,
	David
