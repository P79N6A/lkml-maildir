Anything can be taken to the ridiculous extreme: "let's use ci() and co()!
We will document 'em and everything will be fine!"
Let's abstain from this type of discussion.

In the ideal world. We're in the real world and there *is* broken code,
as demonstrated by Rusty. If we can reduce chances of programming errors by 
choosing good names, we have to do it.
Which name is 'good'/too short/too long is up to "big boys" to decide.
I presume they know better, I don't hack on kernel day and night. They do.
