If we are really lucky or unlucky it will happen again. 
Zeroed-out block just might be a kernel problem (SMP race, whatever) -
random corruption would more likely be a hardware problem. There were no IO
error either. But, 2.4 ext3 has been pretty extensively tested, so I don't
suppose that's likely either. And judging from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/ChangeLog-2.4.3
[45] there
haven't been many changes to ext3 lately either.
