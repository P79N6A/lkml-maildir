Yes, that's actually part of what I meant with my first quoted
paragraph above. Did not come out that way, sorry.
I can see one problem on unload, if the memory used by the module is
freed while another CPU is executing the module code, but it should be
easy enough to protect against with a lock. 
Assuming that loads are unloads are manually serialized in the
correct order are there any other problems?
