This error is (mostly) harmless. It is just telling you that a file
was attempted deleted, but that the deletion couldn't be completed
(it's a bug in our implementation of so-called silly-deletes). I've
got a fix for this as part of a set of patches that also cure problems
with suid processes and the like, but Linus wanted to clean them up
first.
In the meantime, you're unfortunately going to have to delete files
such as the above by hand whenever you get the above message. Sorry.
Cheers,
  Trond
