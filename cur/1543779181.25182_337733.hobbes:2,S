I think your problem is this: HT has depended on CONFIG_ACPI for
some while, and now in 2.6.13-rc CONFIG_ACPI depends on CONFIG_PM.
You don't have CONFIG_PM set in your .config (nor had I), so you
don't get ACPI, so you don't get HT.
I don't know why CONFIG_ACPI now depends on CONFIG_PM: it seemed
gratuitous when it first hit me, looked like someone just felt it
was a nice arrangement.  But seems particularly unhelpful for HT.
On the other hand, I can well understand Len wanting to simplify
the ACPI config interdependencies, which have caused breakage
after breakage after breakage.
