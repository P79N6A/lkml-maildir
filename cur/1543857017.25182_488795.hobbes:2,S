VIA south gets used by a lot of the systems but the VIA North bridges
I've got docs for cover only x86 variants, although one of the older ones
implies it has both K7 and Alpha support (just as the AMD chipset does)
Personally I'd rather know when I broke stuff by getting everything
to compile that sanely compiles. Operating the ".config" file is not
complex after all.
