I would agree if it were a complete feature, but it's not.  PC9800
cannot be selected for compilation in the current kernel.  Without an
external patch set, it cannot be compiled or used.  As far as I can
tell, it's always been like that.
I think the best way of making someone sit up and take notice is simply
to remove it.  After all, given that we have the kernel under source
control it's not like it's going to be hard to put it back if someone
actually does notice and screams...
