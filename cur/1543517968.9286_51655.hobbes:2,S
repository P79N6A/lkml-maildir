Yep, send me a FAQ patch.

This mindset comment is an important one. People on all sides should
take note. For the "outsiders", it can be hard to understand that
there is a definate mindset, and even harder to determine what it is.
For the "insiders", it can be hard to understand that others *don't*
know what the mindset is, and that while they think they're being
clear, outsiders are only getting the ciphertext.
This disparity is one of the causes of friction on this list. It's a
shame, because at the end of the day, most (all?) of us are on the
same side: to build a better Linux. So step back and smell the roses
before you post again :-)
