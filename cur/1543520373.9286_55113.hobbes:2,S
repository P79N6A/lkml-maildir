NIT: The REAL limitation for POSIX file sizes on 32-bit architectures isn't
*directly* from POSIX, but rather, indirectly from ISO/ANSI C (which is
assumed by POSIX).
o In POSIX, the lseek() file offset is defined as off_t.  There's nothing
  to prevent a 32-bit POSIX-compliant implementation from typedef'ing off_t
  as a 64-bit signed "long long".
o Similarly, ISO/ANSI C's fsetpos()/fgetpos() can be fixed by typedef'ing
  fpos_t to be a 64-bit long long.
o The problem lies with ISO/ANSI C's fseek()/ftell(), which use a "long"
  for the offset.  Why fpos_t wasn't used (consistently!) is beyond me, but
  hindsight is 20/20.  AFAIK, these are the only two functions that *must*
  break if >2GB files are permitted with 32-bit longs.  Other functions
  *can* break (like the present case), but aren't *required* to break by
  the POSIX+C standards.
Thus, it is _ISO/ANSI C compatibility_ that is necessarily broken for file
systems that support >2GB files with 32-bit longs -- something that applies
even to non-POSIX file systems that claim compatibility with ISO/ANSI C.
I'm sure you all can think of at least two, but that's a discussion for the
advocacy lists.  ;^)
This comes up often enough (and is misunderstood enough) it belongs in an
FAQ, but I don't know which one.  Suggestions?
