Why not?  Do you have numbers showing that this is inefficient?  Have
you looked at using libsysfs to make it easier for your program to
access sysfs?

No, please just use the filesystem.

Not true.  Please read the /sbin/hotplug script to find out how your
program can get those notifications.

It does that already today.  Again, please read the documentation that
is already included in the program.
