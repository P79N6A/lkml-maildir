Agreed.  Although the implementation of the /proc lid status
file is fundamentally flawed in that even its name in /proc
is able to change and thus it is a totally bogus user-space API,
it was not thoughtful to delete it.
I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this transition.
I can make ACPI_PROC a static build option -- what else
can I do to ease the transition in this, our stable release?
thanks,
