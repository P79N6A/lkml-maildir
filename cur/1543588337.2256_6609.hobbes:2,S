Since upgrading to 2.4.4-pre5 my PCMCIA wireless network card no longer works.
Here's a snippet of the dmesg output from 2.4.4-pre5:
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Intel PCIC probe: not found.
ds: no socket drivers loaded!
However, it works fine in both 2.4.4-pre4 and 2.4.3-ac10.  Here's the relevant
portion of the dmesg output from 2.4.3-ac10:
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Intel PCIC probe:
  Intel i82365sl B step ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x3e0 ofs 0x00, 2 sockets
    host opts [0]: none
    host opts [1]: none
    ISA irqs (scanned) = 3,4,5,7,9,10 polling interval = 1000 ms
after which comes a series of cs IO port and memory probes.  BTW, I'm using
pcmcia-cs-3.1.25.
