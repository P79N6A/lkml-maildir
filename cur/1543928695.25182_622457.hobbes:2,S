Umm, trace_special_sym() is ifdefed out, because UML doesn't have
save_stack_trace().

I'll have a look.

Yes.  The UML kernel is UP, and I don't think 'date' or 'bash' want to
do any disk I/O.
Could disk I/O be blocking the tty?  I think UML uses separate threads
for these, but I don't know the details.
