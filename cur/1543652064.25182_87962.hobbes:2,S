You could do this with the interface provided by kwatchpoints patch [1]
without directly mucking with debug registers. The interface is simple:
int register_kwatch(unsigned long addr, u8 length, u8 type,
                kwatch_handler_t handler)
If you don't want to use debug registers or if they are not enough,
only other possibility I can think of is to find all code locations 
where the MMIO space of interest is touched and put execution 
probes there.
[1] You will need these two patches:
