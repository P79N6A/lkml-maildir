some of the x86 SMP bits in 2.2 have been recently (a few months ago) 
streamlined to ease future hot-swapping of CPUs. Given the hardware
supports it of course. Swapping CPUs kernel-wise should now be pretty
easy.
hot-swapping PCI is a completely different animal - i suspect the recent
2.3 resource management advancements enable it as well.
