The problem being that some of us use their laptops for audio work too.
And then high battery usage, noisy fans or lack of high res timers will
be really bad.
Simple example:
I do final mastering work using my laptop and Ardour/Jack/JAMin out of
house in a place with a good stage audio system (Mackie mixer, 2KW
Dynacord Amp/Syrincs S3) and a sufficient listening space to get a
proper bass mix. I run on battery in this case to avoid any kind of
audio interference (ground loops, etc). Now thinking of a dual core
laptop...
