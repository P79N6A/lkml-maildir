Given that your stated goal is to minimize disk reads, to me at least reading 
once and sending via TCP on multiple sockets seems to make sense, and is the 
only option that actually gives you direct control over the reads.
If it was an advantage for the receivers to have the file as soon as possible, 
you might be able to do slightly better by sending the whole file once as UDP to 
all listeners and then filling in the blanks later.  This way, some of the 
listeners would get the file on the first pass and not have to wait for the 
lowest common denominator.  You probably wouldn't gain much though.
