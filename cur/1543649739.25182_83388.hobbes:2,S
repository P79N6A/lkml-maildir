I wanted to seperate the hotswap functionality from the main scsi code. 
 I also feel
that hotswap shouldn't be a function of proc.  Also, the patch I 
supplied supports
fibrechannel hotswap as well.  Your patch looks pretty good and I plan 
to change
the proc_scsi_gen_write() to use the scsi hotswap commands in hotswap.c. 
 The
advantage of this technique is that the HBA_ptr doesn't have to be known 
(and
this generic code can go in the actual routine instead of the proc 
parsing routine).
The final advantage of having seperate comands is less time is spent 
passing and
parsing text data.  Plus my patch provides usage information for those 
that don't
or can't read the source code to understand the interface :)
As far as I'm concerned, I'd be happy to entirely remove the 
proc_scsi_gen_write
code, but I think that might confuse some people.
As for the interfaces stomping each other, I've added correct locking to 
proc_scsi_gen_write()
to ensure that the host_queue is locked during access so changes to it 
cannot occur
during hotswap operations.  This keeps a scsi_device entry from being 
deleted while
the list is being parsed, resulting in bad magic.
