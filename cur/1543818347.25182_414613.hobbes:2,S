checking for DRQ_STAT again doesn't make sense, how can it ever be
anything but DRQ_STAT if DRQ_STAT is set?

And this looks very wrong, you can't write to the status register. Well
you can, but then it's the command register! Writing stat & 0xef to the
command register is an odd thing to do. I think you just want to clear
the DRQ bit, which should be fine after it was read initially. How about
        if (stat & DRQ_STAT)
                return ide_stopped;
Can you test that?
