It's code that causes added hardship for anybody checking the locking.
It becomes impossible to see whether locks are balanced and turns into
a nightmare as soon as you need error exits from several depths of locking
or with and without memory to be freed.
Please listen to experience.
err_out_buffer:
	kfree(buffer);
err_out_nobuffer:
	up(&sem);
err_out_nolock:
	return err;
is pretty much the only readable construction.
