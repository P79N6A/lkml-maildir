I've stated earlier that I was locked up in fs/inode.c with the
__wait_on_freeing_inode. Can this be switched to a schedule_timeout?
Of course schedule_timeout is not too good with RT as well. Although you
can prevent a live_deadlock, but we bring up the problem of priority
inversion again. The process needing to run can still be starved by
another higher priority process that is lower in priority as the one
doing the waiting.
The schedule_timeout should stop the livelock. But what is the effect of
switching to it?
