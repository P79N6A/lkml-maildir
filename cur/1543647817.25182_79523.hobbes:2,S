And what about setups where you can't pull the reset line from software.
I have several machines here like that.  And one of them needs software
to talk to the cards to put them back into a sane state before rebooting.
"rebooting" in this particular case is "turn MMU off, jump to location 0"
And I never said anything about needing to allocate memory to do this.
I agree with you that suspending devices on reboot _is_ silly.  However,
that's not what I was proposing.
