Yes, I'm very positive about it. This is Plextor Premium; it certainly can
handle 700, 800 and even larger (99m/1.2GiB) CDs, I'm burning my backups on it
on regular basis, too. I'll try to grab a few more CD-RWs tomorrow.

Nope:
# cdrwtool -d /dev/cdrw -m 259808
using device /dev/cdrw
formatting 259808 blocks
4690KB internal buffer
setting write speed to 12x
wait_cmd: Input/output error
Command failed: 04 17 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - sense 05.64.00
