Actually, the only problem with the patch is that it is not
byte-order-safe, which means that you cannot cross-compile from a
big-endian host.
I don't see any real problem in extending syssize to be 4 bytes, as the
two ne wbytes that it writes over are the "swap_dev" bytes that I don't
think anybody ever used. We might as well get rid of them. And thanks to
being little-endian, it would not change for loaders that don't know about
the new 4-byte format (the two low bytes are still the same).
So I won't apply the patch as-is, but fix it to be endian-safe and get
some input from other bootloaders (assuming they all agree that swap_dev
is a non-issue - which I think they will) and I _will_ apply it.

I'd be careful about calling other people stupid if you don't understand
the code.
Using "buf" the way the code used it meant that people whose native
byte-order was big-endian would still be able to build images. Performance
was never a big issue here, so it works fine. It may not be pretty, but I
doubt beauty was a big issue either ;)
The field never got extended because nobody really needed it extended.
That's as simple as it can get, no?
