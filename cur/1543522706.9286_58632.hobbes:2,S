The patch is coded for 2.3.5 until 2.3.20.

When I speak about number of processes I speak as loaded testing processes, 
not runqueue processes.
Even in my test the average number of runnable is from 15 to 35.
And remember that my patch has no optimization for CPU cache lines, etc..
I think that supplied with that kinds of optimizations the results will be even
better the ones I measured.
I'm interested in the measuring system implemented by IBM coz I've not spent a
lot of time in my testing console.
IBM guys also have my patch from 2-3 months ago.
Cheers,
	Davide.
