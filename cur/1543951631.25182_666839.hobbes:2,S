Okay. If someone is tracking this as a 2.6.25 regresion, it can be stricken 
of that list.

What does cat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_ALPHA_ say? Miuchael, and for 
you? For some Alpha configs, arch/alpha/kernel/es1888.c is compiled and for 
some not. I expect for you (Bob) it's compiled in? And Michael?
