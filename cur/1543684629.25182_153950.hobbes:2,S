I really don't understand the point behind the synaptics code. I would
have imagined it to be an extension to the generic PS/2 code that would
finally allow me to use my 'scroll buttons' on my trackpad, but it has
caused nothing but problems. and I'm also kind of a console jockey so I
really need GPM working, which is why i'm always booting with
psmouse_noext these days...
