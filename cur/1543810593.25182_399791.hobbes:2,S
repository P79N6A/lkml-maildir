Hi Christoph Hellwig,
Thanks for your comment with "arcmsr".
I will follow your comment to redo this driver.
But I am confuse with your mention about some items.
Hope you can tell me more detail and let me realy know your comment.
  1- remove internal queueing:
      Does the "internal queueing" is mention with arcmsr of ccb_free_list ?
  2- fix hardware datastructures:
      Does the "fix hardware datastructures" is to fix struct ARCMSR_CDB?
      Is it illeagal in linux?
  3- remove odd ioctls:
      How about remove odd ioctl?
Best Regards
Erich Chen
