I cannot remember what exactly, but there is some weirdness with sysfs
and using find.  And unfortunately I could only test the driver with one
of the many chips it support (which on the newer Asus boards is not the
as99127f).  Can you attach a dmesg though ?
I will be back home in about 12-14 hours, then I can have a look ... is
this before or ater the easter deadline ? =)
