Ten years ago, I would have agreed with you. I suggested a very 
similar change for VTIME=0;VMIN>0 behavior back then, while we 
were porting SVR4 to proprietary hardware. This was for 
compatibility with the way reads were handled on a previous 
non-un*x product. It was deemed a spec violation, so we added an 
ioctl to implement the compatible behavior. 
Does the spec say that VMIN behavior depends on the size of a 
blocking read? No, it says that the read completes when VMIN or 
more characters have been received. If VMIN is three and two 
characters have been received, completing a blocking read of any 
size is a violation. Should we also add a "read buffer size" 
parameter to select and poll, etc. so they can report that read 
data is available before satisfying VMIN, too? 
Ted, Russell, please weigh in on this. 
Best regards,
Ed
