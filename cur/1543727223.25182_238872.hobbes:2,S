What I'd need out of the PM framework would be "suspend this subtree",
and its cousin "resume this subtree".  Where the subtree starts with a
given device ... and, if it's got a driver, any abstract devices created
by that driver.  (And their children, etc.)
I'm not sure what to think about the desire of "suspend2" to prevent
a subtree from suspending.  In fact, I'm not at all sure how to even
interpret a "can't suspend" failure code... device in trouble, likely.
