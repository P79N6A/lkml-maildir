That was my parport patch, thanks for the fix.
This bring up something I was thinking about the other day:  I am kinda
disappointed that the choice was made to ditch the !CONFIG_PCI code from
pci.h.  There used to be a ton of inlined helpers which replaced all the
PCI functions with no-ops, preventing problems like this parport
breakage.
Maybe I am one of the few who doesn't mind bloating driver code a tiny
bit in order to  handle the !CONFIG_PCI case without ugly ifdefs in
driver code...
