Imagine the fun you will have trying to write a file name and being told 
you cannot write it for some unknown reason.  Unbeknownst to you, there is 
a file there, but it is not owned by you, thus invisible.
Making a file system more user oriented would avoid little gotchas like 
this.  The reason it is "programmer oriented" is that those are the people 
who have worked out why it works and why certain things are bad ideas.
