Thanks :)

CPUs have gotten so fast now that its quite possible to run the tasklet 
in parallel with the next invocation of the interrupt handler.
But given the amount of tasklet use in network drivers, I do not think 
tasklets can just be magically equated to workqueues, without 
case-by-case analysis.

Indeed!

Indeed.
