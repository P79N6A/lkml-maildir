I _HATE_ dirty hacks which gives some more speed and that loses a clean
interface. All string functions works careless about the alignment of the
buffers, and the same should be done by the chksum routine. I don't want
special cases just to get some more speed. I perfectly know that currently
all callers are using 32bit aligned buffers, that's not my point at all.
