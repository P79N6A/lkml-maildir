I think that using the -git web interface to Linus' tree on kernel.org 
is even better.
The following is a link to the top-level of the kernel source tree:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=tree
You will notice a Documentation tree link (3rd file object link from the 
top).
This will get you the most current Documentation at the moment from 
Linus' tree, and it also gives you the ability to see the history of 
changes.
Hope this helps.
