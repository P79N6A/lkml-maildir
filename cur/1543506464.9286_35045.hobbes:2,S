Hello All,
    I have a question about the proper way to do something.  I want to
mmap() a file, munge around its data, and then shorten the file using
the ftruncate() system call.  My question is what happens to the mapping
between the new end and the old end of the file.  Does it automatically
get munmap()ed or do I need to explicitly munmap() it.
Thanks,
Jim
