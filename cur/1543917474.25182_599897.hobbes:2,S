Actually, I belileve we should base it on qc->sect_size instead.
Then, if somebody also would like to submit a patch introducing
a cleanup() method, then please do so!
As a separate patch, though (seems to be the "libata way").

I think this original patch still applies cleanly on at least 2.6.23-rc7.
Drain up to 512 words from host/bridge FIFO on stuck DRQ HSM violation,
rather than just getting stuck there forever.
