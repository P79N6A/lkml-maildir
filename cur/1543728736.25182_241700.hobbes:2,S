Subject: binfmt_misc trouble with kernel 2.6.7

Hi,
A few days ago I upgraded to fedora kernel 2.6.7-1.494.2.2. Before that, 
I had kernels in which binfmt_misc was compiled as a module. The wine 
init script modprobe'd the module and then registered /usr/bin/wine as a 
handler for windows executables. However, in the new 2.6.7 kernel, 
binfmt_misc is compiled into the kernel, so the modprobe in the wine 
init script fails. I can fix that, but main problem I am having is that 
now, the permissions on the /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc directory are 0555:
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Aug 13 19:04 /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
I cannot create a file called register under /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc.
I created a Fedora bugzilla entry for this but I was told that this is a 
problem in the kernel upstream. Is this indeed a known problem, and is 
there a fix?
