Because
  - I do not want to give heart attack to all existing LLDDs
  - Some LLDD would never be able to be changed
  - Some LLDD work on very _scarce_ hardware which we cannot test.
  - plus such radical changes are neither warranted nor necessary.
It is better to keep legacy around, until all you'll have on
your new serverboard is a SAS/SATA storage chip such as
AIC-94xx or say BCM8603.  Then you can compile out most
of the legacy stuff.

Well, I can never have it right.  Some people say you shouldn't break
it, others say let's break the whole thing and give heart attack
to all LLDDs, other say it is impossible to change all LLDD since
the hardware is not around, etc, etc.
I think not breaking anything (for now at least) would be the
_easiest_ and most painless way to transition.

Well, not necessarily.  It would be more painful and more maintainer
load if we did what you suggest.  The overhead would be enormous.

Me too, but we are idealists.  Politics is an integral part of
life.
Long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
I literally sat in a meeting whereby technical staff of _several_
companies agreed that Pi=3.0.
