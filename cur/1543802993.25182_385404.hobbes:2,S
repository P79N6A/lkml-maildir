Subject: [PATCH] Time: Timekeeping Fixups for 2.6.15-mm3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hey Andrew,
	Below are two quick fixes I found while reviewing the timekeeping
patches currently in -mm. 
The first chunk fixes a missed return in the
time-fix-cpu-frequency-detection.patch which could possibly cause
interrupts to be disabled and never re-enabled (although the failure
case is unlikely, so this probably isn't biting anyone).
The second chunk removes a bit of code that was unnecessarily duplicated
in time-reduced-ntp-rework-part-2.patch that bumps the time_maxerror
variable each second (which is already done at the top of the function).
The code must of slipped in while moving the code in an earlier version
of the patch and didn't get removed as it should have been.
thanks
