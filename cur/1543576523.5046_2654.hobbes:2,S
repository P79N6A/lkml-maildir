I'm just wondering how you are going to do 1 Gbyte per second when you
still have to get the data through a PCI bus to that card. In theory,
standard PCI can do 133 Mbyte/s, but only when you're very lucky to be
able to burst large chunks of data. OK, 64 bit PCI at 66 MHz should
quadruple the throughput, but that's still not enough for 1 Gbyte/s.
