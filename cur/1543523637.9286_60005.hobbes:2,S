 Dick:
       I was able to get the debug prints to work in the setup.S and
found that things are ok until "call video". It looks like it never
returns from the video.S code. With it hanging in the video routine
I tested setting "vga=normal", and "vga=ask" with no change. I have
removed the "3dfx voodoo3 2000 PCI" video card, and tried another
normal Trident SVGA card, but it still hangs the same way. My
motherboard is using American Megatrends AMIBIOS 6/30/98. Next
I tried to comment out the "call video" in setup.S which allowed
things to continue, but this hangs even on my laptop. I guess
the video subroutine is setting someting that is needed. Unless
someone has an idea about what might cause this problem I plan to
continue my debugging in the video.S.

At the top of the file, line 179, you will see a routine called
prtchr. It prints a character in the AL register. Just ahead of
it is prtstr, it prints a string, but don't use it because you
have to set the DS register, restore it later, etc.
Just, moving through the code, do:
		mov 0x30, al    # ASCII '0'
		call prtchr
		.... more code, possible hung loops
		mov 0x31, al	# ASCII '1'
		call prtchr
... etc.
You will have 0123 on the screen if it hangs between '3' and '4'.
Easy! Have fun.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
