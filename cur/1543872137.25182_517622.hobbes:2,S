It's the fact that we need to leave code in the kernel to run on native,
but also do something dynamically with that same code when running
paravirt that I'm referring to.  Xen punts on this right now by
#ifdef'ing away as happy as can be.

No, it's not the IPI itself, it's the way it's often accessed by the rest of
the kernel (which is intertwined with genapic).  I'm happy to avoid apic
altogether since it's effectively worthless for Xen other than
integrating into the existing infrastructure.
