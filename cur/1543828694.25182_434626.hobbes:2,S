No, I'm not sure.
My HW is PCISA-C800EVN-1G industrial MB (VT82C686B chipset) with integrated CF adapter.
The adapter seems to have all pins soldered.
I don't have another CF with DMA capability, so I can't check who creates the problem  --
the card or the adapter.
Let's see if someone have similar motherboard & CF with dma capabilities.
