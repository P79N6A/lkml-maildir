good catch, your observations are correct.
btw., have you checked the 2.5 kernel's scheduler? It does all these
things correctly: it queues freshly woken up tasks to the tail of the
queue, it does not reschedule SCHED_FIFO tasks every timer tick and does
not move RT tasks to the head of the queue in sys_setscheduler().
in terms of 2.4.18, the timer and the setscheduler() change is OK, but i
dont think we want the add_to_runqueue() change. It changes wakeup
characteristics for non-RT tasks, it could affect any many-threads or
many-processes application adversely. And we've been doing FIFO wakeups
like this for ages and nobody complained, so it's not that we are in a big
hurry. Fundamental changes like this are fair game for the 2.5 kernel.
[and we dont even know the full performance impact of this change even in
2.5, although it's been in since 2.5.3 or so. The full effect of things
like this will show up during beta-testing of 2.6 i suspect.] Plus this
change does not make *that* much of a difference - not many people use
SCHED_FIFO tasks with the same priority, the typical usage is to sort the
tasks by priority - this is one reason why there's a push to increase the
number of RT priority levels to something like 1000 in the 2.5 kernel.  
And if multiple SCHED_FIFO tasks have the same priority then exact
scheduling is more like the matter of luck anyway.
I've attached a minimal patch for 2.4.18 which does the other two things
only - the timer optimization has no semantical impact, and the
setscheduler() change only affects tasks that switch between RT and non-RT
scheduling modes.
