Though this has already been mentioned, I thought I would send out a 
reminder.  The following net drivers are slated for removal "soon", in 
the next kernel version or so:
1) iphase (iph5526 a.k.a. drivers/net/fc/*)
Been broken since 2.3 or 2.4.  Only janitors have kept it compiling.
2) xircom_tulip_cb
Unmaintained, and does not work for all xircom 32bit cards.  xircom_cb, 
on the other hand, works for ALL xircom 32bit cards.
3) eepro100
Unmaintained; users should use e100.
When I last mentioned eepro100 was going away, I got a few private 
emails saying complaining about issues not yet taken care of in e100. 
eepro100 will not be removed until these issues are resolved.
