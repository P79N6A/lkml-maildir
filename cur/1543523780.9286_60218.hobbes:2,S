I'm resolving hostnames.  Basically I send a hostname through the pipe and
get an ip address back.  It saves me from having to reimplement all the
gethostbyname complications.  I need to link to libc, so I must do it in
userland.  What I want is to be able to detect that some one has blown away
my deamon (with a kill -9) and recover.
