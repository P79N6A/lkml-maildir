Subject: BUG: 2.6.3-rc1: No sound with nforce2 sound system

I have an nforce2 motherboard with the sound module snd_intel8x0.
I had no problem with sound with kernel 2.6.2-bk2.
But now, aplay doesn't work anymore, enemy-territory too.
Other programs like xmms, kde apps using arts, and play still works.
I get an error message with enemy-territory :
> /dev/dsp: Input/output error
> Could not mmap /dev/dsp
