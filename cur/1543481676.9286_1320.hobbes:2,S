        In file genhd.c at line 205 is eternal loop, which produce potential
    problems when we have record in partition table, pointed at yourself. In this
    case kernel hangs while booting.
        All this work in stable and development kernels, and seems to be in
    long awaited 2.2.0. :(
Yes. Did you encounter this in real life?
Of course a fix would be trivial. Say
