The user-mode port of 2.4.0-test7 is available.
It's been updated to 2.4.0-test7.
A build bug which caused symbols not to be exported from arch/um/kernel has 
been fixed.
The debugging options are now configurable.
My ALS paper on this port has been posted on the project web site at
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/als2000/index.html
 (HTML) and
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/als2000.tex
 (TeX).
All the downloads except the Red Hat package have been updated.  I'm doing 
some work on the mkrootfs script, and it will be updated when that's done.
The project's home page is
