(Not the same issue, but interesting still, and its related)
Isn't this (
http://www.lowth.com/cutter/
) an application on the same
lines ? (but from the perspective of a person ON one of the two endpoint
machines, rather than a remote third party).

There is a feature of the TCP/IP protocol that we could use to good
effect here :- If a packet (other than an RST) is received on a
connection that has the wrong sequence number, then the host responds by
sending a corrective "ACK" packet back. This "ACK" reply is designed to
put the sequence numbers at both ends back into step - and allows the
protocol to retransmit packets that got lost. This is very nice for our
needs - if the firewall sends a packet that is "correct" in all respects
except for the sequence number, then the host very helpfully tells us
what should have been used. We can then use this information to build
the RST packet that will abort the connection.
