Hmm, the old comment mentions 686A/B explicitly - seems that these old
chips also use PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE to control interrupt routing.  Is it
correct to ignore them here?  Yes, that chips used PCI and not VLink,
but they also had an internal PIC (and even internal IO-APIC).
Unfortunately, I no longer have such hardware available.

8237 definitely uses PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE to control interrupt routing in
PIC mode - tested with the audio part by writing bogus values with
setpci and checking whether interrupts are delivered.

If there is no VIA ISA bridge in the system, this won't cache anything.
