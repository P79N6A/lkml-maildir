i stand corrected - lock ordering indeed is a problem, although i think
2.4 is much cleaner in this regard, we have less lock hierarchies, mainly
due to getting rid of much of the BKL.
i think another, natural debugging help here will be to make the UP kernel
preemptibe in 2.5. That will simulate most of the SMP locking scenarios on
UP as well, and we have much more UP users than SMP users.
