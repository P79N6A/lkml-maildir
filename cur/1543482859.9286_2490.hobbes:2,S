or it's implemented with something like lshell which is called in place of
your standard shell.  lshell sets limits according to your configuration
then launches the expected user shell.
resource limits don't exist only in the shell.  the most commonly found
implementation exists in your shell's binary.  the 'not builtin' method
simply sets the limits before your shell get's executed.  you can do
likewise at any point in such a chain.
but we digress.  the problem has been solved.  how 'bout we talk about why
GRE tunneling is kinda broken ;)
i need to grab some tcpdumps and start poking at that bug.
