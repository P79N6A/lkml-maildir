  Hello, Jens.
  As requested, I've regenerated dispatch queue and ordered patchset and 
will soon post 18 patches.  All patches are against the current master 
of linux-2.6-block:master (3d80636a0d5f056ffc26472d05b6027a7a9f6e1c).
patch #1	: fix-elevator_find.  remove try_module_get race in
		  elevator_find.
patch #2-6	: generic dispatch queue patchset.
patch #7	: reimplement-elevator-switch.  reimplements elevator
		  switch using generic dispatch queue.
patch #8-17	: ordered reimplementation patchset
  Patches should be applied in above order.  I proof-read changes and 
tested things to make sure changes made to the tree since the last 
posting doesn't break anything.  Well, it seems okay and works for me.
  Thanks.
