By the way, I'm almost certain that the COPYING file is the first, last
and only document specifying licence conditions, and nothing in that
prevents a proprietary driver from including a patch that, for example,
globally replaces ALL GPL-only symbols by the less restrictive ones.  In
fact, you'd be in a bit of strife down under if you tried to say
otherwise.  We've got quite strong consumer protection laws down here. 
You're just not allowed to claim additional licence conditions based on
source code commentary.
It's just games and hot air, isn't it?
