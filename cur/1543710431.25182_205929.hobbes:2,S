"using pte_chains for the extraordinary case" (which is a common case
for some apps) means it doesn't handle it, and you've to use rmap to
handle that case.

Do you realize the complexity of creating a tmpfs-inode and to attach
all vmas to it stacked on top of anonmm? And after you fix mremap you
get the same disavantages for merging of vmas (remeber my
disavantage of not merging after an mremap you won't merge too), plus it
wastes a lot more ram since you need a fake inode for every anonymous
vma and it's ugly to create those objects inside mremap. My transient
object is 8 bytes per group of vmas. And you need even the prio_tree
search on top of the anonmm.
Don't forget you can't re-use the vma->shared for doing the tmpfs-style
thing, that's already in a true inode. so what you're suggesting would
becomes an huge mess to implement IMHO. the anon_vma sounds a lot
cleaner and more efficient design to me than stacking inode-like objects
on top of a vma already queued in a i_mmap.

you're right about vma_split, the way I implemented it is wrong,
basically the as.vma/PageDirect idea is falling apart with vma_split.
I should simply allocate the anon_vma without passing through the direct
mode, that will fix it though it'll be a bit less efficient for the
first page fault in an anonymous vma (only the first one, for all the
other page faults it'll be as fast as the direct mode).
this is probably why the code was not stable yet btw ;) so I greatly
appreciate your comments about it, it's just the optimization I did that
was invalid.
I could retain the optimization with a list of pages attached to the vma
but it doesn't worth it, allocating the anon_vma is way too cheap
compared to that. the pagedirect was a microoptization only, any
additional complexity to retain the microoptimization is worthless.

the only real argument is mremap, your tmpfs-like thing is overkill
compared to anon_vma, and secondly I don't need the prio_tree to scale.
