This is potentially becoming a FAQ...  I ran into this too, as did 
several people in the office.  People who compile custom kernels seem to 
run into this when they first jump into 2.5.x.  AT Keyboard support is 
definitely buried :/
Unfortunately I don't have any concrete suggestions for Vojtech (input 
subsystem maintainer), just a request that it becomes easier and more 
obvious how to configure the keyboard and mouse that is found on > 90% 
of all Linux users computers [IMO]...
