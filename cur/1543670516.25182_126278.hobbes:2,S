Whan I last looked at the ide-tape driver  , which was
back in 2.2, it looked like the big problem was actually 
in it error handling , rather than anywhere else.
I don't think it has been changed significantly it that regard
since.
IIRC , the behaviour which appeared to be caueing me a problem
was that some slow driver would be busy long for ide-tape to
get bored. It also didn;t like getting error codes which weren't
spelled out it the quik spec. The common travan mechanism I
get lots of here, spits out quite a few of those. (As well
as failing one of st's enquiry cmds).
