With CONFIG_PREEMPT, this will still cause trouble due to lack
of "current" task info on the NDIS stack.
One option is to copy (duplicate) the bottom-of-stack info when
switching to the NDIS stack.
Another option is to stick a Mutex around any use of the NDIS stack
when calling into the foreign driver (might be done like this already??),
which will prevent PREEMPTion during the call.
Cheers
