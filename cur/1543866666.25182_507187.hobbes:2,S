I know, but I agree with the argument that having a driver without the
suspend/resume support is better than not having the driver at all.
Moreover, if you _know_ which of the drivers you use have no suspend/resume
support, usually you _can_ suspend (at least to disk) and resume anyway - you
only need to unload their modules before the suspend.  Of course, this is not
true for the disk (and related) drivers and for the drivers that cannot be
unloaded.  [I think it generally is not true for the suspend-to-RAM either.]
Also, I think there are quite some drivers already in the tree that don't
support suspend/resume explicitly and honestly we should start from adding the
suspend/resume routines to these drivers _before_ we ban new drivers like that.

Well, maybe.
Still, I'd like to create standard debugging procedures for suspend/resume, so
that if someone reports a problem, we can tell him exactly what to do next.
From this point of view, the idea of having warnings related to the lack of
.suspend or .resume routines in drivers that will appear in the user's dmesg in
the test mode seems to be a good one. ;-)
Greetings,
Rafael
