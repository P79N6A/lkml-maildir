Anything that does disk access delays prefetch fine. Things that only do heavy 
cpu do not delay prefetch. Anything reading from disk will be noticeable 
during 3d gaming.

I can't distinguish between when cpu activity is important (game) and when it 
is not (compile), and assuming worst case scenario and not doing any swap 
prefetching is my intent. I could add cpu accounting to prefetch_suitable() 
instead, but that gets rather messy and yielding achieves the same endpoint.
