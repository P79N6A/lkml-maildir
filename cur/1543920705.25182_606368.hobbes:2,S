Wouldn't "Change Loglevel to this value" be more consistent with other
descriptions?
Or maybe even "Change Kernel Loglevel to <value>"; the repeated "this
value" seems somewhat silly.

This is not very descriptive. Maybe "Immediate System Reboot"?

Most descriptions are capitalized. So for consistency this should be
"Trigger a Crashdump". (Although my personal preference would be to drop
the capitalization for all descriptions.)

Should "Regs" be expanded to "Registers"?

For consistency: "Set Keyboard Mode to XLATE"
