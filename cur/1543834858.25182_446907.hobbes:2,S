I don't know.
The klive data might be inaccurate in any direction.
In this case I'd suspect an inaccuraty in one specific direction.

Size isn't everything.
The problem is getting an accurate sample of data.
Let me try to make the problem clearer by making an example:
Consider you want to know the ratio between housewifes and women with a 
job for women aged between 30 and 40.
Consider you get your data by asking women in shopping malls between
10 and 11 o'clock in the morning on workdays.
Do you understand why the result might be quite different from the 
actual ratio?
Do you understand why asking a million women in shopping malls between
10 and 11 o'clock in the morning on workdays wouldn't make the data
better?
And do you know the Linux Counter at [1]?
I remember several years ago Debian had some default setting in 
some package to send reports there.
smail was at that times the default Debian MTA, and therefore also the 
most popular MTA at the Linux counter...

Please read carefully what I said.
I did NOT say:
"All Gentoo users are freaks."
It was more (implicitely) in the direction:
"Many freaks use Gentoo."
The latter is IMHO not that far from reality.
And "freak" wasn't meant negative.

The majority of user will use the filesystem their distribution offers 
as default, no matter what people living on the edge today will use...
