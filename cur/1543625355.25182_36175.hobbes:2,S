Fair enough - I don't see any technical
reasons why alsa *couldn't* perform as
well, latency wise, as oss.

Some folks on this list had been doing latency
profiling on their kernels during the past year
(sorry, I don't remember the exact dates) and
surprisingly the alsa driver was showing up
as one of the top sources of latency - IIRC one
possible explanation was "in-kernel mixing".

Thanks for the feedback, I'll have to do some
testing of my own and see what the situation
is at this point - I'd be very happy to learn that
my concerns are outdated and already resolved.
