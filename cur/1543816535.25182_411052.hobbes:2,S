Yes
There are several chunks of work needed. Firstly was to resync with the
libata development tree which is now done. The second to push changes to
the core code neccessary to support the PATA drivers. This is about
2/3rd done (Tejun Ho has been doing lots of work on mode changes which
also meant chunks of it were not needed).
Of the other bits that need merging some need resubmits/tidying and
oddments noted/requested by Jeff fixing. At that point it should be
possible just to drop in drivers during 2.6.17 development.
The final hard bit will be the PIIX/ICH driver as this is a major update
to a critical driver used by very many SATA people rather than a new
driver, so has the highest risk of breaking stuff.
