Hello All
            I am forwarding one more improved patch related with fork
bombing attack. I have used printk_ratelimit function in my patch
and it works rellly well. it prints message as per printk_ratelimit
values stored in /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit
and /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit_burst.
root can set printk_ratelimit values(such as how many times message
should be repeated ,after how much time message should repeat) by
making changes in the above 2 mentioned files.
       this patch will never flood syslog anymore and will definitely
help administrator by informing him about fork bombing attack.
        added comments will help developers.
Regards,
Anand
