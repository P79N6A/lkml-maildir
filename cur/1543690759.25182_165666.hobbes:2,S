After working on this some more this afternoon, I realize now that 
it's much better to have the typechecking in place than not, even for 
userspace. Maybe the best solution is to still leave the typechecking 
(don't wrap it in #ifdef __KERNEL__), and just
#ifdef size_t
extern size_t __invalid_size_argument_for_IOC;
#else
extern unsigned int __invalid_size_argument_for_IOC;
#endif
Would the type specification of this non-existent variable ever 
actually effect the generated code? If not, then even putting this 
#ifdef in is overkill.
