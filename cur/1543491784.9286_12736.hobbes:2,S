That's just fine, but it misses the point.  
In a capabilities world, I would want named to be suid to a non-root
user, so that I can make sure that only that user has write access to
the secondary zone files, for example.  I would _also_ want named to
have the bind-to-privileged-socket capability.  If capability granting
is enabled by overloading suid-root, then I cannot grant capabilities at
the same time as I suid to a non-root user.
And that is a problem.
