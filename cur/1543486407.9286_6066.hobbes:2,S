Sometimes big swap helps but NOT ALWAYS. I was unable to set up RedHat 4.2
on comp with 11MiB RAM and 1GiB HDD even with 128MiB swap but with 31MiB
all was just fine without any swap :-(( Plus your "rule-of-thumb" will give
us 144MiB for 36GiB "drive" and there are 256MiB REAL memory ! IMO it's some
rare race in kernel triggered by mkfs.ext2 when there are a lot of dirty
pages in cache but they are not written on disk and so you could not allocate
memory even of there are plenty of swap area...
