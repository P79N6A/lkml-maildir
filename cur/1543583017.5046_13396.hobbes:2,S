Verrry odd.  I can see why you were suspecting a cache.
I'm probably going to have to palm this off to Trond, the NFS client
maintainer (are you listening Trond?) but could please confirm that
from the client you can:
 1/ ping server
 2/ rpcinfo -p server
 3/ showmount -e server
 4/ mount server:/exported/filesys /some/other/mount/point
If all of these work, them I am mistified.  If one of these fails,
then that might point the way to further investigation.
