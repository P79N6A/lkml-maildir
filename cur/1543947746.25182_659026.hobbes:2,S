I still believe this this could be done for embedded devices which are usually booted
via wrapper or U-Boot as those devices will most probably use the most exotic I2c devices
out there (e.g. home-grown devices used by stbs). However, I'm not an device tree expert.

I could think of a mixture between 2. and 3.:
Using the compatible attribute with the manufacturer stripped off as I2c name by default
and using an exception table. For now, the struct i2c_driver_device would currently only
need one entry ("dallas,ds1374", "rtc-ds1374").
Thanks,
