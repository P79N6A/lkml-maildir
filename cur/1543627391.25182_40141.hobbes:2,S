A single 1000Mhz+ CPU is overkill for most desktop users.
Most medium to large workplaces are vast cubicle farms.  Put
one box at the intersection of 4 cubes...bingo 2meter VGA
cables reach fine and you get 1/4th the maintenance, 1/4 the
network drops, etc.  This would even be advantagious for two desks
side-by-side or back-to-back.
