Dax,
Provo Utah, 4th Judicial District Court.  Area code 801-429-1000,  Ask for
Judge Schofield's Clerk (Mary).  Ask for Exhibit 9 to Merkey's First Motion
for Snactions, filed August 1997.  If she tells you it is under seal and she
refuses to give it to you, then you can contact us for a copy, or you can
file a motion to intervene and stipluation to the protective order of the
court, and you can get it, or you can get it from the press folks who have
it.  If you get it from us, it's not public, and is under the terms of the
settlement.  If you get it from them, then you can post it.  There is a
charge for getting you copies of the documents (10 cents per page).  Try to
get Mary to provide you with a copy.  Tell her you may be one of the persons
named in it who was potentilly harmed by it.
Jeff
