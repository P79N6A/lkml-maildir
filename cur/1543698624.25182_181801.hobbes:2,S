Marcelo,
2.4.23-bk has a changeset (post 2.4.23 release TAG) that makes edd not
compile as Meelis Roos already reported:

Further, looking at the header files the closest constant that does exist
is #define DISK80_SIG_BUFFER 0x228 from include/asm-i386/edd.h.
However, changing DISKSIG_BUFFER to DISK80_SIG_BUFFER causes the kernel to
reboot the computer as soon as it starts booting.  Basically I select it
in grub and the screen changes graphics mode and by the time it has
finished the switch the computer reboots.
2.4.23-bk at the 2.4.23 release TAG works fine and compiles fine with the
same .config.
Best regards,
	Anton
