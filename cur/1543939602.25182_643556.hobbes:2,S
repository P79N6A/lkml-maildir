My wish is that distros would just boot without requiring an initrd. I
know how to make them for redhat and debian based distros, but the fact
that you can't (easily) cross-build them makes it a very tedious
construct.
I can butcher the distros into booting and ignore the errors on bootup
that whine that modules are missing, but really.
