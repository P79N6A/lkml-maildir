Yes. I think what to want to do is same between bonding.c and veth
(link aggregation).  But veth has link aggretation maintenance
functionality(LACP) and TCP/UDP port number based distributing
algorithm. Of course, such things are optional features...
On the other hand, purpose of lr(link redundancy) is different of
yours and veth. It's a new link redundant technology rather than
aggregation.
By the way, it seems that your code don't have incoming packet handler
code, right? My drivers contains packet handler for incoming
packets. If your incoming packet handling method is better than mine,
I'd like to follow it. (I'm not sure its method yet.)
