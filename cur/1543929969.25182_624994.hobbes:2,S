Sure, no problem.  I vacillated on this order myself.

It's not obvious to me that "can't be interrupted by a signal" is the
same thing as "contributes to loadavg".  Indeed, I think we would all
like to see a day where there's no such thing as an uninterruptible sleep,
but we'll still want at least some of those tasks contributing to loadavg.
You're right that task_is_loadavg() doesn't make much sense.
task_contributes_to_load() is a better name, but only marginally.
I've considered task_performing_io(), and name the corresponding bit
__TASK_PERFORMING_IO (or even just __TASK_DOING_IO or __TASK_IO), but
it's not just doing IO that makes a task contribute to loadavg.
I have no good suggestions here ;-(
