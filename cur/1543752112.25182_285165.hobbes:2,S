I'm very happy with current swsusp, that's stable for me. 
 2.6.10-mm1 + ppc patch from 
  
http://honk.physik.uni-konstanz.de/~agx/linux-ppc/kernel/
 + your free some memory patch
I using it for a week, never failed, never oops. :)
The only problem is relocating a little slowly.
Now I don't think non-continuous pagedir is really need. Anyway I'll
prepare a patch to make swsusp using non-continuous pagedir.
any comments.
