  Agreed  that would be the best. But how much time and effort will it
  be,  and  how much of the original ideas would be lost on the way to
  implement  them  in  the  VFS? Especially with new and very advanced
  FS's like Reiser4.
  Isn't  the  line  between the actual file system and the virtual one
  very hair thin? Where would the separation lay in Reiser4?
