Bug reporters and patch submitters shouldn't be required to CC too many
addresses.

Yes, patch review is always done on the mailing list(s).  Not only
during the initial submission, but also for all later changes.
A git repository provided by you could be used
  - by interested people to fetch your pre-integrated development
    sources,
  - by Andrew Morton to pull into -mm.  This needs to be a branch in
    your repo which only contains stuff which works to the best of your
    knowledge, i.e. is already tested and got at least some basic review
    by those involved in the subproject.  It always has to give a clean
    and working diff against Linus' current tree, because that's what
    Andrew bases -mm on.  (This means you have to rebase or otherwise
    update this branch whenever there were conflicting changes in Linus'
    tree.)  Also, if you need to do changes outside your subsystem,
    coordinate it with the tree owners of the other subsystems to
    minimize conflicts when Andrew assembles -mm.
    Alternatively to git, you could also work with Andrew via a quilt
    tree or via e-mail, depending on what turns out as most effective.
  - by Linus to pull into his tree if he thinks he can work with your
    tree better than via e-mail.  Regardless if git or e-mail, you are
    of course supposed to only offer stuff to Linus which is known to
    work and has been fully reviewed.
    New work (feature additions or removals, refactoring, intrusive bug
    fixes) needs to be sent to Linus early before an -rc1 release.
    Between -rc1 and -final, only bug fixes are acceptable.  (In early
    -rc's maybe also a few other small nonintrusive changes that can't
    possibly break anything...)
Note, everything which I said here only reflects what I remember as
required or most desirable; it's not a canonical list of requirements.
Anyway, it may be a little bit too early to think about those things
before you posted your initial submission for review and re-review...
