The worst thing is that gnu patch will make
this decision on a per-file basis, so you
can't then back out the changes with -R.
Do like this:
diff -Naurd old new
IMPORTANT: the directory names should have
the same number of characters in them.
Do not try something like:
diff -Naurd bad idea
diff -Naurd doomed 2fail
Don't use "linux" for a name. Don't use
anything Linus might use. Pick your own
equal-length directory names, and don't
distribute tarballs containing them.
This prevents source-destroying disasters.
Then to apply:
(cd my-linux && bzip2 -dc ../foo.bz2 | patch -p1 -s -E)
