Please try s2ram (

).

This one is on the s2ram whitelist, should work.

This might work with "s2ram -f --vbe_post --vbe_save", please try.

Please apply the patches 01-11 from:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.24/patches/
on top of 2.6.24, compile the kernel and install it.  After booting, please do:
# echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
# echo mem > /sys/power/state
and see if the boxes survive it (this causes the suspend/resume sequence to
be executed without acutally suspending, but busy-waiting for 5 sec. instead).
Greetings,
Rafael
