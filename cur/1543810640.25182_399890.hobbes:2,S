It would limit you to the 3GB addressable memory space. You couldn't write files
bigger than that, so it's not just a coding thing :)

As of my understanding, mmap and send() would take approximately the same amount
of cpu time as sendfile() does.

Do you transfer the padding at the end of subbuffers or do you truncate it ?
Currently, my ioctl()+lttd does not tell the size of the padding, but it would
be very simple to add this output parameter to the reserve subbuf ioctl. It
would be particularly useful to reduce the network traffic on almost empty
subbuffers. As the majority of subbuffers are almost full on a heavily used
system, I doubt it would be useful at all to know the padding size in the
disk/network writer daemon.

How would you like having both mmap+ioctl() and sendfile() added to standard
RelayFS file operations ? This would make both disk write and network send quite
simple and efficient.
However, I would tweak the sendfile() operation a little bit : I would make it
use the current consumer position and only send the number of subbuffers that
are ready for being read. It would then support more than one subbuffer per
channel.

You are right : the sendfile approach needs less checking of the copied memory
region, so there should be a gain.

The LTTng code is available at 
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
. The major part the
timekeeping sits in the include/asm-*/ltt.h. Note that there is a small detail
about it : I need to reset the logical clock at each jiffy increment (for
architectures without TSC).
