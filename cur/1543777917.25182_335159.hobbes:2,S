Found that now:
	psmouse->dev.id.product = psmouse->type;
So the type is visible through the input device interface.  Probably this
should be mentioned in a comment near "enum psmouse_type" - its definition
in drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.h looks just like some driver-internal
enum.

At least the Synaptics protocol description mentions that its 6-byte
protocol was designed to look like two 3-byte PS/2 mouse packets, so that
it would work even if the controller looks at those markers; other such
protocols are likely to have the same property for the same reason.  Now,
if the Synaptics touchpad would be able to accept a 6-byte packet from the
pass-thru port as two 3-byte packets...
