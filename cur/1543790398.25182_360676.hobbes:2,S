  Ingo - I think you broke the sparc defconfig build with this.
I am seeing the sparc defconfig (crosstool) build broken with 2.6.14-rc5-mm1.
It built ok with 2.6.14-rc4-mm1.
This build now fails for me, with:

Your patch added:

I see __raw_write_unlock defined in include/asm-sparc/spinlock.h, which
is not included in defconfig sparc builds because such builds are non-
debug UP builds.
