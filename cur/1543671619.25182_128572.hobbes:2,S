Newton had a lot of rather unique ideas he never published.. But in his
time no one did own information. ;)
And to those people who are so terribly afraid of being "ripped-off" I can
only say that every poet, every programmer, every human being is a theif
in that sense. If they are afraid that other people will take their ideas
and make money of it - just put it under the GPL? ;)
Could you be a bit more elaborative when it comes to the term "ripped
off"?
