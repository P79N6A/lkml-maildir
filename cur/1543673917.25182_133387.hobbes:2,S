rmb() is safe on the read side.  In fact, The mb()s only need to be
smp_rmb()s and the wmb()s only need to be smp_wmb()s.
Also, the mb() after the spin_lock(&mm->page_table_lock);
is not even needed since spin_lock() acts as a memory barrier.
Why do you feel you need the mb()?
Isn't everything the reader might do protected already?
You just using the sequence value to know whether you should
cleanup and retry.
Also, I like using the seqlock.h approach since it gives consistent
use of sequence locks, is a bit more readable, and documents and hides
all the memory barrier stuff.
Is there any possibility that the truncate side can run faster than
the reader side?
