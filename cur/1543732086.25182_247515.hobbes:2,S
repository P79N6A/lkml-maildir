It buys me caching. I do quite often
bzcat patch.2.6.8.bz2 | less (read the patch)
(sometimes repeat that few times because I hit ^c when I should not
have etc).
cd ...clean; bzcat patch.2.6.8.bz2 | patch -Esp1
cd ...linux; bzcat patch.2.6.8.bz2 | patch -Esp1
Now... that's total waste of cpu. bzip2 decompression takes quite some
time. 
I could do
bzcat patch.2.6.8.bz2 > /tmp/delete.me.when.you.are.done
...but I'd probably forget to delete that one and anyway, it requires
me to think about it. Nicest way would be
cat patch.2.6.8.bz2/ubz | less
cd ...clean; cat patch.2.6.8.bz2/ubz | patch -Esp1
cd ...linux; cat patch.2.6.8.bz2/ubz | patch -Esp1
with kernel intelligently caching uncompressed data. I believe this
can not be done completely in userspace.
