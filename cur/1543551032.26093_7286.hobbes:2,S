I could not agree more. Normally, you'd better kill a foreground task
(running nice 0) than selecting one of those background jobs for some
reasons:
* The foreground job can be restarted by the interactive user
  (Most likely, it will be only netscape anyway)
* The background job probably is the more useful one which has been running
  since a longer time (computations, ...)
* If we put any policy like this into the kernel at all, I'd rather
  encourage the usage of nice instead of discouraging it.
I assume here backgrd job == niced job, which mostly is the case in reality.
