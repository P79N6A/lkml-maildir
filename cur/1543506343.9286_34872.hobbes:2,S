It matters because of I can pass return value from ioremap() also to
memcpy_{from,to}io and check_signature. check_signature is almost dead,
but memcpy_{from,to}io (if guaranteed transfer widths) is useful on
some archs with complicated readb code. And check_signature requires
long, but memcpy_toio on sparc64 pointer.

I'm doing this in matroxfb (having u_int8_t* base). Unfortunately,
compiler is not happy from this sometime and adds base.base and offset
together again and again in subsequent writeb although they do not change
(and both are stored in registers, i386). On other side, you do not have
to pass address to readb - you can pass device region identification
too (if hardware does not map devices directly to physical address space).
