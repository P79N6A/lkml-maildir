Sorry. Indeed, it differs very much from the normal packet log and 
cannot be obtained by truncation:
Aug 20 13:25:39 dsa kernel: packet trace: IN=eth0 OUT=eth2 
SRC=192.168.0.96 DST=192.36.143.150 LEN=76 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63

None of the results of grep -r 'L=%' linux-2.6.22.1 match your string. 
So this must indeed be something out-of-tree - but Xen-3.1.0 or 3.0.4 
doesn't match either. Or function that produced this message in the log 
doesn't use printf-like functions for formatting numbers.
However, the style does look similar to a message in ipw2100.c:
IPW_DEBUG_TX("TX%d V=%p P=%04X T=%04X L=%d\n", i,
              &txq->drv[i],
              (u32) (txq->nic + i * sizeof(struct ipw2100_bd)),
              txq->drv[i].host_addr, txq->drv[i].buf_length);
