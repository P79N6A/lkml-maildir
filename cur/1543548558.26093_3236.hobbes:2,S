Ted,
I am looking at these sources as well.  One thing I went back and looked
at was related to a comment from Mike G. I believe regarding drivers
conflicts with int 0x13 requests potentially hosing the IDE driver.  In
MANOS, since DOS is resident underneath the OS, I instrumented the code
a lot like was done in earlier versions of Windows and NT.  I hook the
MSDOS disk interrupts and reprogram the PIC to move the first PIC
interrupt mappings to start at entry 0x28 
in the IDT tables instead of overlaying the first 16 exception entries
which is how DOS leaves them by default.  When I call into DOS, I
restore the previous PIC1 mappings to their previous DOS settings and
restore the DOS IVT to allow the DOS BIOS drivers to service the disk. 
In the MANOS case, DOS has enough smarts to reset the IDE chipset to
it's default values.  I am looking  over the BIOS int 0x13 code, and it
looks like it may be possible to co-host an int 0x13 ext2 driver and the
Linux IDE driver as is done in NetWare today.  I know this is possible
because I do it in MANOS now, and NetWare also supports mutiple IDE
drivers (DOS and NetWare) to share the chipset.
:-)
