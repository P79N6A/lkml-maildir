PS: after checking uipc_syscall.c it looks like they can't distinguish
between the different dup()'d copies for recvfrom() too - not until the
->pru_soreceive() returns.
And that's -CURRENT, so I really wonder whether the thing is done in the
kernel at all - I don't think that they went for such a violation of
normal UNIX semantics. close(dup(fd)) should have _no_ effect. POSIX locks
violate that rule, but that's one of the best reasons to avoid them like a
plague. Breaking it for read(2)... <shudder>
