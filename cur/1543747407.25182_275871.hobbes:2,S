(I looked 2.6.10-rc1-mm3.)
At first crash_machine_kexec() should be called before bust_spinlock(0)
in the panic() function :-)
In disable_IO_APIC() (this is called from crash_dump_stop_cpus())
spin_lock_irqsave(&ioapic_lock, flags) is required. It may be cause
a deadlock. (The other CPU may be stoped with this lock hold.)
It seems no lock required except the point mentioned above from
crash_machine_kexec called to jumping the new kernel. I feel it is
fine.
(BTW. The disconnect_bsp_APIC() in the crash_dump_stop_cpus() 
 is called twice if both CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC and CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
 are set. The code is beter as follows.
#if defined(CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC)
        disable_IO_APIC();
#elif defined(CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC)
        disconnect_bsp_APIC();
#endif
)
Thank you.
