Thank you very much. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to have had any
effect, as far as I can see:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
/proc/mtrr:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=983552MB: write-back, count=1
/var/log/syslog:
Sep 12 10:09:10 localhost kernel: mtrr: type mismatch for
e8000000,8000000 old: write-back new: write-combining
/var/log/Xorg.0.log
(WW) RADEON(0): Failed to set up write-combining range (0xe8000000,0x8000000)
