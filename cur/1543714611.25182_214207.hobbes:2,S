There is a problem regarding the C standard. The semantics of 'void *' are well defined
and only allow for limited use. Basically, you can cast any pointer to and from 'void *',
but nothing else.
Pointer math says that 'p+n' means "add to 'p' the value 'n*s' where 's' is the size
on the element that 'p' points to". A 'void *' does not have a defined element size
until it is cast. So, ANSI specifically does not allow any arithmetics on 'void *'.
Some compilers are forgiving and will invent an element size of '1' and allow the
math. We should not rely on such improper usage.

It will not simply 'fix' the problem, this is one case where a cast is not
a bad thing (i.e. a cheat) but the correct thing to do.
