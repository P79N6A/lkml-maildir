Some of the initialization can definitely be done in parallel, but there
are all sorts of special cases, like devices which turn off interrupts
during init (IDE), and other fun tricks...  Some of the delays during
init are timing sensitive, where you don't want to have to wait for the
tasklet to be called for completion.
