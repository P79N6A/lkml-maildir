Hello!
I've recently installed FreeBSD on my linux box, and it appears that
somewhere between 2.1.125 and 2.2.0-pre6 additional checks were added to
genhd.c to test for 
overlaps between BSD partitions inside a slice and other partitions.
Unfortunately those checks were broken and compared BSD partitions on a
certain disk with linux partitions on first (which is not necessarily
the same) disk on the same major number (e.g. BSD partitions inside
/dev/hdb2 (my BSD slice) were compared with partitions on /dev/hda).
Thus, depending on layout of the disk on minor, 0 BSD partitions on
other disks could be wrongly recognized as bad.
Patch against 2.2.0-final included.
