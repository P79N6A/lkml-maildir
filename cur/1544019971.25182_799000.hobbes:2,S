343/363 don't work unless you use the alternate access via the BAR4
register range and leave BAR0-3 alone. That means you can't use the
standard IDE setup helper logic with them.
366 and later (which is almost certainly what you will have) replace this
with a different collection of errata which are handled by both sets of
drivers.
