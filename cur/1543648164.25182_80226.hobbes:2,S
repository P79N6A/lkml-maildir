refill_inactive_zone stuck circling the one-page active_list with
lru_lock and interrupts disabled, if concurrent release_pages has
done its put_page_testzero and is now spinning for that lru_lock.
(I haven't done a patch for include/linux/pagevec.h, but when working
on this freeze, I noticed that pagevec_add becomes rather unfriendly
once you get into NMIs and BUGs - overshoots PAGEVEC_SIZE and corrupts
beyond.  Perhaps you'd say all bets are off then anyway, or perhaps
pagevec_space should be signed, and tested before rather than after?)
