yes.

No. We also need to be sure that ".k = k" is updated by the moment we
check for a state of the task in try_to_wake_up(), so that's write vs.
read ops.
The point is that a 'kthread' loop does :
(1) set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
(2) check for .k == k
and kthread_stop() must do it in the _reverse_ order:
(1) .k = k
(2) check for a task state and wakeup if necessary.
Only this way we ensure that a wakeup is not lost.

Yes, I'll try to come up with a better description.
