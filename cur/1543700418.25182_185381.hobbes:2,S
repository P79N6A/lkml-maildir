Nopes, I get the kernel panic before the driver loads or when it does,
however I'm not seeing any ataraid driver message at all. This is really
strange I think. The only thing that has changed in my setup are the
harddrives. I really need to get this working. Do you have any suggestions
what-so-ever what to do? I really appreciate your help on this.

Hmmm. I'm pretty sure that the partitions are enumerated the same way in
2.4.23 vs. 2.4.18.  There was a change in the way IDE geometry was returned
from the kernel that caused a hiccup in the pdcraid driver around 2.4.22 I
think?  My patch just tells the pdcraid to use an alternate method of
finding the RAID superblock on each drive. Not sure what else might be the
problem. Do you see the ataraid driver fire up (looking something like
this):
ataraid/d0: ataraid/d0p1
Drive 0 is 239372 Mb (33 / 0)
Drive 1 is 239372 Mb (34 / 0)
Raid1 array consists of 2 drives.
Promise Fasttrak(tm) Softwareraid driver for linux version 0.03beta
The only problem I've recently come upon with pdcraid, is when it detects
just one of the drives and fails. I didn't think that should happen with
raid1 though.
