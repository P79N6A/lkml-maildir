It's not possible (as long as you don't use multiple threads at least)

It's is guaranteed. A signal handler is really like a private interrupt,
not a special thread.

Yes.

It's ok, but you don't really need to spin. A flag is enough. Also you
could use the signal blocking function (sigprocmask), but they're slightly
more expensive than just setting a flag.
