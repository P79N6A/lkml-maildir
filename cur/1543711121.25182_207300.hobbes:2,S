Well, that's certainly a lot slower ;-)  I've got a direct_read_under
round going.  While you're at it, there's one more bug.
The wbc struct used by filemap_fdatawrite doesn't initialize
wbc.nonblocking to zero.  stack magic might give us a 1 there, leading
to an early exit from mpage_writepages even when doing a WB_SYNC_ALL.
