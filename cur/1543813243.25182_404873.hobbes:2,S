Ok, so I'll just send an updated patch against linux-2.6.git adressing your
issues later.

Ok, will do.

Because outside dcache_lock, either the refcount on the parent dentry is wrong
(therefore select_parent() might return 0) and sb_prunes != 0 or the refcount
is correct and the sb_prunes == 0. Since sb_root == NULL when unmounting the
filesystem there are no new dentries coming in.

I'll update the comments and come back to you with an updated patch. Then I'm
fine with the patch.
