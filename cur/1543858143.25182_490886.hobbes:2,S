Hi Oliver,
Thanks a lot for reading my code, I didn't even hope that someone would! 
I've corrected the copy_to_user (and copy_from_user) code. However I 
don't know how to do locking for the concurrent ioctls. Indeed, I don't 
think there is anything preventing two programs to call the driver at 
the same time. Unfortunately, I've got no idea how to do the locking and 
surprisingly couldn't find any ioctl code in the kernel doing locking. 
Maybe I've just not looked at the right place, could you give a me some 
hint how to do locking for ioctl's ?
See you,
Eric
