I think it doesn't make sense for fairness.
IMHO, this functionality is an unfair one in nature. While someone is
reclaiming pages, other processes can get a newly reclaimed page without
calling try_to_free_page.
For high-priority processes, 
1. avoiding diving into try_to_free_pages if it's congested.
2. just waiting for that someone relcaim pages and grab it ASAP
maybe good for quick work. 
Thanks,
