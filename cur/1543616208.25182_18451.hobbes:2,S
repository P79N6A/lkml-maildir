Subject: [PATCH] IDE patches for 2.4.18-pre2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi LKML,
I have rediffed Andre's IDE patch (ide.2.4.16.12102001.patch) against 
2.4.18-pre2 and the result is available here:
         
http://www-stu.christs.cam.ac.uk/~aia21/linux/ide.2.4.18-pre2.12102001.patch
The original patch no longer applies cleanly hence this rediff. There was 
only one chunk which failed but was trivially fixable.
My file server is running with this patch now. Fingers crossed the ide 
subsystem which hosts multiple IDE RAID-0 arrays will survive longer than 
the less than 24hrs which it usually survives without the patch...
Best regards,
Anton
