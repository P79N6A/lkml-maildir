David,
I'm glad you performed a thorough analysis of how I use BK prior
to commenting.  I think that if you look here, I put more information
into BK than most people.  Considering that it was only recently that
the Linux community decided that revision control was a good thing
and revision information was routinely "lost" on the push to Marcelo
or Linus, I don't see why everyone is being so critical:
http://linux-scsi.bkbits.net:8080/scsi-aic7xxx-2.5/cset@1.865.2.6?nav=index
.html|ChangeSet@-1d
And yes, this changeset was created *before* this thread even started.
