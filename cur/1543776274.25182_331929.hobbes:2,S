That commit is still going.  I can see why subversion was not used for
kernel development.

It did the trick.  I got a network. But I also got a hell of a lot of
'enqueued dead tasks'. But stupid me forgot to turn on capture in minicom,
and haven't been able to reproduce the problem. I rebooted the machine
which blew away all evidence of what occured, and it's now fine. I'll
reboot a few more times to see if I can get it to break again.
