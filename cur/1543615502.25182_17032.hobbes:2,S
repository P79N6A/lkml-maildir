On all boxes I run currently (all 1GB or below RAM), I cannot find    
_major_ issues.

Must be beyond the GB range.

I have not had one up to now in everyday life with 2.4.17

Hm, well I would expect Andrea to do tuning and fixing as experience  
evolves...

Me = none up to now I could track down to a kernel issue. The single  
one I had was with a distro kernel around 2.4.10 and flaky hardware.

I am currently running 5 Asus CUV4X-D based SMP boxes all with apic   
_on_, amongst  which are squids, sql servers, workstation type setups 
(2 my very own).

These

Have you run _yourself_ into a problem with 2.4.17?                   
I mean it is not perfect of course, but it is far better than you make
it look.                                                              
I could hand the brown bag to all versions below about 2.4.15  pretty 
easy, but since 2.4.16 it has really become hard to shoot it down for 
me. Ok, I use only pretty selected hardware, but there are reasons I  
do, and they are not related to the kernel in first place.            
Regards,
