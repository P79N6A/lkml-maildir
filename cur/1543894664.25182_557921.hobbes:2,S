Fortunately the Law recognizes humans are not computers, natural
langage is not unambiguous binary code, so statements of intent *have*
legal value when a legal text is open to interpretations.
That's why ten-line law paragraphs are published with the hundreds of
pages of parliamentary discussions on them, which the judge will
consider if there's any doubt in his mind.
