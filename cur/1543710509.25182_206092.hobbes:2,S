I, too, have been experiencing this with ext3 on top of lvm on top of
raid5.  I also have a dual-proc machine.
It seems to be some sort of race condition because it is triggered by
multiple disk-io intensive processes using the same volume.  Many
mornings, when I first login to this machine which runs all of the
time, I find that one or more of the volumes is mounted read-only.
Sometimes e2fsck shows errors and sometimes it doesn't.
