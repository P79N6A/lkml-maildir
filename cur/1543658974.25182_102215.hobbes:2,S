The change I described recently that needs to be made to the floppy
driver (Changing "if (NO GEOM){" to "if (1) {" in floppy_revalidate() in
drivers/block/floppy.c) still has to happen in the latest kernel to fix
a problem where you try to open the floppy device without a disk in the
drive and the OS doesn't always tell you ENXIO..  It tells you every few
times ENXIO, but not every time...
The patch is above in my text...  It's simple to apply.. It's more
difficult, but if you want me to do a diff patch, I'll do it.
The patch will probably break something else, but it will at least fix
this issue, which someone else complained about.
