Just out of a need to know things :)
What compiler do Alan Cox and Linus use to create the 2.4 series
kernels?
I am currently using RedHat's compiler gcc-2.96-85 and have been told
not to do so because it "breaks things" .
So far it has not broken anything, but then again i am compiling kernels
for use on my RedHat Distributions.
The question would be .. how hard is it going to be for me to upgrade to
gcc 3 +  and  will i get any benefit from it?  WillI loose any
advantages that i currently do have?
Or can i still get what i need from compiling 2.4.12 or 2.4.13 with the
compiler I have now?
Thank you 
Madhav Diwan
