You have patches here which should strictly be merged by various
different subsystem trees.  That gets tricky because presumably there
are dependencies.
What _are_ the dependencies here?  Do patches 2-7 depend upon #1, perhaps?
If so, then one approach would be to merge the first patch into
mainline now then trickle the rest out into subsystem trees.
Or, with suitable acks, I can merge the lot.  Perhaps into 2.6.29..
