Back from holiday.
This kludge doesn't change any IDT behavior, so it is vulnerable to vector 
exhaustion too.  It just deals with large systems that have large I/O APICs.  
Since we are indexing irq_vectors by the sum of all available I/O APIC RTEs 
and not checking for overflow, we can get into trouble.
Some numbers:
* A 32-way x445 is made up of four 8-way chassis hooked together by 
scalability cables.
* Each Summit chassis has 2 I/O APICs with 50 RTEs per.  The BIOS guys are 
trying to help out by using some hardware to only use one I/O APIC for all 
but the boot chassis.
* Each RXE100 PCI expansion box contains one or two I/O APICs with 50 RTEs 
each.  Every chassis can have one RXE100.
Even without PCI expansion boxes, 5 * 50 == 250 which is > 224.  The kernel 
overflows irq_vectors and dies.
Since the value stuffed into irq_vectors is 0x31 to 0xF8, it easily fits into 
a byte.  As a quick kludge, I changed the type of irq_vectors and quadrupled 
the number.  With 896 elements in the array, the system survived and ran.
For a real fix, irq_vectors should be dynamically allocated.  But then, I 
should port the dynamic MAX_MP_BUSSES patch from 2.4 to 2.5 anyway....
