Dmitry,
Thanks for the explanation. That would mean that if
process is not put to sleep, it will go back to
top of for() loop in do_select(), set state back
to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and re-check for incoming data.

No, it's not going to sleep then.
The effect of schedule() being called with current->state ==
TASK_RUNNING is a re-scheduling to another task with a higher prio (if
any) or just getting back (iow, the task doesn't lose a cpu). For both
cases, the task is on the runqueue.
/ Look how/when deactivate_task() is called in schedule() /
Maybe there is a race in your code between (1) how you check "data is
available" in poll and (2) a part that sets this fact (data is
available)...
