That's ... really evil.

So their BIOS wrongly set irq in config space of USB controller, right?

Ahha. May that mean that our magic w.r.t. touching pci config space on
ALI chipsets is wrong?

Yes.

I thought I already mailed you lspci.... dump_pirq is not installed on
my machine, I'll try to install it and mail you that info. [Hmm, it
may be hard, because I'm now on modem link and behind nasty firewall;
perhaps you could just mail me dump_pirq binary if it does not need
special libraries?]
