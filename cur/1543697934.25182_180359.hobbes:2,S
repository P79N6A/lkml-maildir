Rebooted to 2.6.0-test10, deadline scheduler now, and have managed to 
do an 'su amanda' at least twice without any hangs.
Three times now, no problems.  4 times, exited the last one with a 
ctrl-d instead of an exit string, and now the 5th time is hung.  Is 
ctrl-d no longer a valid shell exit option?  Finding the su PID, and 
catting /proc/PID/wchan returns this just as it did yesterday:
[root@coyote root]# ps -ea |grep su
26658 pts/1    00:00:00 su
[root@coyote root]# cat /proc/26658/wchan
sys_wait4[root@coyote root]#
Comment on schedulers, deadline seems to leave me with the snappiest 
machine response, with cfq a close second.  The default anticipatory 
just doesn't have the right 'feel' to it.
Also, setiathome only did 3 units yesterday, and it normally does 4 to 
5.  With the overcommit_memory non-zeroed, the machine was an 
arthritic, stuttering as it barked, spastic dog.
Or, any cat could have caught that mouse...
