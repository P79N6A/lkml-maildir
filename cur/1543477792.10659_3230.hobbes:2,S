Ah but if what you say is true the db server shm issue raised by Stephen
is completly pointless. If the shm memory is used as _cache_ for the data
there's _no_ one point to swapout it out in first place. So when using the
shm for caching purposes the db server _must_ set the SHM_LOCK flag on the
shm memory using shmctl.
