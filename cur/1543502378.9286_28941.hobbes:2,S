I found block lengths etc of my partitions... I accidentally blew away
my partition table (fd0!=hda) and unfortunately I have no way to do a
backup and so have little.  The system is still up and running.  Is
there anyway I can recreate exactly the same partition table?  I imagine
all the information is in /proc, but I can't find it.  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.  OBviously, especially with bad power quality here,
time is of the essense.
Thank you,
Trever
