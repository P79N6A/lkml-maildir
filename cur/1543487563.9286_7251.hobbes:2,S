Hi,
1) My system
AMD k6-2 300
ID7: Adaptec 2940AU (terminated)
ID0: U-SCSI-HDD Micropolis (terminated)
ID5: SCSI-ZIP (internal)
ID2: SCSI-CD-ROM Pioneer 32x
ID6: SCSI CD-Recorder TEAC CD-R55S
SCSI works fine under 2.2.1 (but not buring CD´s ... this only works
under 2.0.36 :-(
I tried 2.2.2 and got this messages (last lines):
--------------
...
(detecting Adaptec and the connected devices)
...
Detected CD-ROM sr1 at scsi0, ....
scsi: detected 2 SCSI CDROMs 2 SCSI Disks total
(scsi0:0:2:0) Syncronous at 10 Mbyte/sec, offset 15
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 32x/32x cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
(scsi0:0:6:0) Syncronous at 10 Mbyte/sec, offset 15
bug: kernel timer added twice at c01af114
---------------
Is this a known bug, any Patches?
Do you need more information, which?
Greetings
Raphael Becker
