Most mangled diffs I get are caused by pine. Fixing pine would do more
wonders than any magical patchbot. I also get patches and changes from
people who quite genuinely either can't mail me unmangled diffs (eg the
lotus corporate mail policy afflicted) or are from people who may really
know their stuff and even be the vendor but are not familiar with the 
patch/diff tools. A robot isn't going to teach them.
