Are you sure that it is the program getting this
error?  Have you traced this to a bad return from the
sendto function?
I have a couple thoughs.  One issue with the memory is
that going in and out of the driver, the network
buffers are DMA quality memory (meaning hardware
accessable address space, and contiguous physically,
rather than virtually).  When things get churned up it
can be difficult to get memory that fits those
criteria.
