Hi Peter,

I definitely agree there.
It's interesting to note that sysprof requires you to run the GUI as
root in order to work. Maybe Ingo and Arjan are confident there are no
bugs in all the libraries that sysprof links to:
# ldd `which sysprof` | wc -l
39
I'm not.
Actually before someone converted it to debugfs, it was even worse, the
sysprof kernel module exported all profiling information to the world:
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 2060 2008-02-25 23:00 /proc/sysprof-trace
