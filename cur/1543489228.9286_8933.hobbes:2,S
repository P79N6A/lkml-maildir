You're talking about doubling the disc storage requirements. The
software which wrote the data is also going to be used to do some
analysis, so the user needs to keep that version around.

Experience has showed that users don't like these extra steps. It has
to be transparent. And transparently writing out a byte swapped copy
of the data is not going to be received well, either.
