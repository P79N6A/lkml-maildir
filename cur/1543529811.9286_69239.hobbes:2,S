Most machines never run out of memory (+swap). That is
the only easy answer. In case something is screwed up
anyway, it's the kernel's job to fix it, preferably in
such a way that:
- normal system efficiency isn't affected
- the least amount of processes die
- the least amount of work gets lost
We can only do that by selecting the memory hog and shooting
it at the time an out of memory situation occurs. This is what
my patch does.
