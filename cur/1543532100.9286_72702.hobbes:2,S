I'll have to get back to you on that -- sshd isn't responding right now for
some reason so I can't get in to play... (actually it won't even ping :( )
I'm not sure what 451 is/was - I do know that I do have an mgetty process
set up for COM1, but I'm also not sure that that's the only process entry that
causes problems for ls/cat.  I may not be able to look at it until I get home
tonight unless I can get a response from it... I'll keep trying though.
