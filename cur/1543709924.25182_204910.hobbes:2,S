Hi,
	I've tried
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0309.3/0802.html
to try the 'Bind Mount Extensions (RO --bind mounts)'
I've applied the patch on 2.4.24 and 2.6.3, without effects, ie
mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdc7 /mnt/ro
mount --bind -o rw /mnt/ro /mnt/ro2rw
touch  /mnt/ro2rw/test
touch: connot touch '/mnt/ro2rw/test': Read Only file system
have I miss something ?
curently, i'm running up-to date debian unstable with mount-2.12 and a 
patched version ( 
http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Experimental/patch-2.6.0-test3-bme0.03.diff
) 
  of 2.6.3
BTW, is this patch could work on NFS RO mounts ? I'm very interressted 
in it because y try to mount / from nfs RO. I've got some success with 
http://translucency.sourceforge.net/,
 But I'd would like test others 
approach.
Thx

Olivier
