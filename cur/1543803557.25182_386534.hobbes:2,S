Right, no reason not to just put this into a hotplug script, is there?
Is it, when it comes down to it, significantly different than automating

Experts in ancient Greek culture say that people back then didn't see their
thoughts as belonging to them.  When they had a thought, it occured to them
as a god or goddess giving them an order.  Apollo was telling them to be
brave.  Athena was telling them to fall in love.
Now people hear a commercial for sour cream potato chips and rush out to buy.
