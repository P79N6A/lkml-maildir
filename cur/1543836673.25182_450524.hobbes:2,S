Well, it certainly doesn't sound like XFS is making this sort of guarantee.
Another method I've seen file systems use is to only update atime if the
difference between current time and the current inode atime is greater than
some timeout value. I'm not a huge fan of that approach as it seems less
predicatble than Val's, and doesn't (theoretically) preserve performance
like the XFS approach.
That said, it's not like OCFS2 doesn't have to care just because other file
systems don't but I don't see much complaining about their methods.

For OCFS2, the performance hit of 'immediate' atime updates could be
considerable. It's essentially turning a bunch of read only cluster locks
into exclusive ones, and forcing a disk update. This means that other nodes
who have locks on the object would have to invalidate their cache. The node
doing the update will be have to flush it's journal before giving the lock
up, incurring additional cost.
We could certainly give OCFS2 an "immediate atime" mode, but maybe that
could be done as a different mount option? Say, "immatime"? That way the
default is to get the large middle ground. Those who want more performance
could use 'noatime', and those concerned with absolute 100% correctness of
atime in the event of a crash could use the new option.
