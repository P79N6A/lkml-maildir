You don't have markers (although they're defined, see ISO 2022) for your 
8-bit encodings, and *THEY'RE THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE DISTINGUISHED.* 
Flagging UTF-8, especially with the BOM (as opposed to the ISO 2022 
signature, <ESC>%G) is pointless in the context, since you still can't 
distinguish your arbitrary number of legacy encodings.
Oh, yes, and try to stick ISO 2022 signatures in scripts or whatnot, and 
you can see what current software does with a signature standard that 
dates back to the 1970's.
