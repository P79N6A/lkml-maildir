Hee.
I had a similar blackout when I debugged a problem in PAE36:
set_fixmap() checks that the idx entry is valid, but there are no checks
on the physical address.
AFAIK you would have to
* add a new entry to the fixmap enum in <include/asm/fixmap.h>
* call set_fixmap() before accessing the physical page.
	set_fixmap(FIX_MP_TABLE,phys_addr)
* then you access the mapped memory with
	unsigned long* ptr = fix_to_virt(FIX_MP_TABLE);
	parse_table(ptr);
But I think that kmap_atomic() is the far better solution - fixmap
entries are for frequently accessed pages, and IIRC you try to access a
MP table that required only during boot.
	struct page* tmp = mem_map+(phys_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT);
	unsigned long* ptr = kmap_atomic(tmp,KM_BOUNCE_READ);
	now_use_ptr(ptr);
	kunmap_atomic(ptr, KM_BOUNCE_READ);
Both interfaces should work immediately after paging_init().
