Hi,
        I am using Fedora Core-3 with kernel 2.6.10 to develop a 
loadable module. when I am trying a huge amount of I/O,  pdflush daemon 
consume 100% of cpu utilization.  Due to this it reduce the module 
performance. So please give any suggestion how to tune pdflush daemon  
or is there any patch required for this.
Regards
