Right. That's why these plugins are linked in uncoditionally. It doesn't
work without them. Hence "plugins" is not a very good name.

That's your opinion. reiser4 seems to work very well.

This is how reiserfs v3 did it. And Hans says that it actually
complicated things.

What I understood is that you can select exactly one plugin that e.g.
handles the file data. The default plugin is optimized for normal files,
another one could implement transparent compression or encryption. Some
of these plugins also give the storage layer hints how to group files
together to optimized performance. Neither of these things mess with the
VFS.

Yes, that's what I was trying to say.
