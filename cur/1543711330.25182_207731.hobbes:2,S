Yes, it would be nice but I fear that it gets complicated.
Is it not the case that two dm maps can refer to the same queue?  Say, one
map uses /dev/hda1 and another map uses /dev/hda2?
If so, then when the /dev/hda queue is plugged we need to tell both the
higher-level maps that this queue needs an unplug.  So blk_plug_device()
and the various unplug functions need to perform upcalls to an arbitrary
number of higher-level drivers, and those drivers need to keep track of the
currently-plugged queues without adding data structures to the
request_queue structure.
It can be done of course, but could get messy.
Or am I missing something?
