	BTW, why on the earth had the damn thing tried to grab hda 6
times?  It was _not_ touching partitions - all claims (i.e. open_dev()
calls in dm-table.c) had been for dev == MKDEV(3.0).
	What userland tools do you have and how are they invoked?  Having
a leak like that (it looks like we have a struct dm_dev leaking there,
so destructor is never called) is a bug in any case, but I really wonder
what had triggered these opens in the first place.
