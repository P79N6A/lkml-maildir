Running different scheds on a single RQ at the same time on the same resource 
would be rather odd.  That's why independent RQs are necessary even on SMP.  
OTOH, running independent RQs on UP doesn't make much sense, unless there is 
a way to relate them.

Are you sure?
MultiDimensional RunQueues spring to mind.
