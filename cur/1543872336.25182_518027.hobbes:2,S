that's kind of what i had in mind.  i have a script that peruses the
source tree, checking for apparent typoes in preprocessor directives
when someone forgets the leading "CONFIG_", and as long as that macro
name is the way it is, that example is going to be flagged every time
for no good reason.
if someone wants to make a suggestion, i can submit a simple renaming
patch.
