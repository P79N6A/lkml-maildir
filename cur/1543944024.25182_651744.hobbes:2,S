Just to be absolutely sure, we don't need any barriers here to ensure we 
get the right generations, do we?
Also, this isn't expected to let I/O survive a disk being unplugged 
briefly, then plugged back in, is it? (I recall that being discussed, 
but I think it was as a 'would be nice to do in the future' thing).
