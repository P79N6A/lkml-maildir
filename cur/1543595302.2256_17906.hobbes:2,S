After some testing, removing the grsecurity patch seems to have solved
the disappearing-free-space problem. Now just need to find out why.

It was a test partition, just happended to be a root one. AFAIAA, isn't
the fact that the file format may change irrelevant. You want people to
test this stuff or not? If it's not tested on a root fs then how do you
know there won't be any problems.
Sorry, but when someone reports a problem, and then you say, well don't
test it like that then, it is really not acceptable.
