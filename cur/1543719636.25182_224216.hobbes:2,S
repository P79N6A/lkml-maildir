Hello,
could someone help me with a ioremap problem. If there are two 
controllers plugged in, the ioremap request for the first controller is 
successfull, but the second returns NULL. Here is the output of the driver:
i2o: Checking for PCI I2O controllers...
i2o: I2O controller on bus 0 at 72.
i2o: PCI I2O controller at 0xD0000000 size=134217728
I2O: MTRR workaround for Intel i960 processor
i2o/iop0: Installed at IRQ17
i2o: I2O controller on bus 0 at 96.
i2o: PCI I2O controller at 0xD8000000 size=134217728
i2o: Unable to map controller.
I've seen that there was a problem with 2.4 already, but didn't find it 
with 2.6. Please could someone help me how to resolve this problem?
Any help is appreciated.
Best regards,
Markus Lidel
