What exactly does CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV do?
I found that _not_setting it, 2.4.31 still looks for keyboard at boot:
Oct  9 10:41:49 kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(ed)
Oct  9 10:41:50 kernel: keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(f4)
and doing a find/grep in the code reveals that CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV doesn't 
seem to do anything anywhere except def/undef itself:
[root@linux-2.4.31]# find . -name \*.h -exec grep -iHn "INPUT_KEYBDEV" {} \;
./include/linux/autoconf.h:482:#undef  CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV
./include/config/input/keybdev.h:1:#undef  CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV
[root@linux-2.4.31]# find . -name \*.c -exec grep -iHn "INPUT_KEYBDEV" {} \;
... nothing...
Therefore I still have to manually edit include/linux/pc_keyb.h to undef the 
(no) keyboard timeouts:
?
