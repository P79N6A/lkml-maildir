Just isolate the offending function (gcc's -Q option is handy here), and
try to cut out as much other cruft as you can from the preprocessed
source. Consider either analyzing that for a solution to your problem, or
sending it off to the egcs folks (the documentation or the webpage at

I was told that the compiler uses lots of signals internally, so don't be
surprised if it segfaults all over the place: The problem is when it doen't
catch the signal.
Good luck!
