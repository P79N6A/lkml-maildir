ive noticed the same problem -- mouse movement itself is even jerky, so
i suspect events are being lost.  the mouse is not really even usable
for me in X.
i too traced the problem down to hid-core.c, i think, and i am going to
try to write up a patch against the latest ac, but the Maintainer may
already realize the problem?
