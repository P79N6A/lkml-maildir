I recall losing track of what that issue was, and thinking a new explanation
was needed ... no such issues were described in this patch or its summary.

the opposite, it assumed all architectures _could_ work that way.

Better IMO to use a more traditional run-time function call style
hook, not the link time magic you're now using.  Point is, this
is most accurately a _board_ option not an architectural one.
Even systems that _could_ provide some access to a persistent
clock without relying on IRQs might be designed not to do so.
For example, RTCs integrated into system-on-chip processors
can be less power-efficient than discrete ones, so that when
power-efficient design is essential, that integrated RTC may
not be a viable design option.
And since we expect Linux kernels to be able to run on more
than one board, that includes configurations where one of the
boards uses the integrated register-based RTC, and another
uses a discrete one with serial interface.  But your choice
of link-time binding precludes one kernel handling both boards
correctly...

That XXX comment disagrees ... it assumes all architectures can work
that way ...
And I'm not sure about "majority"; depends how you count.  Certainly
the number of embedded boards that could work differently is large and
growing ... and there are a lot more embedded computers in the world
than desktops, laptops, or servers.

It's not a "catch" for the systems which have an RTC class driver,
and your approach doesn't cover 100% either.
The key difference between the two approaches is that yours **CANNOT**
handle cases like an I2C based RTC (call them "message based RTCs"), where
the RTC class drivers **CAN** handle "register based RTCs".

It's a question of scope, I guess.  You're limiting your solution to
boards that don't require message based RTCs.  I'm thinking that's not
really sufficient ... and it bothers me to see something be pitched
as a basic architectural feature of the clock/time framework when
it's so clearly not sufficient.

So long as this GTOD patch is updated to reflect the reality that
not all _boards_ can (or will) support that style of RTC ... cleanup
is good, but those code comments suggest deeper assumptions.

That is, three different ways to do it.

Getting rid of one is useful, yes.  But why not get rid of two?

I'm not sure I see how the last two groups are very different;
are you saying it would get rid of these message-unfriendly
read_persistent_clock() calls?
