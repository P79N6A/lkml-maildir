I don't have the latest kernels installed here so the behavior may
have changed. However,
#ifndef __KERNEL__
#define __KERNEL__
#endif
#ifndef MODULE
#define MODULE
#endif
#define __DRIVER__
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/malloc.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <asm/uaccess.h>
#include <asm/io.h>
static struct wait_queue *wait = NULL;
int init_module(void)
{
    int result;
    printk("Calling wake_up_interruptible\n");
    wake_up_interruptible(&wait);
    printk("Returned immediately\n");
    printk("Calling interruptible_sleep_on\n");
    interruptible_sleep_on(&wait);
    printk("Returned immediately\n");
    return 0;
}
void cleanup_module(void)
{
}
This code, with 2.3.13 shows that interruptible_sleep_on does,
as previously stated, return immediately if wake_up_interruptible
was called first. Now, if the behavior has changed since 2.3.13
we certainly have a problem.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
