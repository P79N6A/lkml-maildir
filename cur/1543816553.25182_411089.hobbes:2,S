Hmm, I see where you're going with this.  Thanks for the tip!

I'm not entirely sure I understand this bit.  The idea behind this  
kabi stuff is precisely to split out portions of the headers so that  
both userspace and kernelspace can get at them; to designate specific  
items as "userspace clean" by putting them in kabi; everything else  
need not care at all, and all those headers would remain in include/ 
linux where they are now.  No sense moving _everything_ in include/  
around, we just want the parts that userspace needs too.

_Exactly_ the point.  I'd like to leave 99% of the kernel code  
alone.  Userspace doesn't work with the headers in the stock kernel  
as-is, so I see no problem with working to provide a clean source ABI  
even if it's partially incompatible with the old source ABI.  The  
binary ABI would stay the same, though, and I'd try to fix the old  
source ABI where possible.
I think I'll try something like your original proposal:
include/kabi/			<= Userspace-clean generic ABI includes
include/$(ARCH)/		<= New arch-specific include directory
include/$(ARCH)/kabi-arch/	<= Arch-specific ABI includes
Then the following Makefile snippet:
LINUXINCLUDE += -Iinclude/$(ARCH)
And then in the header file:
#include <kabi-arch/stddef.h>
#include <kabi/types.h>
It would also be possible to move files from include/asm-$(ARCH) to  
include/$(ARCH)/asm if desired, but that's a little offtopic for the  
kernel-ABI headers project I'm working on right now.
Thanks for the advice!
