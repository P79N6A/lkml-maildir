Seems you guys are the furthest ahead for a working logical volume manager
in 2.5. Does the EVMS team plan to send patches for 2.5 before the freeze?
It would be great to have EVMS in 2.5 (assuming the community approves of
EVMS going in). Seems to be very non-invasive touching almost no common code.
How far along are you with the clustering support (distributed locking of
cluster metadata and update notification, etc)? This is what i'm really after.
