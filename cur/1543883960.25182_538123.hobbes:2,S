Hi,
Following this email are the 34 patches for GFS2 for this merge window.
They are mostly cleanups and bug fixes again, although there are one or
two new features. The edited highlights are:
 - Merge lowcomms code in DLM so that the protocol is run-time
selectable rather than compile time
 - Add support for GFS2 "lockdump" debugging feature
 - Various bug fixes & cleanups
Note that the code thats added commented out, in patch 11, (just a
couple of lines in all) and changed again in patch 24 is uncommented in
patch 34 since the patch upon which it depends (sprint_symbol) has just
been merged into Linus' tree from -mm yesterday,
Steve.
