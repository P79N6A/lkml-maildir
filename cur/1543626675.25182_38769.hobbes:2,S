   You mean the 'server' ? Even if I add a sleep(600) between the 
   shutdown() call and the exit() call I get the same behaviour.
Oh I see now.  Here is what should happen:
	* server shutdown(ALL)
	* the write() should succeed on the client
	* client socket receives a TCP reset
If this isn't what is happening, send us a trace.
