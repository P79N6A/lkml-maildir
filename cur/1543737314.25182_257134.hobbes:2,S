If this is a new CF capable of DMA but CF-to-IDE adapter doesn't support
DMA (most don't) then "ide=nodma" kernel command line parameter should
do the job.  It might be also bug in via82cxxx host driver.
Maybe DMA should be off by default for CF but it requires fixing almost
every IDE host driver and why punish good hardware.
