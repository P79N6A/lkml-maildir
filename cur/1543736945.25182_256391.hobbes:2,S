Subject: 2.6.9-rc2-mm[2-4]: zaphod-scheduler.patch makes swsusp incredibly slow (was: Re: 2.6.9-rc2-mm3: swsusp horribly slow on AMD64)

Hi,
I have verified that the odd symptoms described previously in this thread 
result from the zaphod-scheduler.patch.
To show this, I took the 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 kernel, reverted the 
zaphod-scheduler.patch and applied the following changes to swsusp.c:
--- a/kernel/power/swsusp.c	2004-09-29 21:45:15.000000000 +0200
+++ b/kernel/power/swsusp.c	2004-09-29 22:08:33.971404368 +0200

+					i / mod, (jiffies - start_time)/HZ);
 		error = write_page((pagedir_nosave+i)->address,
 					  &((pagedir_nosave+i)->swap_address));
 	}
-	printk("\b\b\b\bdone\n");
+	printk(" ... done\n");
 	return error;
 }
 
Then, I obtained the following result:

which is OK, IMO.  However, for the vanilla 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 (with the same 
changes to swsusp.c), I get:

which should give you an idea what kind of a slowdown I was talking about 
earlier.
Well, zaphod-scheduler.patch is a big patch and I know to little to be able to 
figure out what's wrong with it so it causes the observed symptoms to appear.  
If you can, please help me fix this.
Greets,
