(I'm keeping the CC to l-k, but let's move this to the acpilist, ok?)
acpi_get_battery_info is brand new code. It worked on my box, though ;-) can
you help me narrow down which of the assignments near the end of the
function is to blame? (via printk, I guess)
If you could post your DSDT that would be great too.
Concerning the slowness issue you mention. I'm not convinced this is a real
issue if just bogomips is less. I could be wrong..Does the system actually
feel slow?
