That capability is not permanent. If you let users write to the
SEEPROM, permanently changing the IEEE Station Address, you have
let users permanently break their network boards. I do protest
when this capability is in the kernel.
Anybody, who knows how can, write a driver that can destroy their
disk drives, their modems, their audio boards, their screen-cards,
their motherboards, ...the list goes on..., because EEPROMS are
being used now days. But, you don't put that capability in the
kernel as a default.
If you do, you get complaints from those who have had the misfortune of
being interrogated by lawyers.
Also, if you want to destroy Ethernet, mucking with the MAC address
is an easy way to do it.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
