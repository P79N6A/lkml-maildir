Weird, I can't see all those stuff here. It shows something like
(running from master copy at kernel.org):
$ git-show e338b736f1aee59b757130ffdc778538b7db18d6
diff-tree e338b736f1aee59b757130ffdc778538b7db18d6 (from
cb31c70cdf1ac7034bed5f83d543f4888c39888a)

    Merging Linus tree
diff --git a/Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
b/Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
...
So, after the merging message, I have a normal diff with:
 179 files changed, 1274 insertions(+), 785 deletions(-)
Seeming all perfect from my knowledge about git.
I don't want to bother you more with this subject. If you don't mind,
I'll make a brief from what we've discussed here, and I'll open a thread
at git mailing list c/c you. 
>From my part, I'm not comfortable with a weird situation that generated
such bad merging, so, I'm very concerned about it. I'm here to
contribute, not to disturb with bad patches or bad merges. If this issue
is not addressed, it may generate troubles in the future.
