Watch for white space damage, last two lines has one extra tab on the indentation.
By the way, there is all kinds of non-linear behavior with priority boost
adjustment:
        if (p->sleep_type == SLEEP_NONINTERACTIVE && p->mm) {
                if (p->sleep_avg >= ceiling)
                        sleep_time = 0;
                else if (p->sleep_avg + sleep_time >= ceiling) {
                        p->sleep_avg = ceiling;
                        sleep_time = 0;
                }
        }
For large p->sleep_avg, kernel don't clamp it to ceiling, yet clamp small
incremental sleep.  This all seems very fragile.
