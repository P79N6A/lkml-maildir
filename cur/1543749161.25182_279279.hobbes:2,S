One minor complaint:  the caller of capset() will no longer receive any
error code if security_capset_check() fails.  I don't think that it is
necessary to preserve any error return in the cases where capset() is
being applied to multiple processes, but in the case where it is being
applied to a single specific process, it would be nice if any error
return from security_capset_check() would be returned to the caller.
I also wonder whether the existing hardcoded checks should be moved into
the new security_capset_check() hook function for dummy and commoncap so
that they will be applied to the real target, even when pid < 0. 
Otherwise, those hardcoded checks seem bogus in the pid < 0 case, as
they are then applied to current rather than to the true targets.
