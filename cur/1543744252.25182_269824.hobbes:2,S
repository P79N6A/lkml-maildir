Ok, in looking some more at this, you are right.
So, how to solve this.  I don't want a bus callback for bind, unbind,
re-bind, bind-every-other-day-depending-on-the-phase-of-the-moon, and so
on.  I really think we can do this with the current callbacks that we
have today.
All we have to do is rework that rwsem lock.  It's been staring at us
since the beginning of the driver core work, and we knew it would have
to be fixed eventually.  So might as well do it now.
Unfortunatly it seems everyone likes to grab that lock, so it's not
going to be a simple thing to fix (in their defense, we encouraged
people to grab the lock, so it's our fault too.)
So, if we fix up the locking issues, then we can do the following, which
I know people have been wanting to do:
	- add new devices from within a probe() callback.
	- remove other devices from within a probe() callback.
	- remove other devices from the remove() callback.
	- unbind devices from the driver core.
and other good stuff.
So, off to rework this mess...
thanks,
