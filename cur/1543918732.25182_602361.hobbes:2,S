Yay documentation, and I read it, but it's still adding complexity:

This adds a new buffer in parallel with the old buffer.  The new one is 
significantly more complex to use from userspace, and has no advantages for 
the _current_ uses of it, therefore the old one will never _stop_ being used, 
and thus can probably never be removed.
But it's not bloat.  Right.

Run dmesg through a filter in userspace using lots of regular expressions.  
Your average perl junkie could knock out a basic prototype in 20 minutes.
This also gives you the option of _not_ using the filter to get the raw dmesg 
output in english, which is the only thing this list can diagnose.
If you think that's going to break when kernel guys change the code each 
release, explain how your new one _wouldn't_.

That's a good thing?  It's infrastructure in search of a use, implementing 
things that might, at some future date, be interesting, and complicating the 
code to do it in both the kernel and userspace.
I'm missing the "advantage" part.  I'm not close to perfect so I could just be 
failing to see its obvious greatness, but I continue to fail to see it...
