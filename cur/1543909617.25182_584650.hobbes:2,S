Of course we can.  These guys can be sparse - note that ->start()
takes a pointer, and for a good reason.  ->start(m, p, pos) should
get the first entry with offset >= *pos (or NULL if we are done) and
set *pos accordingly.
That m->index++ is "we are done with the partial, step just past it, so
that ->start() will pick the first real entry after it the next time it's
called".
For dense case we don't need to update *pos in ->start() - either
we already have one with offset == *pos (and no update is needed),
or we are finished and should return NULL.
However, we have every right to live with sparse offsets; prototype of
->start() had been done the way it's done exactly to allow that kind
of use.
