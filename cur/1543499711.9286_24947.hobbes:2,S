Hello,
	I also have an AHA 2940 and have just experianced a kernel hang
without an Opps report in my log files. I am going to patch up to 
2.2.10 and see if that helps. My swap and / are on the AHA2940 but the
files I was working with where on my IDE drive. Please let me know
if you would like more information.
The crash happend just after ftping a 3.3M file and untar'ing it.
