I think reverting it is the correct thing to do.

sd_done and sr_done are called for REQ_TYPE_FS -- if the request comes
in through one of the SG interfaces, we call scsi_setup_blk_pc_cmnd()
which sets the ->done callback to scsi_blk_pc_done.

That's in the patch.  But it would be the wrong thing to do because SG
commands should not be molested by the sr/sd driver.
