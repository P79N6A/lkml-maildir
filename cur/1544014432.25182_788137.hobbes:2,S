>What is the gain/pain ratio here?
Certainly depends on the pov - it reduces the kernel module (disk) image
sizes quite a bit, so from a distro perspective its a move against the ever
growing package sizes (and the disk space) hundreds or even thousands
of modules require.

That's certainly a possibility, but I have to admit that I'd like to keep the
option - a respective config option could default to 'no' if the build issues
are considered more significant. I'm really not that much worried about
adding another config parameter here...
>We would still benefir from all the other stripping done - no?
Yes.
