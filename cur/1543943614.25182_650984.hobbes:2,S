Please don't mention the file name in the top-of-file comments.  This
information is redundant and will easily get out of date when moving
files around or copying them.  Note that this applies to basically
any file in this patch.

arch ifdefs don't belong into an asm-generic/ file.  Please have a
proper asm-x86/kgdb.h that defines these things.

Kerneldoc comments don't belong above the prototype of a function but
the function body.

I don't really thing this belongs into an asm-generic header, again.
ARchitectures having shadow info should just provide this in their
own asm-foo/kgdb.h.  Or better yet just kill it for the first
submission.

shouldn't this use per-cpu data?  Or is that in some way to
fragile for a debugger?

No need to initialize fields to 0 or NULL in static variables.

lots of superflous braces.  More of them later in this file
in the same style.

This is really ugly, but I don't really know a good way around it
either.

similar odd indentation in a few other spots.

Why can't this be set in the X86_64 config?

I think these two would be better as depends on
