I'm using both devfs and preempt. The first time I booted (I think it
was actually 2.5.66), I tried to mount /zip, and it hung, with 100%
cpu usage after that (I can't rememebr what process), and several
traces in syslog (lsmod showed the modules as loaded, I think one or
two of them "unsafe"). Next time I booted (2.5.67+V4L patches), I
modprobed ppa manually, this time, it segfaulted (with traces in
syslog), but the modules were listed in lsmod correcly. I then
mounted, and it was fine.
Sorry I don't have the logs with me, one of the drawbacks of being too
cheap to afford a home innernet connection :(
