Well.......
I sorta DISCOVERED THIS!
But, I bow to Oleg anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great utilities!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Before seeing this I installed Slack 8.0 on another small partition, downloaded
2.4.18, latest reiser tools from slack's site. I had to so a --rebuild-sb
thought first. Then the rebuild tree.....
Now I am back in Linux heaven!  It just booted.
Oh man these errors freaked me the hell out.
I am still turned off by seeing the $25/per question for support on
namesys.com after clicking on "Support" with NO mention of the mailing list.
I found the mailing list LATER and some useful tips.
My brain kernel paniced!
Root FS backup commences...... :-)
Thank you Oleg!
