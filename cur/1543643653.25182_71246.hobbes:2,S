   are there any standards in progress to support this.
Your question makes no sense, it is a hardware optimization
of an existing standard.  The chip merely is told what flows
exist and it concatenates TCP data from consequetive packets
for that flow if they arrive in sequence.
   who is working on this architecture for receives?
Once cards with the feature exist, probably Alexey and myself
will work on it.
Basically, who ever isn't busy with something else once the technology
appears.
   is there a beginning implementation yet of zerocopy receives
No.
Franks a lot,
