They do, but they won't use it. They want to *sell* windows and they're
(more or less) willing to decode their blue screens produced by 3rd
vendor's drivers. However, GPL people may (or may not) be willing to
spend time in searching bugs in other company's drivers. However, *I* am
not willig to do other people's job, especially if *they* earn money
therefor...
