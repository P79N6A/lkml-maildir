Please mention explicitely whether Acked-by: this now considered a 
formal tag like Signed-off-by:
IOW, if a maintainer says "fine with me", can I translate this to an 
Acked-by: line, or do I now have to ask for an explicit Acked-by: line?
Oh, and that's not a theoretical question, this is a result of a recent 
flamewar^Wdiscussion on this list...
