That would definitely be nice.

... which exactly mirrors the pain and suffering which libc maintainers 
have to deal with.  The amount of time I spent per line of code in klibc 
is quite high, in part because I wanted it to be as self-porting as was 
possible.  I've really tried to avoid arch-specific hacks, and yet there 
are more there than there should be, in large part because of unusable 
or missing kernel header exports.
