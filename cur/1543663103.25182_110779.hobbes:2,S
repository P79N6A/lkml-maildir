After much testing, which is still in progress it would seem that
*maybe* mjb4 does have the problem too, although it's much harder to
hit.  Please note that this is a single data point where for other
kernels I have two or more occurrences of spontaneous reboots.
I've been checking older kernels...  it would seem the problem first
occurs in 2.5.53 (that is 2.5.53 through 2.5.62-bk all reboot for me).
2.5.51 doesn't appear to and thus far neither does 2.5.52.
I say thus far, because the problem usually appears after about 15
minutes of compiling, but it sometimes takes a little longer.  I'm
running 2.5.52 now and after 45 minutes it's still going.
As to what difference it might be between '52 and '53 I have no idea.
I had a quick look and the changes there are considerable.
I've tried different compiles, with and without preempt, and and
without IO-APIC and trimming down the kernel...
