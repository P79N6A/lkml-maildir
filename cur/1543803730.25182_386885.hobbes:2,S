Thanks for doing that - I know it's a lot of work, but boy it helps.

Yes, that is strange.  I do recall that if something accidentally enables
interrupts too early in boot, ppc64 machines tend to go comatose.  But if
we'd been running that code under local_irq_disable(), down() would have
spat a warning.
Drat, it seems I don't have CPU hotplug in my ppc64 config.
