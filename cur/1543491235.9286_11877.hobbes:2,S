Ugh, can this loon get blocked as a spammer? :-) Well, this is
the 3rd offense. Every time, a huge flamewar results.
He keeps going off on this "GNU/Linux" thing. He's obviously wrong too,
because we wouldn't call this the "linux-kernel" list if the term "Linux"
alone referred to the kernel. We'd just call this the "linux" list.
To give him credit where credit is due, he should be listed in the
CREDITS file as the author of COPYING. That is what every contributer
deserves to get.
