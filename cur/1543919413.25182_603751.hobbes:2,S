The tvp5150 as well as several other drivers have some slight changes
in it to get some devices work.
My motivation behind it is that since I don't agree with certain
linuxtv development paths and it makes it alot easier to handle
prewritten code from some companies.

Merge the bridging code and the issue is done, the other guys should
go their own paths with their own drivers if they want so. Time will
show what will be better in the end.
There are not so many devices out there which have newer requirements,
although the em28xx is a good example for at least one device which
doesn't fit.
If someone's looking for another disagreement between developers
(which my code is not part of):
