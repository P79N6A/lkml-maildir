gfp_mask doesn't carry the needed information. It depends on whether
the current context holds a rcu_read_lock().
so something like:
   rcu_read_lock()
   foo = kmalloc(sizeof(foo))
      new_slab()
        __alloc_pages()
          try_to_free_pages()
            synchronise_rcu() <-- deadlock
   rcu_read_unlock()
