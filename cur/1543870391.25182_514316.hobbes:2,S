nsproxy seems the best place to me to hang off the resource control
objects (nsproxy->ctlr_data[]). These objects provide information like
resource limit etc required by the resource controllers.
Alternately we could move them to task_struct which would cause unnecessary 
duplication of pointers (and wastage of space).
