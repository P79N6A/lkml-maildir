  Your test program fails (at least on my box) as the overhead of 
starting and stopping the trace in the 5 ms period is just too high.
  By moving the latency_trace_start() at the start of the thread 
function and latency_trace_stop() at the end, everything runs fine.
I did not have any period missed even under heavy load.
