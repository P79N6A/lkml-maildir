No. It should only be "locally fatal", and it should clearly just do what 
BUG() does now - kill the process.
But that implies very much that you really cannot use FATAL() in general
at all, since it would be illegal to use whenever some caller holds some
non-local locks (which is almost always the case for most "peripheral
code").
