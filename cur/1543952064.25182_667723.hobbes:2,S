It would be interesting if you could get register dumps at a couple of 
different points, using the intel_reg_dumper tool in 
git://git.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/driver/xf86-video-intel (in 
src/reg_dumper).  You'll probably have to modify your boot scripts though.  
It would be good to get them:
  - at startup time before the splash screen
  - sometime while the splash screen is running
  - after X starts and you see the blank screen
Since I think this is actually an X driver bug, can you file a bug at 
freedesktop.org and attach the register dumps there?

What's different between your Uni. environment and your home environment?

Well, it's possible that the wireless issue is affecting the pipe programming 
timing enough to expose the bug (stuff like this is usually a problem with 
either not waiting for a register program to take effect and/or programming 
the regs in the wrong order).

Yeah, looks like it's off.  Ubuntu may be falling back to using the X vesa 
driver or something though...
