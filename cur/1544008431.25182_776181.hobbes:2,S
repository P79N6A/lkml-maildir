Moreover, to check if the problem may be related to the prefetch window,
I added the appended patch on top of -rc7 (instead of the previous debug
patch), which resulted in the following layout in /proc/iomem:
88000000-8dffffff : PCI Bus 0000:03
  88000000-8bffffff : PCI CardBus 0000:04
  8c000000-8c003fff : 0000:03:0b.1
  8c004000-8c004fff : 0000:03:0b.0
    8c004000-8c004fff : yenta_socket
  8c005000-8c0057ff : 0000:03:0b.1
    8c005000-8c0057ff : firewire_ohci
  8c005800-8c0058ff : 0000:03:0b.3
    8c005800-8c0058ff : mmc0
  8c400000-8c7fffff : PCI CardBus 0000:04
and the first hibernation-resume cycle failed.
Thanks,
Rafael
