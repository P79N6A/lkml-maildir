Not true.. see net.ipv* stuff - for each device, same parameters are to be set.
I see no problem in this.

Set 1 for dev.ide.host0.bus0.target0.lun0.dma (we should stay consistent at
least with devfs, or we can give it up completely ;)

Well, why not maintainers of appropriate kernel sections, or even special
maintainer, like the one for device numbers. For each section of sysctl
namespace, subset of required ctls should be defined, obviously not restricting
optional bloat ;).
