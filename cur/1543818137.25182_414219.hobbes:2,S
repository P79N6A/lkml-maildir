Kernbench is a cpu throughput benchmark originally devised and used by Martin 
J.Bligh. It is designed to compare kernel changes on the same machine.
It runs a kernel compile at various numbers of concurrent jobs: 1/2 number of 
cpus, optimal (default is 4xnumber of cpus) and maximal job count. Optionally 
it can also run single threaded. It then prints out a number of useful 
statistics for the average of each group of runs and logs them to 
kernbench.log

Changes:
v0.41 Fixed make oldconfig
v0.40 Made all runs use the oldconfig if it exists. Changed to only do one
	warmup run before all the benchmarks. Added logging to kernbench.log
	Cleaned up the code substantially to reuse code where possible.
	Added standard deviation statistics courtesy of Peter Williams
