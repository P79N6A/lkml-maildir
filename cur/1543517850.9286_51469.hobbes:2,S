(Sound of head banging against wall... ouch!) Yep, that would do it, I
should have done an --exclude journal.dat...

Maybe at least stick a nice big warning in the docs along the lines of "do
not write to your journal file while mounted with journaling on, you big
dummy!" :) Not that I'd do so deliberately of course, but it might make
people a little more wary later on. The README does recommend setting the
permissions to 400, but that doesn't protect from root of course.
Is there any reason you _would_ want to be able to write to the journal
file from userland while mounted? I'd guess no...
