I suspect that the proper way to do this is to just make another gfp_flag,
which is basically another hint to the mm layer that we're doing a multi-
page allocation and that the MM layer should not try forever to handle it.
In fact, that's independent of whether it is a multi-page allocation or
not. It might be something like __GFP_SOFT - you could use it with single
pages too. 
Thinking about it, we do have it already. It's called !__GFP_HIGH, and it
used by all the GFP_USER allocations.
