Okay, got a chance to finish working this.  It _does_ boot my Miata - it was
the de4x5 driver that was puking on my 21143-PC adapter (built-in) (it shows
as a DC21142 rev 48 under 2.2.12-29 (stock RH6.1)).  I tried with the tulip
driver, but that wedged configuring the eth0 device.
Then I set it so there was no ethernet cards supported (created the modules,
never installed them).  System now boots, but oopses when I ifconfig the
ethernet card.  But _only_ when I set the IP address, the netmask, and
broadcast address at once.  Wierd.
Does anyone have a pointer to a new tulip.c that actually compiles under the
latest 2.3 series?  I tried 0.91 from cesdis, but it didn't even compile.  I
can provide the errors, if anyone would like.  Help/ideas?  Oh, and when will
changes like this get folded into 2.3 proper?  I'm still running 2.3.10 to do
benchmarks as nothing newer boots on rawhides...HELP!!!
