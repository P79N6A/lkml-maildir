Yes, I know all that, is has been explained to me a few times already,
f.ex. when I was asking for fixing asm()s during 2.1 (it was repeated to me
over and over that the kernel should never be compiled with anything but
gcc-2.7.2.3 then), so you can compile 2.2.x with egcs today in the first
place. The only way of going forward is stepping outside the trodden path.
I am not talking here of a critical server, it is machines that are subject
to much other abuse as testbeds. I'm not suicidal yet ;-)
In this particular case, what is being done is wrong (even if it works), so
IMHO it should be fixed. I.e., using a nonstandard compiler flushed out a bug.
