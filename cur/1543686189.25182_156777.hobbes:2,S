No, for all initializers members which are not explicitely initialized are
zero initialized.
Only if you provide no initializer at all, globals/static locals will
still be zero initializers while non-static locals may contain anything.
So, if you write:
struct A { int a; int b; int c; int d; };
void bar (void *);
void foo (void)
{
  struct A a = { .a = 21 };
  bar (&a);
}
then it is the same as:
struct A { int a; int b; int c; int d; };
void bar (void *);
void foo (void)
{
  struct A a = { .a = 21, .b = 0, .c = 0, .d = 0 };
  bar (&a);
}
