How do you guarantee that no tasks are scheduled when you get back to the
hibernated kernel?

Well, not exactly.  If your battery runs out of power while you're suspended,
but you have the image saved, it's still better to restore from the image, even
if something may not work correctly after the restore, than to risk a loss of
data.

See above.
