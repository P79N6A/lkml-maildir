Subject: [RFC] stack check patch for x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hey all,
This patch builds upon the 4KB stack patch by adding a stack check 
debug option.  It is set to trigger if less than 512 bytes of the 
stack are remaining, and hooks into code by means of gcc's -p option, 
which inserts calls to the mcount function.  When an overflow is 
detected, the code switches to a safety stack, and then proceeds 
to dump a backtrace and panic.  Comments?
