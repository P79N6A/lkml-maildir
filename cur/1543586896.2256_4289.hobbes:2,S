noone ever said you had to use stdio.  or even use libc, for that matter!

problems get fixed when there's some pain involved: people bumping 
into a limit, or painfully bad code, etc.  not enough people are 
feeling any pain about the current design.
this (and the "move TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE" workaround) have been known
for years; I think someone even coded up a "grow vmareas down" patch
the last time we all discussed this.

oh, I guess you did the patch ;)
seriously, resubmit it when 2.5 opens up.  the fact is that we currently
have two things that grow up, and one that grows down.  so obviously,
one up-grower must have an arbitrary limit.  switching vma's to down-growing
is a good solution, since it's actually *good* to limit stack growth.  
I wonder whether fortraners still put all their data on the stack;
they wouldn't be happy ;)
a simple workaround would be to turn TASK_UNMAPPED_AREA into a variable,
either system-wide or thread-specific (like ia64 already has!).  that's 
compatible with the improved vmas-down approach, too.
