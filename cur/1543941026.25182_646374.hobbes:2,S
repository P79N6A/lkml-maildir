ok this wants to use some of the page_address() and other helpers from pageattr.c;
that should be easy to solve during integration
(I can even see a more generic version of this function moving there)

can't we do this at compile time?

I would rather keep the split I think and make the trace call explicit
or.. even nicer, we could go fancy and allow the mmio tracer to "subscribe"
to, say, a PCI bar, and auto-enable tracing when the bar gets ioremap'd
about the isntruction decoding.. would be nice if we can share that with kvm
so that we can debug that stuff once ;-)
other than that I think the code is quite nice already, seems getting this merge
ready isn't going to be an enormous deal in terms of complexity
