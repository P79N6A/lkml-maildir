Actually this is definitively the case. 
It is not safe to use cpuid to check the availability of RDTSC in Linux because
the CPU itself does not know if the TSC is buggy (Some MediaGX, some WinChip,..)
or if the TSC on an SMP box is constant across all processors.
Even checking the cpuinfo for the TSC should be done with care, and its far
far better to use gettimeofday unless doing very tiny timings (eg for 
optimising code paths)
