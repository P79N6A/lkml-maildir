I'm having some strange PCI IRQ problems on my new laptop (Panasonic
Toughbook CF-M34UTVZKM) under 2.6.8-1-686 (Debian).  I'm at a loss to
figure out their source, other than the fact that Toughbooks seem to
have a particularly crappy BIOS.
The errors are something like this (taken from default.txt, link below):
irq 9: nobody cared!
 [<c010841a>] __report_bad_irq+0x2a/0x90
 [<c0108510>] note_interrupt+0x70/0xb0
 [<c01087f0>] do_IRQ+0x120/0x130
 [<c0106a20>] common_interrupt+0x18/0x20
 [<c01200fe>] __do_softirq+0x2e/0x80
 [<c01b3b60>] acpi_irq+0x0/0x16
 [<c0120177>] do_softirq+0x27/0x30
 [<c01087cb>] do_IRQ+0xfb/0x130
 [<c0106a20>] common_interrupt+0x18/0x20
 [<c02124a2>] pci_conf1_write+0x92/0xf0
 [<c01b3e86>] acpi_os_write_pci_configuration+0x69/0x76
...
It seems that once some particular piece of PCI hardware gets
initialized, it causes a flood of unexpected interrupts.  The kernel
then disables IRQ 9, which basically breaks most of my devices because
that's the one they all share.
I captured the following boots for different command lines.  The ACPI
and non-ACPI cases die at different points, but with the same result.

Could someone who knows more than me about PCI IRQs take a quick look
at those dumps and tell me if there's anything obvious that I'm
missing, or some way to work around the problem?
