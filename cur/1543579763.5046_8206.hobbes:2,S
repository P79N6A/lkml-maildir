I checked RFC793, and AFAICS Solaris is the culprit:
it sends out invalid packets, Linux ignores them and thus Linux doesn't
receive acks.
Which Solaris version do you use?
* The last valid ack from the Solaris computer is for byte 1583721, win
8760 (line 2078)
* No packet after line 2078 from the Solaris computer passed the
acceptability test from RFC793, page 69. Thus Linux ignores these
packets completely.
* Linux sends out packets up to 1591021:1592481(1460) without receiving
_valid_ acks, then it begins to retry 1583721:1585181(1460) every 2
seconds until the end of the tcpdump.
