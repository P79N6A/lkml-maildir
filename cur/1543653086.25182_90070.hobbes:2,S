I have tested this patch running oprofile on a dual box at 150,000
ints/sec and more, with nmi_watchdog=0,1,2, and couldn't reproduce any
problems.
One thing: since we have the unnatural relationship between the watchdog
and oprofile, I would much prefer that be obvious in the priority. e.g
MAX_NMI_PRIORITY, which oprofile uses, then watchdog is MAX_NMI_PRIORITY
-1. Currently the gap between the two values you use indicates it's OK
to have another handler inbetween, which it definitely isn't.
