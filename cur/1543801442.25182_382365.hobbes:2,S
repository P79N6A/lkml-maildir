First and fore most users want simple things like for example playing  
an mp3 file to just work.
Your concept that very many of them are interested in the high end  
"features" of hardware you assume to be modern is wrong. Did you ever  
notice that sound cards got just reduced to a simple AD/DA converter  
combination? Modern hardware is frequently actually MUCH MUCH simpler  
then old one used to be in this area.

The existence of /dev/sound doesn't prohibit the existence of
/dev/bells_and_wistles (without any chance to work with anything else  
then the vendors specific software).
That was precisely the situation with my sam9700 card....

Your assumption about "all circumstances" is misguided. There is no  
requirement for one size fits all here.
Look most people drive cars and not space shuttles.

If hearing just the mp3 would just simply work with the alsa drivers  
without getting in to too much hassle
with AC97 sound cards, which usually don't even include hardware  
based volume controls nowadays, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have to  
"take this shit". And you should remember the bold announcements they  
did make in first place.

It clutters the application programming part very successfully.
BTW. Designing a sound API toward DMA, like ALSA does, is just plain  
well beyond any hope...
