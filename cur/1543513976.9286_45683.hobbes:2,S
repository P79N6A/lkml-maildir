It turns out that it is a vmware thing..
Apparently vmware uses the /dev/parport* devices for bi-directional printing.
Somehow even after I have uninstalled there software from my system there is
still a reference on my system to /dev/parport.
my filters point to /dev/lp0 but when I execute lpr it is referencing
/dev/parport.   The modules from vmware have been removed from my system, as well
as vmware.
Thanks, but this IS a vmware bug, and anyone using vmware should be cautioned on
how this software can screw up your system with there none standard way of doing
things.
