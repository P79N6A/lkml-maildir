Well ... you're not.
You've deleted the definition of rtc_fops for no reason I can tell.
You put an unlock_kernel() on every place that invokes break;.  You
should instead have put an unlock_kernel() before every return;.
You needed to put a lock_kernel() at the beginning of rtc_ioctl().
You needed to adjust the prototype of rtc_ioctl().
Honestly, if your C skills are as weak as they seem to be, you may be
better off trying to gain experience with some other project -- the
patch you sent appeared to be simple cargo-cult programming, and we
don't need that kind of contribution.
