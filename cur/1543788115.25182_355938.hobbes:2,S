Well, I believe it is okay for suspend.

Yes, it would help. (But notice that I have proof-of-concenpt ready in
sw3 tree :-).

It is quite a lot of ugly code, and being in kernel does not really
help. swsusp_free() will need to be exported, but we need it for
normal (non-error) code path, too, so that should not be big problem.
