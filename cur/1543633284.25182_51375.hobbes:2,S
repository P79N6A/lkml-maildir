For one, enumerate them. Network interfaces, as opposed to sockets, are  
fairly static. And currently I have to either call /sbin/ifconfig or  
figure out where this information is hidden in /proc. (And there is a  
kernel interface, I think, some ioctl() stuff - I have mostly forgotten  
all I learned about that, it was so ugly.)
Doesn't need to be /dev/xxx nodes (that *would* be the traditional Unix  
way) - these days I'd argue for a special network device fs.

On the other hand, pipe() is about *anonymous* files. You could in fact  
argue that it would be nice to have an interface for anonymous disk files  
as well, instead of all the current acrobatics for safe temp file  
creation.

Especially not if your argument is then about situations where you atually  
don't want a name.
See, the problem with eth0 and friends is that they already *have* names -  
their names just aren't in the standard namespace. *That* is the real  
problem here.
Unix tradition or not, I propose the rule:
*Any kernel object that has a text name, shall appear,*
*under this name, somewhere in the filesystem.*
Or in other words, *there can only be one namespace*. (Well, only one  
global namespace, anyway.)
