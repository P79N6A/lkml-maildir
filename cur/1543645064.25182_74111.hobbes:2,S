Sure, the 6.01b5 tarball can be found at:
	
http://download.qlogic.com/drivers/5642/qla2x00-v6.1b5-dist.tgz
In general all QLogic drivers are available from the following URL:
	
http://www.qlogic.com/support/drivers_software.asp
In my mind, a larger question is determining a balance between the 
'Release Early, release often' mantra of Linux development and the 
'kinder, more conservative pace' of business.  For example, If we 
cannot setup a 'patch/pre-beta' web-site locally at QLogic, I've 
considered starting a SourceForge project or hosting it locally 
through my ISP.
