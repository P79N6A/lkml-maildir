I'm not a fan of patching defconfig's this way - this will only bring 
tons of patch conflicts (consider what happens when anyone already has
a completely updated defconfig in his tree and your patch goes in first).
What you do manually already happens automatically when a maintainer 
updates a defconfig.
And for not regularly updated defconfigs one obsolete option more or 
less does not matter at all - even more since apart from a warning 
there's anyway no problem.
