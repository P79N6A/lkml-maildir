It seems that this is a problem caused by the way we check for
compiler options in x86_64.  Each compiler flag is checked for
individually and if available added to cflags-y, later that is
added to CFLAGS.  However, this means that each flag is checked
in total isolation.  On x86_64 (on this compiler at least) the
-mpreferred-stack-boundary and -m{32,64} flags are actually mutually
dependant, the alignment constraints vary based on the word size.
This leads to the compile failure:
    # gcc -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -S -xc /dev/null  -o FOO
    # echo $?
    0
    # gcc -m64 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -S -xc /dev/null  -o FOO
    /dev/null:1: error: -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 is not between 4 and 12
    # echo $?
    1
In the main Makefile we always add each flag directly to CFLAGS
which means we check them all in combination, perhaps this is
prudent here also?  Either way I suspect that changing the -m64
check to add itself directly to CFLAGS will fix this us.
