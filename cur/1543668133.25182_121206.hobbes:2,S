Yes, but the bug manifests very shortly after starting the
kernel. I am 99% sure that it happens before init is even
started.
For a split second after the kernel starts, I am still able
to use
the Fn key. Then, all the sudden, I cannot. I am running
Debian
Sid, and I notice the modules loading about when this bug
manifests
itself. Even if I make my modules not load, the bug still
manifests
itself.
Thanks, Warren
