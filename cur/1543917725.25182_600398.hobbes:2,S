noapictimer really doesn't make any sense on non SMP imho with the old
timer architecture. That is why I never bothered to implement it.
It's purely a UP hack.

There is nothing really to fix currently.  Clockevents changes behaviour
majorly (always using APIC timers without irq 0 backups[1]) and that causes
problems that need new workarounds and new fixes (surprise surprise!)
That merge would probably fix a few more such "Thomas doesn't understand
the code" bugs I guess because he hacks much more on i386 than x86-64;
but if the overall result will be really better is a totally different
question.

aka put all eggs in one basket. Given the trends in CPU power saving that
is a quite dangerous strategy.
