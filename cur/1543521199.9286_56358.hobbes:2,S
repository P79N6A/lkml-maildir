I have been looking for somethink like that. Has anyone seen something
like it? The time_t type works for now for what it is intended to do -
interact with the operating system. It is also (ab)used to hold time
information inside an application because it is so standard and always
present. Unfortunatly, whereas the os seldom handles timestamps way into
the future applications do.
