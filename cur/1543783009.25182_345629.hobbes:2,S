Take it easy. Don't kill __check_region() unless you first convert all
users of it.
And by removing __check_region() you've just broken check_region() -
There are still some drivers left that use check_region() and there's
no reason to break them.
The right approach is to identify all users of
check_region()/__check_region(), then submit patches to convert them
to use request_region instead. *Then*, when there are no more
in-kernel users left, submit patches to remove the deprecated
functions.
