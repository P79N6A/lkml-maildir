this is a mystery case which i once tried to remote-debug and fix, gave up
after some 50 patches or so ... This is the only box which i know we
should be able to boot on SMP, but we dont currently.
i have some new ideas since then but success is not guaranteed :) One
thing you could try is my 10000-threads patch, it initializes CPUs much
more conservatively and as a side-effect it could fix the above bug too.
another thing to try is to recompile the recently released LILO with the
SMALL_SEGMENTS (or something like that) option, LILO has a remote chance
to corrupt the mptable and associated per-CPU data ...

(thats just a side-effect, we simply do not do the SMP-IPI stuff correctly
when one of the CPUs has failed. You could get it booting with some
patches, but it's just not worth it, the other 3 CPUs are not responding.)
if everything fails, let me know, there are a couple of more things to try
;) I'd really love to get that box booting properly.
