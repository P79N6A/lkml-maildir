Least astonishment in this case would mean that the binary has the
capabilities available to its EUID.  In the case of a SUID binary
the EUID is the UID of the owner of the binary.
This is the reason for SUID binaries.
Non-SUID binaries get their EUID from the UID of the user
running the binary.  So they can only have capabilities that
are available to that user. 
If a binary requires a capability to run to do its job
then it either needs to be run by a user that has that
capability or it needs to be SUID to a user that does.
SUID binaries should _still_ be rare, but since they 
will not all be SUID-root the potential security
risk will be reduced.
