Select might make some sort of sense for sequential access to files,
and for random access via lseek/read but it makes no sense at all for
pread and pwrite where select() has no idea _which_ part of the file
the user is going to want to access next.

Select can work if the access is sequential, but async IO is a more
general solution.
