  I take patches :-)
But I think it misses the really good point of inotify as I see
it, i.e. there is no need anymore of a daemon outside the application
space, in practice I would rather see inotify plugged at the gnome-vfs
level. The reason is that you will just need to monitor the inotify
file descriptor, which is easy to do at the gnome-vfs level since you
have glib and loop access, while in libgamin this would either require
disabling dnotify if inotify is available (FAM has only one fd registered
at the application layer), or use the daemon for inotify too.
The only advantage of using the daemon would be for advanced features
like congestion control, which are not available (yet ?) in gamin.
  inotify sounds good to me, I hope it won't be bounced by the kernels
people.
