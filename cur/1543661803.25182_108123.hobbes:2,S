Subject: a race condition in SMP TLB flushing code?

We were chasing a bug in MIPS/SMP TLB part, and noticed that
i386 may have a race condition in the same area.
Here is the scenario how it may happen:
cpu A:
        call flush_tlb_mm()
        find out cpu_vm_mask set for cpu B (cpu_mask != 0)
cpu B:
        inside schedule(), calling switch_mm()
        clear cpu_vm_mask bit for current mm, trying
        stop ipi for flushing tlb
cpu A:
        oops, but it is a little too late.  already
        checked cpu_vm_mask, and send an ipi to cpu B for
        flushing tlb anyway.
cpu B:
        get the ipi and (WITHOUT CHECKING cpu_vm_mask again)
        go ahead doing tlb flushing.
I am not sure if any disastrous result will happen, but apparently
an unintended flush has happened.  In MIPS such a hole could
cause two processes using the same TLB entries which yields all kinds
of interesting crashes.
BTW, I am looking at the 2.4.19 kernel.  Please cc your reply to my
email address.  Thanks.
