Right. The optimizer proves equivalence of terms and exchange the
one that are bad for the optimization goal (e.g performance,
speed, size) against the one that works more towards this goal.
Everything else is an optimizer BUG, which should be reported and
fixed.
The C{89,99} standard now defines the syntax and semantics of
theses terms. 
Relevant for the optimizer: possible values of terms, assumptions
made on the static and dynamic behavior of these terms (add
anything I forgot).
So the optimizer should NEVER cause trouble if you write
completely valid C{89,99} and the compiler and environment
implement 100% of the semantics of it.
Compiler specific features should be seen as an addition to the
standard on this compiler. They follow the same rules stated
above.
