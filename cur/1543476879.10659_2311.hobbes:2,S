I disagree.  How many Linux device drivers will there ever be?  Maybe
a thousand or two?  Compare that number to the programmer population,
and you'll see that it's not necessary to drop below the top one or
two percentiles to find those who'll write the very best drivers.

Um, no comment.  :-)

There are ways to make sure that such declarations _are_ made for kernel
drivers.  I'll go into them if you like.
