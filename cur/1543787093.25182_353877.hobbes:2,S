Perhaps I should have dropped the old Subject completely, despite the
topic I brought up being related to what was discussed.  I am talking
about PID reuse related issues in userspace apps that appear to require
an additional kernel interface to be resolved.

Not really.  For example, the kernel currently has no idea, and no
reliable way to find out, that killall(1) has taken note of a PID and is
about to kill it.

That would work for certain in-kernel issues.
If we would let userspace apps lock PIDs like that, there would be added
DoS risk that would need to be dealt with (e.g., by letting a process
lock only one other PID - provided that the PID space is sufficiently
large that having a half of it locked is not a problem).  But I do not
see a reason to go for that complexity.  My proposal avoids it.
(A hash table could be used along with my proposal as well to speed
things up, but it would not affect _allocation_ of PIDs.  Rather, only
the "locking" process's view would be affected by the "lock".)
