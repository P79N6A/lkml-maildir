This is your suprise argument, right?  (Not my current problem).
Actually this is only changing weither file.o gets considered in
causing the build command to be executed.

The issue is I need headers copied for some of the files.  The current
approach is any file that might need a copied header gets a dependency
on all of the copied .h files.  I was planning on coping some more
headers used in different files.  if_changed_dep
The issue is specifically COPYFILES.  The .o can not be built until
its dependencys are met, but it never exists itself.  The actual .h
files a given source will be detected by if_changed_dep and fixdep.

Sure.  I'm reposting the series, I'll cc you and copy the makefile
patch to linux-kernel, its 3/5.    That patch is independent of 1 and 2 
while 4 and 5 require them.  The full series is available on the 
linuxppc-dev mailing list.
