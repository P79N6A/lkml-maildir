I could not find a way to explain that strange pattern either. With CBC it
would have to result in total mess if just one bit is flipped. Probably
read/writing is handled with different sized bio_vec.. no idea.
cipher_null does not ignore the IV. The CBC processing takes place no matter
what mapping function (aka electronic codebook) is used. The fact that
cipher_null is an identity mapping does not stop CBC.

That's done anyway. Per convention the transformation module is allowed to
increase the IV every 512 bytes. The IV parameter is only the initial
initial vector ;).

Nice! It's definitely a feature worth merging. loop.c used to be the place
where to put this stuff, but why not replace it by newer in-kernel
techniques?

If you can't get attention for your patch, try to convince someone "more
important". DM maintainer is a good place to start :)
