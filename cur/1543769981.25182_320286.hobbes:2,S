Hi list members,
After a failure of compilation of the similar code snippet
u64 mconst = somebig64bitvalue;
u64 tmp = some32bitvalue;
u64 r = mconst / tmp;
I encounter compilation error and gcc reporting __udivdi3 has not been
found!
After firing up cscope I found that this function has never(?) been
implemented for
x86 architecture. How is it possible that during compilation process of
some module
make system tries to link with nonexisting function?
I've also found a do_div() and it was sufficent for my purposes but Im
still curious about
__udivdi3. Can someone explain this issue to me?
