True.

Well no.  Because the filtered-whatsit takes two spinlocks and does a bunch
of arith for each and every task, each time it calls try_to_free_pages(). 
The frequency of that could be very high indeed, even when nobody is
interested in the metric which is being maintained(!).
And I'd suggest that only a minority of workloads would be interested in
this metric?
ergo, polling the thing once per five seconds in those situations where we
actually want to poll the thing may well be cheaper, in global terms?
