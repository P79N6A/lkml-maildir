Hi,
on 2.4 kernels fcntl-based file locking does not work with 
clone-based threads as expected (by me): two threads of the same process 
can acquire exclusive lock on a file at the same time.
flock()-based locks work as expected, i.e. only one thread can have an 
exclusive lock at a time.
What would it take to make fcntl work as flock?
Please cc me, I'm not subscribed.
Thanks
