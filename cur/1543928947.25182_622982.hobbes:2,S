I don't understand. How could the compiler create the mask at
compile-time when "offset" is only known at runtime?
Anyway, I just checked and gcc (4.1.2 on x86_86) generates the same
code for both expressions, so there's not much to argue about. David,
feel free to ignore my comment if you prefer your implementation :)
