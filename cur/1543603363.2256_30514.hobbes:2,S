Right.  Given current uptimes and being optimistic the fix for y2038 
is probably needed by 2030 or just a little later.  But in any case
64 bit systems should be maxing out by then, and the conversion to 128
bit systems should have already happened on the server side.  32 bit
systems will likely be limited to embedded and legacy systems by then.
