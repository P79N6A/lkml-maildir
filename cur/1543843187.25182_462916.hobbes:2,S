The current Linux behavior does seem to be consistent with the way
recent BSD and OSX seem to work. Solaris 8 seems to behave consistent
with the patch I posted.
Most of the RFC's I've looked at don't seem to have much to say about
how multicasting works at the socket level. Is there an RFC or
specification that spells this out, or is this one of those situations
where things are somewhat open to interpretation?
Thanks,
Jeff
