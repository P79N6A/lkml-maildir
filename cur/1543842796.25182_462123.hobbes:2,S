It definitely is caused by lack of memory barriers before the writel().
IBM, Anton, and all of us know about this.  TSO probably makes it more
susceptible because you write to many buffer descriptors before you
issue one writel() to DMA all the descriptors.  The large number of
TSO descriptors makes re-ordering more likely.
