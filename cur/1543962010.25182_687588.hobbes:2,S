Hello; I ran into a problem, for some reason with adding:
acpi_device_dir(device) = device_dir;
I received:
acpi_video_device_aqdd_fs:   implicit declaration of function acpi_device
lvalue required as left operand of assignment =  after these errors, as a test
I went in and put /*acpi_device_dir(device); */ around that line then
recompiled, compiling went o.k., then rebooting
I'm not seeing any messages like before.
regards;
