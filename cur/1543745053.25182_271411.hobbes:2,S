The tree is in "bugfix only" mode right now.  Changes like this need to
wait for 2.6.10 to come out before I can send it upward.
So, care to hold on to it for a while?  Or I can add it to my "to apply
after 2.6.10 comes out" tree, which will mean it will end up in the -mm
releases till that happens.
thanks,
