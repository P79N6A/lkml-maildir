Kernel already does that correctly, and follows KBUILD_OUTPUT env variable
that points to where user wants the object tree. No changes needed to
external module build scripts.
Maybe you SUSE guys just didn't realize that.

This is cool and desirable, but does not need or even justify
breaking/redirecting the 'build' symlink elsewhere.

It is not a proposal. It has been in mainline since 2.5.x kernels and last
time I checked, it worked fine.

The person compiling kernel decides where he wants the object tree. He only
needs to set that once, before builing a kernel with separate object and
source trees. And same env variable works just fine when used with
externally compiled modules.
