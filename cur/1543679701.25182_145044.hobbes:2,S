That depends on the number of Oracle processes you have.
Say that page tables need 0.1% of the space of the virtual
space they map.  With 1000 Oracle users you'd end up needing
as much memory in page tables as your shm segment is large.
Of course, in this situation either the application should
use large pages or the kernel should simply reclaim the
page tables (possible while holding the mmap_sem for write).

Agreed on that.  Please let the monstrosity die together
with 32 bit machines ;)
