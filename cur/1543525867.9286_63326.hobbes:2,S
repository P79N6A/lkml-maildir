hi again all,
maybe I'm stupid but after testing 2.3.xx kernel again and again, I'm still
unable to create a boot/root-floppy with a compressed or uncompressed
root-image. (mounting floppy directly as root works)
I've posted this mailing 2 times, but I've got no answer. I can't believe, that
I'm the only one, who needs a boot/root-floppy......
if there is anybody outside, who has done so, please send me an e-mail.
my last tries are to put the root-image into an uncompressed fsfile. here
are the results:
RAMDISK Minix filesystem found at block 0
RAMDISK Loading 800 blocks [1 disk] into ram disk.... done.
Freeing initrd memory: 0k freed!
kernel BUG at block_dev.c: 425!       <<<<===========================
invalid operand:0000
CPU:0 
.......
this is what happens when I try a compressed image on a floppy from outside the
minix-filesystem:

the "f_op" seems to be uninitialized - when I use the same disk and the same
image, but a 2.2.14-kernel, it works.
