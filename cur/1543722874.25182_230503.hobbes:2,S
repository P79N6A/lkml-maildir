Ah, excellent. See - I have no memory.
No - I keep repeating: please stop this geometry nonsense.
This is something entirely different. Linux does automatic partition recognition.
That of course is bad, especially if there is no partition table at all, like on
certain ZIP drives and memory cards for digital cameras (that behave like
big floppies). In order to guess right more often the kernel now only believes
that something is a valid DOS-type partition table when there is a valid
bootable flag indicator (0 or 0x080).
You had garbage there (or at least an unusual value) - and the garbage was harmless,
but now causes the kernel to reject this table.
Remains the question: do you have any idea from where you got this unusual value?
