The page allocator maintains a number of bitmaps, but anyway. Each
subsystem will basically have its own cache-hot structures. Instead
of passing around metadata that's hot, each tries to keep its own
"working set" of metadata hot. Basically yes, it will work better in
some situations and the current metadata passing will work better in
others. I'd expect the control over the layout to be more advantageous
more often, especially since it arranges cache contiguity while pages
are in use.

That does sound convenient. I'll add that to the list of benefits.
