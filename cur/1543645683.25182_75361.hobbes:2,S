Aww, shucks!  I guess I'd better have a go at your next problem...

Looks to me like flush_tlb_mm is faulting on the vma->vm_mm given it.
And looks to me like mprotect_fixup, in the merge case, may be passing
an already freed vma to change_protection.  I'm not as confident about
this patch as the earlier one, but I believe it's correct: please
give it a try, and maybe Christoph will confirm or deny it.
