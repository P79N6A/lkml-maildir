I wouldn't expect it to. Most people use ATA for that, and it tends to 
have lower limits than most SCSI HBA's (well, at least the old PATA), so 
the change - if any - should at most change some of the sg.c limits to be 
no less than what SG_IO has had on ATA forever.
Not that I expect people to have a SCSI CD/DVD drive anyway in this day 
and age, so the sg.c changes probably won't show up at all.
The problem that was reported was apparently for a rather special use.
