We should be performing lowmem page reclaim, but we're not.  With some
highmem/lowmem size combinations the `incremental min' logic in the page
allocator will prevent __GFP_HIGHMEM allocations from taking ZONE_NORMAL
below pages_high and kswapd then does not perform page reclaim in the
lowmem zone at all.  I'm seeing some workloads where we reclaim 700 highmem
pages for each lowmem page.  This hugely exacerbated the slab problem on
1.5G machines.  I have that fixed up now.
Regardless of that, we do, logically, want to reclaim slab in response to
highmem reclaim pressure because any highmem allocation can be satisfied by
lowmem too.
