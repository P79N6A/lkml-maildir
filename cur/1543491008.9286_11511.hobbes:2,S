I really think that you are unfair to the journalist. He tried to
explain different sides´ views and the incident setting, and then went
on to offer a opinion about that issue, clearly marked as personal
statement.
Disclaimer: I do not remember specific articles authored by that
journalist, only the current article that we are discussing.

P.S.: The most interesting part of the article was for me referencing
GNOME´s ability to work with several desktops as a new or worthy
feature. I would never dream of selling this as "chief visual
characteristic". This clearly shows how far apart my "Linux mindset" is
from the Windows mainstream. (And what the main audience for that
article seems to be.)
