Some of them are certainly not very serious in their effects. I get this
persistently, once every couple of months, on one of my machines (an
Athlon 4 with 768Mb of ECC RAM):
kernel: MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
kernel: Bank 2: 940040000000017a
and I think it *is* a single slightly wobbly bit (the wobble being too
slight for memtest to find).
Nothing discernible has ever gone wrong as a result of that, right down
to repeated GCC enable-checking bootstrap-and-tests completing without
error (well, without any more than the expected XFAILs).
(I'm just *assuming* the `Bank 2' in this message refers to a bank of
RAM. Doubtless this assumption will now be shown to be utterly wrong and
a sign of terminal foolishness on my part... ;) )
