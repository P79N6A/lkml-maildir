Thanks, and I'll try to do that once I've got things sorted (I discovered the
root cause of the problem was unsupported firmware version, though the oops is
unacceptable anyway:).
My current problem is finding out whether I can just pop in new roms with the
3.51 firmware and still have the DEC SRM software still work
(KZPSC-UX/KZPAC-XF). The needed sockets are there on the main board but that
doesn't mean the DEC firmware will work with 3.51 (the current firmware is
2.49).
