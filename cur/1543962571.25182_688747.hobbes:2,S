Some sparc32 cleanups triggered by some gcc-4.3 warnings
I saw there.
More fixes to syscall restart handling, I think I have it
right now and I haven't seen any weird behavior for a few
days.
All the sparc serial drivers were using the same driver
name string, resulting in all kinds of problems which
the kernel now duly warns about.
Similarly wrt. sparc64 PCI host controller registry.
Just don't try to make the dummy root host controller
and all the problems go away.
Please pull, thanks a lot!
