In theory -- yes, on practice it'll be useless. You can not do call to APM
functions while more then one processors are active or APIC is used. So before
every call to APM you should stop all processors except main one -- it's not
fast procedure. Then and result will be total mess in kernel and VERY slow
system. Id does not worth it IMO ...
