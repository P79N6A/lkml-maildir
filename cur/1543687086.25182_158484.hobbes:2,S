Are you saying that one CPU can't saturate the memory bus?  Or maybe we're
hitting something on the CPU bus, or just that SMP will change the timings
and stress things differently?  Or that if memtest doesn't test from the
second CPU then it could be a faulty cpu/L2?
Grr, has anything been done to verify the hardware is running withing specs
and isn't too hot?
