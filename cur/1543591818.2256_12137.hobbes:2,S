Yup.  The problem is that you're trying to measure scalability in performance
of an i/o-bound task by comparing a machine with greater i/o resource but less
processing power with one with greater processing but poorer i/o.  Surprisingly
enough, the one with the best i/o wins.  This isn't really a fair comparison
between the two platforms.
If you put the same disk array on both machines and got the same results, then
you'd have a point.
My point was that in the real world having this configuration for a webserver
is unlikely to be sensible at all.
