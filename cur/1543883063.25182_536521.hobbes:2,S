This behavior has been in Linux and sort of official since the early
2.4.X days - remember the discussion on fsync()ing directory changes for
MTAs that led to the mount option "dirsync" for ext?fs so that rename(),
link() and stuff like that became synchronous even without fsync()ing
the parent directory? I can look up archive references if need be.
Surely four years ago, if not five (this is from the top of my head, not
a quotable fact I verified from the LKML archives though).

It's not as though I'd recommend reiserfs. I have seen one major
corruption recently in openSUSE 10.2 with ext3, but I've had constant
headaches with reiserfs since the day it went into S.u.S.E. kernels at
the time until I switched away from reiserfs some years ago.
