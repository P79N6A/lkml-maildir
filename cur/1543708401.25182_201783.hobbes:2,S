Let's leave the af_ipmi code out for now.  I'd like to get some opinions 
on it, though.

I will rework these.  These used to be much smaller, but newer hardware 
needed larger sizes.

Will do.

These are only accessed when the sequence number lock is held, so they 
should be ok.

Argh!  I'll get that fixed one of these days :)

Ok, I'll fix that.

I'll ask the person who wrote this about it.

Well, yes.  That's so if people add the high-res timer patch, this

Yes, true.

Ok.
