I've actually never seen one or the changer I had didn't support it (it was
an nec 6x 4disc)

If you tell me what line, i'll add it into 2.2.13pre18 and try it on a
machien I have at work.

Actually, I'll agree with him.  load module for scsi card before ide-scsi. 
found a 5disc changer on the scsi card, ok, scd[0-4] is that changer.  Load
ide-scsi and then see 6-8 devices for the same ide cdrom.  This is what he
meant by screwed for now.
