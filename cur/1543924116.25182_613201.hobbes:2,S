Any uninitialized field in a static section (.data or .bss) is 
guaranteed to be initialized to zero.  This is guaranteed by the C 
standard.  In the former case, it is the responsibility of the compiler 
and in the latter by the runtime.
The Linux percpu handling creates a .data.percpu section which is then 
replicated into each of the CPU data blocks; thus, percpu data counts as 
static data for this purpose, and initialization is guaranteed.
