I've seen this comment before too, and I still think it says it best:
The full release s/b the last rc with NO changes other than its name.
Now we are faced with a final that may have another 50k+ of patches 
applied over what made the rc5.  IMO, in the immediately past case, 
that should not have been final, but an rc6.
I personally vote for going back to the -pre series where we get to 
test new ideas & maybe morph the neighbors dog/cat.  At some point it 
gets stable enough to call it -rc1, at which point nothing but 
bugfixes should be allowed in until the final.  That way we have a 
develop, then stabilize, then develop the next, then stabilize it set 
of stairsteps.
I personally build and run as many of them as I can find the time to 
do.  I just applied the bk-1394-patch and its building because 2.6.11 
isn't really comfortable running my movie camera yet.
I also haven't built any more of Andrews -mm's since the last time I 
got told off about it.  I can go back to doing that too, if the 
results of my testing it aren't going to be thrown out like the babys 
bath water.
