I don't know of anything actually meant to report mapping occupancy
(except full RSS) before or after this patch. Or have I blundered?

Hmm, that could get hairy depending on how we want them grouped. It
might be better just to maintain RSS counters for the kinds of mappings
we're interested in. Doing pagetable walks to make splitvma() do that
right could perform poorly. Otherwise we'd have to find another
instance of the same kind of thing to "donate" our RSS to on unmap.
Cheers,
