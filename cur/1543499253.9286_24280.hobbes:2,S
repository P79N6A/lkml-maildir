I agree that it's _ugly_, but it's equally ugly that we currently may
block due out of request slots, without being able to start I/O on the
second blockdevice.
Said that, did you verifyied that you really lost performances under high
I/O load using two block devices? (as just said I agree with you about the
theory)
