Ok, it seems everyone is way confused here.  This is what I was thinking
of when I suggested using the firmware code:
	- module loads and registers with firmware core doing the
	  "request_firmware_nowait" call.
	- a hotplug event gets generated that everyone just ignores
	  (because it isn't really a big deal.)
	- At some point, the user copies the firmware to the sysfs file
	  because they want to update their bios.
	- the module is then told that firmware is present and it does
	  something with it.
Note, that between step 2 and 3, it could be _days_ or _months_.  No
need to touch any hotplug scripts at all.
Does this make more sense now?  It seems pretty simple to me...
thanks,
