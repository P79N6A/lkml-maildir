I'm not sure what WRT means, but your last Linux SATA Update did contain:
"Hotplug support
---------------
All SATA is hotplug.
libata does not support hotplug... yet.
The following SATA controllers will never support hotplug:
Intel ICH5, Intel ICH5-R, Intel ICH6 (non-AHCI), Pacific Digital Talon,
Promise SATA SX4."
