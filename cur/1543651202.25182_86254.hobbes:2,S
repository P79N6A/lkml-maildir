	<shrug> that can be done without doing anything to filesystem.
Namely, turn current "nosuid" of vfsmount into a mask of capabilities.
Then use bindings instead of links.  *Note* - binary _is_ marked suid,
mask tells which capabilities _not_ to gain.  It's OK - attempt to
link(2) to the thing using binding will see that oldname and newname
are within different vfsmounts, so instead of link to suid-root binary
you get -EXDEV.
	And that works on any fs, can be made per-user and can be _seen_
by admin - bindings are visible in /proc/mounts (yes, I remember that
we need to fix the crap with pathnames).
	I can do that thing in a weekend - it's trivial to implement.
No need to bugger filesystems for that.
