Assuming that a  struct pollfd *  points to a page of pollfds, and fds is
an array of pointers, this is still wrong, e.g. assume nfds = 1,
sizeof(void *) = 4, POLLFD_PER_PAGE any value >= 2.
The original version yields a correct result and even seems a bit clearer,
unless nfds-1 becomes unsigned. In that case, something like
(nfds+POLLFD_PER_PAGE-1)/POLLFD_PER_PAGE*sizeof(struct pollfd *)
should help.
