Hi,
commit d6ece5491ae71ded1237f59def88bcd1b19b6f60 breaks acpi for my
Medion MD 95600 (aka MSI S260) notebook.

|    [PATCH] i386/x86-64 Correct for broken MCFG tables on K8 systems
| 
|    They report all busses as MMCONFIG capable, but it never works for the
|    internal devices in the CPU's builtin northbridge.
| 
|    It just probes all func 0 devices on bus 0 (the internal northbridge is
|    currently always on bus 0) and if they are not accessible using MCFG they are
|    put into a special fallback bitmap.
| 
|    On systems where it isn't we assume the BIOS vendor supplied correct MCFG.
| 
|    Requires the earlier patch for mmconfig type1 fallback
After this patch I can only boot with "acpi=off". Before this commit
I could boot with "pci=noacpi acpi_sleep=s3_bios resume=/dev/hda2"
without an oops. Unfortunately 
  git revert d6ece5491ae71ded1237f59def88bcd1b19b6f60
does not work without merge conflict on top-of-kernel.

There you will also find dmesg, config , lspci and lspci -vv with the
latest good commit 928cf8c62763349efc550a12f6518e52c3390906
My notebook is a "Medion MD 95600" (sometimes called "SIM 2100" or "SIM
2010"). It's actually a "MSI S260".  You may find more information for
this notebook on the tuxmobil page.
