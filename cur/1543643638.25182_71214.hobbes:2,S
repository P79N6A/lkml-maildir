That's an implementation detail and it's not clear we should be exposing it 
to the user. It's not entirely insane to contemplate socket->socket or 
file->file sendfile either -- would we invent new system calls for those 
too? File descriptors are file descriptors.

Yeah -- I'll add it to the TODO list. Scheduled for some time in 2007 :)
More seriously though, I'd hope that whoever implemented what you call 
'sys_receivefile' would solve this issue, as 'sys_receivefile' isn't really 
useful as anything more than a handy nomenclature for describing the 
process in question.
