What userspace are you talking about? There is one main user - X, for it 
and all the rest you could provide a simple input library.

If the kernel would do it properly, you would have a point...

That's not the problem. Your keycode mapping has no idea about alternative 
mappings. How does the application know that "Shift"+"2" may mean '"' or 
'@'?
