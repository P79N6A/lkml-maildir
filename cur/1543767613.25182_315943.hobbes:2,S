Could you be more specific on "some specification", and convince us that
what you read wasn't in fact wrong about things?

Well, creating a new file implies creating a new entry in the directory
pointing at the inode, which is "appending" to the directory.  So this
isn't at all surprising, and I'd consider the spec that says "create or modify"
to be broken.
Were you possibly thinking of the +t (sticky) bit on a directory, which when
set restricts who can unlink the file?
