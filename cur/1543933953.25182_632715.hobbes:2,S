I've never seen code which would do that, and it was not suggested by any
tutorial I ever saw. I'd expect any machine to break on all kinds of software
if it required this. The only thing I remember being warned about is writing
the index and the data register at the same time using outw, because that
would write both registers at the same time on 16-bit-cards.
BTW: The error function in linux-2.6.23/arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c
uses while(1) without cpu_relax() in order to halt the machine. Is this fixed?
Should it be fixed?
