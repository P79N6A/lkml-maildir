I have a better suggestion.  How about we make write(2) on /dev/console to
act as printk()?  IOW, how about making _all_ writes to console show up in
dmesg?
Then we don't need anything special to do logging _and_ we get output
of init scripts captured.  For free.  dmesg(8) would pick that up, klogd(8)
will work as is, etc.
Linus?
