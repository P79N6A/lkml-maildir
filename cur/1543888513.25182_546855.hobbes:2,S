OK, I see.

Why?

Not sure I understand. When we call _cpu_down() after device_suspend(), we
check tasks_frozen == 1, and do not call freeze_processes(). If the task
could be frozen, it is already frozen.
When _cpu_down() sees tasks_frozen = 0, it does freeze_processes() itself,
and thaw_tasks() on return.
IOW, we never send (say) CPU_DEAD, always CPU_DEAD_FROZEN.
Wouldn't fly?
Oleg.
