AFAIK there is only one version that supports compiling to amd64 (only 
one for debian anyway) - I'm on 3.3.2-0pre4.biarch1.  It is a bit flaky 
(in 32bit it'll happily do a make -j255 without worrying... going to 64 
bit needs about 10 attempts to do a single compile because it keeps 
falling over with internal compiler errors/segfaults/etc.).
The problem with a brand new architecture is until the toolset 
stabliizes I have to cross my fingers and hope.  Certainly if it's 
compiling dodgy code it'll explain why Alsa is about as stable as a 
drunk in a high wind...
OK I'll forget it for now & go back to 32bit for a couple of months then 
try again.
