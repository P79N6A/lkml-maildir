You have to initialize (once, on boot) this to
something. I don't really see the point of initializing
it to zero and putting the atime/mtime on a few entries
back to 1970, when we have the value there already.
We /know/ we have to use the RTC values for things
like apm suspend, for instance - I don't want my 'make'
to be broken through races with userspace time functions -
so if we are prepared to read RTC on resume, we should be
prepared to read RTC on boot.
