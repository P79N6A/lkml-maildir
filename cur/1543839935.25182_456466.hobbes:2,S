Thats a loader problem. It ties directly in with things like relocatable
kernels. Arjan has been systematically working to get us "const" objects
and that needs to continue, and the more we can enforce it the more
security we get and the more bugs we catch.
It's also a mistake to assume the read-only doesn't help. Your 2MB
sections penalty isnt true in a virtualised environment.
