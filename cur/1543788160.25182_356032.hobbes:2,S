Adam ... that's a glitch in the (lack of) Runtime PM support.  I tend
to agree that the kernel should enforce that, but it's an issue that
EVERY device has right now, not just SPI devices.  (And it only affects
users of /sys/devices/.../power/state files, not /sys/power/state, so
the impact is low.)
Plus as has recently been brought up on the PM list, I suspect that the
"pm core" should just ignore all notions of state and leave that up to
driver code that's actually in a position to do something sane with the
relevant sorts of hardare and/or driver state.
That is, the PM core basically can't know ANYTHING real about how the
hardware acts.  Heck, it doesn't even understand that a PCI device in
state PCI_D2 can go to PCI_D3hot without needing to be resumed first.
