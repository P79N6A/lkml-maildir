The axnet_cs driver can support the AMB8110 PC Card, so add the id for it.

In the old pcmcia-cs config file, this card is listed with the comment
"not specific enough".  The last entry in the axnet_ids has the same
comment.  They are disabled, and for good reason as it was originally
identified by the MANFID, and that is shared with several cards that use
both the pcnet_cs driver and axnet_cs driver.  I tried my AMB8110 with
pcnet_cs, and found that it works fine, and I cannot find a reason for
either, except that the old config file recommended axnet_cs.
