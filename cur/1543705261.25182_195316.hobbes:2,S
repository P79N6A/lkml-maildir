I was thinking of suggesting something similar as I browsed the thread. I would think that having Linux instead of the BIOS would be good since you would only need a small cut-down Linux that has drivers for a VGA->FB interface or something similar. The SMP approach from XGI might work in this since Linux supports SMP very well and  it could perform well with up to like 4+ GPUs? (thinking of the card size that might limit this you could have them stacked :) )
I think I'm gonna have to follow this thread closely :)
