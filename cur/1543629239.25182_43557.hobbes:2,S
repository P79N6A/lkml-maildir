  I'm having issues with a Tyan 2720 and post 2.4.18 boards with a 
Maxtor 4G120J6.  Under 2.4.18 I can turn on dma via "hdparm -d 1". 
 Under 2.4.19pre7 I get "HDIO_SET_DMA fail ed: Operation not permitted". 
 On a side note the same thing occurs with the RH 2.4.18-0.13 kernel. 
 It appears both kernels merged an ide update from the ac kernel line.
PS-There is also some issue with a resource conflict that occurs under 
every kernel I've tried.
2.4.18:
bash-2.05# hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
bash-2.05# hdparm -d /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
bash-2.05#
2.4.19pre7
root@dev30> /sbin/hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
multcount    = 16 (on)
I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
using_dma    =  0 (off)
keepsettings =  0 (off)
nowerr       =  0 (off)
readonly     =  0 (off)
readahead    =  8 (on)
geometry     = 238216/255/63, sectors = 240121728, start = 0
busstate     =  1 (on)
root@dev30> /sbin/hdparm -d1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
setting using_dma to 1 (on)
HDIO_SET_DMA fail ed: Operation not permitted
using_dma    =  0 (off)
