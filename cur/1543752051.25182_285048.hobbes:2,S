Thanks for your comments and advice, I am new to
the kernel and appreciate your taking the time.

Yes. Thanks, this confirms what I suspected.

Is this, or a short-term fix, expected anytime soon?
Problem for me is that my application no longer works
with the 2.6 kernels, since it relies on the kernel's
serial support -- which worked fine with 2.4 kernels.
If there's anything I can do to expedite a fix please
let me know -- I've spent the past few days learning
and working with the code, but I obviously have a 
ways to go before I sleep..
