Right ... there's a variant of this where the copying and clearing is
done within the actual file that defines the variable (i.e. a hook
approach).

What's the actual goal of setup_percpu.c?  To have a single location for
all the per_cpu initialisation?  If so then it's hard to get away from
all the ifdefs.  If there are alternative ways of arranging the file
then I think splitting some of the conditional pieces into other files
would work.
