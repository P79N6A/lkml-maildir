The epoll interface has to be used with non-blocking fds. The EAGAIN
return code from read/write tells you that you can go safely to wait for
events for that fd because you making the read/write to return EAGAIN, you
consumed the whole I/O space for that fd. Consuming the whole I/O space
meant that you brought the signal to zero ( talking in ee terms ), and a
followinf 0->1 transaction will trigger the event. Where 1 means I/O space
available ...
