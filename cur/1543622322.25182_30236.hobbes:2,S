Hi.
First of all, I never expected this tniny patch collection would origin
such "rivers of e-ink"...
Please, have always present that I can have made some mistake in my
offset re-engineering. But the fact that it at least survives the tests
is good.

This is really strange. I have looked at my patches and are the same. What
changed in mainlaine ??

So rc2-jam1 is running without the ide-update (I noticed your system is IDE),
but also without irqrate.
I will reorder the patches so you can apply 0*, 1* and 3* without problems,
then scsi-ide updates. And you can try with/out the ide update.
Do not see what can be related with latency in >=20*, apart from ide and
irqrate...
I do not know if you are already doing this, but I will skip the bproc part
for thins tests. It pollutes system calls with hooks for network, so it can
be hurting in many ways.
I will release a -jam2 with latest vm-27 and reordering the patches.
