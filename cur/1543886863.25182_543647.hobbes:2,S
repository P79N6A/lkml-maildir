Correcting? Well, you might correct the grammar, e.g. "This wasn't 
included until now because..." Non-native English speakers will read this 
comment and that's a good argument for good grammar, but I don't care too 
much for fixing this myself.
It is hard for me to understand other people's terse comments, which would 
make it hard for me to rewrite them in correct English. Sometimes I first 
have to figure out the idiom being used. But it is even harder to 
understand them after nuances are removed.
To answer your question, I find it easier to parse the original idiom, 
"'til now". Your corruption, "until now", loses information available to 
anyone who can recognise the idiom. Granted, this is not the worst example 
of that effect...
