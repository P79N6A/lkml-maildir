Not a popolar topic on this mailing list..
From a technical point of view what you need to do is simple.
You just need to distribute it as an external module, and provide the
dev.o file as part of this.
The dev.o file must be named 'dev.o_shipped'
Then you need a makefile like this:
obj-m := jinu.o
jinu-y := dev.o osinit.o
You can add a few more trick to enable use of plain make - see
article about external modules on the kernel page on lwn.net a few weeks ago.
What you need to compile the external module is simply:
make -C $KERNELSRC M=$PWD
Where KERNELSRC is a kernel with 'make module_prepare' executed.
