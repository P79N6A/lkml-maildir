agreed !! (I mentioned this ealier in my previous postings - sd_index_bits[]
array size)

Unfortunately, MAX_NR_DISK will be dependent on KDEV_MINOR_BITS.
We can't set MAX_NR_DISKS to arbitrary value and if there are not
enought MINOR bits, it won't work. Only way to make this work is
to do dynamic major allocation and update /dev/ entries for them.

I wish it is that simple. We use sd_index_bits[] since we could
sd_detach() and then sd_attach()  few disks. We will end up with
holes, name slippage without this. We need to know what disks are 
currently being in use.
