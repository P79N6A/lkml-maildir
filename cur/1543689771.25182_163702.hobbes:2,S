As far as I know that should be impossible, because audio-playing
runs 100% on the cd-rom hardware itself. The OS has nothing to do
with it.
So your request should go to the device manufacturers and ask
them if they could build devices, that are "multithreaded". :)
(But it maybe, that this was total crap and I better had thrown
this mail to /dev/null. I'm not 100% sure. 8-) )
