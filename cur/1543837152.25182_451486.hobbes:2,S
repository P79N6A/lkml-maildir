OK, but there will need to be comments explaining why it is OK that
this data only looks half-locked.
The locking, as it stands, looks consistent and conservative.
However, there are some places where critical sections are too big and
the locking should be narrowed.

In my current patchset, there is a per-queue lock which is mostly
managed by the block layer.
