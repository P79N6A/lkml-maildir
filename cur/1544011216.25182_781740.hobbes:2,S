OK, I see now why you wanted to remove the kref and add an atomic_t.
That's probably worth a sentence in the patch description.
I know that atomic_dec_and_lock() can be a nice logical thing to do, but
is it necessary here?  Basically, is there something that happens under
mq_lock that can re-raise the ns->count?
