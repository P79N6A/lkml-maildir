Exactly.

It's _my_ worry. I-the-user don't want my cpuinfo lying to me just
because if fits your-the-developer's codeflow better. Sheer insanity.
Getting philosophical tends to be a bad idea here but like always and
in this case; if you hide the world from people you disallow them from
improving it. It's that I _knew_ that my CPU should be supporting PAT
so that I could complain about it, but I'm your average LKML dwelling
datasheet collector.
Your feature may be very important and groovy to you, but to me it's
much more important that my cpuinfo doesn't lie to me. Please make it
not lie to me.

What on earth? Yes, it is. He added that code. The only thing that this complaint
is about is that his fix-patch added the family 6, model 7 to only _one_ instance
of that code that he himself added and not all three.

And HPA (and Molnar) then said in response to that answer:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/25/322
It's right there in response to your own link. It seems you originally missed
it, but how did you manage this time again?

Pavel was full of it?
