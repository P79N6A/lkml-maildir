Subject: ALSA misbehaving with kernel 2.4.21-pre4

I recently switched to kernel 2.4.21-pre4 from 2.4.19 (I had to
because of new hardware).  Now the timer in ALSA runs too slow.
Comparing to the system clock it drifts by about 1 second per 4
minutes, when playing sound at 48 kHz.  With lower sampling
frequencies it drifts less.  Have there been any changes in the kernel
that could explain this?  I am using alsa 0.9.0rc7 before and after
the kernel switch, I only recompiled the modules.
