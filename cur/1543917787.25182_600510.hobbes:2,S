Wouldnt go so far to say that they are unreliable, but there is certanly 
some problem between Samba and 8169 driver (and maybe other driver, 
don't remember for sure, but will check first thing in the morning)
All other protocols work perfectly, I have been able to use full 1 Gbps 
with only two concurent transfers with all of scp, rsync, http and ping 
-f -s 32000 (and any conbination of those).
