A number of questions:
(1) Can you give some examples of what tokens you might want? I've been
thinking of changing how I label token types to make new types easier to
handle (at the moment I use an enum which indexes into a number of tables, but
I'm leaning towards some sort of operations lookup table instead). I currently
have four types of token:
	* interrupt - holds interrupt number, trigger type, share mode and
		      handler routine.
	* dma	    - holds DMA channel
	* ioport    - holds I/O port range
	* memory    - holds memory address range and ioremap()'ed flag
I'm thinking of creating a fifth type specifically for PCI devices. This is
because, if I'm correct, PCI devices share a set of four IRQ pins, but these
IRQ pins are reconfigurable over (pretty much) the whole IRQ range of the
CPU. All the real interrupt tokens used by PCI devices anywhere would then be
held by the CPU->PCI bridge (PnP-BIOS) device, and PCI devices would
themselves have PCI interrupt-pin tokens attached that would reflect this:
	* PCI interrupt-pin
		    - holds ref to interrupt token and handler routine.
This would allow PCI device interrupts to be grouped together, and so
reconfigured a lot easier.
(2) Can you also clarify by what you mean by 'reserving' PCI devices?
(3) I'm I right in thinking that the MCA mark/unmark stuff is a method of
reserving devices?
