They are not all different hooks though, just many call site of the same.
Also most of them are well defined to just match what the instructions
do.
paravirt_ops has under hundred entries right now and i intend to not
expand it much further after the Xen bits are in.

The vmi maintainers already agreed to fix that.

Can you make a proposal?  Would you be willing to write code for that?

Well we have less than 100 hooks right now, just with many call sites @)

I'll believe that when I see it.

smp_send_reschedule() is just an IPI instance which is already
abstracted with genapic. Xen has a genapic_xen.
VMI is still where ->apic_read/->apic_write and their relatively
harmless timer interrupt change make sense -- if they needed
more changes they would just need to bite the bullet and 
provide a custom genapic vmware apic driver.

I am open to concrete incremental proposals for improvements.

That's VMI internal, not exposed above paravirt ops.

The code has been posted for a long time, open for review for everybody.

I don't think you can use an API to force the underlying implementation
in a practical way. If code wants to do something wrong it no API 
in the world will stop it. That is why we have code review instead.

That's because VMI is defined this way? If paravirt chosed to not pass cycles
anymore they would just add a simple conversion function. SMOP.

Well a lot of drivers have that, but it can be all fixed.

All of them.

I haven't seen a concrete example of that yet to be honest and I don't
really believe it.
