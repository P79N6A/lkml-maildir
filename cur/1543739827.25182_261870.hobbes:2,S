You generally need to keep track of this yourself, as during ->close()
the pagetables have already been destroyed. linear_page_index() can
tell you the offset into the object the vma maps, but ultimately, you
have to track the pages yourself. vma->vm_private_data can be used to
attach various accounting structures to the vma.
