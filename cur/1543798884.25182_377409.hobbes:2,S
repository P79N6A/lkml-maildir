Which I hope _did_ generate a bug report to the maintainer of that
bluetooth code.  :)

Right, but the system never stopped self-deadlocking when we did the
disconnect at suspend time.  My notes say "driver core suspend()
calls are made with dev->sem held, so usb_driver_release_interface()
always deadlocks when they try to claim the same lock" and presumably
that's still true.
I guess I didn't realize the consequence of not fixing that as part
of the other PM updates, once I found that the "most natural" fix
was (still?) not possible.

The current kernels tighten up the suspend processing and offloaded lots
of stuff to the driver core.  Previous kernels didn't have code that
could care about such stuff, at least without USB_SUSPEND enabled.
So the issue is now how to handle this error case.  I think it should
be possible to just mark the device as disconnected right as soon as
we notice it can't be suspended; resume processing will do the work,
it already does so for real disconnect.  And disconnect paths in USB
drivers are now pretty solid.
