What is the reasoning behind this? What are the benefits of just
having a global goal colour counter? As long as two processes, each
allocating a page, receive a different colour for their pages, then
they should be able to inhabit the cache at the same time.
Why take it further and the same virtual address should give different
colour pages?

Again, why? Isn't it good enough that a contiguous chunk of virtual
address space maps to unique cache lines?

Can I assume from this scheme that, when reading blocks from disc, the
pid of the initiating process is used for the hash? Or is this
algorithm only used for anonymous pages?

Agreed. It's very hard to work out why your programme isn't performing
as expected when the OS doesn't provide a stable foundation.

I assume you mean those programmes which are slowed down by page
colouring have a silly access pattern which results in cache line
aliasing? They only ran faster without page colouring because random
physical page allocations actually gave them a chance of avoiding this
aliasing?
