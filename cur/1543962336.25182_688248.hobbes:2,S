The usual problem is that they don't use that on older systems
but a different HAL (or XP doesn't run at all on these older systems).
But Linux still wants to run on older systems, ideally without
special settings too.
So if it's done like this it likely needs some date or other heuristic to 
decide if it should trust ACPI or should not.
