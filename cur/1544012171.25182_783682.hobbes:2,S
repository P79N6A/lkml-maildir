A literally that simple macro, or a complicated one?
I'm all for using brackets when there is / could be some possibility
of increasing code readability.
E.g. I always use parentheses in a nested if-if, because
	if (x)
		if (y)
			a;
		else
			c;
may be confusing, especially if formatted differently.
	if (x)
		a;
	else if (y)
		b;
	etc.
is simple and unambiguous and I don't put the braces.
So is a case like
	do
		x;
	while (y);
It can't be made more clear with brackets.
IOW: improving the style is great. Changing it only to silence some
tool is not.

Right, but they (at least for me) make it more readable.
kmalloc(sizeof i) just doesn't look good, the operator looks like
a variable name.
But there is this return statement. Some people tend to write
return (x); I simply write return x;
It's clear, and so is a simple do-while.

:-)
BTW I think I may use sparse differently.
I can see false gcc warnings every time the project is being built.
OTOH I run sparse only when I have some (almost) completed project
(a patch, a driver etc). I make sure the remaining sparse warnings are
(from my POV) invalid and it won't spew them on next build again.
