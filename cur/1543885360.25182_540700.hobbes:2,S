Yes - there are too many applications which require tight/sync connection with 
the data - control loops, software radios, machine control, etc - all have 
much different needs than audio, hwmon, or touchscreen.

I am assuming that the driver takes care of all DMA/coherency issues that 
might pop up? (and handles all interrupts)?

I would guess that something like v4l might be the best bet - the driver 
provides a few mmapped buffers that you can read/write into, and some 
mechanism to sync in/out of the buffers.
I was actually looking at UIO, but thought that since we really desire the 
kernel ring buffers, that a think model might be better.?
