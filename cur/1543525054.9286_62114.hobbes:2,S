Please Lawrence drop the two preliminary versions I sent you by email
privately, these new one are better (and also compiles :>). I spent some
more time doing better tuning too.
I am interested if you could do a new bench of the rewrite case, I did
something exactly to try to address the little drop of performance in the
rewrite case.
Now I'll start to improve starve_rest_of_queue in 2.3.x where I can have a
per-queue generation count. The algorithm will be plain the same, only
implementation will get improved.
