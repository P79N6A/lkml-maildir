That was just a stop gap way to do the migration before you have
xattrs for shared libraries. If you have them it's not needed.

It can be done, but it's ugly. But it really was only intended for
the shared libraries.

That would be only in this scenario; I agree it doesn't make sense
to add it as a general restriction to the syscall.

An mmaped object exists on its own. It's access is fully reference counted etc.

It doesn't seem very realistic to me. When a user wants to change
its own address room then they can use mbind() from the beginning
and they should know how their memory layout is.
