My laptop has got both a pointing stick int he middle of the keyboard
and a glide pad in front of the keyboard. During all of the recent
(and quite possibly even before that) both devices worked happily
under X (RH 7.x and 8.0). After I decided to test out 2.5.42-ac1, only
the glide pad works and the pointing stick is dead.
Here's the relevant bit from my bootlog:
register interface 'mouse' with class 'input
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev 1.1.
serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12

input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0

After DRM is initialized in the log, i get this:

And that is without touchign the keys untill the GDM screen asks for a
username.
.config is attached as well.
Any pointer on what more I can provide, or someting I missed?
