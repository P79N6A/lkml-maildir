While the next bisect proved that these patches are innocent, I'm
still blaming you for my problems. ;)
The problem with the first bisect-try was, that everything between
bisect-good: r-o-bind-mounts-elevate-write-count-over-calls-to-vfs_rename
and
bisect-bad: use-struct-path-in-struct-svc_export
did not compile like this:
  CC [M]  fs/nfsd/vfs.o
fs/nfsd/vfs.c: In function 'nfsd_rename':
fs/nfsd/vfs.c:1695: error: request for member 'mnt' in something not a
structure or union
make[2]: *** [fs/nfsd/vfs.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/nfsd] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
This is cause by: nfsd-fix-wrong-mnt_writer-count-in-rename
With this patch reverted I was able to finish the bisect:
Good: move-struct-path-into-its-own-header
...: embed-a-struct-path-into-struct-nameidata-instead-of-nd-dentrymnt
Bad: embed-a-struct-path-into-struct-nameidata-instead-of-nd-dentrymnt-checkpatch-fixes
As you also wrote
embed-a-struct-path-into-struct-nameidata-instead-of-nd-dentrymnt , I
would like to ask you to take another look at it.
The only thing that looks suspicious to me in that patch is the
following change in nfs4_atomic_open(), nfs4_open_revalidate() and
nfs4_proc_create()
-	struct path path = {
-		.mnt = nd->mnt,
-		.dentry = dentry,
-	};
+	struct path path = nd->path;
This changes the path.dentry from the explizit parameter 'dentry' to
the embedded dentry from the parameter 'nd'.
Hope this helps.
Torsten
