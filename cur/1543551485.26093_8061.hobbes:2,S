I have not tried this on an alpha before, and I wouldn't be surprised
that its broken.  Someone attempted to get agpgart going on the alpha
awhile ago, but I don't think they ever followed through.  I think I
might be able to get access to an alpha w/ the Irongate, I'll see what I
can do.  I do know there will be a few issues (64-bit issues, cache
flushing issues, etc.), so I can't promise that it will be fast.  Btw,
does the Alpha have something resembling i386 UCWC'ed memory?  If so
could someone point me at some docs?

I believe this is fixed in the latest 2.4.0-test.  However I believe
that the only driver that has been tested on the alpha is the 3Dfx
driver.  The other drivers are bound to have a few 64-bit issues.
