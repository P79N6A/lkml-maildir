Transparent paravirtualization patches, set 4.  This batch includes
mostly MMU hooks that can be used by the hypervisor for page allocation,
and allows the kernel to be compiled to step out of the way of the
hypervisor by making a hole in linear address space.
Patches are based off 2.6.13-rc6-mm2; I've tested i386 PAE and non-PAE
as well as um-i386.  Although these are mostly i386 specific, some of
the concepts are starting to apply to virtualization of other
architectures as well.
