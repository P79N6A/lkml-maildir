Many? I can't recall anything besides PF_MEMALLOC and the decision
that the VM is oom. Those are the only two gray areas... the safety
margin is large enough that nobody notices the lack of black-and-white
solution.
So instead of working to provide guarantees for the above two gray
spots, we're making everything weaker, that's the wrong direction as
far as I can tell, especially if we're going to mess up big time the
commo code in a backwards way only for those few users of those few
I/O devices out there.
In general every time reliability has a low priority than performance
I've an hard time to enjoy it.
