After some further consideration, I don't think that my patches would
be at all changed by adjusting HZ's default value. I just want to make
sure maintainers are still responsive to appropriate patches to split
time-based delays from tick-based delays. So, CONFIG_HZ is ok by me,
but I consider it a band-aid.
