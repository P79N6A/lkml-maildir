Well, you actually exploited bug in ACPI /proc handling. Cute.

It works as designed. Perhaps on one sunny day shutdown will support
-z option meaning "do swsusp".

Q: My machine doesn't work with ACPI. How can I use swsusp than ?
A: Do reboot() syscall with right parameters. Warning: glibc gets in
its way, so check with strace:
reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1, LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2, 0xd000fce2)
(Thanks to Peter Osterlund:)
#include <unistd.h>
#include <syscall.h>
#define LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1     0xfee1dead
#define LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2     672274793
#define LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_SW_SUSPEND     0xD000FCE2
int main()
{
    syscall(SYS_reboot, LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1, LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2,
            LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_SW_SUSPEND, 0);
    return 0;
}
