Being able to at least turn it on at run time is valuable when you are debugging
a box operated by someone who doesnt habitually rebuild kernels. The 750 of 1000
thing doesnt work because it can happen to be timing triggered by blocks of IRQ's
from a chip being folded together. The "million in a row" should be a stuck IRQ,
maybe 50,000 in a row even but just "zillions in a row"
