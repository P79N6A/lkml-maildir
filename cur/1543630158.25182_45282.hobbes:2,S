It doesn't help. When compiling, KBUILD_BASENAME is the name of the main
source file, i.e. the one given on the command line (basically the same
thing as __BASEFILE__ or whatever that gcc preprocessor variable is
called).
You don't want to get "BUG at foo:23", when the BUG instruction is
actually at filesystem.h:23. Only the compiler knows which source file it
is currently dealing with.
