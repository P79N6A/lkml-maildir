Unfortunately such info is hard to find. The discuss@x86-64 list is
empty. So, let me ask how this memcpy relates to recently submitted
for glibc one [0]?

Also you are enabling rep. string operations for 10h family. Yet manual
says, that while they were improved, there are still various other
preferred optimization cases
Thanks.
