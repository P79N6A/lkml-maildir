James,
in a change over three years ago, you added implicit aligning to
__get_vm_area() for VM_IOREMAP requests. I wonder, though,
whether it was intentional to over-align requests of sizes that are
an exact power of two (and between PAGE_SIZE and
(1 << IOREMAP_MAX_ORDER)). I would think that the argument of
fls() should be (size - 1) rather than size.
Thanks, Jan
