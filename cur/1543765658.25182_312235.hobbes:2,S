Yeah.. but it shouldn't matter much since I've not been able to load the initrd

I thought the second one would so I changed the code (took a while to find 
the right place since I use 2.6 not 2.4) However that's a fix for a problem 
I don't have. My kernel never complains about root= bla it only says unable 
to mount on root fs.
I'm not sure what this tells us.

I hope so. I have it setup up like in the loop-aes readme. Is there something special 
you have in mind?

Nope. I only have a knoppix and kanotix rescue disc to work off at the time 
=)

No, I would if I knew how. Is there any howto for that?
Cheers.
