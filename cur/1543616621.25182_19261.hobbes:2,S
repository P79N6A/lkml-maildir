Tried. I haven't been able to freeze box after some not very long torturing 
with artsd, but there is another new trouble:
For test I'm letting artsd to play some WAV file and after that give some 
time for it to close /dev/dsp. After some times there is no more sound and 
I'm getting a message that /dev/dsp is busy when trying to restart artsd. 
Anyway I can reload i810_audio driver and restart artsd to get sound working 
again. 'fuser /dev/dsp' also doesn't show that it is opened
