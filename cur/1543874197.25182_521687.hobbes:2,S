Can you please provide your .config and a bootlog from a boot with
"nolapic" and without. Also please add apic=verbose to the commandline.
Can you please use Linus' latest git snaphost
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.21-rc4-git4.bz2
or pull from Linus' git repository.
You can please open a new bug (Category: Timers, Component: Other) on
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 and upload the files there, so we avoid
distributing them via LKML.
Thanks,
	tglx
