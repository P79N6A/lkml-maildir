Subject: [PATCH] Use correct x86 reboot vector
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/9/274

Extensive discussion by various experts on the discuss@x86-64.org
mailing list concluded that the correct vector to restart an 286+ 
CPU is f000:fff0, not ffff:0000. Both seem to work on current systems, 
but the first is correct.
See the "DPMI on AMD64" and "Warm reboot for x86-64 linux" threads
on 
http://www.x86-64.org/mailing_lists/list?listname=discuss&listnum=0
 
for more details.
This patch fixes the 2.5.69 i386 reboot code to use this too.
