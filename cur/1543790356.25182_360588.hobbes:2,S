you could also try to get messages on the screen by preventing from blanking
using setterm :
    # setterm -blank 0
Also, using a serial console to get and log messages can help.

I also saw that at least the machine shown in the report is using grsec. Are
all machines using grsec ? Although I don't believe it would be the cause,
we cannot exclude that a recent bug could have been introduced in it.
And what's the average time before a crash ? hours, days, weeks ?
