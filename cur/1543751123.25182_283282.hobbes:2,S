It was already fixed in the recent ALSA tree.
So, just syncing bk-alsa patch would suffice.

The default blocking behavior of OSS devices was changed recently.
When the device is in use, open returns -EBUSY immediately in the
latest version while it was blocked until released in the former
version.

It's hard to tell.  The cause could be in the general interrupt
handling, the difference of HZ, the driver's interrupt setting, or
whatever.  This must depend on the hardware, anyway.
