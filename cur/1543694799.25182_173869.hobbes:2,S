You could make a solid state device really cheaply yourself - all you
need is a simple circuit that will allow you to connect 512 Mb of
EPROMs to the parallel port, and write a device driver to make them
appear as a block device.  If you wan to boot from it, just find any
old network card with a boot PROM socket, write a bootloader which
could read a kernel image from the parallel port connected device,
write that bootloader to a PROM, and put it on the network card.
John.
