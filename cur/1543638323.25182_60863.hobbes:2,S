It also means we can't automatically switch to large pages for
SHM segments, which is the number one area where we need large
pages...
We should also take into account that the main application that
needs large pages for its SHM segments is Oracle, which we don't
have the source code for so we can't recompile it to use the new
syscalls introduced by this patch ...
IMHO we shouldn't blindly decide for (or against!) this patch
but also carefully look at the large page patch from RHAS (which
got added to -aa recently) and the large page patch which IBM
is working on.
kind regards,
Rik
