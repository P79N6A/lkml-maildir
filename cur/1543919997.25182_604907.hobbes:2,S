Thanks for the explanation, you're obviously correct.
However, I don't think the mapping_cap_writeback_dirty() check in
__filemap_fdatawrite_range() works as expected when tmpfs is a lower
mount for an unionfs mount. There's no BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK capability
for unionfs mappings so do_fsync() will call write_cache_pages() that
unconditionally invokes shmem_writepage() via unionfs_writepage().
Unless, of course, there's some other unionfs magic I am missing.
