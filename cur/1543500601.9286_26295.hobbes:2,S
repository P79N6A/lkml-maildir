I'm glad to hear Richard and others re-iterate the NeXT
approach. I worked with NeXTstep for nearly 10 years
(yep, I didn't switch my home system to linux/X11 until
Jan this year) because it is far and away the best
and most consistant computer/GUI I have ever worked with.
I'd love to see the like under Linux as well. In USER
land. There is very little that has any place in the
kernel. One exception is an item on another thread:
a signal that tells you when a file is written. That
is very useful, perhaps essential, for NeXTstep type
GUI's.
I've had some involvement with the Black Linux project,
less time put in than I wish, but I have a long term
interest in actually making the old NeXT.App's run
under Linux, at least on my trusty old NeXTstation.
Which brings up another issue. How difficult would
it be to spoof such apps? I presume if WINE can
be made, Mach/NeXT couldn't possibly be as difficult.
