Hey, we give you the power. Actually realizing it all and getting used to 
it may take some time. In the meantime, you can use the pre-canned helper 
functions and just cut-and-paste from emails ;)
One of the 133 git commands is actually "git request-pull" that does this 
all for you. I always forget it, because I don't use it myself, and quite 
frankly, it's just a shell-script helper to do this all for you. But if 
you're into that kind of thing, you can actually read that shell-script 
(and others) and learn more that way ;)
