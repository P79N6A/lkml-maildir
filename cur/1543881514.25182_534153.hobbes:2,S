Subject: Re: [Devel] [PATCH -mm] utrace: fix double free re	__rcu_process_callbacks()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Roland,
can you please help with it?
current utrace state is far from being stable,
RHEL5 and -mm kernels can be quite easily crashed with some of the exploits
we collected so far.
Alexey can help you with any information needed - call traces, test cases,
but without your help we can't fix it all ourselfes :/
Thanks,
Kirill
