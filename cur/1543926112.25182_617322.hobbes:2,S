Great, thanks for testing.  I'll apply Herbert's patch tomorrow

Yes, I wonder why too.  I bet objects just got packed differently.
There is this fugly "LOOPBACK_OVERHEAD" macro define in
drivers/net/loopback.c that is trying to figure out the
various overheads that we should subtract from the loopback
MTU we use by default.
It's almost guarenteed to be wrong for the way the allocators
work now.
