OK, so a "hard link" isn't (because it has separate permissions than the
original). Sorry, watered-down symlinks don't cut it. Or just by linking
the file into my place I now have rights to modify it? The later idea makes
my skin try to crawl away...

You are completely right: This is an extremely central concept to
everything Unix.

Which is a very clear explanation of how broken it all is. No wonder
NetWare is no more. Files whose persmissions change depending on which way
you look at them is a nightmare. Sure, you /can/ manage that for small(ish)
setups by brute force, but it soon has to break down.
