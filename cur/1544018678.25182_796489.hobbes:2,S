Client/server model and distributed systems are popular. To be flexible,
these applications mostly can be configured in one machine, or in a group of
machines. If in one machine, they are used to communicate with network loopback.
I once touched a big distributed telecom application which use UDP to communicate
between front-end and back-end. If they merge ﻿front-end and back-end to one machine
based on some customers' requirements to reduce cost, that will be an example.
