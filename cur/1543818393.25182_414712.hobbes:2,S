NACK.
With this change when window width is > 80 then we waste half of
the screen width only to right-indent the menus.
We truncate longer prompts and with this we require twice the
width to see full prompt.
One could argue that the old ITEM_IDENT should be 0 instead of 1,
avoiding wasting an extra char. But with this change we waste
a lot of space.
