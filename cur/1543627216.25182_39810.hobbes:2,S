Hi
Thank you for the replies.

I believe it's probably OK.  We considered as follows.
Please consider a knfsd sends data of File A by useing sendmsg().
  1. The knfsd copies the data of File A into sk_buff.
  2. File A may be truncated after step.1
  3. NFS clients receives the packets of File A which is already truncated.
Next please consider the knfsd sends data of File A by useing sendpage().
  1. The knfsd grabs pages of File A. (page_cache_get)
  2. File A may be truncated after step.1
  3. The knfsd send the pages.
  4. NFS clients receives the packets of File A which is already truncated.
Is there any differences between them ?
This behavior is invisible to NFS Clients, I think.

I think NFSD is a part of kernel -- not a usermode process, so NFSD can
control to avoid this kind of situations.
New zerocopy knfsd grabs pages of file and its atrribute in a same operation.
I think no discrepancy between them would occur.
And yes I know sending pages might be overwritten by another process,
but it maybe also happens on local filesystems. File data can be
updated while another process is reading the same file.

I'm happy to talk to you.
Thank you,
