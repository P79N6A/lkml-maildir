I don't think that's really the distinction that matters.  I think
really the issue is that assignment within an if is hard to read, so
	ret = foo(a, b);
        if (ret) { ... }
is clearly preferred to
	if ((ret = foo(a,b))) { ... }
However, in my opinion something like
	if (foo(a,b)) { ... }
if perfectly fine if the return value of foo is not needed anywhere
else.  In other words, there's no sense introducing a temporary
variable to hold the return value if you're never going to do anything
with it other than check it on the next line.
