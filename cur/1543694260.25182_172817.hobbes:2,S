I've got a 2.4.21 system running SMP, PIII Xeon, booting off AIC7890,
using AIC7880, and another 2940 (I think) along with a pair of 120gb
drives on the IDE controllers.  It's working quite nicely, and I'm
planning on moving to 2.4.22 soon as well.
My system has the Intel GX chipset, what does yours have?  I've also
turned off ACPI in the bios, but I do have:
  CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
  CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
  CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
in my config.  Maybe it's a chipset issue you're seeing?
