Subject: Calculation of private memory of processes for estimation of RAM  in big  server

I would like to know how to calculate the amount of private memory (i.e.
memory used only by that process) so I can estimate the total amount of
RAM I have to put in a heavy loaded server.
In Sun Solaris I use a tool called pmap that gives me a resume of the
private and shared memory and the size image of each process. This pmap
utility uses the /proc filesystem to obtain the information.
In Linux I've used ps axl and I think that the RSS column is the right
one, but I'm not sure. Also I've look at the file
/proc/<PID_OF_PROCESS>/status that has, for example,  these lines:
VmSize:     1144 kB
VmLck:         0 kB
VmRSS:        52 kB
VmData:       28 kB
VmStk:         8 kB
VmExe:        56 kB
VmLib:      1024 kB
But again I'm not sure which one of these numbers is the one to look at.
Could please
any VM guru help with this?
