This should be the page fault/journal lock inversion stuff Nick was
working on.  His patchset had a pretty good description of the problems,
Badari can also dig through the novell/ltc bugzillas for vmmstress.
Should be LTC9358.
Hopefully Nick's patches will address all of this.  sles9 had a partial
solution for the mmap deadlock, I think it was to dirty the inode at a
later time.  For some reason, I thought this workload was passing in
later kernels...
