Preemption of a guest holding a busywait-protected resource is
catastrophic, yes. Voluntarily yielding to the host is one of the
few tactics a guest can use, alongside more widespread use of blocking
locking primitives and using host-provided locking primitives.
Gang scheduling in the host is stronger medicine for this, and has the
further advantage that it does not confuse contention with host
preemption. It may be valuable for Linux likewise to implement gang
scheduling to accommodate its own usage as a host, as futexes are only
usable when the guest issues system calls natively (as is the case in
UML; guests in full CPU emulators may not even be executing native
instructions).
I suspect that the optimal configuration would use 2-tier locking in
addition to gang scheduling the guests, where the outer tier busywaits
for some interval before backing off to an inner tier using a host-
provided locking primitive (obviously the host should not suspend the
entire gang when a guest blocks on the host-provided locking primitive).
It's unclear whether some attempt should be made to avoid the host-
provided wakeup portion of the locking primitives. The 2-tier locking
algorithms are still beneficial in the absence of gang scheduling, as
spurious host context switches likely carry a high cost; the backoff
should be arranged so that busywait is only done as long as the
expected cost of a spurious host context switch remains greater than
the expected cost of busywaiting during a host preemption, where in
the presence of gang scheduling the latter cost is merely lock contention
(i.e. gang scheduling allows guests to busywait as long as they expect
the latency of lock acquisition to be smaller than a host context switch,
where the longer one has busywaited the longer one expectes to busywait).
I suppose the first step is to get a hook for the host primitives into
the locking algorithms, so I approve of all this etc.
