In theory yes, on occasion I do get bugs that break XFree86 4.3, but
these are bugs as opposed to design decisions, upgrading the kernel
should never require upgrading to a new  version of X or anything like
that, however upgrading X can sometimes require a newer kernel in
order to take advantage of newer drm features.. but X should always
work with the older drms...
