Thats one I've been chasing and is caused by this same patch.  We've 
lost the separation between command_line and saved_command_line and the 
user visible line gets trunc'd.  Andi has a later version which has this 
part fixed as far as I can tell.  I'm posting a dirty patch in response 
to my report of this to at least get past this bit as our test system 
relies on the commmand line being maintained to user space.
