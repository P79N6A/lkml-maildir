Hmmmm...
I see your problem.  I think the right way to deal with this is to get rid of
mb(), rmb(), wmb() and read_barrier_depends() and replace them with io_mb(),
io_rmb(), ...
I think that there are only two places you should be using explicit memory
barriers:
 (1) To control inter-CPU effects on an SMP system.
 (2) To control CPU vs device effects.

Yes, but I suppose which "other components" may depend on the class of barrier
used.

As it stands, mb() is a superset of smp_mb(), and rmb() of smp_rmb(), etc.,
so, yes, currently, mb() implies smp_mb().  However, mb() shouldn't be used if
smb_mb() is sufficient as that may impact performance on a UP system.
Really, mb() should only be used with respect to I/O.

If the shared memory is purely an inter-CPU effect, yes.  If the shared memory
is actually a device with side effects, then I/O safe memory barriers are
required - mb() and co.  Note that there must _also_ be safety wrt to other
CPUs in the system, as other CPUs may also try to access the device.

You may use locking instead to control inter-CPU effects.  Locks imply one-way
permeable SMP-class memory barriers.

I think the best way to do an audit would be to make mb() and co. deprecated,
pending obsolete, and to replace them with io_mb() and co.  That way people
would have to eyeball any usages of mb() and co.

If it's _purely_ to control inter-CPU SMP sharing, then yes, it's broken.  It
must use either a lock or an smp_*mb() barrier.
Of course, Linus may disagree...
