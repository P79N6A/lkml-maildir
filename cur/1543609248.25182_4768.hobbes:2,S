XFree86 4.1.0 doesn't work. Neither did rawhide 4.1.0 ~two months ago.
Result was usually blank screen without signal and deadlock. Some versions
did work when agpgart and DRI was disabled. Only CVS version worked with
agpgart and DRI. Latest radeon DRI kernel module has been working for few
months.
Haven't been testing RedHat's versions of XFree86 since switching to CVS
version.
