Please assume that in the near future we will be scheduling SPU contexts
in and out multiple times a second. Even in a single application, you
can easily have more contexts than you have physical SPUs.
The event buffer by definition needs to be per context. If you for some
reason want to collect the samples per physical SPU during an event
interrupt, you should at least make sure that they are copied into the
per-context event buffer on a context switch.
At the context switch point, you probably also want to drain the
hw event counters, so that you account all events correctly.
We also want to be able to profile the context switch code itself, which
means that we also need one event buffer associated with the kernel to
collect events that for a zero context_id.
Of course, the recording of raw samples in the per-context buffer does
not need to have the dcookies along with it, you can still resolve
the pointers when the SPU context gets destroyed (or an object gets
unmapped).
