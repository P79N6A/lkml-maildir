I've had similar problems w/ my setup here.  (Tyan S1668D MB, w/
Mylex BT-958 controllers going to Seagate drives.)  I've
managed to mitigate the problem by lowering down the controllers
to 10MB/sec from the optimum of 40MB/sec.
This has been an issue ever since switching to 2.2.* series
but it appears to be insiduous.  I've swapped out every component
on the system (MB, cpus, cards, drives, et al) and it still happends
but on a similar system (same MB, et al) it doesn't have a problem.
Cables are the same (all granite digital, so I know that they're fine).
If you happen to find anything I'd be interested as well.
Steve
