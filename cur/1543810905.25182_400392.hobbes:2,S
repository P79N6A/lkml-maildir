Ignore my previous mail.
How about doing this ? Change b_state to u32 and change b_size
to "size_t". This way, we don't increase the overall size of
the structure on 64-bit machines. Isn't it ?
Thanks,

struct buffer_head {
        u32 b_state;                    /* buffer state bitmap (see
above) */
        atomic_t b_count;               /* users using this buffer_head
*/
        struct buffer_head *b_this_page;/* circular list of page's
buffers */
        struct page *b_page;            /* the page this bh is mapped to
*/
        size_t b_size;                  /* size of mapping */
        sector_t b_blocknr;             /* start block number */
        char *b_data;                   /* pointer to data within the
page */
        struct block_device *b_bdev;
        bh_end_io_t *b_end_io;          /* I/O completion */
        void *b_private;                /* reserved for b_end_io */
        struct list_head b_assoc_buffers; /* associated with another
mapping */
};
Thanks,
