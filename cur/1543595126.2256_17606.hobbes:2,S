    Why can't we increase this number by default ?
It might break stuff, like things that link with code that assumes it
is only 1024.
    Shouldn't it be set to the real limit of the kernel ?
Nah... the kernel limit is 1024^2 --- you don't want to use select
anywhere near that.
    (And let applications define their own limit if there is a need
    for one ?)
Well, squid and friends do this anyhow.
Not only that, using a greatly increased value should be a run-time
decision, lest you want your code to break on early 2.2.x kernels and
before.
