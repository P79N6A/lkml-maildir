Huh?  A laptop on the table is subjected to 1G on earth. If turned over,
is still subjected to 1G, although the sensor may show -1G. Unless
the correct k (calibration factor) is known, for each load direction,
it cannot be derived from +/- 1, the only readings you have, because
of the 1G bias of the load-cell itself.
A pair of load-cells mounted orthagonally, will show the accelleration
in 4 axis. However, you can't assume that if you held the mass at
a 45 degree angle, for instance, that both sensors would read
0.707 (cos 45) or that if at 90, one pair would read 0.0
You need to calibrate using real values. With a sping-scale, and
some room to swing the device, you can readily obtain some accurate
load values.
