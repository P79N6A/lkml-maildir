The concern that I had was that people would actually start using the 
stupid thing, and start to rely on the path and existence of them. But, I 
suppose if people really _want_ to do that, we shouldn't stop them from 
hurting themselves. ;)
Userspace does need to know major/minor, as well as block vs. char. We 
could encode those in one file each, but a device node gives us all three 
in a standard format. 
So, appended is a patch that allows you to create a device node in 
driverfs. The API is:
int device_create_node(struct device *device, mode_t mode, kdev_t kdev);
The name is "node", and it's created in the device's directory. There are 
plans to call /sbin/hotplug after the device is registered with its class. 
It's then that the kernel will know what type of device it is, and what 
the major/minor should be. The device path will be passed to 
/sbin/hotplug, which can then query the node as a template for creating 
other device nodes. 
Note that ->fops is not set, though it appears that a request_module()  
happpens when you try to write to it.
Also, the owner of the device is root, and I easily make the permissions 
more stringent (i.e. make it S_IRUGO only always).
Attached is a simple little module to illustrate the use of the API. It 
creates a device 'foo0' and a node inside its directory once registered:
# tree /sys/root/foo0/
/sys/root/foo0/
|-- name
|-- node
`-- power
# ls -l /sys/root/foo0/node 
cr--r--r--    1 root     root      10,  16 Sep 23 10:58 
/sys/root/foo0/node
Will submit as a BK patch pending feedback..
