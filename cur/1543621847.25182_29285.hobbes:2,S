Ok.  For the adventurous types, you'll at the very least need to apply the
below included patches to get Sparc64 to begin the compilation process at
all.   Here is some details:
/include/asm-sparc64/mmu_context.h - movement of the #define for MAX_PRIO_RT
in the scheduler causes the compile to fail here.  My patch below will
comment out at least the failing Function, which does not appear to be doing
anything usefull anyways.
/kernel/sched.c - Ingo changed the scheduler switch_to() to 2 arguments
rather than three, but the appropriate assembly changes have not been
applied to /asm-sparc64/system.h.  Ingo pointed me  to a work around for
this for now, by changing the swicht_to() back to three args for sched.c.
This is not the correct fix, but will get the compile to continue.
From here, I am getting the following errors compiling filemap.c.  Anyone at
all have any luck getting Sparc to compile with 2.5.5?  
 `flush_dcache_page' doesn't match global one
/usr/src/linux-2.5.5/include/linux/highmem.h: In function
`truncate_list_pages':

Thanks,

Here are the patch diffs to get Sparc to compile at all....
