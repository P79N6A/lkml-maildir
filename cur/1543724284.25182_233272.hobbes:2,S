I suspect not.  Up to Linus.  This is all about writing code that
doesn't bite.
Since mostly it's us humans doing the writing, this is more a human
engineering problem than a pure mathematics problem such as Dijkstra
or Wirth were closer to addressing.
Let someone with demonstrated good taste dictate the style choices
that lead to short, sweat, but seldom screwy code.
It's all arbitrary as hell.  The proof is in the pudding.
