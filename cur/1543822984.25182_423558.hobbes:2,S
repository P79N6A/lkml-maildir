What just now comes into my mind is: Do you really want to execute a
program (be it a script or a binary) which you aren't allowed to read
before?

Yes, is probably the best "solution" if someone creates such a patch.

I'm also a "root knows per definition what s/he is doing" person but
more the problem is that root must give sensitive permsisions to scripts
written by God-knows-who. So either
-) root trusts completely some project/persons/... to quote everything
   prefectly and rules injections completely out or
-) root has to check all the SUID scripts (including some of the stuff
   called from there).
Yes, we have more than enough bugs in compiled programs but it is far
more easy to get buggy scripts together.
