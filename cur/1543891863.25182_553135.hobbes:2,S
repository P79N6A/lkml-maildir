rcu_read_lock disables preemption in mainline (see rcupdate.h).
Conversion to RCU is also complicated by conditional policy support
(changing of policy boolean states via selinuxfs).  However, there were
experimental patches to do that a while ago by KaiGai Kohei.
I think that there are several factors here:
- targeted policy yields an explosion in the possible transitions at
login time since users are effectively unconfined there.  There would be
far fewer computations under strict policy.
- sel_write_user -> security_get_user_sids does a lot of work while
holding the policy rdlock, including all of those compute_av calls
inside of its own loops.  This is the function that is computing
reachable contexts for the user (role set) based on policy from the
initial login context at login time.  I think this function can be
refactored to drop and retake locks appropriately and to introduce
cond_resched calls.
- compute_av has potentially long loops internally if the policy makes
significant use of attributes; this was the tradeoff in memory vs.
performance introduced by the patches to reduce the avtab memory use
introduced in 2.6.14.  In the common case, you don't see it due to the
AVC caching the results of compute_av but security_get_user_sids doesn't
go through the AVC.  That's harder to fix.
I think we can try refactoring security_get_user_sids and see how much
that helps.
