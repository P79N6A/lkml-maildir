Actually, sometimes we can (and do) schedule multiple devices
for overlapped I/O on the same controller.  ATAPI devices (cdrom, tape,
zip/floppy) can overlap some operations with a hard disk (or other ATAPI)
on the same cable/controller.
And I think Gadi added per-device (rather than per-controller) queues
somewhere in the 2.1.xx timeframe, to improve performance of disk<->tape
backups on a single controller.
ATA4/ATA5 now include "queued commands" for even more overlap,
pretty much identical to SCSI.  But Linux does not (yet) support that.
Cheers
