gcc _will_ add padding in many cases.

If structure members are laid out the right way, no padding is added. As

TCP was designed for natural alignment of the fields, for efficiency. This
is _not_ to be taken for granted for any random struct.
Besides, the aliasing rules of C allow the compiler to assume your
