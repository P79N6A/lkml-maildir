Nearly: A sparse file with the only page at 4G is the worst case: You
need three extra pages to hold the swap entry. The ratio goes fown as
soon as you add more pages somewhere.

Ok, 64GB shm allocate roughly 64MB swap entries, so this case should
not bother too much. I was still at the 390x case where we have 512
entries per page. But they do not need highmem.
Another case are smaller machines with big tmpfs instances: They get
killed by the swap entries. But you cannot hinder that without
swapping the swap entries themselves.
