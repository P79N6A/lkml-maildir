Agreed, but the point of my post (and 6to4 in general) is that -- like 
the general theme of IPv6 itself -- using 6to4 under Fedora Core 2 works 
automatically.  No need to worry about logging into a tunnel broker, and 
no need to worry about traffic with other 6to4 sites being sub-optimally 
routed.
