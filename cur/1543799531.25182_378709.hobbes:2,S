Subject: [patch 0/8] mutex subsystem, -V6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

this is verion -V6 of the generic mutex subsystem. It consists of the 
following patches:
  add-atomic-xchg.patch
  mutex-generic-asm-implementations.patch
  mutex-arch-mutex-h.patch
  mutex-core.patch
  mutex-docs.patch
  mutex-debug.patch
  mutex-debug-more.patch
  xfs-mutex-namespace-collision-fix.patch
the patches are against Linus' latest GIT tree, and they should work 
fine on every Linux architecture.

this release picks up Arjan's asm/mutex.h implementation, which adds 
asm-generic/mutex-dec.h, asm-generic/mutex-xchg.h for architectures to 
pick up. i386 and x86_64 use their own optimized version already, the 
other architectures default to mutex-xchg.h. Architectures specify the 
following functions:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  __mutex_fastpath_lock - try to take the lock by moving the count
 *                          from 1 to a 0 value
 *  @count: pointer of type atomic_t
 *  @fn: function to call if the original value was not 1
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  __mutex_fastpath_lock_retval - try to take the lock by moving the count
 *                                 from 1 to a 0 value
 *  @count: pointer of type atomic_t
 *  @fn: function to call if the original value was not 1
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  __mutex_fastpath_unlock - try to promote the mutex from 0 to 1
 *  @count: pointer of type atomic_t
 *  @fn: function to call if the original value was not 1
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
and __mutex_slowpath_needs_to_unlock(), to specify whether the fastpath 
has touched the count or not.
i have tested this on x86, and i have booted all 4 variants: 
mutex-xchg.h, mutex-dec.h, asm-i386/mutex.h and the debug version. (in 
MUTEX_DEBUG_FULL mode, i.e. with the mutexes in real use.)
Nico, Christoph, does this approach work for you? Nico, you might want 
to try an ARM-specific mutex.h implementation.
