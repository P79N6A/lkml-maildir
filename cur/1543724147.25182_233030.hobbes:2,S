The point is, there really isn't anything fancy about this
"auto tuning". It just alters the reclaim_mapped formula.
If we decide that the new formula gives better results, then
we should go with that. Exposing an intermediate calculation
in the swappiness sysctl is meaningless.
You can then work out somewhere to input a manual "swappiness"
bias into the new calculation.
