As for the old machines - heh. How about 1099? PDP-10, that is...
SMP on those might be serious PITA, though - it did 4-way, but cache
architecture sucked horribly. Might be not completely impractical - XKL-10
boxen were produced pretty recently (heck knows what happens now).
36-bit port of UNIX would be quite a fun...
