I took some time to develop a little test/benchmark program
for csum and csum_copy routines (used in networking).
It has grown to include following features:
* Total buffer size #define-selectable, hence you can measure
  cache-hot and cache-cold performance.
* It does not simply checksum entire buffer, you can do it in 'chunks'.
  Chunk size is a #define too. Chunk order is randomized for eash run
  (this is done to stop fooling us with prefetch from prev chunk to next).
  But you are guaranteed to walk entire buffer.
* Buffer contents are randomized at each run. Csum correctness is checked.
* Buffer copy correctness verified for csum_copy.
* You can set random (up to a #defined value) start and end offset for each
  chunk. Gaps are poisoned before each csum_copy and verified afterwards.
  This has already caught two bugs.
* It benchmarks each routine by running it #defined number of times
  and reporting min/max cycles per kb taken.
* It is easy to add/remove C and asm test routines.
* Easily adaptable for SSE and MMX instruction sets.
* It can make coffee for you. ;)
I'm thinking on how to collect 2-5 best routines and
make 'em compete at kernel init time for the right
to be used for blazing network performance, but did not
even start to code this. Similar approach can be taken
for page clear/copy and copy to/from user routines.
Election of 'best' routine by lkml posts is:
1. Slow
2. Doesn't fit given combination of CPU/mem/mobo
so do _not_ send your results to lkml unless you think
you found something interesting.
FYI, my last results below. kpf_XXX routines are newest'n'greatest.
I found out to my surprize that shortening unrolled loop
on Duron has positive effect.
Coders with 'prefetchless' CPUs are encouraged to write up
their own versions of prefetch-like routines (you may use
mov [mem],reg as a prefetch in the hopes CPU will reorder
instructions and will happily csum older data while such mov
is waiting for data to be fetched. But this needs testing.
That's what this program is for! :-)
