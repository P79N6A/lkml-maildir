Which says that a setting of 15 would get 32k then.
I take it this (for an i386 system) is the correct file to edit?
kernel/ikconfig.h:CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT=14 \n\
Mmmm, that says do not edit, auto-generated, so how about this one?
include/config/log/buf/shift.h
which contains only that single line.  Its now 15 & we'll see.
