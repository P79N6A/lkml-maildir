Yes, userspace can't change it. But if MVFS changes ->vm_file it could also
change vm_flags... But I think you are right anyway, we shouldn't care.
So I have to try to find another bug ;) Suppose that ->load_binary() does
a series of do_mmap(MAP_EXECUTABLE). It is possible that mmap_region() can
merge 2 vmas. In that case we "leak" ->num_exe_file_vmas. Unless I missed
something, mmap_region() should do removed_exe_file_vma() when vma_merge()
succeds (near fput(file)).
