Good point, and your patch looks good; but a couple of reservations.
Trivial: I'd have preferred your error return to be -ENOMEM like all
the rest there, I can't see a good reason for this one to say -EFAULT.
Though apparently nothing cares just so long as it's non-zero.
Less trivial (and I wonder whether you've come to this from an ia64
or a powerpc direction): I notice that ia64 has more stringent REGION
checks in its ia64_do_page_fault, before calling expand_stack or
expand_upwards.  So on that path, the usual path, I think your
new check in acct_stack_growth is unnecessary on ia64; whereas
coming from the get_user_pages find_extend_vma direction,
your check is inadequate?
I'd dearly like to believe that get_user_pages shouldn't be needing
find_extend_vma (it ends up using the wrong task's rlimits); but last
time I researched that, it looked very deliberate, that ptrace be
allowed to expand the stack - I think there's something out there
which would break if that weren't allowed, but I don't know what.
