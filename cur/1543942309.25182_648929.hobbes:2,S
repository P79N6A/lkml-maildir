Looks OK to me - I think I reviewed these a while back?  We really should
have had this tree in -mm for general tyre-kicking.
What's with the #ifdef CONFIG_SLAB stuff in the dmapool code?  Are we just
overloading a convenient Kconfig label here, or is it required for some
reason?  Why not CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG too?
For the future:
This code:
+struct dma_pool *dma_pool_create(const char *name, struct device *dev,
+				 size_t size, size_t align, size_t boundary)
+{
+	struct dma_pool *retval;
+	size_t allocation;
+
+	if (align == 0) {
+		align = 1;
+	} else if (align & (align - 1)) {
+		return NULL;
+	}
+
+	if (size == 0) {
+		return NULL;
+	} else if (size < 4) {
+		size = 4;
+	}
+
+	if ((size % align) != 0)
+		size = ALIGN(size, align);
+
+	allocation = max_t(size_t, size, PAGE_SIZE);
+
+	if (!boundary) {
+		boundary = allocation;
+	} else if ((boundary < size) || (boundary & (boundary - 1))) {
+		return NULL;
+	}
could do with some relief from its brace fetish and some education about
is_power_of_2().  And the `if ((size % align) != 0)' can just go away,
which will save code and is likely faster.
It's a separate thing I guess, but I don't see any reason why
dma_pool_alloc() _has_ to use GFP_ATOMIC.  Looks like it can do the
allocation outside spin_lock_irqsave() and use mem_flags instead.  If that
has __GFP_WAIT then we're in much better shape.
I wish all this code wouldn't do
	struct dma_page *page;
because one very much expects a local variable called "page" to be of type
`struct page *'.
