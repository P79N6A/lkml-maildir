No, the calls to posix_acl_valid() in nfs4_acl_posix_to_nfsv4() ensure
that the passed-in acl has ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER
entries, and hence that these fields will always be initialized.
But I don't want anyone else wasting their time on this.  Should we cave
in and add the initialization here just to shut up gcc?  Or would a
comment here help?
