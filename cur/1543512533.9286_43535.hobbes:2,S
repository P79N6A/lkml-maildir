If you re-spawn the daemon and it gets to see all of the events that have been
stored up, it still does not have a proper view of the device configuration.
The kernel really has to be smarter than just issuing events and buffering
them.
Then doesn't mean that the kernel has to store the device configuration and
you've implemented a sub-set of the underlying device namespace/tracker that
devfs offers?
