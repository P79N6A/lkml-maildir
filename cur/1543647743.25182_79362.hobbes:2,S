	Make sure you are not running CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G.  I believe there
is some kind of memory corruption problem under highmem=64g on x86 with
big ramdisks.  I use a ~900kB initial ramdisk that expands to ~2.2MB.
	With CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G or CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM, the problem disappears
for me.  I am writing this email under 2.5.41 with CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G and
IDE as a module (with a patch that I posted to lkml).
