Subject: NFS warning: mount version older than kernel

OK, I know that this one's in Documentation/Changes.  However, I've
upgraded mount from util-linux-2.9i and I'm still getting the message.  I
am running the RedHat supplied amd -- could that be the source of the
warning?  
I've tried everything I can think of -- if it's important, I'm running the
userland NFS server for now and the server's it's mounting are Suns.
Thanks (pulling on asbestos suit for offtopic question)
Josh
