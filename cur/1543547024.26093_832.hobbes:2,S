   Maybe its time to have FASTCALLFLAGS that is different for sparc ?
The problem not FASTCALL, which is a NOP on sparc anyways.  The
problem is the fact that people expect the following to work:
void foo(unsigned long flags)
{
	restore_flags(flags);
}
void bar(void)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	save_flags(flags);
	foo(flags);
}
And it doesn't on Sparc because the flags are stored in the same CPU
register as the current register window.
Therefore you cannot restore irq flags in a different function than
the one in which you obtained them.
