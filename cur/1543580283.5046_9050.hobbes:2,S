In the case I'm describing, it _works_ if you have a >100us delay. We ask
the chip to do something, and we expect it to take about 100us, so we come
back and start polling for completion after that time.  Actually, we tune
our estimate of how long to back off, depending on how long we've actually
spent polling for completion on previous attempts. But if you _always_
have a 10ms delay, each time you only really needed to wait 100us, then
the performance is appalling.
I'd like to be nice, but I don't want to drop my performance by 100x 
without good reason. Hence the check for need_resched.
Don't confuse this with the code which was mentioned before, which needs 
to send many different words to the chip consecutively. That is done while 
holding a spin_lock. We don't drop the lock and wait between commands in 
that situation.
