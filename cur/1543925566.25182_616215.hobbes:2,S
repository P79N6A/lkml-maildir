This should have been fixed, or it's about to be fixed. My patch is here:
http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/93e5c33fc6e8cff6/39aff558a636ad02
(This patch was superseded by another patch, which may be delayed or mm-only.)
OTOH, if you can implement ARCH= using CONFIG_ARCH, why not? Just don't forget
to keep the scripts running, and make randconfig only select buildable archs.
