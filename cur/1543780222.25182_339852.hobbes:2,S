I tried 2.6.13-rc5-git4, with and without ACPI. They seem to behave
identical:
I haven't seen any more disk trouble, but one of my X displays go black
now and then, forcing me to do a display resize to get it back.  This
does not happen at all with 2.6.13-rc4-mm1.
The display that goes black uses the evdev protocol to read the
second keyboard which is not connected to any tty.  That is a very
new option which could have its own issues, but there where no problems 
in rc4-mm1. It is annoying enough that I don't want to run rc5 for
anything but tests.
