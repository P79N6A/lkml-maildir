The scenario that you've described is exactly what I have in mind as
well. The lack of this feature, which worked fine in 2.6.21, is
holding us back on updating the kernel in our LiveUSB distribution. I
think that this is a feature that would be more and more needed as
portable storage devices start growing in capacity and speed and start
getting smaller in physical size.
Please advise us on how to accomplish this. Kernel boot option; patch;
anything! We'll take anything.
Thanks
