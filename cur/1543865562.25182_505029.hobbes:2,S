Subject: [ANNOUNCE][RFC] PlugSched-6.5 for  2.6.20
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/4/184

The main change in this version is a change to the scheduler driver 
interface to take account of recent changes to the load balancing code.
A patch for 2.6.20 is available at:
<
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-6.5-for-2.6.20.patch?use_mirror=osdn>
Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched,
ingo_ll, nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills, spa_ws, spa_svr, spa_ebs
or zaphod.  If you don't change the default when you build the kernel
the default scheduler will be ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
