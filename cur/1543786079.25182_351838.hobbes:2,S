Right up to 2.6.13-rc6-git12 I've used 
linux-2.6.13-rc6_timeofday-all.patch with no drift at all. With 
unpatched kernels (won't apply) up to 2.6.14-rc1-git5 on SuSE 9.3, I'm 
seeing -3 secs drift since reboot 1 hour ago, I think that's the max 
I've seen over several hours, I have a heat/hardware problem that causes 
a solid lockup at random times.
On the other box with the same hardware and Mandriva LE2005, no drift.
