Is this with -r or without? I didn't get fixed maxima at all on the
celeron box. It also looks like you've changed the interval time to
10ms; nevertheless: a delay of > 10 ms @ a cylce time of 10 ms means
missing the deadlines.
Do you have the possibility to switch off the SMI for your chipset? As
tglx noted on irc recently this may be dangerous because thermal
throtteling can be implemented via SMI, but to get an idea if the SMI is
the reason for the delays, switching it off for a short time should do
the job.
