   That is really nice. Setting the values in the color map don't have to 
be atomic. Programming the hardware color registers do!! You could do a 
loop filling the color map and then do a sync operation that would flush 
the values to the hardware. It would be really nice if sysfs files had 
hooks for syncing so we could do atomic operations :-) 
     I realized for the cursor it is the same things. We have several 
fields to set but we don't want to program the cursor over and over 
again for every slight change. Instead we shoudl cache the changes
until we want to send those changes to the hardware.
