Finding a specific "List" or "Web" or "Tree" from a file is
a pretty easy extension to the current get_maintainer script.
The git_maintainer script could easily be modified to take
a filename rather than a patch file as input too.
There is no specific "parent" information in MAINTAINERS.
Are you suggesting there should be?
Still, it's easy to use directory parentage.
Is that good enough?
For instance:
ATL1 has this maintainer block:
        ATL1 ETHERNET DRIVER
        P: Jay Cliburn
        M: jcliburn@gmail.com
        P: Chris Snook
        M: csnook@redhat.com
        L: atl1-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
        W: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/atl1
        W: 
http://atl1.sourceforge.net
        S: Maintained
        F: drivers/net/atl1/
and NETWORK DEVICE DRIVERS has:
        NETWORK DEVICE DRIVERS
        P: Andrew Morton
        M: akpm@linux-foundation.org
        P: Jeff Garzik
        M: jgarzik@pobox.com
        L: netdev@vger.kernel.org
        T: git kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6.git
        S: Maintained
        F: drivers/net/
So, NETWORK DEVICE DRIVERS would be CC'd on any change
to ATL1 (or any other driver in drivers/net/...)
Of course the same lookup could apply to L: or T:
cheers,  Joe
