Because you want to keep children?  Because you don't want to deal with
the implications for sessions/groups/etc.?
FWIW, syscall makes sense.  It is a valid primitive and the only reason
to keep it out of clone() (i.e. not making it just another flag to clone())
is that clone() is already cluttered _and_ uses bad calling conventions
for that stuff ("I want to retain <list>" rather than "I want private <list>").
