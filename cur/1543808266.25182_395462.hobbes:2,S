No, you're right, the x445 was the box that could have either RSA1 or
RSA2. The x440 can only have an RSA1.

SMIs effectively freeze all cpus while the BIOS code executes. With the
RSA1, there are two main causes of SMIs:
1) Periodic SMI: Which occurs every 15 minutes as the RSA checks various
hardware status and lasts for ~30ms.
2) Console Redirection SMIs: This occurs only when you use the console
redirection feature from the RSA. You'll see ~30ms stalls ~once a second
while the SMI screen-scrapes the console text buffer and sends it out
over the serial line.
The console redirection one is easy to avoid: just don't use that
feature if you care about low latencies. The periodic SMI is more
difficult to work around. With RSA2 based systems, there is a BIOS
update that allows you to disable this functionality (and on newer
systems it ships disabled), however I don't believe there is any such
feature for the older RSA1 based systems.

Yes, not using the console redirection feature will definitly help the
situation, but there still will be the possibility of ~30ms stalls every
15 minutes on the x440.
