Hi Paul,
I've tried your suggestion.
I tried first adding latestcpu( getpid() ), like you've said, but as you
can see from the log this did not yield anything interesting.
I've then tried with latestcpu( gettid() ). The results there surprised my
a bit:
I would've expected to see low times whenever the 2 threads using a DS are
on the same CPU and high times when they are placed on different CPUs.
Also lower times would be expected when the threads aer divided 4 to CPU 0
and 4 to CPU 1 (I've disabled hyperthreading for now).
If you look at the run that took 14.78sec you'll see that only the threads
of 1 out of 4 DS are on same CPU, but result is low. Conversly, look at the
19.55sec reults; same thing happens there.
Pretty much the same can be seen looking at the 14.62 and 19.57 results,
except there the threads of 2 out of 4 DS match.
As for the 2nd presumption, look at times 14.64 and 18.90 - threads are
divided 4 and 4 on both ocassions.
Here are the log files:
(See attached file: latest.tid.log)(See attached file: latest.pid.log)
Any other ideas are highly welcomed.
Marcel

Just for grins, try displaying which cpu each thread runs on.  Display the
return from "latestcpu(getpid())" in the two per-thread printf's, to
display
the thread's cpu at the beginning and end of each compute_thread().
Perhaps
you will notice that the per-thread cpu correlates with the test times.
