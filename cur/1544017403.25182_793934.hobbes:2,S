Nice catch.  I dind't know about the P prefix thing.  It also is used
in other places too.  Hmmm... I can't find anything about the P
argument prefix in the gcc info page (4.3).  Any ideas where I can
find some information about it?  It's a bit weird that it's not a
constraint prefix but an argument one.
Thanks.
