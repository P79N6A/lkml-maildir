There has been a bit of a fork actually... sorry.

That one is quite buggy. The parser is broken ("ps -o %p" fails),
you can get a core dump if you get unlucky with the System.map file,
the BSD-style process selection is incorrect... I've fixed about 100
bugs and introduced only a few.
What you really ought to use is the Debian package. That gives you
my source plus a few fixes that I don't have yet. Head over to
www.debian.org and drill down to the "unstable" package. There you
will find a source tarball and a patch file for it.
