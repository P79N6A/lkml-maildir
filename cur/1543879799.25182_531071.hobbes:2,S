This appears to be a problem for practically all consumer-available
flash media.  They spend a lot of effort trying to hide any flash
properties from their users.  And while this is a decent strategy for
FAT, ext3, ntfs and similar, it is actually very inefficient for a flash
filesystem.
After talking to several manufacturers, most seemed to be fairly
open-minded towards supporting an alternate interface with raw flash
access.  So much for the good news.  Bad news is that such an elternate
interface still needs to be defined.
