	On second thought, it looks like 2.4.2 may also exhibit the
	same behaviro after a little while.  Now that the machine has
	been up for a half hour or so, NFS traffic has become slow on
	my 2.4.2 client again.  I am seeing messages like this in my
	kernel log:
Apr  3 15:01:54 hagrid kernel: nfs: server tela not responding, still trying
Apr  3 15:01:54 hagrid kernel: nfs: server tela OK
	The machines are *not* having any connectivity problems, at
	least judging from TCP sessions I have open between them.
	So it would seem that NFS performace degrades over a very
	short window in 2.4.2+.  It seems to fairly fly when the
	machine is freshly booted, but after 30 minutes or less, the
	performance is severely degraded.
	Is anyone using 2.4.2+ as a NFS server/client with success?
	Am I missing something?
