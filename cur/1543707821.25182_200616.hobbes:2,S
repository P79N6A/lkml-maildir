I though the IBURST that doesn't stick was specific to latest Apple versions ?
Those latest Apple versions are _also_ the ones implementing the magic bug
fix bits (those appeared with the G5).
Or did I get it backward ? Hrm, maybe I did... Here's Apple code:
	fConfiguration	= kConfiguration_TX_DMA_Limit		// default Configuration value
					| kConfiguration_RX_DMA_Limit
					| kConfiguration_Infinite_Burst
					| kConfiguration_RonPaulBit
					| kConfiguration_EnableBug2Fix;
	WRITE_REGISTER( Configuration, fConfiguration );	// try the default
	ui32 = READ_REGISTER( Configuration );				// read it back
    if ( (ui32 & kConfiguration_Infinite_Burst) == 0 )	
    {													// not infinite-burst capable:
        ELG( 0, 0, 'Lims', "UniNEnet::initChip: set TX_DMA_Limit and RX_DMA_Limit." );
		fConfiguration	= (0x02 << 1) | (0x08 << 6);	// change TX_DMA_Limit, RX_DMA_Limit
		WRITE_REGISTER( Configuration, fConfiguration );
    }
What does your doco says ?
Ben.
