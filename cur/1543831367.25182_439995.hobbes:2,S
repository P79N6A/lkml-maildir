The following patches are against 2.6.17-mm5, and reduce the size of
the VFS inode structure by 28 bytes on a UP x86.  (It would be more on
an x86_64 system).  This is a 10% reduction in the inode size on a UP
kernel that is configured in a production mode (i.e., with no spinlock
or other debugging functions enabled; if you want to save memory taken
up by in-core inodes, the first thing you should do is disable the
debugging options; they are responsible for a huge amount of bloat in
the VFS inode structure).
