bootimg is slowly starting to look like the proof of concept I wanted to
have:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-3.tar.gz
Recently added features: can load up to 2 GB, and supports command lines
and initrds (initrd is untested).
There's a README discussing the pending issues. The main problem right
now is the lack of a sane interface to kernel parameters.
It would also be useful if people familiar with the boot process on
non-i386 architectures could have a look at it and tell me if the
approach of turning off paging, putting things at the right spot in
"linear" address mode, and then jumping to some well-known address in
the kernel (i.e. some head*.S) is appropriate there.
An alternative approach would be to keep the existing page tables
around (a la LOBOS) or to create new ones for use during reboot.
Feedback welcome.
