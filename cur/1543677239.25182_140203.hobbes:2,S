The hang and the Nvidia driver crash may be unrelated problems
unfortunately. The first candidate is probably to run memtest86 on
the system, and then to check the usual suspects (fan, psu voltage). 
A crash dump with Nvidia stuff having been loaded is I'm afraid
worthless to anyone but Nvidia in most situations
