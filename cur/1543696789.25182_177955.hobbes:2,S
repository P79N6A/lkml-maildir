Hi Jens,
I was hoping everything ran under the queue lock which should always
have interrupts off on the local CPU. The lock in question is to prevent
a as_completed_request on one queue from racing with as_update_iohist
on another. Each would be on a different CPU.
Maybe I'm wrong, did you actually see misbehaviour?
