no idea, but it shouldnt be nearly as bad as say SLAB_DEBUG.

hm, why? Dont you disable DEBUG_SLAB? [that's a default y option too, 
and in your config it's disabled]
a oneliner script:
 sed -i 's/CONFIG_MUTEX_DEBUGGING=y/# CONFIG_MUTEX_DEBUGGING is not set'
ought to do it, unless i'm missing something.
Really, there's an unfortunate friction of interests here:
on one side, the -mm kernel is about showcasing new code and finding 
bugs in them as fast as possible. Having new debugging options enabled 
by default is an important part of the testing effort. Users will care 
more about having no crashes than about having 0.5% more performance in 
select benchmarks.
on the other side, you obviously dont want a 0.5% overhead for select 
benchmarks, as that would mess up the history! A very fair and valid 
position too.
but one side has to give, we cant have both.

please dont misunderstand my position as being against your efforts - to 
the contrary, your performance regression testing has proven to be 
valuable numerous times! But you are a single intelligent person whom i 
can possibly talk into adding some scripting to ensure that certain 
options stay off in the .config - but i cannot cat-herd the many -mm 
testers on the other hand to all enable the debug options ;-) So i'm 
kind of forced trying to convince you - i cannot convince the basic 
human testing nature of keeping the defaults ;-)
