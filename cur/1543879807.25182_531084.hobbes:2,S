It looks like the workqueue is being run while the log is
being torn down.
On unmount, we write a log record to indicate a clean unmount just
before we tear the log down. We sleep on the iclog force semaphore
waiting for the log I/O to complete, which is processed by xfslogd
and xlog_iodone().
xlog_iodone() calls xlog_state_done_syncing() which processes the I/O
completion and wakes the unmount process sleeping on the semaphore.
xlog_state_done_syncing() then does a bit more work before returning
to xlog_iodone() where we check the buffer to determine if it was an
async I/o or not.
However, before we get to this, the unmount process has woken and
continued onwards which then frees the iclogs and the buffer. Hence
we have a race between xlog_iodone() looking at the buffer and the
unmount process tearing the buffer down.
There's a couple of different ways I can see to fix the problem -
the first is to not reference the buffer in xlog_iodone() after
running the callbacks that may trigger it being freed. I'd prfer to
see if this fixes the problem before having to do more invasive
surgery.  Can you try the patch below to see if it fixes the
problem?

Right - it's not a bug as such. XFS needs lockdep annotations
(being worked on) to prevent this.
