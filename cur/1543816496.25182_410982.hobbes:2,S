Hi Andrew,
Here is an update to this patch to address your concern below.
Basicly, I wait for pending operations to complete, the main concern is an 
expire operation causing directories to be removed. As we hold a reference 
to the vfsmount and the dentry that shouldn't happen once any that are in 
progress have completed.
At least that's what I expect.
