Um, what?  There's no way this doesn't break the ABI.  You do have spare
bytes in the struct, but to use them, you have to add an 'unsigned short'
between dev_fn and board_id:
typedef struct _cciss_pci_info_struct
{
	unsigned char   bus;
	unsigned char   dev_fn;
+	unsigned int    domain;
	__u32           board_id;
}

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
