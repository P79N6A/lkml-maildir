My point of view:
(i) We must not carry this geometry nonsense forward in all
eternity. It is superfluous today. Get rid of it.
(ii) So, the automatic remapping is killed.
Most likely, there will be some people that still have old machines where
this remapping is necessary. Then there are two possible responses:
(iia) Don't run the latest kernel on an old cruft setup. Or,
(iib) Use boot parameters.
So, I am waiting a little, but if there is sufficient demand
we must have boot parameters that ask for an OnTrack remapping.
Concerning your particular case, I expect that you'll find that
your remapping is entirely superfluous.
If you like low level fiddling, boot from a floppy, e.g. tomsrtbt,
adapt the partition table and reboot. Now all should be well,
both under old and under new kernels. No data loss.
If you don't know how to fiddle, boot from a floppy, wipe the MBR
using dd if=/dev/zero, and reinstall. All data is lost.
Many intermediate approaches are possible.
We can discuss details in case you are interested.
