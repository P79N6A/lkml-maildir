Subject: [PATCH 1/22] ppc64: Dynamic LPAR bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

01-hotplug-bugfix.patch
In the current 2.6.14-rc2-git6 kernel, performing a Dynamic LPAR Add 
of a hotplug slot will crash the system, with the following (abbreviated) 
stack trace:
cpu 0x3: Vector: 700 (Program Check) at [c000000053dff7f0]
    pc: c0000000004f5974: .__alloc_bootmem+0x0/0xb0
    lr: c0000000000258a0: .update_dn_pci_info+0x108/0x118
        c0000000000257c8 .update_dn_pci_info+0x30/0x118 (unreliable)
        c0000000000258fc .pci_dn_reconfig_notifier+0x4c/0x64
        c000000000060754 .notifier_call_chain+0x68/0x9c
The root cause was that __init __alloc_bootmem() was called long after 
boot had finished, resulting in a crash because this routine is undefined
after boot time.  The patch below fixes this crash, and adds some docs to 
clarify the code.
p.s. congrats to all for getting slashdotted on this yesterday!
