In particular:
1. a diffprofile between the two would be interesting (assuming it's
at least partly increase in kernel time), or any other way to see exactly
why it's slower (well, TLB flushes, obviously, but what's causing them).
2. If it's gettimeofday hammering it (which it probably is, from previous
comments by others, and my own experience), then vsyscall gettimeofday
(John's patch) may well fix it up.
3. Are you using the extra user address space? Otherwise yes, it'll be 
all downside. And 4/4 vs 3/1 isn't really a fair comparison ... 4/4 is
designed for bigboxen, so 4/4 vs 2/2 would be better, IMHO. People have
said before that DB performance can increase linearly with shared area
sizes (for some workloads), so that'd bring you a 100% or so increase
in performance for 4/4 to counter the loss.
