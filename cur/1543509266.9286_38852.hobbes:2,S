That's definetly not what I can reproduce here. I don't own scsi hardware
at all so I would have noticed if IDE+SMP would be extremely unstable. I
can't exclude there's some subtle bug of course, but that's sure not
trivial to reproduce on sane hardware.
To debug the thing you should do three thing:
1) make sure to be on the virtual console at lockup time
2) press SYSRQ+P at lockup time (SYSRQ compiled in)
3) if (2) is useless apply the IKD patch and enable the NMI oopser with
   irq source 0 (default) and wait an Oops at lockup time
3) if (3) does not Oops at lockup time, then disable the NMI oopser
   and enable the PRINT-EIP feature and make sure to have the two EIP 
   boxes focused on the virtual console at lockup time. Write them on
   paper ordered according to the second and fouth box.
the ikd patch is here:
