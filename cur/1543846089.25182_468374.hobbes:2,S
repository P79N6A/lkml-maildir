Well, not in all languages: You know, in other languages the "display"
word's first letter isn't "d", so "LCD display" looks good at least in
spanish, as we don't translate the english acronym. ;-)

I find "LC display" ugly, not "LCD". I know in english looks bad, I'm
trying to find the best way to write it, I have no preference between
them.
I think I will choose "LCD" for all places, also the pathname: drivers/lcd/
I will wait for the V7 to get reviewed, then I will fix it for the V8.
