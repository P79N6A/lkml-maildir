The answers differ for 2.4 and 2.6. For 2.4 each keypress is a keypress,
and key releases are rather unimportant as long as the key is not a
modifier key. For 2.6 we have synthetic repeat, so a second keypress from
the keyboard is ignored, the key repeats with kernel-defined frequency,
and the repeat is ended by the key release.

If a key release is not seen, 2.4 doesnt mind, but 2.6 keeps repeating.

Do not recall all items of all letters I answer - sorry.
