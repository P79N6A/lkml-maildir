Hmm.  That means we'd have to do the same thing in dpm_power_up() in case
someone calls destroy_suspended_device() from resume_device_early(dev).
Still, even doing that is not enough, since someone can call
destroy_suspended_device() from a .suspend() routine and then the device
will end up on a wrong list just as well.
