Very true.  At best, we pick one card we know it could work on, and
one target that we know is smart about tags, and try to demonstrate
the improvement.

The main way the barriers could help performance is by allowing the
drive to write all the transaction and commit blocks at once.  Your
idea increases the chance the drive heads will still be correctly 
positioned to write the commit block, but doesn't let the drive 
stream things better.
The big advantage to using wait_on_buffer() instead is that it doesn't
order against data writes at all (from bdflush, or some other proc
other than a commit), allowing the drive to optimize those
at the same time it is writing the commit.  Using ordered tags has the
same problem, it might just be that wait_on_buffer is the best way to 
go.
