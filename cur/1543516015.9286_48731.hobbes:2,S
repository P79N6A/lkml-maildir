2.3.x we have support for PCI based I2O devices talking I2O lan, I2O scsi
and I2O block to I2O spec 1.5. 
Linux 2.2 has a board specific driver the Red Creek VPN card and you can
get a board specific driver the DPT Decade/Century/Millenium series cards

Unless the system is unusual you should get better performance by increasing
main memory rather than disk controller cache size. How much you want on the
board is obviously vendor specific.
