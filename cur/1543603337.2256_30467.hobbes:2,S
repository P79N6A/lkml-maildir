the latest, -D9 patch does this. If drivers provide a (backwards
compatible) ->poll_controller() call then they can be polled by kpolld.
There are also a few points within the networking code that trigger a poll
pass, to make sure events are processed even if networking-intensive
applications take away all CPU time from kpolld. The device is only polled
if the IRQ is detected to be in overload mode. IRQ-overload protection
does not depend on the existence of the availability of the
->poll_controller(). The poll_controller() call is very simple for most
drivers. (It has to be per-driver, because not all drivers advance their
state purely via their device interrupts.)
but kpolld itself and auto-mitigation is not limited to networking - any
other driver framework that has high-irq-load problems can use it.

yep - this does not happen anymore, at least under the loads i tested
which otherwise choke a purely irq-driven machine. (It will happen in a
gradual way if load is increased further, but that is natural.)
