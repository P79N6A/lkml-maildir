AFAIK, BK is not covered by patents.  This means that anyone can
legally write software with similar functionality, without doing
anything illegal, or (IMHO) immoral, as long as no code is copied from
the original product.  This applies to other progams, as well.  I
don't see anything wrong with taking inspiration from other programs,
when writing your own.  Sure, it might not take the same effort to
create a program similar to an already existing one, as to think of
totally new, great idea for how to do something.  With your reasoning,
all version control programs are stolen from the first one, whatever
that was (does anyone remember?).

Nowdays very few programs show any genuinely new ideas.  For the
greater part, they are new implementations of very old concepts.  Take
Microsoft.  They produce operating systems and word processors.  They
were not by far the first to do either of these.  Actually, I can't
think of anything where MS has come up with something really new.  The
idea of using a display (possibly graphical) with multiple windows was
at one time such a new thing.  This does not mean that any subsequent
implementation of such a system is copied, or stolen, from the
original inventor (who was that?).  If an idea is special enough, it
can be patented.  This protects it from being used by anyone else for
some time.  Good examples are MPEG video compression and RSA
cryptography.  Fortunately, not everything can be patented.
