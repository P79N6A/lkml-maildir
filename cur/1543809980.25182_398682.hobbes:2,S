Maybe yes, since putting wcwidth() into the kernel is a bigger kludge, 
because linux kernel will never draw CJK, and because after glibc 
update, kernel and glibc might disagree upon wcwidth of some characters.
So on linux console, ncurses should draw two 0xfffd characters when a 
character with wcwidth > 1 is requested.

Not sure. I will test putty a bit later. Anyway, an environment variable 
for this kludge may be a good idea.
