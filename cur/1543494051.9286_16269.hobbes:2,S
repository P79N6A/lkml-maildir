This was the cause of the famous "Windows 95/98 crashes after 49.7 days"
problem, which of course remained undiscovered until this year because
nobody had managed to keep their system up that long...  Apparently that was
counting genuine milliseconds which gives 49.7.  2**-10 of a second would
give 48.5 days.
