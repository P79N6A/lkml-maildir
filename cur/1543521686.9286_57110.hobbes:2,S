You can look at mount as a fancy version of link. We have hard links (any
file), we have soft links (pointers to location), nothing prevents us from
having "mount links".
As for swapon we can make "/proc/memory/swap/" directory with semantics
that when we make "mount link" in it it adds swap. 
My own opinion is that  sufficiently  generic model can always explain
other models in its own terms. However, abstract models aside, one should
look at the nature of what he/she is trying to accomplish to make a
decision.
 What is block device ? An array of records. The size of it doesn't
change while in use. The records can be stored an retrieved.
 What is character device ? (I'll take an example of serial port)  
Communications channel - you can read and write to it, but usually
data read and written is not preserved. Its size depends on the amount
of data available to be read. (or you can say that size is not defined)
 What is file ? mixture of both. You can consider it as array of records
and you read and write from it. 
 Now I think it's obvious that block devices and character devices are 
two different beasts. Whatever you do in the end a device driver _will_
have to distinguish them - because it deals with a physical device and 
not an abstract concept.
