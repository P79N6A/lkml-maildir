Um, no; _many_ machines have USB.
[The boards I work with all have a UART _on the CPU chip_, so it's
pretty cheap to give them a serial connection, and many of them have a
network connection because it's needed -- but none of them have USB...
Even if you're talking about just PCs, most of the PCs I use are
slightly old, and don't have USB; maybe I'm just from mars or something,
but it's always kind of annoying to see people talking as if USB were
universal...]
