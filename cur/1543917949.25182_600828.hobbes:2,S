The patch is totally bogus. irq 0 doesn't say anything about whether
the current CPU still works or not. You always need some local
interrupt. This basically disables the NMI watchdog for the non boot CPUs.
It's even wrong on i386 -- i wonder how that broken patch
made it in there. I'll remove it there.
