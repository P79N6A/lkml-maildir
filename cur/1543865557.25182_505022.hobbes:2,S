What part of "Only valid for packet sockets" from the manual page
escapes you?  :-))
It's a feature which only was meant to be valid for AF_PACKET sockets.
What UDP is doing is different, it's returning the full packet length
when the packet is larger then the given buffer size, but it does this
irregardless of whether you set MSG_TRUNC in the recvmsg() passed-in
flags.  UDP itself sets the MSG_TRUNC flag when it detects this
situation.
I checked the history and our AF_UNIX sockets have always behaved like
this.
