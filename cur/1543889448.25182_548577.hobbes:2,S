AppArmor doesn't label files; it's a different model from SELinux. Its policy 
defines which processes may access which paths. Even if for some reson the 
same files were visible elsewhere, the policy wouldn't cover those other 
paths, and so accessing them would be denied. So again, that's not a security 
hole.

The model is explained, with examples, in the technical documentation at 
http://forgeftp.novell.com//apparmor/LKML_Submission-May_07/.
