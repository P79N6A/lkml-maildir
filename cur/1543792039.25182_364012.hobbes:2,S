Because it's their job.
As long as a vendor supports a release of his distribution, the absolute 
minimum he has to provide are regular security fixes for all the 
software the release offers - including the kernels shipped with the 
release.
E.g. the latest security update RedHat offered for the kernel 2.4.9 (sic) 
used in their version 2.1 server products was two months ago.
And they will provide security updates until 2009.
