The problem I have is that you want to separate _all_ constants, which 
doesn't really make sense to me, because many of them are useless without 
the correspending structures.

Please define the problem more specific. :)

The bootloader is no kernel code and thus the elf header pull in a lot 
less:
$ gcc -c foo.c -Iusr/include --trace-includes
. usr/include/linux/elf.h
.. usr/include/linux/types.h
... usr/include/linux/posix_types.h
.... usr/include/linux/stddef.h
.... usr/include/asm/posix_types.h
... usr/include/asm/types.h
.. usr/include/linux/auxvec.h
... usr/include/asm/auxvec.h
.. usr/include/linux/elf-em.h
.. usr/include/asm/elf.h
... usr/include/asm/ptrace.h
.... usr/include/asm/ptrace-abi.h
... usr/include/asm/user.h
.... usr/include/asm/page.h
One could remove ptrace.h but otherwise the result looks quite reasonable.

Some of it you could put into linux/elf, e.g.:
#if ELF_CLASS == ELFCLASS32
typedef Elf32_Ehdr     Elf_Ehdr;
typedef Elf32_Phdr     Elf_Phdr;
typedef Elf32_Shdr     Elf_Shdr;
typedef Elf32_Sym      Elf_Sym;
typedef Elf32_Dyn      Elf_Dyn;
typedef Elf32_Rel      Elf_Rel;
typedef Elf32_Rela     Elf_Rela;
typedef Elf32_Addr     Elf_Addr;
#elif ELF_CLASS == ELFCLASS64
typedef Elf64_Ehdr     Elf_Ehdr;
typedef Elf64_Phdr     Elf_Phdr;
typedef Elf64_Shdr     Elf_Shdr;
typedef Elf64_Sym      Elf_Sym;
typedef Elf64_Dyn      Elf_Dyn;
typedef Elf64_Rel      Elf_Rel;
typedef Elf64_Rela     Elf_Rela;
typedef Elf64_Addr     Elf_Addr;
#else
#error
#endif

The patch does help you quite a bit, you don't have to cleanup elf.h so 
it's usable by the whole kernel. Only few parts now really need it and 
depend on it, which makes the extensive splitup unnecessary only to 
reduce header dependencies.
