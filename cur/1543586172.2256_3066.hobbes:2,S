The point is to avoid acquring costly locks, so it is a question of 
relative cost. Disabling preemption (by an atomic increment) for 
short critical sections may not be as bad as spin-waiting for 
highly contended locks or thrashing lock cachelines.

None of the two two-phase update implementations (synchronize_kernel())
by Rusty and read-copy update by us, monitor the tasks that require
sync for update. synchronize_kernel() forces a schedule on every
cpu and read-copy update waits until every cpu goes through
a quiscent state, before updating. Both approaches will require
significant special handling because they implicitly assume 
that tasks inside the kernel are bound to the current cpu until it
reaches a quiescent state (like a "normal"
context switch). Since preempted tasks can run later on any cpu, we
will have to keep track of sync points on a per-task basis and
that will probably require using a snapshot of the running
tasks from the global runqueue. That may not be a good thing
from performance standpoint, not to mention the complexity.
Also, in situations where read-to-write ratio is not heavily
skewed towards read or lots of updates happening, a very low
priority task can have a significant impact on performance
by getting preempted all the time.
