Thanks Alan.  The original question was: if an urb fails with an error,
is there any point in resubmitting it after a delay (which is what the
driver usually does) if the error was -ESHUTDOWN?  It sounds like there
is no point to it.  And if the device is not disconnected, then it could
even be harmful since the urb will be resubmitted endlessly...  While on
the topic, are there any other error codes for which an urb should not be
resubmitted?
Thanks again,
Duncan.
