   Such as?
/proc/net, /proc/sys, and /proc/fs definitely doesn't belong in /dev.  I
would think that's pretty self-evident.

   Explain to me how this is different from mounting devfs onto /kernel
   and using devfsd to populate a disc-based /dev.
It isn't, as long as the names given by devfs are specific enough that a
user-mode daemon knows what the device is.  So if devfs is creating
names like sda1, or c0t0d0s4, this isn't useful.  Names like:
/kernel/devices/pci/adapecc2980_0/... aren't something you'd *want* to
appear in /dev, and indeed they don't appear in /dev under Solaris.
They appear in /devices under Solaris.  This is not an accident.
   But this is a straw-man argument, because it ignores the persistence
   problem with a dynamic disc-based /dev which is managed with a user
   space daemon. This is a problem that's been overlooked.
   Consider what happens if your daemon creates and deletes device
   entries based on information from the kernel as to what devices are
   installed (and drivers loaded). When a new device is plugged in, *what
   permissions should be given*? OK, say you get some default. So the
   sysadmin does chmod(1) to change this.
   What happens if a device is removed?  The daemon deletes the device
   entry. Then the device is plugged back in again. *What permissions
   will be given*?
What makes you think the daemon should delete the device entry?  I
wouldn't.  I would keep it there, since the device entry is cheap, and
most of the time when a device is removed it's likely to come back
later.  In the rare case where hardware is being physically removed and
it will never come back, the system administrator can simply delete the
device for good later.
   Again I'll ask the question I've already asked a number of times. How
   would you cleanly support a construct like this:
      opendir ("/dev/ide/cd");
      loop;
1)  I don't think this is useful.
2)  Even if it is useful, it shouldn't be done via /dev.  Via /proc, or
    the hypothetical /kernel/devices interfaces, perhaps, but not /dev.
   Except that devfs isn't a mistake. It's the Right Thing[tm].
That's you're opinion; it's not mine.
