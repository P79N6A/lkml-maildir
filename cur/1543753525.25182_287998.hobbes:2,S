I could hack the threads that the test actually uses just to get some
numbers.  But, that will break some existing JACK clients.

I usually call them `realtime threads' and `non-realtime threads'.
Means the same thing.  I think of them that way, because any code
running in a realtime thread is severely constrained.  It must be
written *very* carefully, almost like a hardware interrupt handler.

Good idea, thanks.
These tests mean a lot more running "real" audio programs.  :-)

JACK actually uses three different priorities, the defaults are 9, 10
and 20.  How about if I change this test?
	if (prio <= 20 && policy != SCHED_NORMAL) {
Or, should that be?
	if (prio > 0 && prio <= 20 && policy != SCHED_NORMAL) {
