This starts to look really fishy:
hch@bird:/repo/repo/linux-2.5/fs/jbd$ egrep -r NOFAIL *
journal.c:      new_bh = alloc_buffer_head(GFP_NOFS|__GFP_NOFAIL);
journal.c:      return kmalloc(size, flags | (retry ? __GFP_NOFAIL :
0));
both of these end up in the slab layer, just like XFS - except
that __cache_alloc still may fail.  Looks like whe're better of
fixing mm/slab.c
