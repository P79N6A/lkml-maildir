The PF_MEMDIE flag is there so the oom killer doesn't just sit there
hitting the same task over and over again.
We leave PF_MEMDIE set because we expect the task to exit, or to not want
any more oomkiller attention.
The SIGTERM behaviour is there because the CAP_SYS_RAWIO process may need
to release critical resources.
So as long as your process has CAP_SYS_RAWIO, everything happens to work as
you want it.  I don't think it was really designed that way though.

Well it's all very unconventional.  Catching SIGTERM seems like a suitable
way to do what you want to do.
Possibly your special process should also run as PF_MEMALLOC.  I've seen
that done before, with success.  There is no existing API with which this
can be set.
