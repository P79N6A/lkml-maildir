Hi, i've been having a problem with my usb zip drive (older 100mb model)
it's 100% repeateble: 
copy a large file to anywhere, and within a minute or so: 
copy stops dead.
and the following appears in the syslog:
Jun  3 21:10:56 int-21h kernel: uhci: host controller process error. something bad happened
Jun  3 21:10:56 int-21h kernel: uhci: host controller halted. very bad
my machine is a K6-3/350, kernel 2.4.2, via mvp3 chipset
if you need any more info, please let me know,
Thanks
David F.
