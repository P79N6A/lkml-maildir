I started seeing these occaisionally on my SMP boxes about a month or
two ago, is anyone else seeing something similar?
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,17)): ext2_find_entry: zero-length directory entry
Upon reboot e2fsck is forced to run (since the partition is marked as
having errors by the kernel) and no problems are discovered.
Any clues?
