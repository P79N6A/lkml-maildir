So your 2.4.34.5 tree is wrong, you forgot to apply 2.4.34.4 to it,
which only fixes this goto. You should rebuild your 2.4.34.X tree
from scratch.

No, once again, you should not apply any 2.4.35-preX to 2.4.34.X.
You should apply it to plain 2.4.34.
If you don't have it anymore, I suggest that you revert the 2.4.34.X
patches with "patch -R".
Also, I think you got a lot of rejects when applying 2.4.35 on top of
2.4.34.X since most changes are the sames.
