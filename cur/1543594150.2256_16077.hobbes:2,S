i use all of the above and also require some of the new feature though you 
say good for academic in the UK most of the places are still running 486's 
as workstations when they come to though them out soon you wanna at least 
let the run a linux course with them first :)

these are possible in greater usage than you think. isdn cards still look 
like serial ports etc... scanner and where do you plug a joy stick in i 
have never even seen a usb joystick. hey i dont even have USB ports.
though i do agree that there is alot of stuff there but its still mostly 
drivers.
