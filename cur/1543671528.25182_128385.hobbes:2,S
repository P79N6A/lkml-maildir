Linux supports up to 4 GB (~2^32 bytes) of memory on 32-bit
architectures and 64 GB (~2^36 bytes) on x86 with PAE. No other
operating system can support more on 32-bit since it is a limitation of
the hardware.
On 64-bit systems, Linux supports up to 16 EB (~2^64 bytes) of memory,
which is about 16 million times more than the 1 TB limit of MS.
Current Linux 2.4 allows 32 CPUs for 32-bit arches and 64 CPUs on 64-bit
arches. However, this limit is (was?) being removed in 2.5, so you can
have up to 32767 CPUs, which should be enough for you right now.
(Note: I said _right now_, lest anybody make jokes about 640K limit)
