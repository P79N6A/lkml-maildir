Thanks to Andreas and Costabel for their kind replies to me. Let me say
first of all that I agree that the PPC guys do a great job. My intention
wasn't to criticise them.

Hmmmm.... I just tried recompiling the vanilla tree (2.2.14) and it won't
compile without my patch. Can you explain how pmac_setup.c can compile
without the patch? On my machine, it can't find ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD.
Is there stuff I can do to help to merge the new 2.3.x stuff for PPC
without extensive knowledge of kernel internals? I'm learning but still
have a long way to go in understanding the kernel.
Regards,
Peter
