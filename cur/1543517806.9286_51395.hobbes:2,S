Any progress on this for 2.2.x?
Running 2.2.10pre9 NFS server and 2.2.10pre10 NFS client, I can kill NFS
reproducibly with high traffic.
No NFS errors on the server, the following errors on the client:
rpc_release_client: nfs client already free??
rpc_release_client: nfs client already free??
rpc_release_client: nfs client already free??
rpc_release_client: nfs client already free??
rpc_release_client: nfs client already free??
