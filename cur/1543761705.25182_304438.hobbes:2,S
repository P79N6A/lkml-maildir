Guess that means Linus hasn't flipped his lid. So we won't see Linux-4.0
for MSVC any time soon.
Heh he - the ultimate virus would be if a Linux kernel could install
itself onto a NTFS partition and take over from the Windows kernel code.
Then MS would have way less support issues, we'd be hailed saviours, and
achieve world domination through the back door.

Namely seems to happen around the times when I'm doing something like
mounting devfs (takes nearly 30 secs), and when I'm accessing files from
disc (bash$ less some-random-file.txt) - this can take about two seconds
for Linux to actually notice I've done something. I've no idea where the
error is here, either. i.e. is bash waiting around for me? is the
filesystem code waiting for some reason? Is the kernel in a tailspin?

CC if you wish, but I ought to be watching the list again for this one.
