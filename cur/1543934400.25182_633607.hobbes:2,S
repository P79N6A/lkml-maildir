Thank you very much.

Yes, my previous patch already took care of it. Thanks.

Hmm, I can not agree, because it is possible to insert a kprobe
into kprobe's instruction buffer. If it should be a bug, we must
check it when registering the kprobe.
(And also, in *p->ainsn.insn == BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION case, I doubt
that the kernel can handle this "orphaned" breakpoint, because the
breakpoint address has been changed.)
Anyway, if you would like to change the logic, please separate it from
cleanup patch.

OK, I see.

Oh, I just mentioned about this "if (!ret)" condition.
Could you try to remove this "ret" variable?
I think some "ret=1" could be replaced by "return 1" easily.
