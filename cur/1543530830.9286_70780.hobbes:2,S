Indeed. I think the problem is really that the size of the pipes is equal
to the guarenteed atomic write. It would be really nice if pipes were
bigger so that a program that trickles bytes into a pipe wouldn't always block
on select until the other side bothered to read. I would propose to make
pipe size twice PIPE_BUF.
(the current setup is not wrong, but it makes certain types of apps
unnecesarily slow)
