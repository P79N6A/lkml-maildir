I'm late tuning in here, but:
(1) hdparm issues only a single read at a time, so NCQ won't help it.
(2) WD Raptor drives automatically turn off "read-ahead" when using NCQ,
which totally kills any throughput measurements.  They do this to speed
up random access seeks; dunno if it pays off or not.  Under Windows,
the disk drivers don't use NCQ when performing large I/O operations,
which avoids the performance loss.
(3) Other drives from other brands may have similar issues,
but I have not run into it on them yet.
Cheers
