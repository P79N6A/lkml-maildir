From what I know minimal decoder cards are ancient PCI cards. None of
the current hardware does this.
Caching would only occur:
1) when a kernel driver for the card loads
2) and if the kernel driver asks for it
So normal hardware would never ask for the cache since it isn't needed.
In the normal hardware case direct ROM access is used. If the
minimalistic hardware is using a user space driver it won't ask for the
cache either. The only time you get cached is on minimal hardware and
when the driver asks for it. Since the driver is asking for the cache
you have to assume that it needs it so the memory isn't wasted.
