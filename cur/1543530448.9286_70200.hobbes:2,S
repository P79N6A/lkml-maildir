    Donald, Jeff,
    I just want to say how much we appreciate the work you are doing on
these drivers.  We use Kingston cards across the boards on all our
production machines with 2.0.x kernels.  It is very important to us to
have uniform ether support across all machines in our ISP. For example
when Kingston moved to the 21143 chip this caused problems with FD and we
had to scramble to get things working again.
    So just want you to know you are appreciated.
    Homer
