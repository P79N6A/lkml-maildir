i did not find out about the most fundamental problem until today, when i
tried to merge your patch. Much of Linux's development is trial & err, i
do that all the time as well.

the fundamental problem is with wait_task_inactive() called from IRQ
contexts - it can spin indefinitely. The above comments list some of the
other problems, and those can indeed be solved by extending the IPI
delivery mechanism, which you did.
migration threads are a variation of the current scheduler as well -the
schedule()/wakeup() hotpath did not have to be touched.
