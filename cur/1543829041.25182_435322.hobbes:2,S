Um, this isn't the relevant code.  You're interested in sr.c, not sd.c.  
Furthermore, the actual ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command is caused by code in 
drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:cdrom_release().  This needs to be coordinated (the 
cdi->use_count variable) with the sg driver.

Look at include/scsi/scsi_device.h.  There's plenty of opportunity for 
adding an additional counter.
