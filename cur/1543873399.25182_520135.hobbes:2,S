Well, "actual execution time" is a bit ambiguous: should that be "time
actually spent executing", or "time we should have spent executing"?
It looks like cpu_clock_sample() will only return accurate results on
yourself; if you get the sched_ns on a thread on another cpu, it won't
include the time accumulated since the start of its timeslice.
