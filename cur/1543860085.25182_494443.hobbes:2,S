i see no fundamental disadvantage from doing both. That way the 'market' 
of applications will vote. (we have 2 other fundamental types available 
as well: sync IO and poll() based IO - so it's not like we have the 
choice between 2 or 1 variant, we have the choice between 4 or 3 
variants)

yeah. The internal machinery should be as unified as possible - but 
different sets of APIs can be offered, to make it easy for people to 
extend their existing apps in the most straightforward way.
(In fact i'd like to see all the 'poll table' code to be unified into 
this as well, if possible - it does not really "poll" anything, it's an 
event infrastructure as well, used via the naive select() and poll() 
syscalls. We should fix that naming mistake.)
