The issue here was a little bit different. On the contrary to poll(2), 
with epoll and fd in resident inside the interest set, and epoll allows 
you to set the interest event mask to 0. In such condition, epoll does 
report POLLHUP and POLLERR events of the 0 masked fd, and this was the 
original Ben's argoument. Looking at poll(2) though, it seems that it does 
the same thing if you set the event mask to 0. So epoll is coherent with 
poll(2) in this. I personally believe that an application should handle 
those exceptional events in any case, by simply removing the fd from the 
epoll set (and lazily freeing the associated userspace data structures).
So, if no big argouments will come against this, I'd rather prefer to keep 
such behaviour. OTOH the patch would be trivial (one or two lines) , so 
there will be no design problems in doing this.
