Hmm. You are right.
Is there a way another user-level program/utility access some of the
data maintained in those arrays ?

Does this mean that I can do something like
	page_cache[0xffff8100c4c6b298] = $mapping->nrpages ?
And this won't generate bloated arrays ?
Here is what I wrote earlier to capture some of the pagecache data.
Unfortunately, I can't capture whatever happend before inserting the
problem. So it won't give me information about all whats there in the
pagecache.
BTW, if you prefer - we can move the discussion to systemtap.
(I have few questions/issues on ret probes & accessability of
arguments - since I want to do this on return).
Thanks,
Badari
