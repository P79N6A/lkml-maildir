Can't you just create a pre-reserved separate swsusp area on disk the size 
of RAM (maybe a partition rather than a file to make things easier), and 
then you know you're safe (basically what Marc was suggesting, except pre-allocated)? Or does that make me the prince of all evil? ;-)
However much swap space you allocate, it can always all be used, so that
seems futile ...
