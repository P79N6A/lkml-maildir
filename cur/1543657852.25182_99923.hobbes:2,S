	Thank you for the help for everyone the compile was successful.
With preempt didn't boot the machine. This is a possible couse only, I
made more changes between the two version's (booting and not booting)
config.
	After booting I can't insmod (even with insmod nor with modprobe)
anything with the following error message:
mortimer:~# modprobe nfs
WARNING: Error inserting sunrpc (/lib/modules/2.5.54/kernel/net/sunrpc/sunrpc.ko): Cannot allocate memory

FATAL: Error inserting nfs (/lib/modules/2.5.54/kernel/fs/nfs/nfs.ko): Cannot allocate memory
With strace I found this, is it normal?
