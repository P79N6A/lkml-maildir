I strongly agree.  I first tripped over this problem when I was trying
to identify the responsible parties for [Cc]onfig.in files.  It's
biting me again now that I'm trying to clean up the CONFIG_ space.
It's one that's going to cause grief for anybody trying to do *global*
work on the kernel, stuff that crosses boundaries between maintainer
jurisdictions.

The spirit of this proposal is, IMO, excellent.  I like the idea that if
maintainer information for a particular piece of the hierarchy doesn't
exist, you float up to the next higher level.  Search always ends at
the root MAINTAINERS file.
And I could indeed write a program such as Andreas describes, and would
be most willing to do so.
I have one objection, however.  I think the maintainers information
should normally be inline of the file in question, so there won't
be a need for an explicit F: link that could become invalid.  So I
think the search order should look like this:
	1. Look for maintainer markup in the file itself.
	2. Then look for a NAINTAINERS file in the current directory.
	3. Then look upwards for MAINTAINERS files in enclosing directories.

I have until 6 May at least to work on this, if there is consensus that it's
a good idea.
