Almost all of "region 7" (0xE000000000000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) of the kernel
address space is defined to have a 1:1 mapping with physical memory (the exception
being the top 64K (0xFFFFFFFFFFFF0000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) which is mapped as
a per-cpu area).  So __pa(x) is simply defined as ((x) - PAGE_OFFSET). Using
__pa(start) is effectively identical to (start - PAGE_OFFSET), but __pa() is
a bit cleaner and easier to read.
