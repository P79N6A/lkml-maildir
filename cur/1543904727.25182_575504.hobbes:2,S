(Side note: I'm not claiming this (or it's mirror image (d)) is really any 
better/worse than the current behaviour from a theoretical standpoint, but 
at least the current behaviour is _tested_, which makes it better in 
practice. So if we want to change this, I think we want to change it to 
something that is _obviously_ better).
