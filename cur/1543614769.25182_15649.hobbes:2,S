Don't forget that any change that affects a file's #include list
(including patches) requires you to run make dep.
make dep does not handle generated files at all, change the code that
generates a file and the file is regenerated but make dep did not pick
up the file the first time so kbuild 2.4 does not detect the change.
Another make dep will fix that of course.  So now we have
  Run make dep after -
    A change to .config.
    Any source change, it might have changed the #include list.
    Any source or command line change that affects generated files.
How do you automate that?  You end up saying that you always run make
dep.

For people who know what they are doing, not for the larger population
that are struggling with the kernel build process.  kbuild 2.5 is
designed to work accurately and automatically for everyone, from the
high druids of the kernel down to the lowliest newbie.
