I have a similar problem at the moment, i have setup my box with gentoo 
and now i get hardlocks from time to time (time < 1.5 days), happens 
with and without x, kernel 2.4.27 untainted, with apic on and off, acpi 
on and off, apm on and off...
@zergio: Can you tell me if it only happened with 2.4.27?
The system is really stuck when it crashes. My wireless keyboard has a 
led to indicate traffic, an when system hangs, not even the led would 
blink, it just stays in either on or off state (its normaly off). No 
disk activity, mouse is locked, display remains unchanged (x.org nv or 
plain (non-fbdev) console). Havent tried so far to reach the box over 
network, but is suspect it will not work.
@developers:
Maybe thats a hint, could it be that a broken keyboard induces such 
behaviour?
Im going to change kernel to 2.4.24 (had uptimes > 14 days with it) and 
see if it helps.
As far as i can see, nothing was written to the logs, no messages, it 
just peacefully dies...
