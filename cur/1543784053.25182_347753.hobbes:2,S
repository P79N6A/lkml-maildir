Really it shouldn't, I'm just adding the extra casting to be more
explicit to if at some point in the future a bug does creep up, it will
be easier to understand. The code is assuming we're unsigned, so why not
make that clear to the compiler?
Granted, its not really all that critical and it is a bit paranoid. I
just figured I'd float the patch to see if folks thought it would be a
good idea.
