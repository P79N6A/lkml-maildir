It failed to do so in my testing.  The only safe way of flushing 
global entries is to disable them in cr4 before attempting the 
tlb flush.

Doh.  I should consume coffee after waking up but before posting...

I'd still prefer to get the typing of the page table manipulations 
correct.  Also, the code can prematurely revert to 4MB mappings if 
the caller does anything awry, like changing the attributes back to 
standard attributes on the same page twice.  The usage of #ifdef __i386__ 
is inconsistent, too.
