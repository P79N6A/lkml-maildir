Hmm.. Have you actually ever seen this?
When tsk->mm is NULL, you should never EVER get a page fault, except for 
the one special case of the vmalloc'ed area (which is tested for in 
do_page_fault() before we even _look_ at "tsk->mm").
In fact, do_page_fault() very much checks
	if (in_atomic() || !mm)
		goto no_context;  
which says that a page fault when in a lazy TLB context should always
cause a trap, killing the thing (or, if the access has a fixup, calling
the fixup - although I don't think that should happen in any normal code)
In other words: I think your patch is "functionally correct", in that it
should work fine, but on the other hand having a NULL tsk->mm and trying
to do any user-level access is _so_ wrong that I'd much rather take a NULL
pointer fault than try to do something "sane" about it.
