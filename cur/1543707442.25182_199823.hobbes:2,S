I should know better than to stir up a hornets nest
by discussing GPL issues on this list... :)

Actually, this would tend towards an interpretation that
it was NOT a derived work.
That is, if a the Linux kernel must be modified in order
to run with a piece of software, that's one indicator
that the piece of software (when standing alone) may not
be derived from the kernel.  I am purposely avoiding the
"but what about when it's linked" argument.
