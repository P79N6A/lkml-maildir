Greg,
     There are a couple variables used throughout relayfs code that could
be modified at any point "simultaneously" by different processes.  These
variables were not declared volatile, thus when we modify them we need to
tell the compiler to refetch from memory as another process could have
changed out from under the current stream of execution since the last time
there were accessed in the function.  An alternative would be to mark the
variables that we care about as volatile.  I am not sure how best to make
that tradeoff (i.e., always forcing a refetch by marking a variable
volatile or only at points were we know we need to by memory clobbering) or
on what side the Linux community comes down on.  We certainly would be
happy to go either way with the relayfs code, i.e., mark them variable and
used the standard atomic operations.  That explains compare_and_store,
atomic_add, and atomic_sub.  It does not explain the memory clobbering
around the atomic set operation, which I'm guessing was there just to be
consistent with the other operations, and could, I believe, be removed.
Hopefully that helps answer the question.  If it doesn't please feel free
to ask more.  Thanks.

Why is this function needed?  What's wrong with the "normal" cmpxchg?

Same here, what's wrong with the normal atomic_set()?
Same question also goes for the other functions like this in this file.
thanks,
