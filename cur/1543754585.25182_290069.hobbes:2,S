It is only because those structures can live outside the driver.
Like skb can live without even any network driver loaded.
Above case is similar, but structure is binded to the module, and can
be 
requested outside the world.
Consider as example network stack:
netdev_wait_allrefs() waits until all references are gone, it is
called  
when device has NETREG_UNREGISTERING state.
Very clean example is virtual devices here(tunnels, vlan) - it is
exactly the same
as logical/superio devices in superio core.
