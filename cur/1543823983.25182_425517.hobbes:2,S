Yes. And it would be good to have a way to turn it off - either globally 
of by some per-process setup (eg off by default, but turn on when doing 
some magic).
The per-process one would be the harder one, because it would require the 
fixmap entry, but not globally. So I suspect the only practical thing 
would be to have it be a kernel boot-time option.
