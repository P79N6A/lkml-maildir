I would have to recommend you try 3.1. I've had issues compiling lots of
stuff with 3.0, until 3.0.4, but still 3.1 has been much better. The
issues were just odd, and I can't really say what fixed them exactly,
but rebuilding problematic programs, with gcc 3.1, made my problems go
away. Usual things were spurious segfaults for no apparent reason. GDB
couldn't even help, not really.
