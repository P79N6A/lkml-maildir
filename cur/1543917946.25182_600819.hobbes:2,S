Ahhh.  That makes sense.  Although it wasn't apparent during my 3-second
perusal of the code.

You're saying it handles hotplug because of stop_machine_run()?

Might as well.  It removed a very small amount of code, and opens the
door a bit for future optimizations in a single place.

Yeah, but before we do that, we need some kind of flag to get the
percpu_counter_mod() fast path shoved into the slow path that takes the
lock.
I'm not sure the stop_machine() mechanism will work very well if we try
to expand this much further for other users.  What would the SGI guys
think if these happened more than once in a blue moon?
