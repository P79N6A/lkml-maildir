OK, this happens now:

Hang on... I just tried it again and it works. I don't think i've got a
termination or SCSI ID conflict, but the following looks wrong:
(scsi0:0:2:0) Synchronous at 5.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 8.
  Vendor: HP        Model: HP35480A          Rev: 1109
  Type:   Sequential-Access                  ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi tape st0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 2, lun 0
  Vendor: HP        Model: C1130A            Rev: 3540
  Type:   Processor                          ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Shouldn't there be a line similar to:
(scsi0:0:2:0) Synchronous at 5.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 8.
but for the scanner?
I'll unplug the scanner and try again. Perhaps it's not internally
terminated like i assumed (but then why does my DAT and the scanner work?)
And it seems that inserting the smbfs module locks everything up completely
but that's not SCSI related.
