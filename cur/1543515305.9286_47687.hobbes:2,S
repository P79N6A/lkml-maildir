I know about those holes and I mentioned them in one of the mails, here is
a quote:

I did dd if=/proc/kcore of=kcore_with_modules.img and it worked fine
including those holes, no GPF. But if what you are saying does represent
real (or potential) danger, we could redesign it using a section per
module.
Here is the latest version of the patch so that everyone can review it and
tell us if it the heuristic used by get_kcore_size() is dangerous or not:
