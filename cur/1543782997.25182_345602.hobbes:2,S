Hi,
OK, it seems, there is enough need for bringing back more control over HPA.
HPA shouldn't be disabled by default and new kernel parameter ("hdx=hpa")
should be added for disabling HPA (yep, people with buggy BIOS-es will
have to add this parameter to their kernel command line, sorry).
If somebody wants to go ahead and submit actual patches...
[s]he is welcomed to.
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
