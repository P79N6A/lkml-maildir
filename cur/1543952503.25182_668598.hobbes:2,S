You're suggesting adding MONTONIC_RAW code to ntp.c ?  That doesn't make
much sense to me (the whole point is its not ntp adjusted). Even if you
mean just inside the "if (clock->xtime_nsec >= (u64)NSEC_PER_SEC ..."
conditional, then that means we don't get to leverage the
cycles_interval, and cycle_last, values, so all of that would have to be
duplicated and managed. Which I'm not sure it would save us much more
then the extra add and compare here.

I disagree. I think that crufts up the clocksource structure (which is
ideally just a simple hw counter abstraction), with timekeeping state.
I'm still not sold on the multiple clocks with multiple notions of time
idea you keep on bringing up. But if/when we cross that bridge, maybe it
would be better to add a timekeeping_clock mid-layer abstraction that
keeps the clocksource specific timekeeping state. That way we don't add
lots of complexity for the clocksource driver writers to deal with and
we allow the clocksources to be better re-purposed (for maybe more sane
things like performance counters) without getting too bloated.

Could you explain this more? 
Given the clocksources have different shift values, why should we not
keep the extra resolution? 
How does adding the extra shifting to convert from the clocksource scale
to the NTP_SCALE_SHIFT value simplify the shifting?
