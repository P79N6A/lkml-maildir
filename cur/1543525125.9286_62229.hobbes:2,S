Don't do that. It will break things HORRIBLY. It would be good if all
drivers just always removed the request while performing it, but they
don't. And making those kinds of changes is much more pervasive than just
making some syntactical changes to use a different kind of list..
It's ok to break drivers if they are easily fixable. It's definitely not
ok to break them in ways that make it very hard to fix up.
