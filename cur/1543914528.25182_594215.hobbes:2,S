I managed to work it all out (it was my fault after all), and I've now
made the changes you suggested to my .configs for 2.6.23-rc1 and
2.6.23-rc6. I've done the benchmarks all over, including tests with
the task bound to a single core. Without further ado, the numbers I
promised:

I've made graphs like last time:

I'll also attach the graphs, as well as my .configs.
As for the data, I really can't read much into it. I think the graphs
tell the story better (if only I could understand the story). Overall
though, a definite improvement over 2.6.23-rc1.
