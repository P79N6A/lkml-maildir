Hello!
I am running Linux-2.4.26-ow2 (OpenWall) without devfs.
And I have seen strange thing in /proc/devices:
--- Begin ---
Character devices:
  1 mem
  2 pty
  3 ttyp
  4 vc/%d  /* *** Here! *** */
  5 tty
  7 vcs
 10 misc
 29 fb
128 ptm
136 pts
162 raw
Block devices:
  3 ide0
 22 ide1
--- End ---
You can see following in drivers/char/console.c in con_init ():
	console_driver.magic = TTY_DRIVER_MAGIC;
	console_driver.name = "vc/%d";
	console_driver.name_base = 1;
	console_driver.major = TTY_MAJOR;
Opposite to this you can see in drivers/char/hvc_console.c in hvc_init ():
	hvc_driver.magic = TTY_DRIVER_MAGIC;
	hvc_driver.driver_name = "hvc";
#ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
	hvc_driver.name = "hvc/%d";
#else
	hvc_driver.name = "hvc";
#endif
	hvc_driver.major = HVC_MAJOR;
So should console_driver.name assignment be surrounded
with #ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS? And is its name "vc"?
And do you need to assign console_driver.driver_name?
Thank you!
