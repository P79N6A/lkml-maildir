I bet, with a minor hack, it can help you *find* those problem areas too.  
You compile the two patches together and automatically log any event along 
with the execution address, where your explicit schedule points failed to 
reschedule in time.  Sort of like a profile but suited exactly to your 
problem.
This just detects the problem areas in normal kernel execution, not 
spinlocks, but that is probably where most of the maintainance will be anyway.
By the way, did you check for latency in directory operations?

Heh, subtle.  Thanks for pointing that out and making my head hurt.
