For a propely configured kernel you can use 'make kernelrelease' which
will give you the same as UTS_RELEASE.
To get kernel version alone you can use 'make kernelversion'.
In a source file to be backward compatible you can use:
#include <linux/version.h>
#ifndef UTS_RELEASE
#include <linux/uts_release.h>
#endif
But in general using UTS_RELEASE in source is almost a sign of something
wrong.
For a module the UTS_RELEASE is retreiveable with modinfo.

And likewise. Address me directly next time with cc: to lkml. I may miss
lkml mails.
