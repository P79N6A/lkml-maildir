I've put up 2.2.0pre7ac5 on
	
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.2pre/...
Differences between 2.2.0pre7ac4 and 2.2.0pre7ac5
o	Backed out the routing change - doesnt work and ANK dislikes it
o	Scheduling info fix
o	Re-order PCI probes to match 2.0.x more - this stops the ne2kpci and
	tulip cards changing ethN order between 2.0 and 2.2
o	Restored the multi-lun ide-scsi stuff. Sure it breaks the 1 in
	50,000 cases of people with multilun but it stops the tons of other
	cases where it crashes the machine.
o	More typo fixes
o	AIC7xxx defaults to tagged queue off
o	Remove IBM drive from blacklist
p	Page cache hash is now scaled by memory size
o	select()/poll() work for arbitary sized maps.
o	Everything doing version checks now uses version.h - fixes the
	compile	problems with the bttv driver.
o	3c523 fixes (I hope)
o	Next step in the xconfig saga.
o	Cleaned up ipconfig ifdefs a little and fixed a small info bug in
	it.
o	Cleaned up KMOD ifdefs
o	Testing ANK's smp race fixes for networking

	some other sort died instead

o	Large fd arrays (100,000 per process!)
o	Console font handling fixes in 512 char mode

o	Problems with certain numbers of disks fixed
o	PAS2 and SB sound fixes
o	Swap/page size header stuff handled right
o	NFS client knows about BSD style FIFO rule
