Actually, the point _is_ to break everything. 
The fact that there are wrappers emulating old PCI behavior is the reason 
the SCSI drivers don't use the 2.4 interface. If we provide wrappers for 
alloc_consistent, they'll never change those, either. 
At some point, you have to bite the bullet and break the API. It'll be 
the only way to get drivers to convert. The statement was more of "When we 
do this, it'll be painful" rather than "If we do it..." :)
