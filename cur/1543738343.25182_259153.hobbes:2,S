Oh, I also remember at one point toying with moving some devices to
different parents based on weird mobo design, but I dropped the idea.

Oh, I'm thinking about inserting a "platform" entry between some USB
controllers and the PCI parent. On PowerMac, some of these USB controllers
are power managed via special stuffs in Apple ASICs that aren't directly
related to the PCI bus they sit on. Right now, I have hacks in the USB
HCD drivers themselves for that, but it would be cleaner just to "insert"
an entry in the power tree to do the job.
