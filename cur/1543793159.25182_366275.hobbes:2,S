Sounds like a "singing capacitor".  Check the LKML archives.
It's fundamentally a hardware problem caused by vendor greed which leads
them to cheap out on components, compounded by only testing on Windows
which has a dynamic timer tick.
This can often be worked around by setting HZ=100 but you'll take a
performance and timing granularity hit.
