But when I diasbled it in kernel + recompile and reboot the machine my harddrives make hard seeks and fancy noises also I get APIC error on CPU0 without any hints or oops and few minutes later after using the machine it freezes the harddisk (maybe power off,I noticed it on reset that the disks power on with SATA support it does not appear). If the SATA driver under SCSI is turned on no problems.
How are you disabling the SATA drive?  BIOS?  Kernel configuration?
