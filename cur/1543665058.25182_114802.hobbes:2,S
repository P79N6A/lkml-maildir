Gee, here is somebody who knows about thread APIs and ABIs.  You're
really embarrassing yourself.

Whether you like it or not, people are using threads.  TLS requires a
thread register even in single-threaded applications.  The mechanism I
proposed would use segments if <4GB addresses can be allocated,
otherwise fall back to prctl(ARCH_SET_FS).  This is about as good as you
can get it.
Remove anything and hammer is the only architecture without good thread
support which undoubtedly makes you happy but almost nobody else.
