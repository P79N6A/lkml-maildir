Subject: CONFIG_CRC32 in 2.4.22 breaks PCMCIA

CONFIG_CRC32 was introduced in 2.4.22.  I found that if I didn't
explicitly set it, the pcnet_cs driver from stand-alone PCMCIA
distribution didn't work.  PCMCIA relies on the crc functions, and
since they were always available before 2.4.22, it doesn't check for
them.
This seems to be significant breakage, and it took me a good while
to figure out what was going on.  Is this change reasonable in the
stable kernel series?
