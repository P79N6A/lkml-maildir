Well it's obviously better than duplicating the thing.
There are other common things which can be hoisted to linux/io.h, but if we
do that then zillions of .c files need to be changed to include linux/io.h
rather than asm/io.h.  That's a good janitorial thing to do, but I doubt if
you want to do it ;)
