CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO ?
This doesn't solve the problem with missing pci_alloc_consistent(),
furthermore I *have* FIFO (ECP) so I would hate to disable it just to
workaround for missing DMA.
If pci_alloc_consistent is supposed to exist on all architectures
regardless whether they have PCI or DMA, no problem - I have already
done some dummy implementation.
