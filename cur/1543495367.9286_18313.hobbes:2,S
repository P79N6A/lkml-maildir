ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...) will succeed for kernel tasks
(e.g. kswapd) if you are root.  Subsequent operations fail, but this
appears to be an accident.
Suggestion: clear current->dumpable for kflushd/kpiod/kswapd, so that
PTRACE_ATTACH will fail.  Some of the drivers (md, usb, etc.) could
use the same treatment.
It might be sensible to do this for init as well; then the special
case for pid=1 can be removed from sys_ptrace().  OTOH, you might want
the core dump if init crashed.
