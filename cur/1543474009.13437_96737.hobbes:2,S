    This isn't kernel related (or maybe it is, depending on what kernel
    bits you're trying to interface to) but unless those distributions
    all use *exactly* the same libc that assumption won't hold.

    Well, that would work pretty well for the distributions that use
    glibc, if library location was all you worried about.  If location
    of binaries was important, then the vendor becomes useful again; but
    ia32-glibc2.07-redhat5.2-linux starts becoming a fairly long
    typename.  A `ia32-glibc2-linux' type tells very very little, except
    that this package was probably linked against glibc.
