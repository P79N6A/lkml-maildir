Thanks, worked better. Got an oops with ohci-hcd or ehci-hcd, though. 
shutdown worked after rmmoding these.
However resume did not - got:
dn: cn= pmdisk: CPUs: 544501616
 pmdisk: Image: 168453230 Pages
 pmdisk: Pagedir: 975201134 Pages
pmdisk: Resume mismatch: kernel version
pmdisk: Error -1 resuming
PM: Resume from disk failed.
of course, this was the same kernel. Don't really know what to try next,
but it doesn't matter that much to me, don't lose your time with it if 
you lack time :)
