Yes, that's a very astute observation about PCI.  But we will still
have the hard ones left, like the initcalls which want to be called
before SMP, or two-sided registration mechanisms (anything which has
registration of servers and clients) still requires ordering.

The best thing about the explicit initcalls is that they document
everything they are relying on, so they can be replaced.  At the
moment it's very hard to see how to replace an initcall (does it rely
on link order for example).
I don't think we can complete the conversion before 2.6, so I think we
need both.  If explicit core initcalls become v. rare, great!
Rusty.
