I see no reason for denying this.  This patch should fix it:
i386: PTRACE_POKEUSR: allow changing RF bit in EFLAGS register.
Setting RF (resume flag) allows a debugger to resume execution
after a code breakpoint without tripping the breakpoint again.
It is reset by the CPU after execution of one instruction.
