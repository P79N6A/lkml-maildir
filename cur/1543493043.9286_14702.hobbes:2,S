You actually probably don't need to tune them

For 2Gig of RAM you want to recompile as per the directions in the
kernel tree (include/asm-i386/page.h) to use an offset of 0x80000000.

It will do for an http/1.0 test, it doesn't for real world. You can tell
if its a factor because you will see much less than 100% CPU usage and
that adding clients increases performance.

Yes

There is nothing there you need to touch

You shouldnt need to touch those either.

Apache does fine with the default CPU affinity. You probably need to tune
the apache configuration more than anything else.  You want the logging and
swap on a different disk to the pages and to the system preferably. For the
raid you want striping (obviously) and the raid howto/tools tell you how
to find the optimal stripe size.
If you want to answer the question "how fast is linux as a web server" 
consider benchmarking using Zeus (www.zeus.co.uk) too.
