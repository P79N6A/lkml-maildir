What you are saying is that there is a lot of timers timing out at the 
same time. When that happens you will get them all executed at priority 
99 with the simple setup. In the current design you get them executed in 
order of priority and the task lowers it's priority as it goes along.
If you have a long list of low priority callbacks pending to be executed 
the running one will finish at priority 99 and then the high priority one 
will be put in as the list on the list.
Ok, I see your point: Although you can't preempt the individual callbacks 
you can preempt the loop, which helps on latencies as many timers can 
timeout before they are executed.

I think the simplest solution would be to add
         if (p->blocked_on)
                 wake_up_process(p);
in __setscheduler().
