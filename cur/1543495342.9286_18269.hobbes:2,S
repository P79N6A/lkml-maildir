Err, I'm sorry to tell you that you've misread his posting. He had
problems doing a "make zImage". This is because zImage has a limit of 640k
for the kernel, AFAIK. His kernel was over 648k! If he had used "make
bzImage", he would have had the ability to build a kernel up to 16MB in
size.
It goes without saying you'd better have a bootloader with the ability to
load bzImages (LILO release 20 or better).
Cheers,
Alex
