This solved the last outstanding problem with the 4th drive and the
driver seems to find all drives and properly boot off them, at least
in a situation where no RAID-functionalty of the card is used. Great
Work.
# A first quick run of bonnie++ seems to show 2.6.0-test9+libata several
# %s slower then 2.4.22+ft3xx, but that might be related to differences
# between 2.4 and 2.6.
