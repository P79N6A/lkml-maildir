hi,
I'm running RH 7.1.94 (roswell) and kernel 2.4.7-2
Every time I boot I get this in my /var/log/messages:
Oct 14 12:18:16 saintpc kernel: IRQ routing conflict for 00:07.2, have irq 5, 
want irq 9
00:07.2 is my USB controller, which I don't use currently, and IRQ 9 is my 
soundcard, which is working fine...
Can something be done about this? Or is this not a 'bad' message?
Thanks in advance
Hans Schippers
