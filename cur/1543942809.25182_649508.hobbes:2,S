Subject: [PATCH 10/16] dlm: make find_rsb() fail gracefully when namelen is too large
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/7/21

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>
We *can* get there from receive_request() and dlm_recover_master_copy()
with namelen too large if incoming request is invalid; BUG() from
DLM_ASSERT() in allocate_rsb() is a bit excessive reaction to that
and in case of dlm_recover_master_copy() we would actually oops before
that while calculating hash of up to 64Kb worth of data - with data
actually being 64 _bytes_ in kmalloc()'ed struct.
