I've picked it up for x86.git and i'll keep testing it (the patches seem 
straightforward) and will report any problems with the bite-head-off 
option unset.
[ The 32-bit NUMA compile issue is orthogonal to these patches - it's 
  due to the lack of 32-bit NUMA support in your changes :) That needs 
  fixing before this could go into v2.6.25. ]
