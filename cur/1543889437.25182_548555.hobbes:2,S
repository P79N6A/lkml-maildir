when constructing debug output it's a good idea to make it as 
'context-free' as possible. I.e. instead of saying 'Filler' and 
explaining it somewhere in Documentation/*, just say:
  Expected memory values at 0xc90f6d50:  5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a
  ... but found the following values:    12 34 56 78 90 12 34 56
(or whatever it means)
please also put in one of the keywords as the first word of whatever 
SLUB prints:
   BUG: ...
   WARNING: ...
   INFO: ...
the output should be compact, but never at the price of 
understandability. For example i tried to make lockdep output as 
self-explanatory as possible - and a good portion of lockdep.c is about 
having around the kind of information to make the error more 
understandable (tracking lock-acquire stacktraces, tracking 
initialization points, tracking initialization-time symbol names, etc.), 
and there's even quite some algorithmic complexity from that. I probably 
spent more time on making lockdep output easier to decode than on any 
other sub-feature of lockdep. The output format literally went over 
hundreds of revisions. Output to humans is _the_ most important thing 
that a debug facility can do, sometimes more important than the 
debugging it offers ;-) And even the existing lockdep output sometimes 
confuses people.
