I know about that, but I tried with other cable and the trouble leaves the
same. On the other hand, before kernel 2.4.2 I think, (not sure of the number)
the kernel does not want to activate UDMA on startup even with the option
activated, and this on via mb. At that time, I used to force the DMA with
hdparm, and I had no troubles in dma mode 3 with that hard disk, and I can
remeber that udma mode 4 was even not indicate when I try hdparm -I /dev/hdc,
so I don't know why it detects dma 4, and I did not manage to change that at
boot time. 
Another example is the hda, which is an ibm DTLA hard drive. In 2.4.2 a 2.4.3
he made the same error in udma mode4, and since 2.4.4 no troubles anymore... I
find it difficult to believe that it is hardware trouble!
Furthemore, I began this thread because I heard someone else on this mailing
list with the same crc error and I thought the patch in ac4 was in a way to
solve the dma detect fails.
	thanks for your help
