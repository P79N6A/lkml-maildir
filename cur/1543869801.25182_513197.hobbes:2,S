This is how I handle a read (write/accept/connect, same thing) inside 
coronet (coroutine+epoll async library - 
http://www.xmailserver.org/coronet-lib.html
 ).
static int conet_read_ll(struct sk_conn *conn, char *buf, int nbyte) {
        int n;
        
        while ((n = read(conn->sfd, buf, nbyte)) < 0) {
                if (errno == EINTR)
                        continue;
                if (errno != EAGAIN && errno != EWOULDBLOCK)
                        return -1;
                if (!(conn->events & EPOLLIN)) {
                        conn->events = EPOLLIN;
                        if (conet_mod_conn(conn, conn->events) < 0)
                                return -1;
                }
                if (conet_yield(conn) < 0)
                        return -1;
        }
                        
        return n;
}
I use EPOLLET and, you don't change the interest set until you actually 
get an EAGAIN. *Many* read/write mode changes in the usage will simply 
happen w/out an epoll_ctl() needed. The conet_mod_conn() function does the 
actual epoll_ctl() and add EPOLLET to the specified event set. The 
conet_yield() function end up calling the libpcl's co_resume(), that is 
basically a switch-to-next-coroutine-until-fd-becomes-ready (maps 
directly to a swapcontext).
That cuts 50+% of the epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD).
