More data from news.com.
Dell has 19% of the server market with $531M/quarter in sales[1] over
212,750 machines per quarter[2].
That means that the average sale price for a server from Dell was $2495.
The average sale price of all servers from all companies is $9347.
I still don't see the big profits touted by the scaling fanatics, anyone
care to explain it?
