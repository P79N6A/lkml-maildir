I don't really like how this stuff got arranged either.

AFAICT its only usages are in /proc/ reporting and loadavg calculation,
which aren't hotpaths per-se, but shouldn't explode in complexity.
Similar things could be said for nr_uninterruptible() and nr_iowait(),
but some kind of unusual constraint is involved wrt. hotplug.
