Adding linux-kernel to Cc: list, as I'm sure Linus wants to hear from
all maintainers, not just those that hang out on the linux-ia64 list.

I can't quite see how to manage multiple "heads" in git.  I notice that in
your tree on kernel.org that .git/HEAD is a symlink to heads/master ...
perhaps that is a clue.
I'd like to have at least two, or perhaps even three "HEADS" active in my
tree at all times.  One would correspond to my old "release" tree ... pointing
to changes that I think are ready to go into the Linus tree.  A second would
be the "testing" tree ... ready for Andrew to pull into "-mm", but not ready
for the base. The third (which might only exist in my local tree) would be
for changes that I'm playing around with.
I can see how git can easily do this ... but I don't know how to set up my
public tree so that you and Andrew can pull from the right HEAD.
