This is expected behaviour.  This is the defined Unix semantics.  Unix
provides an API which allows the application to request data
synchronisation with the disk if it wants it --- the semantics
explicitly do not guarantee this unless you use fsync/fdatasync or
O_SYNC/O_DSYNC.

Of course it is true journaling.  It just has different semantics to a
system which journals data synchronously.

That is the whole point, tho.  fsck elimination is precisely why most
Unix journaling filesystems were written.

Huh?
