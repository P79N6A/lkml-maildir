It seems to blow up when I'm doing something which probably wants lots
of memory, ie running X and opening up several mozilla windows (though
it still crashes while just running X, Enlightenment, and w3m in an
Eterm...but it does take a little longer, though still < 30 min.).
I went back to 2.2.18 and the crashing stopped.  I am using UDMA66 on
one of my drives, no DMA on the other two.
I haven't tried a non-Athlon optimised kernel, nor one with as few
options as possible; hopefully I will get the chance to do this soon.
