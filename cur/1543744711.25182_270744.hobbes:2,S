I'm trying your kernel linux-2.6.9-ac8 because I have an ITERAID IT8212
controller intergrated in my motherboard.
I set up an array of two 80GB disks in RAID 1.
I get a common error, but I can't get out from it.
The error is a stupid:
"VFS: Cannot open root device "301" or unknown-block(3,1)
Please append..."
Boot messages show (for what I can see in my monitor)
IT8212: IDE controller at CPI slot 0000:01:0c.0
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:01:0c.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level,high) -> IRQ 17
IT8212: 100% native mode on irq 17
	ide0: BM-DMA at 0xb400-0xb407, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
it8212: controller in smart mode.
	ide1: BM-DMA at 0xb408-0xb40f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd,pio
hda: Integrated Technology Express Inc, ATA DISK drive
hda: IT8212 RAID 1 volume
Using anticipatory io scheduler
ide0 at 0xa410-0xa417,0xa802 on irq 17
...
[something about mice,NET,ACPI]
...
VFS: ["the error above"]
I can't boot the kernel neither from a disk in the array, neither from a
disk attached to the first two channel of the motherboard (which are
typical controller IDE)
I tried with boot option:
root=/dev/hda1
root=/dev/hdc1
root=/dev/sda1
and with devfs=nomount
I boot with initrd.
I attach my .config
Where is my fault ?
Sorry to bother you for such a stupid problem, but even google can't
find the answer.
TIA
P.S: Do you think that this driver will be put in 2.6.10 ?
