Isn't the right fix just to remove rlim_rss and this RLIMIT_RSS code
from here?  It's pretty silly for madvise alone to be taking notice
of it.  Presumably the code crept in by mistake from some tree which
was using an RLIMIT_RSS patch on 2.4.

Rik had a patch implementing RLIMIT_RSS in 2.6-mm for a while.
But I think there were a couple of problems with it, and no great
demand for the feature, so Andrew dropped it until someone makes
a better case for it.
