Hi folks,
I've got a problem with my brand new DVD drive (Pioneer DVD 303S): 
Immediately after mounting a CDROM I can access all files as usual. 
After a few minutes idle time the drive stops rotating. Now, when I 
access the CD, the drive does NOT immediately spin up. Instead, I 
get the following messages in /var/log/kern.log after a about 30 
seconds:
Dec 10 18:37:33 bilbo kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 4538, scsi0, channel 0, id 2, lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 00 00 9b 00 00 0f 00

Dec 10 18:38:07 bilbo kernel: sr0: CD-ROM not ready.  Make sure you have a disc in the drive.

Of course I cannot access the files I expected.
This happens with 2.2.13 as well as with 2.2.14-pre10. I will try 
the latest 2.2.x kernel now, but I am not very optimistic in this 
case.
Any ideas? Your help would be highly appreciated.
Regards
Harri
