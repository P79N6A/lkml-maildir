OFFSET(i) is defined as 4*(i), so they don't actually overlap. 
(Arguably that macro should go away.)

SHA-1 fundamentally wants to work with 32-bit quantities.  It might be 
possible to use quad operations for some things, with sufficient 
cleverness, but I doubt it'd be worth the effort.

That seems to be the consensus.  I'll see if I can find some time to try 
linux@horizon.com's suggestion and report back.
I don't think, though, that cache footprint is the *only* thing that 
matters.  Leaving aside /dev/urandom, there are cases where throughput 
matters a lot.  This patch set came out of some work on a hashing block 
device driver in which SHA is, by far, the biggest CPU user.  One could 
imagine content-addressable filesystems, or even IPsec under the right 
workloads, being in a similar situation.
Would it be more palatable to roll the patch as an optimized CryptoAPI 
module rather than as a lib/sha1.c replacement?  That wouldn't help 
/dev/urandom, of course, but for other cases it would allow the user to 
ask for the optimized version if needed, and not pay the footprint costs 
otherwise.
