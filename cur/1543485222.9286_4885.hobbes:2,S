I noticed some weird behavior last night.  I was dialed into the
office from home.  I was uploading some files via ftp.  The modem send
light started off blinking rapidly (basically flickering) indicating
high traffic.  Then it suddenly backed off, maybe sending about 1
packet/second.  It stayed like this for maybe 30-60 seconds & then
sped up again, but not to as fast as it was initially.  Final
throughput was a little on the low side.
Details:
I'm running 2.2.0pre9 at home.  I was dialed into the office via pppd,
connecting to a linux box running a 2.0.3x kernel.  I was uploading
to another linux box (2.0.29 kernel), which is on the same ethernet as
the box hosting the modems.
