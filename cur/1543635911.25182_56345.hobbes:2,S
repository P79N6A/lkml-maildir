With ext3 and the htree directory indexing, a 500MHz PIII does
it in 57 seconds.

Nope. ext3 and ext2 directories use the traditional first-fit
search-from-start for directories.  So adding 200k files to
a single directory is pathological.

Apply 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.25/ext3-htree.patch
to your 2.5.25 tree, mount with `-o index' and enjoy watching ext3 eat
Solaris and FreeBSD's lunch.
htree isn't quite ready yet and development seems a little moribund.
It'd be nice to get it finished off.
