I think there's problem in both the kernel and in X. Why?
Work machine:
	* test9-pre2 w/ X 4.0d ... uptime 5 days nothing reporting
	shm errors like my other boxes. This machine gets hit pretty
	hard when I'm on it.
Co-worker's machine:
	* 2.2.16 w/ X 4.0.1c ... getting reports of shm errors but no
	lockups. This guy tortures his machine.
Home machine:
	* test7 w/ X 4.0.1c ... getting reports of shm errors but no
	lockups
	* test9-pre* w/ X 4.0.1c ... can't stay up for more than a
	couple hours before locking up.
	To do:
		* Try test 8
		* Try X from about a week or two ago (or futher back if needed)
Not very scientific I know. But so far the thing I see in common is that
using kernels before test9-pre* with or without X 4.0.1c and your
machine wont lock up in a relatively short period of time. use
test9-pre* w/ X 4.0.1c and you're not gonna be up for more than a couple
hours. i may be lumping all the test9-pre versions in here when I
shouldnt be.
Like someone stated earlier, I think this is like the truncate bug.
Something has been changed that just brought this bug out to the front.
