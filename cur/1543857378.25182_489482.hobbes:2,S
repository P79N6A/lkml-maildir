The same can be done using the virtual->physical mappings that exist on 
many platforms for the kernel address space (ia64 dynamically calculates 
those, x86_64 uses a page table with 2M pages for mapping the kernel). The 
problem is that the 1-1 mapping between physical and virtual addresses 
will have to be (at least partially) sacrificed which may lead to 
complications with DMA devices.
