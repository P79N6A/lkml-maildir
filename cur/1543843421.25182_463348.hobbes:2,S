primarily because i fail to see any property of static tracers that are 
not met by dynamic tracers. So to me dynamic tracers like SystemTap are 
a superset of static tracers.
So my position is that what we should concentrate on is to make the life 
of dynamic tracers easier (be that a handful of generic, parametric 
hooks that gather debuginfo information and add NOPs for easy patching), 
while realizing that static tracers have no advantage over dynamic 
tracers.
i.e. why add infrastructure for the sake of something that is clearly 
inferior? I have no problem with adding infrastructure for SystemTap, 
but i am asking the question: is it worth adding a static tracer?
I would of course accept static tracers too if someone proved it that 
they offer something that dynamic tracers cannot do.
(Just like i would accept the reintroduction of the Big Kernel Lock too, 
if someone proved it that it's the right thing to do.)
