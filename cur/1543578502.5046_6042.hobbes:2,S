Now that 2.4 is out, it will probably be a few .x releases until 2.5
begins.
A discussion on Named Streams and Extended Attributes was put off until
2.5 earlier in the 2.4 development cycle. For compatibility with
existing, widely-deployed filesystems (e.g., NFS, XFS, BeFS, HFS, etc.),
Linux needs a standard way to expose and interact with these filesystem
features. A draft of a paper proposing a methd for accomplishing this on
Posix systems is available at:

Please read and comment! :)
