verify_area on most archs (486+, ...) catches e.g. pipe (0xff000000), but
does not catch pipe (0) nor pipe (0x40000000) (provided those addresses are
not mapped); so that you know that an address is valid for write, you must
do both verify_area and __put_user/__copy_to_user, not only one of these
(put_user/copy_to_user do both).
