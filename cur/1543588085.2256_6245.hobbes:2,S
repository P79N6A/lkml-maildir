If you add one line you can make it part of the CONFIG_ name space. That is
why it uses CONFIG_. CONFIG_ is a valuable debugging tool too. You also can't
reliably deduce a symbol is dead if its only in source because the source code
may be building for 2.0/2.2/2.4 and the symbol may be relevant only in some
cases. It isnt that simple.
Its a valuable list, but it simply isnt going to be possible to do much by
hand validate.
