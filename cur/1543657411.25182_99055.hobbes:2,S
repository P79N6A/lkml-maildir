Well, that is the problem - trying to figure out what the tab size of 
the author was.  It gets messy really quickly when a file was edited by 
multiple authors, using multiple tab widths. It then becomes impossible 
to figure out how to set the tab width to make the code indent properly.
Anyhoo, over the years, I learned not to care about it, since it is just 
too trivial an issue and there are more important things to worry about.
So, if I find a page's indentation bothersome, I run it through 'indent' 
for a private readable copy.  I even ported 'indent' to windoze a couple 
of years ago...
