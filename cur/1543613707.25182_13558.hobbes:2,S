Subject: dd of=blkdev seek=123 -> EINVAL ??

With recent dd and 2.4.17rc1 an attempt to write (with DD)
into a block-device yields  EINVAL error.
Doing   strace   shows that it comes from   ftruncate64()
on the opened device.
Should there be some other error code ?   EBLKDEV ?
Or is the dd (4.0p) at fault, and it should either
not ask for the ftruncate*() at all, or ignore its error ?
