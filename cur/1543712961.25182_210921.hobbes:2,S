I WAS cross-compiling, but the problem persists when compiling 
natively. I don't net-boot but load the image from a HFS+ partition. I 
can't boot
http://membres.lycos.fr/schaffner/vmlinux.orig
which is a compilation of linux-2.6.4 with
http://membres.lycos.fr/schaffner/.config
I can, however, boot
http://membres.lycos.fr/schaffner/vmlinux.patched
which is the same after the following patch:
http://membres.lycos.fr/schaffner/boot-of-works.patch
Maybe the problem is specific to the model of the machine?
Thanks,
Martin
