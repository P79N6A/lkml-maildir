My /etc/mtab is symlinked to /proc/mounts and have these entries:
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1 / ext2 ro 0 0
/dev/sda2 /.share ext2 rw 0 0
...
Also fsck does not work for my second mountpoint if specified
as a relative path:
pegasus:/#fsck .share    <--- relative path
Parallelizing fsck version 1.23 (15-Aug-2001)
No devices specified to be checked!
pegasus:/#fsck /.share    <--- absolute path
Parallelizing fsck version 1.23 (15-Aug-2001)
e2fsck 1.23, 15-Aug-2001 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
/dev/sda2 is mounted.
WARNING! Running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem...
Looks like running "fsck <mountpoint>" is uncommon
and isn't tested much.
