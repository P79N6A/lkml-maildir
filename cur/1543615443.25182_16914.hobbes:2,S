While we're at it, can we extend this model to also include details about 
the other filesystem data structures with (potential) private info, i.e.
struct dentry and struct file? ext2 might not use them, but other 
filesystems certainly do.

Minor issue of coding style. I'd steer away from such gratuitious changes, 
especially since they divert from the commonly accepted practice of having 
no spaces between the name of the function and its arguments.
