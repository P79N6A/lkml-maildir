If you take the Wikipedia definition of Tivoization, you'll see it's
about copyleft software only, and no law mandates the use of copyleft
software.  There's no end to bad laws, but a law that mandated the use
of copyleft (=> free) software and at the same time prohibited
modifications by the user would be a very contradictory one.
