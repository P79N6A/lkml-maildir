Hello there.
I got a little problem here, i'm using debian sarge with an own compiled
kernel. The kernel version is 2.6.13-mm3 . No any extra patches.
I got strange errors in my dmesg:
KERNEL: assertion ((int)tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) >= 0) failed at
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (1129)
KERNEL: assertion ((int)tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) >= 0) failed at
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (1129)
Leak s=1 1
Leak s=2 3
KERNEL: assertion ((int)tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) >= 0) failed at
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (1129)
Leak s=1 1
KERNEL: assertion ((int)tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) >= 0) failed at
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (1129)
KERNEL: assertion ((int)tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) >= 0) failed at
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c (1129)
^^ like those. I don't know what is that or what cause that.
And i got segfaults at random time. (4hours.. after 6hours.. after
1hour..) I think those error messages causes the segfault in my kernel.
See this (shot from kernel-panic message) :

And i uploaded my config.gz to here:

So please, anyone got any idea about that ? :)
udv / greetings,
VMiklos
