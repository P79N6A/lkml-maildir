Hi!
If works for me, modulo graphics problems. So if it is broken on your
machine, try finding driver that is responsible.
Graphics problems: for some reason, swsusp now eats cursor
(radeonfb)... or is it softcursor breakage? There are more problems in
framebuffer, something seems to be very wrong in palete handling. (I
set green palete by default. mutt likes to reset terminal in such way
that font goes white; with -rc2 it affects even non-current console).
