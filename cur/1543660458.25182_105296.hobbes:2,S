I have Win2k and XP machines and I've had many symptoms of a broken 
TCP/IP stack in my TCP programming on those platforms.  I communicate 
with Linux 2.2.19 and 2.2.21 machines running tcpserver _a lot_ from 
these, and I have to do a number of strange things to make it all work. 
 I don't know if my layer-4 problems would help, but if they would, I 
could try and describe them for you.
