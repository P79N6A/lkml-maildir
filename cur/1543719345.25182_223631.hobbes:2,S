By what magic system can know that you are going to do ls again
in 2 minutes?
Does is happen if you do ls several times in a row (to make needed pages
not-once-used), then wait a bit and do ls again?

cp should use fadvise() and say that it _really_ does not need those pages.

Easier said than done... Why 200MB and not 400? etc...

If you think you see VM misbehavior,
1) verify that it is indeed MISbehaving
2) produce useful bug report
3) report it and track it until fixed
Apps take ages to start after cache being trashed because they are bloated.
Fight bloat. Join uclibc/dietlibc/etc efforts.
Random example: why on earth ntpd daemon have RSS of ~1.5 Mb???!
