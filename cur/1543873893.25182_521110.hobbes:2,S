Erm, OK, this applies after previous patch if it's wanted.
After Randy spotted an errant TAB, this is a cleanup of
arch/x86_64/Kconfig.
1) clean up all the trailing whitespace,
2) make sure we use tabs instead of spaces,
3) ensure all help messages use tab & two spaces,
4) make sure all help messages are < 80 cols.
