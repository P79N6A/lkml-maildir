Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Maple bus support for the Sega Dreamcast - consequential change to pvr2 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/9/74

Make the VBLANK interrupt shareable.
This is the third time I have posted this patch. This is required to
allow the Maple bus driver to work (Maple hardware is synced with the
VBLANK interrupt).
