Well they'll even use the free version, use it for a dummy project with some
anonymous email address for the open logging requirement, and won't tell
anyone about it.  We need to be realistic here this is common practice in 
the industry even if no one will admit it.
Maybe we should add an additional restriction to the Linux kernel license 
saying that Microsoft has no right to use Linux since they're making a 
competitor product.  Let's see if that changes anything.
