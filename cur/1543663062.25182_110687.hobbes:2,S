           Summary: M5451 (OSS trident.c) did not come out of reset
    Kernel Version: 2.5.62
            Status: NEW
          Severity: low
             Owner: mulix@mulix.org
         Submitter: mulix@mulix.org
Last time I booted 2.5, I noticed that my sound card no longer
works. The card is:
00:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi]
M5451 PCI AC-Link Controller Audio Device (rev 01)
And the computer is a thinkpad R30. It turns out that this patch, from
Alan Cox on 01/11/2002, broke it for me, by failing ali_reset_5451 if
the card doesn't come out of reset:
# --------------------------------------------
# 02/11/01      alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk        1.786.161.45
# [PATCH] some trident needs longer delays to power up codecs
# --------------------------------------------
The 2.4 behaviour is to continue as usual even if the card doesn't
come out of reset, because it's a non fatal error on at least some
cards. This patch reverts the behaviour to the 2.4 behaviour, which
works for me. If anyone knows how to tell for a given card whether
this is a fatal error or not, please let me know and I'll update the
patch.
