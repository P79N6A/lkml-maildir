Greg,
I almost started doing what you just said but then I realized that none of
the programs will "just work" because all of them will look into /sys/bus/i2c
instead of /sys/bus/platform/i8k.
For userspace tools to work transparently we would need something like
/sys/class/sensor/{fan|temp|current}, but it is something I am not ready to do
now - I need to finish input layer first.
So given above I think having private scheme for now is ok. Sooo... Can I get
my attributes goups patch in so I can use it in i8k, please?
Thanks!
