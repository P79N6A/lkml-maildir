Sure, but one can do better than quake.  The server can have
a look at the "terrain" at startup, and divide it into a
bunch of regions and calculate which regions cannot
bee seen from each other.  You can then do
fast simplified visibility calculation on the server,
by looking up positions in a lookup table. Players
in tunnels and such isn't visible from most of the
level so such structures would then provide the
desired surprises - even for cheaters.
Also, one can use a representation that makes it hard for
an AI to guess what is "wall" and what is a "player".
The players could be polygons just like everything else,
and a good level would have more moving items than
players so movement detection won't be a good
heuristic either.
