OK, please what do I need to do?  I did build with debug, but dmesg 
gets filled up so fast I have lost the logs.  Also, when I do use the 
new 8139too.c driver, the box (my gateway) is unusable for any type 
of network traffic load.
So I will need to do it in one hit to grab the info and switch back 
again.
Thanks for reply - I want to help and reolve this too...
Nick
