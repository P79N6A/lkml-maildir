Not really since model 6, 7 and 8/[7:0] share the same way, only the
model 8 (K6-2) steppings 8..15 (heard about "CTX" core or something) is
different since it allows for more detailed configuration.

Yes, the stepping is different. However, the CPU ID string need not
necessarily change, that's true.

Check my other mail on the list regarding K6-2 misdetection and
stepping fix for ideas.
