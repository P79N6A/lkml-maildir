Everything appeared to be going just fine until I encountered the now
famous:
undefined symbol: __bzero
My initial guess was that it was because I was running libc6 2.0.7, not
libc6 2.0.7pre6.  Well, that led to me trying to build glibc, which required
add-ons for LinuxThreads, Locale, Crypt ...
That's when I figured it might be best if I just asked the group for help,
and tried again for a clean RH 5.1/5.2 distribution.
I think that if I knew how to avoid the "undefined symbol: __bzero" problem,
then all would be well.  My really big problem now is that I get that
message if I try to do a make.  I get:
make: error in loading shared libraries
undefined symbol: __bzero
Thanks again.

		Im running 5.1 and 5.2 with 2.2.1 kernels. What problem did
you hit. I'd like
		to add it to clue point 2 if there is a nasty trap.
