After looking at kdev_t and existing code some more, I think that it
should be an unsigned long.  Reasons:
* making kdev_t a struct, or a pointer to a struct, complicates
assignment of kdev_t values
* tons of existing code stores a device number in a 32-bit var, and
passes this value into to_kdev_t() inline function
* making kdev_t an unsigned long allows growth and 32-bit major/minor
numbers on 64-bit platforms
I experimented a bit with kdev_t.h patches and found that a 32-bit
kdev_t was quite easy to add, and very compatible with existing code.
The main problem was boot loaders, such as the kernel boot sector which
uses a word (16-bit) to store the root device major/minor number.  I
overcame this by defining kdev_t conversions which supported various
sizes of kdev_t values:
	u16_to_kdev_t() converts 8-bit major/minor to 16-bit
	u32_to_kdev_t() converts 16-bit major/minor to 32-bit on AXP, IA64
	u64_to_kdev_t() converts 32-bit major/minor to 16-bit on IA32
This solution keeps most of userland, such as LILO, binary compatible. 
mknod, ls, and such will of course have to be recompiled.
