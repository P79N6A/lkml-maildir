Yes it is.  But I didn't think of a better one.

The problem is the numbers are inconsistent between user interfaces already.
RT priorities are [0, 99], nice vaules are [-20, 19].  Perhaps it'd be
simpler to break it down to just three values for the rlimit.
0: Same as now, raise nice value only.
1: Can lower nice value.
2: Can set RT policy (this includes any priority [1, 99], or optionally
max out at something lower than 99, reserving full CAP_SYS_NICE to 99).
Each level inherits the permissions of the lower level, and none of them
allow the CAP_SYS_NICE ability to affect processes other than your own.

This is a separate issue.  It's about setting the default during login
which can be done with setpriority (still could be done via pam).
