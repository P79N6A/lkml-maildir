   Is it required that the O_NONBLOCK flag be copied from a listening
   socket to an accepted socket?  Dan Bernstein believes this is a
   bug.
If we "fixed" this every inetd on every Linux system would
unfortunately stop working.  So we have to remain bug compatible.
Alexey tried to do this "fix" and when I tested his change we spotted
this issue and thus did not put the "fix" in what we sent to Linus.
