Yes, I do not know of any system that uses type fc.
Concerning crash dumps and the like, this is a topic that comes up
regularly. You may want to read linux-kernel archive.
Probably the main objection to
	 1. Write the oops to a dedicated oops partition.
is that when the kernel crashes nothing can be trusted.
In such a situation it may be very unwise to start writing to disk.
