However, the only sane thing to do is to explicitly define one way or
another. The standard is broken. Consider a threaded application,
where one thread tries to call close(), gets an error and re-tries,
because it's not sure if the fd was closed or not. If the fd *is*
closed, and the thread loops calling close(), checking for EBADF,
there is a race if another thread tries calling open()/creat()/dup().
The ambiguity in the standard thus results in the impossibility of
writing a race-free application. And no, forcing the application to
protect system calls with mutexes isn't a solution.
Linux should define explicitly what happens on error return from
close(). Let that be the new standard.
