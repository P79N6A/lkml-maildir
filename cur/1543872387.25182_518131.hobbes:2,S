I was only pointing out the usefullness of the feature and not
necessarily saying it -should- be implemented! Ofcourse I understand it
will make the controller complicated and thats why probably none of the
recontrollers we are seeing posted on lkml don't support hierarchical
res mgmt.

I believe CKRM handled this quite neatly (by defining child shares to be
relative to parent shares). 
In your example, 256+256 add up to 512 which is within the parent's new limit, 
so nothing happens :) You also picked an example of exhaustible/non-reclaimable 
resource, which makes it hard to define what should happen if parent's limit 
goes below 512. Either nothing happens or perhaps a task is killed,
don't know. In case of memory, I would say that some of child's pages may 
get kicked out and in case of cpu, child will start getting fewer
cycles.

So what are you recommending we do instead? My thought was whatever is
the fundamental unit to which resource management needs to be applied,
lets store resource parameters (or pointers to them) there (rather than 
duplicating the information in each task_struct).
