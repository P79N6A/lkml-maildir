Could you comment on how whell this works (or not) with linuxthreads,
Solaris, and NGPT? I realize you probably haven't had time to look at NPTL
yet. If an N:M model is really better for your application you might be
able to just run NGPT.
Since preempt threads seem a problem, cound a dedicated machine run w/o
preempt? I assume when you say "high load" that you would be talking a
server, where performance is critical.
