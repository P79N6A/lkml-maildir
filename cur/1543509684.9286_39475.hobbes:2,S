Only phhttpd:

We probably need a "fastpoll" library to make the overflow handling as
transparent as possible to the application.

Lots of things.  tcp connection hash tables will get bigger.  Memory use
both by the OS and by the application will grow, so cpu caches will be
less effective.

No.  One local IP address and port can have any  number of
remote connections.  The theoretical limit is the number of foreign
ipaddress/portnum pairs available. :)  The practical limit is physical
memory.
