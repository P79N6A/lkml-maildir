make -j2
I use a script for that:
#!/bin/bash
renice 10 $$
export MAKE="make -j2"
make dep && make clean && export MAKE="make -j2" && $MAKE bzlilo && $MAKE modules && $MAKE modules_install
You may want to experiment with -j2, -j3, -j4 for dual cpu setup. More
processes is sometimes better - it helps to keep the cpu busy.
