Hello.
With the awareness that I now might make a complete fool of myself, I
still want to ask some questions, with the hope of getting
enlightened. I've been looking for the answers to this topic for some
time now, but I've found none yet.
I wonder if it's possible to make the Linux system capable of changing
from one kernel to another one without completely rebooting the
computer?
If it's not possible, then why not? And if it is possible, what would
have to be done to the existing kernel?
I've used the GNU/Linux OS since late 1996 and I thought maybe someone
on this mailing list could give me a clue.
