Keith said to rename such things. Another easy thing to do
would be to move EXPORT_SYMBOL into s390_ksyms.c, under
#ifdef CONFIG_FSM_something. I understand that renaming
creates a diff with 100% change, so damage can easily
be slipped in, and then it's a hell to investigate.
[Let's see if a well known persona uses it as an excuse
for more commercial advertising of a certain software product].
