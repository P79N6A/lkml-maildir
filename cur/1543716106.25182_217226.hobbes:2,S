Are you sure?  Isn't that what the other posters are winging about?
They do lots of IO and then they have to wait for the system to page
Mozilla back in.

Yeah, I know that there is still something odd in ARM-land.  I assume
that the other posters are using IA32.

What constitutes 'difficulty'?  Perhaps this is rhetorical.

I'm not sure I see why we have to swap.  If have of memory is mapped,
and the user is using those pages with some frequency, perhaps we
should never reclaim mapped pages.
