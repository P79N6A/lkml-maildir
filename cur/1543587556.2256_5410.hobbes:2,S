no, infact it really makes it using blocks of 4k (a PIPE_SIZE is 4k), so
it is really equivalent to bs=4k. dd doesn't re-join blocks when
they are smaller then bs=, unless you specify obs=32k.
I have been playing with buffer recently and mixed up both.
buffer is really a nice tool.
But as I said, as long as you don't play with non-fixed block size
you don't have problems.
sorry for mixup.
