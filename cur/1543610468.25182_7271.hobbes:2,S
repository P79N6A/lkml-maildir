I did have a look at it and I would like to express my full
encouragements
to yours efforts. Finally somebody out there caring about modularization
of the kernel, who doesn't continuously introduce sick stuff like...
We remember:
1. Highjacking System V IPC for autoloader communication.
2. "Persistant module storage" patches, which destabilize the
   kernel.
3. inter_module* idiocy.
4. Overloaded system calls.
