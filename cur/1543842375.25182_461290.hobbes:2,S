Am sympathetic to the idea.
Some architectures (eg sparc64) generate large numbers of unresolved module
symbol warnings during an allmodconfig build.  It's not a big problem in
practice - these are subsystems which everyone statically links anyway.
But it does mean that additional work needs to be done if we want to
prevent these allmodconfig builds from erroring out.
