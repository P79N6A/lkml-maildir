Hi,
It's not a bug; it's a feature :-)
multi-lun ATAPI devices exist, though most single lun devices ignore
the lun field and answer to each lun. I preferred to allow the SCSI
subsystem to send multi-lun commands to ATAPI devices unconditionally
and detect a single-lun device multiple times rather than add some
heuristic which will verify if the device is a single/multi lun device
and prevent the SCSI subsystem from sending multi-lun commands for the
fear of mis-detecting a real multi-lun device as a single lun device.
I always considered this to be a minor inconvinience which is not really
worth fixing, but nevertheless we can try (in 2.3.x) to add such
"single/multi lun auto-detecting code".
Meanwhile, if you don't have any SCSI/ATAPI multi-lun devices, booting
the kernel with the "max_scsi_luns=1" command line parameter, or
compiling the kernel with CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN off will detect the
CDROM drive as a single device.
