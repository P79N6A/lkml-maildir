i'm well aware of Steve's benchmarking efforts, but i dont think he's 
finished with it and i'll let him present the results once he wants to 
announce them. I asked about the effects of the "2-d" patch in isolation 
and i'm not sure the numbers show that individual patch in action.
in any case, you are preaching to the choir, i wrote the first 
rt-overload code and it's been in -rt forever so it's not like you need 
to sell me the concept ;-) But upstream quality requirements are 
different from -rt and we need to examine all aspects of scheduling, not 
just latency. In any case, i'll wait for the rest of Steve's numbers.
