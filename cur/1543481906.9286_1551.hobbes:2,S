That's not strong enough.  After `make config' to turn off SMP, I ran
the recommended `make dep clean bzImage' which produced the error trace
I presented.  The command `make mrproper' resets things correctly,
but it also does this: 
    rm -f .version .config* config.in config.old
Which will destroy my hard won configuration.  Bummer.
