OK, for people that care, I did a quick survey of the changes I made.  My
idea is to conform to what is the current "standard" coding style, and not
necessarily what was thrown into Lindent, so that running Lindent on sources
will change as little as is necessary to make it "standard".
I also checked the l-k archives a bit to confirm the changes match the
formatting of the examples given by the King Penguin.
Sadly, lksr is not responding, so I can't look at the history of changes
to Lindent.  Is there another kernel CVS with CVSWeb that was as complete
as lksr?

Hard to measure.

Well, it seems you are in the (slight) minority on this one.  It's not as
big a margin as the other ones, but still measurable.  I wasn't able to
find any examples from the King Penguin himself on this one.  Maybe that
means casts are evil and we should strive to rid the world of them? ;-)
Cheers, Andreas
