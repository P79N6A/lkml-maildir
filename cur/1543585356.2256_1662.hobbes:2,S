Exactly so.  The method does not depend on the sum of preemption being
zip, but on each potential reader (writers take locks) passing thru a
"sync point".  Your notion of waiting for each task to arrive
"naturally" at schedule() would work.  It is, in fact, over kill as you
could also add arrival at sys call exit as a (the) "sync point".  In
fact, for module unload, isn't this the real "sync point"?  After all, a
module can call schedule, or did I miss a usage counter somewhere?
By the way, there is a paper on this somewhere on the web.  Anyone
remember where?
