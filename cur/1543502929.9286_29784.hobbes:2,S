I'll have to try this on my K6/2-400 [1] at work.  I've been suspecting
bad memory, but making the memory timings more aggresive didn't seem to
affect anything.  I could do make -j20 -l10 on a full GNU tools compile
concurrently with a kernel compile and not have any problems.  However,
all the times when I did get a sig11, I was running the GIMPS [2] mprime
program, which makes heavy use of the FPU.
I'll try upping my voltage a notch and let the list know what happens.
