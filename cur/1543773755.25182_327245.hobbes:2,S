Not that my opinion should sway anybody else, but I really would
prefer more of the in-kernel sleep callers were converted to use
human-time units (and thus were verified to be correct) so that
switching HZ will result in the *same* latencies. How much of moving
to lower HZ values is due to the fact that everything is request 10ms
for 1 jiffy of sleep instead of 1 ms? It's hard to tell if the gain is
there or from the lower frequency of interrupts.
I've sent out a lot of patches in this direction (using msleep() and
msleep_interruptible() and my soft-timer rework on top of John
Stultz's timeofday rework converts the entire soft-timer subsystem to
use human-time instead of jiffies as it's unit of expiration), but
there is still *a lot* of work left to do :( I will keep sending
patches, but am being pulled in other directions currently.
Just my $.02.
Thanks,
Nish
