Hello,
I need some help understanding memory layout of
applications within memory under linux.  I am using
the command "pmap" to understand where all the
elements of my application are laying and found that I
just do not understand how and why it is layed out in
a particular fashion.  Is there documentation that
could help me understand memory management under
Linux?
Thank you for your time.
Phy
