This isn't a problem with the scheduler, its a problem with sys_nanosleep.
jiffies_to_timespec( {1000000us} ) returns 2 jiffies, and nanosleep adds
an extra one and asks to sleep for that long (ie. 3ms).
The more erratic timings could be due to interactivity changes as you say,
but you probably aren't running without RT priority
