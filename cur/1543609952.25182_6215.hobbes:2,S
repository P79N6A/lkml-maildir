I wont say that I am absolutely 100% sure that ext3 was never tried on
this filesystem. I am pretty certain, but I'm guessing it doesn't really
make much difference at this point. Your scenario of the corruption
makes sense. I'll see if I can test your patch at some point (but I most
likely cannot).
