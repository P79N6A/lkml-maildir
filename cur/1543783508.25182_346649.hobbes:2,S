Actually, I just did. I changed rmem_max and rmem_default to 4MB and 
tcp_rmem to "64k 4MB 4MB". It did seem to help, but I'm wondering if 
that's simply because it has a _lot_ of memory now to leak before it 
starts eating up into the window size.
I also ran into some very strange packet loss problems that weren't 
occurring yesterday; they only started occurring after I increased the 
buffer size. Most strange. If they happen again, I'll make sure I capture 
the flow to analyze it.
Anyway, that was just to see if I can do anything at all to mitigate the 
problem. I'll try again with smaller buffers (4k 128k 256k) and see what 
happens.
Thanks,
