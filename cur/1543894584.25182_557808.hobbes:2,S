I knew I shouldn't post into the yearly GPL flame-fest... :(

I've contributed some code for the kernel (unlike yourself, AFAICT), and 
believe me, I did so under GPL v2. The COPYING file is pretty much self 
explanatory, so I didn't need to add any explicit license statement to 
my code.

Linus can't and is not _changing_ the GPL. He can however use whatever 
license he sees fit for _his_ code just like all the other kernel 
developers do.
People seem to forget that the kernel license in COPYING *never had* the 
"v2 or later" clause. Never. Period.
The only change in license was from the previous hand-made one from 
Linus into GPL v2 only. And that is perfectly fine since the previous 
license was even more permissive than GPL v2.

No, it is not "any version". It is the license specified in COPYING and 
nothing else.

Man, I sure ain't a lawyer, but people in these discussions seem to not 
understand the basics at all.
And the basics are: "people who write the code decide the license to 
give it". And that's just it.
And people who write kernel code are perfectly aware that the kernel 
license is GPL v2 only, and always has been (except for the initial 
linus license).
So don't go around saying that because people don't put explicit license 
statements they don't care about the license. I care very much about the 
license, and would have never contributed to the kernel if it had a BSD 
license of some sort.
Putting a license statement in _every_ file in the kernel tree would 
just be idiotic when there is such a clear COPYING file in the root of 
the kernel tree.
