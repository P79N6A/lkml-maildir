Yeah, I guess I need to redo my merge messages. Or alternatively, I should 
just remove merges from the shortlog.
The merge message that goes along with that shortlog entry is
	Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>
	Date:   Sat Jun 4 08:18:39 2005 -0700
	    Automatic merge of 'misc-fixes' branch from
	        rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/netdev-2.6
which is pretty readable in the long format, but causes the shortlog to 
pick up just the partial (largely uninteresing) first line.
Removing merges from the shortlog is actually likely the _right_ thing to 
do, since we already miss a lot of merges: any truly trivial merge (ie no 
parallellism) is invisible anyway, except that the committer changed. 
Besides, it's what the old BK changelogs did.
So I guess I'll leave the merge message as is (unless somebody can suggest 
a more readable format), and just update my release scripts to not include 
merge messages.
(Using Jeff's syntax for merge messages isn't very good, since with remote
repositories the names of the repos get so long that the message gets 
unwieldly..)

That's because they don't have branches - when I take the HEAD of the 
repostitory, the changelog entry ends up being just a one-liner again.
Do a "git log" if you have the git tree (or just look at the full 
ChangeLog, which is just the output of that), you'll see what's up.
(Btw, Jeff, I think the git-shortlog script is slightly buggered, it
doesn't do the nice word-wrap, and it _only_ takes the first line, even
from a multi-line header. I think it should stop at the first empty line
in the commit, not just take the first one).
