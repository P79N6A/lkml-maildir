Yes, the I can just write:
        ...
        err = platform_driver_register(&i8042_driver);
        if (err)
                goto err_controller_cleanup;
        i8042_platform_device = platform_device_alloc("i8042", -1);
        if (!i8042_platform_device) {
                err = -ENOMEM;
                goto err_unregister_driver;
        }
        err = platform_device_add(i8042_platform_device);
        if (err)
                goto err_free_device;
        ...
        if (!have_ports) {
                err = -ENODEV;
                goto err_delete_device;
        }
        mod_timer(&i8042_timer, jiffies + I8042_POLL_PERIOD);
        return 0;
 err_delete_device:
        platform_device_del(i8042_platform_device);
 err_free_device:
        platform_device_put(i8042_platform_device);
 err_unregister_driver:
        platform_driver_unregister(&i8042_driver);
 ....
As you can see - single cleanup path..
