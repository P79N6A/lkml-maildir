Just change the line itself, for the 2.4 and 2.6 kernel.org trees...

<shrug>  no biggie either way.  it's just the sorta code I would throw 
an ifdef or "if (static_constant)" around.

That's fine, but it doesn't have to be implemented in the kernel.  Users 
can just as easily download a generic userspace program that checks your 
MAC address, and attempts to assign you one if you don't already have one.
This is a good example of putting policy in the kernel, in fact :)
