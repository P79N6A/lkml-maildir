   (We had a daemon that generated voluminous output via syslogd, and
   Solaris' syslogd didn't have the "no sync" option.)
Solaris is going to sync the metadata (inode etc.) anyways on every
write, "no sync" is not going to help you completely on solaris.  In
fact, strace/truss the solaris syslogd and see if it calls fsync/sync
at all.
