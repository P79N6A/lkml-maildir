Let me guess - you have either a serial console or something like that
and you're running these commands over said serial console?
Or you have console directed to both a serial port and the VT and you're
capturing this off the VT using gpm.
Either way, "serial8250: too much work for irq4" is a printk which will
be displayed by the kernel when it's unable to clear down work for the
serial port within 256 loops or so of the interrupt handler; it's a
protection against the box locking up.
It not actually contained in any of the files.
