I agree here, there is not much difference for the
following aspects:
 - resource accounting, limits and namespaces apply
   to a group of processes
 - they isolate those processes in some way from
   other groups of processes
 - they apply a virtual view and/or limitation to
   those processes

IMHO invisibility only applies to the pid space :)
but as I said, the processes are isolated in some
way, might it be pids, networking, ipc, uts or 
filesystem, similar can be said for resource limits
and resource accounting, where you are only focusing
on a certain group of processes, applying an artifial
limit and ideally virtualizing all kernel interfaces
in such a way, that it looks like the artifical limit
is a real physical limitation

yes, but they do it in a way a normal Linux system
would do, so no 'new' limits there, unless you
disallow changing those limits from inside a space
