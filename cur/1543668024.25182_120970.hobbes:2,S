Same thing, I ran a "find /" and when that didn't crash
it, I ran lynx, and tried to download the kernel from
kernel.org to try and make it die with all the compiling
activity, but just quiting lynx crashed it. Also,
I'm pretty sure this doesn't help, but the caps lock
and scroll lock keys are blinking in a regular interval.
