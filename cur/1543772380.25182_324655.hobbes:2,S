I have checked it again and the patch applies and compiles correctly
against 2.6.12-rc6. So does the updated patch of the day:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/people/francois/misc/20050611-2.6.12-rc-sis190-test.patch
No need to use SIS190_NO_DELAY so far. The media negotiation process has
been changed. It is now allowed to take longer to complete (it should help).
dmesg and ifconfig output will be welcome.
