The best solution to the sound driver issue, IMHO, is still entirely
userspace---
just no-one has written it yet.
What we should do:
1. Before auto-unload of the driver, run a small utility which will read
mixer settings
   and save them somewhere
2. When auto-loading the driver, use driver arguments which are initialized
from the
   settings saved above
All that's missing is the method of passing data from step 1 to step 2.
