Yes, I meant to read old value and to set new one in one system call.
The sysctl system-call does lock_kernel, so sysctl(2) sytem-call 
are serialized.
How about procfs? Are there locks between multiple read-and-write?
Since It seems user-space cannot (or even should not) let kernel 
hold lock(s) during read-and-write operation, procfs cannot be 
the alternative.
Do I mis-understand something?
