In general, yes!  In general, if you cared about performance you
wouldn't be doing such iteration.

Well, that's what's happening at the moment if you look at the code:
	while (cpu < NR_CPUS) {
		unsigned long *in, *out, off;
		if (!cpu_possible(cpu)) {
			cpu++;
			continue;
		}
Spilling the stats is a fine optimization, sure, but that can come
later.
Especially since it need only be done at CPU_DEAD time: the hotplug
CPU patch adds a convenient macro for such things.
"hotcpu_notifier()" compiles out when !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU.
What's there at the moment really is just wasted code.
RUsty.
