Mark Shewmaker provided his archives, so it looks like I have
fairly complete archives of recent linux-kernel (1996.04 - 2000.08)
again. From Alan we got 1993.10 - 1995.07.
Maybe someone can fill the 1995.07 - 1996.04 hole?

The reason I wanted to look yesterday or so was the wish to find
the original Pekka Riikonen mail, but it seems not to have been
on linux-kernel.
  o   Fix the eth= command line and extend it     (Pekka Riikonen)
What precisely was this patch supposed to fix?
