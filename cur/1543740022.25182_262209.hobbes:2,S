No it hasn't.  We still have problems with ARM binutils.  As I said
at the time, forcing us to upgrade _will_ cause major problems.
Essentially, all ARM binutils post 2.11.90 to date remain broken in
one way or another.
I should've been stronger to veto the obsolescence of 2.11.90 for
kernel building.
