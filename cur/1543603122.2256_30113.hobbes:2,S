To find out about new kernels I suggest two techniques.
Low Time Requirement: Go to Linux Weekly News <
http://lwn.net
> at the
end of every week.  They do a good summary of what is up in kernel
efforts.  
Large Time Requirement: Read the kernel mailing list.  Even if you
miss an announcement by Linus or Alan or Andrea et al, you will see
others making postings about every significant kernel.
-kb, the Kent who has taken to compiling most of the kernels that come
out.
