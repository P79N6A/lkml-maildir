True.  However, that depends on the interfaces being used.  Sure, when
a twit "moves things to userland" by marshalling stuff through sysfs,
the only thing it achieves is more sysfs crap *and* more internal kernel
APIs being cast in stone.
However, when the code really is a series of normal syscalls (on the level
of "all we call is sys_something()"), it makes a lot of sense to take the
damn thing to userland and leave it there...
