I have the Intel LanceWood Motherboard 440GX (Dual CPU) with integrated
AIC-7896/7 and two of IBM Manta 10000RPM Hard drives.
The problem is then I run any program which does many writes to the disk
(for example copying huge file or just a program which writes to the disk in
a loop) the system almost freases - Any simple commands as "w" or "uptime"
takes 30-40 seconds to execute. VMSTAT reports low CPU usage - 95% idle and
disk usage is not realy high for the system (1000-2000 bi+bo)  I'm wondering
what might this be.
I used Redhat 6.1, Suse 6.3, Kernel 2.2.14 and 2.2.15pre7 - all are affected
by this problem.
Please help me to find there might the problem be.
