Hello!
> (syslog loglevel for messages was *.*)
Seems, your problem has nothing common with routes.
"redirect dropped" is debugging message, meaning mainly, that
connection to the destination has been timed out.
"No route to host" means approximately the same thing, only
accompanied with arp timeout (and/or, unlikely, icmp).
"SCSI disk error" is scsi disk error, I think 8)8)8)
All this together forces to suspect two things:
- hardware problem. Probably, conflict scsi/ethernet.
- syn flood from local network. It is curable by increasing
  arp cache size, but be careful with this. ARP cache has intrinsic
  timing limits to hold unresolved entries for some time to avoid
  even worse thing: killing network with full rate broadcast ARP.
  Also, if you still not applied patch from ftp.inr.ac.ru, make it
  now. It balances arp table size more smartly.
