locking supposes that you are already running a statd daemon, which
you clearly cannot be doing on an nfsroot system. If you need locking
on a root partition, then you'll need to set up an initrd from which
to start all the necessary daemons...
BTW: Did I understand you and Neil correctly when you appeared to say
that you were sharing the *same* root partition between several
clients?
If so, then that could easily explain your problem: a directory like
/var/lib/nfs simply cannot be shared among several different
machines. Read the 'statd' manpage, and I'm sure you will understand
why.
Cheers,
