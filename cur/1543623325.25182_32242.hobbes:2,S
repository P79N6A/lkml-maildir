Either get matroxfb from 2.4.19-pre2 (it is newer although it may not
look at first glance; I had to remove *PMINFO* naming changes to get 
through Linus filter)...

or set also CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100=y (Gxx0 driver) and 
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450=y (G450/G550 support). Sorry for inconvience,
but I somehow got lost in all these #ifdefs.
BTW, 2.5.6-pre2 matroxfb suffers from same problem. I hope that
2.5.6-pre3 will have it fixed.
