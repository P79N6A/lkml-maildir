OTOH, your approach left us with stuff that wasn't modular at all
(like IPv4) because people felt it was somehow "wrong" to make it
non-unloadable.
I guess it depends on numbers.  If we see lots of drivers which
initialize things and don't really need to clean up, you're right.
If we see far more "I didn't implement unloading" drivers, it's
easiest to do the safe thing: require the author DO SOMETHING to make
the module unloadable, not vice versa.
But the change is trivial,
Rusty.
