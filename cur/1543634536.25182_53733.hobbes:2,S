I want to get this thing tested!  
There are far too many factors for this to be resolved very quickly.
In reality, there will be a lot of disk cost under load which you
don't see in benchmarks, too.  We also know for a fact that the early
hashes used in Reiserfs were quick but were vulnerable to terribly bad
behaviour under certain application workloads.  With the half-md4, at
least we can expect decent worst-case behaviour unless we're under
active attack (ie. only maliscious apps get hurt).
I think the md4 is a safer bet until we know more, so I'd vote that we
stick with the ext3 cvs code which uses hash version #1 for that, and
defer anything else until we've seen more --- the hash versioning lets
us do that safely.

I was getting nearer to 50usec system time, but on an athlon k7-700,
so those timings are pretty comparable.  Mine was ext3, too, which
accounts for a bit.  The difference between that and wall-clock time
was all just idle time, which I think was due to using "touch"/"rm"
--- ie. there was a lot of inode table write activity due to the files
being created/deleted, and that was forcing a journal wrap before the
end of the test.  That effect is not visible on ext2, of course.
