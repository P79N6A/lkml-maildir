I found Ubuntu 6.0.6.1 [1] to support all the hardware of my Asus
P5B-VM (uATX variant) w/ Core2Duo E6400 etc out the box, apart from
the JMicron PATA+SATA+eSATA controller; use the southbridge ICH8 SATA
controller instead.
Seems a solid platform, just note that most DDR2-800 memory is spec'd
to run at 2.0v rather than the 1.8v, so be sure to set this in the
BIOS (defaults to 1.8v of course). I was experiencing intermittent,
silent corruption with large changing patterns in memory @ 1.8v, but
fine at 2.0v with my OCZ DDR2-800.
