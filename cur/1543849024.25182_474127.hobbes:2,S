The warning was the WARN_ON_ONCE from the section below (which is gone
is -rt6)
        if (redirect_hardirq(desc)) {
-               WARN_ON_ONCE(1);
+               mask_ack_irq(desc, irq);
                goto out_unlock;
        }
+
I haven't tried it, but I'd think it will work. That's assuming you have
an "ack" which I hear some PowerPC don't (Benjamin Herrenschmidt talked
about having no "ack" when discussing fasteoi a few month back).
