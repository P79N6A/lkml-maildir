Thank you Eric, the patch you resent has fixed the problem,
which originally happened on vanilla 2.6.13.
But, on such an unusual case, I prefer to mark it unlikely() and
output some warning message.

	if (unlikely(!call_data)) {
		printk(KERN_WARNING "spurious IPI on CPU#%d, ignored\n",
		       smp_processor_id());
		return;
	}
Please take this if you like it, Eric.  I have also tested this
printk-added code.
