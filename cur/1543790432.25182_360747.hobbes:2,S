A couple of months ago I had worked with a 2100 user who was having
some serious problems within a configuration.  I was able to reproduce
something similar in-house and (to make a long-story, short), it turns
out there are some error-recovery problems in the firmware version
currently shipping in qla2xxx (1.19.25 TP firmware to be exact).
After numerous trial and error efforts, we were able to find a
reasonbly stable release with which the customer's configuration could
recover and run (1.17.38 EF, quite old).
In any case, formally, QLogic has dropped *all* support for ISP2100
cards, and thus, it's quite difficult to get any type of traction
from the firmware folk to begin to root-cause the failures.
I'm still in the process of ironing out the .bin distribution details
locally, but perhaps once we migrate to firmware-loading exclusively
via request_firmware(), the (small?) contigent of 2100 could use the
EF variant I referenced above.
Could I get another informal count of 2100 users who are still having
problems with qla2xxx?

Andrew Vasquez
