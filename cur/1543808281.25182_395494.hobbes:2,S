There is no proposal to change cpu_present_map.
The problem is cpu_possible_map.  That is presently being initialised to
CPU_MASK_ALL, which adversely affects perfoermance.  An NR_CPUS=16 kernel
on a 2-way presently has cpu_possible_map=0xffff, which will hurt.
The proposal is this:
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
Initialising cpu_possible_map to all-ones with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU means that
a) All for_each_cpu() loops will iterate across all NR_CPUS CPUs, rather
   than over possible ones.  That can be quite expensive.
b) Soon we'll be allocating per-cpu areas only for possible CPUs.  So with
   CPU_MASK_ALL, we'll be wasting memory.
I also switched voyager over to not use CPU_MASK_ALL in the non-CPU-hotplug
case.  Will that break it?
I note that parisc is also using CPU_MASK_ALL.  Suggest that it stop doing
that.
