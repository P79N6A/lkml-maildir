Yes, I've seen the KURT site, but not looked much closer at it.
Perhaps I should have mentioned Firm Real Time as a third kind. (It's
more or less what I sugested for multimedia later on in the original
post. However, I really don't like the normal mode/real time mode
switching idea...) But as I was more focused on the issue that makes all
the difference to some applications; guaranteed maximum latency; I
didn't consider firm real time significantly different from soft real
time. It is indeed in real life, but not to applications that really
require hard real time.
