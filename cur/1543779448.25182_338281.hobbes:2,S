It's not an official SA_RESTART since the syscall is defined to
support EINTR.  It's clear  that sigwait in this sense is not
interruptible.  Return EINTR from sigwait is only allowed by POSIX
since there is no contrary wording (unlike for the pthread functions).
 But if this clause would be used each and every syscall could return
EINTR and we would have to surround all syscalls with a loop.  Hence
the syscall should be restarted, not because SA_RESTART is set, but
because EINTR shouldn't be returned.
Now, Roland correctly said sigtimedwait and sigwaitinfo need to return
EINTR and we use one syscall for them all.  I overlook that part.  So,
I'll add the wrapper in the libc so that sigwait restarts on EINTR.
