YES, YES, YES...
Reveting "readahead: multiple performance fixes" patch performance came back 
like in 2.6.0.
2.6.0:
64        31.91
128      31.89
256      26.22
8192    26.26
2.6.1-rc1 (readahead patch reverted):
64	31.84
128	31.86
256	25.93
8192	26.16
I know these are only performance in sequential data reads... and real life 
is another thing... but I think the author of the patch should be informed 
(Ram Pai).
for Ram Pai:
