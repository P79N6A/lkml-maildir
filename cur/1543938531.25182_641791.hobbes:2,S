it should be a debugging option in the way that it's dependent on 
KERNEL_DEBUG and KERNEL_EXPERIMENTAL.
i dont think you shold worry about this - i think 64-bit guest support 
for specific hypervisors could be added even after the merge window, if 
it's reasonably isolated (which i'd expect it to be). It clearly cannot 
break anything else so it's the same category as new driver or new 
hardware support - more relaxed integration rules. Then we can remove 
the KERNEL_DEBUG and KERNEL_EXPERIMENTAL dependency as well.
