Hello,
I set up a new raid system with about 500gib space and put reiserfs on it. It 
takes some seconds to mount so I patched my 2.6.17.8-tree with those 
reiserfs-patches from -mm. Mount time was reduced significantly (less than a 
second).
What I found out about these patches is that they can introduce instability, 
but that seemed a bit vague to me.
Up to now I didn't encounter any problems, so are there (theoretical?) 
problems with the on-demand code? Could that stuff go into mainline?
Maybe there are tests I could run, the data on that box is easily 
recoverable ...
Regards
