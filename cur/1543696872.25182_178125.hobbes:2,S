Fair question.
I want it to work with "standard" partition tables such as MSDOS
partitions etc.
I would like to be able to take a single drive that is being used and
has partitions on it, and to add an identical drive beside it, mirror
them, and get a mirrored pair that looked much like the original
drive.
There are issues with the raid superblock but assuming they can be
solved, I want partitioning to work easily.
Can LVM work happily with 'legacy' partitioning information?
