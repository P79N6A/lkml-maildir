I really doubt it.  It's more likely that the xruns are caused by a bug
in the new ktimers system.  I am seeing "xruns" here too with -rt1, but
the latency tracer does not report anything over ~120 usecs.  Previous
to all the ktimers/HRT stuff going in, I was xrun free for months.
The reason I think it's a ktimers bug is because sometimes JACK reports
an xrun of negative length which I'd NEVER seen before.
I suspect this might all be fixed in the latest -rt patch but I have not
had time to build it.
