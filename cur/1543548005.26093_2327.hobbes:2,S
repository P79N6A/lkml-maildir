With all the talk of improving Linux's scalability to
large-scale SMP and ccNUMA platforms -- including efforts
at several HW companies and now OSDL forming to throw
hardware at the effort -- is there any move afoot to 
coordinate these efforts? 
The LSE project at sourceforge seems to have been 
greeted with a big yawn and the SMP list is preoccupied
with small-scale ia32. Are there any >active< forums
discussing the issues and plans? 
Or is it all, whatever there may be of it, taking 
place offline?
Anyone know any (semi-)official contacts at OSDL?
TIA,
Henry
