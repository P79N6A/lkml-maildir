Subject: 2.2.2 processes stuck in 'D' state doing mean things to FS

I was doing a 'load test' on the new kernel and managed to get three
processes stuck in 'D'.  Here's output from ps -alx (applicable procs.):
 FLAGS UID PID PPID PRI NI SIZE RSS WCHAN      STA TTY TIME COMMAND
   800 0   1285 1284 0   0 876  0   wait_on_sup DW p1  0:00 (tar)
     0 0   1316 1288 0   0 772  0   wait_on_sup DW p2  0:00 (rm)
     0 0   1319 1302 0   0 760  0   down_failed DW p3  0:00 (rm)
Kernel is SMP 2.2.2 + DAC960 Raid Beta4 compiled w/gcc2.7.2.3, RedHat 5.2.
256MB.  There is only 1 cpu (450 MHZ Intel PII) installed (other goes in
tomorrow, maybe :-( but it is compiled SMP.
Here's what I did:
window #1: run 32 'memory hogs' each randomly accessng 10MB of ram (256
phys RAM in machine).  Off to swap we go with molasses in our boots.
window #2:  
cd /usr/src; while true; do tar cf - linux/ | (cd /tmp; tar -xvf -); done
window #3:
cd /tmp; while true; do rm -rvf linux/; done
window #4 ('doctor.. it hurts when I do this' 'so don't do it!')
cd /tmp/linux; rm -rf <directory being untarred to and at the same time
rm'ed by #2 and #3, in my case linux/include>
To summarize, window #2 is (was) currently tarring/untarring the
linux/include directory while #3 was in a recursive delete of same.  I
changed directory into the copy of the linux tree (note: the CWD of #3 is
*above* the copy of the linux tree, but #4 is inside the copy of the tree)
and began a second rm -r of the same directory as was getting toasted and
written already.
Here is a 'snapshot' of the last living output of all three windows:
#2 the tar/untar (cwd /usr/src and /tmp):
linux/include/linux/coda_linux.h
linux/include/linux/openpic.h
linux/include/linux/prctl.h
linux/include/linux/ftape-header-segment.h
linux/include/linux/raid1.h
#3 the first rm -r (cwd /tmp):
linux/include/linux/elf.h
linux/include/linux/linkage.h
linux/include/linux/malloc.h
linux/include/linux/mc146818rtc.h
linux/include/linux/zorro.h
(note: zorro.h is the last file in an alphabetic listing... probably
doesn't matter)
#4 the second rm (cwd /tmp/linux):
[root@spike linux]# rm -rf include
(it didn't get anywhere)
Bang.  All three are frozen.
Sorry for the bad news, if there anything more I can provide, let me know.
