The problem is that you have to be able to guarantee that the data is still
accessible once you clear the pending bit.  The pending bit is your only
guaranteed protection, and once it is clear, the containing structure might be
deallocated.
I would like to be able to get rid of the NAR bit too, but I'm not confident
that in all cases I can.  It'll take a bit more study of the code to be able
to do that.
