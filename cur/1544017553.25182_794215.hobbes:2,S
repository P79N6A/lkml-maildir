Ingo, here's git tree for kill-pda patches.
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/misc.git tj-percpu
I dropped early irq_stack_ptr relocation from 0004.  I'll post updated
patch as reply to the original patch.  If you think it's still
necessary, please feel free to discuss it.  I also added a patch to
kill PERCPU_VADDR_PREALLOC().  Will post the patch as a reply to 0005.
Thanks.
