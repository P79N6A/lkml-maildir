Hmmm...  OK then, for the moment, I will stick with the current checks
in the primitives.  Not that I particularly like the "bulking up" of
srcu_read_lock() and srcu_read_unlock() -- but if the super-fast
version is needed, it can easily be provided either within the
confines of the subsystem that needs it, or as yet another set of
RCU-like primitives.  Hopefully this latter option can be avoided!
BTW, the reason for the hardluckref is that I don't want to inflict a
failure return from srcu_read_lock() on you guys.  The non-blocking
synchronization community has repeatedly made that sort of mistake,
and I have no intention of letting it propagate any further.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
