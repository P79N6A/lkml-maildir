Going over the code, I remembered that TIF_DEBUG really does mean moree
than just hw_breakpoint_info != NULL.  It means that the thread
actually has some breakpoints registered.
Why keep the hw_breakpoint_info structure if there are no registered 
breakpoints?  I did it so that the virtualized DR[0-3] values would 
remain intact.
For other processors that have only one debug register, this won't
matter so much.  But of course there are references to TIF_DEBUG in the 
arch-independent code.  Do you think there would be any problem about 
reserving a bit for TIF_DEBUG in the other architectures?

P.S.: I'm just now getting around to doing the stuff we discussed last
week.  It has been a busy time...  At OLS somebody asked when 
hw-breakpoint would get into the mainline.  I guessed that it would be 
a few months before it is added to -mm.  Solving this 
pre/post-notification issue will be difficult.
