I had USB stick (fat32) that reported file system corruption on mount and 
hence was mounted read-only. No amount of umount/dosfsck/mount could make it 
rw again. dosfsck reported device as clean but it still would mount ro and I 
continued to see directory that had been deleted by the very first dosfsck 
run! I unplugged it, looked under Win2k - it was OK - and only then did I 
notice that directory claimed as corrupted did not even exist. Replugging 
it - mounted OK.
I am not sure if this is a bug or "work as designed". May be this is specific 
fat32 problem; still it does not look right?
TIA
