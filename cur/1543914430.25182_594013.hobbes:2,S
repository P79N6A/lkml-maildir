Perhaps, but that doesn't necessarily follow from the above.
From this observer's point of view (and being an expert on disk technologies),
the same "spin up" issue for rotating media could be the culprit here too.
A reset to a disk drive usually (not always) causes it to spin up.
Regardless, Greg has acknowledged the regression and is planning to revert things.
