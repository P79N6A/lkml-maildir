Linus, you're arguing that it's better to let users use something which
is non-portable and silently does the wrong thing, as long as it
actually compiles. That this is preferable to making sure it doesn't
compile. 
Now, there are cases (like _perhaps_ byteorder.h) where we should
probably allow this kind of 'abuse' to continue because it's fairly
harmless and it does actually _work_.
But atomic.h isn't an example of that.
If I wrote a userspace program which relies upon the md5sum of certain
kernel headers not changing, would you decree that the headers in
question should not change at _all_ because that would 'break existing
software'? Of course not; you have to draw the line somewhere. And I
would draw it somewhere between atomic.h and byteorder.h -- where would
_you_ draw it?
