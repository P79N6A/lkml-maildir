easiest might be a shared mmap ring buffer (well 2 of these actually),
kernel puts data in buffer, updates ring pointer (and wakes userspace if
needed). Userspace notices data in ring, does math, puts data back in
the 2nd ringbuffer and updates that ring pointer. Then maybe does a
syscall to 'wake' the kernel. Kernel then sees data in the 2nd
ringbuffer and gets it. In addition to the wakeups I mentioned you can
also poll for the buffers; the wakeups are just there for extra safety.
