Don't use the config option then....

It's not such a big downside IMHO.  You can support a kernel without
printk.  Need to debug the kernel without printk?  Use a JTAG
debugger...
If you have a system that actually configures out printk's, chances
are you don't have storage and output mechanisms to do much with the
messages anyway.  Think embedded _products_ here.  Sure the
development boards have serial, ethernet, and all that jazz but tens
of millions of ARM based gadgets don't.
