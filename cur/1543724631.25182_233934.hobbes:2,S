You're right, but you imply that this is bad. It would only be
bad if _all_ of the kernel development team had the desktop and
multimedia issues very low on the priority list. It would be
far worse if everyone worked on multimedia issues.

Reluctance is good. Reluctance keeps out bloat. Reluctance supplies
time to investigate alternate ideas that might be better.

This is expected. It's how proposed features get widespread testing.

It's too bad that the multimedia community didn't participate
much during the 2.5.xx development leading up to 2.6.0. If they
had done so, the situation might be different today. Fortunately,
fixing up the multimedia problems isn't too risky to do during
the stable 2.6.xx series.

Nah. People do forget about problems if nobody is reporting them.
Since the problem reports came in late, you get to be last.

Much of that is about hot-plug, laptops going to sleep,
busy disks being ripped from the machine, support for
recent video card features, and so on. Multimedia is only
a small part of the big picture, even for desktop usage.
