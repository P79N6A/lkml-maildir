Be careful that some G4's have a bug which can cause a
perf monitor interrupt to crash your kernel :( Basically, the
problem is if any of TAU or PerfMon interrupt happens at the
same time as a DEC interrupt, some revs of the CPU can get
confused and lose the previous exception state.
Check out the erratas, but it may be worth adding a cputable
feature bit entry to note which models have useable interrupt
and which don't.
