Actually, is there any place *other* than write() to the page cache that
warrants a non-temporal store?  Network sockets with scatter/gather and
hardware checksum, maybe?
This is pretty much synonomous with what is allowed to go into high
memory, no?
While we're on the subject, for the copy_from_user source, prefetchnta is
probably indicated.  If user space hasn't caused it to be cached already
(admittedly, the common case), we *know* the kernel isn't going to look
at that data again.
