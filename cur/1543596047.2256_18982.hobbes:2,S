        It seems the libdb is in fact installed. I just added a
symlink from libdb.so.3 to libdb.so and it worked. This was probably a
side effect of installing glibc2.2 rpm from SuSE on top a SuSE 6.3
install (glibc2.1, IIRC).
        Cheers,
PS: Why does the firmware assembler needs libdb, anyway??
