Hi. After yesterday's discussion about problems with my 32-bit UID patches
(namely the fact that they broke compiles of programs using msgctl(),
semctl(), and shmctl() under libc5), I've made the following changes:
	- struct ipc_perm, msqid_ds, semid_ds, and shmid_ds (in
	  include/linux/{ipc,msg,sem,shm}.h) do not change, so that people
	  can compile applications under libc5 and the modified kernel
	  headers
	- include/asm-{arch}/unistd.h does not rename existing system
	  calls; this would confuse builds of the C library
There are a few things that I need to get clarified before I can fix up
the rest of my patches, however:
	- When the C library is being built, several kernel header
	  files are referenced. Does this mean that nothing can ever
	  change in the kernel header files that would result in an old C
	  library being built incorrectly?
	- in other words, can the following never change (to the extent
	  that existing types or structure fields cannot be renamed):
		__kernel_uid_t in include/asm-{arch}/posix_types.h
		struct stat in include/asm-{arch}/stat.h
		union siginfo_t in include/asm-{arch}/siginfo.h
	- if this is the case, I will then go ahead and do the following:
		define __kernel_uid32_t on selected architectures, without
		changing __kernel_uid_t
		change include/linux/types.h to typedef uid_t and gid_t
		to __kernel_uid32_t and __kernel_gid32_t on these
		architectures
		fix up all places using __kernel_uid_t and make sure they
		use the right one (uid_t or uid32_t)
		not change any existing structure fields from uid to
		uid16, but rather define new fields called uid32
Thanks to all who have helped me with this; there are a lot of people who
really need 32-bit UIDs in Linux, and I intend to help them out by making
the 32-bit UID patches as correct as possible.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
