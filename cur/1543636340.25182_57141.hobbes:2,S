One result that seems pretty consistent in these tests is that avoiding the 
page cache is good for about 20% overall throughput improvement.  Which is 
significant, but less than I would have thought if bus bandwidth is the only 
major bottleneck.  Something in the vfs/filesystem/blockio path is still 
eating too much cpu.
Another observation: though only one of the tests hit 100% CPU, total 
throughput is still shows consistent improvement as a result of reducing CPU. 
This should not be, it means there is excessive latency between submission of 
requests, that is, the IO pipes are not being kept full.
