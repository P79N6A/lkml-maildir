Subject: [PATCH] copy_from_high_bh
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
  mm/highmem.c/copy_from_high_bh() blocks interrupts while copying "down"
to a bounce buffer, for writing.
  This function is only ever called from create_bounce() (which cannot
be called from an interrupt context - it may block), and the kmap
'KM_BOUNCE_WRITE' is only used in copy_from_high_bh().
  Therefore, the comment in copy_from_high_bh() is wrong, and the
__cli()/__sti() unnecessary.
  Patch against 2.4.6 below.
Mark
