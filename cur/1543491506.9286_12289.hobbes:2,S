Well, I doubt that the MTRR code is to blame, since it's pretty
self-contained. More likely it changes the kernel footprint slightly
and in the joystick driver there is a bug that is triggered by the
change.
I also looked at your kernel logs, and I note this:
Sound initialization complete
js: Version 1.2.13 using 333 MHz RDTSC timer.
js: no joysticks found
[...]
js: Version 1.2.13 using 333 MHz RDTSC timer.
js: unable to get major 15 for joystick
This implies that you're trying to load the driver twice, which is
wrong. You can easily check this by looking at /proc/devices and
seeing what is allocating major=15.
