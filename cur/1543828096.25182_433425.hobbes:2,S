Indeed, I like what I see (at least those parts I understand) in
roland's utrace code.  One missed opportunity bit appears to be any
new support for something like per-thread breakpoints.
If I correctly understand how gdb etc. work, a hit breakpoint involves
stoppage of all other threads of a process, then the breakpoint
instruction is replaced by the original one, then the thread is
single-stepped, then the breakpoint is put back, then finally all
threads are resumed.  Could utrace API provide short-lived per-thread
page copies to execute the single-stepped original instruction out of,
and avoid stopping & resuming all other threads?
