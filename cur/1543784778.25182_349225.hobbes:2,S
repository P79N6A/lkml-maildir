There were at least 3 fundamentally different
approaches proposed by different people, I implemented
and posted all of them. At least 2 approaches were
publically discussed. Both did what you say. The
one that didn't, wasn't publically discussed either
(the one that ended up in 2.6.12, in fact).
So it is a bit odd that you weren't able to find
the code that does what you say. :)

Do you mean, eg, this?

I allocate it on a ring0 stack. Noone seem to
suggest that. Is this flawed for some reasons?
