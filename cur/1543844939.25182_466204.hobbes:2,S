Yeah, I agree with Jeremy.  It's nice if we can just use it everywhere,
and he kindly explained to me that secondary CPUs we can do most of it
before the CPU bringup (ie. in C): we just have to load the gs register
in asm AFAICT.
I'll produce a patch, so we can see what we're talking about...
Thanks!
Rusty.
