I'm Using Intel EtherExpress Pro 100 with driver included with kernel
2.2.14.
The problem is this problem exists even then I'm trying to connect from
local machone so network driver should not be the problem.
Additionaly I do not have ping increased their time like in the described
situation and The only thing affected is one www server. Other www server
running on other IP is not affected as any of other application. So this
seems to be something new...
