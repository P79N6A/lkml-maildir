Hi. I've updated the patches for 32-bit UID support in Linux to the latest
development kernel version.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991118/
Changes in this version:
	- new patch against 2.3.28 kernel
	- tested and working on i386
In order to use 32-bit UIDs you need the following patches from the above
URL:
	linux-acct.patch
	linux-arch-independ.patch
	linux-ext2.patch
	linux-ipc.patch
	linux-filesystems.patch
as well as a patch for your particular architecture:
	linux-arm.patch
	linux-i386.patch
	linux-m68k.patch
	linux-sh.patch
	linux-sparc.patch
	linux-other-arch.patch
		(needed for alpha, mips, ppc, or sparc64)
Thanks,
Chris Wing
