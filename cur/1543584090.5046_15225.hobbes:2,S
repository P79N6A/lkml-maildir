You can read/write/trash LBA zero all you want with SCSI. It contains
only user (your) data. The disk drive contains a RCT (reconstruction and
caching table). The entries in this are built up during the format-unit
command. If you interrupt the power at just the right instant during
a format-unit, you can corrupt this table and make the drive unusable.
It is highly unlikely that you'd be able to crowbar the supply at just
the right instant, even if you designed the drive and knew what it
was doing at every instance.
This is not something you could do with software. SCSI talks SCSI, there
are no SCSI commands that say "corrupt the RCT". So a virus, although
it can blow away all user data, and can initiate a format-unit command
(BIOS function code 7), can't get at anything that will disable
the drive.
That said, the format-unit command takes some interesting parameters.
One of them is a defect list. It is possible to format the drive so
that all cylinders are "defective"!!  Of course this goes away when
you format the drive without such a defect list.
