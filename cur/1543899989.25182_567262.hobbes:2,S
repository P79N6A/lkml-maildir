Or would this simpler patch be the right one?  I suspect the
mspec driver only says VM_LOCKED because of a deep-seated but
irrational fear that its pages might fall into reclaim.
(I'd like to take out VM_RESERVED too, but that can always happen
another, indefinitely postponed time; there are others of those.)
