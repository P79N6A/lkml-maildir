I tried that. I modified the script so it writes to /tmp/bla a simple
line that the script was started.
Now, when I start it manually by simply typing /sbin/hotplug in the
bash, then the log shows that the script got started (as expected).
However, when I do modprobe speedtch the kernel never runs this
script...
Certainly, I removed the speedtch module earlier (rmmod speedtch) and
checked that it was removed with lsmod.
What I tried to do is manually find the firmware directory in /sys/
after inserting the speedtch. Then I manually did the echo 1>loading,
cat speedtch-1.bin > data, echo 0>loading. And it worked. Everything
after that went fine. So all I am missing is the hotplug script not
being started by kernel at all.

Thanks for your support and the attached rules. If I can't find other
solution I will have to use the minimal udev environment that you
provided.
One more thing - when the modem finally runs in isochronous mode, yet
I cannot get high transfer rates. I can't get nothing more than
3Mbits/s. When I used kernel 2.4 with bulk mode I had only 2.5 Mbit/s.
So there is a little progress, but still not too much. Is it possible
that weak and old hardware (Celeron 633 on a VIA chipset motherboard)
is causing this ?
