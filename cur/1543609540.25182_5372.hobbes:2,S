	I hate to say it, but your question isn't all that useful in its
current form.  What kinds of problems?  What pcmcia version?  What kernel
configuration?  What error messages?  Functional problems?  Compiling
problems?  Cosmetic problems?  Are they reproducable?  How can we
reproduce the problem?
	Please see

	Cheers,
