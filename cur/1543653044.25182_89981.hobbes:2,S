No...look at what you've done.  Now SCSI has to know about every bus type on 
every architecture; that's an extreme layering violation.  architecture/bus 
types are generally only defined for the arch (PCI being the exception), so 
now the additions have to be #ifdef'd just so it will compile..
You've done this because you effectively have to pull a common but differently 
located structure element out of each of these bus specific devices.  That 
implies to me that dma_mask should be in a common structure, which was the 
whole basis for the dmaable_device that I outlined previously.  As I said, the 
only reason I haven't implemented dmaable_device is for expediency.
