Something like that.  I think it's part of GNOME and is responsible for
making sure there's a CD icon on the screen, or something.
We had a different problem with this beast after installing RH6 some
time ago.  Every few seconds it would cause a spew of messages to the
syslog reporting basically what we knew: there is no CD in the drive.
It turned out though that these messages went away when the CD was
properly reconfigured as a CD-writer by appending "hdc=ide-scsi" to
the boot parameters.  Not that this is at all relevant...
Anyway, no I don't know much about it.
