This appears to be a different problem. Something is issuing 
SMART-related commands (smartd or smartctl perhaps) which the drive 
seems to be reacting strangely to. It apparently completed the command 
but never raised DRQ to request any data being transferred even though 
we expected it to. Maybe SMART is disabled on the drive and that's 
causing it to just toss these commands? CCing linux-ide in case anyone 
knows what would cause this.
