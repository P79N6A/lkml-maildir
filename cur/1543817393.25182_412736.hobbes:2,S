I get a kernel OOPS using 2.6.16 and 2.6.16-git14, I was using 2.6.14.2
before without the problem.
The OOPS happens when doing either
echo "3" > /proc/acpi/sleep
or
echo "mem" > /sys/power/state
As I have a laptop without serial ports, I'd have to write down the
oops, so please forgive that I didn't write down ALL the output, I think
I have the most important stuff, though.
Please note that it also happens when mentioned modules are not linked
in and that I enabled the kernel read-only pages option (although that
doesn't seem to be related).
I am not subscribed, so please CC.
