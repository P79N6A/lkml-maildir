If we want to do that we can do that. My design doesn't forbid this. I
only avoid the overhead of the inactive list.
Also note that what I was really complaining is to threat the lru_cached
and lru_mapped list equally. If you threat them equally you get in
troubles as I pointed out. I just want to say that lru_mapped have much
more priority than lru_cache. If you give the higher priority with a aging
factor, or I give higher priority with a different falling back behaviour
it doesn't matter (with the difference that I avoid overhead of refiling
between lru lists and I avoid to roll ex-mapped-pages in the lru_cache
list just to decrease their age).
