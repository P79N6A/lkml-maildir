but for 1: do we care? it is being more tolerant than allowed by a
standard. Those who care can easily add the test in the userspace
wrapper
for 2: we again are more tolerant and dtrt; again. And again userspace
wrapper can impose an additional restriction if it wants
3 is more nasty and needs thinking; we could consider a fix inside the
kernel that actually does wait long enough
I don't see a valid reason to restrict/reject input that is accepted now
and dealt with reasonably because some standard says so (if you design a
new api, following the standard is nice of course). I don't see "doesn't
reject a condition that can reasonable be dealt with" as a good reason
to go double ABI at all.
