I have a module that has a collection of 2-port bridges.  These bridges 
are used for emulation
purposes (somewhat similar to netem's feature set).  Each bridge is 
logically independent
of the others.   To set up a bridge, I do something like:
echo add_my_bridge my_br1 eth0 eth1 > /proc/net/foo/config
Inside the module, it reads "eth0" and "eth1" and needs to find those
devices (ie, dev_get_by_name).  It then registers to receive all pkts from
eth1 and transmit them on eth0, and vice versa.
If it would not require GPL symbols, I have no problem changing my API 
to be something
like:
echo add_my_bridge my_br1 eth0 namespaceX eth1 namespaceY > 
/proc/net/foo/config
I am using procfs so that I don't have to define any new 'official'
kernel ABI, as that would more likely be a derivative work, and is a pain
to keep up to date with changing kernels anyway...
Personally, it seems useful for my module to be able to have eth0 in one 
namespace
and eth1 in another, but I won't complain if they both have to be in the 
same namespace
or even just in the default namespace due to GPL symbol issues.
Thanks,
Ben
