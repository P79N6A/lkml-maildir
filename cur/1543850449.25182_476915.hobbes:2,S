I'm not sure that prune_dcache() is particularly optimal.  If we're looking to
prune for a specific superblock, it may scan most of the dentry_unused list
several times, once for each dentry it eliminates.
Imagine the list with a million dentries on it.  Imagine further that all the
dentries you're trying to eliminate are up near the head end: you're going to
have to scan most of the list several times unnecessarily; if you're asked to
kill 128 dentries, you might wind up examining on the order of 100,000,000
dentries, 99% of which you scan 128 times.
I wonder if this could be improved by making the assumption that there won't be
any entries inserted tailwards of where we've just looked.  The problem is that
if dcache_lock is dropped, we've no way of keeping track of the current
position without inserting a marker into the list.
Now we could do the marker thing quite easily.  We'd have to insert a dummy
dcache entry, probably with d_sb pointing to some special location that is
recognised as saying "that dentry is a marker".
We could do something like the attached patch, for example.  Note that the
patch compiles, but I haven't tested it.  It also uses a big chunk of stack
space for the marker.  It ought to be safe enough with respect to the other
functions that touch that list - all of those deal with specific dentries or
look for dentries by superblock.
