Possible and desirable.  You have to turn off access to all the other
dangerous namespaces though, like socket() and shmat(), and make sure
that nosuid and devices are handled properly. Done right, the only thing
that untrusted code can do is consume a little memory, CPU, and disk,
but that's why there are limits and a scheduler. :-)
One might even want to add back limited access to those other namespaces
by implementing a filesystem interface, ala Plan-9/Inferno.
