Hi Andreas,
Thank you very good comment.

Yes, no guarantee.
but current glibc-malloc very frequently return memory to kernel.
glibc default behavior
1. over 1M memory: return memory just free(3)  called.
    (you can change threshold by MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_ environment)
2. more lower:         return memory when exist continuous 128k at heap tail.
    (you can change threashold by MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_ environment)
if you know very memory consumption by already freed memory situation,
please tell me situation detail and consumption memory size.

Agreed.
if large consumption situation exist, I'm behind you.
Thanks!
