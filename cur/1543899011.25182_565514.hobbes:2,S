granted, this can be a pain (ive spent an annoying amount of time tracking 
down unbalanced quotes/parens/etc... by trying to correlate configure.ac with 
configure), but i dont feel like this is a autotool-specific issue as it can 
come up with other auto-build-generators as well.  heck, a minor typo in a 
hand written makefile can sometimes be a time sink and hard to trace back 
(just look at linux kernel makefiles).
