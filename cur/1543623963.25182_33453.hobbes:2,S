What happens if you remove the printf/puts and simply counts the number
of times the different cases happen?
Another thought: Isn't it quite common that clock generators has a mode
where the frequency differs around the desired frequency to spread the
spectrum
and easier pass EMC tests?
Could that be the case with the laptop?
