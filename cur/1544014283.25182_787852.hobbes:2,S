The tradeoff for speed is always made with extensibility. If you want best
speed - you shouldn't be using the GPIO framework at all - just bang directly
on the registers yourself...
If you want something extensible/generic that serves multiple use cases - 
it will normally come with a performance tradeoff...

Can you define "invalid"? what are the limitations?
Can I use gpio_8 -> 11 &  28 -> 31 as a chunk?

That depends on the semantics of "request". 
If it is "request & build up a monolithic chunk from xxx GPIO's" - then
my definition works.

Sorry for bringing up the muxing - that wasn't the point.
It was really the issue of being non-contiguous, spanning various implementations.

I'll have a look. I don't understand why everyone decided to make their own
userspace GPIO interface - can't we all just get along? :)

Not the ones I run into all the time...
More complex pin multiplexing results in less contiguous free GPIO.
(which again - has nothing to do with multiplexing - it is the result
that is the important thing).

It will be easier to maintain (from a end user perceptive - if someone 
wants a "chunk" of gpio's - they just define it in their platform data). 
It does put a bigger burden on the person writing things.
I would think that the overhead would only be at init - runtime shouldn't
be much different in the simple case, but allowing the complex usecases
with the same interface is better (since we only have to teach people one
thing) :)
