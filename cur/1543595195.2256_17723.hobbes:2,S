Hi,
I've been repeatedly experiencing the same kernel panic. It happens on a
computer that acts as an isdn internet gateway for my home network. Two other
computers, that have the same kernel and NICs but don't do ip-forwarding have
not crashed so far.
* NIC: 3com 3c905B-TX (PCI)
* ISDN: Teles 16.3 (ISA)
The calling stack always looked pretty much the same (see Attachment).
The panic occurs, when multiple internet connections are in use. 
Regards,
Matthias

anything that looked similar to me.
