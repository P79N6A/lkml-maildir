Hi folks,
I noticed that the kernel (2.6.23.1) seems to buffer only certain
partitions on my system:
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 ; do for j in 1 2 ; do dd if=/dev/sda$i of=/dev/null
bs=1024k count=100 ; done ; done

The dd command reads 100 MB from each partition two times in a row. It
looks like sda1 and sda2 are not bufferd (the first 4 dd runs), but
sda3 and sda4 are (the last 4 dd runs).
The computer is a Mac mini with a 2,5" SATA hard disk. The first 2
partitions contain EFI and MacOS X, and are unused in Linux. The last 2
partitions are an ext3 partition for / and an LVM for the rest of the
sytem.
Any hints how the dd/buffering behaviour could be explained? The system
was mostly idle, and the numbers are reproducible across reboots.
Regards,
Tino
