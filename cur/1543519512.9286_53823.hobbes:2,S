You read much more into what I wrote than what I wrote. We intend to keep
our code more-or-less "current" so that, when it comes time for the
certification process, the "latest and greatest" stable release will
be used. It can be used because we have kept current.
A bit of forethought on the part of persons who modify kernel interface
structures can go a long way towards that goal.
