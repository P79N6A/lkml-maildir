Ben,
Just what are the tasks you normally run - and how many code
paths do you think there are out there which you do not run. XFS
might get a bit stack hungry in places, we try to keep it down,
but when you get into file system land things can stack up quickly:
	NFS server -> file system -> block layer -> device driver
With possibly some form of volume management out there too.
I am pounding away on xfs with your code in there including the
checker, and so far it is surviving. But I only have a plain old
scsi drive underneath, and no NFS on top.
Steve
