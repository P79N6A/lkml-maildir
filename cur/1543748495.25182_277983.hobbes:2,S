Hi Ingo,
Here's your fix. I haven't seen anything else cause the bug, and since
it uses local_irq_save, I guess the bounce_copy_vec can be called with
interrupts disabled. Since the kmap_atomic (or just kmap) checks for
that, I don't think I need more than what I've done.
Second, my ethernet doesn't work, and it really seems to be some kind of
interrupt trouble.  It sends out ARPs but doesn't see them come back,
and it also doesn't seem to know that it sent them out. I get the
following:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status e601.
  diagnostics: net 0ccc media 8880 dma 0000003a fifo 0000
eth0: Interrupt posted but not delivered -- IRQ blocked by another
device?
  Flags; bus-master 1, dirty 33(1) current 33(1)
  Transmit list 00000000 vs. f75012a0.

I have a (from lspci) 
0000:02:08.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905C-TX/TX-M
[Tornado] (rev 78)
I can look into this further to see what the problem is. One funny note,
on the vanilla kernel, my eth0 is at interrupt 177, but on the rt
patched kernel its swapped with the sound card and is at interrupt 169.
Well it's getting too late for me now (its 1am my time (01:00 for you
European folks ;-) , and I need to get up at 6:30 am). Tomorrow, I'll
hack on it some more.
Oh, and here's the highmem patch:
