As you should know, irq_chip_set_defaults() ensures that every
irqchip has startup() and shutdown() methods.  Their default
implementations use enable() and disable() ... which in turn
have default implementations using mask()/unmask(), for use
with non-EIO handlers. 
So what's the correct fix then ... use enable() and disable()?
Oopsing isn't OK...

I can understand breaking patches in MM that I've not seen, but not about
breaking anything else.
It was certainly _tested_ on a 2.6.18 ARM board, so you're clearly wrong
about at least that part of your feedback as well as the bits about the
shartup and shutdown calls being "optional" (in any practical sense, since
they are in fact _always_ present).
