What about the situation where the primary storage is a device which
has a limited number of write-cycles.  That's just the sort of
application where you might be archiving data to secondary or tertiary
storage, and it would be a big advantage to save on writes.  If a file
is read every ten minutes, we could just update the atime once an
hour.  That would save five writes an hour.
John.
