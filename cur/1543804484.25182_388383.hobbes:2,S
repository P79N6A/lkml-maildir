Well it is a bit.  Current status is that we just don't have anyone who's
sufficiently familar with VFS internals and idioms who has the
time+inclination to sit down and work with the reiserfs developers to get
the thing into a generally-acceptable state.  Progress has been made over
the past 12-28 months, but there's more to do.  It's a huge piece of code
and a lot of work to do this.
I said I'd do this a couple of months ago but of course haven't had time to
scratch myself.
The second hurdle will be Linus's somewhat-hard-to-define rule of thumb for
such merges: we'll only add such a large burden to the tree if there's
vendor pull for it.  Last time I asked around the vendors the response was
fairly tepid, although that was a year ago.
So reiser4 is somewhat in a state of limbo at present.  We need to
generally up the tempo and firm up some plans rather than letting things
drift like this, but I don't see a way in which we can do that.
