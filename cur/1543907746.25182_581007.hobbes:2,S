Hi,
First thanks for your reactions.
Andi, what i don't understand is, if we only put a minimal patch, like only
modifying the register, perhaps we may avoid having all vendors doing
their own recipe, possibly all messing the one the other. As you said ,
changing this register is absolutely not the actual issue with PAT, but don't
you think such a first step is needed to avoid conflicts since people _do_
already set that register from their driver.
I agree there is work for a comprehensive support of PAT, especially when
dealing with ioremap, but even though we only handle a smallish portion
of the problem yet, perhaps it's time to at least modify that register ?
Of course there is no problem for that being dependant on a CONFIG_PAT.
Kind regards,
Cédric
