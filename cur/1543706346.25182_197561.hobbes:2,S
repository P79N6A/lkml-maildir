The dmapool code makes dma_{alloc,free}_coherent() a requirement for all
platforms, breaking platforms that don't have it (e.g. m68k, and from a quick
browse sparc and sparc64 probably, too).
May not be that nice for a release candidate in a stable series...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
