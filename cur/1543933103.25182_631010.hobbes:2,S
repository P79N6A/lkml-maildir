And nobody confounded by whitespace and coding style is truly
interesting in writing properly functioning code!
I'm going to say it over and over again, everybody who thinks

And everyone who thinks this logging message issue stuff is a
non-issue yet will bash people over the head about coding style in
patch submissions is a hypocrite.
