Also I patched 2.6.23 with that patch and Hibernation works out of box , Suspend to Ram seems to work
fine , just my video card is acting up ( old nvidia card ) I'll play with vbe tool on weekend.
Also I can reproduce that bug in 2.6.23 when I use standby.
I've started to bisect but it will take some time. When I'm done I will post an bug report.
Thanks for your help so far.
