I have been told that it makes a big difference which _sounds_ the
kids are exposed to during a certain age range, when they are
developing the ability to distinguish language sounds.  This would
support the subtitles-better-than-dubbing hypothesis, and also explain
why adults find it easier to learn languages with similar sounds to
their childhood languages.
