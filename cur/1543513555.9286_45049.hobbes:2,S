I got this compile error on the first C-source as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------
$ make bzImage
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c
In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:36,
                 from scripts/split-include.c:26:
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:25: linux/errno.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1
-----------------------------------------------------------
In linux/Documentation/Changes, glibc-2.0.7pre6 is specified.
I am using RedHat-6.1 with glibc-2.1.2 which contains 
/usr/include/bits/errno.h.
Is this a known problem?
Thanks.
