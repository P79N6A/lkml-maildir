Hi there,
I noticed that I cannot use kernel nfsd any more with 2.6.24-rc2, last 
working kernel as of now is 2.6.23.1. First I was using nfsv4 but 
switching to nfsv3 did not help either: exported shares can be mounted 
(client: 2.6-git/powerpc32, nfs-common-1.1.1~git-20070709-3ubuntu1), but 
running "ls /mountpoint" (even without "-l") on the client is enough to 
get the [nfsd] processes in "D" state.
Restarting the rpc.nfsd process on the does not help much, the new 
rpc.nfsd processes get stuck quickly.
For more details please see 
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/2.6.24-rc2/nfsd/
I haven't seen this particular issue on the list recently, hence my post.
I'll try to git-bisect my way through the changesets, but it'll take some 
time...
Thanks,
Christian.
