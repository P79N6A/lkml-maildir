Well, that's not the only case, I think.  I am able to lock up an S2885-based 
box by ripping audio CDs.  The CDs go into /dev/hda, which is a LiteOn 
DVD-ROM and the target is on /dev/sdb*, which is on a 3ware SATA RAID 
controller.  The machine locks up on one CD out of three (approx. 10 tracks 
each), quite regularly (I use KAudioCreator).  It does not lock up this way 
in any other conditions, apparently.

AFAIK, you can't disable the io-apic on these boards.
