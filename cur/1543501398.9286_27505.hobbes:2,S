first:
you can't have your root-filesystem on a modular-device unless you
use a custom-build initrd - how should the kernel be able to load a module
if it needs this module to access the disk on which it resides?
so build your scsi-subsystem into your kernel, and not as modules...

you need at least (if your root-partition is not on the scsi-disk):
alias block-major-8       sd_mod
