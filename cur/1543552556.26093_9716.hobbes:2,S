Subject: FIXED! Updated 2.4 TODO List -- new addition  WAS(test9 PCI resource collisions (fwd)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/10/25/93

The problem is resolved. Mucho Gracias from me and a few (probably
hundreds of people in my workplace) who might want to boot 2.3/4 on these
Dell docking stations (actually we own a few thousand of them, i am just
trying to make sure Linux runs fine ;->)
The proper fix, which is i think what you meant to say is:
-       }
+       } else {
+               /* Transparent bridge */
+               child->resource[0,1,2] = dev->bus->resource[0,1,2];
+       }
instead of "child->resource[0,1,2] = child->bus->resource[0,1,2];" 
You might wanna throw in a DBG() in the else as well, just in case someone
else might have problems with this change.
I have attached the output of lspci in the current 2.4 for perusal. I have
also attached a diff with the 2.2 output (lspci -vvv on both)
cheers,
jamal
