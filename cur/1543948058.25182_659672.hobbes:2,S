Thats what I don't get.  I *did* checkpatch all of these before sending them out (and I have for every release).
I am aware of two "tabs vs spaces" warnings, but the rest checked clean.  Why do some people still see errors when I don't?  Is there a set of switches I should supply to checkpatch to make it more aggressive or something?
