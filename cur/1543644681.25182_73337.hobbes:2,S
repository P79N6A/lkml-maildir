Yep... Sorry to get into the thread late, but Erich, you should really 
look at the latest in-kernel topology API stuff in the mm tree.  I'd be 
happy to discuss it with you over email...  Plus, I'd get another user 
of the topology (to help push it into mainline) and ia64 support, and 
you'd get a generic topology mechanism that works (err, will work?) for 
all architectures.  Email me for more info, or just check out the patch 
that Martin pointed to! :)
Cheers!
