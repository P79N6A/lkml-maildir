Both. 
As you probably saw, it really started out from fixing this silly bug that
was introduced by mistake some time ago - which was due to both the module
init and the "built-in" init code kicking in. The fact that it wasn't
clear which happened where is really for me the driving force here - I'd
like to avoid the same bug cropping up in half a year when somebody cleans
up some low-level driver init.
Oh, and getting rid of the init list in hosts.c is a nice bonus. It just
goes away automatically if you look at the module init path instead ;)
