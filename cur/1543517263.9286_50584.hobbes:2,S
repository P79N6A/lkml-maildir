i ment replacing memcpy itself, for the time being, because that one is
showing the problem. I mean (assuming an ideal compiler), i cannot see any
big conceptual difference - both a builtin and an external (inline)
function should result in similar RTL code emitted, no? Is there something
more subtle about built mempcy? Also i might be wrong about structure
copies, structure copies are using the builtin memcpy, right?
i did not really mean replacing some other builtin functions, obviously
__builtin_constant and others must have internal (version dependent GCC
data-structure) knowledge. The 'etc.' part ment 'memset()' and the other
memory-manipulation functions. Sorry if my sentence was confusing.
