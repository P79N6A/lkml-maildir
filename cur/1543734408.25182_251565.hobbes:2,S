A few days ago I tried to use my Palm Visor under Linux for the first 
time.  It does work (USB file transfers with pilot-link tested), however 
after the first transfer new xterms cannot be started.  If I start say 6 
xterms before using it, they will stay open - but once they are closed 
they cannot be reopened.
I remember reading something along hte lines of vterm expansion problems 
with older 2.6 series kernels, but apparently those were fixed.  Any idea 
why this might be happening?
