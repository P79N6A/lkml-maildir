Hi Russel,
I tried the patch provided by Vitaly Wool. And it works correctly. And 
now I'm successful with the PM support for my own serial8250 driver. Are 
you planning to commit the Vitlaly's changes into the mainstream? I 
guess it'll be helpful for the other people too. What I want is to know 
whether this changes will be supported by the Community or not. It's 
important for the project I'm worin on, cause I'm planning to push it 
into Open Source ;)
Thanks,
Grigory.
