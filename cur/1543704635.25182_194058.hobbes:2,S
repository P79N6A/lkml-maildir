I'm not sure what "as expected" means with this small a limit, hopefully
not "pages its butt off." I am printing a hardcopy of the 2nd patch and
a bit of the surrounding code, and also compiling a new kernel with the
patch in place, so I can play a bit in the morning.
I also wonder if a sanity check is desirable on the minimum size. At
some point I would think the system would get a lot of overhead trying
to actually use a single 1k page :-(
Thanks for this prompt implementation, I do have a few applications
which can use it!
