All this is fine and dandy, but saying "My code is better than yours!!" still 
doesn't solve the issue this thread hopes to achieve, that being "I'd like to 
get reiser4 into the kernel".  There seems to be a lot of (historical?) 
tension present here, but all that seems to be doing is making things worse.  
PLEASE keep this thing a tad on par.  Keeping this up is hurting everyone 
more than helping.  I wish I could say something as simple as "let's just be 
friends", but that's saying a lot.  I can say this though: this is open 
source, and that means that our source is open, and we should be too.
