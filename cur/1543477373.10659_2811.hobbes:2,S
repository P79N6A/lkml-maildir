Due to the last message I sent about partitions in reply to
someone, I want to do some experiments with some partitioning.  I
would like to obtain some documentation on exactly how the
partition table is layed out, as well as how the extended
partition tables (or various different ones) are layed out.  I
have a decent understanding of the main partition table, and have
manually edited it on numerous disk recovery situations, however
I've not had much need to muck with extended tables, and have no
idea how or where they are stored, and what the layout is.
Pointers to docs and source code would be great.  I'm going to
grab the various fdisk programs sources, and LILO sources for
starters.
Thanks, TTYL
