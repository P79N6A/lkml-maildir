Okay, so Patrick broke ARM and you fixed it. But he also broke i386 and
x86-64; and it is not at all clear that his "newer" version is better
than the old one. [Really, what's the advantage? AFAICS it is more
complicated and less flexible, putting "suspend" method to bus as
oppossed to device].
I guess I could survive dm changes going in, but breaking both driver
model, sleep support and all the drivers at same time is a bit too
much...
