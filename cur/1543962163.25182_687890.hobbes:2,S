I was trying to stay out of it a bit, since you both have very good
points. :)
But, from a purely aesthetic point of view, I like the patches.  They do
make r/o mount detection less error-prone in coding.  They also remove
more code than they add.
I also certainly understand Al's point about why it puts vfsmounts in a
place where they probably shouldn't be exposed.
Is there a way we could pass around a vfs-internal object to these
things?  Maybe something that is like an opaque token only known to the
vfs?
linux/mount.h:
	struct hidden_mount;
fs/namespace.c:
struct hidden_mount {
	struct vfsmount *mnt;
};
int mnt_want_write(struct hidden_mount *hidmnt)
{
	return __mnt_want_write(hidmnt->mnt);
}
We could have *that* passed down the way that you're currently passing
the vfsmount.
