This is a surprise.  I expect that the -mm-only
profile-likely-unlikely-macros.patch is the cause of this and mainline
doesn't have this problem.
If true, then this likely/unlikely bloat has probably spread into a lot of
your other results and it all should be redone against mainline, sorry :(
(I'm not aware of anyone having used profile-likely-unlikely-macros.patch
in quite some time.  That's unfortunate because it has turned up some
fairly flagrant code deoptimisations)
