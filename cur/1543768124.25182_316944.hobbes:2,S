I tried this version with the same results.
It seems that I've got something weird in my compilation setup.
I set up a serial console to see the messages from boot and near the 
beggining I get:
"Unknown bustype PCI    - ignoring"
The code that generates this is at arch/i386/mpparse.c:

BUSTYPE_PCI is defined at include/asm-i386/mpspec_def.h:
#define BUSTYPE_PCI	"PCI"
so that first "if" statement translates to
 > 	} else if (strncmp(str, "PCI", 3) == 0) {
which should be always valid for "PCI   ", and that message should never 
appear :(
Well, sorry about the noise, I must dig deeper now...
