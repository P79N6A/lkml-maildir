That would give a different result: "functional TCP connections" or
"non-functional TCP connections". Mine are between that. If data gets
sent in small chunks, everything is fine, but if it's a larger
transfer (more than one ethernet frame may transport???), write()
stalls (or non-blocking write returns), but data is kept in
Send-Q rather than being sent down to the client.
Well, my setup is a LAN, everything here is fully functional wrt.
ECN. I've never switched ECN off, and 2.4.x is running since ages
on the boxes around. So it's definitely *not* ECN in this case:-(
