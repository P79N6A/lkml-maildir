require actual discussion.)
Hello, this thread started with me asking for help regarding
the zero-based percpu patches and the initial message is quoted
below.

IIUC, Rusty is somewhat leaning toward limiting per-cpu area and using
static allocator. (right?)  As I was trying to do more stuff per-cpu
(not putting a lot of stuff into per-cpu area but even with small
things limited per-cpu area poses scalability problems), cpu_alloc
seems to fit the bill better.
Anyways, I think it's worthwhile to listen what people have on mind
regarding how per-cpu stuff should proceed.
Thanks.
