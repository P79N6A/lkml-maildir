Hi,
I'm using sb16. Since changing to 2.4.0-test7, it's not working
anymore. Used to work for test5.
/var/log/messages
Aug 24 12:57:33 localhost kernel: Soundblaster audio driver Copyright

Aug 24 12:57:33 localhost kernel: sb: No ISAPnP cards found, trying
standard ones...
Aug 24 12:57:33 localhost kernel: SB 4.11 detected OK (220)

Aug 24 12:57:33 localhost kernel: Sound: Hmm, DMA1 was left allocated
- fixed
Aug 24 12:57:33 localhost kernel: Sound: Hmm, DMA5 was left allocated
- fixed
/etc/modules.conf says:
alias sound sb
#alias char-major-14 sb
#post-install sb
options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=7 mpu_io=0x330
I experimented with commenting and uncommenting the above, with no
success
cat /proc/ioports /proc/interrupts and /proc/dma all showed that the
relevant areas are not used.
modprobe sb did not succeed.
Switching back to test5 works.
Any help?
Thanks
