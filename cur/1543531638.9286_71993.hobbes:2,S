No, it doesn't... doesn't that suck.  The problem is, even if you specify
user geometry (which it lets you do) it still seems to read the LBA capacity
off the drive and do a sanity check with it or something.  So you still need
to set the cylinder limits jumper or else it locks up.  I am going to give
Diamond (motherboard maker) a call today, and see if I can't get an updated
BIOS.  Their website is so bad, I am hoping they have made a newer version
just haven't put it out on the web.
