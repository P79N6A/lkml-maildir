We broke kppp with a security fix. Fixing readlink() broke a buggy glibc
version. Fixing file opening broke a buggy java tool. It isnt like there
are no other java engines. Whoever built the buggy jdk needs to build an
unbuggy one. Someone at blackdown.org needs to type make.
The one I feel most sorry for is actually kppp. Both readlink() and open()
have clear posix/SUS definitions. kppp got caught by a neccessary fix that
is enshrined only in 'tradition'
