a) We dont care of possibly off values when reading /proc/net/sockstat
    Same arguments apply for percpu_counters.
b) It is called from network parts where preemption is disabled.

You are playing with words.
The array was exacly sizeof(void *) * NR_CPUS  (at least when pcounter were 
added in network tree, commit b3242151906372f30f57feaa43b4cac96a23edb1 was 
done only ten days ago). Then it needed 32 bytes per possible cpu (maybe less 
now with SLUB)

Yes, per connection basis. Some workloads want to open/close more than 1000 
sockets per second.
You are right we also need to reduce all atomic inc/dec done per packet :)
A pcounter/perc_cpu for the device refcounter would be a very nice win, but as 
number of devices in the system might be very big, David said no to a percpu 
conversion. We will reconsider this when new percpu stuff can go in, so that 
the memory cost will be minimal (4 bytes per cpu per device)

Please do : nm vmlinux | grep tcp_pcounter_add
c03a74a8 t tcp_pcounter_add
It should be there, even if its a static function

I have no benchmarks, but real workloads where it matters, and where userland

Fact is that we need percpu 32bits counters, and we need to have pointers to them.
Current percpu_counters cannot cope that.

I believe all 'pcounter' are in fact statically allocated 'one per struct 
proto' to track inuse count. (search for DEFINE_PROTO_INUSE() uses)
# find net include|xargs grep -n DEFINE_PROTO_INUSE

So pcounter_alloc()/pcounter_free() could just be deleted from pcounter.h
indirect functions calls are everywhere in kernel, network, fs, everywhere.
As soon we can put in 'struct pcounter' the address of a percpu variable, we 
wont need anymore pointers to the pcounter_add()/getval() function.
mov  0(pcounter),%eax  # get the address of a percpuvar
add  %edx,fs:%eax
This just need the percpu work done by SGI guys to be finished.
