This is currently a 1.  Reset to 0 by the above.

Hard to tell, not much running except fetchmail/procmail and this composer.

The crf1.txt is with it=1, the cfr0.txt is with it zeroed.

And I let the crf0 version run longer as I was looking for the composer's pid, 
but htop (or I) can't see it.  Even a ps -e isn't seeing it!  But its 
running, I'm actively typing in it.  So you get 3 files, the third one called 
ps-e.txt, in private mail.  I thought it was called composer, I really did.
