Greetings,
    With all the recent buzz about pcmcia and laptops I can't help but
ask.  Is anyone working on hacking in support for the win modems?  If
you want to talk about a worthless port on probably half or more of the
laptops in service using linux that would be it.
    Anyone know of drivers already in development?  Is there a technical
or legal reason we can't do this?
    I'd lend my two cents worth of coding to a project like this, so
drop any info my way!
ttfn,
jjh
