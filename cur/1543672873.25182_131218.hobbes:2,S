Yup.  The best place usually is the first link here:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/testing/cset/
the "Gzipped full patch".

oop, very true.
Nasty.  Maybe the best approach is to mostly uninline the access_ok()
check.  Do the check for constant-sized small copies first, so those guys
still do the access_ok() check inline; uninline the rest.
It'll hurt the microbenchmarks (again), but it's a general article of faith
that keeping the kernel's cache footprint small is a net win...
Let me think about that for a bit.

Turns out that it only happens with `-O1'.  -O2 is OK.  I use -O1 because
it is faster.  I use gcc-2.95.3 because gcc-3.x is unacceptably slow.
