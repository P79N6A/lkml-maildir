This idea sounds just fine.

I have a better idea.  Look, all the dev->features and flag names are
in the kernel tree already.  The only thing which hasn't propagated
which the driver will reference are the skb frag things.  This code
referencing the skb frags in the 3c59x hard_start_xmit method you can
just protect with #ifdef MAX_SKB_FRAGS or similar.  See?
