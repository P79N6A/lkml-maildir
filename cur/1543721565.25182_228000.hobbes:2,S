sym2 too -- 32, 40 and 64-bit, but with the restriction of the 64-bit
mode that it's limited to accessing 16 4GB segments.

Sounds good to me.  
So let's look at the sym2 implementation to see how this would work.
A straight diff -u is not terribly helpful, So let's try a more verbose
context diff:

There's an obvious problem here -- no error checking on the second
