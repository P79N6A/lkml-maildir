The gdb debug data lets you find each line and also the variable
assignments (except when highly optimised in some cases). Try
breakpointing there with kgdb and using "where"... A kgdb script is the
wrong way to do instrumentation but it does demonstrate the information
is already out there, automatically generated and self maintaining.
You do need the gdb -g debug data, but equally if it was static you'd
need to recompile with the tracepoint because it would be off by
default, and there is a very small risk in both cases you'll disturb or
change the code behaviour/flow.

Thats why we have things like systemtap.
All we appear to lack is systemtap ability to parse debug data so it can
be told "trace on line 9 of sched.c and record rq and next"
