I have modified my patch series so that the final patch that
introduces my ACPI-PCI slot driver is a full-fledged module, that
has a tristate Kconfig option.
It can be modprobe'd/rmmod'ed in any combination, and in any
order with other PCI hotplug modules. There is no ordering
dependency, even at module unload time, so you can safely rmmod
pci_slot, and safely continue using features provided by the PCI
hotplug drivers (acpiphp, pciehp, etc.). The opposite works too.
The one limitation is that two separate hotplug drivers cannot
both claim the same device (2nd module loaded will get -EBUSY
errors), but I do not believe that is a regression from current
behavior.
I have only tested with acpiphp and pciehp, as that's the only
hardware I have, but I believe my code will play nicely with the
other PCI hp drivers as well.
The patch series is fully bisectable, and the correct behavior
occurs no matter which patch you happen to have applied.
I'll be sending v5 of patches 3 and 4 shortly (patches 1 and 2
did not change). It is still based on 2.6.24-rc2, because I was
too scared to do another git rebase while using stgit. :-/

You are, of course, correct.
In my opinion, though, I would say most of the changes to the PCI
hotplug drivers themselves are pretty straightforward, as in
removing the different ways of getting the PCI address.
The scary part of the changes (aside from the ACPI-PCI slot
driver) revolve around the new struct pci_slot, which is
relatively self-contained, and only expose themselves via the
pci_create_slot/pci_destroy_slot interfaces which only the PCI
hotplug corecares about.
Regardless, your point stands. How do you suggest I get more
testing time? Is this patchset appropriate for the -mm tree yet?
Or do you think it still needs more work?

Thanks for testing. Please let me know how v5 works for you too.
