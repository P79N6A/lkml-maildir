Indeed. Mismatching allocator and deallocator is bug, even if it happens
to work for SLAB/SLUB.

If a slab contains a dentry that is pinned, it can only be used for
other dentries and cannot be recycled for other allocations. If updatedb
comes along and fills memory with dentry slabs, many of which get
permanently pinned, then you have wasted memory.

Yes. You've got (most of) a fix. It's overly-complicated and SLOB
doesn't need it. How many ways do I need to say this?

a) alignment doesn't increase memory use because the memory before the
object is still allocatable
b) kmallocs aren't aligned!

The alignment minimum varies per arch. SLOB can go down to 2 bytes.

It's a measurement from memory. But it roughly agrees with what you'd
expect from a random distribution.

Uh, no. You'd need a new slab for every multiple of 2 bytes. And then
you'd just be making the underused and pinned slab problems worse.
