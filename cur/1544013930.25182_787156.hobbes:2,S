Probably the same issue. The problem is that the first use of a variable 
is in the OR section of an if statement that does a return.
	if (x || !(y = init_me())
		return;
	use_me(y);
IMHO I find this sloppy code. When reading the code it can cause reviewers 
trouble, and wasted time, to see that y is indeed initialized. I'm 
impressed that gcc was able to figure it out.

Have you always been compiling with -Werror?
The reason that gcc complains is because you have the "branch_tracer" on 
that converts 'if ()' into a macro (as you saw in your -E compile). This 
makes the if statement more complex, and goes beyond gcc's ability to know 
that the above 'y' is initialized properly. I would work on fixing this in 
the branch tracer, but honestly, I'm kind of glad that gcc barfs on it. 
This will help us point out this kind of sloppy initializations (sorry if 
I'm offending anybody about calling it sloppy). I just believe that it 
makes the code a bit more obfuscated to initialize in an if statement, and 
a second part of a complex if statement at that!
