I am stupid.
Somehow I didn't even try to think about false _negative_, and it is
possible without ->siglock.
If we race with sigaction() which changes ->action[SIGCHLD]
	from:	{ .sa_handler = SIG_IGN, .sa_flags = 0 }
	to:	{ .sa_handler = handler, .sa_flags = SA_NOCLDWAIT }
we can read the stores out of order, and ignoring_children() may
return the wrong "false". Nothing really bad can happen, and the
race is mostly theoretical, but still this is not right.
Andrew, please replace
	ptrace-simplify-ptrace_exit-ignoring_children-path.patch
with the new version below.
I'll also re-send the next one,
	ptrace-reintroduce-__ptrace_detach-as-a-callee-of-ptrace_exit.patch
because it should be re-diffed, and because I forgot to update the comments.
Other patches I sent can be applied cleanly.
Sorry for inconvenience!

[PATCH 2/4] ptrace: simplify ptrace_exit()->ignoring_children() path
In order to avoid the unnecessary ignoring_children() calls, ptrace_exit()
uses "int ign" to cache the returned value.
This makes sense because ptrace_exit() works with the list of tracees, but
the next patche changes this code to work with individual threads.
Remove this optimization, I don't think it is common to exit with a lot of
attached EXIT_ZOMBIE tracees. And this makes the code a bit simpler.
Also remove _irqsave/_irqrestore, this code always runs with irqs disabled.
