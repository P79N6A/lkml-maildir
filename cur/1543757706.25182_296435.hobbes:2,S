i have an old ECS mboard and an old MSI
board where that's true, but that's
because the mboards' too old and their
hardware actually weren't designed to
work with bus disconnect turned on.
The newer one's i have all work ok with
the last few iterations of the Linux
kernel and i've had uptimes that spanned
the weeks between kernel upgrades.  Until
the latest 2.6.11-rc4 anyway.
