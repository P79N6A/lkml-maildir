The Perl version uses Math::BigInt, a Perl standard module (with a
canned-values fallback for ancient or minimal Perl installations) to do
arbitrary precision arithmetic.
The original version also produced constants that could be used with
64-bit values, but since gcc doesn't support 128-bit arithmetic on
32-bit platforms (gcc *does* support 128-bit arithmetic on 64-bit
platforms) we didn't end up using it and removed them, although the code
to generate them can still be activated.
