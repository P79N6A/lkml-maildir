You've corrupted your 2.2.14 source tree at a guess.
Mandrake has a little kink in that /usr/src/linux is a symboloc link to
/usr/src/linux-2.2.14. When you unpacked the 2.2.16 distribution it tried
to go in /usr/src/linux and ended up overwriting parts of linux-2.2.14
I'd suggest you go to /usr/src and remove the linux symbolic link and
unpack the distribution again. If you need to go back to the 2.2.14 build
at any time you will have to restore it from the Mandrake CDs.
