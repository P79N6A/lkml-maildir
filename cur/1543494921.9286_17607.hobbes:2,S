Run make menuconfig. Go into the "sound" section.
Say Y to sound card support, OSS sound modules, and
ProaudioSpectrum 16 support.
PAS16 IRQ and DMA settings suddenly show up when you says
Y to proaudiospectrum 16 support.
These settings will not show if you use modules.
You specify irq/dma when loading the modules instead.
look at manpages for modprobe, insmod and /etc/conf.modules.
