Yes. However, I have this suspicion that that is just more confusion by 
the BIOS tables. 
The reason APIC #0 wasn't enumerated is that it doesn't seem to exist in 
the MP tables. So not only does the PIRQ table not contain any information 
about that bus, but the MP tables are very silent about it too.
I dunno.. Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it really looks like your BIOS 
tables are just pretty broken. 
It would really be interesting to hear whether using ACPI enumeration 
fixes it or at least whether the symptoms are different. Especially with 
newer hardware, the BIOS people have only ever tested their tables with 
Windows, and ACPI will have overridden any MPtable information, so..
