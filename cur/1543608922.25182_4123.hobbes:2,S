Subject: Kernel 2.4.14 link error

This is my first nervous attempt at kernel stuff (sweat, panic...)
Kernel 2.4.14 does not link if loopback device is enabled. The link fails
with unresolved extern reference "deactivate_page" in block.o
This function is called from drivers/block/loop.c and is located in
in mm/swap.c for kernel 2.4.13 but not for 2.4.14.
I made a copy of loop.c commented out the references (2) to deactivate_page
and compiled as a module, which seems to work just fine.
Hope this helps
