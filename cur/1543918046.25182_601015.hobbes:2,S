No, they're helpers.  eg:
static void lguest_exit_lazy(enum paravirt_lazy_mode mode)
{
paravirt_exit_lazy(mode);
lguest_flush_hcalls();
}

Probably overkill (I was trying to avoid the branch for the case where
we don't need to flush, as that's always what happens).
So just expose a flush hook:
static inline void arch_flush_lazy_cpu_mode(void)
{
	PVOP_VCALL1(flush_lazy_mode, PARAVIRT_LAZY_CPU);
}
....
static void lguest_flush_lazy_mode(enum paravirt_lazy_mode mode)
{
	if (unlikely(x86_read_percpu(paravirt_lazy_mode) == mode)) {
		lguest_lazy_cpu_leave();
		lguest_lazy_cpu_enter();
	}
}
Cheers,
Rusty.
