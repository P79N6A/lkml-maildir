 Note that zeroes are an internal buffer overrun message from the 8048 (or
whatever) that is present in the keyboard (not to be confused with the
8042 or equivalent that is normally present on the motherboard).  So it's
a good idea to ignore them (logging them as errors would probably be an
overkill).
