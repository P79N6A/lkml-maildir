this is in boot.swap initscript:
check_swap_sig () {
    local part="$(get_swap_id)"
    local where what type rest p c
    while read  where what type rest ; do
        test "$type" = "swap" || continue
        c=continue
        for p in $part ; do
            test "$p" = "$where" && c=true
        done
        $c
        case "$(dd if=$where bs=1 count=6 skip=4086 2>/dev/null)" in
        S1SUSP|S2SUSP) mkswap $where
        esac
    done < /etc/fstab
}
so if the user passes "noresume", the boot scripts fix up the mess :-)
An unconditional "mkswap" on the swap partition is a not-so-good idea
unless you check the ID of the partition from the partition table since
mkswap will create swap on anything you give him which may not always
be what you wanted.
Anyway, i think it is not too bad doing such cleanup stuff in userspace.
