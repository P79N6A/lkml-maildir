The problem with labels at the end of blocks, like so:
   {
      ....
      goto out;
      ....
   out:
   }
is that this is not legal C: The label should be part of a sentence, and
there is none. Just write (note the ';' after the label):
   {
      ....
      goto out;
      ....
   out: ;
   }
(Yes, this is ugly).
