I fail to understand the point you're trying to make.  Are you 
suggesting that a feature doesn't necessarily have to be implemented, 
just because it's there?  If so, the proposed idea on the "elastic" file 
system differs greatly.  Cached content, for instance, speeds up the 
browsing experience *without* hindering the ability of the application 
to function normally.  Caching is a true enhancement --in most 
circumstances.  I can personally see no way to implement EQFS without 
greatly exasperating end users with its shortcomings.
