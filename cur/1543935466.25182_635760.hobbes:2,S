Reminds me this is something that should be actually flagged
in checkpatch.pl too
Andy, it would be good if checkpatch.pl complained about .ioctl = 
as opposed to .unlocked_ioctl = ...
Also perhaps if a whole new file_operations with a ioctl is added
complain about missing compat_ioctl as a low prioritity warning?
(might be ok if it's architecture specific on architectures without
compat layer)
