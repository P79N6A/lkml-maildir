Yeah, the second patch was using an u64.
I ended up using a "class" name (signalfd, timerfd, asyncfd) as dname 
entry. An incremental counter would not add any useful information, and 
noone will ever care about dentry name of those objects. Prolly the class 
name is the only thing you might want to know, or we can drop even that 
and use a shared dentry for everything.
