Yeah, sorry, the diff you noticed is a horrid seven-second-hack I've
carried in my tree since the new Kconfig stuff went in (2.5.early) because
I want my .config to be a symlink to a revision-controlled file and the
Kconfig system (brokely) insists on blowing away the symlink each time you
run it.
A proper patch (which maybe does an lstat+special-stuff) would be nice.
But that particular diff only appears in the -mm rollup when I'm carrying
other patches against confdata.c, which rarely happens.  So it'll go away
again.
