Do we truncate mmap() values to the nearest page so to not confuse the
user? ;)
Imagine a careful application setting and accounting for limits on a
long-running system.  Might its internal accounting get sufficiently
misaligned from the kernel's after a while to cause a problem?
Truncating values like that would appear reserve significantly less
memory than desired over a long period of time.
