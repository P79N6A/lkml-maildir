Subject: [01/12] splice: use mapping_gfp_mask

2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
upstream commit: 4cd13504652d28e16bf186c6bb2bbb3725369383
The loop block driver is careful to mask __GFP_IO|__GFP_FS out of its
mapping_gfp_mask, to avoid hangs under memory pressure.  But nowadays
it uses splice, usually going through __generic_file_splice_read.  That
must use mapping_gfp_mask instead of GFP_KERNEL to avoid those hangs.
