Subject: send and recv function for UDP

Hi all,
An I use sock_recvmsg() sock_sendmsg() function to send data on a UDP socket 
opened in a kernel module?
The problem is, when I use sock_recvmsg at the server side, it will  not 
wait at all for the client to send data. It behaves asynchronously. It will 
come out with received count as zero.
I cannot use, sock_read since I cannot get the (struct file *), a required 
parameter and there is no function like sock_recvfrom which is conunter part 
of recvfrom for kernel programming.
These were the options I tried. Could any one suggest how to come around the 
problem for sending data using UDP in a kernel module.
Thanking You
Shesha
