But it does. If you look at the console code it always calls set_palette
which in turn calls fbcon_set_palette which in turn calls fb_set_cmap. 
This happens every time you VC switch. A few driver writers noticed this
and don't bother with calling fb_Set_var in con_switch but instead a few
pieces of the function. But because of the way the current console system
is designed the colormap will always be set on VC switches.
