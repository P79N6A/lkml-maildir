Thanks for the tip, I hadn't heard about it.  I will take a look,
but only to see if it can show me the user space API of /dev/fb.
I don't need a general library that supports a bunch of different
graphics cards.  I'm writing my own frame buffer driver for the
GX2 CPU, and I just want to know how to call the various functions
registered in struct fb_ops, so that I can test my code.  I mean,
all those functions registered in fb_ops must be accessible
somehow; if they weren't, what purpose would they serve?
