The patch did change over time, but not that much, minor bugfixes for
it.  I didn't think to update the original date in the quilt file,
sorry.  It was in -mm for quite a while, so I thought it got a good
enough testing period.
I'll try to remember to update the timestamp on patches that get
updated, it's a pretty rare thing for my patchflow, shouldn't be hard to
remember.
