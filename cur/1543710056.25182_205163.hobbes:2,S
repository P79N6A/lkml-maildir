| Problem is, that we're supposed to complain for

| 	const t x;
If I can help with an existing pratice, in C++ the former is
invalid and the second is valid -- the extra const is just silently
ignored.  Therefore, in C++ land the construct
| 	const int a;
| 	const __typeof(a) x;
would be accepted because __typeof__ acts like an unnamed typedef[*].
(And in effect, g++ will accept the code -- assuming you abstract over
initializers).  So, it does not look like an innovation here.
I don't know whether this should be another case for "C is different
from C++".
[*] Yes, an alias that does not introduce a name is strange alias, but
    that is what __typeof__ does.
