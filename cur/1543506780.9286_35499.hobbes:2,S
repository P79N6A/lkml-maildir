Since one of several USB chipset drivers can be loaded, it seems
that it is possible to load the driver without anything noticing
that it is used:
usb-uhci               13784   0  (unused)
mouse                   2580   1  (autoclean)
usbcore                15164   0  (autoclean) [usb-uhci mouse]
This has the unfortunate consequence that usb-uhci can be rmmod'ed
when it is in use. Can anyone point out how this deficiency should
be addressed?
Paul
