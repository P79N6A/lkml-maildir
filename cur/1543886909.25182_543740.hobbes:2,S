Perhaps we could have a single cpu hotplug notifier in the percpu_counter
library.  Add register/deregister functions to the percpu_counter API so
that all percpu_counters in the machine can be linked together.
One _could_ just register and deregister the counters in
percpu_counter_init() and percpu_counter_destroy(), but perhaps that
wouldn't suit all callers, dunno.
