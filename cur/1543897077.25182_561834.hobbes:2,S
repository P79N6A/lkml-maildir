I think you are missing the point. You tell the kernel to
OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE. *over performance*. Sure. Performance shouldn't be
EXTREMELY pathetic, but it's not; and if it were, it's a problem with
the gcc version you have (and if you are a distro, you can surely fix
that)

on a system level, size can help performance because you have more
memory available for other things.  It also reduces download size and
gives you more space on the live CD....
if you want to make things bigger again, please do this OUTSIDE the
"optimize for size" option. Because that TELLS you to go for size.
