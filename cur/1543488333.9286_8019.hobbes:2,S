	It's fairly easy to implement, though. One line in
fs/namei.c::may_delete(), one line in fs/nfsd/vfs.c::nfsd_link(), pair of
#define's in fs.h and one more line in fs/ext2/inode.c::ext2_read_inode().
If somebody wants it I will include it into the next portion of VFS
cleanup that will be submitted to Linus - it obviously doesn't affect
anything else. Final decision belongs to Linus, indeed, but I think that
it's worth doing.
