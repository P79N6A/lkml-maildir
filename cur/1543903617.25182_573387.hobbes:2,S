These patches are coming from companies that aren't interested in
participating in the GPL process but are being forced into releasing
code because of the license. Some of them will go out of their way to
make the changes difficult to read. All of the patches I am looking at
come from embedded systems, many of these systems are still shipping
2.4 kernels.
Most of the patches contain junk, but there are occasional diamonds.
One I'm looking at contains code for accessing encryption hardware.
The goal is to look at the vendor diffs and see if I can spot anything
useful. Spotting something useful can be hard if there are 100,000
lines of noise in the diffs, I'm also trying to spot missing drivers
so that we can ask for more code.
