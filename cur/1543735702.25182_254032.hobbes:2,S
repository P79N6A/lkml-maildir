I already sent a reply to this, so you now know that I was wrong in describing 
the ordering issue as one of weak ordering, rather it's just supposed to be 
describing simple write posting.  Also, the first sample code is incorrect, 
since the second spinlock protected region has a read before a write and 
incorrectly states that the second write may arrive before the first.  I 
think Grant has some updates, if not I'll post a patch to fixup the doc.
Thanks,
Jesse
