Please note that *this* stuff was messed up before as well.
In esp using a CardBus ide adapter will give you after first
plug: /dev/hdc, after second plug /dev/hde and so on... on 2.4.17.
I'm just rying to clarify the code-flow before stuff like the above
can be cleaned up.
And please note that it certainly was and isn't a good idea
to call the module initialization routine twice. OK?
