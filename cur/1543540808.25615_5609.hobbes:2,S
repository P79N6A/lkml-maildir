It does not matter whether the distro runs "rmmod -a" or not.  What
matters is how the module was loaded.  rmmod -a only removes modules
that were autoloaded.  If you care about latency, disable kmod, it's a
killer.  Either use no modules or load them all on boot.  Without kmod,
rmmod -a is a no-op, unless you do a manual load and specify the -k
flag to explicitly mark a module as auto-clean (and why would you want
to?).
