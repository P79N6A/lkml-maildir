I am not sure what the point of these is? The userspace visibility of the
regular posix clocks (positive clockid's) does not change. The way we
encode process cputime clocks as negative values changes but there is
nothing that supports my encoding yet (apart from my test code) since
the glibc patch was never accepted.
I would like to keep the support for all 4 standard posix clocks through
clockids 0-3 as listed in the kernel headers and simply have the cputime
clocks redirect to your code appropriately to get the current values for
each process. IMHO that makes the interface cleaner, is cleaner for glibc
since it allows simply to pass positive clockids through  and also
maintains compatibility for positive clockids to the existing situation.
