Subject: Block device request merging - repeated requests.

I'm playing with a new block device driver in 2.3.41
When I try something simple like 
	'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mydevice bs=512 count=10'
 ... I find that the requests are helpfully merged.
Unfortunately, I find that they're also repeated.
So - what was ten separate write requests, for each consecutive block, now 
becomes ten write requests, each for the whole ten.
Am I doing something wrong - when I'm passed a request should I be checking it 
to see if it's already uptodate?
Or is the block request combining code in 2.3.41 completely shagged?
# dd if=nftl.c of=/dev/nftla bs=512 count=2 
2+0 records in
2+0 records out
NFTL_open called
NFTL write request of 0x2 sectors @ 0
Writing block 0 to EUN 5f
Writing block 1 to EUN 5a
NFTL write request completed OK
NFTL write request of 0x2 sectors @ 0
Writing block 0 to EUN 60
Writing block 1 to EUN 5b
NFTL write request completed OK
By setting max_sectors to 1 for the device in question, effectively disabling
the request merging, I return the system to sane behaviour.
