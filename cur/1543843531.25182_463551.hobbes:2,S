2.4 i386 by default resorts the list by what BIOS reports the order
should be.  No other arches do this.  So I'd expect it to be opposite
of what you say.
Care to send the output of 'lspci -tv' and the first 80 or so lines of
dmidecode?  This is curious.

Unfortunately, DMI data doesn't include enough information.  It says
"there's a port called NIC1", but doesn't say where to find it in PCI
space. :-(  I'm looking at ACPI 3.0 extensions, but am not finding
what I'm needing here either yet.
