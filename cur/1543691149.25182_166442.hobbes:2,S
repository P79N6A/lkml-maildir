On a 4 CPU machine the hash table is plenty large enough without the
extra attributes.  (Assuming 128 byte cache lines: 3072 bytes without
(24 cache lines); 32768 bytes with).
The extra cache lines might hurt a bit when all the threads run on a
single CPU, or on a HT, just because 32768 bytes is a lot more L1 than
3072 bytes.
