	Yes, while that'll let my module detect kernel incompatibilities,
it still doesn't solve the problem of building a module that can be
loaded into kernels that only differ in PAGE_OFFSET values. In other words
are there public symbols exported by the kernel, that I can use to derive
the value of PAGE_OFFSET for that kernel?
