I've just released Linux 2.6.20.18. It reverts two patches that
should not have been backported and which broke the build for at
least two persons. It also contains another confirmed fix from
2.6.22 for a problem reported in 2.6.20.17 by Michal Piotrowski.
This release is intended as a cleanup of 2.6.20.17, that's why it is so
small. BTW, 2.6.22-stable seems to be calming down. I will probably
release another 2.6.20.x later if some patches are relevant, and it
may be the last one if the patch rate in 2.6.22 stays low.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.20.17 and 2.6.20.18.
The patch and changelog will appear soon at the following locations:
