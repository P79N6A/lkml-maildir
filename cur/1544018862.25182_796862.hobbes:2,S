Thanks for your quick reply
BUT: I have tried those driver also
I tried this "brandnew" one (but also older ones)
http://home.eeti.com.tw/web20/drivers/touch_driver/Linux/2.06.2416/TouchKit-2.06.2410-32b-k26.tar.gz
after making it compile for 2.6.28.2 :)
since there is source code delivered
If I didnt make any error I get exactly the same error
maybe I did some error in the configuration but
it loads the tkusb kernel module instead of the usbtoucscreen
(which I added to the module blacklist) when plugin the screen
so I think I did it right :)
So maybe the problem is that the kernel is just too new 
and some other changes broke the support :)
So I will try with the kernel you are using
(2.6.17-8) to make sure
