Yeah cpusets is an interesting possibility. A per-inode attribute could be
another one. The good old global sysctl is also a must :)

I guess the main problem is those filesystems which dirty the page via
the buffers, via b_this_page, or b_data. However AFAIKS, these only happen
for things like directories. I _think_ we can safely assume that regular
file pages will not get modified (that would be data corruption!).

Hmm, OK. I'll have to do some stress testing. I'm sure there are a few bugs
left.

Yep.

I think that has merit. The problem if we remove __GFP_WAIT is that the
page allocator gives us access to some reserves. __GFP_NORETRY should
be reasonable?

Yeah, I told you it was ugly :P Sorry you had to wade through this, but
it can be cleaned up..

It is removed upstream, but in 2.6.20 it has no callers anyway so I didn't
worry about it.
Thanks for the comments & patch.
