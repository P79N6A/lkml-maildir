I wasn't actually the one that compiled the kernel (my SPARC 2 has so
little hard drive space that there's no room to install gcc with all
the trimmings), but I believe that Debian substitutes gcc with egcs.
On my i686 box, "gcc --version" reports egcs-2.91.66.  I would be very
surprised to hear that compiler choice matters.  I've also been told
by a couple people that they were able to solve this problem by either
getting a new drive or playing around with the cables and
termination.  Something somewhere in the new esp.c is probing
something that esp.c under 2.0.x didn't.
