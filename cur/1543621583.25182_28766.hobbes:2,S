Thank you for spotting this. Obviously there are times at night when it is 
even too late for simple search&replace like changes.
Also thanks for your comments on the busy-waiting loops. I stumbled 
across them, too, but decided to first do the uncontroversial time_before/
time_after fix. I think I'll do another run on this low-latency
(well, less-horrendous latency:-) stuff later.
