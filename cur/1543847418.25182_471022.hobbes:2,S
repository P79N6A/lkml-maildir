While I remember some discussion on the subject for 2.6, I don't
recall anything similiar in 2.4. Wouldn't you happen to build with
gcc-3.4 ? IIRC, the clobbering changed around this version. Could
you confirm that the patch you pointed above fixes the problem for
your case ?
Thanks in advance,
Willy
