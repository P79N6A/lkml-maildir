I keep getting the following kernel panic message over and over again:
scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:11, sector 2, absolute sector 34
SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 1 lun 0 return code = 28000002
extra data not valid Current error sd08:11: sense key Hardware Error
Additional sense indicates Internal target failure
Yet my system seems fine, the drive hasn't crashed and I haven't gotten any
weird filesystem errors. I was thinking of running fsck on all the
filesystems but the message indicates a physical error on the drive and
since fsck operates at the filesystem level I figured it would not be of
much use to do it. Can someone please help me! I want to avoid a crash if it
is imminent. This hard drive is for a live webserver.
