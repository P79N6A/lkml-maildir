Hi Kai, Sam
The following patch fixes the problem that localversion files where
ignored if the tree lives in a path which contains a ~. It changes the
test to apply to the filename only.
Debian allows versions which contains ~ in it. The upstream part of the
version is in the directory name of the build tree and we got weird
results because the localversion files was just got ignored in this
case.

Totally illogical, there was no chance.
