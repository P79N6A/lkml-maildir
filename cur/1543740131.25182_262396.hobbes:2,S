Linus, Andrew,
Here is an extreme attempt at preventing the fuckage known as including
linux/irq.h inappropriately.  Since people don't seem to get the message,
the only option is to remove the bloody file.
Shame this breaks everyone using the generic IRQ infrastructure, but I
see no other option to educate people.
Maybe someone can add it back as linux/include/asm-generic/irq.h, which
is where it should've been in the first place.
