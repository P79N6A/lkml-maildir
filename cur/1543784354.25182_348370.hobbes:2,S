More information:
The error only occurrs during device sensing when the
srb->request_buffer is assigned as follows, by usb/storage/transport.c
in the routine usb_stor_invoke_transport:
old_request_buffer = srb->request_buffer;
srb->request_buffer = srb->sense_buffer;
Now, this is a problem because srb->sense_buffer is defined as follows
in the struct scsi_cmnd:
#define SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE   96
        unsigned char sense_buffer[SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE];
Since it is not allocated at runtime there is NO WAY the SCSI layer
can possibly guarantee it is page- or cache-aligned and ready for DMA.
Any suggestions on best fix for this?  Is it still a SCSI-layer issue?
 Or should USB step up in this case and ensure this buffer is dma-safe
itself?
