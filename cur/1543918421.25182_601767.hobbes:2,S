It still gives us a target time, so could we not simply have sched_yield 
put the thread completely to sleep for the given amount of time? It 
wholly redefines the operation, and its far more expensive (now there's 
a whole new timer involved) but it might emulate the expected behavior. 
Its hideous, but so is sched_yield in the first place, so why not?
