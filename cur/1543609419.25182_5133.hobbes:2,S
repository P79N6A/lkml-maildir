I know, but Andrea suggested not to allow scheduling of disabled tasklets
Also, enableing the tasklet will result in a scheduled tasklet, regardless
whether it was scheduled. Plus, we are not sure if it is scheduled on the
same cpu that did the tasklet_schedule (but i might be the only one who
cares about this  ;)

tasklets.
