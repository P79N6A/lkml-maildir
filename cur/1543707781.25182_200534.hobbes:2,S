Well, I was picturing all those *_dma_supported() functions as being 
plugged into (new) fields in struct bus_type:
	struct bus_type {
		...
		int (*dma_supported)(struct device *dev, u64 mask);
	}
If your *_dma_supported functions only take usb_dev, pci_dev, etc, then 
you end up with code like asm-generic/dma-mapping.h:
	int dma_supported(struct device *dev, u64 mask)
	{
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI
		if (dev->bus == pci_bus_type)
			return pci_dma_supported(to_pci_dev(dev), mask);
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_ISA
		if (dev->bus == isa_bus_type)
			return isa_dma_supported(to_isa_dev(dev), mask);
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_BRANDNEWSUPERBUS
		if (dev->bus == brandnewsuper_bus_type)
			return brandnewsuper_dma_supported(to_brandnewsuper_dev(dev), mask);
#endif
		... list every possible bus type here ...
	}
That just seems silly to me, when you can dispatch through a 
bus_type->dma_supported() function pointer.
