I pulled from the softmac-2.6.git tree.  I think there was ieee80211
stuff in there as well, but you probably know better than I do. :-)
The history in your tree isn't formatted properly for the kernel,
so something would have to be done before that went upstream anyway.
I think it would be best for you to post the patches to netdev,
including patches covering softmac if you are so inclined.  Please be
sure to follow kernel patch posting conventions:
