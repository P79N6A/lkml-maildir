Hi Ingo,
  Please apply.
  This series of patches fixes build breakage on arch/powerpc with realtime
preempt patch.  This applies on top of linux-2.6.20 and patch-2.6.20-rt8.
  Although there has been some efforts to port realtime-preempt patch to
powerpc, build breakage still exists for powerpc (esp. 64bit architecture).
  I'll also post these pathes later at CE Linux Forum's wiki page at;

  Comments and suggestions are welcome.
  Thanks in advance.
