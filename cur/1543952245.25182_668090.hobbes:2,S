Richard, any ideas for that?  It *is* still time to change this for 2.6.25,
if required.  If you changed it once already, changing it again won't cause
further damage.
I need to know if the current naming scheme will hold or not, I do NOT want
an ABI issue on thinkpad-acpi, and I know for a fact at least Debian will
want to use the thinkpad-acpi LED interface as soon as I deploy it.  I want
to send the thinkpad-acpi LED interface patches to the users as soon as
possible.
Sincerely?  I think you should make it <function>:[color][.instance] and
drop device name compleley, ASAP.
I will write the patches for mainline and your for-mm branch, if that would
speed up things.  But I need to know what you have decided, first.
