Yes, but the global counter is modified with a lock in the SMP case, and the
local counters are modified by their respective cpus only,  Although there 
might be more subtle issues .....

I thought the solution to this was to have a global unsigned counter, and
signed local counter, and defer updates to the global if it is going to be a 
large value due to the case above. This way the global counter remains an up 
counter no?
