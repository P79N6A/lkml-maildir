I wouldna spotted that in a million years.  That all_zones_ok code was a
bitch to test and really needs retesting.
We used to have <= in there actually:
		to_reclaim = zone->pages_high-zone->free_pages;
		if (to_reclaim <= 0)
			continue;
We've never clearly defined whether pages_high == free_pages means the zone
is under limits.  According to __alloc_pages() it means that the zone is
not under limits, so you've fixed two bugs there.
