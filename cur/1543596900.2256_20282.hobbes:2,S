    It's the unix semantics of readdir(); e.g. specified in Single Unix:
    ``   The type DIR, which is defined in the header <dirent.h>, represents
         a directory stream, which is an ordered sequence of all the
         directory entries in a particular directory. Directory entries
         represent files; files may be removed from a directory or added to
         a directory asynchronously to the operation of readdir(). ''
    An ordered sequence does not include cycles.
*Who* says NFS has to be a *unix* like filesystem?
