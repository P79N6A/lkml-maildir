HOW DO YOU GET TO THE CONFIG SPACE IN THE FIRST PLACE?
The reason mmconfig is *BROKEN*CRAP* is that you cannot bootstrap it. 
There's no standard way to even figure out WHERE IT IS!
So we depend on firmware tables that are known to be broken!
That crap should be seen for the crap it is! Dammit, how hard can it be to 
just admit that mmconfig isn't that great?
