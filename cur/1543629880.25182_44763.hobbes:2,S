hi Ho :-),
at first, i'm sorry, abaut my terrible english.
i wan't to use the framebuffer support with the 2.5.x kernel and a 
sis630 chipset (the integrated notebook-chipset). it only works with 
kernel >= 2.4.18-ac1. i only want to know: will the patch from the ac 
kernel added to 2.5.x or must i use vesa ?
thx
patrick
