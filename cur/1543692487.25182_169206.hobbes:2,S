Sorry, a late comer, as always: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/29/152
Seen it. Tested it. Solved it.
Thanks.
BTW, we cannot find the reason for the synaptics timeouts:
Synaptics driver lost sync at 4th byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver resynced.
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver resynced.
which are the only glitches I find to it.
