Subject: [PATCH] use printk.time option, drop time/notime
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Andrew, please drop add-notime-boot-option.patch
and use this patch instead...
Allow printk_time to be enabled or disabled at boot time.
Previously it could be enabled only, but not disabled.
Change printk_time from an int to a bool since that's what it is.
Make its logical (exposed) name just be "time" (was "printk_time").
Note:  Changes kernel boot option syntax from "time" to "printk.time=value".
Since printk_time is declared as a module_param, it can also be
changed at run-time by modifying
  /sys/module/printk/parameters/time
to a value of 1/Y/y to enabled it or 0/N/n to disable it.
Since printk_time is declared as a module_param, its value can also
be set at boot-time by using
  linux printk.time=<bool>
Drop the "time" boot option and its __setup() functions.
