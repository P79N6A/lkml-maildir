SYMPTOMS:
The current Moxa Intellio driver (moxa.c) panics when using > 1 board.
BACKGROUND:
The Moxa board needs a firmware download (see
http://www.moxa.com/drivers/C320T/Linux/v5.4/MXDRV.TGZ,
 command
moxaload -y) prior to usage.
Unfortunately, the current Linux kernel code fails during this download if
more than one board are installed.
EXPLANATION AND FIX:
The MoxaDriverPoll function does:
[...]
        for (card = 0; card < MAX_BOARDS; card++) {
                if ((ports = moxa_boards[card].numPorts) == 0)
                        continue;
                if (readb(moxaIntPend[card]) == 0xff) {
[...]
Unfortunately, with multiple boards, there exists a point where
MoxaDriverPoll() will be called when moxa_boards[card].numPorts != 0 but
moxaIntPend[card] is still NULL. Result: kernel panic.
Fix: use instead
                if ((ports = moxa_boards[card].numPorts) == 0
                    || moxaIntPend[card] == 0)
                        continue;
If someone who understands the code better than me proposes a better
patch, I'd be delighted. [For the little story, the above patch was
written after finding the bug in a remote location without internet access
using a serial console for getting the panic trace...]
