I can change the find_first_bit to use __builtin_ffs, but how would you
implement the ffz?  The clz and ctz only count the number of leading or
trailing zeros respectively, it doesn't find the first zero. Of course a
__builtin_ctz(~x) would but this might take longer than what we already
have.  I'll go ahead and try it and see.  But I still don't have a
decent benchmark on this. I'll start looking into the kernel and see how
it's used, and see if I can find a proper benchmark.
