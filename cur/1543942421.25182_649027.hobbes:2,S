This is due to current separation into files. hardware.c has many functions 
for handler bodies, while main.c registers the pcmcia structs in module init 
(and takes address of ipwireless_interrupt()). Long ago, the driver was one 
large file, and I don't want to merge the files back just to make some funcs 
static (and make the sources less readable).

Same reason, the macro would be used in a file where the struct is not yet 
defined.

Sounds reasonable. I personally haven't used this param (besides testing the 
code) and don't know of any related problems.

Removed. Used only in one place.
Thanks for comments. Updated version 5 will follow.
