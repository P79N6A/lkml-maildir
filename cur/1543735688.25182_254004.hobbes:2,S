You can pin just a directory and retrieve all of the events therein.
You do not need to pin every single inode on your machine.  This is the
same as dnotify - except inotify also allows you to watch individual
files.

If you cannot track the lifecycle of the object being watched, you
essentially cannot watch it.  To track the lifetime of an inode, you
need to ensure that it remains in the icache.

John showed that the absolute worst case is ~30MB in your icache.  I
have 77MB of ext3 inodes in cache right now on my desktop.  Assuming a
decent overlap between watched and cached inodes, there is little
change.
But the 30MB is worst case.  Expect something in the single digits.
Look, Bill: Conjecturing about a potential problem in a space you are
unfamiliar with does nothing but obstruct Linux development and act as
Stop Energy.  Constructive, well-informed opinions are money.
Everything else is just liking the sound of your voice.
Thanks!
