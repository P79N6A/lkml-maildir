Sure, particularly sysfs as "the next big thing" is a good reason
to align data structures and general semantics with the rest of
the stack.
The only thing that worries me in all this is Dave's request to
make device destruction asynchronous, because of the complexity
this is likely to add, for, IMHO, little or no gain.
