For reference, the default behaviour for Linux/ext2 is the above,
except that if you mount the filesystem with -o bsdgroups, OR you
set the sgid bit on the parent directory, in which cases it 
inherits the parent directory's GID.  (The sgid bit for the directory
is also inherited by subdirectories, so by setting this bit you can
make the entire subdirectory tree default to inheriting the same
GID.)
