the fallback in gettimeofday which may be needed in some system would
require a syscall instruction at fixed address too indeed (however in
most systems that is not necessary so the uml fallback seems to be the
one inserting the syscall instruction in common hardware).

agreed.
And if they really want to relocate the vsyscall page, it's possible to
implement with a new syscall without having to slowdown or change the
API. We simply need to change the pte during context switch, but it will
force some invlpg at every context switch. I agree it doesn't worth as
far as the executable is the same on all systems.
