The best approach I found (for my purposes anyway) was the one used by the
ALSA OSS emulator (and strace as well?) that uses weak & strong symbols in a
pre-loaded shared library to intercept system calls to the device I wanted
to handle in user space.
I'd be surprised if this technique was suitable as a generic approach.
