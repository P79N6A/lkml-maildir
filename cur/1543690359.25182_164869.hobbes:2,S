agreed.

btw, so far we were only discussing IPC in a local box (UP or SMP or
NUMA) w/o networking involved. Luca's currnet implementation as well was
only working locally.

if you can avoid to enter kernel, you'd better do that, because entering
kernel will take much more time than the copy itself.
with the shm/futex approch you can also have a ring buffer to handle
parallelism better while it's at the same time zerocopy and enterely
userspace based in the best case (thought that's not the common case).
thanks,
