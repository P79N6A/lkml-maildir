I have a similar situation. We don't build the card, but we are reliably
informed that the card shouldn't need any strange magic to persuade it to
generate interrupts. I didn't believe them until I saw your message, and now
I'm not so sure.
If I initialise the card under NT and soft-reboot into Linux, then I get 
interrupts from it. Otherwise I have to make it share interrupts with 
the network card, and flood ping something to get my drivers to work :)
Adding an 'enable_irq(irq)' after registering the IRQ provokes the kernel into 
saying "enable_irq() unbalanced from 00000009", but doesn't actually make it 
work.
