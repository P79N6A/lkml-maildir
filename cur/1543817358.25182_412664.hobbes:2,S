Ok.  That make sense.  The fact that some of the security modules
besides selinux are tristate in Kconfig had me confused for a moment.
Controlling what to run with a kernel command line makes sense
then.
Having a generic command line like lsm=[selinux|root_plug|capability|seclvl]
would be nice.  Where nothing supplied would not enable any of
the linux security modules.
