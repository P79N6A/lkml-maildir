Hi!
This patch is a quick port of my 2.4.x ASFS driver. It adds read-only
support for Amiga SmartFileSystem. This filesystem is being used very
commonly on AmigaOS and MorphOS systems. This patch has been tested on
Linux/x86 machine. This patch is prepared for kernel 2.6.0test5.
The patch is available on
http://www.staszic.waw.pl/~march/asfs/asfs-0.6_patch_2.6.0t5.diff
(because of the size, it has over 1000 lines).
Regards
