Technically speaking, however, the completion of a request that was
taken from the read list doesn't guarantee that there are still free
slots in the read list, but rather that there *were* free slots in the
read list at the time the request was made.
If between that time and now a slew of requests were made, enough to use
all available requests, plus one more read for the sake of argument,
which will be put onto the wait queue.  Now this new free request is put
onto the read free_list, but the queue is not activated.  Then another
read request comes in, it will use the free request while the one on the
wait queue starves.  
In fact, the requests that are going to go back onto the read free_list
when they are complete, at this point, will be the oldest ones, since
'back then' there was still room in the read free_list.  Since they are
oldest, they are also probably going to be the first to be completed. 
So that means that you have potentially (pathological but possible) the
entire read_list free, with a reader waiting on the queue for a free
request.  Of course new readers will continue happily, but the waiting
one will be starved until your quota of batched write request freeing
completes and the queue is activated.
