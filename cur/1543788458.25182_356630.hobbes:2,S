Hi,
In 2.4, we have structures like clean_pages to organize various cached
file data. But in 2.6, these structures disappeared. So how to
determine whether a file data block exists in cache? Can someone
kindly give me a brief description and point me to the right function
or linux source code file? Many thanks!
