Eric,
After enabling curses and tkinter in python [which is not
something that "normal users" will want to be doing BTW/IMO*],
I can now do some real testing, so here is some feedback
for you.  I'm using cml2 0.7.2.
1. In curses mode, I think that you should reverse
the meanings of 'q' and 'x' (a la vi).
2. Command line options for cmlconfigure:
Any options that take a file name should (or should not)
consistently have an intervening space between the
option and file name.  I don't care which way it is,
just be consistent, please.
[-o filename -h filename -s filename,
but -ifilename -Ifilename]
I'll give you some feedback on USB configuration later.
~Randy
*: Normal users will probably want curses and tkinter options
enabled, but all that they should have to do is install
python, not do special configs of it.
BTW, don't read too much into this.  I'm not pushing for
python support/usage; I'm just evaluating and giving feedback
on CML2 and its implementation.
