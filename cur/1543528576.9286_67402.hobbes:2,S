I think your patch is at least half right. The one thing I wonder about is
whether a user (not kernel hacker) would understand why his MSP3400 audio
doesn't work when he/she does a "modprobe sb" (or enables sound via a gui
app), when his distribution-vendor decided to compile MSP3400 into the 
kernel. Several vendors say "Y" to a lot of Config questions, except for 
things that pose a risk (certain SCSI adaptors, sound, network-drivers etc).
The ultimate solution would, of course, be that the MSP driver registers
itself when the sound-modules are insmod'ed into the kernel, but that is
somewhat of a technical chalenge.
