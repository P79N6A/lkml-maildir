The above makes no sense. The notion of "memory is written" is a true
superset of the "memory is read", and must be a complete memory barrier
(ie telling the compiler that "we read memory" is non-sensical: it can't
give the compiler any more information).
Because the memory clobber doesn't tell _what_ memory is clobbered, you
cannot consider memory dead after the instruction. As such, the compiler
HAS to treat a clobber as a "read-modify-write" - because on a very
fundamental level it _is_. Clobbering memory is logically 100% equivalent
to reading all of memory, modifying some of it, and writing the modified
information back.
(This is different from a "clobber specific register" thing, btw, where
the compiler can honestly assuem that the register is dead after the
instruction and contains no useful data. That is a write-only dependency,
and means that gcc can validly use optimization techniques like removing
previous dead writes to the register.)
See? Do you see why a "memory" clobber is _not_ comparable to a "ax"
clobber? And why that non-comparability makes a memory clobber equivalent
to a read-modify-write cycle?
In short: I disagree 100%. A "memory" clobber -does- effectively tell the
compiler that memory is read. If the compiler doesn't realize that, then
it's a compiler bug waiting to happen. No ifs, buts of maybes.
