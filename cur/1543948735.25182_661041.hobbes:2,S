This is fixed in recent kernels (commit
3d82abae9523c33d4a16fdfdfd2bdde316d7b56a, to be precise). The windows
driver is corrupting the filesystem but ext3 shouldn't BUG and if you
update to a recent kernel it won't. If you can't update then you
should e2fsck the filesystem after using the windows driver. That
should fix up the corruption.
Also, for future reference, LKML folks generally don't like
attachments, so if possible just include logs or other info inline
next time.
