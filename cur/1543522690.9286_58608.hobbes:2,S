Hi,
> The same setup compiles fine in 2.2.15pre2:
2.2.15pre3 includes quite a number of fixes to the QNX filesystem, but
so far I've only fixed reading; writing to a QNX partition is still
broken.
At this time, please DO NOT enable QNX write-support when configuring
the kernel as any attempt to actually write something is certain to
damage your QNX partition!
This is true for 2.3.x as well.
I still need a couple of weeks to get it right, please be patient.
cheers
  Anders
