No, I do not want EV_ACPI at all. If it does not map to standard
key/button/switch abstraction it really does not belong in input
layer. There could be a "battery" or "power" layers providing
abstraction for ACPI/APM/whateverfor that kind of stuff, but not input
layer.
But KEY_SLEEP, KEY_POWER, etc are more than welcome.
