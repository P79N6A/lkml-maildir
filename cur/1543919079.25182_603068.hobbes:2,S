The tight memory restrictions on stack usage do not come about because
of the difficulty in increasing the stack size :) It is because we want to
keep stack sizes small!
Increasing the stack size 4K uses another 4MB of memory for every 1000
threads you have, right?
It would take a lot of good reason to move away from the general direction
we've been taking over the past years that 4/8K stacks are a good idea for
regular 32 and 64 bit builds in general.

The solution has until now always been to fix the problems so they don't
use so much stack. Maybe a bigger stack is OK for you for 1024+ CPU
systems, but I don't think you'd be able to make that assumption for most
normal systems.
