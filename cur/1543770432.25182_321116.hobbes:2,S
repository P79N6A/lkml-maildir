Subject: Resend: PATCH: Stop 2.6.12rc rmmod from being able to destroy CD hardware

On an rmmod the cdrom layer when used with ide-cd issues a cache flush
atapi command to devices including those that do not support it.
According to Jens earlier discussion this isn't merely a minor glitch
but can destroy some CD hardware due to firmware bugs in the drive (as
per the Mandrake incident)
The IDE CD layer uses a mask of unsupported features, this means that
because ide-cd doesn't know about MRW writables it doesn't set the
relevant bit for non writables and harm can occur.
The simple fix is attached, making the driver start from ~0 and mask
bits the other direction would longer term be safer.
