No, I suspect it's just related to timing: you need to hit that window 
when the LIST_FROZEN bit is set, and since it was so reliable for you 
before (and others didn't see it), your timing probably happened to hit it 
exactly. And changing HZ probably just changed some timeout or softirq 
getting called, and you didn't hit the bug any more.
