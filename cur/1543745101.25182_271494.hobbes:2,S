The box has locked up and I would like to know if there's a way around it.

Let's *do* assume that some module's algorithm is not perfect, and further
assume that ATM, it's in an endless loop. Moreover, editing the module's source
is not an option.
This is not a homework or something, it's real. And I do not know where it's
hanging. Sure, SYSRQ+P would tell me where, but that could get hard to track if
it's the Nth stack frame (seen from the inner-most) for big N.
So for the moment to keep downtimes small, best option would be to have
something to circumvent the blocker process. E.g. putting it to sleep and
(then, finally, when I regain control) poke with the module's/kernel's source.
I've generalized the case into the above-mentioned for(;;); because that's the
worst case for uniprocessors, and I think it's best to start tackling there.
