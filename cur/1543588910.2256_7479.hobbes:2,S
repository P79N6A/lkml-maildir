	Oups ! Big mea culpa ! Apologies.
	While trying to compile my kernel, I've just realised the the
patch I've downloaded wasn't complete. My browser cut it in the middle
claiming that it was 100% complete.
	Downloaded the patch again (patch-2.4.4-pre6), checked that it
was complete, my patch is in. Oups ! Do I feel stupid...
	Apologies to everybody... Sorry for the confusion...
	Jean
