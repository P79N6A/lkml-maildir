Jeff, you misunderstand me.  I *DO* agree with you.  I *DO*
believe that it is a courtesy to get the fix out first.  When
nobody WANTS the fix however and there are CLOSED EYES AND EARS,
though, then the courtesy goes like this:
1) Kind sir, I noticed a flaw here.
2) Up yours!  No flaw exists.
1) But sir, you don't understand.  There is one, and I want to
try and help fix it.
2) No, you are wrong jerk.  Go away.
1) Fine!  I don't care then.  You aren't going to listen
obviously regardless of how hard I try to explain, so I must now
show the flaw to the world NOW instead of LATER which is how I
planned on doing it.
2) What??  You can't do that!  You should have given me time to
prepare!  That is not courteous.
1) HUH?????  What do you call step #1 way above...
So, sorry if you misunderstand me, but really, we agree. Perhaps
we disagree on the events that have occured up til now though and
what they mean..
Please call me "Mike" Jeff.  No need to resort to pseudo name
attack..  Mike is fine.
