There are different things to protect. E.g. i_sem is (ab)used for dcache
race-prevention. Lumping everything together is not a good idea, IMO.

Wait a minute. It's exactly the reason why we should not do it in
sys_write() - synchronization issues vary depending on _what_ you are
accessing.

broken so badly, that... well, for example there is a nice race with
mmap(). There is a whole crapload of horror in the implementation - I have
some fixes, but they are pretty obsolete now (late July; I was net.dead
in August and beginning of September ;-/). And there is an interesting
stuff in interaction of fs/locks.c with fs/lockd/*. If NFS folks are ready
to comment on their side of code - fine, but IMHO the locking stuff is
not going to be fixed soon.
