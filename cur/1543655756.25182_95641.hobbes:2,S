It is. Its a nice CPU for appliances. FPU is nondescript, integer
performance is sort of the same as an equivalently clocked celewrong for
the current Ezra core at least. The older Samuel II core seems a little
slower.
There is also a subspecies that comes in at 500-600MHz and is designed
for low power fanless operation (though with a decent sized heatsink the
same is true for the 1GHz ones).
If you think the Walmart PC is cool take a look at the EPIA board or see
