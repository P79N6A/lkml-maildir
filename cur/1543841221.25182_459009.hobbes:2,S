The problem remains in 2.6.18-rc5.
The workaround people have suggested (using alsactl -F restore) works if 
I have a working /etc/asound.state created with a 2.6.17 kernel. If I 
was starting from scratch with 2.6.18-rc5 I would have no way to set the 
sound level for the digital output. But maybe the bug is in alsamixer 
and alsactl?
