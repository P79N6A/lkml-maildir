Sorry, I'm a bit rusty with gnuplot. Color charts are updated with the
same url.  On the last one, I was trying to plot same CPU type with same
color but different line weight for each kernel, 
plot "data" using 1:2 title "2P Xeon 3.4 GHz - vanilla" with linespoints lt 1 lw 10, \
     "data" using 1:3 title "2P Xeon 3.4 GHz - lockless" with linespoints lt 1 lw 1
gnuplot gives me the same color on both plotted lines, but the line weight
argument doesn't have any effect.  I looked for examples everywhere on the
web with no avail.  I must be missing some argument somewhere that I can't
figure out right now :-(
