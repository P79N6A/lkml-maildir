Hi Ingo,
It still locks up hard for me when voluntary-preempt=3, however it does
finish the boot; dmesg attached. The lockup occurs several minutes into
use; usually by by the time I've started X, launched evolution and
selected my first imap folder the machine's dead.
If you need more information or want me to try some patches, just let me
know.
BTW, do you intent on keeping the preempt-smp patch alive?
