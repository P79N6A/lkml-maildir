Hi,
I am looking at posix record locking with nfs and I have a couple of 
questions:
1. The fcntl_setlk() calls nfs_lock() (towards the end of fcntl_setlk by 
calling filp->f_op->lock), fcntl_setlk() then calls posix_lock_file() 
(where all the vfs magic happens for file locks).  If nfs_lock() returns 
successful (server has granted the lock) but the subsequent 
posix_lock_file() fails (due to deadlock, conflict or low memory), we 
never go back to the server to clean up this lock.  Is this a problem or 
am I missing something?
2. nfs_lock() calls nlmclnt_proc() after we pick up the kernel lock 
(lock_kernel()).  The nlmclnt_proc() goes on to call:
   nlmclnt_lock()
   nlmclnt_call()
   rpc...
Is this OK?  Are we going over the wire while holding the kernel lock?
Best Regards,
Moiz
