Yes, but you can't mix&match anyway. For stuff like that you're
probably best off by using a talktokernel.c file that is
compiled with -I/path/to/kernel/include while the rest of the
daemon doesn't know about kernel internals.
That could and perhaps should be fixed, but I think that is
a different issue entirely.
Mike.
