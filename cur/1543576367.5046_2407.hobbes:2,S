It is easy:
  int mfd;
  volatile unsigned long* memory;
  int i;
  mfd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR);
  memory = mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, mfd, 0x000B8000);
  close(mfd); 
  for (i = 0; i < 0x1300 * 1000; i++) {
    *memory = i;
    *memory;
  }
  munmap(memory, 4096);
/usr/bin/time says that program runs for 3.40 - 3.56secs, so after dividing
by 1000 I get 3.4ms... Maybe I should complain to VIA or to Matrox that
it is piece of crap ?

My order was simple: no rambus memory, dual PIII at least on 800MHz
and UDMA66. Yes, maybe I should buy ServerWorks instead of VIA, but 
I hoped...
