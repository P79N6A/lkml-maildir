I dont' think what you actually want is changing the id table - after all, 
it's only walked when registering the driver (+ hotplug).
What you really want is a way to call the drivers' probe routine for a 
device which isn't in its tables.
So why not simply
echo "0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000" > .../3c59x/probe
It shares one caveat with the approach above, i.e. struct pci_device_id
has a field called "unsigned long driver_data", and as such is really hard
to fill from userspace. I think in the common case it's not used and can
be just set to zero, but if the driver e.g. expects it to point to a
driver-private structure describing the device, you lose.
And you need one more thing, i.e. the ability to load a driver without
hardware being present. E.g. pci_module_init() is supposed to return
-ENODEV when modular and no hardware is found. Actually, it doesn't
anymore, since someone (I think you, Pat ;) broke it.
