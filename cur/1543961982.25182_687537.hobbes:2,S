Ingo, there are areas in the kernel you know well.
But kconfig is not among them.
This breakage with your .config is *not* caused by an input bug as you 
wrongly claim (I'll send a correct fix after some testing).
And the commit that broke it even contains a
  Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
I would really appreciate it if you could send the error message and the 
.config but not quick kconfig patches that are often wrong and that you 
try to push through the maintainers as you tried here.
Toralf, who does randconfig testing for some years, does exactly this, 
and the maintainers and/or I usually pick up his bug reports and work on
getting them fixed properly.
