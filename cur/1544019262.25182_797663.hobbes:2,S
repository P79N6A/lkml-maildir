Indeed, the INUSE stuff looks vestigial and can probably be removed.

This is one of those things that just keeps changing. Once upon a
time I'd write code with CPU hotplug triggers and such and someone
would always come through to change them to for_each_possible_cpu
in the name of simplification :)
But yeah I personally still prefer the hotplug way, so no objections
from me.
Thanks for reviewing Andrew!
