It's the fall-through case, where the table is not used.
         /* No error?  Undecoded? */
         printk(KERN_WARNING "ata%u: no sense translation for op=0x%02x status: 0x%02x\n",
                id, opcode, drv_stat);
         /* For our last chance pick, use medium read error because
          * it's much more common than an ATA drive telling you a write
          * has failed.
          */
         *sk = MEDIUM_ERROR;
         *asc = 0x11; /* "unrecovered read error" */
         *ascq = 0x04; /*  "auto-reallocation failed" */
