Thanks a lot for your interest!
I'll clean it up and resend it later. As I don't have the necessary
knowledge to do the tsc_{32,64}.c unification, should I copy paste
common functions into tsc_32.c and tsc_64.c to ease later unification
or should I start a common .c file?
Thanks again for showing interest.
