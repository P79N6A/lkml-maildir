Just wanted to thank you for solving the above problem, where a 3com pcmcia card
failed on an older laptop.
I saw in the 2.6.13-rc6 log that some work on yenta and PCI had been done. So I
tried kernel 2.6.12-1.1456_FC5 from the Fedora development repository, and I got
it to work but only with the irqpoll option (details including dmesg output at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=163952
).
Excellent work!
Jean-Luc
