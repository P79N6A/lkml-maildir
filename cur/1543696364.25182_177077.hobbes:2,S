The BitKeeper source tree looks like
	BitKeeper/  SCCS/  doc/  man/  src/
I have a repository where it looks like
	 src/  BitKeeper/  PENDING/  RELEASE-NOTES  SCCS/  doc/  man/  src/
That first src/ is actually " src/" and it has some rather strange behaviour.
It's a different directory inode than "src/" but if I create a file in " src/"
it shows up in "src/" and vice versa.
Hey, neato, it gets weirder.  I went to go run an example and now most of
the files in " src/" are gone, most but not all.
I'm merrily backing up this disk while I can but if this rings any bells
someone let me know.  Thanks.
