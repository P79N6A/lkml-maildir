Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
These patches are updated version of 'del_timer_sync: proof of concept'
2 patches.
1/5:
	unchanded.
2/5:
	del_timer_sync() simplified. It is not neccessary to unlock and
	retry if __TIMER_PENDING has changed, it is only neccessary if
	timer's base == (timer->_base & ~1) has changed. Also, comments
	are updated.
3/5:
	The reworked del_timer_sync() can't work unless timers are
	serialized wrt to itself. They are not.
	I missed the fact that __mod_timer() can change timer's base
	while the timer is running.
4/5:
	remove memory barrier in __run_timers() and del_timer().
5/5:
	kill ugly __get_base(), it was temporal.
The del_singleshot_timer_sync function now unneeded, but it looks like
additional test for del_timer_sync(), so it will be removed later.
Btw, add_timer_on() is racy against __mod_timer(), is it worth fixing?
Oleg.
