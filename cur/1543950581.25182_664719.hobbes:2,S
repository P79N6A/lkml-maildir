That's correct

Yes, us too ... you just have to error all commands when the device
vanishes.

This is the problem case: driver unloading should have a
scsi_remove_host() in its path.  This is the trigger that sends out the
flushes/stops and calls slave_destroy.  scsi_remove_host() doesn't
actually return until all the destroys are completed, so it makes module
unloading wait until everything is properly shut down.

You have a sysfs flag to prevent that, don't you?
