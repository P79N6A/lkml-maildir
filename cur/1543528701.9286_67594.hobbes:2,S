Do you really need to track devices using inode numbers? Why not use
the info pointer to <devfs_register>, which will be written to
file->private_data upon open of the device. You can encode a 32 bit
number here, or have a pointer to a device instance structure.
IMO this is far neater than using device/inode numbers.
Please consider this approach. Contact me off-list if you're
interested in pursuing it. Unless there's something really different
about USB (I don't think there is: it just happens to really require
dynamic device support), it should work very cleanly with devfs. After
all, one of the design goals of devfs was to at last make hot-plug
devices work properly.
