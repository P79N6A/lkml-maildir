Good gods, no.  The best mnemonics for P() and V() I've ever seen
were in the Amiga which called them Procure() and Vacate(), but the
names still suck mightily.

Ah, now we get to the valid point.

Well, a mutex can detect it immediately, rather than via a timeout,
but that's a matter of a few seconds, and the vast majority of the
evidence you want is frozen by the deadlock itself.

Agreed.  Maybe someone will someday find an application where there's
really no way around it, but avoiding the need is generally better
design.

An excellent point.  As long as it's only used for post-mortem debugging,
and not to verify invariants at run-time, you can keep track of
"who would be the woner if this were a mutex".

Let's go through what you lose if you give up a known lock owner and
just use something probabilistic....
Detecting deadlocks - can be done immediately and definitively with
a lock owner, and only via timeouts without.  Still, not a deal-breaker.
Multi-lock deadlocks - same, although the detection code is
more complex so probably shouldn't be enabled all the time.
Double-release: can be instantly detected with a known mutex, but will
produce really odd misbehaviour with a semaphore.  Still, you're quite
right that failing to release on a failure path is by far the more
common bug.
Priority inheritance.  This is the original reason that the -rt patch
implemented mutexes, and requires accurate lock owner information.
Not having it is a show-stopper here.
Source documentation.  This is more a style thing, but I really
like putting as much information into the source as possible.
(If comments worked, we wouldn't need sparse.)  
So the latter two are the only really good reasons.  Still, I think
they're persuasive.
Can anyone think of any other benefits?
