If we are talking about memmory bload. Let's usk a question. Is somebody
there
working seriously on changing the default function call conventions on
IA32
from stack parameter pushing to register passing throughout the
kernel? The implications on in esp. the I-cache pressure seem to be
quite significant and apparently one of there areas where the GCC got
much better is precisely this. The recent comparisions of gcc against
the intel compiler show as well that this may be really worth it.
