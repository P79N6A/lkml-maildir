Changes from 2.6.14-ck8
Added:
 +2.6.15-dynticks-060101.patch
 +dynticks-disable_smp_config.patch
Latest version of the dynticks patch. This is proving stable and effective on 
virtually all uniprocessor machines and will benefit systems that desire 
power savings. SMP kernels (even on UP machines) still misbehave so this 
config option is not available by default for this stable kernel.
Removed:
 -smp-nice-support7.diff
SMP Nice support is now merged in the mainline kernel
 -patch-2.6.14.5.bz2
