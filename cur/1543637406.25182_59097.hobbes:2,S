Hmm. The index really should be unsigned, but obviously there could be
sign errors.
The stupid BSD approach of putting metadata in negative offsets is just
that - stupid. Under Linux the people who do that just have another
address space for metadata.
Your PAGE_CACHE_SIZE vs PAGE_SIZE thing is true, but separating the two
out is going to be less than pleasant in practice, methinks.
