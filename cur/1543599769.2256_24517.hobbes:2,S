   That isnt done anyway - the card executes a risc instruction set for the
   DMA engine specifying which to skip and draw. So you feed it a base
   physical address for the fb via ioctl (yes this needs to be a pci device
   bar and offset I suspect) and then tell it about the fb layout and the like
We could do something interesting with /proc/bus/pci/bus/devfn nodes
I suspect.
You open the target fb pci dev, and part of the argument to the video
ioctl is:
	int pci_dev_fd;
	int resource_num;
	u64 offset;
	u64 len;
Something like that.
