Backuping target memory before kexec and restoring it after kexec is
planed feature for kexec jump. But I will work on image writing/reading
first.

There is many free spaces in jump_buf_pfn page now. I think passing the
needed information through jump_buf_pfn is more convenient than through
kernel command line. That is, the jump_buf_pfn can be seen as a meta
interface, which is passed to kexeced kernel though command line, while
other information can be passed though jmp_buf_pfn.

If the "scatter copy" is replaced by "scatter swap", we need not the
inverse list, and the state of kexeced kernel can be backuped too. There
are "scatter copy" support in normal kexec implementation in
"relocate_kernel".

Yes, I am working on this.

Yes, this is also in plan. But with lower priority and will only be
added if necessary.
