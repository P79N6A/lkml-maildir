Well, i just checked ide-dma.c, and the WDC 21600 isn't listed.  31600 is, but no
21600
I've been using the 21600 for awhile now with DMA enabled, under reasonable load,
and it seems to hold up.
Guennadi: I don't suppose you can get your hands on a different size/brand drive
long enough to plug it in, and see if it allows DMA?
