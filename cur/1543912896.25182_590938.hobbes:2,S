Oh god, not another Linux/*BSD month-long flamewar chewing up more  
developer resources than Microsoft has ever had.  Please nobody else  
reply to such flamebait and let's get on to productive code  
development.  If you think it really matters to you, then please do  
the following in order:
   1)  Come back in a week.  License issues can be easily resolved  
even months later.  Look at the SCO case, for example, they didn't  
have a legal peg-leg to stand on and they've been churning through  
the legal system for years.
   2)  Reread all of the posts in the other threads (either through  
the archives or whatever).  In particular look at Adrian Bunk's  
emails, he seems to have a pretty sane grasp on the subject.
   3)  When you want to reply USE THE SAME THREAD!!!  Most of the  
people on this list don't really give a damn about legal crap, we  
just want to write code or have interesting technical discussions.   
By using the same thread we only have one button to click to hide it  
forever.
   4)  Refrain from rhetoric and name-calling, it's unproductive and  
childish.
That said, Marc Espie seems to be all set to blast the first person  
who isn't frothing at the mouth in support of BSD, so... Plonk!
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
