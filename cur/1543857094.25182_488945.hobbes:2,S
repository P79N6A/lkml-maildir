It might also be interesting to see if this would change code-size at all. 
There's a number of things that check different bits in the same word 
right now, and they just reload the word unnecessarily and do multiple 
tests. Some of the page flags functions obviously already work around this 
by doing horrible things by hand instead, eg:
                (page->flags & (
                        1 << PG_lru     |
                        1 << PG_private |
                        1 << PG_locked  |
                        1 << PG_active  |
                        1 << PG_reclaim |
                        1 << PG_slab    |
                        1 << PG_swapcache |
                        1 << PG_writeback |
                        1 << PG_reserved |
                        1 << PG_buddy ))
in the free_pages_check() thing. It may make sense there, but we really 
_should_ allow gcc to just do things like this for us, and just use the 
proper functions to test bits.
