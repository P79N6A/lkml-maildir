If you want a feature merged upstream it is in your basic interest to 
keep it in a tidy, cleanly split up series of patches, with no 
development history in the patches - and frequently post those patches 
to lkml. (it also makes sense tocount the number of times you've posted 
them and make that visible in the postings: so the first series should 
be titled "perform2, v1", the second one "perfmon2, v2" - that way when 
people see "perform2, v25" they'll get a rough picture of the maturity 
of the patchset)
