Yep, that's what I've been hashing out with Stephen today...
In one of my cases journal_dirty_data has dropped & re-acquired the
bh_state lock and j_list_lock, and journal_unmap_buffer has come along
in the meantime.
So it looks like we are missing some state tests, i.e. buffer_mapped(),
at a couple points after we acquire jbd_lock_bh_state().
