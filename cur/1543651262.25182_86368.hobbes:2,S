Now I understand. It's a combined symlink/capabilities pair. I thought
to have this extra direntry, containing capabilities only. But I
didn't get the connection between the binary and the cap direntry. You
go just the other way round from cap/symlink to the binary.

I thought that's what the inheritable vs. permitted set is for.
