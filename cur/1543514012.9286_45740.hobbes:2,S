It cant - Not GPL ...
GPL Paragraph 2b says 
--------
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
--------
Everything must be under the terms of THIS (GPL) License which is not true
for the Intel drivers... 
They didnt even made an attempt to be compatible with the GPL.
