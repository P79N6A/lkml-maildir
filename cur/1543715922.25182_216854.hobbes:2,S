There is no need to _argue_ about the GPL if you don't want to.
Just obey the terms.  If you don't, then you're arguing.
To me, the argument above looks like "we concentrate on making
things work for our customers, not on obeying the laws."  
An argument frequently used by people you probably don't want to be 
compared with. You probably didn't intend it that way, but that
what it looks like for those serious about the GPL.

Do not be surprised that people don't want to support your driver for free.
Everything has a price. Business usually wants to be paid in money,
kernel coders tend to want payment in the form of GPL'ed code.
Not wanting to pay in code _is_ ok, but then you get to deal with any
trouble happening to any kernel running your module, because nobody
else volunteers.

Well, sometimes design decisions simply doesn't go your way.  There may
indeed be no way to make Linus change his mind, so of course he tells you
to go away.  The same would happen if you tried to have microsoft make a
design change _they_ don't want.  You are lucky in the linux case though,
kernel developers may not support your NDIS driver but you _can_ supply
your own kernel patch (or a complete kernel) with big stacks.
Right now the 4k stack is relatively new, so the patch for 8k is simple.
In the future, there will probably be bigger pages and then your
problem goes away.  In the meantime you're allowed to maintain your
own patch for whatever you can't get into mainline.

I believe you have to remove the \0 to operate legally (or release the 
full source under the GPL for real.)   
Your customer's problem is fixable though.  Either by also changing the logging level
so the message doesn't go out on the console, or by patching the line 
with that printk() out of your customer's kernel.
You can do this as a part of your install program.  If it gets too hard, consider
supplying the customer with your own precompiled kernel.
