Ok, yes, there are places like this, and clearly, they need to go away.
We are subscribed to fs-devel, and we are making a real effort to stay
more up to date on all the kernel changes (yes, we are on fs-devel).  We
should have been fixing the problems you described earlier, but it just
didn't get done.
I'm sending a patch out in a few hours that will have bug fixes, and a
port to 2.3.51.  It won't have the cleanup you describe, I'll start on
that on Monday.
Many thanks for you comments and review,
Chris
