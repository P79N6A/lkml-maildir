It gets stuffed onto the stack at process creation time, see
fs/binfmt_elf.c, however once the application has started running
there is little you can do to get it back, in particular as glibc will
modify it on certain architectures.
Passing user space command lines from within the kernel is *really*
not something one should consider doing.
