Hi,
i can experience hard lockups when turning off all the VP stuff via the
/proc interface.
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hardirq_preemption
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/softirq_preemption
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/voluntary_preemption
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kernel_preemption
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
then do some audio work with jackd and the machine locks up in the next
3 or 4 minutes. How can i help in debugging this? I know only very
little about core dumps, etc, so it would be cool if anyone of you guys
can reproduce the lockup. Or tell me how to proceed..
