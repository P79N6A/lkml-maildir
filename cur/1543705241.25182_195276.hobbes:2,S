I have seen the problem as well.
It is not just processes using the IDE.  Everything will pause for a
second or two. (Which causes grief with streaming audio running at the
same time.)
Even more annoying is that it does not always occur. I have not tried
tracking down where the kernel is getting hung up at that moment since
it has been fairly intermittent for me.
