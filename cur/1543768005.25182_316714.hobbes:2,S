Sure, I will remove the io_apic_get_unique_id() then. Perhaps, it will
be easy to put it back in if someone implements a chipset that needs it.

Andi, I submitted the patch for i386 a little while ago
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0505.0/0195.html
 (I sent
it to you also, but just noticed that it was not your usual email
address - where did I get if from? have no idea...) Genapic in i386 has
a NO_IOAPIC_CHECK flag that is defined in every subarch, so it was easy
to fix the problem by making use of it in ACPI boot path just as it was
used in MP path.
Thanks,
