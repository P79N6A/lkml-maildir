No patches - linux-2.4.17 right off of www.linux.org.  
The chipset is an ALI 1487/1489.  
The disk itself is a JUMPtec DISKchip with a SanDisk 20-99-00024-1 on it.
The relevant lines from dmesg are:
 Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
 ide: Assuming 50MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
 hda: SunDisk SDTB-128, ATA DISK drive
 ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
 hda: 31360 sectors (16 MB) w/1KiB Cache, CHS=490/2/32
 Partition check:
  hda: hda1 hda2 hda3
% cat /proc/ide/driver
ide-disk version 1.10
There is a CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI14XX, but apparently it only turns on 
support for the second channel.  I tried it anyway (along with the 
ide0=ali14xx boot parameter), but the disk was then not recognized 
at boot time (busy/timeout during partition check).  A google search 
did not turn up any problems with ali14xx.c since 2.0.
What else should I try?
Thanks.
