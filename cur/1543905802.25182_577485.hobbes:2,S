Subject: [PATCH] argv_split: allow argv_split to handle NULL pointer in argcp parameter gracefully
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As Jeremy and I had discussed in a previous thread, it would be nice if the
argv_split library function could gracefully handle a NULL pointer in the argcp
parameter, so as to allow functions using it that did not care about the value
of argc to not have to declare a useless variable.  This patch accomplishes
that.  Tested by me, with successful results.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
