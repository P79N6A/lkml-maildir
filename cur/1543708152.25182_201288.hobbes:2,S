There is no problem with such a shell if you use scripts beginning with
#!/some/shell
or
#!/some/shell -some_arg
if some_arg does not contain whitespace characters. In both cases,
argv will be the same as it is with the current code.
/some/script param1 param2
will become
/some/shell /some/script param1 param2
or
/some/shell -some_arg /some/script param1 param2
as it has been before.
There is a problem with a shebang line like
#!/some/shell -x -y
_but_ this was most probably an error, before. (Unless this shell
accepts _one_ parameter "-x -y" containing a space.)
So, I really can't see any problem with such a shell...
