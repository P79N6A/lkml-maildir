After booting with 2.6.10-mm1, I get the following message on the serial
console (last message seen):
PCI: 0000:00:0b.0 has unsupported PM cap regs version (1)
For reference, lspci shows that device is
00:0b.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI (rev 02)
I notice there is a relatively recent patch to add this message.
  
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/263974
However, my .config includes
#
# Power management options (ACPI, APM)
#
# CONFIG_PM is not set
which should disable all power management related processing.
[1] Should the code generating the warning be active without CONFIG_PM
being set?
[2] Can you explain why the message is generated (why not silently ignore
the older hardware) or is there something in an init script (I am using
Fedora Core 2) that [incorrectly] assumes power management is available to
cause the message to be printed?
