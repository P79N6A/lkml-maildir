Has it occured to you that some of this might be because the code does stuff
like hide flags in the low bits of addresses and do unchecked kmallocs ?
Things people have tried to send patches for ..
The best way to get stuff to Linus is to feed him changes one at a time and
make them all clean and clearly correct. When I have a big set of changes I
normally start by feeding Linus all the 'fluff' - spelling checks and small
warning fixes. After that its normally easy to pick out changes one at a time
and feed them on.
Given 500 lines of mixed up diff it is very hard to verify the correctness of
anything.
