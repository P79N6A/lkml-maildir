That's correct.

I am just learning this stuff as well, so hopefully someone will correct
me if I'm wrong.  This seems like a poorly worded erratum.  The acpiphp
driver does not actual do any config reads - it just asks the acpi core
to read the acpi namespace to determine the hotplug capabilities.  I
will try to find out more about the test case that they used to discover
this problem and get someone to explain it to me in english.

No, it seems that patches done at 4:45 on Friday don't turn out
optimally :).

This was me being paranoid.  I was concerned that some BIOS might decide
to enable by default, so I was just trying to make really really sure
that MSI would be turned off.  Think that's overkill?
