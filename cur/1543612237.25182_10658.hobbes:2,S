Semi-transparent: Proxy ARP, works at a site that I administer.
Really transparent: Check out bridge.sourceforge.net, that project -
among other goals - aims at making Linux 2.4's bridge code aware of
netfilter.
I'm not quite sure if some BSD variants can already do that (FreeBSD
maybe), check their sites as well.
Hope that helps.

P. S.: the "To" address of your news-to-list gateway is
"mlist-linux-kernel", which breaks list detection and automatic list
replies in some mailers, notably mutt. Please include Mail-Followup-To:
headers or have the administrator of the news-to-mail gate fix their
configuration. Thanks a lot.
