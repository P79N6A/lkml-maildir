Suppose we define a "EV_* is a notify event" bit to set in the event type
field of an input event.
Now, any type of event can be a notify event or a normal event, depending on
wether this bit is set.
However, the input layer keeps track of which events of a given type can be
sent by an input device using bitmaps, for every type of event.  And this
bitmap now would mean "input device may issue a normal event or a notify
event", not just "input device may issue a normal event".
I am not sure if that would cause trouble?
