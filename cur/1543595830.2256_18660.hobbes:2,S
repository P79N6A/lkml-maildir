	In a /proc file, maybe?  A single file ("/proc/authors"?
"/proc/versions"? "/proc/brags"? "/proc/kvell"?)  could present the
whole section.  Alternatively, you could have one /proc file per
attributed source file; I suspect that would be messier to code.  In a
modular system, would it be feasible to dynamically link/unlink
attribution strings from a global list as modules are loaded/unloaded,
and display linked attributions along with static ones in the /proc
file?
	Extrapolating from past behavior into the future:  someone will
submit code with a multi-page attribution string.  It is likely that
we'd need a formal policy on the length, content, and maybe even format
of attribution strings.
