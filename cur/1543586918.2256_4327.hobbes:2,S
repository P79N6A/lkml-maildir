Hello,
I would like to thank everybody who replied to my question yesterday.
There were a lot of good suggestions and examples for me to go and look
at.
The conclusion we had come to between ourselves here was already very
similar to most things suggested, but we were running into some smaller
problems that would make our release too difficult to use for most
customers.
And ofcourse, I have no realised that it is not enough to simply release
your code under GPL. You need to tie in with the real kernel as soon as
you can.
Thanks again all for your help.
