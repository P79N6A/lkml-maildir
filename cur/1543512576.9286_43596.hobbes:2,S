I appreciate the commentary you have brought to this debate,
as it was, until now, re-hashing tired old points.

I only happens when you plug/un-plug PCI devices, including
host adapters. What if you turn on your PC with the one or
two external SCSI hard drives removed, and you were using
the disk or partitions raw, as with LVM? Methinks you're
screwed.

Not with the above, most relevant example.

That's why devfs is SO COOL!!! You still have /dev/sda, and automatically
I might add, but you also have location based naming to use if needed.
It only adds flexibility, nothing else. What if Solaris had an option
where you could turn the location naming off altogether?? I'd say
some admins would be astounded by the flexibility of the cool OS!
And BTW, I thought the whole naming scheme was a SYSV thing, not a
Solaris one...
