Which seems to confirm that glibc and native pthread can't care.

Could you elaborate a bit on how the semantics of returning the
wrong information are more useful?
In particular if a thread does the logical equivalent of:
grep Pid: /proc/self/status.  It always get the tgid despite
having a different process id.
How can that possibly be useful or correct?
From the kernel side I really think the current semantics of /proc/self
in the context of threads is a bug and confusing.  All of the kernel
developers first reaction when this was pointed out was that this
is a regression.
If it is truly useful to user space we can preserve this API design
bug forever.  I just want to make certain we are not being bug
compatible without a good reason.
Currently we have several kernel side bugs with threaded
programs because /proc/self does not do the intuitive thing.  Unless
something has changed recently selinux will cause accesses by a
non-leader thread to fail when accessing files through /proc/self.
So far the more I look at the current /proc/self behavior the
more I am convinced it is broken, and useless.  Please help me see
where it is useful, so we can justify keeping it.
Thanks,
Eric
