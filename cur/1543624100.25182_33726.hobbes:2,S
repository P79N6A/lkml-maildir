At some point I had done a port of SGI's pset/sysmp interface to linux 2.2.
As far as I know, lots of people are still using it.  I haven't ported it
to 2.4 for various reasons, but I have to say - IT IS A MUCH BETTER
INTERFACE than all these ad-hoc cpus_allowed bits.
If I thought that it had a chance of inclusion, maybe I'd port it up, but
last I heard none of the "core" people wanted it.
If we are going to pick an affinity system, please, let's consider sysmp().
