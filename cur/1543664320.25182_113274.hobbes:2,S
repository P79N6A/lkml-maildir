I mentioned this previously; it's still happening.
This started some time around 2.5.62-mm3 with the io_load results on contest 
benchmarking (
http://contest.kolivas.org
) rising with each run. It still 
occurs with 2.5.63-mm1 regardless of which elevator is specified. This is the 
io load result time(seconds) for 6 consecutive runs in compile time:
111
147
221
284
334
358
/proc/meminfo after 6 runs and mem flushing:

I am refraining from publishing any benchmark results with this happening. It 
doesn't seem to occur on 2.5.63
