I am just curious, but what specific hardware devices can be controlled with this?

Please put the power comment in the source too, e.g. :
+enum led_functions {
+	leds_user = 0,	/* user has control of this led through sysfs */
+	leds_timer,	/* led blinks on a timer */
+	leds_idle,	/* led is on when the system is not idle */
+	leds_power,	/* led is on when ?????????????????????? */
+};
To be honest, I don't get the meaning of any of the led_functions except leds_user...

Is something like max_colors or num_colors necessary?
Might be handy for changing to the "last" color or something,
but it may as well be done by userspace app.
