Those processes are likely waiting for I/O to complete (well start,
even) on a disk that is on the same channel as the cd drive doing the
blank command. If the program you are using to do the blank is not using
the IMMED bit, you will be stuck waiting for the command to complete
(ATA has no real disconnect).
