Problem is portability between different architectures, especially little
endian versus big endian.  The 3c59x driver used to use a bitfield to
represent hardware registers and had some lovely ifdeffery to make it work
on ppc hardware.
It's safe enough in arch-specific code but one may as well use the same
idioms as are used in generic code.
