The code is OK, I think.  It says, in a rather tortured manner,
"if debug > 0 then print stuff, unless it is a max-collisions-exceeded
event" and "if debug > 2 then print all events".
Probably many of these driver messages should be throttled
by net_ratelimit() but in practice, things work out OK.
Your machine is a special case, because your network is
bust.  The default value of `debug' is 1.  If you set
it to zero, those messages should go away?
