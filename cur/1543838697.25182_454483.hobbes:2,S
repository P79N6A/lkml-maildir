I'll experiment with this.  When doing, say, an ftp, there are 
enough TCP ack packets coming back to have NAPI netdev->poll 
be called frequently enough?

Hmm. Or maybe I'm just getting old. Once upon a time, low watermarks
were considered the "best" way of doing anything; never occurred to me
it would be considered "strange".  Based on my probably obsolete idea
of what constitutes "slick hardware", I was actually impressed by what
the spidernet could do.
Aside from cleaning up the transmit ring in the receive poll loop,
what would be the not-so-strange way of doing things?
