This is showing up on TKO as well and Andy Whitcroft has kicked it
around a bit as far as I know. He makes it build with this patch
http://test.kernel.org/abat/88951/build/patches/update-sysfs-kset-initialisation-in-PPC64-DLPAR-IO-driver
However, my understand is that the driver is broken even though it builds
but I don't recall why. I've added Andy to the CC
