POSIX 1003.1 wouldn't like this at all:
3.3.1.2, pg 73:
  "Conversely, when SIGCONT is generated for a process, all pending stop
   signals for that process shall be discarded."
3.3.1.2, pg 76:
  "While a process is stopped, any additional signals that are sent to
   the process shall not be delivered until the process is continued
   [...]"
So no, SIGSTOP/SIGCONT can't nest.
