Hello,
Now that the site has a few months of life, it's time to advertize its
existence to the kernel community! The site is collecting hardware
compatibilities and incompatibilities with Linux distributions in a
collaborative way: users run a hardware collector program, upload the
resulting file and then rate and comment how their hardware works. You
could be interested in the pages around kernel modules:
http://hardware4linux.info/modules/.
 You can also access to the
information concerning PCI and USB devices using the following urls:
http://hardware4linux.info/pci/<vendor_id>/<device_id>/<sub_vendor>/<sub_device>/
http://hardware4linux.info/usb/<vendor_id>/<device_id>/.
Any feedback welcome!
