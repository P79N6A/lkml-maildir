Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/3] cell/spufs: new experimental features
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/17/286

These three patches implement features that are
desired by many of the cell/spufs users in order
to improve performance and functionality of cell
specific applications.
Since they all touch very sensitive parts of the
kernel (memory management and system calls), I
would at least like a thorough review before
declaring the interfaces stable and submitting the
patches for inclusion.
