Yes.  At one point, somebody suggested XML.  Now, as much as I hate the fact
that people somehow equate high-tech with tags, I think whomever originally
suggested it might be on to something.  :)
Fact is, just about EVERY language out there has some sort of utility to
parse XML.  There's expat for C, Perl and Python have libs, etc.  We could
even write a proc DTD that could specify the valid data types.
There are two problems:
1. Performance - it's slower to go through a library that outputs XML than
do a printf("%d", pid) or the like.
2. Space - based on a little experience using XML as a transport, the space
used by the tags adds up.
3. Work - writing a good package to do this, and rewriting bits of the
kernel to use it.  I'll volunteer my time.
Just a thought,
Craig
