No, you've been brainwashed by CS people who thought that Niklaus Wirth
actually knew what he was talking about. He didn't. He doesn't have a
frigging clue.

Any if-statement is a goto. As are all structured loops.
Ans sometimes structure is good. When it's good, you should use it.
And sometimes structure is _bad_, and gets into the way, and using a 
"goto" is just much clearer.
For example, it is quite common to have conditionals THAT DO NOT NEST.
In which case you have two possibilities
 - use goto, and be happy, since it doesn't enforce nesting
	This makes the code _more_ readable, since the code just does what 
	the algorithm says it should do.
 - duplicate the code, and rewrite it in a nesting form so that you can 
   use the structured jumps.
	This often makes the code much LESS readable, harder to maintain, 
	and bigger.
The Pascal language is a prime example of the latter problem. Because it 
doesn't have a "break" statement, loops in (traditional) Pascal end up 
often looking like total shit, because you have to add totally arbitrary 
logic to say "I'm done now".
