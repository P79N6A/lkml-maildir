Reiser4, FUSE, maybe XFS, and GFS2.  Andreas, your support had
conditions, so I will not characterize for you whether you said Lustre
or you would like it.  Andreas, could you look at the patch and see what
you think?
I think with some confidence that this interface will acquire more users
than those over time.  It really is the right natural interface for most
filesystems that try to carefully optimize write performance.
