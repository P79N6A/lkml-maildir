Yeah, but we constantly have all-filesystem sweeps, and being able to 
retain those in memory would be a key to performance, *especially* from 
the upload latency standpoint.

Just tweaked it (setting it to 1).  There really should be another 
sysctl to set the denominator instead of hardcoding it at 100, since the 
granularity of this sysctl at the very low end is really much too coarse.
I missed this sysctl since the name isn't really all that obvious.
