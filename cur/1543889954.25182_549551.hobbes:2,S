Yes, I will look into it. I think it was related to my
onboard RTL networking chip. When trying to bring it down,
it oopses the machine. But I'm not sure what happens exactly, yet.
I'll take a look at it.

I think we don't have IRQ assignment problems. Uwe simply disabled
b44-PCI support in his first bugreport (I guess). So there was
no b44-PCI driver loaded.
Later on he said that it does magically work now...
