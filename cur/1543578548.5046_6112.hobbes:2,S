I acquired a VIA Mobo (ASUS CUV4X) for home and it is workin pretty damn
spiffy with Linux - Even better with 2.4.0 with regards to IDE!!!
Once a month I boot WinDOS to play a game I can't play in Linux, THEN
my troubles begin!!!
parport_pc: Via 686A parallel port: io=0x378, irq=7, dma=3
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686a IDE UDMA66 controller on pci0:4.1
etc... etc... etc...
yadda yadda yadda ....
Alan,
My father repaired F-4 Phantoms in Vietnam.  He said the F-4 Phantom was
proof that if you put enough power behind a brick, it would fly!!!
Your comment remonded me of that - just had to share  :-)
