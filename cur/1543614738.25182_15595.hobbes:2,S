If you feel adventurous you can try my rmap based
VM, the latest version is on:
	
http://surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.17-rmap-8
This VM should behave a bit better (it does on my machines),
but isn't yet bug-free enough to be used on production machines.
Also, the changes it introduces are, IMHO, too big for a stable
kernel series ;)

Rik
