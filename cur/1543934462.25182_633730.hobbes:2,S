Hmmm, basically, I think the answer is yes.
But when you tell customers your devices support USB 2.0, they will
try to plug-in lots of USB devices that you can not even imagine.
If they plug-in a combo USB device including an external USB hub, the
whole embedded Linux system maybe crash or hang there.
So this patch is to refuse enumerate such unsupported USB devices.
