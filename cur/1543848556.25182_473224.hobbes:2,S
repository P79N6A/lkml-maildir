This doesn't seem to quite work for me on a SATA-1 disc:
sas: DOING DISCOVERY on port 1, pid:1897
sas: sas_ata_phy_reset: Found ATA device.
ata1.00: ATA-7, max UDMA/133, 781422768 sectors: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)

It looks like the first few commands get through (read capacity, ATA
IDENTIFY etc) and it hangs up on the read for the partition table.
