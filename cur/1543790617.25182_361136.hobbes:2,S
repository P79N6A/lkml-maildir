Yah, that's a known one, the problem is due to the removal of
device_initialize() from pci_device_add(). The breaks the new mecanism
on ppc64 that creates the PCI tree from the firmware instead of probing
the bus. In addition, even with that fixed, the code looking for PME#
will not be run on the pmac neither.
I'm not 100% what is the best fix at this point. I suppose it would be 2
things, let me know what you think about it:
 - Have the ppc64 PCI tree code call device_initialize() itself before
calling pci_device_add()
 - Move the search of PME# (and possibly other similar bits) from probe
to pci_device_add()
