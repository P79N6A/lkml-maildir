Close ;-) It is both a command-line option _and_ a field in the image
header. The former (if present) overrides the latter.
The whole story: if you're using LILO (1), there are the following
places where the value may be set:
 - default value, by kernel build
 - optional: any changes made with rdev
 - if lilo.conf has a root=... line: default beginning of kernel
   command line (see /proc/cmdline - there's usually a root=xxxx
   option there)
 - optional: whatever you put into APPEND=... (not very useful, but
   yes, you can override also root= this way)
 - optional: any manually added root=... options
 - if using initrd: RAM disk takes precedence over other root
   settings (2)
(1) since LILO version 13 ('94). Older versions overwrote the header
    field in memory at load time.
(2) this hack will probably disappear in the future. You can do the
    same thing with pivot_root in an infinitely cleaner way.
