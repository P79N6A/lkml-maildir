It doesn't help of course, the fb drivers also pci_enable the devices, 
really X needs a kicking square, I'm trying to figure out some sort of fix 
here, but X does't some really stupid things with PCI resources...
We really need a userspace way to pci_enable_device that X can call (via 
sysfs) so for cards that don't have a DRM or fb loaded we still get 
something..
