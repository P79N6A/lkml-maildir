Yeah, I'm not at all trying to say that Tivo has the "right to make 
money". 
They can fail for all I care. 
But they do have the right to make their own choices, and try their own 
strategies. And people shouldn't complain about that. If somebody doesn't 
like the Tivo box, and the Tivo service requirements, just don't *buy* the 
damn thing, and don't sign up for the service.
Whining about Tivo's choices is just stupid.
And anybody who thinks others don't have the "right to choice", and then 
tries to talk about "freedoms" is a damn hypocritical moron.
