    I'm using slackware 8.1(2.4.18) with a Athlon thunderbird 850 mhz, a
Asus A7V133 (Via KT133A) and a ps/2 Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical and when
I use the mouse, the mouse and the keyboard freezes.
    I've got the problem first in the X11/KDE, but I've tried  to exec a
"cat /dev/mouse" and "cat /dev/psaux" on the console and it freezes too.
I've tried a genius netmouse and happened the same thing. The computer seems
to be working but the keboard and mouse do not respond, is not a system
freeze but only the keyb and mouse.
    Before the install of Slackware 8.1 I was using the 8.0 (kernel 2.2.19
and 2.4.5) and every thing is fine!
Do you have any help to me ?
ps.: the keyboard is a Genius  KB-18M standard  mini-din (not usb).
Thanks in advice,
              Edmilson Junior
