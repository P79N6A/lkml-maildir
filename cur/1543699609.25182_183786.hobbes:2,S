Subject: [PATCH] Fix a problem with 8250 UARTs on PPC

Hello.  As part of the patch I sent that went into 2.6.0-test7 (Nat Semi
SuperI/O chips on PPCs at least have a number of different divisors),
the following should have been done as well, but wasn't.  If we don't
change the divisor, we don't want to change what we claim as the uart
clock either.  Without this I don't get a usable serial console on my
Motorola Sandpoint.
