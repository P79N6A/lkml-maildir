That's the long term plan and we discussed using common code in the
discussion thread for fake NUMA (for PowerPC). We'll get there in
steps. My patch is the basic initial, simple method for implementing
fake NUMA nodes.

My patch prevents nodes from being enabled if we cross the memory
limit. Earlier they were being enabled.
