I have now had one burst of xruns. As best I can tell I was
downloading some video files for mplayer to look at, or possibly
running one of them. I see this in qjackctl:
configuring for 44100Hz, period = 128 frames, buffer = 2 periods
nperiods = 2 for capture
nperiods = 2 for playback

There have been no more xruns since that burst about an hour ago.
Looking in the logs there is a suspicious 1394 access problem:

/dev/sdb1 in this case holds a 50GB ogg-based music library. It's been
streaming since I brought the kernel up.
1394 problems????
Thanks,
