One of my suspend2 users had the same thing yesterday. Unfortunately
there's no easy way for us to detect that another kernel has been
booted. The simplest solution we've found is to add commands in your
init scripts to mkswap the place where your image is stored when
rebooting. This will stop both of the implementations seeing the image
and resuming at a later time.
