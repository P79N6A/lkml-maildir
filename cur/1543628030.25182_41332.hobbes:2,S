This is exactly the problem; I don't think it's going to be unusual to
see volumes that have a variety of mappings.  For example the
'journal' area of the lv with a single fast pv, 'small file' area with
a linear mapping across normal pv's, and finally a 'large file' area
that has a few slower disks striped together.
The last thing I want in this situation is to split up all the io into
the lowest common chunk size, in this case the striped area which will
typically be  < 64k.
LVM and EVMS need to do the splitting and resubmitting of bios
themselves.
