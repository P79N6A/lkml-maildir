The way that I'm considering implementing this is by intentionally  
fragmenting the allocation bitmap, catalog file, etc, such that each  
1/8 or so of the disk contains its own allocation bitmap describing  
its contents, its own set of files or directories, etc.  The  
allocator would largely try to keep individual btree fragments  
cohesive, such that one of the 1/8th divisions of the disk would only  
have pertinent data for itself.  The idea would be that when trying  
to look up an allocation block, in the common case you need only  
parse a much smaller subsection of the disk structures.

Not entirely true.  I _believe_ you could use such data structures to  
make the allocation algorithm much more robust against fragmentation  
if you record the right kind of information.
