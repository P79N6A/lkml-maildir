I've noticed on two seperate testboxes (x86 and x86-64) that 8139too
won't recieve packets unless I boot with 'noapic acpi=off' now.
And yes, it has to be both those options, one on its own of either
doesn't make the problem go away. 100% reproducable.
Doesn't seem to affect any other drivers I've tried though.
