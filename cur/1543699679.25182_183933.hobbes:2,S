The kernel made some attempts. It often worked and often failed.

So you script sfdisk or so in order to setup large numbers of disks
and cannot use constant geometry settings because this is on many
different BIOSes that disagree on the desired geometry?
And this is all on disks smaller than 8 GB so that at least there can be
some geometry?
