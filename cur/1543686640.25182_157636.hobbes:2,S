I think you might be able to get what you want with madvise() or perhaps
by mmap()ing new clean pages on top of the pages you want to throw away.

I would not implement this unless you either know you have a problem
with your mempool swap speed or you are bored.  I doubt it is going
to help a lot, and it will certainly simplify your code to leave it
out.  If you later find that you have performance problems you can
look into this again.
