I can good understand that it is a hardware problem.
But if someone seems not to be interested in reports like this,
why dump them out? Just save what we can and hang silently,
but no reports, they're boring 8-]
What does the "Bank 4: b200000000040151" mean?
If that is a memory, can anyone help to find out which slot it is?
(memtest86 haven't found anything, btw, i doubt that counts)

P.S. if someone going to change the message about machine check,
could you please avoid lame descriptions? Like "(hardware problem!)"?
I sure the majority are experienced enough to understand what the
words "Machine Check" mean.
