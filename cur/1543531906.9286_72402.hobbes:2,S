Ah. 2.3.99pre3 needs this.

What do you mean by "privileged"?   The global cli would protect the
ioctl - otherwise it would need to share a lock with the timer and tx
timeout?

In the 2.3 driver tx_timeout() does serious stuff with both the tx and
rx hardware.  I'm wondering if there's some way in which
speedo_interrupt() can be invoked during this.  An rx interrupt would do
it.  A spinlock_irqsave() in tx_timeout() would prevent this.
