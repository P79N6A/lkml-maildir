Well which one?  Here is an ioctl(). It certainly modifies one
of its parameter values.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <termios.h>
void barf(void);
void barf()
{
    puts("Broken\n");
    exit(0);
}
int main()
{
    struct termios t;
    __asm__ __volatile__("movl	$0xdeadface, %ebx\n");
    (void)ioctl(0, TCGETS, &t); 
    (void)getpid();
    __asm__ __volatile__("cmpl	$0xdeadface, %ebx\n"
                         "jnz   barf\n");
    return 0;
}
Until you can show the syscall that doesn't follow the correct
rules, then my example is not flawed. In fact a modified example can
be used to find any broken calls.
