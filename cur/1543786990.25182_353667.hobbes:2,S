How can you load a module multiple times on _any_ distro?
More specifically, how exactly do you get past this check in module.c:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/kernel/module.c#L1534
         if (find_module(mod->name)) {
                 err = -EEXIST;
                 goto free_mod;
         }
That means there can only be one bonding instance => there's only one
"primary" parameter for all bonding devices => the semantics are broken.
eth0 \          eth2 \
      bond0           bond1
eth1 /          eth3 /
current semantics: modprobe bonding max_bonds=2 primary=eth0 ...
      => bond0(primary==eth0), bond1(primary==eth0)(!!!)
new/patch semantics: modprobe bonding max_bonds=2 primary=eth0,eth2 ...
      => bond0(primary==eth0), bond1(primary==eth2)
Currently it's impossible to implement multiple
prioritized active/backup bonds - or am I missing something?

The patch is not forcing the scripts to switch since the old syntax/ABI
still works (one reason I didn't touch arp_ip_target was to preserve
that). It's simply providing an additional (saner) approach to bonding
configuration which can easily co-exist with the sysfs solution.

I'm not sure I see the real value in bonding _without_ the capabilities
provided by this patch 8)
Not being able to set a (different) preferred
interface/primary for each bond device makes it unacceptable for
deployment in our environment.
