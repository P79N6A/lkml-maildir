It shouldn't be, especially for filesystems which have one-second timestamp
granularity.
Filesystems which have s_time_gran=1 might hurt a bit, but no more than
they will with write().
Actually, no - we'd only update the mctime once per page per writeback
period (30 seconds by default) so the load will be small.  It'll be more
often if the user is doing a lot of pte-cleaning via msync() or fsync(),
but then the m/ctime writes will be the least of their problems. 
I'd have thought there were more substantial problems with something that
crude?
