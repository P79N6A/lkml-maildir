Well, everybody judges the usefulness of top differently. But I think a
time of 350ms (which is about 12 million processor cycles and much more
instructions) is waaay too long to display a few task statistics.

Are you sure that you are measuring this correctly? This is a serious
question: cpu time measurements are very incorrect (at least under
linux). My very crude measurement gives a lower bound (module system
load).

Then have a look at what people run on their desktops. Have a look at how
many people can be logged on to a machine, all with their desktop. These
very small times quickly sum up to a substantial amount of time.
As it is, /proc gives hundreds of pieces of information scattered about
many places, in a very inconsistent way (for example, how can I find the
statistics of my fifth harddisk? I can't find a place in proc...).
/proc is a nice place for things like cpuinfo, modules, partitions, uptime
and much more. But I fail to see the advantage of information that can
only be parsed by specialised programs ("number graves") anyway to be
published in /proc, so that it is ultra-slow to access.
