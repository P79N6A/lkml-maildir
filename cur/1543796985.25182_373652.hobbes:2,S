Linux has exempted itself from IP regulations of various countries by
a form of jurisdictional arbitrage, especially in the realms of reverse
engineering and cryptography. These sorts of IP regulations have strong
support from entrenched hardware, software, and entertainment interests,
and as the establishment of international/supranational regulatory
agencies proceeds and as regulatory "harmonizations" advance, this
jurisdictional arbitrage will become progressively more difficult to
continue. In particular, the "intellectual property" lobbyists, unless
challenged on a scale heretofore unseen, are likely to attempt to
convince individual governments to implement similar regulations one by
one as well as use such international/supranational affairs as the WTO,
EUCD, et al to impose such on countries otherwise disinclined to do so.
In particular, there is word of an initiative in France that threatens
to ban Linux and possibly all open-source software outright as
containing insufficient protections against the illegal dissemination
of copyrighted works, and/or as presenting some sort of threat to
royalty-based software, and/or (if I understand the notion properly) an
"illegal subsidy" to competitors of for-profit software firms, as
public utilities and other nonprofit and/or governmentally-erected
infrastructure have been ruled to be in various other instances. In
essence, a counterpart of the DMCA which declares open source software
and/or Linux a technology that can circumvent copyright protection, if
the DMCA doesn't do so itself.
Also, IP issues related to hardware are unlikely to stand still. As
observed earlier, several hardware vendors are looking to close their
driver source or to only offer binary drivers in the future. The
jurisdictional arbitrage under which the reverse engineering so common
for the implementation of open source drivers takes place is also
rather likely to be thwarted by similar attempts to promote legislation
to the above entertainment-related efforts.
So, as seen above, the "IP issues," if they're getting resolved at all,
don't appear to be getting resolved in Linux' favor. To all
appearances, there is literally an effort to legislate Linux out of
existence. One might call this "lawfare" (warfare through legislation)
against Linux.
