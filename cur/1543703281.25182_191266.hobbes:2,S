Where it is always out of date, according to my experience. People tend
to update their kernel more often than lspci, so on most machines I've
been on, I usally point lspci to the kernel copy of it.
sth. needs to be done in this area in the main distros (e.g. more
frequent updates of just this file as a package would be fine).
