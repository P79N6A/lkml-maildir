I don't care one _whit_ about the size of the binary. I don't maintain 
binaries, adn the binary can be gigabytes for all I care.
The only thing I care about is source code. So the "build it as a module 
and it is not bloat" argument is a total nonsense thing as far as I'm 
concerned. 
Anyway, new code is always bloat to me, unless I see people using them.
Guys, why do you even bother trying to convince me? If you are right, you 
will be able to convince other people, and that's the whole point of open 
source.
Being "vendor-driven" is _not_ a bad thing. It only means that _I_ am not
personally convinced. I'm only one person.
