    Disk or Disc?
    The divergence in spelling is due in part to the way in which
    the words originated. Disk came into the English language in
    the mid-17th century, and was modelled on words such as whisk;
    disc arose some time later, and was based on the original Latin
    root discus. In the 19th century, disc became the conventional
    spelling for audio recordings made on a flat plate, such as
    the gramophone record; this usage gave rise to the modern term
    disc jockey. Early BBC technicians differentiated between disks
    (in-house transcription records) and discs (the colloquial term
    for commercial gramophone records, or what the BBC dubbed CGRs).
    By the 20th century, the c-spelling was more popular in
    British English, while the k-spelling was preferred in American
    English. In the 1940s, when the American company IBM pioneered
    the first hard disk storage devices, the k-spelling was used. In
    1979 the European company Philips, along with Sony, developed the
    compact disc medium; here, the c-spelling was chosen, possibly
    because of the predominating British spelling, or because the
    compact disc was seen as a successor to the analogue disc record.
    Whatever their heritage, in computer jargon today it is common
    for the k-spelling to refer mainly to magnetic storage devices,
    while the c-spelling is customary for optical media such as the
    compact disc and similar technologies. Even in the computing
    field, however, the terms are used inconsistently; software
    documentation often uses the k-spelling exclusively.
