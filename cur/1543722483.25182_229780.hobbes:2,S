Yes, ide never got completly moved over to sysfs like scsi did.  We
never had the time to do this work, sorry.
But now your parsing should be easier with the one-value to one-file
rule, right?  And libsysfs should help out here with all of the symlinks
and readdir, etc calls.

But all of those devices are block devices.  You want a hardware
picture, right?  sysfs never said it would show you just that, but it
makes it easier to determine.
For this specific instance, just look for block devices that have a
device symlink that points to a real device.

Hm, I think libsysfs can give you this, if you ask for the block devices
that are associated with each individual device associated with a
driver.
The whole "what driver controls what devices" is not a simple one to one
mapping all the time, with drivers that work on multiple types of
busses, and drivers that control devices that contain multiple class
devices, etc.  It's not a simple thing to solve, sorry.
But what you can use is the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() information in the
modules to try to help you out here.  That details a mapping of what
kind of devices that specific driver supports.

I agree, I don't think that many things have disappeared from /proc just
yet, right?  You should just have more information than what you
previously did, right?  Or did scsi drop their /proc support fully?
