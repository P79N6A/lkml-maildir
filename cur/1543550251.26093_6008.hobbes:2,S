That, again, is the IDE driver issue, not the FS layer's. If you want to
access the extra data beyond the reported capacity (which was hidden by
BIOS say for hibernation), you need the IDE driver to report the extra
capacity to the rest of the kernel.
It's not important what the drive says, it's important what your IDE
driver says to the rest of the kernel.

No. It'll solicit 'read request beyond end of device' messages in dmesg.
And the request will of course fail. Beyond the capacity reported to the
kernel by the IDE driver. But that's all in your power.

To what you told it when you initialized the device.

What has this to do with the rest?

Yes. Why not? The partition tables don't need to change after adding
some extra blocks to the drive at the end.

Really, there is no problem with Linux accessing some extra areas hidden
by the BIOS (via the new IDE commands) or the firmware on Linux side.
The only trouble I believe you can get into:;
* The area can be used by BIOS to save a hardcopy of the system memory to it
  during hibernation. You lose all data in the area each time your
  hibernate your notebook.
* The area may be password protected (within the drive), and you may need to
  guess the password to get there.
Anyway, I believe that it'd be good to report the REAL geometry to the
user, but also the faked one so that he sees what's happening. Possibly
allowing him to enable the full capacity say by using the kernel command
line.
