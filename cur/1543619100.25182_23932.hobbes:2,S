Ah.  So being listed in the maintainers list doesn't mean someone is actually 
a maintainer it makes sense to forward patches to?
Are you backing away from the maintainer system, or were the rest of us 
misinterpreting what it meant all along?  Does being a maintainer mean you 
feel you have delegated any actual authority to them at all, or is it merely 
a third party tech support contact point?
You seem to be saying "send patches to maintainers, support the maintainers 
better, but don't expect me to necessarily take patches from them".  Who 
should patches be sent TO?

So listed "maintainers" may need to forward patches to these people, and get 
them to sign off on them, in order to get their patches at least reviewed for 
inclusion into your tree?
If that's the process, fine.  I'm just trying to clarify what the process IS, 
other than spamming your mailbox with a cron job (as has been suggested and 
actually taken seriously as long as re-testing is also automated)...

I've noticed that rather a lot of development seems to be moving to IRC.  How 
is this NOT to be interpreted as a lack of endorsement of the functionality 
of the other channels?  Is IRC "just nice", or does IRC address a problem not 
otherwise being addressed?
