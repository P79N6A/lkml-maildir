    On x86 Linux 2.2.12, I can't figure out a reliable way to keep a
process stopped after ptrace operations.
For example, after this sequence
     ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);
     waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
     ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, SIGSTOP);
the process (pid) is not stopped.  So this does not help me.
After this sequence
     ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);     (Sequence 1)
     waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
     kill(pid, SIGSTOP);
     ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, 0);
the process is stopped.  However, following it with this sequence
     ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);
     waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
     ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, 0);
causes it to run again.  On the other hand, following Sequence 1 with
this sequence (prefacing the above sequence with a sleep)
     sleep(1);
     ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);
     waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
     ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, 0);
causes the process to remain stopped.
    I've been trying to understand this behavior from kernel sources,
but I can't figure it out -- can anyone help me?
    The program copied below demonstrates the behavior I describe.  My
questions in terms of this program are
- why does the child stop for arg==2, but not arg==1?
- why does the child stop for arg==4, but not arg==3?
    My real problem is I need a way to keep a process stopped across
multiple ptrace attach/detach operations.  Does anyone have a reliable
technique?
Thanks,
Vic Zandy
