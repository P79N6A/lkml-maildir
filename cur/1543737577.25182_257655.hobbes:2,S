Me again, we bad humor :(
My SMP/HT box is (again) terribly in that uglyness of being quite
unfriendly to -mm1, -mm2, and indirectly to -S8 and -S9 labeled kernels.
It works quite well with vanilla 2.6.9-rc3, though.
But very, very bad with those -mm1 or -mm2 patches. To get it straight,
almost all the time it hangs, randomly, but not as completely as to a
dramatic cold-reboot. It stalls on the the most administrative tasks. Name
one, and it stalls! I can hardly feel lucky if it sometimes reaches the
login prompt, while boot/initing.
I know you remember this story. Yeah. This seems quite similar to some of
earlier problems, but (un/fortunately) it doesn't seem related to VP at
all. Just having -mm1 or -mm2 is enough to make this machine go astray.
However, as usual, this seems to be ix86 SMP/HT specific. On my laptop, I
get to run full 2.6.9-rc3-mm2-S9 UP very happily.
Sorry if I can't get any real or useful debug data for now. The bad
behavior I'm referring to, is terribly non-deterministic, so I couldn't
get a pattern yet.
I just wanted to let you know ;)
Sorry for the bandwidth waste,
Cheers,
