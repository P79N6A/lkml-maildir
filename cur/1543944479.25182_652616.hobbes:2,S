Good point.
Now how do I remove a bogus commit for a tree that I've already pushed
out and published for other people, without any record of it appearing
in the GIT tree any more?
How do I insert build fixes into existing changesets so that the tree
is more bisectable?
If Jeff merged in a tree that introduced a ton of whitespace errors
git is complaing about, is there a way I can fixup that changeset
in-place? (or should I tell Jeff to start adhering to GIT's whitespace
warning messages when he applies patches?)
Those are basically the major operations that would allow me to
seriously consider rebasing a ton less often.
