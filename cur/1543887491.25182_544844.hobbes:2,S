Subject: [PATCH] i386: don't check_pgt_cache in flush_tlb_mm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/15/224

No other architecture calls check_pgt_cache() from within flush_tlb_mm(),
and i386 is already calling check_pgt_cache() from the usual places,
tlb_finish_mmu() and cpu_idle() (the latter being odd, but not unusual).
flush_tlb_mm() has no business to be freeing pages: remove that line,
which sneaked in with slub's i386 support.
