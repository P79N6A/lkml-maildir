In general not the case. I generally don't diddle my priorities, there's 
rarely a need.

Incomplete. The CFS scheduler seems to do better with latency, so you 
may get less CPU to a process but it doesn't wind up waiting a long time 
to get a fair share. So it "feels better" without micro tuning.
Face it, if you have more jobs than CPU no scheduler is going to make 
you really happy.
