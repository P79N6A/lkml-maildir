 Increased functionality I don't have a problem with, as long
 as other more important things are addressed.  And for that matter,
 Linus has said to Eric "I don't care, take this out of the
 kernel completely leaving just oldconfig'. 
 It might just be the sanest choice, and leave all this discussion
 in userland.
