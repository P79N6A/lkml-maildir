Most hardware at the very least. Every component of the PC I bought three
years ago is obsolete and most of the technology *behind* each peripheral
has been improved upon and discarded also.
Of course, that doesn't mean that it isn't still useful, but simply that
most of the intellectual property value has diminished to the point where
the manufacturers don't sell it (directly) any longer.
