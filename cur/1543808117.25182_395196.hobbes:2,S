The hell it does.  Try scsiinfo -s and you'll see.  All INQUIRY generated
by scsi midlayer have both flags set to 0.  Userland ones do not; example
I've mentioned (scsiinfo -s) will send an INQUIRY with EVPD=1 and page
code 0x80 (that's cmnd[2]), which results in response of form
	(periph_qualifier << 5) | device_type
	0x80
	<reserved>
	page length
	unit serial number (page length - 3 bytes)
Similar for page 0x83 (device identification descriptors), etc.  Userland
gets to those via SG_IO and yes, it's really used.
