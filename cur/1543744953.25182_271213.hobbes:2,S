I don't think we are looking at a flushing buffers to disk problem.
Even after doing a sync, I see 1.3M entries.  Before the sync, I
was at 1.2M, so the count went up during the sync.
I am specifically noticing problems with the inode_list and not
buffers.

This is already being done.  Nearly all of the inodes have
buffers that are expired and have been pushed to disk.

Kernel null pointer dereference in remove_inode_buffers().
