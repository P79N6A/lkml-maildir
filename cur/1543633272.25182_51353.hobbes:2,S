I would pass this by the Samba folks first.  I seem to recall them
complaining about this area.  The "one thread closing a file removes
locks from another thread" is one area that I'm sure they don't like.
Making it so that multiple threads ignore file locks is probably
not going to make them happy either.  I believe one of the issues is
that Samba is running server threads for many remote processes, and
it needs to be able to enforce these locks.
Otherwise, this change makes it impossible to write a multi-threaded
program that _does_ allow you use locking between threads.  If anything,
this PID check could be conditional on some extra lock flag (e.g.
THREADS_SHARE_LOCKS or whatever).
Cheers, Andreas
