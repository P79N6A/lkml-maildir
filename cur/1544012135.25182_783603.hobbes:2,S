Subject: [PATCH 05/10] dlm: remove extra blocking callback check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/23/96

Just before delivering a blocking callback (bast), the dlm_astd
thread checks again that the granted mode of the lkb actually
blocks the mode requested by the bast.  The idea behind this was
originally that the granted mode may have changed since the bast
was queued, making the callback now unnecessary.  Reasons for
removing this extra check are:
- dlm_astd doesn't lock the rsb before reading the lkb grmode, so
  it's not technically safe (this removes the long standing FIXME)
- after running some tests, it doesn't appear the check ever actually
  eliminates a bast
- delivering an unnecessary blocking callback isn't a bad thing and
  can happen anyway
