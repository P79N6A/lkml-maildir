the thing that took most time to develop were the Kconfig space changes, 
i've released them 2 months ago:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/auto-qa-patches/
the scripts that install a bzImage on the target system are boring and 
tied to my environment/hostnames.
with the auto-qa Kconfig patch applied, every "make randconfig" bzImage 
(on x86) is supposed to boot up fine - if it doesnt it's a 
bug/regression. Add entries to arch/x86/Kconfig.needed to force-enable 
drivers that are needed on your boxes.
