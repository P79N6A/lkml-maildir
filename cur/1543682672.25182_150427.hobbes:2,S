Hi
My problem was resuelt (I installed  module inits again), now I can see all
modules loaded, but I have problems, when I want to see my backup, I can't ,
I execute tar tvf /dev/st0 and the follwing message appear:
tar: /dev/st0: Cannot open: No such device
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
I believe that my server not know this device, but I  execute lsmod the
driver of my SCSI card is loaded:
scsi_mod              115892  2 dc395x,ide_scsi
I need to know that others test i can do it.
Thanks, You are very kind.
