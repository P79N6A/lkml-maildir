You're correct.

There are several potential MAC processing modes to be added, XCBC-MAC,
OMAC, RMAC etc.  Do you know if any are likely to benefit from a setkey 
method for digests?

Agreed.  I really wanted to keep digests 'pure', and not implement a 
setkey method, but it seems like the simplest way at this stage.

Thanks for the pointer.
