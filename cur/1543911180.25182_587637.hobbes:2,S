I haven't changed anything that would cause such a symptom in the VMA
code... The machine check looks to me like we are accessing a stale
pointer that happens to correspond to some part of IO space that is
mapped but not responding (like PCI PIO space).
I'm travelling (and quite sick too) right now, so I can't really do much
about it at this stage. But it happens early enough that putting a
printk in vma_link_rb() to printk the various pointers involved before
dereferencing them might help.
Cheers,
Ben.
