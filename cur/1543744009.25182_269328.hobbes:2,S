There are certainly work-arounds for problems that shouldn't
exist at all. So, every time I do something to a kernel, I
have to change whatever the EXTRAVERSION field is?  Then, when
a customer demands that the kernel version be exactly the
same that was shipped with Fedora or whatever, I'm screwed.
They simply should not have removed the "-f" option of
insmod. It's just that simple. This option allowed transient
(possible) incompatibilities so that one could be productive
and not spend a whole day reinstalling from a distribution
CD because the new modules wouldn't work because somebody
decided that their special VERMAGIC_STRING was so ")@*&#$%)"
important that they preempted my work. Don't get me started....
Cheers,
