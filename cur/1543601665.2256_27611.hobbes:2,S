Hi Robert
First the good news.
Even my most ugly ideas where not able to crash your preemtible 2.4.10-pre10-xfs
But, to be sure i repeated everything, neither latencytest-0.42 nor my own tests could
find a difference with or without the preemptible patch.
I do not know if i can expect a lower latency at this stage of development.
A maximum of 15 msec latency with all the stress, i managed to put on the machine
is not that bad anyway.
The CPU is a 1.1GHz Athlon. I forgot to mention this.
I will continue to test the preempt patches.
Do you want me to test anything special ?
Best Regards
Gerold
