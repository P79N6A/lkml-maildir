Subject: [CFT][PATCH] procfs cleanups - round 4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Folks, please help to test this one. It touches a lot of places
and while I think that I've caught all stupid typos... well, I can be
wrong. Please, try it with different configs and see if something in
/proc will break. Patch (against 2.3.13-pre1) lives on
	
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/proc-patch-12.gz
Description:
*	/proc/h8 and proc/net/bmac didn't release their entries upon
		rmmod. Result: oopsen. Fixed.
*	/proc/net/raw6 and /proc/net/udp6 shared the inumber. Fixed.
*	rmmod ax25 released /proc/net/ax25_route twice. Fixed.
*	symbolectomy: proc_net_file_operations is no more.
	Rationale: it's identical to proc_file_file_operations, which
		is what proc_register defaults to. So proc_net_file_operations
		in the intializers had been replaced with NULL.
*	new functions:
		create_proc_info_entry(name, mode, base, get_info)
			creates an entry with given name and mode under
			the directory base and sets ->get_info() method.
			mode defaults to S_IFREG|S_IRUSR. base defaults to
			root of procfs.
		create_proc_read_entry(name, mode, base, read_proc, data)
			same as above, but sets ->read_proc() and ->data.
		proc_net_create(name, mode, get_info)
			same as create_proc_info_entry, uses /proc/net and base;
			the most common case in net/*/*.c
		proc_net_remove(name)
			removes name from /proc/net
*	lots of places switched from explicit calls of proc_{un}register()
		to those functions.
	Rationale: cleanus up a lot of mess, reduces the number of places that
		have to know proc_dir_entry layout.
*	proc_array_file_operations are used only for per-process stuff. Old
		system-wide stuff that used to use it moved to generic
		scheme.
	Rationale: those entries were the last remnants of old scheme and
		they gave a lot of unneeded ad-hackery. They are not different
		from /proc/net/ stuff, etc. And their initialization gave
		a lot of clutter in fs/proc/root.c
*	fs/proc/net.c is no more. It was dead since 2.1.21, time to bury it.
*	fs/proc/array.c is only for per-process stuff now. The rest had been
		moved to fs/proc/proc_misc.c, together with the initialization.
*	proc_root_fs, proc_mca and proc_sys_root became pointers.
	Rationale: no reason to keep them static; other /proc subdirectories
		are dynamic now.
*	Most of the stuff in procfs doesn't have fixed inumbers now. Exceptions:
		SCSI stuff, MCA stuff and PROC_NET_IP_MASQ_APP (the latter can
		go right now, the rest is slightly trickier) + per-process
		stuff.
