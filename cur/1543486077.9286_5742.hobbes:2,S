Subject: ncr53c8xx patch for 2.2.1 and not for pre-2.2.2-4

I have attached to this mail a patch for the ncr53c8xx driver that applied
to linux-2.2.1, but that will fail or break the driver of pre-2.2.2-4. A
patch that fixes a 64 bit PCI address register problem for the 896 has
been included in pre-2.2.2-4 despite that I said that I was preparing
another one that addressed the same problem.
I haven't time, at the moment, to fix my patch for 2.2.2-4. So, people who
may want to give a try to the attached patch will have to revert the
driver changes that come with pre-2.2.2-4 and then apply the one included
in this mail.
Regards,
   Gérard.
