Except for the ones that get garbage collected after each new kernel
release WHEN THE VALIDITY OF THE QUEUE IS RECHECKED. Which will catch all
the duplicates or conflicts that were queued but not applied. See original
pseudo-code (which happened to be Python). And filtering by checking for
apply/compile was only half of the original suggestion.

The original suggestion (about the possibility of compile-testing patches
incrementally) was dependent on kbuild and CML2 being in the kernel
already, but I do have a proof-of-concept for the rest in the works.
