I had ftrace in mind but it has not hit mainline yet.
But will do before this patchset does.

If there will be multiple implmentations of the same prototype
we generally recommend to stick the comment in a .H file.
But otherwise keep it close to the source it describe with the
minimal hope that it gets updated.
Oh - and we do not distribute a stripped down headers only
version of the kernel. Users will see full kernel source.
