Write two writel() inside a spinlock to avoid any transactions in the
middle (the HW I'm dealing with can deal with two 32-bit transactions,
as long as nothing comes in the middle).  If your hardware demands a
single 64-bit transaction, you may be in trouble, because I'm not sure
all 32-bit systems can generate such a PCIe transaction.
You can see include/linux/mlx4/doorbell.h for exactly what I did.
