I see your point. This can be prevented by saving and restoring regs->ip
around the post_handler() call, no ? Current code is beautiful. Saving and
restoring regs->ip would make this place look ugly.
Otoh, if the post_handler() wants to crash the kernel, it can do it
in thousand ways, not just by trashing regs->ip, no ?
