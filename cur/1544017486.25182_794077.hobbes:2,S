Actually, there's very little duplicated code, but what there is we can
unify.  The reason it duplicates the API is because it has to provide a
different implementation for voyager ... it's not a PC x86 architecture.

Er, well, yes.  Current setup_per_cpu_areas is setting up the cpu<->apic
maps.  Voyager has no apics, so it has no use for any of the arrays
being set up in there.
If you're proposing to add arrays that would actually be useful to
voyager, then sure we can use it ... it's just at the moment there's no
need.   What is it you want to add in there?
