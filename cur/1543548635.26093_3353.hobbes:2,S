Oh, but init loses its controlling tty very early in the game, so that's
not a major issue. Sure, you can probably win the race, but if you have
access to the console keyboard at the time init is starting, you might as
well press ctrl-alt-del and be done with it.
On the other hand, if you replace init with a shell you definitely want it
to get SIGINT's.

Good to hear that. In the meantime, the patch will save me from cursing
myself and having to freeze in the machine room searching for the right
reset button, after having started a ping on a control-less serial
console. :-)
