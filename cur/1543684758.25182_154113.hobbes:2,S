This was also on my mind, yes. As Wichert said, not all holes are closed
then, there is also /dev/microcode, iopl() and more.
However, perhaps we could all sweep them under the "don't allow userspace to
touch kernel memory easily" banner?
We can leave more finegrained tools to outside patchsets then.
I think root will always be able to figure out a way to get into the
kernel's innards, but we can raise the bar quite a lot easily without too
much infrastructure.
As to what Alan said about LSM, I've yet to see how to do that in a
reasonable way. But I didn't look too hard.
As to what Andries said, how about '/proc/sys/raw_memory_access'?
Thanks.
