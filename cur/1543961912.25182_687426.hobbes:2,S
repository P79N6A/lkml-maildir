i really only focused on pr_debug()/dev_dbg(), with an eye towards
widening the scope as we go...but I agree that it would be nice to
understand the scope for the start...i find ~5000 call sites to
dprintk(), which would be ideal candidates for this type of
infrastructure.

that's correct. the way i've handled this in the patch is:
if DEBUG 
	you get the current compiled in behavior per .c file
elif DYNAMIC_PRINTK
	you get the dynamic runtime configurable debugging
else
	its compiled out

right, i think though it could easily be extended to level control.
Basically the patch associates the on/off per KBUILD_MODNAME, however we
could also associate a level per KBUILD_MODNAME. This level could be set
either by the generic debugfs interface, via module parameters at module
load time, or in the the module __init sections as appropriate.

hmmm...i think this is handled by having the driver call the conditions
in its scope and then call out to the generic infrastructure if the
conditions are met.

ok. i'll take a more detailed look at the pontentially wider scope of this change.
