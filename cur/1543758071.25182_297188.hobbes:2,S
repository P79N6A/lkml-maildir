Subject: [-mm patch] net/ieee80211/Kconfig: don't describe what gets selected
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/24/253

The information what gets selected doesn't belong into the helh text 
(and at least "make menuconfig" already displays this information).
