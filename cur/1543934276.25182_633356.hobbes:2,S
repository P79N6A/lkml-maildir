thanks, that's really useful! I dont see anything obviously wrong with 
the commit though, and cannot (yet) reproduce it, so to help us track it 
down further, could you try to figure out the lockup site? Does the NMI 
watchdog work on your box?
if the NMI watchdog does not work, can you reproduce it on a VGA 
console? If yes, then running the app that does the hard lockup via 
"strace -f <app>" could perhaps show us the last system call that 
happened before the box locked up. If we are lucky it's something 
specific.
here's the guilty commit from latest x86.git#mm:
