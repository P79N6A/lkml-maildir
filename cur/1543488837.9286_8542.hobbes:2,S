This will be of no help to you whatsoever but I'm in a replying kinda
mood. I had this exact same problem. This was with a glibc 2.0.10x
version and I had recompiled ncurses. make menuconfig would not work.
Period.
Eventually, I wound up trying it remotely (via telnet due to being out
of the city at the time) and it worked. And it has worked ever since,
despite multiple ncurses installs.

This, I've never had happen.
