The z990 isn't really crypto hw in the traditional sense, it has special
instructions in the CPU so from Linux POV it's more an extremly optimized
SW implementation..
And we have to solve this anyway even iof support for external crypto
hw is delayed.  Think of integrating Jari's x86 assembly aes implementation
or similar things.
