Hi!
I wonder if somebody could help me with that.
I got HP Pavillion ZE4101 with ATI U1 / ALI 1535+ chipset
and CardBus controller O2Micro 6912 (according to book)
or 6972 (according to lspci).
The machine locks up solid durin i82365.o module insertion with message:
i82365.c 1.352 2002/06/29 06:23:09 (David Hinds)
Intel ISA/OCU/CardBus PCIC probe:
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:0a.0
IRQ routing conflict for 00:0a.0, have irq 5, want irq 11
 02Micro 0Z6912 rev 00 PCI-to_Cardbus at slot 00:0a, mem 0x80000000
   host optos [0]: [pci/way] [pci irq 5] [lat 32/32] [bus 2/5]
At line:
cb_writel(s, CB_SOCKET_FORCE, CB_SE_CSTSCHG);  # in i82365.c
I read hundreds of messages on pcmcia-cs list and I did some
experimentation described here:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=757551&forum_id=7049
and here:
http://forums.itrc.hp.com/cm/QuestionAnswer/1,,0xa15ec1c4ceddd61190050090279cd0f9,00.html
Finally I got reply from David Hinds telling me that this
is a BIOS issue and I should e-mail HP (what I did) and
post here.
I tried debugging but the device numbers shown by lspci are
different from ones which I printk in pci-irq.c
Also IRQs given are different than in Windows.
Could someobody help me with that?
BR,
Jacek
