Ok. That's all I wanted to hear.
So _definitely_ all spinlocks needs "memory" in the clobber list.
I'll do a new patch reinserting "memory" in __sti and inserting
"memory" also in the spin_unlock() case.
The reason of my doubt was that I only got one agreement by Pavel and none
other comment. Furthmore in practice there was no miscompilation thus I
was wondering if I misunderstood the semantics of __volatile__ (but then
of course I was asking myself what "memory" was good for :))

I understand this completly. And as said we can't do that with the
spinlocks (at least with the current API to spin_lock and friends) thus we
need "memory" in the clobber list.

Indeed :). If we could teach all the memory changes to the inline assembly
then "memory" wouldn't be necessary anymore into the clobber list.
