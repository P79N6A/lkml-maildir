The use case would be small code snippets to benchmark some code
or instructions. That normally can't be done with a external
tool and exec'ing something would be quite awkward. Also 
I would like to allow this for normal users.
The performance counters definitely share some properties with TSC already -
they definitely won't be synced (because they don't tick in C states etc.)
so if you change CPUs they won't be monotone.
But I doubt we'll ever see them running at a different frequency than
the current P state, which is the big problem RDTSC has now and that's
why I'm looking for a replacement. That it's faster on P4 is just
a bonus.
However it looks like everybody except me hates the idea :/ Or perhaps
a lot of the opposition was just against the reasonable position
that profiling should not disturb the NMI watchdogs. I guess not
everybody values debuggable kernel dumps.
