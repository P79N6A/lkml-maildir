That should be fine.
I'll soon propose a notifier for the console writes too, same story.

I'm working on it.  The problem is that the current code quality is
still far from mainline requirements (though improving over time).  This
hook (and the other one I'll post) is a step toward merging.  If these
hooks can go mainline, then great, that will make life easier for the
few distributions that want to provide speakup as modules.  If they
remain in -mm for some time and people don't complain, well that's good
too: at least we know how speakup may hook into the kernel when it gets
merged.
Working on braille support is also in my plan BTW.
