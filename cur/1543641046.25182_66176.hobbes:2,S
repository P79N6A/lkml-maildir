The solution is ACPI. Full ACPI. What is the problem? I have devoted too
much time already to make  hybrid ACPI/MPS combos work, but that will never
be the right solution.
Please have your customers email me privately and tell me why ~100KB of mem
on a 1GB+ system is something us engineers should spend our valuable time
hacking around, when the correct solution already is implemented and
*works*.
