Not sure exactly what you mean by one process waiting for ownership
in a yield loop, but why don't you simply allow the queue "owner" to
submit up to a maximum of N requests within a time limit. Once either
limit expires (or, rarely, another might become owner -) the process
would just be put to sleep by the normal queue_full mechanism.

Yeah, something like that. I think that in a queue full situation,
the processes are wanting to submit more than 1 request though. So
the better thoughput you can achieve by batching translates to
better effective throughput. Read my recent debate with Andrea
about this though - I couldn't convince him!
I have seen much better maximum latencies, 2-3 times the
throughput, and an order of magnitude less context switching on
many threaded tiobench write loads when using batching.
In short, measuring get_request latency won't give you the full
story.

No, the numbers (batch # requests, batch time) are not highly scientific.
Simply when a process wakes up, we'll let them submit a small burst of
requests before they go back to sleep. Now in 2.5 (mm) we can cheat and
make this more effective, fair, and without possible missed wakes because
io contexts means that multiple processes can be batching at the same
time, and dynamically allocated requests means it doesn't matter if we
go a bit over the queue limit.
I think a decent solution for 2.4 would be to simply have the one queue
owner, but he allowed the queue to fall below the batch limit, wake
someone else and make them the owner. It can be a bit less fair, and
it doesn't work across queues, but they're less important cases.

No, there are a couple of problems here.
First, good locality != sequential. I saw tiobench 256 random write
throughput _doubled_ because each process is writing within its own
file.
Second, mergeable doesn't mean anything if your request size only
grows to say 128KB (IDE). I saw tiobench 256 sequential writes on IDE
go from ~ 25% peak throughput to ~70% (4.85->14.11 from 20MB/s disk)
Third, context switch rate. In the latest IBM regression tests,
tiobench 64 on ext2, 8xSMP (so don't look at throughput!), average
cs/s was about 2500 with mainline (FIFO request allocation), and
140 in mm (batching allocation). So nearly 20x better. This might
not be due to batching alone, but I didn't see any other obvious
change in mm.

The changes do seem to be a critical fix due to the starvation issue,
but I'm worried that they take a big step back in performance under
high disk load. I found my FIFO mechanism to be unacceptably slow for
2.5.
