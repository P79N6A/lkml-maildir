I loaded the patches on my ppc64 box and they worked fine after I fixed a compile
bug. The attached patch fixes the compile bug and changes the call_usermodehelper
call in kset_hotplug to call_usermodehelper_async.

Fixes a compile error in call_usermodehelper_async and changes kset_hotplug 
to use call_usermodehelper_async, since it is called with a semaphore held,
which can result in a deadlock.
