So we tell users "Even if you protectted half of mmap's space, but you must to register all space to 
kernel. " ?
The image about my test code's result:

A+B  mmap's space
A    sigaltstack
B    protectted
I agree that if register A+B to kernel, the wraparound will stop.
But if register A to kernel, why not kernel do something?
