Here is a snippet from dmesg output for a successful kexec e100 boot:
Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver - version 2.2.21-k1
Copyright (c) 2003 Intel Corporation
e100: selftest OK.
Freeing alive device c1b23000, eth%d
e100: eth0: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Connection
  Hardware receive checksums enabled
  cpu cycle saver enabled
I booted the e100 2.5.68-mm4 kernel twice with kexec, initially from the
eepro100 version, and once from the e100 version.  Both worked OK.
