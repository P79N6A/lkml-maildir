Uhm, that shows that you don't have _any_ idea what's going on in the
automation field. IBM is an IT company, and Intel is a processor
manufacturer. We are talking about the world of signal processors and PLCs
here, where companies like Siemens, ABB, Schneider etc. are the big
players.

Not correct.

You would be wondering how fast you can port an application for another
RTOS to RTAI. There is even a module for RTAI/LXRT which lets you run
Matlab/RTW code natively on RTAI...
