Hi, i posted a bug about amd hanging at boot time a few week ago,
does anybody has a fix for it ?
The bug is described here :
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90902
it seems that several groups of users besides me encounter the same
bug....
If not, i'll have to post-install a 2.4.18 kernel on all my new
RH9 boxes :-(
