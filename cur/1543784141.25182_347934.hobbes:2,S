Hi,

not all Windows users do not know what they are doing :-).
Speaking for myself: I am programming under Linux and
Windows (with more than 10 years experience in C and C++)
and I do know the differences. So please do not call
people idiots only because the are writing software under
Windows.

So if I compile a library with gcc and link the code to a g++
program, the complete program gets compiled with the C++ compiler?
Interesting :-).

To support mixed code, because otherwise e.g. a C++ compiler cannot
use a library compiled with a C compiler.

When you develop a complete product consisting of the embedded
firmware, the driver, and the user space software, you always have
to decide, where to put the code. And in such a case it is really
nice, when you can use the same language in all layers.

This applies for all languages. If you do not know, what you are doing,
you can write really awful code. And I cannot agree, that C++ results to
larger code.

If you are an experienced OO programmer, you do not want to use
languages like plain C, because they result into worse code and
make life more difficult. If you do not like any kind of abstraction,
why are you using C instead of pure assembler?

A lot of code (backend code) does not need any access to
libraries/interfaces.

At the moment you really need all the code to control all variants of
the hardware. Yes, it is not a good design. We know it, our customer
knows it, but at the moment we have to live with the situation.

Can you estimate what such a redesign would cost our customers?
You would need several years to redesign the concept.
