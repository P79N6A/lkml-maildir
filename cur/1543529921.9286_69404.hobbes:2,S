You can compile it anywhere you can run gcc (and gcc runs in a lot of
places).  Using any other compiler than gcc is going to be hopeless.

Using a gcc on the native OS of the new architecture or using a gcc
cross compiler on another architecture.  I.e. before Linux can run on a
new architecture gcc and binutils already have to support it.
