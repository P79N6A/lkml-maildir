Alas, It sort-of boots but is terminally slow. I see the log with 
endless repetitions of "irq 18 nobody cared" and some trace, then 
"disabling irq 18." Unfortunately it lies, after about 20MB of this I 
decided it had no real intention of disabling irq 18 and tried to stop 
it. After ten minutes I had to pull the plug and it's still cleaning 
filesystems.
I will dig through the log after it gets back up, but there is clearly a 
problem in the logic to ignore garbage irq's, or at least stop whining. 
If there is any similarity between the traces I'll post, but I suspect 
that it was one of those edge vs. level things by the behaviour.
Just a warning in case others are seeing a failure of irq disable to 
actually work.
