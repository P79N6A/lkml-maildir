Most common for disk devices is XXYZ where XX is some name for the
driver (hd for ide, sd for scsi, other things for other drive types), Y
is a letter (a for first, b for second, c for third, etc) and Z is the
partition number.  So in your case you could have:
tfaa for first slot
tfaa1 for first partition on first slot.
tfab for second slot
tfab4 for 4th partition on second slot.
Or call it tf and use tfa1 tfb4 etc.

Well at least ide and scsi don't care which controller, they still just
name them in order.  You could just use tfa up to tfp for the devices.
That is what I would do unless the seperate controllers really make more
sense to users (counting to slot 16 might be a bit much using letters
for some users).
Maybe tf1a2 for controller 1 slot a partition 2 would be nicer to the
user.  Some raid cards do use /dev/raidname/c1d2p3 for card 1 device 2
partition 3.  Maybe you prefer that arangement.
