Well, MIPS just like other sane architectures has no concept of ioports.
So if there ever is something that's called an ioport on MIPS then it's
really a memory location in a memory address range where other PCish
devices are living, too.  So typically those memory addresses are
translated to an actual ioport access by a PCI bridge.  There are a few
systems where this concept just apply easily such as DECstations, so
there we simply claim the device such as the RTC in this case is memory
mapped.
