I still would like to see the IIS/Apache/iPlanet distribution results
if you only consider the top 1% busiest web servers on this planet.
Yes, there are literally millions of "Apache on <whatever>" driven
servers that get maybe one hit per day. Subtract these and _then_ the
figures are interesting.
While the Netcraft survey is something to <censored> off while reading
(we've beaten M$ _once_ again!), in a business context it is largely
irrelevant.
And even wrong. I know of at least one really busy german (sports) web
site which is shown as "driven by Apache on Linux" but in reality it
is about a dozen IIS on NT4/2000 behind a reverse proxy cluster (which
runs on Linux). I helped building the reverse proxy, so I should know. =:-)
