THIS is interesting.
We had same problems with two absolutely different machines, both equipped with
a single Seagate ST34311A drive. Different mainboards, different kernels (2.2
series), different eth hardware (RealTek and 3c905B), both non-SMP.
I once traced this down in the IDE driver (see archives for the thread) and it
was about a timeout giving the drive time to report activity completion to the
driver. If I raised the timeout, errors got fewer.
This seems to be a problem with ST343* series. Can anyone confirm, that this
drive is a common denominator to the story?
Best regards,
Daniel
