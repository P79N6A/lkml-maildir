Then _get rid of your init.d_.
SysV init sequence is insane.
I use daemontools-based setup and it starts up to login prompt
in 5-10 secs (counting from the root fs mount).
In my setup, after a few simple startup scripts a svscan process
is called, which starts all services in parallel.
Gettys are services, and start right away.
