I do similarly when I am testing Gnome software, but there
I have the CVS sources to look at, including carefully updated
ChangeLog files.  I find the ChangeLogs and the output of
"cvs log ChangeLog" to be highly informative and helpful when
attempting to track down the appropriate person to contact.
Is it feasible to set up a read-only anonymous cvs server for
the kernel tree?  It seems to me that it would be nice to 
good to have ChangeLogs for the kernel directories as well.
