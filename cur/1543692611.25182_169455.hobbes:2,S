And just for the record, as a matter of taste I'd like to see all #ifdefs in
structs to disappear, look at what I did to struct sock in 2.5 and look at
struct sock (include/net/sock.h) in 2.4: no #ifdefs where there was a ton,
what I disagree is to make IPV6 not to be built as a module, that would harm
generic kernels, what I said was that this has to be fixed properly, this
requires time and we are too late in 2.6 for such bigger changes, as this is
not just #ifdefs in structs, it is #ifdefs in the IPV4 code, etc.
Lets revisit this in 2.7.

For the record: I did an audit in 99% of the headers in the linux source tree,
#ifdefs in structs are mostly just for: CONFIG_PROCFS, DEBUG, NETFILTER and
IPV6, and just a few.
