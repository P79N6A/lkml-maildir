Hi.
In response to a user report that suspend2 was broken when compiled with
gcc 3.4, I upgraded my compiler to 3.4.1-0.1mdk. I've found that the
restore_processor_context, defined as follows:
static inline void restore_processor_context(void)
doesn't get inlined. GCC doesn't complain when compiling the file, and
so far as I can see, there's no reason for it not to inline the routine.
But that leaves me confused because some other inlined functions do seem
to get inlined. Can someone tell me what I'm missing?
Regards,
Nigel
