Thanks. That looks fair enough. My only concern is that io_load performance is 
worse with lower prio_bonus_ratio settings and io loads are the most felt.
I was thinking of changing what it varied. I was going to leave the timeslice 
fixed and use it to change the prio_bonus_ratio under load. Although that 
kind of defeats the purpose of having it in the first place since it is 
supposed to decide what is interactive under load?
