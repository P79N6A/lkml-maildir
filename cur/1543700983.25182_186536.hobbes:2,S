I think the behavior of Win2k and WinXP is different for removable
devices.  Win2k seems to use async writes, and complains a lot if you
remove them without stopping.  XP seems to use sync writes, and doesn't
tend to complain much.
I haven't seen either one crash from pulling out flash cards from a card
reader (haven't tried a pen drive or similar).  However, the media
drivers they use for the USB readers sometimes seem to get into a bad
state where they're continually writing until you unplug the device.
