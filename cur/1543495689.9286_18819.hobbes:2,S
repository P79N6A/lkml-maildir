Gentlemen,
I apologize if this is a FAQ -- I have tried a web search, and didn't get much
information on it, so I will assume it is not.
I am in charge of (among much else :) ), three Pentium 2 boxen running a
RedHat 5.2 install patched up to kernel version 2.2.6.  These boxes are
serving as servers for a virtual hosting system, each server having 2 or 3
class C IP blocks assigned to it.
The first two machines we put up are running fine.  However, when I brought
the third one online, it started spewing 'Neighbour table overflow' errors to
the syslog and console.  Upon searching the source, I found the message in
net/ipv4/route.c, function rt_intern_hash().  I have tried to trace the code
back from there, but have failed to determine any cause for the different
behavior in the one machine.
Does anyone have any suggestions for my next step?  Any help would be
appreciated, especially in the form of a direct cc to me, since I only
subscribe to the digest version of the list.
