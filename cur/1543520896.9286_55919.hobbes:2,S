yes, even a lowly Z80 can handle 64 bit quantities.
however, the real problem is all the fileformats (like tar) and fixed
definition structures which will break.  as with y2k, the problem
wasn't in the cpu per se, but in the data storage.

i wish C would get a decent set of integer types.  it was once enough
but now it's no longer the case.
it's silly that int is 32 bits on the alpha since int is supposed to
be whatever comes natural to your cpu, but how else would you cover
the range 8, 16, 32, 64 bits?
if you try to make int be 64 bit, then long and long must
also be 64 or more.  you've got char and short left to cover the
important 8, 16 and 32 bit cases and you are left short (no pun
intended).
i'd also like to see C types with *specified* bit widths, e.g.,
int16, int32, uint8 &c.  then you could write more portable code when
you really need a certain number of bits like for CRC algorithms.  in
case of 36bit computing on a pdp-10 the compiler could at least
complain about lack of 32 bit support (even if it would be easy to
add) instead of silently failing.
