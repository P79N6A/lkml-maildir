Nothing, as long as it works. But the jump target may only be 1<<13
bytes away. With gcov, it is further. syscall_trace is in a different
source file, so the distance can grow quite large.

Does bl leave 25 bits for the jump target? I don't have a ppc manual
or test hardware with me over the holidays. Will check next week.
32MB sounds quite sufficient. My current record is 28MB for vmlinux on
i386, after allyesconfig basically. This is for statical analysis
only, I would think about booting such a monster.

Maybe, but why bother. As long as the patch doesn't go into mainline,
the change is identical for arch/*/kernel/head*.S, which is easy to
understand.
If you think it would still be nicer, I will do the change.
