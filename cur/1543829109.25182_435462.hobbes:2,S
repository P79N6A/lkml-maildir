All you're going to do is piss off all the distros and hardare vendors
shipping systems with this chip in it. Nvidia is not the only "vendor"
involved, and is not the only one doing hardware validation. Sun, HP,
Newisys, and LNXI all have currently shipping Opteron products with a
CK804.  All 4 are probably going to want your employer's distro to not
disable MSI.
