The competition has changed, it is about being fast, not about doing
something somebody else cannot do.

The compiler will most certainly not break good design of your C source,
even if the optimizer changes. The actual compiler itself (which is
input independent and machine indepent except for inline assembly code)
which does the global optimizations has not changed a lot. Loop
unrolling, dependence detection and things don't change a lot in the way
they work.
