Subject: xconfig and menuconfig no longer work

I've suddenly encountered problems with "make menuconfig" and "make
xconfig". These always worked perfectly previously on 2.4.18. I now get it on
2.4.18 and 2.4.19.
Now, "make menuconfig" gives a message saying:
	Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the
	kernel's configuration files and is unable to continue. Here is
	the error report: [there is no report]
And "make xconfig" fails with the message:
	.tkparse: Permission denied
This happens even as root.
To make matters even more puzzling, these problems occur only on my
laptop; both work on my desktop. Both machines are running Debian
(testing).
Any suggestions gratefully received; please reply by email as I am not
on the list at present.
Anthony
