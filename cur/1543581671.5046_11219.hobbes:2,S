Chris, your quoting is very confusing above..... but I get your very interesting
remark (thanks for noticing) that the nulls are specific to crashes on 2.2, and
therefor could be due to the elevator bug on 2.4.  It even makes rough sense
that the elevator bug (said to occasionally cause a premature write of the wrong
buffer) could cause an effect similar to a crash.  I hope it is true, let's ask
all users to upgrade to pre2 (a good idea anyway) and see if it cures.
zam is perhaps very clever for deferring working on this bug......:-)
