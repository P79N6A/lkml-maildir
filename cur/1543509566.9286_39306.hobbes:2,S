AFIK Linus removed such &init_mm thing because tsk->mm == 0 is more
regular in his opinion.
The tsk->mm == 0 thing Oopses because the i386 version of
__flush_one_page() is buggy (and my patch fixes the bug). With the bug
fixed the new tsk->mm == 0 logic (should) work fine on i386 too without
further changes. And just to avoid mistakes: with "i386" this time I mean
a real 386 and not a 486 or Pentium with the invlpg instruction ;).
As last thing tsk->mm == 0 is faster as the asm doesn't need to play with
the &init_mm address (the zero version will work with a plain testl on the
tsk->mm value).
