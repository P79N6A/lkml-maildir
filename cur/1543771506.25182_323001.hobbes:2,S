I meant this driver does not need hotplug per say and just a copy should
be enough (if we decide to go with bin attribute for data file).

At what point I should be calling request_firmware? As my driver does
not have any entry points. In this driver it is called when the user is
ready to download the firmware image (when it echoes the firmware image
name). Also the driver needs to be resident for handling multiple such
requests; that's why cannot do this at driver init time.
When ever the user echoes the file name, it gets passed on to
request_firmware and the $FIRMWARE env gets populated with the file
name. thus making the hotplug code to automatically load the image which
is passed back as fw->data and fw->size.

The file name can be same (hardcode) for every update; but writing the
file name was a way to get the user start the update process.
