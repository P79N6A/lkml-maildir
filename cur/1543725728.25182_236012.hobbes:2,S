I repeated the test with 'bonnie -f' and without jackd running, and with
32KB vs. 1024KB.  The results are not as drastic, which suggests that
all the overhead from the XRUN tracing was a factor.
These results show that 32KB is better than 1024KB in some areas, and
not singificantly worse in any of these metrics.
32KB:
