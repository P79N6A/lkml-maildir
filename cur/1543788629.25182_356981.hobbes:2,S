Thanks, that got it going. 
The problems I was seeing with Jack are still there but there's more
weird behavior. 
X will blank the screen randomly, sometimes it takes a while till I can
get it back, sometimes it is a blink, sometimes longer, and typing in a
terminal under X will repeat keys (that does not happen in a text
console terminal). This is on Fedora Core 4 with the latest updates
installed. 
This appears to be triggered from Freqtweak (a Jack application):
