I will not.
I state that the newer 'C' versions are using LEA abitrarily for
arithmetic on index registers.
I write a demo that clearly shows that LEA cannot be abitrarily used
for aritmetic on an index register.
You, for some unknown reason declare the demo invalid while it clearly
is designed to emphasize the problem and demonstrate it.
So back off!
Cheers,
