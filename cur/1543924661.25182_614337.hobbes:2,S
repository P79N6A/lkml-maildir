Hi.
I'm pleased to announce 7'th and the final release of the distributed
storage subsystem (DST). It allows to form a storage on top of local and
remote nodes and combine them in linear or mirroring setup, which in
turn can be exported to remote nodes.
Short changelog:
* added strong checksum support (Castagnoli crc)
* extended autoconfiguration (added ability to request if remote
	side supports strong checksum and turn it on if needed)
* documentation addon - sysfs files
* added clean/dirty sysfs files which allows to mark
	node as clean (sinc) or dirty (not sync)
* fair number of bug fixes (including really tricky
	bastards, which are unlikely to be found in real
	setups, but which were still bugs)
* and the main one - added release name (it clearly shows my condition)
Overall list of features of the DST can be found on project's homepage:

Thank you.
