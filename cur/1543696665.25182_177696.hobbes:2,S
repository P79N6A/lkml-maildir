Ok, that's just strange. You can't even _read_ from the raw device, but 
the mount works ok?
And you got no IO errors anywhere? I don't see why the write would fail 
silently.
I wonder whether the disk capacity is set to zero. See 
drivers/ide/ide-cd.c, and in particular the 
        /* Now try to get the total cdrom capacity. */
        stat = cdrom_get_last_written(cdi, (long *) &toc->capacity);
        if (stat || !toc->capacity)
                stat = cdrom_read_capacity(drive, &toc->capacity, sense);
        if (stat)
                toc->capacity = 0x1fffff;
and see what that says.. I really think you should start sprinkling 
printk's around the thing to determine what goes on..
