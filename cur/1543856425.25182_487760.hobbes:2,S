Hi.
I have a Plextor PX-760A DVD/CD drive,.. and some days ago I've updated
to firmaware 1.05 (which is the most recent).
Since that I have problems reading many DVDs but this is not what I'm
asking here....
Some of the DVD-Videos work and I watched one some minutes ago.
Suddenly the soundoutput went crazy... totally disturbed with lots of
very high tones.
The crazy sound didn't stop although that may be bacause xine was locked
and I could not quit it,... I halted my system and after reboot the
crazy sound was away.
dmesg shows this:
Dec  3 04:12:16 euler kernel: hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Dec  3 04:12:16 euler kernel: ide: failed opcode was: unknown

Any idea what the reason is? Could it be the firmware? Or a hardware
damage (if so which hardware is likely?)?
And what is tha lost ticks? How would a defect DVD/CD drive has
influence on the ticks (if that means CPU ticks).
Thanks,
Chris.
