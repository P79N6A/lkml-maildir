Given that we perform both the 0-length check and the file operations
check for every successful mmap(), changing the order of the two tests
shouldn't have any performance impact.  All it does is guarantee that
the error returned for mmap on an invalid fd is ENODEV regardless of the
other parameters passed in, which seems a perfectly sane thing to do
anyway.
