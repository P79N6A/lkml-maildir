Oh yes my mistake was that GFS for kernel 2.2 require a lfs patch and I
had in mind that it was this patch that requires 64bits arithmetics.
But this is definitevly not the case (otherwise this should be compiled
in the kernel and not as a module).
Then your module (divdi3.o I guess) is enough for the need of the
original poster of this thread.
But the best thing to do for him is to rewrite his module to avoid
these 64bits operations.
As a side note, I was a contributor for this part of GFS and Sistina
never contacted me to ask me to give them my right before their
relicensing. But perhaps they have dropped the ppc support.
