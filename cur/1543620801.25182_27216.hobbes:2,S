Yes, the first time I used "bk send" to send something directly to Ted it
happened that I was offline so I looked into my mail spool at the emails
and also hated it.  What I was proposing instead of just "bk send" is to
prepend the changelog entry, a real unified diff, and gzip_uu CSET at the
end.  Larry has agreed that "bk send -d -wgzip_uu" wrapping the diff part
of the patch is a bug to be fixed.
So, instead of the current layout of "'This is a BitKeeper patch' comment +
commented-out diff + BK stuff", I would send "CSET ChangeLog + unified diff +
gzip_uu wrapped BK stuff".  This would be the output of (probably in a script):
bk changes -r<rev>
bk export -tpatch -h -du -r<rev>
bk send -wgzip_uu -r<rev> -
For example, your recent 2.5.4 release would look like the below, and I
_think_ you could just accept this with "bk receive -a [repository path]",
but I'm not sure how good the BK heuristics are for finding a CSET at the
end of a long patch.  I'm only skeptical because the current "bk send"
output comments out the diff part of the output.
