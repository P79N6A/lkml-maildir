We don't want to be rewriting any interpreters.  New options are not an
option (as it were).

No, /proc/self/fd/3 is not an ordinary symlink although it looks like
one to `ls'.  It always reopens the correct file.  Programs do not have
to be changed, and it doesn't have the same race condition as passing
the filename.

Why would the interpreters need rewriting?

The point of /proc/self/script is that no fd is allocated until it is
opened -- for interpreters that expect the next free fd to be number 3.
Yes I would add it to struct task.

If you're going to reserve fd number 3, /proc/self/fd/3 is exactly the
right way to refer to this.  Of course opening it returns fd 4, but
that's not so bad is it?
