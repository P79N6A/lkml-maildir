I didn't say that at all! But since I'm the one maintaining that code,
it makes sense that it's easiest for me to read, since I'm the most
frequent reader (and writer).
But that's beside the point. Linus has stated that he doesn't want to
force coding style upon others, unless it's something that he has to
maintain. Since he doesn't maintain devfs, that doesn't apply.
If Linus makes the decision to change that policy, and *force* all
code into the one style, I'll have to put up with that, although I'll
grumble. And I'll scream blue murder if it's just *my* code that gets
changed; I note that not all of the kernel conforms to Linus'
preferred style. Right now I feel picked on.
