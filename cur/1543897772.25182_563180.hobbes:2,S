There's more potential to cause  lines end with whitespace. How about
remove the "Some editors with ..."  like this :
+Do not leave trailing whitespace at the ends of lines.
+
+Git will warn you about patches that introduce trailing whitespace, and can
+optionally strip the trailing whitespace for you; however, if applying a series
+of patches, this may make later patches in the series fail by changing their
+context lines.
