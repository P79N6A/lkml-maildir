	I'm sorry, that's an absolutely preposterous view. For one thing, Linux
violates this by allowing processes and threads to share file descriptors
(since another process can steal the data before the call to 'recvmsg'). Oh
well, I guess we'll have to take that out if we want to comply with POSIX on
'select' semantics.

	Again, I think this is an absurd reading of the standard. No other status
function provides a future guarantee. And it's semantically ugly to have
'select' change the status of network data when it's purely intended to be a
'get status' function.

	This is only because you interpret the standard as providing a future
guarantee that it is literally impossible for any modern operating system to
provide. I certainly don't interpret the standard that way. Look up the word
'would' in the dictionary.
	Linux does in fact make the decision to discard the data *after* the call
to 'select'. This is not in any way different from another process that
shared the file descriptor consuming the data after the call to 'select'.
