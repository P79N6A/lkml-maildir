Using the latest version of the patch on do_syscall_trace(), it still
doesn't work unless I remove this test.  If indeed it's supposed to
fall through to receive the proper signal, (ie to single step properly
after an int op), then removing it is wrong, and I won't consider it
anymore.  I also have to use the patch shown below, with a typo-fixed,
to fix the other problem.  I broke it apart from the other because we
might want to consider it seperately right now.
I spent some time speaking to my brother about this.  He has done his
own kernel before for an embedded system.  He was rather frustrated
with me trying to find a reason for why a rather simple change broke
my program.  He told me I couldn't have it both ways.  However I
believe that I don't understand the linux code well enough to make
that conclusion.

Actually, I don't think the vanilla kernel has the code that breaks
those other wine programs.  I just learned of this yesterday and it's
not related.  I believe it's only in fedora core 3 or -ac kernels and 
I use vanilla kernels.
