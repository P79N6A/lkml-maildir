Please cc: me on responses and follow-ups since I'm not subscribed. I
am willing and able to test patches. I searched the archives but
haven't really seen anything about this.
I have a number of Compaq DL3x0 machines which are SMP PentiumIII's in
single and dual-cpu configurations. With 2.4.23 sources I built SMP
kernels and booted them just fine on UP boxes. Apparently no more. This
is the output I get upon SMP kernel load on a UP box:
<begin>

Looking at arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c line 1098'ish seems to imply that
the code hasn't detected that this is a UP box up about a dozen lines
where "if (!max_cpus) ... smp_num_cpus = 1; goto smp_done" if not
rather earlier in the process.
The only way I got a kernel that would work is if I set SMP=n and built
a UP-only kernel. Enabling UP-APIC was not a problem. I booted the ROM
setup to check bios settings and everything checked out on that end.
