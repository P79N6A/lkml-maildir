The dcache flushes are necessary before the page is mapped, to keep
track which pages we need to flush from the kernel address space
during the page fault right before we map them into userspace (i.e.
during flush_icache_page). We're not really flushing the cache there, we
only keeps track of it through the arch bitflag.
