Ok, I've just put up 2.5.49 tarballs, .sign's, and patches of the
.gz and .bz2 varieties at:
  
ftp://zeniiia.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5
  
ftp://zeniii.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5
  
http://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5
  
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5
That's 3 machines at two ISPs in the UK, both all with 100mbit bandwidth
to the outside world.
(People behind windows routers may have problems with zeniii.linux.org.uk)
I'd like to thank Andre Hedrick for retrieving these files and thereby
making this possible.
