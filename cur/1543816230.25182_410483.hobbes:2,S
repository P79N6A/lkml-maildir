Not the right size; the u32 covers the V part of TLV. The T = 16 bits
and L = 16 bits. And if you nest TLVs, then it gets more interesting.
Look at using proper macros instead of hard coding like you did.
grep for something like RTA_SPACE and perhaps send a patch to make it
generic for netlink.h
cheers,
