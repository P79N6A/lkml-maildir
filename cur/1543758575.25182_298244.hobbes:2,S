Sorry, I wasn't clear in the previous email; I did try the card= option 
anyway.  I wrote a looping script and tested first 70 card= options, and 
none worked properly for streaming capture.  Some did show different 
behavior though.  I might try the remaining 50 later today.
I did notice one strange thing though; the card= option is only applied 
to the first bttv card.  All remaining cards in the system are still 
autodetected (which ends up assuming card=0 in my case).  Not sure if 
this is the intended behavior or not, since someone really could run two 
different bttv cards in the same system.
