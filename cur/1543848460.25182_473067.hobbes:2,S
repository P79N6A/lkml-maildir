In practice module will not load becasue it cannot resolve symbol - right?
That aside we should not export symbols from lib-y. But I have not any good
idea how to catch this during build time unles doing some ugly grep magic.
One thing that could be done would be to check for a specific section
(__ksymtab_strings) in the .o file only for lib-y .o files.
The check could be something like:
objdump -h <file.o> | grep __ksymtab_strings
If grep give error code '0' then we exported a symbol.
I may try to cook up later this weekend.
