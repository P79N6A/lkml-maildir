It Works For Me (tm).
I have the same problem -- a C++ program that includes kernel header
files -- and your patch does indeed fix my problem.  If it gets into the
kernel then I can take some nasty preprocessor kludges out of my source.
Here's a little background: I have a program like strace, which monitors
the system calls that *other programs* make.  I need to #include
the entire userspace-to-kernel ABI so that I can monitor properly.
Using glibc headers doesn't meet my needs at all, because I am not
calling these services, I am using ptrace to watching other processes
call these services.
I chose to write my program in C++ because I like OO programming.

If you are interested, here is my list of kernel header files that give
me a little trouble:
    linux/if_frad.h		userland interface depends on CONFIG_DLCI
    linux/if_tunnel.h		needs #include <linux/ip.h>
    linux/if_ppp.h		needs #include <linux/ppp_defs.h>
    linux/lp.h			userland interface depends on LP_STATS
    linux/ncp_fs.h		uses reserved word "namespace"
    linux/nfsd/syscall.h	needs __KERNEL__ wrapping
    linux/socket.h		needs cast: "(struct cmsghdr *) NULL"
    linux/videotext.h		uses reserved word "delete"
    linux/zftape.h		userland interface depends on ZFT_OBSOLETE
    scsi/scsi_ioctl.h		Scsi_Device definition hidden inside __KERNEL__
Here is how I test:
    gcc -c -x c++ -include /usr/include/linux/videotext.h /dev/null -o /dev/null
Also there are some bits of the userland interface which are hidden inside
kernel source and not accessible to userland programs.  These bits need to
move into linux/*.h headers so that userland programs can see them.
    drivers/cdrom/cm206.h	some ioctl definitions
    drivers/cdrom/sbpcd.h	some ioctl definitions
    drivers/char/bttv.h		struct bttv_poll_info, BTTV_* ioctls
    druvers/char/buz.h		some ioctl definitions
    drivers/char/pc110pad.h	some ioctl definitions
    drivers/net/wavelan.p.h	some SIOC* ioctl definitions
    drivers/sound/dm.h		some ioctl definitions
    include/net/ax24.h		AX25_ADDR_LEN is visible to user space
				    via some SIOCSIFHWADDR calls
I can live with all this stuff but it would be nice if someone cleaned
this up.  If any of these are controversial, just let the system be,
and I will work around it.
The original "(struct cmsghdr *) NULL" cast shouldn't be controversial
though; it's always correct and makes life easier for a few people.
