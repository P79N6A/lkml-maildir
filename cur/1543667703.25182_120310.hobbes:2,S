Kernel 2.5.66 compiled for 386, running on a K6/250.
I am having trouble burning CDs using an external CD burner (NEC
NR-7800, with "burn-proof", in an external IDE-to-USB case) at 16x and
8x. My USB card is the following:
 Bus  0, device   8, function  0:
    USB Controller: NEC Corporation USB (rev 65).
      IRQ 12.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=1.Max Lat=42.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe8002000 [0xe8002fff]
I can burn CDs reliably from a USB-1.0 card, also at a nominal 16x
(really much slower, of course). With my USB-2.0 card at 16x, about 1
in 10 works; the rest give the following error:

Is there any other debug info that would be useful?
