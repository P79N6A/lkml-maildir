Sorry, that was unclear. I was speaking of a general approach rather than
what would be done in the driver. Clearly that's best done at a higher
level. Drivers should not be making policy decisions of that type, but I
don't think it's good to return a read error caused by data the program
didn't request (ie. readahead).
Unless S.M.A.R.T is lying, that happens so seldom on disk that the
overhead of a retry doesn't matter. And on CD it makes things work where
currently they fail.
