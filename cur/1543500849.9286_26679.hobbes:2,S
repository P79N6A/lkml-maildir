Subject: question about kernel/sched.c - 2.2.10

i definitely have no clue about what is going on inside
the kernel, but i'm trying to learn... 
i was digging around sched.c (2.2.10)in schedule(). i 
noticed a few goto statements that only return below 
where they were called: specifically; handle_bh, 
move_rr_last, and still_running. it _seems_ to me 
that these gotos are not necessary. am i missing the 
point? or is there a benefit in saying 'goto' rather 
than just putting the code right there? help me 
understand.
thanks.
