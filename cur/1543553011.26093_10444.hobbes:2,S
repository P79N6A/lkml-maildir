I don't think so. If you check the code paths more closely, you'll see
that the timer is used even in the fast TSC case, the error causes by
too big 'count' variable propagates up to the TSC routine. That's where
I started hunting for the bug.
So no, it wasn't a placebo effect. Put a printk() in the fix statement
to see if it's triggered.
