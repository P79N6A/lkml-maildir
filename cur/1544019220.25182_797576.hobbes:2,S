yup, well spotted.
It would be good to add a little typesafe wrapper:
static inline struct kern_ipc_perm *shm_idr_find(struct ipc_ids *ipc_ids)
{
	return idr_find(&ipc_ids->ipcs_idr);
}
(or similar)
so that this sort of mistake cannot happen again.
As you've found, open-coded use of a bare void*-returning function is a
bit dangerous.
