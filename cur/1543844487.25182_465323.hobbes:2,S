I think you have a misunderstanding over what ketchup is/does.
It cannot usurp tarballs by its very nature. It retrieves tarballs (if necessary)
and whatever patches are necessary to get to the tree you want.

By unpatching if necessary.

'properly' is the wrong word here. optimally, yes, but the firewall argument
alone isn't sufficient to claim git can't be used to clone a tree.
A tree cloned over http: vs one over git: has exactly the same information in
it. All the history, all the changes. Everything.
