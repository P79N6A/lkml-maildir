of course the right way to do it is to coalesce only if all the
alignments simulates what would happen with a 4k ext2. Now it maybe that
the patch is broken (didn't checked the implementation), but at least
theoretically the merging to save cpu should be doable without breaking
anything and without the need of bio (of course bio can do more than 4k
at once, so it's not nearly as powerful as bio but still it should make a
noticeable difference in the benchmarks).
