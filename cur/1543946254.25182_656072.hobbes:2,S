They don't need to because this stuff basically works and there isn't
much new hardware anymore and no new standards and it also doesn't really
need much tuning.
Or rather the new hardware development (like Asterisk support etc.) 
seemed to be mostly done on out of tree mISDN.

So you're saying anything that has no active maintainer should 
be immediately deleted?
I suspect after you would be done with that a lot of (working) code in Linux
would be gone.
