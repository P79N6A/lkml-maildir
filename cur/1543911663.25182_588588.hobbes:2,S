Adaptive granularity makes a large difference for me on my somewhat
ancient laptop (1200 MHz). When browsing the interweb using firefox (or
trying to) while doing a (non-niced) kbuild -j5 the difference in
interactivity is significant.
[ kbuild -j5 was quite unbearable on 2.6.22 - so CFS is a clear win in
any case ]
The reduced latency is clearly noticable in a much smoother scroll
behaviour. Whereas both still present a usable browsing experience the
clear reduction in latency spikes makes it much more pleasant.
