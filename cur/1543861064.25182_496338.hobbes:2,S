Hello All,
I am looking to use multiple kernel trees on the same distro. Example:-
2.6.19.1 for - software/tools development
2.4.34    for - embedded systems development.
I do know that 2.6 supports embedded in a big way....but still
requirement demands to work with such boards as an example:-
http://www.embeddedarm.com/linux/ARM.htm
My question is HOW-TO enable a distro with multi kernel trees?
Presently am using Fedora Core 5/6 for much of the development
activities (Cell BE SDK related at Labs).
Any hints/suggestions would be a great leap for me to do this on my own.
