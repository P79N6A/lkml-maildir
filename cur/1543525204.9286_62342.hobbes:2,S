I think I found the problem:
acpi tries to ioremap() memory that's just behind the end of the normal
memory:
I have 192 MB ram, and the last few bytes are used for the ACPI tables.
acpi calls ioremap(0xbff3000,36,flags).
high_memory is bff3000 --> remap_area_pages() gets called, but the page
is still mapped by a 2MB pte.
it seems that remap_area_pages() can't handle PSE pages -->
pte_alloc_kernel() calls pmd_bad(), and that function complains.
A few seconds later, the kernel runs into a BUG().
Could someone check what these remap_area_xy() functions should do? The
modifications to phys_address are interesting:
	phys_address -= address;
	[..., no access to phys_address]
	sub_func(,phys_address+address,,);
Without PAE36, the kernel runs smoothly.
