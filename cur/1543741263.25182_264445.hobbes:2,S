I'd say just allocate brand new events for all combinations and do not
worry that the default X keyboard drivers to not get them. There are
already patches in Gentoo adding both keyboard and mouse event support
to X [1] and it is only matter of time ofr other duistributions to pick
it up as well.
I think it is sensible for an supplemental driver (sonypi) to require
some additional support form userspace and not to force itself into
boundaries of a legacy protocol.
