Why's that?

Why's that?  It's rightly been recognized as a library function since
2.6.0-test3.  I'd say it should remain exported for whatever filesystems
might wish to use it (but no, I've no vested interest, the filesystem
you'll suspect me of arguing for does not use it ;)

  [PATCH] export install_page() to modules
  install_page() is a library function which we expect will be used by all
  drivers which implement vm_operations.populate().  Therefore it should be
  exported to kernel modules.
  Petr Vandrovec has a project which involves sparse mappings of device memory
  which can use remap_file_pages().  It needs install_page().
