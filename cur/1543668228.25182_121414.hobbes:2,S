Well - I don't know much about this, but I have some thoughts:
When do these errors occur while burning? At the start or somewhere in the 
middle?
I had LOTS of troubles writing CD's, but every time it was due to incompatible 
Media. So - did you besides changing the glibc also change your CD-Media?
Moreover I somehow wonder - don't you use the ide-scsi module? Which program 
are you using for writing your CDs?
My error messages looked different - first I got errors from the SCSI 
sub-system, second it told some "sense key" and "Media error". The errors 
were somehow more self explaining.
