Didnt you get formatting utilities to repair such situations?
But concerning cylinders: Also harddisks do not have cylinders in the
partition table sense. Disk geometry is a fiction. If you print a
partition table and it looks ugly given one fiction, this just means
that you can invent some other fiction that makes it look nicer.
There is no underlying reality to these cylinder boundaries.
