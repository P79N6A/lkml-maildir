These don't address the problem - if the drive won't go "ready" because
of a blown server platter, your data won't get overwritten but it's still
readable (a number of companies make good money at this).
In general, if the disk is dead enough that you're looking at replacement,
you'll probably not be totally pleased with the results of those programs..

Note that this only works well for single-platter disks - the field
you need to get the *inner* surfaces of the platters, especially for
a 5 or 6 platter disk, is quite astounding....
We ran into this issue recently on one of our Sun servers - Sun *does*
have a program to deal with this, but (a) you have to specifically ask
them and (b) it's additional charge.
