EMBEDDED is the wrong option, since the semantics of embedded is "show 
more options to allow additional space savings". It is not and should 
not be abused as an option to hide random options from users.
Currently, EXPERIMENTAL is nearer to what suits X86_P4_CLOCKMOD, and it 
seems we really need an ADVANCED_USER option for such options.
