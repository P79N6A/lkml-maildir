Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Other important UML fixes for 2.6.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is what I've currently in my tree for 2.6.14. It's not enough to fix all 
regressions (there are still some problems on which Jeff is working right 
now, namely UBD and x86-64 without frame pointers).
This includes the critical fixes for my UML fault handler breakage - this time 
I ran a kernel compile under each UML running mode (last time I couldn't test 
SKAS3) with these patches.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
