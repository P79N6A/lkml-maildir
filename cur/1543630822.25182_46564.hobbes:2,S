Ahh...  excellent!  And finally I can see what the arch-specific logos
actually are.   Do you plan to put something like this into 2.5?
My plan was to prepare a patch for 2.5 after the framebuffer and 
console rewrite (and kbuild 2.5) was done and merged, and then send 
it to you and James...  but maybe you already have your own plans 
for this?
I think it would be great if 2.6 users could easily change the boot 
logo, just by replacing a graphics file before compiling.
