Worse than that.  There is a long list of critical config options which
should :-
(a) Force a complete rebuild if any are changed and
(b) Refuse to load a module with different critical config options.
To make things more complicated, that list is arch dependent.
From kbuild 2.5 (which handled this problem months ago)
define_string CONFIG_KBUILD_CRITICAL "CONFIG_SMP CONFIG_KBUILD_GCC_VERSION"
define_string CONFIG_KBUILD_CRITICAL_ARCH_X86 "CONFIG_M386 CONFIG_M486 \
       CONFIG_M586 CONFIG_M586TSC CONFIG_M586MMX CONFIG_M686 \
       CONFIG_MPENTIUMIII CONFIG_MPENTIUM4 \
       CONFIG_MK6 CONFIG_MK7 \
       CONFIG_MCRUSOE \
       CONFIG_MWINCHIPC6 CONFIG_MWINCHIP2 CONFIG_MWINCHIP3D \
       CONFIG_MCYRIXIII"
