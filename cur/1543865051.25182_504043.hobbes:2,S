if resolution is an issue then i can improve this thing to be based off 
a separate /optional/ hrtimer, thus if it's enabled it could enable 1000 
Hz (and not 1024 Hz) update for the variable. The update resolution 
could be tuned via a sysctl trivially, so everyone could tune the 
resolution of this to the value desired, and could do so runtime.
[ It could also be driven by the database right now: from a thread open 
  /dev/rtc, set it to 1024 HZ, and do a gettimeofday() call in every 
  tick - that will auto-update the timestamp. ]

note that this cost was measured on UP and on older hardware, and the 
cost of having a global 1000 Hz update gets linearly cheaper with the 
increase of CPUs on SMP: because only one such update has to be running. 
The systems those database vendors are interested in typically have a 
fair number of CPUs.
