These changes were to conform to SUS. Also, as Linux/ia32 starts supporting
larger memory etc, apps would like to create larger shm segments, specially
on the upcoming ia64. 
This is an API change, but that is expected during a major release. 
Unfortunately, they end up breaking ABI on current 64bit kernels, but
we do not want to have the ia64 shmget() accept a int size and perpetuate
this limitation.
Alternatives are: create new [sub]syscall numbers, define the shm 
"size" as platform dependent.
Coming to the shmctl(IPC_SET) problem, doesn't gcc pad out the structure
elements on 64 bit compiles to long (8 byte) sized? For shmid_ds, the
first field "shm_perm" fits in 2 longs, the old "shm_segsz" would have
taken up a long too, so all elemtns from "shm_atime" would have had their
offsets preserved. What am I assuming wrong here?
The shminfo breakage is probably unavoidable though ...
I am open to all suggestions towards improving the situation ...
Thanks.
