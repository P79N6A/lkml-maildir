Thanks. In effect, I already post this question in the ndiswrapper list. 
So, they told me that was a problem of USB and of kernel. Then, I'm 
looking for configuration of the kernel, because I compiled the 2.6.19, 
but I no more success. Actually, lsusb recognize, then don't recognize 
the machine a few seconds after. Ndiswrapper can be installed or not, 
that change nothing.
This is the answer from which I was able to touch with you :

If 'lsusb' doesn't see the card, it may indicate problem with your USB host
(either hardware, or host driver or both). You may want to try different
kernels. Until that part works right, ndiswrapper won't be able to 
initialize
the card.
