Thank you john. So far, idle=poll seemed to help, partially.
The time doesn't go backwards for now, it only occasionally skips a 
second, every 2-3 minutes. Is that normal? Not that I have been watching 
seconds very closely at any previous moment, so I can't say if it has 
ever happened before.
And I dont' know if this question can be addressed to you, but can you 
say something about those /proc/interrupts? Why don't I see any 
interrupts except LOC being handled by 2nd CPU core?
Thanks in advance!
Vladimir
