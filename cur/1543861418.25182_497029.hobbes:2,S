That's correct about gcc-3.4.x & gcc-4.1.x about 2.6 tree support.
This means 2.6 supports both gcc versions. Here are the binaries I do
use:-
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/3/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/gcc-3.4.2-6.fc3.i386.rpm
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/3/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/kernel-2.6.9-1.667.i686.rpm
Now issue remains with 2.4 tree. Is it possible to build/install
gcc-4.1.x along with gcc-3.4.x? This is what am trying to figure by
few tests on the FC3 base machine.
Can we call this as backward compatibility?
Any inputs here is helpful :-)

I did understand this, thanks. I have one doubt: Imagine I have
built/installed these:-
2.4.34 & 2.6.20 kernels has these gcc-3.4.x & gcc-4.1.x compilers
built on say FC6 box. Now issue comes when I run an application. How
does it understand which library use?
example:
myArmWireless app. needs gcc-3.4.x, NOT gcc-2.6.x libs on say 2.4.34 kernel.
Will it take automatically? Or we need to pass args to target the
gcc-3.4.x libs?
Hope you guys consider these (my) questions as Novice, because am
trying to figure a design @ How-To build such multi kernel/gcc
systems.
