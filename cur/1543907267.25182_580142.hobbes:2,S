Making flags visible is not the problem.
Making another flag invisible (ATTR_MODE) at the same time _is_.

Yes.  And there would be no problem with that, as long as it would be
breaking the API in a visible way.  It does not do that and that is
unsafe.
The other thing with this change is, that it's generally a good idea
to let the VFS do as much as possible, because then filesystem writers
won't get it wrong.
In this case the suid/sgid check needs to be omitted for _very_ few
filesystems (NFS and fuse).  So it makes sense to leave the check
outside filesystem code, and move it inside only when necessary.

No, just adding a flag does not constitute a backward incompatible
change.
