You're mincing my words. The reason "memory" is on the clobber list is because 
a lock is supposed to synchronize all memory accesses up to that point. It's 
a fence / a barrier, because if the compiler re-orders your loads/stores 
across the lock, you're in trouble. That's exactly what I was pointing out.

A volatile cast lets you prevent the compiler from always treating the 
variable as volatile.

No. Linus already described what some example invalid uses of "volatile" are. 
One example is the very one this whole thread is about - using 'volatile' on 
the declaration of the spinlock counter. That usage is _wrong_, and barrier() 
would not be. (Of course, it doesn't directly apply here, because barrier() 
already existed, by necessity, due to the "memory" clobber. And the lock's 
not done in pure C.)
Volatile originally existed to tell the compiler a variable could change at 
will. Because of reordering, it's almost never sufficient with our modern 
compilers and CPUs. That's precisely where barrier() (and/or its hardware 
equivalents) help in places where 'volatile' is wrong. Your statement is 
additionally wrong because one use-case of memory barriers is to safely write 
lock-free code.
Thanks,
