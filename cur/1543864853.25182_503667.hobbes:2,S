I cannot find where SCSI honours that flag.  James?
And for that matter, even when I patch SCSI so that it *does* honour it,
I don't actually see the flag making it into the SCSI layer from above.
And I don't see where/how the block layer takes care when considering
merge FAILFAST/READA requests with non FAILFAST/READA requests.
To me, it looks perfectly happy to add non-FAILFAST/READA bios
to a FAILFAST request, risking data loss if a lower-layer decides
to honour the FAILFAST/READA flags.
So it's a pretty Good Thing(tm) that SCSI doesn't currently honour it. ;)
