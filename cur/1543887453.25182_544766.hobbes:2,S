Please drop your version of the DS1682 patch, and refresh my
jdelvare-i2c quilt tree. You'll get the i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data
prototype update as well as the final version of Grant's DS1682 patch.
You would save yourself quite some work if you were waiting for i2c
patches to come to you through my tree. I am paying attention to the
dependencies, exactly in order to prevent problems like the one above.
Not to say I am not grateful when you collect important i2c fixes which
have been sent only to LKML and that I would otherwise have missed, but
in the case of the DS1682 patch, it was pretty visible that I was taking
care of it.
Thanks,
