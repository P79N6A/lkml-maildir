Right. I threw all of these examples out there and was given the
impression that a one-size fits all "solution" is needed. And to be
honest, I can understand that desire.
I don't want to fall into any "snake oil" traps, because I know the
reality is that there are holes in any solution. The only way
to /really/ be sure of file integrity is to mark every user-visible
pagecache page read only, trap on every single write, and re-scan the
entirety of the file at that point. And even more silliness.
A compromise is therefore called for. I will go shut up and go talk to
these guys and see if I can hook up a public discussion around a set of
requirements. Preferably some code too, but at least a requirements doc.
Thanks,
Jon.
