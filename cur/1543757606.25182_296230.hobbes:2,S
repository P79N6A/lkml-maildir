Didn't wanted to keep this hanging - It turned out to be a strange ndiswrapper 
bug - It seems that the other OS in question allows the following without a 
leak ;) -
ptr =Allocate(...);
ptr = Allocate(...);
:
repeat this zillion times without ever fearing that 'ptr' will leak..
I sent a fix to ndiswrapper-general mailing list on sourceforge if any one is 
using ndiswrapper and having a similar problem.
