Some comments:
1. I think this is a good idea, since serial consoles can also change
timings.  I have seen several race conditions where the problem goes
away once I add a serial console.
2. Should this be a separate debugging option?
3. Shouldn't you have KERN____ in your printk statements?
4. Wouldn't printing out the message every second make the oops scroll
off the screen, defeating the purpose of the patch?
