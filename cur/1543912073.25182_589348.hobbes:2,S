Not another list; just cc: akpm@linux-foundation.org so that he can merge
it into the -mm kernel patches for testing.  Most patches cook in the -mm
kernel(s) before they are merged into mainline.
Then generally the subsystem maintainer(s) are responsible for sending
patches on to Linus for merging into mainline, if/when they are happy
with the patch and they think that it has been tested enough.
Mainline progresses (roughly, e.g.) like so:
2.6.22
then patches are applied and we get (possibly) daily snapshots from git, like
2.6.22-git1, 2.6.22-git2, ...
After the primary 2-week merge window for new code (i.e., not just bug fixes),
we get 2.6.23-rc1.
Then as more patches are merged, we get 2.6.23-rc1-gitN...
Then 2.6.23-rc2 ... 2.6.23-rc2-gitN...
2.6.23-rc3 ... 2.6.23-rc3-gitN...
blah blah blah
You can use git to download and track the mainline kernel changes,
or you can download tarballs + patches (patches for each -rc as well as
for each -gitN snapshot) and apply the patches yourself or use a
script to do it. (like 'ketchup': 
http://www.selenic.com/ketchup/wiki/;
or like 
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/grab_kernel
)
In general, patches should be made against latest/recent kernels, either
current git (cloned or updated via pull), or against recent patches
+ git snapshot if there is a git snapshot that is applicable.
Immediately after 2.6.23-rcN, there is no applicable git snapshot to
be applied (well, a few hours later there may be).
Sometimes it is appropriate to make patches against the -mm kernel
patchset, but only if the patch is for code that is only in that
kernel patchset (or if Andrew asks for a patch to be updated against
-mm).  [This is a mostly rough generalization.]  Andrew normally
takes patches against mainline and coerces them into -mm if coercion
is needed.
