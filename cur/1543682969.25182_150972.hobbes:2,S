Hmm, last time I tested suspend/resume it worked fine.
That was 2.5.67, but the OHCI code hasn't had any
relevant changes since then.
Evidently your system used different suspend/resume paths
than mine did ... :)

Then the problem is that an IRQ is still coming in after the
HCD panicked.

Not ever????
It's freed in exactly one place, after everything should be
shut down.  If it wasn't shut down, that was the problem.
Could you instead figure out why it wasn't shut down?

The OHCI code does that already on the normal panic path
(controller delivers a Unrecoverable Error interrupt), but
you're right that this would be better as a generic KERN_CRIT
diagnostic.  (But one saying which HCD panicked, rather than
leaving folk to guess which of the N it applied to...)  And
I'd print that message sooner, not waiting for that task to
be scheduled.
I'll merge that fix in with one I have in my queue.
