No, it won't do that. I had Red Hat 6.0 as first mirror in Europe, announced
that and the amount of downloaded stuff was ~150GB that night. The machine
was not very busy, so really this cannot stress the machine, at least as
long as the server is located in the Czech Republic.
Also, my pipe to the Internet is just 155Mbps ATM from the switch, so the
test has to be done locally.
Cheers,
