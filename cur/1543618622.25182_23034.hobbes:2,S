That's not his point. ACPI is doing what the BIOS tells us, not asking the 
BIOS to do something for is. That's not a Good Thing, but it's Better. 
Unless you're proactive about scanning BIOS routines for power mgmt,
verifying tables, and analyzing AML before you use it, you won't know 
something is wacky until it bites you. 
With AML, at least you have the freedom to pinpoint the problem and 
overridde it, either by modifying the table yourself, or providing a new 
one(*).
I'm a big ACPI pundit, and disagree with many aspects of the spec and 
implementation. But, a) we're stuck with it and b) it's a lot better in 
many aspects than previous things, including the ability to catch and work 
around problems rather than just punting on them.

(*) Aside from any potential copyright infringement on the tables 
themselves. But, it is theoretically possible to override the DSDT with 
one provided at runtime. So, if someone finds a problem with Company X, 
Model Y's AML, they can go to acpi.sf.net and download a fixed table, run 
a utility to put it in the early init scripts, reboot and be safe. 
Hypothetically.
