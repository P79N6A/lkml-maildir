This is the easiest to asnwer: Kurt Garloff wrote to me, saying that he 
would fix the tmcsim driver, so, I didn't want to duplicate the work. Also, 
I was considering this mostly as a fun-excersice, not really hoping / aiming
at merging it inthe kernel (also given the current freeze). But now, if Kurt
doesn't mind, I can try fixing the other driver, and, hopefully, with your
help, I'll try to do it properly.

Yep, I had my changes encapsulated in #if KERNEL_VERSION... first, but then 
I removed them, but forgot to remove this include.

So that, when it is fixed, somebody can easily switch it on / off:-)

Yes. Again - the fix was pretty much mechanical. I didn't understand why it
was considered SMP-safe to just disable local interrupts, so, just preferred
to go the "minimal modifications" path.

There's a "?" there:-) Which means, I wasn't quite sure, so, is my
assumption correct? I just saw, that other drivers do not implement any 
locking in these functions.

Sure - in irq-handler. But are these lists needed anywhere else, where a
function is called in an "abstract" context without a dev-pointer? Probably,
not.

Found in a "working" driver (which has to be fixed too, then). Will try to 
find a proper fix (for the new driver).
So, thanks a lot for commenting on the patch, and, if nobody minds, I'll try
to fix the tmcsim driver, will try to do it better this time:-)
Thanks
