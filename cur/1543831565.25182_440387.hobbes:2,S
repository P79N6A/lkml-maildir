Well yes and no. $#@$#@* hald will do the open/close stupidity a
couple of times per second. On a 128 CPU system thats quite a lot of
IPI traffic, resulting in measurable noise if you run a benchmark.
Remember that the IPIs are synchronous so you have to wait for them to
hit across the system :(

The idea I wrote the code under was that we are really only concerned to
make sure all bh's related to the device causing the invalidate are hit.
It doesn't matter that there are bh's in the lru from other devices.

Doing it in the callback also means each CPU has to go back and hit the
mask remotely causing a lot of cache line ping pong effects, especially
as they'll be doing it at roughly the same time. This is why I
explicitly did the if (!test_bit) set_bit() optimization.

8 pointers * NR_CPUS - that can be a lot of cachelines you have to pull
in from remote :(

That could be an interesting way out.
