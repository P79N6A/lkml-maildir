Actually, I've been working with a controller for the last several months
(the "latest and greatest", state-of-the-art technology), which can only to
loads/stores in 64-byte units at a minimum.
Yes, I mean "byte".  128-bits wide * 4 DDR beats (2 dobule-edged clocks).
There are no DM pins on the memory interface, so any write less than that
size must be a read-modify-write.
And, I was just having a conversation with a compiler group which was
considering moving to 64-byte alignment as a speed optimization for this
platform, or at least 16-byte (64 bit), which also aligns well with the
native load/store of the CPU involved.
I only wish I was fantasizing about this.
