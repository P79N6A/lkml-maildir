Well, now that you mention it, there's another trace right in front of
the oops. Don't know why I missed it - probably thought it was the same
thing. It says allocation failure. I am running FC2 with 128MB SDRAM.

(Trace in previous message in thread)
I think this is caused by working with a 385 MB LKML archive file when 
low on memory (basically all the time..) I can't ls -l that particular 
folder after t-bird locks up, since ls locks up too and becomes unkillable.
