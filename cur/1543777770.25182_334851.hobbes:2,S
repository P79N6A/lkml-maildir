I don't think it would slow anything down - it would be pretty much
the same code being executed as before e.g. the buffer_start()
callback for overwrite mode could look like this:
int buffer_start()
{
	...	
	return 1; // continue unconditionally
}
And for no-overwrite mode:
int buffer_start()
{
	...	
	return !relay_buf_full(buf); // continue if not full
}
Since the buffer start callback already returns the amount that's
supposed to be reserved at the start of the sub-buffer, I'd have to
make that an outparam instead, I guess, but it's basically the same
code handling the overwrite/no-overwrite condition.
