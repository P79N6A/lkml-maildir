First, let me say, I've gotten both swsusp and suspend2 to work, but
I've had better luck with hardware under suspend2, and reading and
writing the image was faster under suspend2.

So, you mean like merge just the freezer mods (if needed), and the
suspend2 core, and then add the encryption/compression/filewriter/userui
stuff separately?
That doesn't sound too unreasonable, if it's possible to separate them.
