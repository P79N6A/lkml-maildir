We should add the GFP_* allocation flags to that allocation failed
message so we know whether it's atomic, noio, nofs, highmem or what.
Please define 'it dies' a little more precisely - oops, deadlock,
livelock, app terminated or what.  Then please supply the /proc/meminfo
if possible or shift-ScrLk dump to console (roughly the same thing).
He needs to upgrade 2.4.9-preX because that is where the VM work is
being done.  Finally, it would be worth merging this thread with the
following thread on linux-mm:
  0-order allocation problem
