Rene,
this is a known bug in mii-tool, at least in Debian's version.
mii-tool uses old ioctl numbers which were kept in 2.4 (for 
compatibility issues?) but were removed in 2.6.
The solution is to get the source code, patch mii.h to the correct 
values for the SIG... "#define"s (which are found in 
/usr/src/linux/include somewhere, do a grep), and to recompile.
Thomas
