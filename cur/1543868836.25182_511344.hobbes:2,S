Since you are still maintaining 2.6.18, I've just sent another patch for that, 
i.e. the backport of commit 14679eb3c50897889ba62f9a37e3bcd8a205b5e7.
Could you still merge it in this release, especially since this is the last 
2.6.18-stable you are doing?
Also, this patch should also be merged in 2.6.20, but I saw no mail about 
this, so I wanted to make sure it's heading there too.
