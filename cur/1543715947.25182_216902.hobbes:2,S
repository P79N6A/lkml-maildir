Hi Stefan,
Just a quick comment about your patch: it's a common habit of the
sensors folks to prefix i2c bus drivers with i2c-, but not chip
drivers. So I would suggest that you name your driver rtc8564, not
i2c-rtc8564.
Also, please keep the lines in drivers/i2c/chips/Makefile in the
alphabetic order. And your header states
"linux/drivers/system3/rtc8564.c" while the driver will be in a
different location. Please correct.
I've not read your code otherwise, I don't know anything about RTCs.
Thanks.
