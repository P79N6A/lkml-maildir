For example the usage of inode lock changed pretty much and was partly
replaced with the page lock? I can still remember times, where all of the
fs stuff happened under the BKL, for me that means only a _single_ thread
of execution could be busy in the whole fs layer. IMHO that's not really a
prime example of multi-threaded programming, if you have a different
definition please let me now.
> What? You've proposed locking on pageout. If _that_ isn't the fast path...
No, I suggested a lock (not necessarily the inode lock) during allocation
of indirect blocks (and defer truncation of them).

Excuse my stupidity, but could you please outline me how?

Sorry, but did you read my mail? The purpose of that thread is to sleep
and to get waken up to continue the IO. Not very much changes, except that
this thread can safely sleep, whereas kswapd can't.
Excuse my ignorance, but who does currently stop kswapd to start lots of
IO?

Why the hell do you come always with this, I _never_ mentioned it.

I'm very sorry to waste your precious time, but your fscking arrogance
makes me sick. What's your problem? Shall I first worship you as our fs
god who saved us from all races?
Sorry, but from time to time I prefer _first_ to think about a problem and
I try to understand it. One way to do this is to post questions and/or
suggestions to a mailing list (at least I thought so). If you have an 
other suggestion please enlighten me.
bye, Roman
