Evidently the regression was caused by Greg's patch making endpoints into 
real struct devices.  usbdev3.2_ep00 is the device corresponding to 
endpoint 0 on device 2 of USB bus 3.
Is it really true that this patch has been sitting in -mm for several
months (as stated in the cover message to Linus for the new batch of
changes for 2.6.17 sent in yesterday)?
There are several possible ways to fix this.  One is to add suspend and 
resume routines to the endpoint-device driver.  Another is to change the 
code that checks for the children being suspended, to make it check only 
for child USB devices and not child endpoints.
