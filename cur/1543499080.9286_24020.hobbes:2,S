Hey, I was receiving this identical error after patching to 2.3.6.  I
followed the thread on 2.2.10 about requiring patch-2.5 and I now have a
2.3.6 src tree which compiles.  Just reverted the 2.3.6 patch,
downloaded, compiled and installed patch-2.5, reapplied 2.3.6 and
voila.  Maybe now I even know why some earlier patches failed. :)  Good
luck
