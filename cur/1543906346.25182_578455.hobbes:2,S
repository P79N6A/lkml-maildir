No, it is a Pentium M desktop board.:
    Chipset i915GM, FSB 533MHz, max 2GB DDR2 RAM, 2 PCI
    and 1 16x PCI Express slots, serial, parallel, usb, firewire,
    2x Marvel Gigabit Ethernet, Realtek ALC 880 sound, IDE,
    Intel SATA and SiI SATA Raid, FDC, DVI and VGA video out etc.
    Very low power consumption: ~40W to 65W for the whole system,
    except monitor.

Well, it would not be the first time to eliminate a regression by
reverting a
patch after it was accepted previously.

But I _need_ to raise the unreasonably low passive trip point. We could
decide to
protect the innocent user by allowing write access to trip_points only
after a previous

/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/enable_really_dangerous_options
if we believe that this is a good idea ...

Andi, would the above be mechanism sufficiently safe for your taste?
