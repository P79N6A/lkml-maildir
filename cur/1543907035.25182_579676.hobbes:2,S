 Did a few more tests:
 - Cannot reproduce without X running and on display (i.e. Crtl-Alt-F1 and FTP works)
 - Tried another video board (Matrox AGP) and everything works.
 - With the motherboard integrated video (identified by its VESA BIOS name as
 VIA K8M800), it can fail even without doing an FTP - but you need to browse - i.e.
 serial modem connection needs to be active. This video card claims to use shared
 video memory.
 - I tried to find few logs files of X (I do not know much in this area) but since
 I have added the Matrox AGP board, and removed it, X refuses to start. I did not
 have time to inverstigate why.
 Etienne.
