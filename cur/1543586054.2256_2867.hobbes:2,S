It is certainly possible to implement synchronize_kernel() like
primitive for two phase update using "sync point". Waiting for
sys call exit will perhaps work in the module unloading case,
but there could be performance issues if a cpu spends most of
its time in idle task/interrupts. synchronize_kernel() provides
a simple generic way of implementing a two phase update without
serialization for reading.
I am working a "sync point" based version of such an approach
available at 
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/rclock.html.
 It
is based on the original DYNIX/ptx stuff that Paul Mckenney
developed in early 90s. This and synchronize_kernel() are 
very similar in approach and each can be implemented using 
the other.
As for handling preemption, we can perhaps try 2 things -
1. The read side of the critical section is enclosed in
RC_RDPROTECT()/RC_RDUNPROTECT() which are currently nops.
We can disable/enable preemption using these.
2. Avoid counting preemptive context switches. I am not sure
about this one though.

If you are talking about Paul's paper, the link is
