We (the netfilter developers) thought that for the usual case, 8 ports
should be a reasonable compiletime-limit.  I know, especially for IRC,
this largely depends on the number of IRC networks and servers you want
to support...

yes, this is the (documented) way to compile with support for more ports

The suggestion is neither 'good' nor 'bad'.  Nobody has (until now)
asked us to raise this value, eight seems to be enough for most people.
As long as your proposal is not backed by more other users who think the
default should be raised, I'd rather leave it the way it currently is.
btw: further discussion should happen at
