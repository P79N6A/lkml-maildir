Yes, if the only thing you want to run is the kernel.  The applications aren't
going to start so quickly, you know. ;-)

Well, the majority of bugzilla reports I'm tracking are STR-related, so people
_do_ test it, really.

Who they?

If given machine doesn't support the STR or has a broken BIOS (which means
pretty much the same), the suspend-to-disk is the _only_ way in which you can
suspend it.
I guess you're referring to using the suspend-to-disk instead of the STR which
wouldn't be very reasonable indeed, but still I don't know why you consider
it as a problem.

This only works on i386, no?

I don't know of anyone who's doing that.
Yes, we often ask people to try the STD when they report a problem with the
STR to get one more data point, but that doesn't mean we tell them not to try
the STR any more.  Bug reports regarding the STR are accepted and welcome.
