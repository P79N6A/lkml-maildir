It looks like this controller only supports 32-bit DMA addresses. For 
some reason it's trying to feed in an SG list with addresses over 4GB, 
which fails. I'd think this configuration should work, but maybe not?
It looks like you have IOMMU turned off - I think you'll really want to 
turn that on with that much RAM (12GB). Even if this case did work as 
well as it could, without IOMMU the kernel would have to bounce-buffer 
the data below 4GB which will kill performance.
