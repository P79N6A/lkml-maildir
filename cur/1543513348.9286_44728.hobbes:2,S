Define "correctly".
SCSI used to have this problem:  broken devices that responded on all LUNs.
As I understand it, IDE-SCSI has the same problem SCSI used to have:  there 
are a few IDE-SCSI devices which treat LUNs correctly, but the majority 
improperly respond on all LUNs.
Which, to me, suggests a blacklist (or a whitelist, which may well be 
smaller at this point in time) is needed to suppress LUN probing for broken 
devices.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
