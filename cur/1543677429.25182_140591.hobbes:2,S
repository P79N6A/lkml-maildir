Subject: [linux 2.5.71] Unresolved symbol malloc_sizes

I get warnings that __kmalloc and malloc_sizes are undefined in all the 
drivers that I build as modules in 2.5.71.  This is not solely a matter 
of including slab.h either.  The orinoco_cs driver, for example, 
includes slab.h and I still get this error.  Any pointers?
