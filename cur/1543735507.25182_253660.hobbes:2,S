I'm using SuSE 8.2 with the 2.6.8.1 kernel.  I ran xev
on my machine and it didn't detect any tilting at all.
I asked around on some various newsgroups and there
was not a lot of interest in the logitech and
Microsoft mice that have tilt wheels.  This patch was
going to be for myself and all the other small
minority of tilt wheel mouse users.
If you have a better way, that is why I'm asking for
suggestions.  Please give them, or tell me if I've
overlooked something.
