As per the suggestion of the lkml FAQ section 7-7, I have spent some time 
working on a script to automatically go through the Linux source tree and 
generate a stripped down version of the kernel source code (x86 only), along 
with a few additional 'modules' which will contain additional funtionality, 
if desired (such as irda or scsi support).
I have requested an account on kernel.org, and hope to run/test this script 
for each full, stable release.  I would like all of the input possible on the 
script.  Please note that this is the first version, so there are probably 
many rough areas.
For a copy of the script please try:
