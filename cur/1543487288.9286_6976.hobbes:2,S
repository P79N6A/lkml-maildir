NOTE: if something goes wrong and you have my patch applyed, make sure to
bother me and not send bug reports to other kernel hackers. Thanks.

Differences with `Kernelver':
o	FIXED process stuck in D state. It was shrink_dcache_memory()
	that was recalling iput() that was recursing on the lowlevel fs
	super_lock().
o	final semaphore down_interruptible() race fixes. Unlukily 2.2.2
	doesn't include my final fix even if it's really close to be
	perfect
o	new shrink_mmap() that works on a perfect lru basis and doesn't need
	to waste time browsing the mem_map, and mem_map L1 cache aligned in SMP
(o	TCP timestamps ts_recent in tescr of syn-ack) merged in 2.2.2
(o	do_tty_hangup() SMP races) merged in 2.2.2
o	inode cache can't grow over inode-max if you are have not the
	CAP_SYSADMIN capabilities.
(o	inode leakage fix (syncing back dirty inode when there's noting
	of freeable in the inode-inuse list).) merged in 2.2.2
(o	fixed kpiod (PF_MEMALLOC) and improved) merged in 2.2.2
o	complete /proc race fixes
o	improved tqueue.h (better scale in SMP and removed a cli() in
	run_task_queue())
o	My new update_shared_mappings() code. This will greatly improve
	performance while handling shared mmaped files from different contexts.
o	irq_state array is PII cache aligned (32byte to decrease bus traffic
	under intense irq activities in SMP)
o	dynamic buffer hash table size (improvement for high memory
	machines, and saved memory for low memory machines)
o	final fix for the disable/enable_bh I fixed some weeks ago
	This patch fix also a possible not critical race in remove_bh(),
	btw note the wmb() to take care of SMP ;).
o	2.2.1-1284-15 latest parport code mainly developed by Tim Waugh
o	get_wchan() moved in arch specific section and CTRL+SCROLL-LOCK
	use get_wchan() to get the PC filed information.
o	fixed page bound limits in get_wchan()
o	some jiffies wrap update
o	reimplemented hopefully completly wrap compliant time
	to jiffies/msec (and reverse) functions
o	little vmalloc fix + vmalloc SMP thread safety
o	bttv doesn't generate 50 irq per sec even if not used
o	sure some other thing from me and/or from other people
