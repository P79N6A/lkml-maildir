Following are 9 patches for md in 2.6.25-rc2-mm1.  All are fairly
simply bugfixes and are suitable for 2.6.25 (though I confess I
should have sent some of them eariler :-( ).
They include fixes for three bugs found but the scsi fault injection framework
(thanks!), and small raid10 read optimisation, and various other bits
and pieces.
