Dear Justin,
I am really not complaining about you not helping specifically _me_, I am
complaining about your quite visible general opinion that this whole thing is
really not serious, or maybe it is only that you are not making your efforts
transparent to others, I don't know.

VM is quite the same, tar'ing to /dev/tape or /var/bak/mybackfile.tar.

/dev/tape with a filesystem? Have you read what we are talking about?

My question is: is it solved?

This is not the first discussion about an instability in aic. We had the same
thing months ago for another setup (where btw you said the same thing). Back
then I switched to symbios and everything went ok from then on. Thing is: I am
not a big learner, I just re-tried with aic now, and it happened again. I will
do the same thing now like back then: switching to symbios. Be sure I am going
to tell my experiences. Be aware that I have already received reports from
others with the same problem solving it the same way - switching away from aic.

Justin, this is nothing quite serious, I just mentioned it for a feedback to
something _simple_.

What exactly is "elsewhere" if your data is bogus when tar'ing onto /dev/tape
via aic and it is completely ok when tar'ing into a file via reiserfs/3ware ?
There is not really much left between tar and the aic-driver and the tape.
Where is your favourite in this game?

Stephan
