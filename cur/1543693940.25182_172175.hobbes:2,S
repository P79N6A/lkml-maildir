$SUBJECT, AKA the "just returning from vacation release", is at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/bero/2.4/2.4.23/
Not many changes other than syncing with what happened while I was gone:
- Sync with 2.4.23-pre7
- Make sure everything compiles
- Update DRI (good news for SiS graphics users: If you use this
  along with XFree86 CVS, you'll have hw accelerated 3D)
