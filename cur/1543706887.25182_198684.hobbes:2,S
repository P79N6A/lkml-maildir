Bullshit.  It has _nothing_ to characters, wide or not.  For system filenames
are opaque.  The only things that have special meanings are:
	octet 0x2f ('/') splits the pathname into components
	"." as a component has a special meaning
	".." as a component has a special meaning.
That's it.  The rest is never interpreted by the kernel.

Try to realize that different users CAN HAVE DIFFERENT LOCALES.  On the same
system.  And have files on the same fs.  Moreover, homedirs that used to be
on different filesystems can end up one the same fs.  What iocharset would
you use, then?  Sigh...
Again, there is no such thing as iocharset of filesystem - it varies between
users and users can and do share filesystems.  Think of /home; think of /tmp.
It isn't feasible.  At all.  Just as timezone doesn't belong in kernel, locales
have no place there.
