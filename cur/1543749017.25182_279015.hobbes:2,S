It's my BUG_ON(page_mapcount(page) < 0).
We've had about one report per month, over the last six months.
But this is the first citing "gish"; sometimes it's been "cc1".
I've given it a lot of thought, but I'm still mystified.  The last
report turned out to be attributable to bad memory; but this BUG_ON
is too persistent and specific to be put down to that in all cases.
One case that's easy to explain: if it was preceded (perhaps hours
earlier) by a "Bad page state" message and stacktrace, referring to
the same page (in ecx, edx, ebp in your dump), which showed non-zero
mapcount, then this is an after-effect of bad_page resetting mapcount.
And the real problem was probably a double free, which bad_page noted,
but carried on regardless.  Worth checking your logs for, let us know,
but there have been several reports where that's definitely not so.
I presume this was just a one-off?  If you can repeat it from time to
time, I'll try to devise some printk'ing to shed more light.  You might
wonder why I haven't got such a patch already prepared: precisely
because I'm mystified and have no hypothesis worth testing out.
In the meantime, any similar or related traces,
please do send me to scan for commonalities.
Thanks!
Hugh
