Good. One more reason to put it in the 2.5.x as well. :)

Here is how it looks here (SMP machine, it could matter):
major minor #blocks name rio rmerge rsect ruse wio wmerge wsect wuse running use aveq
34 0 40011552 hdg 23 62 189 70 4 3 32 0 -1 946410 -946410
33 0 60051600 hde 8349 18725 214666 108230 3781 15234 152176 91700 -1 927060 -746550

Notice negative numbers for running, aveq. Kernel is 2.4.19-pre5-ac3.

Oops, you're right. I stand corrected. That particular problem doesn't
exist on 2.4.x. It is obviously a property of new bio layer which
exists only in the 2.5.x.
