Does your approach solve the problem of USB devices, like mice, that
don't have device ID's of any sort, where topology is the only way to 
distinguish them?  IIRC, the USB development team was planning to use
topology to provide a limited ability to associate a mouse on a given
port with a display, when XFree86 supports per-Xinerama-display input
device associations.
They new VT console work would benefit from this, too.
