Martin,
I ran into a couple places where CONFIG_X86_NUMA is still there (replaced
now with CONFIG_X86_NUMAQ), which disables following defines:
in asm-i386/apicdef.h:
...
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_NUMA
 #define MAX_IO_APICS 32
...
and in asm-i386/mpspec.h:
...
/*
 * a maximum of 16 APICs with the current APIC ID architecture.
 */
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_NUMA
#define MAX_APICS 256
#else /* !CONFIG_X86_NUMA */
#define MAX_APICS 16
#endif /* CONFIG_X86_NUMA */
...
