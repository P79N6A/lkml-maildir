In my wifes' machine 2.4.1 (both vanilla and -ac2) enabling ACPI causes 
the machine to run so slowly it's unusable.  On my machine it's OK. 
2.4.0 worked fine, so something has changed between 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 that 
broke it.  I couldn't find anything in dmesg that looked any different, 
though.  However since that machine has never successfully booted with 
ACPI on the kern.log hasn't been written so it's unlikely I'd find anything.
