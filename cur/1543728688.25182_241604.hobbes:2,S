Subject: [2.6 patch] CONFIG_MII requires only CONFIG_NET

Hi Jeff,
the patch below still applies against 2.6.8-rc4-mm1.
Could you comment on it and apply it if it's correct?
TIA
Adrian
But trying it out CONFIG_MII=y seems to at least compile with 
CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET=n.
@Jeff:
It seems, CONFIG_MII doesn't actually require CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET?
Could you comment on the following patch?
