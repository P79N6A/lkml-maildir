If getting specific applications to work in a "subsystem" is all you
want, then the bind hack may be sufficient, but it's not enough to
fool all applications. Consider what happens if an application calls
connect without calling bind - what address gets used for the local
address? If an application connects to 127.0.0.1, which subsystem does
it connect to? There are also other problematic scenarios that are
less likely to bite you.
