As long as your disconnect routine doesn't do usb_put_dev, so that it
maintains its reference, I don't see a problem.  But why do you want to
check dev->state later on?  Once your disconnect routine has returned, you
should be totally through with the device.  You should no longer care
whether it's attached or not.
And of course, remember that there are valid reasons for your disconnect 
routine to be called even when the device remains attached.  (rmmod is a 
good example.)
