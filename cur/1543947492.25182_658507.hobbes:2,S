When ext3 was converted from sleeping locks to spinlocks, dbench-on-numaq
throughput went up by a factor of ten.  I'd expect that what RT has done
was a truly awful change for lots of workloads on lots of machines.
Yeah, there's the dont-enable-it-if-you're-doing-that option, but that adds
the we-just-doubled-the-number-of-kernels-distros-need-to-ship problem.
Does -rt also make bit_spin_lock preemptible?  If not, I'd have thought the
change was of little benefit to ext3/jbd and it might as well go back to
spinning locks.
