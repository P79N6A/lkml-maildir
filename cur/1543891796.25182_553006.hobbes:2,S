I determined it cannot happen in my source tree. When notsc
is passed TSC CPUID is cleared and sched-clock works.
I suspect what happens is that lguest forgets to clear the TSC cpuid
bit when it disables TSC. Then the TSC frequency doesn't get computed
and sched-clock can divide by zero.That's purely a lguest bug that needs
to be fixed in lguest with a 
clear_bit(X86_FEATURE_TSC, &boot_cpu_data.x86_capability) 
somewhere
