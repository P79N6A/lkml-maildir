Well, I do not _use_ it, but the RPM I have on k.org and mention
as part of the announcement are built by me by typing "make
rpm".  What I meant to say was that these RPM files may not be
"official" at all from the point of view of distro users, and I
suspect that distro "package maintainers" for git would not be
doing just a plain vanilla "make rpm" using the spec file that
comes as part of git.git repository.
