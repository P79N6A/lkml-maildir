Yeah, right.  So you think a 256MB page-size is optimal for all apps?
What you're missing is how you *get* to the point where you can map N
pages with a single TLB entry.  For that to happen, you need to
allocate physically contiguous and properly aligned memory (at least
given the hw that's common today).  Doing has certain costs, no matter
what your approach is.
