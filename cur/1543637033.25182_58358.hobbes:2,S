I believe you are referring to Device Mapper, which could, in theory,
handle the AIX metadata layout.  However, AFAIK, there are no tools
currently available or under development for Device Mapper to make
this happen.  Currently, EVMS is the only way to read/write to AIX
volumes under Linux.

EVMS can snapshot anything it sees - partitions, LVM volumes, MD devices,
OS/2 volumes, AIX volumes, etc.  LVM2 does do snapshots of LVM2 volumes,
but if it isn't an LVM volume, LVM2 can not snapshot it.  Device Mapper,
however, could snapshot partitions and other non-LVM volumes if only the
tools were available.  As for resizing partitions, EVMS has the code to
manipulate partition tables, including the resizing of partitions.  There
does not appear to be anything in either LVM2 or Device Mapper for
manipulating partition tables and resizing partitions.  User space tools
could be written to work with Device Mapper to make this happen, but such
tools do not yet exist, AFAIK.
