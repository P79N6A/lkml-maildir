Broken in base 2.6.17-rc1 too :-(  VGA comes up and prints a
few messages, and then goes wonky and dies.  Comparing
what I _think_ I saw with the dmesg output, it appears to
die here:
[    6.416740] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:01:00.0[A] -> GSI 18 (level, low) -> IRQ 48
[    6.708439] e1000: 0000:01:00.0: e1000_probe: (PCI:33MHz:32-bit) 00:03:47:fd:bb:42
[    6.754439] e1000: eth0: e1000_probe: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
[    6.761547] netconsole: not configured, aborting
[    6.766195] initcall at 0xa0000001007c4c30: init_netconsole+0x0/0x140(): returned with error code -22
[    6.775520] Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2
    DEAD DEAD DEAD
Should have gone on to say:
[    6.781924] ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
[    6.790052] ICH4: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:1f.1
[    6.795513] PCI: Device 0000:00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
[    6.803100] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.1[A]: no GSI
[    6.808403] ICH4: BIOS configuration fixed.
[    6.812646] ICH4: chipset revision 1
[    6.816271] ICH4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
But I might be off by a line or two, the last bit flashed by quite quickly.
I'll start bisecting tomorrow to see when it was broken.
