Hi,
 I want to setup RAID.
 I am working on kernel version 2.2.12.
 I am using RAID patches available.
 I create a RAID configuring file called 
  /etc/raidtab 
 #mkraid /dev/md0    /*md0 is the device I am   
                      selecting*/
 After this when I check /proc/mdstat , I find that
 /dev/md0 is not running.
 The /proc/mdstat gives message:
 device md0:inactive.
 Where am I wrong?
 should I be doing something else before & after
 mkraid?
 I am not able to post messages to linu-raid group.
 May I know what is the correct mail id for this
 group?
with regards,
  Anil
