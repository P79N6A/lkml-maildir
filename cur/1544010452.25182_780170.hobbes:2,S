Heh.
I have no idea why why you keep bringing up a minor BUG (completely
unrelated to Target_Core_Mod/ConfigFS and LIO-Target v3.0 btw) that was
fixed 10 months ago..?  Perhaps if you spent half the time looking at
actual lio-core-2.6.git code that you do bringing up minor closed bugs
from months ago, you and Vlad would actually understand how ConfigFS
works by now.
