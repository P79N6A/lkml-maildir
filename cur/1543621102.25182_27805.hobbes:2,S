Randomness from network packet timings can be gathered entirely in userspace by
using a packet socket.  I am busy writing an "additional entropy daemon" to
gather entropy from this and other sources[1], clean it up, test its fitness,
estimate its information content, and feed it into the random pool.  This job
is (IMO) better done in userspace because there we can run fitness tests on the
stream more easily because we have floating point etc.
I personally don't think that network packet timings should be added to the
entropy pool by the kernel because they could be controlled to a lesser or
greater extent by an attacker.  I'm hoping that the fitness tests in my
userspace thingy would detect this.
