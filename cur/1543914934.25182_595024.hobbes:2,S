+**** SETUP DATA TYPES
+
+
+**** 32-bit BOOT PROTOCOL
+
+For machine with some new BIOS other than legacy BIOS, such as EFI,
+LinuxBIOS, etc, and kexec, the 16-bit real mode setup code in kernel
+based on legacy BIOS can not be used, so a 32-bit boot protocol need
+to be defined.
+
+In 32-bit boot protocol, the first step in loading a Linux kernel
+should still be to load the real-mode code and then examine the kernel
+header at offset 0x01f1. But, it is not necessary to load all
+real-mode code, just first 4K bytes traditionally known as "zero page"
+is needed.
+
+In addition to read/modify/write kernel header of the zero page as
+that of 16-bit boot protocol, the boot loader should fill the
+following additional fields of the zero page too.
+
+Offset	Type		Description
+------  ----		-----------
+    0	32 bytes	struct screen_info, SCREEN_INFO
+			ATTENTION, overlaps the following !!!
+    2	unsigned short	EXT_MEM_K, extended memory size in Kb (from int 0x15)
+ 0x20	unsigned short	CL_MAGIC, commandline magic number (=0xA33F)
+ 0x22	unsigned short	CL_OFFSET, commandline offset
+			Address of commandline is calculated:
+			  0x90000 + contents of CL_OFFSET
+			(only taken, when CL_MAGIC = 0xA33F)
+ 0x40	20 bytes	struct apm_bios_info, APM_BIOS_INFO
+ 0x60	16 bytes	Intel SpeedStep (IST) BIOS support information
+ 0x80	16 bytes	hd0-disk-parameter from intvector 0x41
+ 0x90	16 bytes	hd1-disk-parameter from intvector 0x46
+
+ 0xa0	16 bytes	System description table truncated to 16 bytes.
+			( struct sys_desc_table_struct )
+ 0xb0 - 0x13f		Free. Add more parameters here if you really need them.
+ 0x140- 0x1be		EDID_INFO Video mode setup
+
+0x1c4	unsigned long	EFI system table pointer
+0x1c8	unsigned long	EFI memory descriptor size
+0x1cc	unsigned long	EFI memory descriptor version
+0x1d0	unsigned long	EFI memory descriptor map pointer
+0x1d4	unsigned long	EFI memory descriptor map size
+0x1e0	unsigned long	ALT_MEM_K, alternative mem check, in Kb
+0x1e4	unsigned long	Scratch field for the kernel setup code
+0x1e8	char		number of entries in E820MAP (below)
+0x1e9	unsigned char	number of entries in EDDBUF (below)
+0x1ea	unsigned char	number of entries in EDD_MBR_SIG_BUFFER (below)
+0x290 - 0x2cf		EDD_MBR_SIG_BUFFER (edd.S)
+0x2d0 - 0xd00		E820MAP
+0xd00 - 0xeff		EDDBUF (edd.S) for disk signature read sector
+0xd00 - 0xeeb		EDDBUF (edd.S) for edd data
+
+After loading and setuping the zero page, the boot loader can load the
+32/64-bit kernel in the same way as that of 16-bit boot protocol.
+
+In 32-bit boot protocol, the kernel is started by jumping to the
+32-bit kernel entry point, which is the start address of loaded
+32/64-bit kernel.
+
+At entry, the CPU must be in 32-bit protected mode with paging
+disabled; the CS and DS must be 4G flat segments; %esi holds the base
+address of the "zero page"; %esp, %ebp, %edi should be zero.
