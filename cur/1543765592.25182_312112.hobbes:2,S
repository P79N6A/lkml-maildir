Is there a way to check what firmware a drive has (either by using some 
software - which would be the best option, or by reading a label on a 
drive)?
If so, we might compile some list to be put in the FAQ?
There was also a post on the list -

suggesting that upgrading Silicon Image BIOS helped resolving these 
problems.
So it might be newer drive firmware, or newer SATA card BIOS (or both) 
that makes my "sil + seagate" combination usable.
