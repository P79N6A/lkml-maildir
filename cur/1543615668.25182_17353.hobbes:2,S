Thomas Graichen told me that lksr.org will be back up 'soon'.  Innominate.org 
is back up, run by Gerrit Pape, one of a group of Berliners who call 
themselves 'exnominate' (that would include me).  In fact, innominate itself 
is back, but that's a whole nuther story.
p.s., if Andries is right - and he probably is - then it looks like Linus's 
habitual style is 'space after cast' and 'space after sizeof'.  We could 
always ask.
If we put enough work into lindent, maybe we'll come up with a Linusbot?
