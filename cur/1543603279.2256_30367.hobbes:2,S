Hi,
Perhaps I don't understand how linmodems work to understand well
enough how FUSD would apply - do you talk to linmodems through the
serial driver?  If so, sounds like a good application - but we might
still have the same problem with binary-only drivers as the
user-to-kernel message format used by FUSD may change over time.
(Indeed, it's already changing relative to v1.0 in response to
some of the mail I've gotten in the past few days.)
Best,
Jer
