Sorry you're feeling picked on and under appreciated.
It really doesn't matter to me by whom or how this came to be.  More
than once in my career, I have cleaned up some stuff, then out of
curiosity gone back to see who might have written such crap -- only to
discover it was I.  I've learned to not ask such questions.  Just keep
on trying to make things better.
We are working on a large and ever changing body of code with thousands
of others active at any point.  The opportunities for refinement and
improvement are endless.  Don't sweat how we got here; those who have
done the most (such as yourself) probably have created the most
"opportunities" for further refinment.  Just judge each change on its
current merits, and on whether it moves in the right long term
directions.
