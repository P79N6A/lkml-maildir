  Okay, thanks, that clarifies it, and if I read it right this may be a
permanent restriction. If the system is running noapic so the ints all go
to CPU0 does that help the situation? In a sane system I agree with Alan
that this is not a performance hit, or at least not significant.

Guys, I wasn't questioning anyone's competence, just agreeing with the
original poster that if this is going to be an ongoing issue of stability
it might be held back for a version until there is time to either program
around it or characterize the conditions under which it causes problems. 
And if that means that I can't trust it SMP, I don't think I'm a bad guy
to suggest the config drop the driver if SMP support is selected.
I don't mind moving a card to another system, and even if I didn't have
another system I would rather not take that particular risk. And if it
won't work reliably SMP then perhaps Promise should be taking some action.
There are SMP W2k machines out there, too.
