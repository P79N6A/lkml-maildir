How about
static inline void insert_inode_hash(struct inode *inode)
{
	__insert_inode_hash(inode, inode->i_hash);
}
in fs.h and switching those who want something different to direct use
of __insert_inode_hash()?
It's going to remain a very common case and IMO it makes a lot of sense
to keep a simple helper for it.  That has a nice property of getting
patch way smaller ;-)
