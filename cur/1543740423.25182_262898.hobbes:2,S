I have to say that it's a really good idea... For my point of view, I 
think that stability is the best point to get. But getting a such type 
of graphic board with the open source community will be stable enough in 
a small amount of time...
As I said, I agree completely with the subject and I think that trying 
to get a small team to begin development is the first step to go though...
