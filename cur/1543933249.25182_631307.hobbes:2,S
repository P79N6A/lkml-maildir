I would say that there's that really ugly thing with embedding kobject
into a struct with the lifetime rules of its own and then having that
struct kfree()d while kobject might still have references, but hey,
maybe it's just me and my lack of appreciation of the glory that is
sysfs.
	Al, too tired of ranting about sysfs being a major architecture
mistake and a recurring source of turds like that one...
