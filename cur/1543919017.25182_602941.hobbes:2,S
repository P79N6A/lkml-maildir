Well, you can still include those test-method details in the body of the
message in addition to adding the "Tested-by:".
Does "Tested-by" just mean they ran some relevant test on the final
version of the patch?  The really hard part is often the initial work
required to find a good reproduceable test case, capture the right error
report, or bisect to the right commit.  I think that also counts as
"testing".  And it'd be nice to have a tag for those sorts of
contributions, partly just as another way to ackowledge them.
