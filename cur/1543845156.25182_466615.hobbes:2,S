Subject: [PATCH 2.6.18] IA64: Add pci_fixup_video into IA64 kernel for    embedded VGA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/26/71

To be compatible with Xorg's handling of PCI, we need pci_fixup_video on IA64
platform like x86 platform. There are also machines, which have VGA embedded
into main board, among IA64 platform. Embedded VGA generally don't have PCI ROM,
and there are VGA ROM image in System BIOS. Therefore, these machines need
pci_fixup_video for the sysfs rom. pci_fixup_video already exists in x86 Linux
kernel. However since this function doesn't exist in IA64 kernel, we could not
run X server on IA64 box has embedded-VGA.
I tested pci_fixup_video on IA64 box has embedded-VGA. I confirmed we can read
VGA BIOS from the sysfs rom regardless of embedded-VGA.
