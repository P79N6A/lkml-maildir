Do we need the CPU has booted message?  If it fails to boot, we get
notified.  Can we leave it at that?
As far as I can tell, the nasid and slice is fairly useless.  It might
be helpful, but there should be more user accessible ways of determining
the topology than using boot messages.
The BogoMIPS is another which I would think could be eliminated unless
it is significantly different from the boot cpu.  Maybe say greater
than 10% different.
With these, the boot has been reduced to one migration thread message
when a cpu starts and I believe two lines when one fails to start.
