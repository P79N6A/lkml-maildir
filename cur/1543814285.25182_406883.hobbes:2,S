Actually now that I think back there are machines with < 4GiB of ram
with 64bit pci BAR values.  It is more common to have 32bit values BAR
values and > 4GiB of ram.
So I don't see dma_addr_t in general being the right choice.
Although I do suspect that in most cases dma_addr_t <= the
size of what is in struct resource.
Nor do I think struct resource is nearly as important when being
efficient, as dma_addr_t.  struct resource is only used during
driver setup which is a very rare event.  A few extra instructions
there likely will get lost in the noise and most of the will probably
be removed because they are in an __init section anyway.
