After trying both, I can state with certainty that using
pthread_cond_broadcast() vs. pthread_cond_signal() results in VERY
different levels of context switching and associated performance
degredation.  Of course, this still doesn't prove that there isn't
extra overhead with the waking of just one thread.
As I said to someone in private email on the subject, the overhead of
a thread context switch might indeed be less than that of a process,
but its still quite significant in some applications.
