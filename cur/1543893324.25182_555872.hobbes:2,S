There are entire architectures that have been merged and maintained by
folks who speak little to no english, for example. I'll let you figure
out which ones. Many drivers and such, too. Perhaps you've simply never
noticed since these folks tend not to be terribly vocal.
This is not to say that there aren't communication barriers, but things
do gradually get done in any case.

Documentation/* is in enough disarray as it is, I think it's worth having
more people looking at it and verifying that things are up to date and
accurate, regardless of what language they happen to be working in.
Kconfig localization (is is that time of year already?) is another
problem entirely, and one that doesn't have a lot of chance of being kept
up to date. Documentation/* on the other hand isn't terribly prone to
heavy modification, I'd wager most people would rather be lining up to
voluntarily rewrite the floppy driver than even accidentally cd in to
Documentation/. In any event, the rate of change is far lower, and people
at least have a chance of keeping translations updated.
Documentation is one area where we simply suck, the more people working
on it, the better.
