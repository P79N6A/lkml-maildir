you might have done some research on what happened before ranting away
like a crazy.....
AGP dropped the drm_agp interface in favour of the DRM modules calling
the AGP backend directly, a patch for the ATI drivers has been sailing
around for ages I even wrote one myself for someone I think but I've
lost it now ... all the AGP symbols needed are exported with
EXPORT_SYMBOL.
you might have noticed no-one else complaining around here which is
usually a good sign that there is nothing worth complaining about :-)
Dave.
