Because they don't spend their lives tracking the base kernel, they
expect sanity to prevail and their idea of an obsolescence cycle is
about five years.
ISV = "Independant software vendor"
Obsoleting stuff which is distribution internal configuration type stuff
(eg devfs->udev) is one thing but core syscall related stuff has to
undergo a much much longer cycle, or in many cases you just have to look
at it and treat it as a lesson for the future and a thing to tackle in
whatever OS obsoletes Linux.
Thats why 0.98.5 libc 2.2 and rogue still work on 2.6.
