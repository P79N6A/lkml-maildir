The above example affected all subsequently created files and subsequently
created directories under user steven, such as DKA300:[USERS.STEVEN.TESTTHIS].
Previously created directories retain their previous version_limit setting, which
I checked in DKA300:[USERS.STEVEN.HELLOWORLD].  Previously created files also
retain their previous version_limit setting.
I also set the version_limit for the whole disk (as SYSTEM) with 
SET DIRECTORY/VERSION_LIMIT=1 DKA300:[000000], but again this only affected
subsequently created files and directories along with the files they contain.
I have not figured out how to set the version_limit retroactively; perhaps it is
not possible with a simple command.  Obviously, you could do this with a DCL 
script if you really wanted to.
