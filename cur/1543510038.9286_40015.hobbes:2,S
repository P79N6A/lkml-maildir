For NTFS, I'd always envisaged pluggable kernel modules to do the translation,
which would allow a number of solutions, across a range of complexity. The fs
would certainly want to cache the mappings, and the modules would probably
want some way to invalidate bits of the cache. This would allow a really
simple solution for someone who just wants to access his NT volumes on his
home PC - a module that read a list of mappings from a file and kept them
in memory, or maybe the list could be populated by writing to a device or
files in /proc.  Really complicated solutions could talk to a userspace
daemon (with precautions taken to avoid deadlocks), or implement some sort
of network protocol.
