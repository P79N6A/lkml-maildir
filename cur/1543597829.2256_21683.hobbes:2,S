Hello,
In short, I may have done a bad thing, this I know but .....
I noticed that when I tried to backup a box across the LAN via dump to a
localy mounted drive ...
<mental picture>
Box1 has:
hda and hdb, hdb has a fat32 fs (don't ask)
Box2 has 
/mnt/backup, mounted to box2:/mnt/hdb1.  
</mental picture>
.. dump crashed with:
  DUMP: 78.80% done at 814 kB/s, finished in 0:10
  DUMP: error reading command pipe in master: No such file or directory
  DUMP: The ENTIRE dump is aborted.
Trying to check where dump should have written the file on box2, I get:
# ls -al
/bin/ls: test: Value too large for defined data type
total 2097216
drwxrwxrwx   2 root     root        32768 Aug 14 23:27 ./
drwxrwxrwx  50 root     root        32768 Aug 14 21:02 ../
-rwxrwxrwx   1 root     root     2147483647 Aug 14 22:11
box1.071401.dump*
#
Ok so I lied, that is a paste from after my little expriment, but you can
see the file size.  2.1G, out of a 3G drive.
What caused the error and my emailing the list, is I created a file using
dd (dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=4098k count=1000), but I cannot access that
file at all.  The only thing that seems to not care about it is "echo" :
# echo *
box1.071401.dump test
#
I tried to remove the file using rm, but I get the same error as ls:
# rm test
rm: cannot remove `test': Value too large for defined data type
# 
The file is taking up ~4G of space (which is reflected correctly with df,
du will not read the file).  
It was a stupid thing to do, but could there be a better way for the OS to
handle this and is there any way I can remove the file?  It's on  a 60
Gig drive, so formatting would not be an option right about now ...
The box in question (box2), is running Slack with a 2.4.3 kernel:
# uname -a
Linux box2 2.4.3 #7 SMP Sun Apr 29 13:42:05 EDT 2001 i686 unknown
#
Any thoughts?
