The MEMS accelerometer measures the projection of the
acceleration/gravity vector in two orthogonal directions.
If you place the notebook on a horizontal table, the projection of
gravity to both the directions measured will be zero, because the
gravity vector is orthogonal to both of the directions.
Thus for each direction you get the value at -1, 0, and +1 G, and that's
perfectly enough to get a calibration, as long as the accelerometer is
linear, which MEMSes to a reasonable degree are.

Well, accelerometers are not load cells with a weight mounted to them,
that's the thing.

The Earth's gravity is a very well known real value.
