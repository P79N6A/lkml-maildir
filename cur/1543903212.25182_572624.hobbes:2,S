Some versions of this hardware support MSI-X and not MSI.  If it can't
get all the MSI-X interrupts, it will try a single interrupt before
fallign all the way down to Legacy interrupts.  Basically, if we can
only get one interrupt, we'd still like to use the MSI-X mechanics if
possible.  If totally out of the question, then we'll use legacy.
