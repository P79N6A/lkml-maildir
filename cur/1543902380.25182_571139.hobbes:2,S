Some comments on that list :
} PCMCIA IOCTL support
}
} Currently listed in the removal file as scheduled for deletion back
in November of 2005, but
} there's some debate as to whether it's really ready to go.
If you remove that don't you run the risk of breaking existing
userspace (something which we don't do lightly) ?  Same goes for other
IOCTL's on the list as well as the ulog support.
Also, some items seem to have made the list since they depend on
BROKEN_ON_SMP or have no active maintainer.  As for depending on
BROKEN_ON_SMP, as long as the drivers work fine on UP they may have
users, so removing them would constitute regressions for those users -
especially if there's no replacement driver. Wouldn't it be better to
try and get those BROKEN_ON_SMP drivers to become SMP safe instead of
just removing them (or just leave them as-is if they work for some
people on UP)?
As for the lack of an active maintainer being a partial reason for
removal. I don't agree with that. As long as the code works and gets
fixed up to continue working when other parts of the kernel evolve,
then I see no reason to remove the code just because noone is actively
maintaining it. Sometimes unmaintained code even grow new maintainers
after a while.
