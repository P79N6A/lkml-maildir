Subject: [patch] 2.4 raid shutdown issue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

kernel 2.4.19
I've found a minor problem with software RAID during linux shutdown.
If the raid device contains a filesystem, and the filesystem wasn't dismounted 
at shutdown time, the RAID device will not shutdown properly, and at next 
reboot it'll need a resync.
This happens when:
- I have the root filesystem on a RAID1 device
- The RAID isn't compiled as module
- The RAID partition id is 0xfd (linux raid autodetect)
So I wrote this kernel patch forcing read-only mode for every RAID device, 
before shutdown.
This is my first kernel patch, so, maybe, there could be a cleaner way to 
resolve this issue; please, let me know your opinion on it.
