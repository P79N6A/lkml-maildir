I am seeing something similar here with both U5 and U6 on both of my SMP 
systems (actually I haven't gotten to try U6 on my SMP system at home 
yet.) On my SMP system here (dual Xeon) I get a handful of traces during 
the boot and then the last thing I see is a trace that has something to 
do with parport, but the key MIGHT be that it always seems to crap out 
when I get traces for 3-level deep critical section nesting. I will try 
to capture the trace the old-fashioned way when I get a chance shortly.
I do have U5 booted on my UP system at home though.
