Quite O.K. for me.

Probably I have not explained it correctly:
- The "information page" (that includes the current CPU no.) is not a
  per CPU page
- This page is just another page that is mapped at a "well known" user
  virtual address (for those who are interested in)
- As you do not do any special action for each user page on context
  switch, there is nothing to to this page either
- The scheduler sometimes migrates a task, then it updates the
  the current CPU number on the "information page"

It depends on what else can be in this "information page".
As for the current CPU no., you need a single store on each task migration.
Thanks,
