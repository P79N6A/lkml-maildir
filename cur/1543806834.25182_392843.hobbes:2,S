I am aware of the difference between GPL and BSD. My point was that if
Linus feels that we should not enforce our rules on others then why does
he prefer a license that does just that? If people will come around just
by seeing how well the community works then BSD should be sufficient, or
even public domain.
I don't share this view, which is why I like the DRM ideas in GPLv3
which close something I see as a loophole in GPLv2.
