Actually, it might be better to teach mempool_alloc to not call page reclaim
at all if __GFP_FS is not set.  Just kick bdflush and go to sleep.
I really, really, really dislike the VM's tendency to go and scan hundreds
of thousands of pages.  It's a clear sign of an inappropriate algorithm.
Test something like this, please?
