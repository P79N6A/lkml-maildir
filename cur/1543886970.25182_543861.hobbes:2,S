Ouch no. The PIT has no continuous counter, especially not when we use
the PIT to generate the next event interrupt with variable length
intervals. 
The PIT can only be used as a clock source, when it is in periodic mode,
but it is never continuous. If we miss one PIT interrupt the time
keeping is hosed.
