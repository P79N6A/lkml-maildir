Here's at least one example:
drivers/ieee1394/video1394.c:__video1394_ioctl()
I'm having trouble finding more (maybe I already fixed some of them via
the existing macros in different ways -- or maybe my memory is just
acting up...).
I think this patch/macro can be useful for wait-queues where the same
lock is used to protect the sleeper and the sleeper's data?
Any further feedback would be appreciated, or any recommendations for
better ways of doing things. I really would just like to have one
consistent interface for all wait-queue usage :) The fact that was is
nearly (but not quite) done by wait_event*() has to be defined somewhere
else just to get that functionality, when it costs little to add it to a
common header, makes this a pretty small change to me.
But, Arnd, I understand your concern. It would not be good if we had a
bunch of lock-holding sleepers pop up now! I will try to think of a
better solution.
Thanks,
Nish
