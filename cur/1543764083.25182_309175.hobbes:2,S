I think you haven't read what I wrote. The part that makes up the
chicken-and-egg problem is the part where there is no infrastructure to
USE such firmware in initrds, to distribute it with the kernel image
etc.

and for the distro people who need to get their distro to do this sort
of thing very smoothly. It also, to put it bluntly, shuts the "fanatics"
up because they have their solution immediately, while others that may
need more time to get their distro ready, have such more time. I don't
have the illusion that any distro will do the infrastructure work if
there are no drivers that are going to use it. Nor do I have the
illusion that driver writers will make a hard switch until such
infrastructure is out there en masse.
Note that I don't even mention anything about not shipping the firmware
in the kernel tarbal. It might be an option in the end, depending on how
the infrastructure developers; but that is not part of the stalemate
that I see. You seem to be focused on only that thing, but to be honest,
for me that is the least interesting/controversial part.
