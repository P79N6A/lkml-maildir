one thing I am concerned is the those 'rm' replacements does not cover all
the cases. For example, you can call 'unlink' directly from c/perl
program, which will not go through 'rm'.  If you really want undelete
freature, I think it should be done a little higher level than, replacing
'rm'.  hrmm that makes me wonder.. when you overwrite a file, does the
kernel 'unlink' the file first and assign a new inode?
