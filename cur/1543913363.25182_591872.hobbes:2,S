You shouldn't push this even for 2.6.24 ... I can't see why/how a runtime
BUG() scores over erroring out at build-time itself. And if there is no
codepath that leads to that BUG() at runtime, then what's the point of
adding dead code ...
So I wonder if what you're actually looking for is some kind of Kconfig
dependencies that will *prevent* the kind of .config from being generated
that Ingo ran into ?
