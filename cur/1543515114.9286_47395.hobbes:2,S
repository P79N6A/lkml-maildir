Subject: i386 kernel_thread() questions

If I understand the i386 kernel_thread() function, it does this (in
pseudo-code):
int kernel_thread(int (*fn)(void *), void * arg, unsigned long flags)
{
  eax = __NR_clone;
  ebx = flags | CLONE_VM;
  somereg1 = arg;
  somereg2 = fn;
  esi = esp;
  int $0x80;
  if (esp != esi)
    {
      eax = somereg1;
      somereg2 (somereg1);
      eax = __NR_exit;
      int $0x80;
    }
  return eax;
}
Questions:
1. Why isn't ecx set to a stack pointer before the clone system call?
2. Why isn't ebx set to a status code before the exit system call?
