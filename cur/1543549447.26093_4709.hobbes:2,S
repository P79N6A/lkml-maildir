This one chokes after about 10 mins. Total meltdown. Drives are brandnew,
so I doubt the failure.
If I md5sum the files after eachother instead both at the same time, no
errors. In case of a real disk failure, it should also bark in this case.
The only difference is the load : about 1.0 in case 1 (no crash), > 2.0 in
case 2 (total meltdown)
