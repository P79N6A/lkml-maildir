Your current patches have two problems:
 - they are simply unnecessarily invasive for a relatively simple issue
 - all versions I've looked at closer are buggy too
Example:
	+               if (pte_dirty(*pte) && pte_write(*pte))
	+                       *pte = pte_wrprotect(*pte);
Uhhuh. Looks simple enough. Except it does a non-atomic pte access while 
other CPU's may be accessing it and updating it from their hw page table 
walkers. What will happen? Who knows? I can see lost access bits at a 
minimum.
IOW, this isn't simple code. It's code that it is simple to screw up. In 
this case, you really need to use ptep_set_wrprotect(), for example.
So why not do it in many fewer lines with that simpler vma->dirty flag?
