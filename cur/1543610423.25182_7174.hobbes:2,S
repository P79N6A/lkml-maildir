I have fat32 partition, but the problem isn´t the size of partition it is
8GB. The problem is that if you want to
create a cpio backup of a linux system 3.5GB (I did that to reformat a ext2
to a reiserfs) to an available fat32 space, in my case the backup size is
allways 2GB and when I tried to extract back I saw "unexpected end of file".
So I thought it was that famous kernel limitation of 2GB under any kind of
partition, but i was informed that fat has this limitation too. So the
kernel may suport files bigger than 2GB (I really don´t know, I just know
that in my case with fat32 it did not and I saw this too with some oracle
databases that could not be used when they grow and reach 2GB, may be a
library problem too).
That´s all.
