Could be. I didnt write that code. I think Manfred also played with the
copy tricks that came from the AMD slides.

K6-II/III does. I don't know about original K6. but I believe it
doesn't. The original 3Dnow was a joint Cyrix/AMD thing and it lacks 
several instructions later added (including prefetch). The later Cyrix
also has a couple of the additional ones but not prefetch.

Well there is a suprise, AMD didn't design it 8)

What else checks the 3Dnow bit ?

I'll have to go check again. Its something RH internal testing found

Has AMD confirmed that your solution is ok for the K7 as well as K8 - ie
that if we hit the errata the fixup recovers the CPU from whatever
lunatic state it is now in  ?
