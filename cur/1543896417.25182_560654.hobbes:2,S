Yes, quite correct in most cases. But if you have taken control of a computer
on of the more common ways to keep the control for some time is the
installation of a suid-binary (e.g. as part of a rootkit). 
One could also imagine a scenario where an attacker controls some filesystems
(on external storage perhaps) where he can of course manipulate the suid bit,
but he does not have direct control over the attacked system unless he can
execute that file.
