I think it became a lot more likely recently, perhaps removing that
unlikely is not such a bad idea.

because the rest of the code is wrong, there are only 2 other sites, and
I have a patch that removes those div64_64() with =0;
The idea is to use rounding division: (x + y/2) / y
but we can't because 'x' is touching the limits of our modulo space,
hence we do: (x - y/2) / y
which comes in 1 short, that fixup has been lost along the way.

Is a full memory miss not more expensive on most modern machines?
And, no sadly I have no ideas on how to get rid of it ;-/
