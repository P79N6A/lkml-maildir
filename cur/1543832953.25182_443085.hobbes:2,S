I would suggest testing swsusp before each suspend2 release. It's not
difficult at all to maintain a system that can suspend to disk using
either method, especially if you use something like Bernard's hibernate
scripts.
I would say that's especially important if you're posting the patches
for inclusion in mainline. It's simply not acceptible to merge patches
that break working in-kernel setups.

Unfortunately, no. Because of the intermittency of the crashes, I was
usually on the road or in the middle of something else when a crash
happened, so I never captured any of the backtraces.
