I have a Dual Pentuim II 233 system with 128 MB Ram and DPT SmartCache IV set 
up with  4 2GB drives set up in a 4GB raid 5 array with hotspare.
I just installed Redhat 5.2 with all upgrades, and kernel 2.2 RPMS.
I compiled 2.2.4 with SMP enabled and all of the relevant stuff required (pre 
2.2  and 2.2.[1-2] ran great on this box)
When it boots, it now comes up with the following after initialising the SCSI 
card & recognising the drives available to it.
sdb: sdb1 <sdb5>
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000008
current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0000

Process insmod (pid: 6, process nr: 7, stackpage=c7e59000)
etc etc etc
any ideas?
