Why on earth would you want to sign the whole thing? As you've observed,
that means the signature gets broken when the debug info is stripped,
etc. Sign just what the kernel actually _looks_ at, nothing more.
Signing the whole thing is just silly. If you're going to include random
extra irrelevant stuff like comment sections and debug info, then you
might as well include the inode number and device on which the .ko file
is stored too -- so it breaks when you 'cp' it.

That doesn't mean you have to pander to him.
