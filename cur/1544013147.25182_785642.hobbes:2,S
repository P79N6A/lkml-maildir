OK, it hits a lot of files in minor ways.
You could ask Linus to merge it late in the -rc1 merge window (please
cc me on the email).  Or you could just send it to me (with the usual
cc's) and I'll toss it into my 2.6.29-rc1 pile.  I doubt if it'll cause
much trouble.  But please do check its applicability to linux-next - people
have been moving arch files into different directories lately.
