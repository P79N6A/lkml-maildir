Incorrect, it makes code smaller and more readable at the cost of extra
function call and an if.
A more useful thing would be if you went through entire source code and
converted all kmalloc/memset combinations to use kzalloc() and compiled
the kernel and compared the size to the previous one and posted the result
to me and the list. Also, then run your favourite benchmarks and see
if the extra function call and 'if' introduced anything to worry about.

Tigran.
