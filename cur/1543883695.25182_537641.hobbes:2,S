Subject: [PATCH 02/12] i386 head.S: Remove unnecessary use of %ebx as the boot cpu flag
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently in head.S there are two ways we test to see if we
are the boot cpu.  By looking at %ebx and by looking at the
static variable ready.  When changing things around I have
found that it gets tricky to preserve %ebx.  So this
patch just switches head.S over to the more reliable
test of always using ready.
Hopefully later we can kill these tests entirely.
