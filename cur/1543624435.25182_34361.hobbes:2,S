Since when has carbon fiber got anything to do with Pianos and other
musical instruments that need to be "tuned" ?
tune vt.:
4. to adjust (an electronic circuit, a motor, etc.) to the proper or
   desired performance.
tune up:
2. to put (an engine) into good working order.
I therefore think "tune" (to tune the interface) is a reasonable name for
the function that is being performed.
