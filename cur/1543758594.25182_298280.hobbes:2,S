FWIW, I've got a working prototype that is ppc64-architecture specific
and I've been yelled at for not proposing an architecture-generic API
and so my current goal is to hash out enough commonality with Seto to 
come up with a generic API that's acceptable for the mainline kernel.
(FYI, the 'prototype' currently ships with Novell/SUSE SLES9, but 
I haven't been sucessful in getting the patches in upstream.)

Most hotplug-capable drivers are "most of the way there", since they
can deal with the sudden loss of i/o to the pci card, and know how
to clean themselves up.

Yes; for example, the pci error might affect multiple device drivers.
The proposal is that there should be a "master cleanup thread" to
deal with this (see my other email).
> Shutting down the hardware by default might be a horribly bad thing to do
The current ppc64 prototype code does a pci-hotplug-remove/hotplug-add
if we've detected a pci error, and the affected device driver doesn't 
know what to do.  This works for ethernet cards, but can't work for
anything with a file system on it (because a pci-hotplug-remove 
on a scsi card trickles up to the block device, which trickles up to
the file system, which can't be unmounted post-facto.)

On ppc64, "just continue" is not an option; the pci slot is "isolated"
all i/o is blocked, including dma. 
The current prototype code tells the device driver that the pci slot is
hung, then it resets the slot, then it tells the device driver that the
pci slot is good-to-go again.  
My goal is to negotiate a standard set of interfaces in struct pci_driver 
to do the above. (see other email).
