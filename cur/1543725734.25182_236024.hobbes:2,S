Excuse me, but just exactly what is considered to be "3d"?  The screen 
I'm looking at is a 17" nearly flat crt, and damned sharp considering 
this NEC 5FG is now at least 10 years old, and I've never seen 
anything on it that could be construed to be "3d", not even in my 
wildest, had too many beers or Black Jacks dreams.
Methinks its an overused advertizing phrase that should be tossed in 
the bin (and miss-use of it prosecuted as false advertizing) until 
such time as it can actually, without any special glasses, display an 
image with true depth.
