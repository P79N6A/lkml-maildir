I'm thinking of get_page_state_node... but that's not quite the same
thing. I guess sum all per-CPU counters from all zones in the node,
but that's going to be costly on big machines.
So I'm not sure, I guess I don't have any bright ideas... there is the
batching approach used by current pagecache_acct - is something like
that not sufficient either?
