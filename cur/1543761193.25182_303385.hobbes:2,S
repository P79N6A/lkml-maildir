seems like turning the bitlocks into spinlocks is the best option then. 
We'd need one lock in buffer_head (j_state_lock, renamed to something
more sensible like b_private_lock), and one lock in journal_head
(j_list_lock) i guess. How much would the +4/+8 bytes size increase in
buffer_head [on SMP] be frowned upon?
