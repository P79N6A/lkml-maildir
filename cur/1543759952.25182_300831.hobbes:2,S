ARM is out of line, again?

Oh, I misunderstood you, sorree ;)

I've heard of that, I got the impression we're discouraged from
mailing it.  This is probably too minor to engage their attention.
Currently there is no arch using page_mapping in its header files,
presumably they were all forced out of line at that time.  I think
it's wrong to bump people into rearranging their code to get around
a missing export, but if you're happy with the status quo, so be it.
I expect Christoph and I would agree that what's really wrong is
for page_mapping to be referring to that strange implementation
detail swapper_space at all.  I'd say the export should remain so
long as the reference remains, to avoid post-release surprises
like last time; but I've had my say, que sera sera.
