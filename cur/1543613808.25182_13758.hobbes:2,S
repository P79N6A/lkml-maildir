I'm afraid I can't. It just happened. I only can describe what was I doing,
although it must be useless....
The system booted with linux 2.4.17-rc1. I was readin mail in kde
 when  I tried to mount my vfat partition on /win to listen mp3. (as a
normal
 user, of course). But  I couldn't mount it. Reason?:
 	ls: mtab: permission denied
 Then I log as root, but ls -l /etc/mtab said:
 	ls: mtab: permission denied
 any chmod in /etc/mtab: (as root)
 	chmod: getting attributes of mtab: Permission denied
 After this, the filesystem started to fail a lot in all other programs
 , the problem is in some files in /etc.
