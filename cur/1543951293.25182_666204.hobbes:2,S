I disagree with your claim of "too unreliable".  If the UPS power does
not fail before flushing completes, it is perfectly reliable.  Perhaps
you need a belt to go with your suspenders?
As I wrote earlier, you cannot have optimal writeback speed and ordering
at the same time.  I can see eventually implementing some kind of ordered
writeback mode where completion is signalled to the application before
writeback completes.  You then get to choose between fastest flush and
most paranoid ordering.  I guess everybody will choose fastest flush,
but I will be happy to accept your patch to see which they actually
choose.

If you think this is like replication then you have the wrong idea
about what is going on.  This is a cache consistency algorithm, not
a replication algorithm.
