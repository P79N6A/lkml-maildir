Yes, good idea.  Of course, you shouldn't need to parse them, you just
need to create them, but clearer is better (I'd use , not : though).

Sorry.  I'll try to be less efficient in the future.

It sucks to reproduce this, yes.  But you need to know the size of the
structure to grab it out of the object file.  At least this way it's
in the kernel source where we can change it.

	The plan was that /sbin/hotplug will gather all the fields for
whatever device has been inserted and create the modprobe string, eg:
		system("modprobe usb:v0506p4601dl01dh01dc01dsc01dp01ic01isc01ip01");
	Which will simply match the alias such as:
		usb:v0506p4601dl*dh*dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*

	Hmm, I thought about enhancing this code to generate the .map
files as well (where it has all the information).  BTW, did I break
the current depmod map-generating code?

Thanks,
