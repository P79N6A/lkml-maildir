I'm all for openness of device programming specs, but I think it's a
bit disingenous to suggest that all a company has to do to get a
driver written and supported is throw some documentation over the
wall.  And it's crazy to suggest that the driver will work on every
platform and be supported by enterprise distros.
Just look at the in-tree drivers: there are tons of them that don't
work on big-endian platforms, or have 64-bit problems, or have no SMP
support.  And that doesn't even count drivers that are so bitrotted
they won't even build any more.  And there are plenty of documented
devices that no one cares enough about to submit a driver for.
In the real world, a vendor that wants to make sure a device is
supported by Linux had better pay someone to write the driver and keep
it working.  Of course, if the device is popular enough or simple
enough, docs are all that's needed, but in many cases no one competent
to write the driver is going to volunteer to do it.
