Don't expect much cheer and rejoicing over this.  I suspect that akpm
or Linus will either want the 17 patches merged into one or have a
patchset where every single patch leaves the kernel in a working
state, including working eHCA driver.
Generally, there seemed to be a bit more SHOUTING when compared to
other kernel code.  Might be something to look at as well.
