That sounds reasonable. Sorry for the delay, but I didn't receive your
mail earlier (not being on the cc:).
I have added this notice to all core files of the distribution and
released it as 1.3, assuming that this solves all the problems. It can
temporarily be found here: 
http://data.plan9.de/liblzf-1.3.tar.gz
The files in the kernel diverge a tiny bit (being a slight subset), and I
think it's easiest to just add the additional notice to the files:
   kernel/power/lzf/lzf_c.c
   kernel/power/lzf/lzf_d.c
The following should be applied to both files:
