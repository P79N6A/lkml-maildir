False alert ! In fact, Paulus rewrote that stuff a while ago and I
totally forgot about it. We no longer do that, our get_irq_desc()
is nowadays just doing (&irq_desc[(irq)]). We map the large
physical interrupt numbers to "virtual" numbers that are the only
thing the generic code sees, so it's fine.
