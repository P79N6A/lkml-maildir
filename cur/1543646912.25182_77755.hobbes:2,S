OK. If you say that the vpath support is troublesome, I will believe
you :)

I think I said to you before that implementing a runtime solution to a
build time problem is a little bizarre IMHO. I would *much* rather have
4 lines of slightly icky Makefile than complicate *any* runtime code.
I suppose it would not be much more complicated than a request_module()
inside oprofile_init(), but it's still more code for next-to-zero
benefit ...
