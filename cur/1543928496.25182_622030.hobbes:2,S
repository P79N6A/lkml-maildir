Since we now *know* that this is how it has to be done
(as otherwise the BIOS would never even attempt DCO here
because most drives don't support it yet),
then ignoring the return value seems to be a useful strategy.

Mmmm.. I agree there, too!  I'm not big on filtering out commands
that *we* don't happen to like, but for this specific opcode, yes.
