Linux, BSD since 1990 or so.... For that matter I can do the same for
dynamically linked applications at library level. The difference is that
I don't have a happy point-and-click UI for it I have to go write a
little bit of code and the efficiency level. The SuSE proposed patch for
syscall restriction conveniently offers a way to remove the overhead.
