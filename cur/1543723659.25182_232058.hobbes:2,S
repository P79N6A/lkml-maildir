Not quite single mode, but what I have done in similar situations is 
boot with
console=ttyS0 init=/bin/sh
which will give a shell on /dev/console before any init scripts have 
run.  At
this point mount -o remount,rw / and edit the inittab (you might need 
to mount
/usr depending on your configuration).   To get back, unmount the 
filesystems,
remount root read-only, and either reboot or (from the first shell)
exec /sbin/init -s to follow the normal bootup to single mode (Be sure 
you
remounted root ro in this case or your init scripts will likely fail).
