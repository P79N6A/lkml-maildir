Hi, I have a Matrox G200 card installed on an Ali motherboard.
Sometimes when I use any opengl program my box crashes. It is more 
likely that it will crash if I have used the xvideo extension or the 
matroxfb, but this is not a must, it simply increases the chance of a 
crash, which is very high anyway.
I have tried both 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 kernels with Xfree 4.0.2 both with the 
same results.
Another problem I am having is that if I enable dri in X I can't see 
what I type in the fb.
Please, if someone reports to this, please include myself in the cc, as 
I am not suscribed to the list.
PD: excuse my horrible English, I write much better in Spanish ;-)
