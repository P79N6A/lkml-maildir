Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww... We don't need to implement Weirdnix - Dave Cutler
had already done that. The whole Missed'em'V IPC thing is a completely
fucked up API (OK, as the whole Missed'em'V API is) and we'ld better add a
filesystem, and mount it during the boot like every honest UNIX should do
with filesystems. But doing it via magic names? Yuk. _Please_, don't do
that. Besides, that's where the hell gates are waiting - wanna bet how
long will it take for some VMS-lover to "extend" your //root to
//FOO$BAR$BAZ: "functionality"?
