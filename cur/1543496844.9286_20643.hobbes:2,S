it's faster for the aligned buffer, multiple-of-four len case, it's
slower when len&3, and it's a lot slower for the unaligned buffer case.

see my previous msg, for explanation.
(basically, you get an impressive 0.5% speed increase ;), 
 but take a significant hit (44%) in case the buffer isn't
 properly aligned)

i found this amusing, but (a) it's not my code, and (b) just because
you might not know what it does does not make that code 'buggy'.

haven't seen any such post yet.

and? :)

well, if you really expect anybody to look at this why don't you
show a case where the original code fails... Since it works, as you say,
"only by _luck_" this shouldn't be very hard :^)
