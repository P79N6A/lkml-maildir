Have not received a response, so let's try this the other way.  I took
a closer look and found that my concern should be addressed by the
following one-liner:
diff --git a/drivers/dma/fsldma.c b/drivers/dma/fsldma.c
index 902e852..cc9a681 100644
--- a/drivers/dma/fsldma.c

        /* If it current transfer is the end-of-transfer,
With your ack I'll push the driver plus this fixlet for the current kernel.
