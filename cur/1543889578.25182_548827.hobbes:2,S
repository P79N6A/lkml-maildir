Not just the symlink ... we get rid of the changes in the two Makefiles,
the -D...SAFE stuff, some #ifdef's _and_ the macros listed above. Code
becomes even smaller and simpler. But yes, as I said, there'd be an
extra condition tested by the _unsafe variant (and *only* the _unsafe
variant, I must add) at the locations of these macros that was compiled
away previously. As for performance hit, I'd be interested in actually
measuring it first ... I definitely wouldn't mind trading off a couple of %
for a simpler and smaller patch.
But if you don't want even _that_ performance hit, you could also
simply duplicate the decompress() like Richard has done.

This test module isn't so performance benchmarking friendly, good
enough for checking correctness of the algorithm implementation and
robustness of the code. But I think Richard's cryptoapi glue code patch
would work for your version too, as both your interfaces are the same,
so that'd be a better way to benchmark the relative performance of
your patch vs his. If you can test/benchmark both your versions and
produce results that beat his code, you've made it :-)
