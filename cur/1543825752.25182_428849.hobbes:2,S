ok. How about a CONFIG_DEBUG_NO_OVERHEAD option, that would default to 
disabled but which you could set to y. Then we could make all the more 
expensive debug options:
	default y if !CONFIG_DEBUG_NO_OVERHEAD
this would still mean you'd have to turn off CONFIG_DEBUG_NO_OVERHEAD, 
but it would be automatically maintainable for you after that initial 
effort, and we'd be careful to always flag new debugging options with 
this flag, if they are expensive. And initially i'd define "expensive" 
as "anything that adds runtime overhead".
would this be acceptable to you?
