 hallo , 
Thanks for the quick reply !
However, after make clean && make mrproper have been done, the same error
message:
[root@edge1 linux-2.2]# make xconfig
rm -f include/asm
rm: include/asm: is a directory
make: *** [symlinks] Error 1
 appears
There is also an error message from make mrproper :
rm -f include/asm
rm: include/asm: is a directory
How should I resolve this ?
ciao

You tried doing a make clean && make mrproper first in the
/usr/src/2.2.5_New before doing make xconfig.  I think I had this
problem
before.

hallo , 
To back up a linux source directory, I tried a $ cp -Rr
/usr/src/linux2.2.5
/usr/src/2.2.5_New
and then I made the soft link to point to the new directory.
My question is why does 'make xconfig' or any 'make config' in the new
directory does not work ,even though the .config file is the same in the
original and the new one?
 The following errors are encountered.
    rm -f include/asm
   rm: include/asm: is a directory
   make: *** [symlinks] Error 1
But strange enough, make xconfig works in the original old kernel source
directory. 
Thanks !
