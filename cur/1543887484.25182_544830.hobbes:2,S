I just got finished configuring the 2.6.22-rc1 kernel and noticed that
the driver for my GTCO USB Digitizer isn't listed anymore.  For that
matter, non of the tablet drivers appear to be there.  I did notice that
there is a new Tablet section but, it's empty.  Will the Tablet drivers
be put back in for the 2.6.22 release?
