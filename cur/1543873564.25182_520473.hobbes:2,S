This is still true, I didn't bother fixing it because I'd rather expend "bay
time" trying to get the generic driver to work OK in thinkpads, but I have
been otherwise distracted with other ibm-acpi things, like a sysfs
conversion.

This is also still true.
BTW, currently the bay driver seems to have lost a lot of functionality, I
remember older incarnations of it (before it went platform-driver) caused
unplugs to be clean instead of driving libata nuts...  Am I recalling this
incorrectly?

Nor do I, and sincerely, if one is doing what some rpm distros are and
loading every ACPI module in a for loop at boot time, I don't want to know.
It is their mess to fix.  I just have ibm-acpi in my /etc/modules, and
arranged it to be loaded BEFORE any such distro crap (not that Debian has
it, but still...).
What we *can* do is to have DMI-based coldplug capabilities added, and work
from there to get udev to autoload devices.  And that still won't be 100%
failure-proof, but nothing is.

That's something I'd like to happen.
