indeed it's not aligned:
	c010025c T cpu_gdt_descr
could you align it by adding this line replacing the ALIGN line that
preceeds the cpu_gdt_descr definition in head.S:
	.align 32
we want to align the GDT to 32 bytes anyway, we have optimized it for
cache layout, and didnt realize that it wasnt aligned to begin with ...

i agree, so unless you can find the source of the problem and we can fix
the generic GDT, your patch is the right solution.
but, the right GDT layout might affect things like APM or PNP BIOS
compatibility, so it would be useful to figure out what's wrong with the
main GDT nevertheless.
