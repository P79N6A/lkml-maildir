Hi,
I have a strange problem (preventing me from testing the latest
2.4 kernel ... *sigh*) with my LVM setup.
The latest LVM utils + the latest kernel works just fine on my
test machine, but breaks horribly on my workstation. The only
difference I have found is that one PV of my VG has "NOT available"
as PV Status ...
--- Physical volume ---
PV Name               /dev/hda5
VG Name               vg0
PV Size               4.4 GB / NOT usable 2.56 MB [LVM: 124 KB]
PV#                   3
PV Status             NOT available
Allocatable           yes
Cur LV                0
PE Size (KByte)       4096
Total PE              1125
Free PE               1125
Allocated PE          0
Any chance of getting the LVM utilities fixed ?
I'd hate to see LVM be the showstopper for 2.4
(then again, the way the LVM team has neglected
everything from backwards compatability to even
documenting such is pretty much a showstopper in
itself ...)
regards,
Rik
