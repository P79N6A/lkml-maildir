   If now, the PCI stuff is claimed to be cleaned up, then _all_ the
   hacks have to be removed definitely.  As a result, the driver will
   not work anymore on Sparc64, neither on PPC and I am not sure it
   will still work on Alpha, in my opinion.
Actually Gerard, in your current 2.4.x NCR53c8xx and SYM53c8XX drivers
only real ifdefs for sparc64 are printf format strings for PCI interrupt
numbers :-)
Really, in 2.4.x sparc64 requires PCI config space hackery no longer.
