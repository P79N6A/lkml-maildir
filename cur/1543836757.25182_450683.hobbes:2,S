There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.

Not necessarily -- if you do it on flush, and store it near the data it 
relates to, you can expect a similar impact to compression, except that 
due to slow disks, the compression can actually speed things up 2x, 
whereas checksums should be some insignificant amount slower than 1x.
Redundancy, sure, but checksums should be easy, and I don't see what 
robustness (abilities of fsck) has to do with it.

That's an example of TANSTAAFL, if it's true.
