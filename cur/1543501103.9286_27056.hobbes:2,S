Simply get a set of modular DB9 and DB25 connectors. You can get them
with RJ45 on the back, and you can wire them up as you see fit. Then
simply use a 30 ft flatcable with RJ45 connectors on both ends. Or 50 ft.
Or 3 ft. Whatever you like.
I have several of those connectors, and several cables. It's like lego -
you can make all combinations you wish. M/F, M/M, cross, etc. And NO
soldering required.
