Hi (tm),
I'm a newbie to this list and after reading the faq and some of the
archives ( whee, high volume ! ) I still have a question.
Is there any work done on getting the 32bit UID patches for IA32 
( 
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/highuids/
 ) in the
official kernel ?
I work for this small countries largest hosting provider and we run 
Linux on IA32 machines, over 16K users now and business is good.
In other words, we 'd really like to know if we will have to do weird
things when we hit 64K users, estimated some time next year.
Cheers,
