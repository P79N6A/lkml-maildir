H Folks -
Does anyone know if there is support in the Linux kernel for a Promise
Technolog Ultra Wide SCSI PCI Controller Card?
These are the specs on the card:
                    ULTRA WIDE SCSI PCI CONTROLLER CARD  (mfg part# SCSIULTRA40) 
                   Description:
                   PCI Ultra Wide SCSI card that supports up to 15 Ultra Wide devices. Provides burst rates up to 40MB/sec
                   (synchronous) and 20MB/sec (asynchronous) On board BIOS for bootablity. Symbios Logic chipset. Equivalent to
                   Adaptec 2940UW card
                   Features: 
                         -Supports up to 40MB/sec data transfer rate
                         -Supports up to 15 Ultra Wide SCSI devices
                         -Includes 68-pin cable 
From the reading the hardware howto it is clear that the Adaptec 2940 UW card
is supported but no mention is made of the Promise cards?  Are they equivalent?
Thanks.....
