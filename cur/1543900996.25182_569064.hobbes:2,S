Subject: [PATCH 0/12] drivers/isdn: replace pci_find_device with pci_get_device

Hi;
Following patches replaces pci_find_device with pci_get_device (with some 
whitespace cleanups) to avoid following warnings;
warning: `pci_find_device' is deprecated (declared at include/linux/pci.h:478)
occured while compiling the kernel for ages.
Although ISDN subsystem marked as Maintained, last activity on ISDN 
subsystem's git tree occured 21 Month ago :( so for this reason i'm adding 
LKML also.
