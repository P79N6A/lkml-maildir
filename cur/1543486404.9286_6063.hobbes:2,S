Your program is incorrect. clock() returns clock_t, not int. clock_t
is long in glibc 2.1, so on a 32 bit architecture this would help
nothing...
Certainly a result of -1 is less than useful. But perhaps it conforms
to some standard ;-| Since clock() is a libc function you should ask the
libc maintainers about it.
