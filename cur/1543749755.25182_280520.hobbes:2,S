From this place of the world here, your "nation" is part of the United
States of America (U.S.A.). For the purposes of international law,
your "nation" would have to be subject to the international court of
justice in The Hague, an institiution that is not recognized by the
U.S.A.
So I don't care about any "federal governement classified
organization". As long as your "nation" does not have a seat at the
U.N., you are a part of the U.S.A., just as Kansas.
End of story. Stop spreading FUD.
