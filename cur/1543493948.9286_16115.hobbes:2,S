Somehow during all this "crisis" (which has nothing to do with the kernel,
BTW) nobody mentioned that on
ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/filesystems/
 there is a credible
utility for an automatic guessing of lost partition tables.  It is
called gpart<something-or-another>.
I think also that Gordon Chaffee had also another one on his web page
(
http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/,
 I believe).
