Not refcounting enables/disables gets to be a PITA though; that's
why the the IRQ and clock frameworks gave up on the not-counted
versions of their enable/disable calls a long time ago.
The typical problem scenario is that two parts of the same driver
have independent needs to make sure something is enabled.  If it's
not OK to enable() something that's already enabled(), the driver
itself will need to reinvent a refcounting scheme.
That kind of refcount patch would be a net code shrink anyway.  :)

As in, an LCD display and its touchscreen might be in
the same power domain (regulator_dev, internal to the
framework) but would have different regulator structs.
In that case the most likely scenario would be two
drivers needing to enable() so it's not trying to
talk to controllers that are powered off.  Voltage
would normally be fixed.

Right, I wasn't talking about changing that model.
