Thanks for your excellent work.
There is a slight problem with your -dj2 patch with following chunk:
diff -urN --exclude-from=/home/davej/.exclude 
linux-2.5.5/include/linux/version.h linux-2.5/include/linux/version.h
--- linux-2.5.5/include/linux/version.h	Thu Feb 21 17:42:30 2002
+++ linux-2.5/include/linux/version.h	Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970
@@ -1,3 +0,0 @@
-#define UTS_RELEASE "2.5.5"
-#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132357
-#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))
make distclean removes ../include/linux/version.h and thus your patch 
doesn't apply cleanly on a fresh 2.5.5 tree.
Best regards,
