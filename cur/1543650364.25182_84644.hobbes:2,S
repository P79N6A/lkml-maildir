Tim Witham at the OSDL told me that he ran some experiments with
different convergent deltas:
  zero Rate (ops/sec) Iteration Rate
 10-6    331,300    1656.5
 10-8    315,049    1575.0
 10-10    302,000    1510.0
 10-12    292,300    1461.5
 10-14    285,400    1427.0
Anything smaller than 10-14 didn't converge.
