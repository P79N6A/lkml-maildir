Actually, it's the fact that the code you show runs in ___do_softirq().
In full PREEMPT_RT, that should never happen.
Well, there is one case that that code can run. It's when hardirqs and
softirqs have the same prio, and the hardirq is bound to a single CPU.
But we've had so much trouble with running softirqs from hardirq threads,
that I've disabled it for -rt3.
I'll be (hopefully) releasing -rt3 tonight. I'm not including this patch
because it should never hit those code paths. But feel free to complain if
you still see this issue, and it goes away with the patch. Actually, I've
been thinking of adding a
#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
	WARN_ON(1);
#endif
at the start of ___do_softirq();
