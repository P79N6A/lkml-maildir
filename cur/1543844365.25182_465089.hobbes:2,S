had some time to think about it since yesterday: RCU reaping is done in 
softirqs (check out the softirq-rcu threads on your -rt box), that's why 
i removed the delayed-task-drop code to begin with. Now i dont doubt 
that you saw crashes under 2.6.17 - but did you manage to figure out 
what the reason is for those crashes, and do those reasons really 
necessiate the pushing of task-reapdown into yet another set of kernel 
threads?
