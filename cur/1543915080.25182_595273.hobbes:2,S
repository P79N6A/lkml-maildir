Hi all!
I've just released my first beta of Linux Network Load Balancing....
it's a driver (+ userland tool) to make decentered load balancing
clusters.
I hope someone is interested in the project and could do some testing
in decent environments (I've just done some "laboratory" test in a 3
virtualized node cluster environment, but nothing more than this).
Sources and some documentation on 
http://lnlb.sourceforge.net/
Greetings,
