Numtasks controller is a simple resource controller that provides user the
ability to
	- control the number of tasks a class can have
	- control the rate at which forks happen in the system
Patch descriptions:
1/6: ckrm_numtasks_init
	- Hooks up with CKRM core by defining the basic alloc/free
	  functions and registering the controller with the core.
2/6: ckrm_numtasks_tasksupport
	- Adds task management support by defining a function to be called
	  from fork() to see if the class is within its share allocation
	- sets interface to be called from core when a class is moved to a
	  class.
3/6: ckrm_numtasks_shares_n_stats
	- sets interface to be called from core when a class's shares are
	  changes or when stats are requested.
4/6: ckrm_numtasks_config
	- Use module parameters to dynamically set the total numtasks
		and maximum forkrate allowed
5/6: ckrm_numtasks_forkrate
	- Adds support to control the forkrate in the system.
6/6: ckrm_numtasks_docs
	- Documents what the numtasks controller does and how to use it.
