That hda to sda looks funny.  I didn't know the T43 has a SCSI (which I'm
pretty sure it doesn't).

Are you sure the initrd was correctly made. That pivot_root seems to
suggest that it wasn't.  You're using Debian. When I went from 2.4 to 2.6
I just used aptitude (or apt-get) to get the 2.6 kernel first, and let the
package manager make all the necessary changes for me.  I also usually
don't use an initrd and just compile in the drivers for my ide and
filesystems.
