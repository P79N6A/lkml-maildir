I don't know of any RevG.  Please explain.

OK, I'll back it out.

OK, KERN_WARN then.

Will do.

OK, well it's good to have your comment in the mail archives for when
someone tries to fix this globally.

I'm going to be ugly, but if someone to beautify it later, I won't oppose.

Right.  But that's exactly what I'm doing.  If I understand correctly,
your complaint is just that I'm doing the CPU-independent stuff in one
place (before branching to the CPU-specific code), and it would be
better to create duplicate code?  If I do it your way, I'll need to do
something gross in entry_64.S.  Specifically, thermal_interrupt() will
need to change from:
--------------------------
ENTRY(thermal_interrupt)
	apicinterrupt THERMAL_APIC_VECTOR,smp_thermal_interrupt
END(thermal_interrupt)
--------------------------
to:
--------------------------
ENTRY(thermal_interrupt)
        push %rax
        mov ($some_memory_location), %rax
	apicinterrupt THERMAL_APIC_VECTOR,%rax
        pop %rax
END(thermal_interrupt)
--------------------------
which might not work, depending on how apicinterrupt is defined, and
how easily I can get $some_memory_location loaded with the right
value.
Is this the fix you have in mind?
