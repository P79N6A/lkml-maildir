kexec: Avoid migration of already disabled irqs (ia64)
This patch fixes up ia64 kexec support for HP rx2620 hardware. It does this 
by skipping migration of already disabled irqs. This is most likely a problem
on other ia64 platforms as well, but I've only been able to reproduce it on
one machine so far.
The full story is that handle_bad_irq() gets invoked before starting the new 
kernel without this patch. This seems to happen when fixup_irqs() calls 
generic_handle_irq() on already migrated (and disabled) irqs. So by avoiding
migration of disabled irqs we stay away of handle_bad_irq().
The code has been tested on three different ia64 machines, all with good 
results. It is possible to trigger the same bug by offlining a processor
using echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online.
