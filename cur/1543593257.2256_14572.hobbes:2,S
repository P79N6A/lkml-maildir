Do you already have checks for signed/unsigned issues?  Those often result
in security problems, although you may already be checking for them simply
for reliable-code purposes.  ...Hm, looking at the archives, I see Chris
Evans responded about signedness issues when you asked last month :-P
You may want to check out and/or subscribe to the security-audit list; most
of the discussion is about userland security issues but kernel problems (or
potential  ones) are discussed as well.  We have archives of the list at:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-audit&r=1&w=2
And see

 for more info, subscribing,
etc.
