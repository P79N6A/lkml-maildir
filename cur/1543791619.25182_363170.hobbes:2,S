And confirming:
cd ~
tar xvjf linux-2.6.14.tar.bz2
cd linux-2.6.14
make allyesconfig
cd ~
tar xvzf klibc-1.1.tar.gz
cd klibc-1.1
ln -s ~/linux-2.6.14/include/asm-i386 include/asm
ln -s ~/linux-2.6.14/include/asm-generic/ include/asm-generic
ln -s ~/linux-2.6.14/include/linux include/linux
make  
Does indeed build klibc.
I get the strong feeling klibc-1.1 should be called klibc-2.6.14, but oh 
well...
