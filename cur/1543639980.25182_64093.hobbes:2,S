why are you useing loops for delays in the first place? it's a solution
that will fail as clock speeds keep improving (if for no other reason then
your loop counter will end up needing to be a larger int to achieve the
desired delay!!)
rather then debating how to convince gcc how to not optimize them away and
messing up the timing we should be talking about how to eliminate such
loops in the first place.
