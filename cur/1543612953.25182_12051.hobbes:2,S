I called them... The girl who received call was very friendly, wanted
to assign me bug#, but I resisted. I told her your bug#, but only
reply I got was something like "all our bug numbers begin with 1327",
and she apparently had no access to global database. I am not sure the
person knew what I was talking about.
He told me there's updated bios, somewhere. Did you try that?
What exactly is wrong? You said PIR tables are broken, but with patch
below, it seems to work. What's wrong?
