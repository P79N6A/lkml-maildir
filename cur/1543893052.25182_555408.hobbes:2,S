We use vmem_map on 390:
- __segment_load[arch/s390/mm/extmem.c] calls add_shared_memory() to 
create struct page entries behind a segment
- segment_unload (same file) calls remove_shared_memory() to remove 
parts of the mem_map array again
- arch/s390/mm/vmem.c implements both callbacks
As far as I know, this can also be archived with sparsemem. 
Unfortunately I don't have an example for sparsemem at hand, I would 
try to use sparse_add_one_section()[mm/sparse.c].
sorry,
Carsten
