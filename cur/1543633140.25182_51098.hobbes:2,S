	This seems correct to me. A read or write will not block and there is 
nothing to wait for.

	Because the socket is ready for read. If a read were attempted immediately, 
it would not block. If a read would result in an error other than 
'EWOULDBLOCK', the socket is ready to be read.

	I'm guessing the previous erroneous behavior was fixed. When you 'select' on 
an unconnected socket, what do you expect 'select' to wait for?
