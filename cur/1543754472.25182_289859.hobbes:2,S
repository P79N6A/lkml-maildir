Exactly.  And since that's a prerequisite for any meaningful review,
some equivalent of that work will have to be done at some point.
The only question is who will be doing that work - proponents of patch
or reviewers?
Look at it that way: when you are submitting a paper for publication,
it's your responsibility to get it into form that would allow review.
Sending a lump of something that might, given considerable efforts, be
massaged into readable and understandable text is not going to fly.
And doing that with "it's a lot of work [so could reviewers please do
that work themselves and spare me the efforts]" as rationale...
