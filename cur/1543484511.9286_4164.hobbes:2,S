Subject: I can't get 2.2.1 to work with ne2000 (linksys boards)

I have two machines with linksys ne2000 compatibles...
I had no problem with redhet 5.2 (2.0.36).
DHCP doesn't send out any packets...
It seems it needs a kick start (when I ifconfig manually,
ping into the box doesn't work, ping out does, once this
starts working, the network interface works fine...)
This is really strange...any ideas/advice?
