Not too sure what you mean here..  the "i" requires an immediate
argument (an integer).  So you need some construct which will allow the
compiler to generate a constant.  You could use
	(char *)&things.stuff - (char *)&things
I'd expect the compiler to turn that into a constant, but it doesn't
make much diff.

This is different.  The example I sent only used `dummy' so that the
`.equ' asm was within function context.  It'll generate something like:
	.globl	dummy
dummy:
	.equ	STUFF_OFFSET,$8
	ret
`dummy' will never be called.  You can place any number of `.equ'
pseudo-ops in `dummy'.

Good!
The .equ hack merits more playing with, because it could be used to cure
the awkward stuff in entry.S.  It may cause the generation of 16 bit
offsets where 8 bit would suffice, but that may be fixable.  I'll append
it to my TTD list :)
