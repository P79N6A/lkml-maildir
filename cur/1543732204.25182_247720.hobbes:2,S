You won't know before you try it ofcourse. It helps on my 85xx controllers.
The problem is that the internal queue size of some 3ware controllers
(queue_depth) is larger than the I/O schedulers nr_requests so that
the I/O scheduler doesn't get much chance to properly order and merge
the requests.
I've sent patches to 3ware a couple of times to make queue_depth
writable so that you can tune that as well, but they were refused
for no good reason AFAICS. Very unfortunate - if you have 8 JBOD
disks attached, you want to set queue_depth for each of them to
(max_controller_queue_depth / 8) to prevent one disk from starving
the other ones, but oh well.

Can't say, depends on your distribution. For recent Debian at
least you can use /etc/sysctl.conf
