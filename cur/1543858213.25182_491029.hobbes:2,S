I suppose you're talking about the cpqfc driver? I have tried to clean it up 
but gave up. Next try was to rewrite, but due to lack of time there is no 
progress in the last month. The old driver was that horrible coded that noone 
can maintain it. It was originally written for something like Linux 2.2 and 
was never even forward ported completely to 2.4. With the major changes in 
Linux' driver model that went into 2.6 it was nearly unusable anyway. Not 
that the use of it in 2.4 can be encouraged. One of the main problems is the 
severe lack of error handling which you can see alone from the fact that 
there are tons of function returning void even in the critical I/O-path's.
I have heard of at least 3 different people before you (not counting me) that 
would like to have a driver for this one. One even donated some hardware to 
me around last christmas. But nevertheless my lack of time stopped my work on 
this.
Martin, you were hacking on something there too but never showed up some code. 
Is there anything new?
