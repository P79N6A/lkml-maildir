Additional defect:
Support for the 16-bit IDE card KME KXL-C005 was added to the external
PCMCIA package a couple of years ago, and has finally been copied into the
kernel for 2.6.0.  But it doesn't work in 2.6.0-test3.
cardctl ident gets it right:
Socket 1:
  product info: "KME", "KXLC005", "00"
  manfid: 0x0032, 0x0704
  function: 8 (SCSI)
Of course the card is lying, it's really IDE.
2.6.0-test3 gets it wrong:
Aug 17 16:39:01 diamondpana cardmgr[540]: socket 1: KME KXLC005 CD-ROM
Aug 17 16:39:01 diamondpana cardmgr[540]: executing: 'modprobe -v ide_cs'
Aug 17 16:39:02 diamondpana cardmgr[540]: + insmod /lib/modules/2.6.0-test3/kernel/drivers/ide/legacy/ide-cs.ko
Aug 17 16:39:02 diamondpana cardmgr[540]: bind 'ide_cs' to socket 1 failed: Invalid argument
lsmod agrees that the module name is different from the filename:
Module                  Size  Used by
ide_cs                  6400  0
So the problem indeed seems to be an invalid argument in binding.
