Makes some sense - although the inode one should just take a hike at this
point. Can the fastboot option live under staging perhaps - its analogous
to staging drivers although clearly the code doesn't go there in this
case ?
The trouble otherwise is "fast boot" sounds like something good for
people to turn on, but right now it's the reverse.
