Hi
This patchset moves le*_add_cpu and be*_add_cpu functions from OCFS2 to core
header (1st), converts ext3 filesystem to this API (2nd) and replaces
XFS different named functions with new ones (3rd).
There are many places where these functions will be useful.
Just look at: grep -r 'cpu_to_[ble12346]*([ble12346]*_to_cpu.*[-+]' linux-src/
Patch for ext3 is an example how conversions will probably look like.
ps: this patchset depends on 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/25/35
 (which is
    in ocfs2 git tree, branches: trivial, ALL)
