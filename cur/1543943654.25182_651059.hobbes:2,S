A long time ago I played with this, using a sparse based tool that was
inserted as the compiler and modified the code before passing to gcc,
i.e. a pre-pre-processor:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/acme/sparse/initstr.c
I couldn't find in the archives, but IIRC some extra pages were freed
after boot, i.e. strings moved from .data to .init.data.
With a tool like this the advantage is that no source code has to be
changed, strings in __init functions are automagically moved to
.init.data, the disadvantage is that not all strings can be moved to
.init.data as there were (are?) subsystems that keep pointers to the
string passed and another tool would be involved in the build process.
