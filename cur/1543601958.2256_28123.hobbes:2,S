Different layer really: The idea was to sync blocks contiguous to the
dirty block we want to sync (regardless of filesystem, i.e. similar to
the elevator which also works at abelow-the-fs-level). (Allocated) block
numbers are necessary for this to work.
(but i don't know how relevant this is in practise. I think it might gain
a lot, though, but that doesn't mean much ;)
