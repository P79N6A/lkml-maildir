Calling this tool simply with an argument (eg. CD to write) and
accepting commands from stdin, outputting status info on stdout
and errors on stderr is even simpler and requires no API changes ;-)

With my suggested change this is done implicitly.
But with that cookie suggestion in place, to remove the ability
for fds to be reference countable, since the user can build
circular dependencies now, which he for now can just do with
AF_UNIX sockets.
