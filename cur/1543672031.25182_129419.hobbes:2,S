I'm wanting to get this new toy up and running.  I've installed apcupsd, 
but it doesn't want to work well with my kernel (2.5.68) or somewhat.
When apcupsd tries to open the hiddev, open() gets an ENODEV.  Is 
apcupsd doing something wrong or is 2.5.68 doing something wrong?

p.s. apcupsd needs patched to handle hiddev from 96 on (minor allocated by kernel)
