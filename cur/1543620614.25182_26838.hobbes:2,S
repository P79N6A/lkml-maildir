I don't want to handle the wrapper function too much.  IMHO it is the
job of the driver to do locking if needed.  For some read-only ioctls
like VIDIOCGCAP you don't need locking at all.

video_open does call video_device[minor]->fops->open(), isn't that
enought?

Sorry, I don't understand.  What exactly do you mean?
file->private_data?  videodev.c doesn't touch it ...
