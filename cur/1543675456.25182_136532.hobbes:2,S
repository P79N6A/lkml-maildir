Yes, 19470 entries.  But note that each entry is 4096 bytes.
Something seems to have gone and bumped the object size from 240 bytes up
to 4096.  This is actually what I want CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC to do, but I
don't think it does it yet.  
Bongani, if you have CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC enabled then please try turning
it off.  And maybe Manfred can throw some light on what slab has done
there.
