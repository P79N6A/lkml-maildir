OK. In any event, I figured out how to fix it in RTLinux. It would be
easier for me if there was a macro 
               low_level_irq_controller_spin_lock(x);
which could be defined as 
               spin_lock_irqsave(x)
in standard Linux.
and as
                rtl_hard_irqsave_spinlock(x)
in RTLinux.
Also, it's critical that those locks _never_ be exposed outside of the
lowest level routines. 
So can you answer my questions about  the effect of postponing the 
ack until after the handler executes.  Does that mask further ioapic
interrupts?
