Chris,
If you keep me posted on the patch when released (I'm not on the kernel 
list, too high volume for me) I'll be happy to give your patch a whirl 
on my test box against whichever kernel you patch.
Your last point is real good, how DOES Windows figure it out? In saying 
that, without the VIA drivers I only have USB1.1 support on this 
motherboard... Again, happy to test some theories if you have some tests 
you'd like ran...
Cheers,
:)Johny
