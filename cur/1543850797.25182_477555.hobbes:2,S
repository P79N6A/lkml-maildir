Again: Please read LDD3. It explains it well. Read all the "Remapping
RAM" chapter and you will understand what I've done, or just try to
remap RAM yourself with remap_pfn_range. (I really tried it using
different ways and I couldn't map it with remap_pfn_range, it returns
you a place full with zeros, as LDD3 states).
