Subject: [PATCH] Add help texts to drivers/net/irda/Config.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In drivers/net/irda/Config.in, there are two options which currently do
not have help texts in drivers/net/irda/Config.help.  Here are snippets
from the Config.in for these options:
if [ "$CONFIG_ARCH_EP7211" = "y" ]; then
    dep_tristate '  EP7211 I/R support' CONFIG_EP7211_IR $CONFIG_IRDA
fi
if [ "$CONFIG_ARCH_SA1100" = "y" ]; then
   dep_tristate 'SA1100 Internal IR' CONFIG_SA1100_FIR $CONFIG_IRDA
fi
Here is a patch to drivers/net/irda/Config.help to add these help texts.
