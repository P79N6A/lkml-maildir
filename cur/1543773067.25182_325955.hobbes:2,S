The filesystem needs to understand and translate the path names, if the
Filesystem specification mandates a different encoding for file names (for
example UTF-16). Thats why you fequently see translations in legacy
filesystems which have national encoding in the on-disk format (think FAT)
And if the filesystem uses unicode, you also need to enforce the naming of
files in UTF-8 to do reliable translation. Currently user mode may also send
you non-UTF8 national chars.
