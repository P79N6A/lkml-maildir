Subject: [PATCH 1/2] x86: don't enable MCE after suspend/resume when system was booted with "nomce"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Impact: fix suspend/resume bug with MCE
A suspend/resume cycle unconditionally enables MCE
for the boot CPU if MCE is compiled into the kernel.
I.e. even a system booted with "nomce" configures MCE for the boot CPU.
This patch ensures that MCE is not turned on for systems booted with
"nomce".
