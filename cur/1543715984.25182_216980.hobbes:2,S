That sounds very strange.  Bogomips is supposed to be how many busy-wait loops the cpu can do in a 
second, or at least that's what I've seen in all the books.  It shouldn't matter what the time 
source is.
I would expect a NUMA machine to have different bogomips values for the different CPUs, but the 
values should still be the same as if that cpu was on a uniprocessor system, no?
