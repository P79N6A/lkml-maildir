Just a simple me, too. I've got the problem with a TerraCAM USB Pro. Plugged 
into my Apple Keyboard it works (with a warning about high power 
consumption). But if I plug it into my Belkin F5U237 the driver complains 
with: "drivers/usb/media/ov511.c: init isoc: usb_submit_urb(0) ret -38".
Have you already tried another USBv2 hub?
Cheers,
