I absolutely agree, that is the way I thought it would work
as all the information to build correctly is contained in the
Kconfig files.
But, as you say, kbuild does not work that way.
Changing kbuild to do that would take more time than
I can commit, so I don't have any room to complain about it.

Yes, the config is random, but the select statements are
specifically chosen to work with the existing kbuild.
Bottom line is the existing kbuild does not seem to
propagate reverse dependencies, so you have to explicitly
add them all with the select facility. Ugly, but not random.
In the end, it is your original patch (select WAN minus the Makefile
changes) that makes it work.
BTW: Thanks for spending your time on this (Randy and Krzysztof),
the exchange has been educational and useful.
