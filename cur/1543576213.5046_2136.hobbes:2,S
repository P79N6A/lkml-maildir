OUCH. The only protection we have against this is the fact
that atomic allocations are not allowed to eat up all memory
in the system and that every thread can only have 1 getblk
operation at a time, right?
But even so, the deadlock is still theoretically possible and
should probably be fixed, this sounds too much like a time
bomb waiting to go off... ;(

Rik
