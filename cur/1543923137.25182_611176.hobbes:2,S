I had to do a kernelspace driver for controlling the backlight. This
was part of a college project assignment. In order for it to be valid
for an operating system course, it had to be in kernelspace (not
Unix programming) :).
As i mentioned that can be done in userspace and it IS sensible to do
so. I know that the code which was already written for Dell implied
a userspace approach, but i simply had no choice.
I also don't expect this driver to become mainstream, but since i have
written it, other people might want to have a look at it.
Finally i really don't think there's any sensible way of implementing
Linux LCD Backlight Abstraction relying on a userspace application.
That would mean the kernel calling userspace code to change the
brightness, then this latter code would again call the kernel to trigger
a SMI and so on. That's just not a good design. I think a userspace
solution implies choosing NOT to implement the LCD Abstraction. Causing
Dell laptops to be treated differently from other machines (as they are
not compliant with Linux's own interface).
