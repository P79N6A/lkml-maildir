LOL.  My spamassassin marked 5/10 in the "P O R N_10" group, and
"DATE_IN_PAST_96_XX", but it was rescued by "UNIFIED_PATCH" and "AWL"
(spamassassin 2.31, but with some scores I set myself).  It got marked
that way because of the triple-x beside "fixme".  I have AWL set as a
pretty small negative number because people start spamming (viruses more)
with sender addresses of real people on l-k.
Cheers, Andreas
