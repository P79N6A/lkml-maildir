[1] glibc-2.3.4 kill buggy bins at the load time.
    (please look into: elf/dl-load.c, elf/dl-support.c, elf/rtld.c)
    This works on i386/PaX systems too (hardware NX isn't required).
[2] `readelf -Wl |grep GNU_STACK` shows RWE ;-)
Please look at this quick example.
# gcc tmp1.c tmp2-invalid.S -o tmp -s
# readelf -Wl tmp
(...)
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RWE 0x4
                                                                  ^ execstack?
  PAX_FLAGS      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000     0x4
(...)
Now, let's add section note to the asm. file and rebuild.
# gcc tmp1.c tmp2-valid.S -o tmp -s
# readelf -Wl tmp
(...)
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x4
  PAX_FLAGS      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000     0x4
(...)
The execstack req. disappeard (~99% of broken sources).
I get the same effect with fixed cflags and invalid source.
# gcc tmp1.c tmp2-invalid.S -o tmp -s -Wa,--noexecstack
# readelf -Wl tmp
(...)
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x4
  PAX_FLAGS      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000     0x4
(...)
I known several apps that really need executable data/stack (eg. jvm, xorg).
The rest of RWE-marked binaries have IMHO buggy sources.

IMHO the `as` should warn about missed (.note.GNU-stack) section.

Paweł.
