The original person who reported a problem to me used LVM, and 
in the course of discussion, the proc/partitions bug came to light.
The values pasted above are from a box with no LVM compiled.

As I mentioned in another mail, it seems that removable devices with
no media have no valid #blocks, and is thus getting poisoned.
