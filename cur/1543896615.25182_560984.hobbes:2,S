Well I've taken another look at the code and I think I can probably
restructure my code to use update_vsyscall().  I thought I needed a
hook that was called /only/ from settimeofday() (which as you say
doesn't match update_vsyscall()'s usage).
I'll try again and see what problems I hit.

Thanks. The one in -rt doesn't seem to support the VDSO.  however I see
that there is duplication of effort there.

Unless I miss your meaning, the vdso is updated in
timer_recalc_offset()/update_gtod() when needed.
