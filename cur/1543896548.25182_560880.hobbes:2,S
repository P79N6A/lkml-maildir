For my part, I think the 2.6.<odd> did not go as well as the 2.6.<even>,
beginning with x=16.

Back in the 2.4 days and e.g. on Solaris (still) today, a kernel
object file is [can be] a kernel module. Under Linux, this is not the

(creating these nice .mod.c and .mod.o files and the benefits
associated with it).
