KDE2.1.1 comes with a password disabling feature. That means that you can log 
in without password (you have to use KDM). For everything else (ftp, telnet, 
ssh, text-console-login - whatever) you still need the password. 
This is very new, KDE-versions prior to 2.1.1 don't have that feature AFAIK.
So if you've got physical access to the machine you just have to click on 
your icon/name and cklick "Go!" or press Enter. It can't get much easier than 
that.
I think this is a far better alternative than a single user Linux.
