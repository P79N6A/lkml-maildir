I was doing that all the time. I'm calling pci_enable_device(pdev), then
reading pdev->irq, then calling request_irq(pdev->irq,...). But I don't
get interrupts. Is it possible for the compiler to rearrange the order
of execution? 
I was talking about that strange phenonomenon you were saying with PLX
and interrupts going mad when initializing the device, ie the trick with
enable->disable->do whatever(this is where I need help if it applies to
me)->reenable. 
Thanks,
Dimitris
