Yes - and 5000 is as high as that parameter will go, so it won't keep
up with a heavier load.  I'm a little worried about your vmstat
numbers still, the repeated 2500 figure indicates that the per-cycle
write limit is getting halved somewhere.  
There was an age limit (35 secs, tunable) in the previous (2.2.7)
version of this code.  I removed it accidentally.  Your self-tuning
ideas are interesting, but for now let's just put back the age limit.
The appended patch *should* correct the problem.  I have not even
compiled it; if I get a chance, I'll try later tonight.  Linus, since
you put my patch into 2.2.8, this needs to be considered for 2.2.9 and
2.3.1.  And could you please look at what I've done and make sure I
haven't missed something else?  I don't know the buffer cache all that
well, and I was not expecting the patch to get incorporated without a
few rounds of testing first.
