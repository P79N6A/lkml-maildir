If you add attachments (which are harder to review because they cannot be 
quoted) put at least a copy of the description into the attachment and make
them inline.
One thing that's unclear to me is why you make the reserve hotadd Kconfig
user visible (and why put it into Kconfig at all). I don't think it should be 
user visible.
Also most of the patch seems to be renaming a variable which seems somewhat
pointless?
