  Ok, I thought of one thing that might make things clearer here: when I 
say "the write failed", I mean that we saw the write go out on the PCI bus 
and then the box locked up.  We were looking at it on a PCI bus analyzer. 
That, and it wasn't just this write, or just writes in general, it really 
seemed random.
  BTW, I don't know what PCI posting effects are...
