2.6.23-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: "Cory T. Tusar" <ctusar@videon-central.com>
patch db99247ac68fc352100090ad7704fb5efb9327b6 in mainline.
Commit 5a52bd4a2dcb570333ce6fe2e16cd311650dbdc8 introduced a subtle logic
change in tty_wait_until_sent().  The original version would only error out
of the 'do { ...  } while (timeout)' loop if signal_pending() evaluated to
true; a timeout or break due to an empty buffer would fall out of the loop
and into the tty->driver->wait_until_sent handling.  The current
implementation will error out on either a pending signal or an empty
buffer, falling through to the tty->driver->wait_until_sent handling only
on a timeout.
The ->wait_until_sent() will not be reached if the buffer empties before
timeout jiffies have elapsed.  This behavior differs from that prior to commit
5a52bd4a2dcb570333ce6fe2e16cd311650dbdc8.
I turned this up while using a little serial download utility to bootstrap an
ARM-based eval board.  The util worked fine on 2.6.22.x, but consistently
failed on 2.6.23.x.  Once I'd determined that, I narrowed things down with git
bisect, and found the above difference in logic in tty_wait_until_sent() by
inspection.
This change reverts the logic flow in tty_wait_until_sent() to match that
prior to the aforementioned commit.
