dhinds seemed to question the epic100 fix which is enclosed in
CONFIG_CARDBUS...  also I have a big endian fix for epic100 in my local
tree.
The change to hp-plus is totally unnecessary and backwards... 
[un]load_8390_module is null, has been for a while.  A bombing run was
made recently through most drivers to -remove- the now-null calls to
*_8390_module.
