real floating point in the kernel is basically no-go; especially if you
enable preemption. The entire floating point exception, context save and
restore engine is designed with the assumption of no kernel space FPU
usage... and there are a LOT of nasty corner cases to deal with... and
so far the kernel decided to cheap out on many of those by just not
allowing kernel FPU use (mmx is easier so that can be dealt with).
Volume 3 of the Intel architecture manuals are a good start if you want
to know what some of these corner cases are...
