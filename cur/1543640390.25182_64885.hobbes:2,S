Starting at line 722 of
linux-2.4.19/Documentation/filesystems/devfs/README:

I skimmed through the documentation and it appears to assume that you're
not deleting all the stuff in /dev before switching over to devfs.

Right, there's no way around that. If you deleted everything in /dev --
which you're not supposed to do -- then there's no way for anything to
find any devices if devfs isn't enabled. (And you should have a rescue
CD around anyway -- you never know when you might need it! BTW, what
distribution are you (Ed) using? Some distributions have special boot
options you can use when booting their install CDs to get into a rescue
mode.)
In any event, it might be a good idea to make the documentation a bit
more explicit about this, and I might send a patch to the mailing
list later today.
