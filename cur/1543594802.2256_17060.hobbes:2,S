So what? Crusoe isn't designed for use in supercomputers. It's designed
for use in laptops where the user is running an email reader, a web
browser, a word processor, and where the user couldn't give a cr*p about
performance as long as it isn't noticeable (20% *isn't* for those types
of apps), but where the user does give a cr*p about how long his or her
battery lasts (ie, the entire business day, and not running out of power
at lunch time).
Yes, it *can* be used in a supercomputer (or more preferably, a cluster
of Linux machines), or even as a server where performance isn't the
number one concern and things like power usage (read: anywhere in
California right now ;-) ), and rack size are important. You can always
get faster, more efficient hardware, but you'll pay for it.
Remember, the whole concept of code-morphing is that the majority of
apps that people run repeat the same slice of code over and over (eg,
a word processor). Once crusoe has translated it once, it doesn't need
to do it again. It's the same concept as a JIT java compiler.
/Mike - who doesn't work for Transmeta, in case anyone was wondering... :-)
