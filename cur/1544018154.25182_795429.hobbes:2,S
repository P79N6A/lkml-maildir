regulator: Add disable_on_boot flag to constraints.
Signed-off-by: Jonathan Cameron <jic23@cam.ac.uk>
Acked-by: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
---
Now based on voltage / for-next and with kernel doc
added.
Not quite sure what trashed the previous patch, but
hopefully this one should work.
Changes in response to Mark Browns comments.
Patch changed to disable_on_boot for more flexibility.
This only really involved removing the check in the enable code
found in the previous patch.
This is intended to allow the disabling of regulators during
registration.  Typical use case is regulators that aren't
actually connected to anything.
This is against a clean voltage for-next with Mark's 
hoisting of struct regulator_dev patch applied. (not that
it materially changes this patch).
