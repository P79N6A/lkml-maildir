You haven't shown me to be wrong. How exactly is it harmful to
err on the side of doing symbol lookups that aren't required?
Maybe you'd like an example; I'll provide one below.

Yes. So what?

Again, not a problem. Here is the example:
---- example crash ----
kernel NULL (0000002c) accessed from c01a4b98
GPRs c0294041 00000000 c01a4600 0000000a 00000200 c0258000 ffffffff

-----------------------
Then it gets run through a simple tool that never fails to look
up a symbol that needs to be looked up:
---- example report of the above crash ----
kernel NULL (0000002c) accessed from c01a4b98
GPRs c0294041 00000000 c01a4600 0000000a 00000200 c0258000 ffffffff

Trace: bad stack frame
Code: 8a739052 c000000a 41310001 87052926
Symbols:
c000000a __start
c0105344 qfs_frob_directory
c01a4600 qfs_cleaner
c01a4b98 qfs_hash_file_record
-------------------------------------------
Well, that first symbol (__start) was really "jump +10", but the
extra noise doesn't hurt anyone. You get what you need, no matter
how mangled the oops is. It can be word-wrapped, missing chunks...
The tool doesn't need to care.
Code disassembly is useful too, and again it is best to err on
the side of decoding more than is required. Remember that users
tend to mangle oops data. If the FCR register get disassembled
as a breakpoint instruction... hey, just ignore the extra noise.
When tools really try to understand an oops, they screw up.
They ignore data that should be looked up as symbols.
