Indeed, it seems commonly accepted that early 486SX where just plain
old 486DX with the FPU disabled (and slower clock IIRC).
Although this might seem stupid, there was one very good reason for doing it:
they could then claim the 386 as being dead (outdated and slow) so that people
would stop buying those AMD-386 for fear of getting frigid.
Why didn't they design a true 486SX right away ?  Maybe the yields on the 486DX
were too low so they figured they could feed the chips that failed the 486DX-25
tests to a 486SX-16 tester.  This is much less likely, tho, given the price of
testing chips.
