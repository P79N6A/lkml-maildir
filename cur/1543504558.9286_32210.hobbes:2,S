One can not overclock a Tyan Tomcat III S1563D with classic P5 non-mmx
processors.  The MMX P5 processors changed the 1.5X factor into 3.5X,
thus 233MHz.  Do this on a classic P5 and 66.0 x 1.5 -->> 100MHz.
If it is a hardware issue, I would look at total power requirements of the
system against the power supply, 250W min and prefer 300W.
