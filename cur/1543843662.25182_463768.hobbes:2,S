It seems like an agreement on this is coming together.  You and Karim
may be in violent agreement, even if others haven't quite come around:
Let us design a static marker mechanism that can be coupled at run
time either to a dynamic system such as systemtap, or by a specialized
tracing system such as lttnng (!).  Then "markers" === "static
instrumentation", for purposes of the kernel developer.  If the
markers are lightweight enough, then a distribution kernel can afford
keeping them compiled in.
