I think this all boils down to the fact that "lock_super()" really is a 
very old and broken interface. It pretty much harks back to the original 
filesystem code, and yes, every "lock_super()" _should_ probably be 
replaced by a lower-level lock.
I think ext2 was already fixed to use its own spinlocks for bitmap 
accesses, although it looks like somebody re-introduced "lock_super()" 
there for xattr handling.
[ Which in turn is probably just a bug, since nothing else uses it, so 
  having a single lock_user() in all of ext2 is almost certainly totally 
  pointless - there is nothing that it actually _protects_ against. I 
  guess it protects against "sync()", but that's pretty much it. ]
That said, I'd rather do any lock_super() cleanup totally _independently_ 
of a include file cleanup. 
So since it's clearly not performance-critical, how about just making it 
be out-of-line in fs/super.c, and turn the header file into just a 
declaration?
