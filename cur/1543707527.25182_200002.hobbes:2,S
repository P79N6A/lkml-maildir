Probably not always the right choice, though...  I highly suspect we
far to much of our intestines are easily available.

a.) Definitely
b.) Perhaps

Well, I wasn't altogether joking when I suggested IBM should GPL gpfs.
A couple of questions:
* Is gpfs a commercial product in the sense that it's something IBM
  earns revenue from?
* Does gpfs contain third party "Intellectual Property" (no, I'm not
  particularly fond of using that expression, but I digress)
If the answer is NO to both of these questions, why _not_ GPL the code?
If the answer is NO to only the second question, is the revenue from
gpfs big enough to warrant keeping it proprietary?

Yup.  Silence isn't always golden, sometimes it's outright shitty.
