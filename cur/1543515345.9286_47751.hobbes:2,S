I would somehow suppose that autofs is flexible enough that you can
solve this kinda things with it, by using executable maps which can
try and mount with several different filesystem types until the
mount succeedes or ultimately fails. Explicit fs type specification
should load the proper module AFAIK. The actual autofs configuration
for this treat is left as an excercise for the reader.
