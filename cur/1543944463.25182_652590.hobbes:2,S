Hmm. "-r" is a no-op to git-cherry-pick.
And even if you thought it should preserve committer information, it 
really _really_ shouldn't. You're creating a new commit, you're the new 
committer. The old committer is meaningless. It doesn't matter at all if 
you try to keep the old committer information (which you can do by faking 
GIT_COMMITER_NAME¦EMAIL): you're simply just _lying_ at that point. The 
original committer has a different commit in his tree, and if you try to 
claim that your cherry-picked commit is his, you're only doing everybody a 
disservice.
If you meant using "-x", then yes, that retains the actual pointer to the 
original commit, but it's not the default, because it shouldn't be used 
unless you plan to carry both around on purpose (ie it's mainly useful for 
"maintain a stable branch that has commits cherry-picked from mainline" 
kinds of things).
