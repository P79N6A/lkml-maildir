If you don't mind, I'd be happy to submit a diff to oops-tracing.txt with
exactly that text. Any possible hints on how to properly submit bug
reports should be sprinkled wherever we can put them. Thanks for the idea.

Just an attempt at dry, kernel-type humour, and I *completely* agree that
it can be easily taken the wrong way. I just figured it was in a kernel
source file that not too many "newbie" users would be looking at, and
therefore those who did see it would hopefully laugh and remember the time
when they weren't kernel big-boys and had no idea what an oops was. :)
Matter of fact I'll change it to "newbies"; that has better, more 
positive connotation.
The patch I've proposed isn't really a big deal. We've relied on those
users who *do* know how to use ksymoops and the like for a while, and it
hasn't hurt bugfixing too much. I just felt like it might be able to
extend the possible oops-reporting/bug-fixing population by giving people
a hint on what to read for further info.
Thanks all for your replies.
