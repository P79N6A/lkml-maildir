Yes.

I haven't dug in too deep but right now my concern are user space semantics,
I don't want to wind up with something ugly there because we can not change
it later.
So if we can write a description of what happens to signals to cinit
that is right 100% of the time.  Something we can write a test case
for that tests all of the corner cases and it always get the same
results. I am happy.
I don't mind dropping signals early as an optimization, but if it
is just an optimization we can't count on it in cinit.
So I would rather deliver less and make user space deal with it,
then deliver more cause problems for user space.
