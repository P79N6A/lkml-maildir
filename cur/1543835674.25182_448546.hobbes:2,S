Speaking of which, I have submitted a claim to Guiness Book of Records
for my uptime on a lowly 486 box that serves my webpages (via NFS) as
a 'home user' (I am sure business classed machines do better with UPS
etc.).  I have posted here twice when it hit 1000 days and then 1500
days:
[nick@486Linux nick]$ uname -a
Linux 486Linux 2.2.13-7mdk #1 Wed Sep 15 18:02:18 CEST 1999 i486 unknown
[nick@486Linux nick]$ last -xf /var/run/utmp runlevel
runlevel (to lvl 3)                    Sun Oct 14 16:07 - 16:42 (1751+00:34)
The claim has been accepted, and is now in evaluation... so I dunno
what happens next until I hear from them (or how it can be verified
unless someone pops along and I telnet into the box for them).
