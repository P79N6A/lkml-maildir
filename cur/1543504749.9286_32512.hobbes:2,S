Probably. I really think it's a matter of "if this device really doesn't
have any ordering constraints, then we can use the new nifty feature to
make it invisible to most users".
That still covers quite a lot of ground. Basically all PCI drivers, and a
lot of software-only initializations. Stuff that can now be safely handled
in modules, in short.
