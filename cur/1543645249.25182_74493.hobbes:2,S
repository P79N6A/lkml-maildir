Can anyone confirm this is his real name? This is simply not a typical
English name. If "Thunder from the hill" is his official name, I'll
apologize. Sometimes there are good reason (e.g. padeluun in Germany), but
until someone explains me this reason, this is just silly and I have real
problems to take this seriously.

The "C for dummies" mailing list is somewhere else.
