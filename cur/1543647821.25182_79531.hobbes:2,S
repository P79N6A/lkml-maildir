The 2.5.41 variant is below.  The bug is reusing the old enumeration value
as was previously mentioned.
/**
 * device_shutdown - queisce all the devices before reboot/shutdown
 *
 * Do depth first iteration over device tree, calling ->remove() for each
 * device. This should ensure the devices are put into a sane state before
 * we reboot the system.
 *
 * device_shutdown - call device_suspend with status set to shutdown, to 
 * cause all devices to remove themselves cleanly 
 */
void device_shutdown(void)
{
       struct list_head * node, * next;
       struct device * prev = NULL;
       printk(KERN_EMERG "Shutting down devices\n");
       spin_lock(&device_lock);
       list_for_each_safe(node,next,&global_device_list) {
               struct device * dev = get_device_locked(to_dev(node));
               if (dev) {
                       spin_unlock(&device_lock);
                       if (dev->driver && dev->driver->remove)
                               dev->driver->remove(dev);
                       if (prev)
                               put_device(prev);
                       prev = dev;
                       spin_lock(&device_lock);
               }
