Hmm - why should it suck so badly? Shouldn't USB 2 (yes I mean the
480Mbps) manage 40MByte/s+ ?
Disc struck me as so nice in the sense that its a file system and you
don't need extra software, and that the recovery time is near instant.
(Incidentally - putting it in a RAID1 with a main  disc would seem
an interesting option and just letting RAID take a copy of the file
system)
