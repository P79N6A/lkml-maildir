So, what could be said is that the sard (which IS in 2.4.19-per1-ac2) 
has features:
- all devices available (not only major < 16)
- stat struct is in the request_queue, not in kstat anymore
- All structs are dynamic, no static allocation of per-device structs.
So, it's all we need.
The only drawback is:
- infos are in /proc/partitions not in /proc/stat (some apps get infos 
there...)
Right?

PS: When will it be in official tree? An idea?
