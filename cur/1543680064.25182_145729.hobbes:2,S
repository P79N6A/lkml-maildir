Hi Folks,
   What are the major and minor fault counts in the struct task_struct
meant to count?
   On most Unix-like systems, a major fault is one that incurs I/O; a
minor fault (reclaim) is one that does not.  It appears that on Linux
2.5.74, some faults counted as `major' do not sleep (e.g., ones that
hit the swap readahead).
