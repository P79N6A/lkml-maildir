Here's a patch to get rid of clear_page_dirty() from jfs.  I'm not
convinced it was totally broken, but I'm not convinced it wasn't.
Either way, I don't think that bit of code was particularly beneficial.
Feel free to apply this patch independent of your patch if you really
think that jfs's use of clear_page_dirty is crap, or I can push it
through -mm first.
This patch removes some questionable code that attempted to make a
no-longer-used page easier to reclaim.
Calling metapage_writepage against such a page will not result in any
I/O being performed, so removing this code shouldn't be a big deal.
