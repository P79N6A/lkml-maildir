Ah, I see, I was missing the short-cut which avoids re-running parts  
of the write path if we're in a retry.
         if (!is_sync_kiocb(iocb) && kiocbIsRestarted(iocb)) {
                 /* nothing to transfer, may just need to sync data */
                 return ocount;
It's pretty subtle that this has to be placed before the first  
significant current reference and that nothing in the path can return  
-EIOCBRETRY until after all of the significant current references.
In totally unrelated news, I noticed that current->io_wait is set to  
NULL instead of &current->__wait after having run the iocb.  I wonder  
if it shouldn't be saved and restored instead.  And maybe update the  
comment over is_sync_wait()?  Just an observation.

Yeah, that's the hope.

Sure, though there are only so many hours in a day :).

Yeah.  I wanted to see what it would look like.

Wellll, that remains to be seen.  If nothing else we'll at least hav  
code to point at when discussing it.  If we all agree it's not the  
right way and dismiss the notion, fine, that's progress :).

That was my first pass, yeah.  It turned the knob a little too far  
towards the "invasive but efficient" direction for my taste.  I'm now  
giving it a try by having full stacks for each blocked op, we'll see  
how that goes.

I was allocating at block-time to keep memory consumption down, but I  
think my fiddling around with it convinced me that isn't workable.
