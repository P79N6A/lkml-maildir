Scott,
Information compartmentation (elimination of all inter-process
covert channels) is not the same thing as fault tolerance and
isolation.  A system could be very fault tolerant and still allow
covert communications via (as Bret says) time-varying CPU workload,
number of subprocesses forked, number of files created in /tmp, or many
other things.  Information compartmentation is really hard and not that
rewarding unless you're making systems for the NSA.
