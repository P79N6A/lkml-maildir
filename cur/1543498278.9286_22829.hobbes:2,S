  This message is directed at those almighty kernel developers.
  I have a Epox MVP3GM Mother board. When I shut down the system, that is
  power off, the kernel simply responds by crashing (After it's killed all
  the service). For some reason, it isn't the VIA82c586 Chipset. I've
  installed on a similar motherboard (slightly inferior - Epox MVP3CM,
  which has the same chipset) and this hasn't had any kernel oopses when
  shutting down.
  I've used Kernel 2.2.5-15, and 2.2.9, and the oops happens on both
  kernels. I've tried with and without the experimental VIA82c586 driver,
  and it's still the case.
Hi Menaka,
The experimental Via driver is for IDE, and doesn't do anything for
your power-off problem, which is a BIOS bug.
The reason for this oops is apparently because your BIOS expects only
to be called from real mode, and can't handle the cpu being in
protected mode. Ask Epox if they could fix this bug and release a
BIOS update. (i have the same problem with my TMC board,
unfortunately TMC can't be bothered to fix it.)
In the meantime, A guy called  Walter Hofmann has released a patch to
work-around it, to change to real-mode before calling the BIOS
power-off routine. It should apply cleanly to any recent 2.2 kernel.
regards,
