Is there currently any work on supporting the CMI8338 PCI sound chip?
This sound chip support 4ch analog out, 2 chanel 24bit S/PDIF in/out, and
various other nicities. It's ISA cousin was well supported in Linux (via
the stock SB16 drive). Probably the nicest feature of this card is it's
price: You can get these cards for $20 (with nice RCA S/PDIF output).
The page claims that it has legacy SB16 support via on board ISA DMA
emulaton (which supposdity works under real dos). I havn't gotten it
working under Linux yet, but I only spent about 5 seconds trying so far.
I'd like to see native support for it (to be able to use the full 24bit
output, and all four channels), and I'd imagine that the company should be
fairly open w/ specs.
