Look, it's really simple: lets say I make a change that has to do with
PM, you do a quick compile test with and _without_ PM just to check you
didn't screw anything up with that change. You change reiserfs acl
stuff, you do a quick compile test with and without that configured.
It's a pretty standard procedure, and contrary to what you think, it
_is_ required before submitting a patch. No one is asking anyone to
check all possible configure options, but the interesting data set is
typically extremely easy to guess looking at a change.
