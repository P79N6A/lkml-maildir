Agreed. On first glance, I was intrigued but:
1) Why is everyone so concerned that export symbol space is large?
	- does it cost cpu or running memory?
	- does it cause bugs?
	- or are you just worried about "evil modules"?
2) These aren't real namespaces
	- all global names still have to be unique
	- still have to handle the "non-modular build" namespace conflicts
	- there isn't a big problem with conflicting symbols today.
So why bother adding complexity.
