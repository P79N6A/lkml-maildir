Seto is propsing an API that solves a different problem than what
you are thinking about.
In my case, the hardware (pci controller) will shut down a pci
slot(s) in the case of a pci error (parity or otherwise).  
There's nothing that the software can do except to reset
the pci controller (and the cards underneath it).
Seto's API solves 1/2 the problem for me: it allows errors
to be detected.  The other 1/2 (to be discussed) is how
to coordinate all the affected device drivers while the
pci controller is being reset.
