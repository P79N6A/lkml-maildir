Hi,
I'm using 2.5(.73-mm3, but this also applies to earlier versions) and 
I'm getting tons (~6000/min) of "fix old protocol handler <pppoed>!" in 
my syslog on a quite loaded adsl line. For the time being I just 
commented out the annoying code fragment  and I didn't find any 
regressions yet (uptime ~20days).
So what's the correct way of getting rid of this message? I tried 
recompiling pppd and pppoe, but that doesn't solve it. Is there a 
patched version somewhere.
Thanks,
Jan
pppd version 2.4.2b3
Roaring Penguin PPPoE Version 3.5
