I hope the trip was enjoyable.

Well, I've long grumbled about it all in the silence of my soul. Just
looking at it, I'd be willing to do the odd page (I'm sure that while
each page might consume some time, if they were spread out enough I
could do a few).
The problem, of course, is: Where is the information to be had, exactly,
if neither info nor man have it? I'd cheerfully document the IPv6 API as
implemented in my currently installed libc, but of course there's
nowhere to start but guesswork..First I'd have to test to see if a
function exists (many appear to), then try to figure out how it differs
from the spec.
I guess it amounts to a lot of tedious wandering through the glibc
source...there's less time available for that. :/
