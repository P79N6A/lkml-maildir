Since we need saner layout, I would strongly suggest exactly that.

Bad description.  "Value of st_dev for files on that filesystem", please -
there might be no such thing as "the device hosting the filesystem" _and_
the value here may bloody well be unrelated to device actually holding
all data (for things like ext2meta, etc.).

I'd suggest doing a new file that would *not* try to imitate /etc/mtab.
Another thing is, how much of propagation information do we want to
be exposed and what do we intend to do with it?  Note that "entire
propagation tree" is out of question - it spans many namespaces and
contains potentially sensitive information.  So we won't see all nodes.
What do we want to *do* with the information about propagation?
