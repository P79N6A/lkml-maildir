	But cdrom_read_toc is the routine that called this in
the first place.  That would create an infinite loop.  Here, again,
is the call graph from my original email:
        Routine                 File
        cdrom_read_toc          ide/ide-cd.c
        cdrom_get_last_written  cdrom/cdrom.c
        ide_cdrom_audio_ioctl   ide/ide-cd.c
        cdrom_get_toc_entry     ide/ide-cd.c
