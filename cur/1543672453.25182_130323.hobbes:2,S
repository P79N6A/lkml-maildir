There's no need to be rude in any case, particularly after the OP reposted
a not tainted oops which had been through ksymoops and didn't get any help
anyway. Why be nasty about the format of a question you're not answering
even after it's been asked again in the preferred format?
It's a shame that some people seem to think that lots of hard work
entitles them to be rude and condescending, while really important
contributors like Alan Cox, Ingo and akpm can be polite and helpful, even
when they are correcting someone or disagreeing on an approach to a
problem.
