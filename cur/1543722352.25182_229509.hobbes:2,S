Interesting stuff. FYI we did some analysis of the hottest addresses in
the kernel and profile_lock featured very high up:
void profile_hook(struct pt_regs * regs)
{
        read_lock(&profile_lock);
        notifier_call_chain(&profile_listeners, 0, regs);
        read_unlock(&profile_lock);
}
Thats 2 atomic operations to the same cacheline per timer interrupt per
cpu. Considering how rarely timer based profiling is used, perhaps RCU
or even just a profiling_enabled sysctl flag would help here. Id prefer
not to compile it out in distro kernels if possible, its a very useful
feature when required.
In the mean time, how about this quick fix?
Anton

Cacheline align profile_lock, analysis shows it to be one of the hottest
memory locations on large SMP boxes.
