I think you've got some other issue if simple I/O errors cause issues.
I've managed hundreds of MD arrays over the past ~ten years.  MD is
rock solid.  I'd guess that I've recovered at least a hundred disk failures
where data was saved by mdadm.
What is your setup like?  It's also possible that you've found a bug.

Are you sure?  The one thing that's not always intuitive about MD - a
faild array often still has your data and you can recover it.  Unlike
hardware RAID solutions, you have a lot of control over how the disks
are assembled and used - this can be a major advantage.
I'd say once a week someone comes on the linux-raid list and says "Oh no!
I accidently ruined my RAID array!".  Neil almost always responds "Well,
don't do that!  But since you did, this might help...".
