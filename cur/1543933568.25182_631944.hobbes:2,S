Ok, time to CC security team, I'd say.
Problem is, that some AMD64x2 nVidia laptops crash on port 0x80
access... which is easily user-triggerable by using /dev/rtc. If it is
644 on Fedora, I guess we have a problem.
Otoh, it is "only" a denial of service, and it can probably be
attributed to "buggy hardware". Is that still relevant for security team?
