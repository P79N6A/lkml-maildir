And it does get caught on that in small memory machines.  This
deadlock is easily reproducable on a 32MB UML instance.  I haven't yet
tested with the per-bdi patches, but I don't think they make a
difference in this case.

I think nr_dirty is totally irrelevant.  Since we don't care about
case 1), and in case 2) nr_dirty doesn't play any role.

Why?

Sure, if we do need to globally limit the number of under-writeback
pages, then I think we need to do it independently of the dirty
accounting.
