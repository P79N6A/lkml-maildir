Lest anyone think me completely clueless, yes, I'm well aware of that.  It's
just that I wanted to have that warm fuzzy feeling the comes from pretending I
had the cash to buy a dual processor machine when I bought this PC.
I had planned too, but my laptop died and I needed a new box in a hurry so I had
to get what I could get.  It's a decent motherboard though, for being single
processor.
On the other hand, I did identify that you can't power off with smp enabled
unless (as someone helpfully posted) you give this parameter in lilo or grub:
apm=power-off
While the SMP config option says APM doesn't work if you have SMP enabled (so I
should have known), it would be helpful to mention that you can still power off
this way.
