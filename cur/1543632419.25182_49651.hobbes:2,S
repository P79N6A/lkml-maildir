FUD? Heh. No, it's a simple question and you haven't answered it.

Read below. I don't have much time to waste on this topic, so I'll be 
brief.

And that's precisely the wrong way to break it up. You'll waste your time
and you'll probably hit Linus' bit bucket in no time. Thank you very much,
but I can split patches based on the files they touch by myself, I don't
need your help.
What you and other very vocal proponents of kbuild25 don't understand is 
that you need break it up __functionally__. That is, add one feature at a 
time. That way, good features can be added without much of a discussion, 
and debatable features can be, well, debated.
Unfortunately, I don't see Keith doing this anytime soon. He's too much in 
love with his baby to risk seeing parts of it being thrown away, so he's 
taking an all-or-nothing attitude.
Fortunately, it is precisely what Kai is doing. He deserves a big THANKS 
for doing it, not your silly bashing. I also saw some good work on this 
from Sam Ravnborg on the list.
Anyway, EOT for me.
