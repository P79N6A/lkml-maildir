I'm working on doing that right now. I was starting on it with the plugins 
patches a few weeks ago, and intended to follow it up pretty quickly with the 
rest. Unfortunately I've gotten sidetracked and overwhelmed by email :) and a 
lot of other things, so it's taking a lot longer than I wanted. 
Never-the-less, I'm working towards precisely this.
Regards,
Nigel
