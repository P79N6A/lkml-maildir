make defconfig compiled no issues (changed to pentium classic for the local 
box); installed and fired it up. i then compiled the kernel again (with a 
few changes) running under 2.5.56 and compiled RH-2.4.18-3 at the same time 
to stress. no issues. pentium classic + 128M + 1G IDE w/ext3. im turning on 
all debug features and trying again tonight with a few modules. if 
something breaks ill post again.
