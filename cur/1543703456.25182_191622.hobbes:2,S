Some drivers are being re-written for 2.6++. The following
construct seems to work for "waiting for an event" in
the kernel modules.
        // No locks are being held
        tim = jiffies + EVENT_TIMEOUT;
        while(!event() && time_before(jiffies, tim))
            schedule_timeout(0);
Is there anything wrong?
Do I have to execute "set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)" before?
Do I have to execute "set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING)" after?
I don't want to have to change this again so I really need to
know. For instance, if I execute "set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)"
in version 2.4.24, it didn't hurt anything. In 2.6.1, there are
conditions where schedule_timeout(0) doesn't return if another
task is spinning "while(1) ; ". This is NotGood(tm).
Cheers,
