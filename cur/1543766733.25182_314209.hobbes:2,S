One has to be careful when talking about enabling/disable IRQs, because 
there are (at least) two choke points: one on the device and one on the 
computer's interrupt controller.  Masking IRQs takes place on the 
controller, but I was talking about stopping interrupt requests at their 
source on the device.  It's the only way to avoid problems when IRQ lines 
are shared.
