Subject: alloc_page_vma: should be called from a module? (not exported in x86_64)

Hi,
We've developed a driver for an image acquisition card, which maps
kernel alloc'ed buffers into user space vma's. We use alloc_page +
remap_pfn_range in the driver mmap file_operation.
After looking at alloc_page_vma, I thought that it might be more
appropiate than alloc_page in this context. However, if CONFIG_NUMA=y
(x86_64), this function is not visible to modules.
Is this limitation intentional?
We alloc RAM in a page-by-page basis. Is vm_insert_page more
appropiate than remap_pfn_range?
Thanks a lot for your help.
Alejandro
