I suggest to model the implementation after the timer code which does
exactly what we need.

Why should any verification be necessary?  The requests are generated in
the same process which will receive the notification.  Even if the POSIX
process (aka, kernel process group) changes the IDs the notifications
should be set.  The key is that notifications cannot be sent to another
POSIX process.
Adding this as a feature just makes things so much more complicated.

OK, this seems OK.  We have to construct the iocb arrays dynamically anyway.

If you have room for the parameter this is fine.  For the beginning we
can enforce the number to be the same as the total number of requests.

It should be fine and I would support adding all this assuming the
normal file support (as opposed to direct I/O only) is added, too.
But I have one last question: sockets, pipes and the like are already
supported, right?  If this is not the case we have a problem with the
currently proposed  lio_listio interface.
