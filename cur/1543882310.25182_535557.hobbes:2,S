Not that simple. For non shared interrupts it is straight forward, but
for shared ones we have to decide, whether we 
A) reject the request
B) disable the interrupt and rely on the caller, that it reenables it
C) ignore it
sorted by ugliness order :)
A) is definitely the most safe bet, but B) might work as well.
