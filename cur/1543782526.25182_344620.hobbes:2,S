   I don't know that it's that uncommon.  Simply having one non-arch
specific timer is enough to need to decided whether it's better than a
generic timer.  I assume pretty much every arch has a cycle timer.  For
smaller boxes, this might be the preferred timer given it's latency even
if something like an hpet exists (mmio access are expensive).  How do
you hard code a value that can account for that?  I agree, we could
easily go too far and produce some bloated algorithm, but maybe it's
simply a weighted product of a few variables.
To start with, what would this do:
(frequency) * (1/drift) * (1/latency) * (1/(jitter_factor * cpus))
Something this simple at least starts to dynamically bring the factors
together.  All else being equal (and with no weighting), this would give
the 1.5GHz/750ppm timer a higher priority than the 250MHz/500ppm timer.
Is that good?  I like your idea to make this user tunable after boot,
but I still think there has to be a way to make a smarter decision up
front.  Thanks,
	Alex
