Well, the problems with that is that lustre still evolves pretty quickly,
but once it is in kernel, it is sort of set in stone, no more easy changes
to the wire protocol, no more big internal changes (fast)...

Well, there is not all that much "dead" code introduced (I hope). Esp. if some
of the new intent code will be used by NFS, for example.
And it is not all that dead too, there would be at least one off-tree user ;)
