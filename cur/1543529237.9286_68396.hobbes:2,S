Your guess is about right.  A SIGSTOP is sent during the PTRACE_ATTACH
		send_sig(SIGSTOP, child, 1);
and will complete (shortly) thereafter.

The parent has to do a wait4 to wait for the child to stop.  (You could also
observe the stop by watching /proc/n/status, etc, but this isn't really
practical.)
