I was under the impression the random number generator is one of the features
of the up coming (or ever delaying) 820 chipsets not of the CPU itself.

The Linux /dev/random is effectively a hardware RNG. It uses entropy data
from keyboard timings and other interrupts that depend on your typing 
timing, the disk timings etc
