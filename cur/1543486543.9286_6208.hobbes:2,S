unless your system isn't alive anymore.  then, using those timestamps you'd 
at least approximately know when it crashed (e.g. when it happened during night).
this can be important when trying to corelate crashes with `external events'
(power outage, hacker attack, room cleaning company working, ...;)
whatever additional informations I can get when trying to analyze crashes,
I appreciate them!

no need to change the sources -- just start syslogd with convenient options;)
