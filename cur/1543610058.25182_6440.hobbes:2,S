You can increase the reserved free memory (not sure where to do this in
2.4.x). This is important, cause network memory requests are usually within
interrupt handlers and therefore no paging can occur. You can play a bit
with the memory settings in net/*_mem. Most important you can configure the
kernel for large window sizes and advanced routing.

Increasing rx/rx rings is not a particular good idea cause it slows down
TCPs adaption to network congestion and router overload.
