Yep...

5" 720k disks can be had with /dev/fd?h720 without problem. 5" 1440k
disks are not one of the standard formats supported by Linux...
Incidentally, my understanding as to why these work when using
/dev/fd0 doesnae is because the suffixed versions over-ride the
drive's own details and return their own...

True, but irrelevant...

Please advise re your findings...

Probably because those two are NOT compatible with each other. Try
using the compatible options, which have been working fine for me for
OVER TWO YEARS...and if they're not working for you, then either
you've patched the kernel to prevent them from doing so, somebody else
has done so, or the relevant entries in /dev have the wrong mknod
numbers attached to them...
For reference, your second line should refer to
 Q> /dev/fd1d360
 Q>         ^
As I understand it, /dev/fd1h360 refers to a drive formatted as SINGLE
sided, 80 tracks, 9 sectors per track, but I have never found a drive
where it could be used...
Best wishes from Riley.
