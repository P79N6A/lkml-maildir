Now on Alpha I don't assume it anymore and the allocation has no way for
mistakes (looks robust to me).

I know the door for mistakes was small but as it's almost closed (thanks
to the bootmem allocator) now I closed it completly on Alpha making sure
to allocate the bootmap in RAM. So as far as the kernel gets loaded in RAM
from the bootloader no one weird mm configuration should be allowed
to break at boot.
The real point is that there's no downside is being smart as all goes in
the init sections.
