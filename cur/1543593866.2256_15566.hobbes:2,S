It could be using the YUV digital inputs to the ATI chip. It seems however
also quite likely to me that windows is doing the following
1.	Issuing USB transfers which put the data into video ram overlay buffers
	(ie the DMA from the USB controller)
2.	Using the YUV overlay/expand hardware in the ATI card 
	(see www.gatos.org for X stuff for ATI for this)
