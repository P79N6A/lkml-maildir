Yes, that is exactly what I was trying to say in my comment above.
Sorry for the confusion, and thanks for clearing it up Muli.
The dma_unmap_single call is the only dma_XXX type call in the gart
code.  All other calls use the gart_XXX equivalent.  It seems to me that
this was an oversight.  Also, the dma_XXX type calls go through a
wrapper in asm/dma-mapping.h, which translates this call to the gart
equivalent.  It also makes the code 8 bytes smaller :)
Thanks,
Jon
