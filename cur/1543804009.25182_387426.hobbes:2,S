OK, it's not wrong I guess - we're running code which requires
local_irq_disable() and that code is calling functions which do
local_irq_enable() but we know that those functions won't do that because
there cannot be any lock contention.
So it works, and will continue to work, but it's all rather unpleasant, IMO.

I think the powerpc code is busted, really - it shouldn't be keeling over
like that if someone enables local interrupts.  That being said, it's a
good way of detecting accidental interrupt-enablings.

Yup.  Perhaps a sane fix which preserves the unpleasant semantics is to do
irqsave in the mutex debug code.
