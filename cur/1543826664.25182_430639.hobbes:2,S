I still think it's important that we actually do disable devices before
entering D3.  Currently there isn't a driver that does.

Alright, trying again then. :)
PCI PM: generic suspend/resume fixes
Some drivers never call pci_enable_device() or pci_enable_master() and
instead assume the bios will have initialized the device.  As a
workaround, this patch modifies the generic resume function to verify
which device features need to be enabled by checking the previous state
of the COMMAND register.
