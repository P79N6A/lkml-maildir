As far as naming is concerned, gcc effectively supports four levels,
which *currently* map onto macros as follows:
__always_inline		Inline unconditionally
inline			Inlining hint
<nothing>		Standard heuristics
noinline		Uninline unconditionally
A lot of noise is being made about the naming of the levels (and I
personally believe we should have a different annotation for "inline
unconditionally for correctness" and "inline unconditionally for
performance", as a documentation issue), but those are the four we get.
