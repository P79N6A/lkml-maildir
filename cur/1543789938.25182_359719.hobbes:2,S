Will cmd_per_lun, sg_tablesize, max_sectors, dma_boundary, 
use_clustering ever have to be adjusted specifically for a SAS hardware?
Obviuosly none of this is required _at the moment_. IOW neither the 
introduction of a sas_ha_hw_profile nor a pass-through of 
scsi_host_template down to SAS interconnect drivers is required right 
now. So why do one or the other now? Isn't it a sensible rule to not 
solve problems now which do not exist yet?
(I guess Luben only introduced sas_ha_hw_profile to demonstrate that 
there will never be an absolute requirement for scsi_host_template --- 
in its present form --- to be visible in a SAS transport layer <-> SAS 
interconnect driver interface. And there are certainly more alternatives 
to these two approaches.)
