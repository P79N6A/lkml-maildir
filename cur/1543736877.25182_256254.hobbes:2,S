 prefixing a new root onto the front of the file name and then
 re-issuing (proxying) a request.
 all file requests, all stats, all opendirs, everything.

 p.s.  if someone fixes the ioctl bug BLKRRDPART on a usb scsi
	   storage device which has been umounted with a "-l"
	   option, then i don't have to do all this work.
