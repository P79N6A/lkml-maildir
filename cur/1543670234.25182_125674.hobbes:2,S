	The problem should be the same. This 'lock bh + GFP_KERNEL'
BUG happens only when slab allocates pages, not on each kmalloc.

	This should not happen, may be you see another place that violates
the above rule? IMO, the only problem is that it is not good to
hold locks (including bh one) while using GFP_KERNEL.
