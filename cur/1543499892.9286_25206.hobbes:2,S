what 
 Thud. thud. thud.
 Linux filesystems have label strings, even the DOS fs's have serial
numbers
oops, i should have said the /kernel/ has no concept of fs labels. The
tools do, and is probably where labelling belongs. but this issue is
transparent to devfs, as are many others. (not that i'm trying to drum
anything in..)  :)
