Any time you follow the directions of one userspace program,
you can screw up others.  I suspect that userspace has far
less of a chance of getting it right than the kernel.
ALSA would be a good example of why it is bad to export
tuning knobs directly to userspace - many sound cards have
non-standard names for the volume controls, making it almost
impossible for userspace to present the user with a simple
user interface for tweaking the volume.

Lets turn this around.
The user has been accessing the kernel tree over and over
again, for hours on end (compile testing a patch).  Along
comes a backup program, that tells you to evict the whole
thing from the cache.
What do you do?
How can you make global policy decisions based on the intent
of one program?
Only the kernel knows the state of the whole system and has
observed the behaviour of all the processes. One process has
no idea what the other processes in the system are doing.
