Ok, Mike also expressed the feeling that it was no longer necessary to
handle the first block separatly.  I've tested the attached patch on the
machines I have to hand and it seems to boot just fine in the flat
memory modes with this applied.
Joel, Mike, Dave could you test this one on your platforms to confirm
its widly applicable, if so we can push it up to -mm.  The patch
attached applies to the patches proposed for the next -mm.  A full stack
on top of 2.6.12-rc3-mm2 can be found at the URL below (see the series
file):

Cheers.

Testing seems to confirm that we do not need to handle the first memory
block specially in do_init_bootmem.
