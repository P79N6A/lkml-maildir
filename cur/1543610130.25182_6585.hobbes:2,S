Hi,
Is anyone still working on making the Linux Kernel Multiboot compliant ?
I wan't to load my modules from grub(pxegrub) without the need to compile in 
ramdisk / initrd / romfs... (System memory is very low (4MB-6MB)).
I have found some Postings in the Mailing list archive, but they aren't quit 
clear what has happend to this idear.
Mfg. Christian König.
