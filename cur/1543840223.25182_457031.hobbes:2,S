Subject: [PATCH 000 of 11] knfsd: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/24/27

Following are 11 patch for knfsd against
 2.6.18-rc4-mm2 plus  nfsd-lockdep-annotation.patch
 (the first patch being a fix for that patch).
They are all appropriate for 2.6.19, not 2.6.18.
The batch in the middle (6-9) allow nfsd to handle IO requests
of up to 1Megabyte (rather than the current limit of 32K).
This only applies on TCP connections.  This has not 
been heavily tested...
The max size to allow is configurable via the nfsd filesystem,
and defaults to something that I hope is reasonable.
This set also includes a few more scalability patches from Greg Banks.
