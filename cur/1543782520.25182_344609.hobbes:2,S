your patch works great here, on 3 separate systems: a 1-way, a 2/4-way 
and an 8-way.
the 1-way system performed so well running the SMP kernel that i first 
thought i booted the UP kernel by accident :-)
on the 8-way box, "hackbench 10" got _3.7_ times faster (!!!).
i have booted the 8-way box without your patch once more because i didnt 
believe the results initially and thought they were some benchmarking 
fluke. But no, it wasnt a fluke. The kernel profiles are nicely flat 
now.
i've released 2.6.13-rc7-rt2 with your patch included. This is certainly 
a major milestone for PREEMPT_RT, it is now a first-class scalability 
citizen on SMP too. Great work Steven!
