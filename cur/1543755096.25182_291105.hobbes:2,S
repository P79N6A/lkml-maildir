Unbind/give does not address what VGA control needs. VGA control needs
to track hotplug remove events so that it can route the display to
another VGA card if the active display is pulled. As far as I can tell
there is no way to monitor hotplug remove events, that's why I had to
add a callout in pci_destroy_dev().
VGA control also can't just install a device driver since that will
prevent the real DRM/FB device drivers from installing. It looks to me
like VGA control is more of a strange property of the PCI bus
architecture than a device driver.
Another strategy would be to create the concept of a PCI class driver
which a normal device driver would inherit from instead of replacing
it. But is there a need for another PCI class driver other than VGA?
