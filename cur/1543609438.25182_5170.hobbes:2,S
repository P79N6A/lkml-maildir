so "current" was _always_ "keventd" every time you press SYSRQ+P? sounds
like you deadlocked in keventd then.

scheduling the tasklet without it being enabled is perfect, there's no
problem at all if the scheduler is functional by the time
spwan_ksoftirqd is executed.
All issues mentioned so far about the softirq should only to deal with
performance, not with deadlocking. If it deadlocks that's a sparc32 bug,
messing the softirq code can only hide the real bug.

As we said several times so far, tasklets should remain disabled only
for a little time during production (aka during the benchmarks), and
it's a matter of the user to tasklet_kill only enabled tasklets (it's
like quitting a function without a local_irq_restore, no surprise if irq
remains stuck if you forget to reenable irq/tasklets).
As Linus said tasklet_disable is the same thing of __cli() (or if you
prefer as Alexey said, it's like local_bh_disable()), you shouldn't __cli()
or local_bh_disable() for a long time, it's worthless to optimize for
very long critical sections, tasklet_disable is just to serialize within
a critical section. The boot case doesn't matter either, it doesn't
matter if at boot we waste a couple of cpu cycles, boot time won't
change anyways because of that (boot time is all cpu idle time waiting
those scsi things).
But again, those softirq issues are only performance issues, they cannot
explain a deadlock in spwan_ksoftirqd, that is a sparc32 bug, period.
So please fix the bug, then we can discuss the rest, but whatever we
change it won't be for the boot process, the only thing that matters is
production, even if ksoftirqd loops for seconds during the boot process
it doesn't matter at all.
