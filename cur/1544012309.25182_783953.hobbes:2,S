| We already have for_each_irq_nr() for this purpose ;-)
Which is not shorter form of desc iterator in turn :-)
Since the original for_each_irq_desc didn't check for NULL
desc's I think the better would to name it like for_each_irq_desc_safe
or for_each_irq_desc_inuse then.
Nevermind, Kosaki, since it's only me who is confused I should
just shut up :-)
