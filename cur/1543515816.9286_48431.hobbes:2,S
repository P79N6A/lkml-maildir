Hi Michael,
  we had this problems with ncpfs, but we hope that it is fixed now (in 2.3
tree). We now build complete dentries and inodes not only in lookup, but in
readdir too (we can do this as NCP directory scan function can return
all important inode data). We set dentry's d_fsdata to position in directory
and as this field is revalidated only if directory is reread, it will
work for 'rm -rf' too (it is NOT revalidated/invalidated on unlink/rmdir).
  There are two open problems now (probably never fixed):
1) if you remove 'current' readdir entry by unlink, netware then refuses
your 'current' position and returns 'end of directory' (rm prematurely
stops). It is not problem with glibc (2.1), as it always overestimates 
buffer size (i.e. it has to seek back on next getdents call) and never 
returns last entry to caller program. It could be problem with libc5, but 
I never saw this without using specific tools written just for 
exploiting it.
2) if you do 'rm -f dir' together with 'while true; do ls dir; done',
'ls' can (and will) cause renumbering of directory entries.
                                                    Best regards,
                                                        Petr Vandrovec
