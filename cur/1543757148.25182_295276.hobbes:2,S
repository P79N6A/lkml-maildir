Why have that "tty->icanon && !tty->canon_data" test in the first place, I 
wonder?  Isn't the "left" calculation always correct? That's really how 
many bytes free we have in the tty, that "canon_data" thing is just about 
how much of it is available for _reading_ as canon, no? (Ie "how many 
characters that have seen a finishing end-of-line"). So I don't see why 
that canon_data test is relevant to the question of filling the buffer.. 
In particular, afaikt, "canon_data" can be zero even if we _have_ 
characters in the queue (just not aany EOLN), so I'd expect your version 
to still return "N_TTY_BUF_SIZE-1" even though the queue can only actually 
take fewer characters..
So I'd still worry whether that added -1 actually fixes the bug, or just 
means that a off-by-one has to now be off-by-two to be noticeable.. (In 
contrast, changing the chunking to 2kB not only changes a "off-by-one" to 
a "off-by-2048", but more importantly is what we've tested for the last 
decade or so ;)
In fact, I _think_ that the whole 
	if (tty->icanon && !tty->canon_data)
test is about the fact that we _want_ the writer to start dropping 
characters at some point, since if we're in canon mode, we need to get a 
full line in the end, and if there is no EOLN to be had, then we _need_ to 
drop characters.
So I'd think that the n_tty_receive_room() function should look something 
like this:
	static int n_tty_receive_room(struct tty_struct *tty)
	{
		int left = N_TTY_BUF_SIZE - tty->read_cnt - 1;
		if (left <= 0)
			left = tty->icanon && !tty->canon_data;
		return left;
	}
which basically says: only accept as much data as we can fit in the
buffer, BUT if we can't really fit anything and we're in canon mode (but
haven't seen a newline yet), we need to allow the writer to continut to
trickle data (that we will discard) in the hopes of _eventually_ seeing an
EOLN.
Does that make sense to you? Maybe the "input full, but no canon_data" 
special case would be better handled in the read path, rather than the 
write path?
