If you ask any gcc folks, the main reason they think this was a really
stupid thing to do was exactly that the 2.96 thing is incompatible BOTH
with the 2.95.x release _and_ the upcoming 3.0 release.
Nobody asked the people who knew this, apparently.

gcc-2.95.2 is at least a real release, from a branch that is actively
maintained - so a 2.95.3 is likely to happen reasonably soon, fixing as
many problems as possible _without_ being incompatible like the snapshots
are.
Or just stay at 2.91.66 (egcs).
As to X compile problems - neither egcs nor 2.95.2 appears to have any
trouble with the CVS tree. Possibly because they got fixed, because, after
all, at least those were real releases.
I'd applaud RedHat for making snapshots available, but they should be
marked as SNAPSHOTS, and not as the main compiler with no way to fix the
damn problems it causes.
As it is, anybody doing development is probably better off at RH-6.2.
That is doubly true if they intend to release binaries.
