Subject: isa_read/write not available on ppc - solution suggestions ??

To get the pcmcia ibmtr driver (ibmtr/ibmtr_cs) working on ppc, all the 
isa_read/write's have to be changed to regular read/write due to the lack 
of the isa_read/write functions for ppc.
So, the question is should I simply:
a) change everything to read/write and friends (the way the driver used to 
be before the isa_read/write function were introduced)
b) Put ugly macros in the driver to use the different functions depending 
upon architecture.
c) Implement the isa_read/write functions for ppc ? 
or d) something completely different I haven't thought of. 
Remember, this driver must support isa, pcmcia, mca, ix86 and now ppc. 
Personally I'd rather not have arch dependent macros in the driver, but I 
know there is a good reason why the isa_read/write functions were 
introduced in the first place. 
Suggestions ?
