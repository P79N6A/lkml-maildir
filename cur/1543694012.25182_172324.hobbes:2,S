I agree with you that st_blocksize should very probably be different (in 
_no_ case has it got anything to do with just "wtmult", since the thing 
is used for reading too). However, the st_blocks calculations has 
_nothing_ to do with st_blocksize.
st_blocksize is "this is the preferred blocking for IO".
st_blocks is "this is how many 512-byte blocks the file has".
The names may be similar, but they have nothing in common. They are in
totally different namespaces - one is in bytes, the other one in units of
"traditional UNIX block size", aka sector, aka 512 bytes. Trying to mix 
the two is doomed.
