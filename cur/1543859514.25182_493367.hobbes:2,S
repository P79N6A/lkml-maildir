XFS appears to call clear_page_dirty to get the mapping tree dirty
tag set correctly at the same time the page dirty flag is cleared. I
note that this can be done by set_page_writeback() if we clear the
dirty flag on the page first when we are writing back the entire page.
Hence it seems to me that the XFS call to clear_page_dirty() could
easily be substituted by clear_page_dirty_for_io() followed by a
call to set_page_writeback() to get the mapping tree tags set
correctly after the page has been marked clean.
Does this make sense (even without the posted patch)?
