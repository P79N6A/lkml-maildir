How on earth can you copy the file without overwriting the target /dev/null?
As you saw, I could just "cat" the file. Size was:
root:sleipner:~# dd if=/dev/zero of=sparse bs=1M seek=5000 count=1
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
root:sleipner:~# ls -l sparse 
1040 -rw-r--r--  1 root root 5243928576 Jun  8 10:26 sparse
5.2 fake GBs...
