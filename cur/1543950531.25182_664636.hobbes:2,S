The old stack also works. I forgot to mention that with the new
stack (not with the old) there is a message when going to sleep:
firewire_ohci: pci_set_power_state failed with -5
but it is harmless, and if I understand correctly due to the 
fact that the power management on this chip is not implemented 
through capability fields in the PCI configuration space.
