Hi,
what i did is:
$ find /some/nfs/volume -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat > /dev/null &
$ find /some/nfs/volume -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat > /dev/null &
$ find /some/nfs/volume -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat > /dev/null &
$ find /some/nfs/volume -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat > /dev/null &
$ wait
and on other xterm:
~/some-kernel$ make dep bzImage modules -j2
and another one:
~/some-kernel$ make dep bzImage modules
kernels finished, i've pressed Ctrl-C on the console with wait
(i wanted check interactivity, and was pretty amazed).
Started QPS(a tool like gtop) just to see two of the find's
are still there. Zombies, yes, sleeping in exit().
Closing the console removed the zombies. That's stock bash-2.05a,
and it hadn't such problems before (although i'm going to try to
reproduce that situation in exactly same way under 2.4.18-pre8-K2
todays night).
