Only the mapping from block-nr to uid/gid/perms needs to be in the kernel.
The rest can be done in userspace, but it would be ugly as hell.

ACK.

If you want to allow users to set their default shell using some extension,
a simple userspace library will not do the job. You'll need a central
authority that is able to synchronize the access to the file, prevent
unauthorized modifications, do the caching etc.
I think the special file handlers should generally be daemons, but the
access should be controlled by kernel hooks, maybe something like
automounting a userspace filesystem. Simple meta-filesystems, e.g. those
that could be "emulated" using mount -oloop, may reside in the kernel
space, more complicated but common ones may be stored in the kernel
(placed on the initramfs?) to accelerate starting the helper daemon and
uncommon ones would be registered at runtime (maybe user-specific).
Having functions in the kernel to support those filesystems in the kernel
will help, e.g. a tgz helper daemon would need to allocate temporary
storage for accelerating access (e.g. file tree, cache) as well as means
to reassemble the tgz for operations on the whole file after write
operations occured. Meta-filesystems on fs without these features can
(off cause) be done, but I think they would be very slow or show
inconsitencies in certain situations.
