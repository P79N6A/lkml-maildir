I'm running a KT400 based board (MSI KT4 Ultra) with a GeForce 4 Ti4200 (agp 
4x) on a custom compiled Mandrake 2.4.21 kernel.
I regularly play games such as Unreal Tournament / UT 2003 and Neverwinter 
Nights and I have to say that stability and performance is excelent.
I'm running Mandrake 9.0 which includes X 4.2.1, along with the latest nVidia 
binary drivers.
I certainly don't see any of the kind of application/X crash you are 
reporting. In fact, I've played NWN for most of a day with nothing going 
wrong that can't be attributed to the beta status of the game (the game 
doesn't crash, I just get some graphical glitches which are fixed by 
reloading a saved game).
If I can be of any more assistance, shout.
Mark Watts.
