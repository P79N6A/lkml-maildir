Permanent. Re-merging (or rather call it UN-COWING ;) is not
considered necesary.

No, because by default all allocations are marked as private for each
process. The fact is, the original UNIX did not do COW, but did copy
the whole process memory and handed this copy to the child process.

If you want to share a mapping, the easiest way is to:
1. Create a temp file on /tmp with the size you need.
2. mmap the file, which will get the file contents into your
addressing space. Remeber to ask for shared mapping.
3. Fork.
4. Now both processes have an mmaped file with shared mapping.
Anything written by one is seen by the other, since they use the same
backing space. The contents are also visible by doing a cat on the
shared temporary file (this is great for debugging :).
You may not want to keep the file around. You can delete the file just
after having opened it, so that it's not visible on the filesystem. It
will just keep using the space until you exit all processes which were
using the file.
