I do not know how small a tidbit this will be, but together with these
processes stuck in state "D", there is a continuing rise in the load
averages of the system as reported by various interfaces
(top/uptime/w/phpSysInfo). On the system running 2.4.18-xfs this rose to
up to 25 before I eventually rebooted the box.
Another bit: on the 2.4.18-xfs box, the number of processes getting
stuck in state "D" kept growing. Various `ps ax` and `sync` processes in
particular, would get stuck and stall as I would issue them. It may be
interesting to note that with 2.4.19-rc2-xfs, with which I had my "latest
encounter" with this problem, no `ps ax` or `sync` processes got stuck.
Only the couple of apt-method processes that got stuck (and any new ones
I would launch in an attempt to download a package from the Internet for
installation) were there.
Both units have already been upgraded to 2.4.19-rc3-xfs. I will send
feedback if/when I run into any processes stuck in state "D" for
abnormally long periods of time.
