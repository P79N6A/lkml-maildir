Right, and instead of this you are now claiming that these `benchmarks'
show superior reiser4 performance. Moreover, you are doing this
aggressively and proposing other people to `eat the dust' over what
happened to only exist due to your failing to remember something. As
some other notable LKML poster put it `inform yourself before
posting'. :-)

It wasn't Zam. It was me to begin with. OVERWRITE and MODIFY phases were
turned off after switching to large keys.

What fairness and kindness one expects after styling others as `puppies'
in public, and commenting on their hair style in purportedly technical
argument?
