I recently upgraded a server running vtund 2.4 (4/18/01) to stock 2.4.6
kernel.  It seems the changes to the tun driver have broken vtund.  Now my
syslog gets filled with the following messages when a client attempts to
connect:
Jul  5 10:15:53 mackman vtund[4011]: Session
mackman-vpn[64.169.117.25:2359] opened
Jul  5 10:15:53 mackman vtund[4011]: Can't allocate tun device. File
descriptor in bad state(77)
Jul  5 10:15:53 mackman vtund[4011]: Session mackman-vpn closed
Jul  5 10:16:04 mackman vtund[4014]: Session
mackman-vpn[64.169.117.25:2360] opened
Jul  5 10:16:04 mackman vtund[4014]: Can't allocate tun device. File
descriptor in bad state(77)
Jul  5 10:16:04 mackman vtund[4014]: Session mackman-vpn closed
Eventually the client gives up.  Do you have any suggestions or know of
any fixes?
Thanks, Ryan Mack
