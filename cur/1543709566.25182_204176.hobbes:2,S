| Hi,
| 
| as I found out, it's impossible to use the build-chain tool scripts/modpost
| of the 2.6 kernel series to externally build modules from a directory that
| contains the character sequence '.o'. Weird things happen if you try to do
| so.
| 
| With a directory structure like on my system here, building the current DVB
| driver in '/home/daniel/cvs.linuxtv.org/dvb-kernel/build-2.6i/' generates a 
| file called '/home/daniel/cvs.linuxtv.mod.c' since modpost cuts every 
| filename string at the first occurence of '.o', not only the 'trailing .o',
| as the comment says.
The comment and code certainly don't match, and your patch makes sense
to me.  However, I can't reproduce the problem that you describe.
I built the kernel image and modules in "www.osdl.org/264rc2/build1",
and all *.mod.c and *.ko ended up there with no problems.
Then I modified modpost.c (from 2.6.4-rc1, without your patch) to
print the "stripped" module names (without the trailing ".o")
and saw a list like this:
modpost: stripped mod.name=[fs/jfs/jfs]
so where are the parent directory names that are causing problems
for you coming from?
Andrew, I applied the patch and didn't have any problems with
'make allyesconfig' like you alluded to.
