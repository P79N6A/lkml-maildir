This is definitely worth testing, but the exact schenario I outlined is 
probably not the thing that happens. It was really meant to be more of an 
exmple of the _kind_ of situation I think we might have.
That would explain why we didn't see this before: we simply didn't mark 
pages clean all that aggressively, and an app like rtorrent would normally 
have caused its flushes to happen _synchronously_ by using msync() (even 
if the IO itself was done asynchronously, all the dirty bit stuff would be 
synchronous wrt any rtorrent behaviour).
And the things that /did/ use to clean pages asynchronously (VM scanning) 
would always actually look at the "young" bit (aka "accessed") and not 
even touch the dirty bit if an application had accessed the page recently, 
so that basically avoided any likely races, because we'd touch the dirty 
bit ONLY if the page was "cold".
So this is why I'm saying that it might be an old bug, and it would be 
just the new pattern of handling dirty bits that triggers it.
But avoiding buffer heads and testing that part is worth doing. Just to 
remove one thing from the equation.
