The usual answer is "showkeys" for keycodes, "showkeys -s"
for scancodes. On 2.6 some cheating is involved, since the
driver first translates and then untranslates, so raw mode
is not exactly raw anymore, and replies may be wrong.
For the backslash/pipe key you expect scancode 0x2b
(in the default, translated scancode Set 2) and keycode 43.
X uses its own keycodes, maybe it will be 51, haven't checked.
