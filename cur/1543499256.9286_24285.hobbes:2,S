Hi,
is anybody writing - or planning to write - a driver for these
ADC boards?  I know that drivers for similar boards already exist
(see 
ftp://fb9nt.uni-duisburg.de/pub/linux/das1600/
).
I'd like to write it myself but I don't have currently one of these
boards available, and probably no time for the next three months.
So, if someone has such a board and wants to do it, I've been told
that the board docs are available.
Having such a driver available would make it possible to replace
some more WinCrap boxes by Linux...
