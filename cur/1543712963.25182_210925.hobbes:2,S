I think we all agree that the reason that we need Hari's change
is that the underlying cpu shutdown code is not clearing out all
references to the cpu from the VM system; and that in an ideal
world we should fix that.  But this is v2.6 and we need something
which fixes the issue.  Hari's patch is a very good starting point,
as it closes the window to almost nothing.  But there is still a
small window in which we can end up hung during shutdown if the
timing is wrong as cpu_online_map can change whilst we are in
the process of sending an IPI.  I think we also agree that we
don't want to add any additional active locking to VM hot path
for the remote tlb invalidate if at all possible.
In a previous email I outlined a possible solution in which we
change shutdown to guarentee that if you are in the middle of
sending an IPI all cpus online at the start of that IPI will
respond, even if they are in the process of going offline.
Below is a patch to 2.6.5-rc3 which implements this idea, subtly
modifying Hari's solution and incorporating Martins changes.
I have added copious comments as we are essentially open-coding
RCU semantics.
I have only tested this on i386 and only shutdown (!) tested it.
If there is anyone who can reliably reproduce this issue could
try this patch I would appreciate it.
Review/Comments always appreciated.
