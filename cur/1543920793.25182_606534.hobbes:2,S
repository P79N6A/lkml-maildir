Hrnf, you are not the only one.

This would be a good reason to limit what can be a notification event, yes,
since it will increase the size of every input device.

Everything capable of EV_foo would be able to issue EV_foo notifications.
While this is not optimal, it is probably good enough.  Still, I was
thinking about it, and a doubt came to mind: would it cause problems for a
bitmap to share the function for EV_foo and EV_foo notifications?
