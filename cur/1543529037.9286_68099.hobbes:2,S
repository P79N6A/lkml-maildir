I just tried 2.3.50.  I noticed 2 socket related problems:
Mar  8 08:36:00 rpppc2 xfs: Fatal font server error: 
Mar  8 08:36:00 rpppc2 xfs: Cannot establish any listening sockets 
Also gnuserv failed.  I haven't had time to investigate.  The exact
same config did not show this symptom on any other kernel (e.g.,
2.3.49).
