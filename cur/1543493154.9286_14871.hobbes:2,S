I know there was a version that didn't any accesses at all. And I
_thought_ the new one did reads, but I was obviously wrong. I can't
imagine why it would ever have been changed - I don't have the old emails
where I discussed the original problem with Larry saved..

Indeed. The benchmark is potentially useful (and we _will_ perform well on
it eventually), it's just that it's not nearly as useful as the obvious
"read only" version that apparently doesn't exist at all. 
However, it doesn't appear that Larry will change this any time soon, for
completely unrelated reasons ;)
