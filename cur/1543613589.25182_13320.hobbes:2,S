hi all
  I'm a novice ,here  I tried the first module prog 
given in the tutorial in the link
  
http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lkmpg/
   i followed all the instructions, verfied with
header files but on running make i get
        1.fist.c: In function `init_module':
        2.fist.c:11: warning: implicit declaration of
function `printk_Rsmp_1b7d4074'
        3.cc -Wall -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -DLINUX -c
fist.c
        4.echo insmod fist.o to turn it on
        5.insmod fist.o to turn it on
        6.echo rmmod fist to turn it off
        7.rmmod fist to turn it off
        8.echo
        9.
        10.echo X & kernel prog do not mix.
        11.X
        12./bin/sh: kernel: command not found
        13.make: *** [fist.o] Error 127
when I redirected my make file o/p from terminal only
lines 4 - 11 were in the
 redirected file. the rest were in the console. can
somebody explain me the reason.
 why do they echo the insmod & rmmod & other things? i
dont getit.
 All kind of explanations R welcome
