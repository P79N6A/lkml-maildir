You don't need to copy all of the packet, only as much of the header
that you want to examine (although the current linux libbpf wrapper always
copies the whole packet, but this is just a library bug @). 
Fixes for LPF are already done, they just have not been merged yet (I
expect them not in 2.2.2, but in 2.2.3-5 time frame)
