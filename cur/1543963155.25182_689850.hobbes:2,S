Only for a few filesystems which use that sort of housekeeping.

Same reason your shell waits for your program to complete before
showing the prompt again?

Say you had one realtime application running that would do lots of new
writes after the unlink finished. When the unlink is put into the
background, you interleave the unlink operation with new writes,
probably causing needless seeks and therefore not hitting the deadlines
anymore.
For you desktop use, `rm -f foobar.avi &` should do. No?
