Surely the fundamental disagreement is only due to DEBUG_RODATA
covering write-protection of both .text, and .rodata  ?
I can see value in having a kernel that supports kprobes, whilst
at the same point, raising red flags if something writes into
a const string. With my distro kernel maintainer hat on, I always
hate these 'pick one' decisions, because I always get convincing
arguments from proponents of both sides.
Was it always this way?  I thought DEBUG_RODATA initially just
covered, well.. rodata.    And kprobes only wants to change .text
doesn't it ?
