Happens for me also (on latest snapshot).
/dev/null is removed by this line in check-lxdialog.sh during a
'make menuconfig':
   echo "main() {}" | $cc -lncursesw -xc - -o /dev/null 2> /dev/null
This only happens if you don't have a libncursesw installed (not sure
if it is compiler dependant as well).
/dev/null being removed has many side-effects, this is just one of them.
Obviously 'cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV null' will fix.  Oh, and fixing the script
would be useful too ;-)
David.
