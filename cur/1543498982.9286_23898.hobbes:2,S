Thanks indeed. I could not even keep up with 1!
The only thing I'm a little worried about is the ominous messages about
"Backup, or you will be sorry" :)
In any case, doing an hdparm -Tt /dev/hdc gives these results currently
-d0 -c0
3.41M/sec
-d1 -c1
4.42M/sec
Not a great improvement (similar results on the non-UDMA drive). Which 
makes me wonder about my hardware.....
