Hi!
 When I use netscape 2.51 often it happens that netscape becomes slower and
 slower until it totally locks and even fails to do redraws.
 I have started a little script in the background which calls 'free' every
 ten seconds an put the result into a file.
 Then I fired up my pppd and  go surfing :-)
 Memory usage becomes more and more.
 Then, before netscape locks again, I exit it (close it), shut down my internet
 connection and take a look to the result of my little script.
 The memory still remains occupied. I haven#T changed anything, which is memory
 related before and after except the start and close of netscape.
 What happens here?
 I have included the list of 'free'-calls as described above as an attachment.
 PS: I also noticed locks with netscape 4.08 and moved to 4.51 therefore,
 without thinking this could be memory related. Now I think, the same effect
 will appear with netscape 4.08...
 KEEP HACKING!
