I applied the 10_parent-timeslice-5 patch to 2.4.4 and tested. (If I
understood correctly, the idea of that patch is to give the remaining
child time-slice back to the parent when the child exits, but only if
there have been no time-slice recalculation since the child was created.)
It is somewhat better than plain 2.4.4, but not much. I still see
scheduling delays in the range 30-120ms when running "./fork 0.4". (fork
is a program that starts a child, the child busy waits some time (0.4s)
and then exits. The parent then immediately respawns another child, etc.
See one of my previous messages.)
