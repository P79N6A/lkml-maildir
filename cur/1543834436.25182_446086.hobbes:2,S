namesys.com doesn't list reiserfs 3.6 hash collision limits in an easy
to find place (which would be the same place that boasts about 100,000
files per directory if it wants to be honest).

I'm not going to eat it while it's still steaming and fogging my glasses.
You're now making the same noise about how good reiser4 is that was made
when reiserfs 3.5 was a patch for Linux 2.2 and that wedged local access
when NFS exported, and 3.6 didn't fix the hash collision issue (but
required a format change, too, right).
