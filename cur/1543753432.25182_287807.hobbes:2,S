I sent Linus & Andrew a patch fixing the enable_kernel_altivec() thing
yesterday. cpu_features isn't missing, it's defined differently.

It's history. When I wrote that on ppc in the first place, I decided to
leave room for having slightly different CPUs so I defined it as an
array of NR_CPUs.
When we ported this to ppc64, we figured out we never actually used that
"feature", and that the way the dynamic patching works with CPU features
makes it mandatory to have identical feature sets anyway.
We should probably "backport" that simplification to ppc32...
