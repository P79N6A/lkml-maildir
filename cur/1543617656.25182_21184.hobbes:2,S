Hi,
I'm having some trouble with my box, at the time that i start an opengl 
game in X sometimes the load of my machine gets really high (not in all 
games Quake III runs just fine). when i try to move my mouse it won't 
move, when i press CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE nothing happens and I have to 
reset my system. Is this kernel related or just an opengl problen ? if 
it's kernel related I am running kernel 2.4.5 And my video-card is an 
NVIDIA geforce 2 pro 450 from gainward. before this card i had a diamond 
viper 770 ultra and the same problem occured. If this is not a kernel 
issue: where can i go to solve this ????
