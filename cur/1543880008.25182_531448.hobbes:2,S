Allowing N (where N can be one or greater) CPUs per run queue actually 
increases flexibility as you can still set N to 1 to get the current 
behaviour.
One advantage of allowing multiple CPUs per run queue would be at the 
smaller end of the system scale i.e. a PC with a single hyper threading 
chip (i.e. 2 CPUs) would not need to worry about load balancing at all 
if both CPUs used the one runqueue and all the nasty side effects that 
come with hyper threading would be minimized at the same time.
