 I don't know.  Currently it's used only in one place.  Actually, I
was thinking about moving it into the function where it's used.  But
if it's useful, renaming it to something like SCSI_CMD_CDB_SIZE()
(maybe make it inline function?) and moving to scsi.h shouldn't be any
problem.  I think we need to hear other people's opinions.  Some
inputs please.
 Thanks.
