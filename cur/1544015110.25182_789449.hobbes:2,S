Subject: [LIO-Target 0/5]: Convert statically sized structures to kmem_cache
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greeings all,
Here are a small series of patches that convert v3.0 LIO-Target data
structures that are statically sized at compile time to use struct
kmem_cache infrastructure.  Also, during the kzalloc()/free ->
kmem_cache_zalloc()/kmem_cache_free() conversion process, two memory
leaks where observed in different exception patchs, and where fixed.  
One was related to iscsi_r2t_t not being freed during
ErrorRecoveryLevel=2 for ISCSI_WRITE, and the other was
iscsi_datain_req_t for ISCSI_READ not being relased during a
NON_EXISTENT_LUN exception, immediately followed by an explict iSCSI
Logout.
These patches are against the lio-core-2.6.git tree, and tested on
v2.6.28.
