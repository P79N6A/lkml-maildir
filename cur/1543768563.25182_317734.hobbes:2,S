I got rc4-mm1 and booted it on an x86_64 machines with similar
configuration (no NUMA but SMP, numa slab uncommented) but multiple
configurations worked fine (apart from another error attempting to
initialize a nonexistand second cpu by the NMI handler that I described
in another email to you). I have no ppc64 available.
Could we boot the box without quiet so that we can get better debug
messages? Did the box boot okay without the patch?
