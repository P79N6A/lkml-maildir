Without knowing exactly what you are doing:
- Copies to uncached memory are very expensive on an x86 processor
(so it might be faster not to write and flush)
- Its not clear from your description how intelligent your transfer
system is.
I'd expect for example that the process was something like
	Parse pending commands until either
	1. Queue empties
	2. A time target passes
	For each command we need to shove a pixmap over add it
	to the buffer to transfer
	Do a single CLFLUSH and maybe IPI
	Fire up the command queue
	Keep the buffers hanging around until there is memory pressure
	if we may reuse that pixmap
Can you clarify that ?
If the hugepage anti-frag stuff ever gets merged this would also help as
you could possibly grab a huge page from the allocator for this purpose
and have to flip only one TLB entry.
