Well, I don't know the details of the plans, but IMHO is a dependency to
python for configuring the kernel not unreasonable. Nowadays a lot of
people don't even compile their kernels themselves, and thus not
_everybody_ is required to have python installed. When using make
menuconfig you are also required to have curses development files
installed even if you don't need them for anything else. Python also is
of (fast) growing popularity, and for example in Debian (I don't know
about other distributions, but I suppose it's similar there) Python is
Priority: standard (whereas libncurses5-dev surely isn't).
