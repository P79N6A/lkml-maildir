Hi, Paul,
Your Wavefront driver continues, flawlessly, here!

How very peculiar. This machine runs just fine on kernel 2.2.9, but
on kernel 2.3.3-ac2, after a few switches between standard consoles
and the X console (using ALT-Fn and CTRL-ALT-Fn) causes... many
interrupts to be lost. Sometimes the keyboard and mouse stop
working, sometimes even ping and telnet to the box won't go. But any
X programs running continue to update their displays.
Was your difficulty with 2.3.n or with 2.2.9 as well?
Thanks again for getting Wavefront working; I'm using it as a test
"other" synthesiser device for my wife's standard MIDI files (she's
a composer).
