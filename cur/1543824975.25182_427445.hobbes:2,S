No, but this (from Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt):
<clip>
	If a kernel module is built from several source files, you specify
	that you want to build a module in the same way as above.
	Kbuild needs to know which the parts that you want to build your
	module from, so you have to tell it by setting an
	$(<module_name>-objs) variable.
	Example:
		#drivers/isdn/i4l/Makefile
		obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN) += isdn.o
		isdn-objs := isdn_net_lib.o isdn_v110.o isdn_common.o
	In this example, the module name will be isdn.o. Kbuild will
	compile the objects listed in $(isdn-objs) and then run
	"$(LD) -r" on the list of these files to generate isdn.o.
</clip>
input.o would be the "module" name, and it would be by default build
from input-core.o, and if INPUT_FF_EFFECTS is enabled, then also input-ff.o.
Then any functions in input-ff.c that are called from input-core.c would
not need to be EXPORT_SYMBOLed to the rest of the kernel.
Note especially that the module name of such module can't be the same as
one of the source files that the module is built from (I tried). That's
the reason for the rename.

Maybe you know now.
