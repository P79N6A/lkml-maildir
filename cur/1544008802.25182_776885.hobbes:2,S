Subject: [PATCH] fs: reorder struct inotify_device on 64bits to remove padding
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/4/117

Reorder struct inotify_device to remove 8 bytes of padding on 64bit
builds, reducing size to 128 bytes . Therefore allocating from a smaller
slab & using one fewer cachelines.

Hi,
patch against 2.6.28-rc7.
built & tested on AMDX2 desktop.
I've not been able to send this to the listed inotify maintainers, I
just get mail failures. So I guessed filesystem was the best home for
it, hope that's ok. 
regards
Richard
