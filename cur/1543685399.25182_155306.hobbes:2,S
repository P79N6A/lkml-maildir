If the microcode in the CPUs is buggy, they are faulty and you should
demand to get them replaced at no cost.

I guess it would be possible to compile the microcode into the kernel
and have some code in arch/i386/* load it as early as possible.  As
long as you don't distribute the compiled kernel you should be fine
wrt licensing.
