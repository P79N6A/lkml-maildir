For what it's worth, the startup scripts for 'wine' and 'jexec' fail as well,
and at shutdown, I get complaints about being unable to dismount 
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc. 'strace' says:
open("/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/windows", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = -1 EN
OENT (No such file or directory)
# grep binfmt /proc/mounts
none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc rw 0 0
none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc rw 0 0
I have to wonder if the fact there's 2 of them mounted is related to the
fact that 2 startup scripts tried to touch files under fs/binfmt_misc/ ?
