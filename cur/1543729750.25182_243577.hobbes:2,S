I even wanted to port original driver from promise to 2.6 kernel...but
because at that time it was one of the moments when pata port "is coming
soon", I decided to not spent time for useless thing :)
Later my PATA drive which was connected  to this port has died , so I
have lost interest and migrate to 2.6 kernel without any problems :)
I don't know how it is going now, but...
I still can do it. 
Jeff, has it sense to port that damn driver finally or not?
Anton.
