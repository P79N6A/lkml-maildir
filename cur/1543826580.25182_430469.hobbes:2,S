Another thought, controlling whether console is attached or not is an
attribute of console, not of fbcon. It should be possible to have
VGAcon, fbcon, serial etc loaded and then switch console between them.
Does console need to get a sysfs entry showing what console providers
have registered with it and then allow you to choose which one (or
none) it is attached to?
