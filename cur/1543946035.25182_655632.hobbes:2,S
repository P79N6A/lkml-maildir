I have similar problems on my linux source partition which also
has a lot of hard linked files (although probably not quite
as many as you do). It seems like hard linking prevents
some of the heuristics ext* uses to generate non fragmented
disk layouts and the resulting seeking makes things slow.
What has helped a bit was to recreate the file system with -O^dir_index
dir_index seems to cause more seeks.
Also keeping enough free space is also a good idea because that
allows the file system code better choices on where to place data.
