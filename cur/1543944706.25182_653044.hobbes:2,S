Subject: UIO sysfs attributes broken in 2.6.25-rc1

In 2.6.25-rc1, there's a strange effect:
Although the map attributes "addr" and "size" show up correctly:
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 2008-02-13 17:49 addr
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 4096 2008-02-13 17:49 size
you cannot access them, not even as root. Something like "cat addr"
fails with a no-permission-error. It works fine in 2.6.24-rc8.
This is probably related to this patch:

Unfortunately, I signed-off that one, too... I checked if all sysfs
files appear, but didn't try to access them. Sorry.
Greg, any ideas?
Thanks,
Hans
