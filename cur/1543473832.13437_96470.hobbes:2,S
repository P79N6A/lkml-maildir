Right. The problem here isn't SCSI -- it's the disks you'll hook up to 
it. To do this sort of thing well, you'd want a far more intelligent
disk that knew about its own filesystem and expected to see requests
from more than one machine. With normal disks, you're taking a fairly
dumb piece of hardware and expecting it to act as a full network
host. It's a bit like trying to network your keyboard.
The Right Thing here is disks with enough intelligence to act as
reasonable independent entities on the network. With luck, you'll be
seeing more of this soon. Of course, I might be a bit biased here -- I
hack intelligent storage for a living, so I sort of have to think it's 
a good idea.
