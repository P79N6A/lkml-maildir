Hmmmm - that is showing up up a lot more frequently in 2.6.18 and 2.6.19
that we've ever seen before. Kind of strange given we haven't
changed anything the create transaction code for quite some time.
However, a machine named "sanandreas" is bound to go kaboom
at some point in time ;)

XFS will be returning an EUCLEAN or EIO to indicate the filesystem
has been shut down to all these write calls. Sounds like the clients
aren't handling the errors properly....

Do you have any idea of the workload that is triggering the XFS shutdown?
We need more error reporting traps in the create transaction so we can
track this down. As a first pass to narrowing down which code path
is failing, can you run this quick patch - we should get an extra line
in the kernel output just before the shutdown indicating what the error
was and which branch returned it.
Cheers,
Dave.
