Yes you were wrong, but no you're not right ;)
Leaving 2.4 out of it, taking it tree by tree:
Linus' 2.6.5-rc2: rmap.c's try_to_unmap_one uses find_vma under
protection of page_table_lock alone, swapfile.c's unuse_process
walks mm->mmap vma list under protection of page_table_lock alone
(other cases of interest? I've not looked further), mmap.c uses
page_table_lock to protect vma list manipulations, mmap_sem also.
Andrew's 2.6.5-rc2-mm3: as Linus.
Martin's 2.6.4-mjb1: unsafe: try_to_unmap_one (only used for anon
in this tree) and unuse_process rely on page_table_lock as in Linus,
but page_table_lock has been removed from some of the vma manipulation
in mmap.c e.g. vma_merge does __vma_unlink without page_table_lock.
Previous -mjb safer in unuse_process (using mmap_sem), unsafer in
detach_vmas_to_be_unmapped (no page_table_lock held).
Andrea's 2.6.5-rc2-aa4 (anon_vma): based on Martin's, but very
likely safe since it does not use find_vma at all in swapout, and
unuse_process downs mmap_sem as Martin's used to before.
Hugh's anobjrmap patches: as Linus (I left out -mjb mmap.c mods).
I believe that Martin should revert all the mmap.c page_table_lock
diffs from Linus in his tree (instead of reverting the patches you
show above), but that you Andrea can probably keep them with yours
(I've not reviewed enough to be sure).
(And of course, perhaps later on Martin will merge yours into
his and do one thing, or merge mine into his and do another.)
