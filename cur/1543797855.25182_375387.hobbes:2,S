My $0.02 worth: It is clear (from the standard) that the initial time 
is to be ABS_TIME.  It is also clear that the interval is to be added 
to that time.  IMHO then, the result should have the same property, 
i.e. ABS_TIME.  Sort of like adding an offset to a relative address. 
The result is still relative.

I don't think it really does that.  The TIMER_ABSTIME flag just says 
that the time requested is to be taken as "clock" time (which ever 
clock) AND that this is to be the expire time regardless of clock 
setting.  We, in an attempt to simplify the lists, convert the expire 
time into some common time notation (in most cases we convert relative 
times to absolute times) but this introduces problems because the 
caller has _asked_ for a relative or absolute time and not the other. 
  If the clock can not be set this is not a problem.  If it can, well, 
we need to keep track of what the caller wanted, absolute or relative.
It might help others to understand this if you were to remove the 
clock names from your queues and instead call them "absolute_real" and 
"up_time".  Then it would be more clear, I think, that we are mapping 
user requests onto these queues based on the desired functionality 
without a predilection to put a timer on a given queue just because a 
particular clock was requested.  At this point it becomes clear, for 
example, that a TIMER_ABSTIME request on the real clock is the _only_ 
request that should be mapped to the "absolute_real" list.
