This isn't exactly relevant to what you're asking.. but I have similar
troubles with my Vaio PCG-FX101 and 2.4.x.
I found that I couldn't make it boot without spending a long time playing
with the PCMCIA options, and it still locks up whenever I insert a cardbus
card.
This could be related to your problems - regardless of whether or not you
have PC Card inserted, there are certain cardbus chips which seem to lock up
in 2.4.x.
