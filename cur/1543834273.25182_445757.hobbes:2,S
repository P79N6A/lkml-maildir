Hmm, resume routine gets called but the controller seems to be
confused. It stopped reporting 1 in bit 3 of byte 0 in addition to not
reporting middle button. Does it allow you pasting if you
boot/suspend/resume with "psmouse.proto=exps" (assuming that psmouse
is built in)? If so then trackpoint portion of psmouse driver needs to
be looked at.
