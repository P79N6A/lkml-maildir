Hi,
Just wonder what exactly the difference between buffer and cache in linux 
memory management is.
Cache is used for filesystems, so that files read from a fs are kept in
memory in order to provide faster access next time.
Then what is buffer used for?
As executables are also kept in memory, are they in cache or buffer? 
Can somebody give any details on this? Many thanks!
