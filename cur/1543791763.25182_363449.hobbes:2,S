Not a recommendation. Just a point to be aware of. The ATI Radeons, to
get the best acceleration, seem to require that you use the ATI closed
source drivers. Currently I haven't found an ATI closed source driver
that supports 2.6.14. so I'm forced to use the Xorg radeon driver. I
have no idea if this is very good. I don't think so as my glxgear
numbers are pretty low. Much lower than the ATI driver running on
2.6.13-X.
NOTE: I'm horrible at setting up all the 3D stuff as I don't
understand what to chose and what to avoid. This could be far better
than the results I get!
