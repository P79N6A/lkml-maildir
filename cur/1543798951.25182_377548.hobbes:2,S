Yup - that would save oodles more than what we're dickering over here.

My position too ;).
I should quit wasting your time (and mine) with further fine tuning
of this test to skip rcu check if task->cpuset == &top_cpuset, and
instead consider removing CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT from at least ia64
(sn2), if not also from the other defconfigs that have it:
    collie            simpad            s390              se7705
    lpd7a400          bigsur            dreamcast         sh03
    lpd7a404          microdev          systemh           mx1ads
