But if you continue to boot the filesystems were still mounted and fsck has to
go over them and check for errors. In the case of ext2 this takes relatively
long depending on the size of the partition. However, this is only the
smaller problem, the problem of data loss is what worries me.
Instead, I'd rather issue a warning that the swsusp header mismatches, say with
which kernel the machine got suspended with and then start the countdown for reboot.
Thoughts?
