Speaking of practicality, would not it be easiest to add a mount-time
option that says "don't ever cache"? Or perhaps "enable cache, I
assure you I don't fiddle with the lower layer".

Not that I know much about memory handling, but...:
When a process writes to a file, the write is cached by default. If
now an origin tag (as in: a struct member) is attached to this cached
object, unionfs/VFS can decide whether the last write access has
happened from within unionfs or something else, and act accordingly,
namely (1) flush when origin tag is not "unionfs" (2) do as usual
like today's unionfs. Think of it like a "last changed by"-attribute.
