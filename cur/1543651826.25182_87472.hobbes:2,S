Yep, and since there are (unfinished) ports to MMU-less variants of machines
that are already supported by normal Linux, some more uClinux support may
appear in `normal' arch subdirectories in the future.
E.g. MMU-less Atari and Amiga (and Mac, anyone working on that?) are better off
with the platform support in arch/m68k/ than the one in arch/m68knommu/.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
