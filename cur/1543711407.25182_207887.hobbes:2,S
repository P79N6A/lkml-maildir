I believe what you are referring to is the OpenGroup's "ITAPI" work.
This is in a sense a competing spec to the DAT Collaborative
(www.datcollaborative.org) work.  The DAT Collaborative seems to be
far more open, and their spec is available without any hurdles.
Any demands from groups designing unacceptable specs should be treated
with the appropriate level of cooperation.
Note that neither the OpenGroup nor the DAT Collaborative are
affiliated with the InfiniBand Trade Association or the OpenIB group,
although they may have members in common.
Best,
  Roland
