I won't stand in the way of any of this, the list.h sort-of suggestion
was merely part of questioning the pgdat_next change. In fact, it was
meant more to point out what you just did, that the iterator takes the
field out of direct usage except for a couple of places.
I'll stand behind these changes as they are now.
Cheers,
Bill
