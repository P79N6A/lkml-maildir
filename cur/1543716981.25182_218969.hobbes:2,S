Since cpumask and global lock are on the same cacheline, and the global
lock still force that cacheline to bounce, it shouldn't make any
difference to remove the cpumask from that global cacheline, by the time
you take the lock you have the cacheline local and in the next
nanosecond you can use the cpumask zerocost. I understood the real cost
is the bouncing of _such_ cacheline across all 512 cpus and the global
lock will still generates it as far as I can tell. Though I'm mostly
guessing, I certainly wouldn't be against trying your patch, I was just
afraid it cannot help.
