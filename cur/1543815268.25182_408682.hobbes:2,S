On DOS et al, there are a number of special filenames, such as
	com1:
	com2: (and so on)
	lpt1:
	lpt2: (and so on)
	con:
	aux
	nul
(Try `dir >nul`, it's equivalent to unix's `ls -l >/dev/null` --
aux is the auxiliary port, whatever that is)
It seems only fair to me to not allow creating these files under Linux 
either, to avoid problems when booting back to Dos/Windows.
