Several questions: 
Is MCA an exception or fault of some sort, so at some point, 
the kernel would catch a fault?
So when you say "Touching poisoned data become a MCA", you mean that
if the CPU attempts to read poisoned data through the pci-to-host
bridge, it will (at some point) catch an exception?

I assume that the point of this barrier is to make sure that the fault,
if any, is delivered before this routine returns?
