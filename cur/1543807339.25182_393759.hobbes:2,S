You don't have this right either.  The way open() works:
If you specify O_CREAT (and not O_EXCL), it will create the file if  
it does not exist, and open the existing file otherwise.
If you specify O_EXCL (and not O_CREAT), it is implementation defined  
what will happen (in the Linux case, this opens a block device for  
exclusive access).
If you specify O_CREAT|O_EXCL, it will atomically create the file if  
it does not exist, otherwise it will return the error -EEXIST.
