What about discussed but not implemented moving restriction on non-head refs
from git-checkout (forbidding to checkout tags, remotes, and arbitrary
commits like HEAD~n) to git-commit (allowing commiting only to heads refs)?
Probably non-heads refs should be saved in HEAD as explicit sha1 of a
commit; this way we wont run into situation where HEAD changed under us
(because it was for example to remote branch, and we fetched since).
