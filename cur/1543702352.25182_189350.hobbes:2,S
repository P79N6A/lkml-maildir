You probably want to do logging at a higher level.  It's totally useless to find out
that LBA 2234324567 got re-written.  Mapping it to a partition on the disk so
you know it was something on /dev/hda7 is a bit better.  And being able to tell
that somebody updated the atime on /var/log/messages is most informative of all.
The other problem is that unless your laptop is *VERY* idle, you will have a scrolling
problem and buffering issues - so you end up writing to disk to log the buffers and... ;)
