Hi,
Some days ago I reported a PMTU bug I observed:
 +------------------------------------------------
 | I think I have found a Path MTU Discovery bug in Linux-2.2.7-ac1.
 | 
 | 1.  Linux sends a packet > PMTU
 | 2.  "ICMP Host Unreachable - need to frag" received
 | 3.  PMTU-sized packet is sent
 | 4.  data which comes after the packet from 1. is sent in PMTU-sized
 |     packets.
 | 
 | The problem is that the data remaining in the packet 1. which comes after
 | the PMTU length is never resent.  So the TCP connection stalls at this point.
 +------------------------------------------------
I just re-tested with Linux-2.2.7-ac2: the same thing happens.
The problem is easily reproducable.
SysInfo:
--------
dual CPU AlphaServer 2000 4/200, Linux-2.2.7-ac2 SMP,
well maintained Red Hat 5.2 / Alpha
egcs-1.0.3a compiler
(the one that comes with RH 5.2: there is no gcc in  RH 5.2 / Alpha)
