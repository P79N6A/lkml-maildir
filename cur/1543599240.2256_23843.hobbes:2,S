Subject: best mailinglist for porting from DOS2Linux?

Sorry if this is a little bit off topic, but I've been searching for
the best place to ask questions about porting DOS drivers to linux and
up until now I don't haven't found a decent answer...
Is linux-kernel indeed the best place to ask questions about DOS2Linux
(that is: how to translate DOS-specific things in DOS drivers to linux
drivers etc...) or are there other mailinglists that fit better on
that topic?
Thanks,
