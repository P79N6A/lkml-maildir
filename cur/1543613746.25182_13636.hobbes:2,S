Think of the following trivial case: 'the whole system is full of dirty
pagecache pages, the rest is kmalloc()ed somewhere'. Nothing to oom,
nothing to kill, plenty of swap left and no RAM. And besides, in this
situation, oom is the worst possible answer, the application getting
oom-ed is not at fault in this case.
