  Did you check the return value from mlock?
  Did you check the kernel source to make sure no cases have been
left out of the manpage?
  Have you taken account of the "imbedded" arch you're using?
  Have you checked the source for top and verified that the numbers
really mean what you suppose?
  Have you considered using some other tool for measurement or rolling
your own?
