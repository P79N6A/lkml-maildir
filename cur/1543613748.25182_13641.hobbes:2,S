By using a multi queue scheduler with global balancing policy you can keep
the core scheduler as is and have the balancing code to take care of
distributing the load.
Obviously that code is under CONFIG_SMP, so it's not even compiled in UP.
In this way you've the same scheduler code running independently with a
lower load on the run queue and an high locality of locking.
