OK, I've attached results for 20 second profiles of three
runs of each test: read-from-socket + write-to-file, and
read-from-socket + vmsplice/splice-to-file.
The test case and throughput is in the name: e.g. rvs-1-306MBps
is trial 1 of read/vmsplice/splice case, which ran at 306 MB/s.
Let me know if I can help with more testing, and thanks
again for looking into this.
