Blackfin's have a synchronous Serial Peripheral pORT (SPORT). 
Unlike SPI, UART, I2C, or CAN interfaces which are designed for specific 
industry standard compatible communication only, the SPORT support a variety 
(software programmable) serial data communication protocols:
 - A-law or µ-law companding according to G.711 specification
 - Multichannel or Time-Division-Multiplexed (TDM) modes
 - Stereo Audio I2S Mode
 - TDM Modes for Multi-Channel audio codecs
 - H.100 Telephony standard support
 - others, but if anyone really cares, they need to read the chip specs...
Bryan's patch takes the SPORT, and makes a standard UART out of it 
(exposing /dev/ttySS0) for those people who don't have enough hardware UARTs 
in their system.
Is it a SPORT driver that emulates a UART, or a UART driver on the SPORT? I 
think it is the latter...
Maybe:
[PATCH 3/3] Blackfin serial driver: enables a UART interface for the SPORT
Which still doesn't make any sense, until you know what a SPORT is :)
