I do not think that that is the problem. Yes that can cause
problems and ther eis a patch out there where you can set edge
or leve triggering.
I believe that there is some type of data coruption happening in
the kernel buffers but I have no proof of that. I have tried
changing my interrupt from edge to level and even to XT-PIC and
that did not stop the mouse from going bezerk, and also since
this is happening on UP machines as well where all the
interrupts are ... are XT-PIC it cannot be related to the edge
or level triggering.. it COULD be related to some common code
shared by all that gets called more by the edge triggering
however..
