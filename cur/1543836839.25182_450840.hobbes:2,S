After using 2.6.8 and 2.6.11 for a *long* time I decided to upgrade. When I 
first tried using 2.6.15 I tested a vanilla kernel and ran into the following 
message in the dmesg:
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@f0000000 for 0000:01:00.0
Since I'm running FC4 I figured that a fix might have made it into the distro 
supplied kernel, so I again upgraded, this time to 2.6.17-1.2142_FC4. I see 
the same message in the dmesg output, so I'm certain that it hasn't been 
fixed.
This is definately caused by my graphics card, an  NVidia GeForce 5200, just 
because that's the PCI ID of the AGP port.
I know a lot of you will tell me to file a report with RedHat, but after 
checking the LKML archives I see this problem was introduced around 2.6.13 
and though I saw some patches to fix this, I'm pretty certain they were 
either for x86-64 or were not ever merged.
Attached is the full dmesg.
