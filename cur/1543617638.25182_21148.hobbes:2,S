I was thinking there of peering at a crashed kernel with some debugger,
trying to see the page tables (or whatever).  In most cases, if they're
relevant to the problem, they will already be kmapped (or perhaps the
problem would just be that they're not).  The maintainers of debuggers
will probably need to add something to help find the right mapping.
But you're right, Linux is not primarily designed as a platform for
kernel debuggers, and that should not stop progress: sooner or later
we have to extend use of highmem, you've found good reason to extend
it to page tables (and Christoph's shmem index is a very similar case).
