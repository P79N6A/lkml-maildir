Doh!! Apparently I'm not as sharp as I think I am...
In looking into the DMA enable issue I came across
a thread in google that indicated that somebody else
couldn't get DMA on ALI M5229 IDE controller to work
and the suggestion was to make sure Generic IDE
controller support was NOT enabled in the kernel.
I took that advice. recompiled another kernel
with generic IDE support disabled (I did have it enabled
because I didn't know exactly what IDE controller
this had since ALI M5229 wasn't an option, though
I also enabled the alim15x3 driver just in case.)
Well having them both there seems to be what caused
the error.
When I compiled out the generic IDE stuff I also
avoided the recent workaround you provided. (Just to
see if it was needed when using the alim15x3 driver
or whether the presence of generic IDE was the root
of all of my problems.
Now, when I access the cdrom drive it does not lock
up. It doesn't even print anything about "many lost
ticks" anymore either.
But! I can only read from it (cdparanoia) I can't
write to it and this seems to be kernel related.
When I do:
    cdrecord -v -eject -dao dev=ATAPI:/dev/hda something.iso
cdrecord comes up and spits out:
...
   Warning: Using ATA Packet interface.
   Warning: The related Linux kernel interface code seems to be 
unmaintained.
   Warning: There is absolutely NO DMA, operations thus are slow.

And then the cdrom device hangs. Not the whole machine, just the
cdrom drive. (I'm typing this while the cdrom drive is locked up
for instance) It never even starts to write anything.
What I do get after quite a wait in /var/log/kern.log is:
Jun  9 14:43:00 localhost kernel: ide-cd: cmd 0x3 timed out
Jun  9 14:43:00 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
Jun  9 14:44:00 localhost kernel: ide-cd: cmd 0x3 timed out
Jun  9 14:44:00 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
Jun  9 14:45:00 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
So it looks like something is wrong with interrupt handling
still.
After a *very* long time the process seems to die and exit.
(Until I recompiled with some different options...)
I recompiled another kernel but this time:
   - I turned off the PM timer since I seem to have a HPET timer.
   - I turned off packet writing for CD writers.
   - I added back in the workaround patch you recently gave me.
Nothing of that helped. (And now it looks like no matter how
long I wait the stuck cd drive process doesn't seem to exit
ever.
So in summary:
    Reading works without the workaround patch but not if the
    generic IDE driver is in charge.
    Writing doesn't work under any circumstance.
That's all the compiling and rebooting I can handle for today.
Tomorrow I will try to turn on SCSI emulation and see if that
allows writing to work.
At least I can read CDs now though. Any thoughts on writing?
