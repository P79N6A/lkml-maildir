Hi,
Here is now the final release (it's as usual at 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/lc/
 ).
Changes in this release:
- help texts are a bit more indented (by two spaces) and long texts (more
than 10 lines), start with "---help---".
- in preparation of the library API I renamed a few structures/symbols.
Linus, nobody complained about it, so I put it now into your hands. :)
The easiest way is probably to use the converter with 'make install
KERNELSRC=...', which will convert your current tree.
The generated name is still Kconfig, if you prefer something different,
it's easily changable. The name is generated in cml1.y:gen_filename() and
only a search&replace in fixup-all.diff is needed.
bye, Roman
