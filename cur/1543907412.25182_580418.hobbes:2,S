I did some additional checking today...
On kernels prior to 2.6.22 line, the bug exists and manifests itself
exactly the same way. However, when I removed the "-h" flag
from /etc/init.d/halt, the drive spins down only once on "Power down"
message and there is no sign of the bug and the emergency unload count
remains constant. I've verified this on kernels 2.6.21.6; 2.6.20.4;
2.6.18-4-686-Etch.
The obvious conclusion is that something must have changed it the 2.6.22
kernels, so that removing the "-h" has no effect.
I dunno if my observations are of any value, but I thought You should
know...
Regards,
Michael
