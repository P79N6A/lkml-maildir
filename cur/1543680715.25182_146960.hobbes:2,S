Hello,
I want to use kernel 2.4.21 with the HTree and Orlov patches applied
with an ext3 filesystem. Where can I get the newest versions thereof
(for my desired kernel)? I've found
http://thunk.org/tytso/linux/extfs-2.4-update/
 and there is a 2.4.21
version and I found both the strings Orlov and HTree in it, but I don't
know if it's really the patch I want, if it's for ext3 and if it's the
newest version. I've also read of a HTree NFS patch, where can I get it?
Thanks in advance,
Oliver
