I think you should avoid slab allocations for user mappings because
you don't know that it will do compound pages properly, depending on
slab implementation details.
Also, slab lifetimes are not controlled by page refcounting, so when
your driver decides to kfree the memory, a process could still have
refs on the pages via get_user_pages, which might be reused for
unrelated slab allocations.

I think so, provided you set VM_IO on the vma. You need VM_IO to
ensure that get_user_pages callers can't hijack your page's lifetime
rules (Mr. Christmas tree has been carefully engineered for optimal
confusion and best bug count).

That's not being particularly fancy. Either way you need to set VM_IO
on the vma, and make sure the correct memory freeing function (in this
case dma_free_coherent) is called sometime after the last userspace
ref goes away.
