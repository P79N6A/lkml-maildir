It's too late now, but it _could_ have fairly easily been handled totally 
differently: namely by having the user-visible config options be 
INDEPENDENT of the actual back-end.
The Kconfig language is actually pretty powerful for configuration issues, 
and the way to do this is relatively straightforward:
	config CONNTRACK
		tristate "Netfilter support"
		...
	config NEW_CONTRACK_SUPPORT
		bool "Layer 3 Independent Connection tracking"
		...
	config CONNTRACK_MARK
		bool  'Connection mark tracking support'
		depends on CONNTRACK
		...
	config OLD_CONNTRACK_MARK
		bool
		depends on CONNTRACK_MARK && CONNTRACK && !NEW_CONTRACK_SUPPORT
		default y
	config NEW_CONNTRACK_MARK
		bool
		depends on CONNTRACK_MARK && CONNTRACK && NEW_CONTRACK_SUPPORT
		default y
See? The _user_ just sees a single "CONNTRACK_MARK" option (that just 
depends on the *generic* CONNTRACK config option), but then the Kconfig 
file splits that into "OLD_CONNTRACK_MARK" or "NEW_CONNTRACK_MARK" 
depending on whether "NEW_CONTRACK_SUPPORT" was set or not.

In general, I'd much rather see the config options impact what the "user 
experience" should be. Notice how the above does exactly that: all the 
USER really cares about whether the connection marks are enabled or not, 
and the "NEW_CONTRACK_SUPPORT" is _not_ part of the user-visible config 
(apart from the _one_ question that asks about which implementation you 
want to pick), but it is only used to pick which _implementation_ to 
choose.
So making the Kconfig files more user-oriented and less implementation- 
oriented automatically solves the problem with config options that change 
names (because if the effect is the same, it should have the same name - 
regardless of how it is implemented!).
