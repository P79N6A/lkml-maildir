What is pci_root_bus used for (i386)?
As far as I can see, nothing except pirq_peer_trick(), which just
pulls the ops pointer out of it ....
Seems somewhat redundant, especially as there's a pci_root_buses
list ....
Thanks,
Martin
PS. Not just an idle question, I'm trying to set up the PCI buses for
every node of a NUMA box.
