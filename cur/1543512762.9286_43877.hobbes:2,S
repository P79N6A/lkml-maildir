I'm now certain that my problem is different from yours.  With 2.3.21,
the system never sees *any* interrupt on IRQ 12.  Neither the interrupt
count is increased, nor is the handler called.
The code in pc_keyb.c hardly changed between 2.2.11 (which works well)
and 2.3.21.  In particular, the IRQ setup stuff wasn't touched at all.
So I suspect the problem is external to the keyboard/psaux driver.
The general IRQ handling stuff for i386 has been reorganized at some
point in 2.3.x.  Maybe something went wrong there.  Could someone tell
me the kernel version around which the reorganization was carried out,
please, so that I can investigate this further?
