I doubt that it is worthwhile to keep them in the current form for any other 
reason than compatibility (with existing software and people's habits). 
It doesn't make sense to describe things in 200 different formats, you won't 
help anybody with that. It also violates the good old principle of keeping 
policy out of the kernel. And, for me, layout is clearly policy.
The reason for proc's popularity is clearly that you can use any tool, from 
cat over more/less to the text editor of choice, and read the files. There 
should be ways to achieve this without putting things into the kernel.  Is 
there is a way to implement a filesystem in user-space? What you could do is 
to export the raw data using single-value-files, XML or whatever and then 
provide an emulation of the old /proc files and possibly new ones in user 
space. This could be as simple as writing a shell-script for each emulated 
file.

Why would anybody want a binary encoding? 
It needs special parsers and will be almost impossible to access from shell 
scripts.
