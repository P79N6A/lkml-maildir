The af_packet module may also be fairly inefficient. If you need performance
over, say, a gigabit link, you may have trouble. I last used it one of the
earlier 2.4 series (2.4.8 I think) with the Acenic Tigon II gigE copper
cards to implement a network flooder; At that time a simple unoptimized loop
sending raw ethernet packets maxed out at at around 80Mbps, while the same loop
sending UDP packets maxed out at around 400. This may have been fixed by now,
I don't know... Just a warning.
