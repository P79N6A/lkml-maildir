Hi Bart,
here's the ide_atapi_pc unification series. It all went pretty smoothly along
the search & replace line. Using driver-specific members in ide_atapi_pc like
idefloppy_callback and idetape_callback is kinda dumb but this approach seemed
the fastest versus unnecessary callback function signature change that will
touch stuff all over the place. Besides, ide-tape might be gone soon so that
would alleviate the problem.
On a different note, i noticed ide-scsi might also need a cleanup similar to the
other drivers. It is next on my TODO list in case you don't have anything with a
higher prio.
