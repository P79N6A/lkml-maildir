I've been going through the locking and its really hard to follow quite
what is being locked in places. The irq one is pretty nasty. We can't allow
an IRQ to come in - even momentarily during the lock and disable irq 
sequence, yet we can't disable the irq with locks held as the IRQ might
already be running.
I have the request queue stuff partly fixed now, I need to sort out the error
propogation bit.

Yes. And I dont envy any one trying to fix that IDE locking bug - its a nasty
one
