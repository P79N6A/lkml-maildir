I think you missed the point in the last discussion.  __mntput is called 
from mntput(), which autofs and nfsd call.  Their use is correct given 
what they do:
Autofs 3 and 4 use it for walking the vfsmount tree and determining 
if/when a mountpoint is ready to expire.
Nfsd uses it to serve up nfs exports that don't cross mountpoints (or 
do, if "crossmnt" is specified in /etc/exports.
Thanks,
