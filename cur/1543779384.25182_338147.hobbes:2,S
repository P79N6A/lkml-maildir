Even though the example doesn't work (the comment below the example even
indicates it shouldn't be done), I would suggest to still apply this
patch, as it shows the good usage of snprintf in stead of sprintf:
Somebody who looks at the documentation will certainly change the
contents of the attribute (this is by all means the reason for such an
example), but will not likely change the way sprintf is used.
Best regards,
Jan
