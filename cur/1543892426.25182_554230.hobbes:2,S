Admittedly this gives you the top five contention points, as my prototype
tracks this without accounting the total number of contentions for a
given lock in another counter.
If the above command line isn't good enough, we could easily put a total
contentions counter for each lock back in (see lock_stat_info).

Sure. I guess that applies to most other statistics.
