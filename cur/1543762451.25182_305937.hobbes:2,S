My shiny new nforce 4 main board has sound that is detected OK by ALSA:
  intel8x0_measure_ac97_clock: measured 49970 usecs
  intel8x0: clocking to 46877
  ALSA device list:
    #0: NVidia CK804 with ALC850 at 0xd2003000, irq 185
but I can't get my stereo to play.  It is connected via optical S/PDIF.
Works fine under Windoze, so the hardware is ok.
Any idea what I could do?
Felix
