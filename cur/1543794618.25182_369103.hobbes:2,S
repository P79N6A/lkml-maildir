I sent this out before, but it doesn't appear to have made the list.
Forgive me if I'm mistaken, and this is a repeat.
2 kernel files contain proprietary SGI copyright statements, and no
GPL copyright statement. The files are:
include/asm-ia64/sn/tioce.h
include/asm-ia64/sn/tioce_provider.h
These files (and copyrights) appeared somewhere after 2.6.13.
