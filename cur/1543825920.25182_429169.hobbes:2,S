I doubt that is the case. We are using a Pentium M 1.8GHz, and only
capturing low resolution 3 fps from bttv. Wifi data transfer is only
done in small chunks (we split the data in chunks at the application
level, ie p2p file sharing concept). CPU usage is extremely low, ie
less than 5%.

How did you solve your problem in that project?
