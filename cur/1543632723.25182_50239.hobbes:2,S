So I went ahead and implemented scheduler hints on top of the O(1)
scheduler. 
I tried to find a decent paper on the web covering scheduler hints
(sometimes referred to as hint-based scheduling) but could not find
anything worthwhile.  Solaris, for example, implements scheduler hints
so perhaps the "Solaris Internals" book has some information. 
Basically, scheduler hints are a way for a program to give a "hint" to
the scheduler about its present behavior in the hopes of the scheduler
subsequently making better scheduling decisions.  After all, who knows
better than the application what it is about to do? 
For example, consider a group of SCHED_RR threads that share a
semaphore.  Before one of the threads were to acquire the semaphore, it
could give a "hint" to the scheduler to increase its remaining timeslice
in order to ensure it could complete its work and drop the semaphore
before being preempted.  Since, if it were preempted, it would just end
up being rescheduled as the other real-time threads would eventually
block on the held semaphore. 
Other hints could be "I am interactive" or "I am a batch (i.e. cpu hog)
task" or "I am cache hot: try to keep me on this CPU". 
The scheduler tries hard to figure out the three qualities and it is
usually right, although perhaps it can react quicker to these hints than
it can figure things out on its own.  If nothing else, this serves as a
useful tool for determining just how accurate our O(1) scheduler is.
I am not necessarily suggesting this for inclusion; it is more of a
"just for fun" thing that turned into something with what I am actually
seeing improvements, so I post it here for others to see.
You use scheduler hints in a program by doing something like, 
        sched_hint(hint)
where `hint' is currently one or more of:
        HINT_TIME - task needs some more quanta, boost
        remaining timeslice
        HINT_INTERACTIVE - task is interactive, give it a
        small priority bonus to help.
        HINT_BATCH - task is a batch-processed task, give
        it a small priority penalty to be fair.
Right now the code makes no attempt to be fair - a program giving
HINT_TIME now will not receive some sort of penalty later.  Thus
sched_hint requires CAP_SYS_NICE.  This really is not what we want; we
need any arbitrary task to be able to give these hints.  Since the
current solution is not fair, however, we cannot sanely do that.
A patch for 2.5.20 is attached.  A patch for 2.4 + O(1) scheduler as
well as a lame example program can be had at:
