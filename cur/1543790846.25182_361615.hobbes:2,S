Fortunately you can use a real processor with 4GB of RAM as well as an
IA-64 (if you can find one even!). It is chipset dependant whether RAM
lost to the PCI window can be made to appear over the 4GB boundary with
a PAE capable intel ia32 processor (or clone) with an AMD x86-64
processor (or clone)
It depends entirely on the chipset quality
