It looks like CONFIG_4KSTACKS has gone away (IOW 8K stacks are no longer
an option).  But now I get this ominous warning when I compile
ndiswrapper:
*** WARNING: Kernel seems to have 4K size stack option (CONFIG_4KSTACKS)
removed; many Windows drivers will need at least 8K size stacks. You
should read wiki about 4K size stack issue. Don't complain about crashes
until you resolve this
As ndiswrapper seems to be the only option for many wireless chipsets,
this certainly looks like it will lead to regressions.
Why was this option removed?  It's pretty clear that lots of out of tree
drivers still require it.
