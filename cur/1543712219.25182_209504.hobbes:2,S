The reason I'm not subscribed to debian-devel is because it's full
of wankers discussing stupid pedantic points about matters they don't
understand.
Please drop linux-scsi and me from any further posts.  Thank you.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
