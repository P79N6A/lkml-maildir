This is already what is done in the slow path (in x86):
/* rdi:	pointer to rwlock_t */
ENTRY(__write_lock_failed)
	CFI_STARTPROC
	LOCK_PREFIX
	addl $RW_LOCK_BIAS,(%rdi)
1:	rep
	nop
	cmpl $RW_LOCK_BIAS,(%rdi)
	jne 1b
	LOCK_PREFIX
	subl $RW_LOCK_BIAS,(%rdi)
	jnz  __write_lock_failed
	ret
	CFI_ENDPROC
END(__write_lock_failed)
It spins lurking at the lock value and only if there are no writers nor readers that
own the lock, it restarts its atomic_sub (and then atomic_add in fail case).
And if an implementation of writers_waiting_for_lock() is needed, I guess this
is the perfect place. One atomic_add on a "waiters_count" on entry and an atomic_sub
on it on exit.
Since this is the slow_path, I guess that wouldn't really impact the performances....
