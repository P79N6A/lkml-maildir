All of the INPUT_ADD_HOTPLUG_VAR() calls do use add_uevent_var(), so we
should be safe there.  The other calls also look safe, if not a bit
wierd...  So I don't see how we could change this to be any safer, do
you?

We should have fixed that already by increasing the size of the buffer,
but yes, we should catch errors in the MODALIAS function, that would
have stopped that previous overflow.  Are you still seeing problems now?
