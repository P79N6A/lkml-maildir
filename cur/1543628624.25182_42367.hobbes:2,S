UnlockPage() looks like a simple clear_bit(), but it very much isn't.
I think it's better this way.

OK, I re-renamed the predicate back to PageSwapCache, added some
commentary about this.

OK, I've done this in a separate patch.

I moved the comment to unlock_page().

I wondered what that was doing there ;)  Done.
Updated patch series (compiles, untested, should be OK) is at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.10/
Thanks.
Sometime I'll bite the bullet and actually change all .c
files to include page-flags.h direct.  I did that yesterday
but wasn't happy with it.  There are some unfortunate dependencies
in pagemap.h and highmem.h which need cleaning up first.
