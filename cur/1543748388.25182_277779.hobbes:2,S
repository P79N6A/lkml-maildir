The patch below takes both the cases into

I am not able to think of a case, where 
address is invalid when it enters int3 handler.
I would appreciate if you can provide such a
test case.
Your comments are welcome.
Thanks

Stas reported that kprobes steals int3 exceptions when not in 
virtual-8086 mode. If processor  executes int 3 INT n type instruction, it
will end up executing int3 handler. This patch fixes the problem by returning 0,
if the int3 exceptions does not belong to kprobes and allowing the kernel to 
handle it.
