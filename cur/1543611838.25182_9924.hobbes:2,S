hi.
supposing i've got a "hotplug" style pci_driver,
but who's going to gain access to a device _not_ at initialization time,
i.e. not within pci_register_driver(), but rather somehere in a bottom
half. no pci_device_id* at pci_register_driver( ), since i don't
know the signature yet.
how do i request access here?
could anyone comment on the following please:
1. simple, but intrusive somehow:
	dev_probe_lock()
	if ( dev->driver == NULL )
		dev->driver = my_driver;
	dev_probe_unlock()
   is the locking correct?
2. rather use pci_announce_device()?
	my_driver->id_table =
       		somthing_i_just_built_on_the_fly_and_i_know_it_matches;
	pci_announce_device( my_driver, dev );
	/* probe() does the rest */
3. patch drivers/pci/pci.c?
	pci_acquire_device( struct pci *dev, struct pci_driver *drv )
	{
		/* fill in 1. */
	}
4. simply rely on the "compat", i.e. just taking over some resource?
   i think that's not why it's been called "compat"
any better ideas? something i'm missing?
besides: policy? -- do i _have_ to pci_register_driver() at during
initialization before considering to actually drive something?
any help appreciated.
regards,
dns
