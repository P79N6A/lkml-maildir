Hmm weird. It might be interesting to investigate in detail
what is going on there.

Dual core systems generally have it, It leads to better scheduling
on some older OS because in many aspects dual core is nearer HT than
a true dual socket systems. There was no traditional way to express 
"core siblings" in CPUID so they just faked HT again, but added some 
additional ways to detect real dual coreness. AMD does it similar 
(but slightly different). Of course modern kernels don't need such
hacks anymore.
