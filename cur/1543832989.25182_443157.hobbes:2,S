You may want to add as a secondary goal, splitting up some of the
huge 3-headed monster include files like sched.h
(It's better than it used to be, but it still sucks, and that thing
#include's the world).  Worst, iirc module.h pulls it in, which means
everything built as a module is pulling in hundreds of includes
even though most of the time, it'll never use anything from the
indirect ones.
ghviz & hviz from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/acme/
are invaluable for eyeballing include dependancies btw.
They need graphviz installed, and run like so..
ghviz include/linux/sched.h 10
to produce a pretty graph.

In many cases, adding forward references is a lot cleaner than
adding dozens of indirect include dependancies.
