I don't think it's the /perfect/ organisation by any means, but let's
consider the requirements:
 - Membership open to significant contributors to 'Linux' [1]
 - Has a voting process
 - Reasonably agnostic
Maybe an organisation like Linux International could handle this too,
but I don't know whether they have a membership process.

I ran the election last year (by counting hands) and there was no
weighting by contribution ;-)  More important though is the expressed
desire for the TAB to be more than kernel people.
[1] Is Linux even the right term?  The work done by the former FSG is
relevant to BSDs and Solaris.  Not to mention the kernel vs distro
discussion.
