You reported that the Adaptec management software did not indicate the
array was offline in the Adapter, thus these reports come when there is
a unrecoverable (non-redundant) bad block being read from the physical
media. The alternate to this is that such a condition or similar had
existed in the past, and the media bad block was remapped then marked as
inconsistent (as noted, until a write makes it consistent).
However, such conditions do not make the array inaccessible from dd as
you indicate (unless block 0 is the inconsistent block?); thus the array
must have been offline. Too bad we can not reproduce this, the
management applications must have indicated the array was offline (two
drive + failure).
