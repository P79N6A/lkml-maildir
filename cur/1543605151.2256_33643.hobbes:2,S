This is the fifth link bundling implementation for linux now
(TEQL, bonding, EQL, multipath routing are all in tree and do similar things)
TEQL, EQL do not know about streams, so they're not too useful. There
are some patches for the bonding device to add probalistic stream balancing,
which will likely make it equivalent to your code.
I personally prefer the fourth because it is the cleanest and most flexible.

multipath routing supports load balancing for incoming connections using
the arp filter. Basically it'll filter arp responses based on the outgoing
filter and this leads to an automatic distribution of incoming traffic.
It distributes routes (IP<->IP,TOS) pairs, not L3 streams however; but that
seems to be sufficient for most usages. It's also very easy to do 802.3ad on 
top of it.
If you wanted to do it for streams I think it would be better to use
the existing infrastructure for it -- this is netfilter connection
tracking -- and make it generate multiple routes.
It also provides failover BTW with some support from user space (e.g. an
OSPF daemon)
