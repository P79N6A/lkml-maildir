Hi,
in an application that MAP_PRIVATEly mmap()s a file it would
be quite helpful for me to find out which pages have been
copied-on-write.
I found that mincore() does a similar thing by reporting which
pages are currently residing in physical memory, but what
I want to know is which pages differ from the original file
image on disk.
Can you recommend a way to do that? (does not need to be
portable beyond Linux)
Alternatively, it would be sufficient if I could turn
a private mapping into a shared one (and possibly do an
msync() afterwards if I need to make sure the changes
have been written out). Would such a feature need a
lot of effort to implement?
Yet another feature that I could use if it were available:
A "copy-on-read"-mapping. There, a page would become a private
copy of a process once _another_ process wrote data to the
corresponding file location. But I suspect that feature
could be very hard to implement...
Regards,
Lutz Vieweg
