Taskfile completion and struct request completion are separate.  That 
results in
* struct request received by libata
* libata detects errata
* libata creates 2 struct ata_queued_cmd's
* libata calls ata_qc_push() 2 times
* Time passes
* ata_qc_complete called 2 times
Option 1: {scsi|block} complete called 2 times, once for each taskfile
Option 2: {scsi|block} complete called 1 time, when both taskfiles are done
one way:  2 h/w completions, 1 struct request completion == 1.5
another way:  2 h/w completions, 2 struct request completions == 2.0
Maybe another way of looking at it:
It's a question of where the state is stored -- in ata_queued_cmd or 
entirely in struct request -- and what are the benefits/downsides of each.
When a single struct request causes the initiation of multiple 
ata_queued_cmd's, libata must be capable of knowing when multiple 
ata_queued_cmds forming a whole have completed.  struct request must 
also know this.  _But_.  The key distinction is that libata must handle 
multiple requests might not be based on sector progress.
For this SII errata, I _could_ do this at the block layer:
ata_qc_complete() -> blk_end_io(first half of sectors)
ata_qc_complete() -> blk_end_io(some more sectors)
And the request would be completed by the block layer (right?).
But under the hood, libata has to handle these situations:
* One or more ATA commands must complete in succession, before the 
struct request may be end_io'd.
* One or more ATA commands must complete asynchronously, before the 
struct request may be end_io'd.
* These ATA commands might not be sector based:  sometimes aggressive 
power management means that libata must issue and complete a PM-related 
taskfile, before issuing the {READ|WRITE} DMA passed to it in the struct 
request.
I'm already storing and handling this stuff at the hardware-queue level. 
   (remember hardware queues often bottleneck at the host and/or bus 
levels, not necessarily the request_queue level)
So what all this hopefully boils down to is:  if I have to do "internal 
completions" anyway, it's just more work for libata to separate out the 
2 taskfiles into 2 block layer completions.  For both errata and 
non-errata paths, I can just say "the last taskfile is done, clean up"
Yet another way of looking at it:
In order for all state to be kept at the block layer level, you would 
need this check:
	if ((rq->expected_taskfiles == rq->completed_taskfiles) &&
	    (rq->expected_sectors == rq->completed_sectors))
		the struct request is "complete"
and each call to end_io would require both a taskfile count and a sector 
count, which would increment ->completed_taskfiles and ->completed_sectors.
Note1: s/taskfile/cdb/ if that's your fancy :)
Note2: ->completed_sectors exists today under another name, yes, I know :)
