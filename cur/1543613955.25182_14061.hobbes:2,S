Hi Rusty,
I appreciate the noble gesture of allowing NUMA people to
locate the per-cpu areas in different places in memory ;-)
That said, memcpy of static per-cpu areas doesn't seem right.
Why copy the same area to all the dynamically allocated per-cpu
areas ? Also, shouldn't the size be &__per_cpu_end - &__per_cpu_start ?
And how do we use this with per-cpu data used right
from smp boot, say apic_timer_irqs[] ?
Thanks
Dipankar
