And that's pretty much exactly okay.
You got success return when you wrote "255" there, then you got
-EINVAL when you tried to put newline there. Expected behaviour, I'd
say.
...I can see it looks ugly when you do echo manually, but you simply
should not do that.

Well, they got what they deserve, that \n does not belong there. And
they _did_ get success report -- "3" was returned. That's how unix
works, I'd say. Educate userspace authors that adding \n is bad idea.
