Jari, you're starting to annoy me. You have been campaigning with FUD
against cryptoloop/dm-crypt for too long now. There are NO exploitable
security holes in neither dm-crypt nor cryptoloop. There is room for
improving both IV deducation schemes, but it's a theoretic weakness, one
which should be corrected nonetheless. However, modern ciphers are designed
to resist known-plaintext attacks. The default setup of loop-aes' initrd is
a greater threat to security, but wait for my paper on this. In the
meantime, stop spreading FUD, especially stop abusing the term "backdoored"!
