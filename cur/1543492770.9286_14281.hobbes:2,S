I'm having a problem with my Compaq Contura 410 laptop:
Sometimes, at apparently random intervals, the keyboard and the screen
completely freeze. It is not a complete lockup though, the system is up
and running, and will respond well to net (PCMCIA) and disk requests, all
processes seem to be up and running correctly.
To restore the console, a freeze-unfreeze cycle is sufficient.
Setup: deban-2.1, with both kernel 2.0.36 and 2.2.5, pcmcia-cs/3.0.9
Another similar problem I experienced (only with 2.0.36 as of now),
although not very often, is that sometimes the display will 'freeze' the
even columns, while updating correctly the odd ones. A reboot is needed to
fix this one.
Sorry I can't be more accurate, and thanks for any help or suggestion.

Why won't you let me kiss you goodnight?  Is it something I said?
