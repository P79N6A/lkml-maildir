An iSCSI device is a physical device; it just doesn't reside on the local 
system. We should represent the device in some physical form, since the 
logical class mappings do/will assume a mapping to a physical device. 
These devices are essentially children of the network via which they're 
attached. When devices are discovered, I'm assuming you can derive the 
network device through which you're communicating, so you can get enforce 
the ancestral relationship. 
You want the ancestral relationship for several reasons. You'd wouldn't 
power down such a device on PM transitions or during shutdown, but you 
would stop I/O transactions. The drivers for these devices should recogize 
it's a remote device and handlethis. And, if you were to remove the bridge 
device (the network card, etc), you want the devices behind it and their 
logical mappings to go away gracefully.
Mulitpath devices, which you could easily have with multiple routes to the 
same IP address, are another issue that must be addressed. It hasn't yet, 
but we're getting closer...
