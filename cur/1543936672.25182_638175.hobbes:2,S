Yes, I've only spotted it on loopback.  The odd part is that I had reverted the
one commit 9c6ad8f6895db7a517c04c2147cb5e7ffb83a315 "Convert the netif code to
use ifindex values" - so either I managed to get the revert terribly wrong,
or there's something else odd going on.  The first time around, I was seeing
hangs during a TCP 3-packet handshake - this time data flows for some number
of packets before hanging.
I'm pulling  git://git.infradead.org/users/pcmoore/lblnet-2.6_testing at the
moment, and seeing if there's already a fix in there for this.
