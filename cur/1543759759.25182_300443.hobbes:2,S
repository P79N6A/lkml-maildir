Hi list members,
I've been doing some reverse engineering of madwifi HAL (Hardware 
Abstraction Layer) object file recently.
I ended up with an almost complete source code for one chipset so far 
and I was wondering if it is legal
to publish such source code on the internet? The note on a card says it 
is "protected by us patents <patents number list>".
Does the patent apply to the reverse engineered source code, or just to 
the hardware? Or is it even legal to create such source code?
I would like to ask for some comments regarding this case. And let's say 
the driver works, would it be included into kernel source ?
regards
Mateusz Berezecki
