Sorry to pick you Andries, but could at least those of you who add printks
_please_ use an appropriate log level, it's bad enough that so much existing
code ignores them.
Call me silly or tell me that I'm doing needless work, but I try to check that
the code that's actually compiled into my kernel or the modules I need/use do
use log levels in order to make it possible for syslogd to obey my
configuration, which for me most prominently means  'echo info level stuff
only to var/log/messages and /dev/tty12'.
And while I only can blame myself for not having forwarded the changes to the
respective maintainers, I think is the right thing to request what I do.
Just to make it clear (as english isn't my native tongue and as I know of the
problems of mail based communication, I'm not always sure I do express myself
appropriately), I don't intend to flame you or anybody else but rather appeal
that this be changed.
