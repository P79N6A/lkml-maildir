Who the hell am I kidding? I haven't been able to sleep right for the last 
few days over this bug. It was really getting to me.
And putting on the thinking cap, there's actually a fairly simple an 
nonintrusive patch. It still has a tiny tiny race (see the comment), but I 
bet nobody can really hit it in real life anyway, and I know several ways 
to fix it, so I'm not really _that_ worried about it.
The patch is mostly a comment. The "real" meat of it is actually just a 
few lines.
Can anybody get corruption with this thing applied? It goes on top of 
plain v2.6.20-rc2.
