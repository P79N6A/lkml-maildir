What do you mean by "power outage" ? If you mean cutting the power, this
is not a serious reason for EEPROM damages, unless you were modifying it
at that moment.

Maybe 3Com's DOS-based tool (3c90xcfg.exe) can help.
In order to re-write the EEPROM, you need to use vortex-diag; I think that
you need to hack it a bit as the EEPROM writting code is not enabled. But
most important is that you need a good EEPROM image to write; if you have
another similar card, you can use vortex-diag to dump the EEPROM, then
change the MAC address (if you put both cards on the same network
segment). If you don't have a similar card... you have to download the
card's documentation from 3Com and build your own EEPROM image based on
what you know about your card's capabilities - having an EEPROM image from
a different card might screw things up badly.
If you decide to go the last way, maybe I can help with some
interpretation of the docs - please e-mail me in private.
