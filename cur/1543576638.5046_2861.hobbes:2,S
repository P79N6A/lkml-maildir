Can you check what does Linux 2.4.0-test<latest> behave, please?
I know of these problems and I hope the new PCI code in 2.4.0 is able
to assign the missing memory/IO resources without help of the BIOS, but
unfortunately 2.2 isn't and it's very difficult to back-port the fixes
as they depend on changes in many other parts of the kernel.
You probably should make the ltmodem driver check the region base
registers and interrupts and if they are not set, recommend the user to
change the OS or PNP settings in their BIOS setup.
				Have a nice fortnight
