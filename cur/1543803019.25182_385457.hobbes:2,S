While we're on the topic, what *is* the best place to solicit hardware
donations for purposes of driver development?
I ask because the snd-nm256 driver is one that we know users have, but
the ALSA driver has never worked (sound OK but the machine frequently
locks up IIRC, see ALSA bug #305), and the device has been unavailable
for years.  Basically these users are screwed if we can't get a hardware
sample, but I think that might mean someone has to give us a whole
laptop.
