Done. It's all good under 2.6.16.20. Thanks for that. I'm wondering
though. I checked the minimal requirements in the
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes file but nothing is mentioned for
LVM there. Is this no longer the right place to check for what userspace
utils are required for certain kernel functionality? (or was it never the
right place?)
