Clarify the comment regarding the "next" field in struct dm_target_spec. The
"next" field has different behavior if you're performing a DM_TABLE_STATUS
command than it does if you're performing a DM_TABLE_LOAD command.
See populate_table() and retrieve_status() in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c for more
details on how this field is used.
