Correct, that is in principle possible. We went through this discussion 
on the mailing list  .. (Rik, Shailabh help me out here) and decided 
that mostly that is
not being required. The extra overhead of putting that we deemed 
unnecessary.
Instead, if really desired, one would require a different classtype for 
each of those groupings. Note however, our entire infrastructure already 
supports that in that RCFS would pick these specialized class types up, 
provide the proper hierarchy as an FS subdirectory structure. For us it 
was mainly a question how we can get the most out of the initial 
prototype without having general users have to go and specify all kinds 
of hierarchies, i.e. one per resource.
