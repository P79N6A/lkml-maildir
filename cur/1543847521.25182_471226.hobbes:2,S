So far I have seen all of that higher level information in the kernel,
and it has to export it to user space for the user space daemon to
do anything about it.
The only time I have seen user space control being useful is when
there isn't a proper default policy so at least you can distribute
things between the cache domains properly.  So far I have been
more tempted to turn it off as it will routinely change which
NUMA node an irq is pointing at, which is not at all ideal
for performance, and I haven't seen a way (short of replacing it)
to tell the user space irq balancer that it got it's default policy
wrong.
It is quite possible I don't have the whole story, but so far it
just feels like we are making a questionable decision by pushing
things out to user space.  If nothing else it seems to make changes
more difficult in the irq handling infrastructure because we
have to maintain stable interfaces.  Things like per cpu counters
for every irq start to look really questionable when you scale
the system up in size.
