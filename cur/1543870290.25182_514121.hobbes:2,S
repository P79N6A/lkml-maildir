If you can replace them with something simpler, and no worse than 10%
slower in worst case, then go ahead. (We actually tried to do that at
some point, only to realize that efence stresses vm subsystem in very
unexpected/unfriendly way).

Too bad. Now you can start Linux fork called Eugenix.
(But really, Linux is not "maximum performance at any cost". Linux is
"how fast can we get that while keeping it maintainable?").
That is why, while arguing syslets vs. kevents, you need need to argue
not "kevents are faster because they avoid context switch overhead",
but "kevents are _so much_ faster that it is worth the added
complexity". And Ingo seems to showing you they are not _so much_
faster.
