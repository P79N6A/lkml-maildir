Oh, but it does.
System administrators can use steal time the same way they
use iowait time: to spot bottlenecks on their systems.
If you have a lot of iowait time, you know you want either
faster IO or more memory.
If you have a lot of steal time, you know you need to spread
your virtual machines over more CPUs.
Steal time allows you to see the difference between a busy
system and an overloaded system.
