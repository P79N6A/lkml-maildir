X also needs to be able to map at zero for vm86, which makes this a lot less
useful.  In particular, the interrupt vectors need to point to the right place
within the VBIOS we're calling into, so we have to be able to map the zero page.
(And often write to it, if we're posting a non-primary card.)  Obviously this
isn't so much an issue for non-x86, where you have to use the emulator anyway.
And I'm pretty convinced that calling vm86 in a SMP environment is just suicide
so you _ought_ to use the emulator even on real x86.
We've already got the infrastructure in place to completely fake the real mode
address space for the emulator.  IWBNI we had some way of presenting a set of
virtual-address-space pages as contiguous to the vm86 task, since if we had that
we could just malloc 1M, copy in the bits we need, and go.  I don't know if vm86
mode supports that in silicon; it certainly isn't exposed in the API.  Anyone
know?
Actually it's a little worse than that.  Some chips have an escape hatch where
they remap banks of registers into the 64k VGA aperture, and the BIOS relies on
this.  So some of the pages need to be backed by device mappings, and some by
plain memory.  You'd really need either an array of pointers to userspace pages,
or a trap handler like how vm86 handles I/O cycles.  Again, I don't know offhand
whether vm86 can do this, but if it does then fixing X to take advantage of it
is pretty easy.
