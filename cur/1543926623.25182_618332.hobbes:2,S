This 'patch' did not work.
I tried setting the physical mem to just below the va addresses the
PEX is being assigned (0xea900000 (3753M) and everything works...
I set it to just above - and it gets miscellaneous boot problems....
like binfmt problems when attempting to insmod a module at boot time
("runaway loop modprobe binfmt_????" (?=I forgot to write down #) - this
was mem=3850M) or downright hanging after kernel has initialized and 
it says "freeing kernel memory" (i.e.: where it attempts to run init
on the root harddrive).
IMHO, this tells me that perhaps there is somewhere else in the sata_mv
code that is either modifying / accessing edma registers or something
like this - that just doesn't seem right!
I am going to try to port forward the driver that I know works and see
if there are still any problems...stay tuned!
Tom

I don't know much about how 32-bit PPC deals with memory addresses
that are more than 32-bits..
But does this patch have any effect:
