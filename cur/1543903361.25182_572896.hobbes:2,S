Why will it fork? I don't think it will ever happen that the trees
will have large pieces that _has_ to be different one from the other.
So if it's forking to achieve some benefits, why can't i386 get the
benefits too? I think this is the whole point here.
Surely as it is today (and just because it wasn't merged earlier and
the past!), the x86_64 tree has a bunch of things that are quite
better structured than the i386 (and maybe vice-versa, but I must
admit that unlike Steven Roasted, I like the x86_64 a lot more). But
in the long term,  it tends to just get the best of each picked up.
And oh yeah, i386 is older, has a lot more corner cases, but even if
it does count against the merge, we have a net win at the end.
