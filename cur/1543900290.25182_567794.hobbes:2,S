Hi Wei,
I was referring to:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&m=118290909528910&w=2
async_tx is an api that exploits the raw capabilities of the new
dmaengine interface.  For your case when the existing api calls do not
provide the proper interface you can open code something like the
following:
tx = dev->device_prep_dma_<operation>(chan, len, int_flag)
tx->tx_set_src(dma_addr_t, tx, index /* for multi-source ops */)
tx->tx_set_dest(dma_addr_t, tx, index)
tx->tx_submit(tx)
The expectation is that the most common usages of dmaengines will use
async_tx calls, or the 'dma_async_memcpy_foo_to_bar' helper routines.
