Well! We went over this two years ago. The problem is that segment
overrides are specifically excluded for the LODS, LODSB, LODSW, and
LODSD instructions on the '486. (Page 16-203, Intel Rag called
Intel 486 Microprocessor Family, Programmer's Reference Manual).
This comes about (shown on page E-23) because the sreg field
is two bits on some instructions and 3 bits on others. Three
bits allows FS and GS segments to be specified, two bits allows
only the ES, CS, DS, and SS segments. The sreg field in the
LODxx instruction does not exist! (page E-9). So you get whatever
you get.
However, many respondents showed that they __worked__!  It was the
general consensus that we had better not use such undocumented
op-codes even if for no other reason that a segment-prefix is an
extra instruction that eats CPU time.
There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to use segment-overides in
any of the code. The problem is that to eliminate them would require
a complete rewrite from scratch. The original 'asm' boot code was
not too bad. However, through the years it's been added to in many
"strange and wonderful" ways. The result is obvious. The recent
rewrite to GAS assembly did not improve anything.
