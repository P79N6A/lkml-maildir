This is a known problem which I'll fix as soon as I have a
solution.
The problem is that we still have no good way to balance
how much memory we take from the cache and how much memory
we take from processes.
This means that for some workloads we'll be evicting too
much cache while for other workloads we'll be evicting too
much process pages...
If anybody as a good idea to make this code auto-balancing,
please let me know.
regards,
Rik
