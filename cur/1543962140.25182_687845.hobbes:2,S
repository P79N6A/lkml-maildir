this is kindof bullshit, You can never be sure that something works
perfectly for everyone, if there were to be so excessive testing that
you would be willing to make such a bold claim, any "stable" kernel
would be years in testing.. Linux stability also seems to be okay, and
people who wants to lower risk of problems can simply choose to use
slightly older versions.
What i find more of a problem is long term effects and problems of
changes.
For instance, Linux has slowly and steadily been getting alot more
sensitive to IO, and ALOT more memory hungry..
I Recently found a system with a 2.6.4 kernel, and when i upgraded to
2.6.23, i saw memory usage increase from ~250mb to around 500. I
upgraded to .25 to see if it was some weird bug, but it is the same.
Unfortunately i cannot investigate more, as i only had the box for a
very short time, but this is alot more concerning to me.
Unfortunately i dont think i can easily reproduce this as i am unsure
how to actually get to test 2.6.0 through .24 easily..
