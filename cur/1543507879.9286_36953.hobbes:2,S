Im reading the BIGMEM codes, and it seems that BIGMEM and rawio are
incompatible.
Is that correct?
Are there any plans to change that?
I think that rawio must do something if BIGMEM is set:
* the database vendors might use rawio
* large databases could run on computers with > 2 GB memory.
Btw, why do you use the full buddy algorithm with 10 lists for bigmem?
currently, only single pages are allocated, so 1 or 2 lists should be
sufficient.
