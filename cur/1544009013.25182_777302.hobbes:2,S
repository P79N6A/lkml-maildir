Can I ask - and this is a real question, I'm not being sarcastic - is
that statement made with substantial serious experience in performance
analysis behind it, or is it just an intuition?
I will happily admit that I am not a great expert on performance
analysis with years of experience.  But I have taken a bit of a look
at what people with that sort of experience do, and I don't think they
would agree with your "doesn't matter" statement.

And I think that is the fundamental flaw.  On the machines I am
familiar with, the performance counters as not separate things that
can individually and independently be assigned to count one thing or
another.
Rather, what the hardware provides is ONE performance monitor unit,
which the OS can context-switch between tasks.  The performance
monitor unit has several counters that can be assigned (within limits)
to count various aspects of the performance of the code being
executed.  That is why, for instance, if you ask for the counters to
be frozen when one of them overflows, they all get frozen at that
point.
And that's how the hardware is designed because that's how the people
that do performance analysis want to do their measurements.  This idea
of splitting things up into separate counters that look independent
but aren't is just going to cause unnecessary complications and
difficulties.
