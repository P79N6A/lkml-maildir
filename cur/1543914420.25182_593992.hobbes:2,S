No, the machine is not being suspended at all.
What happens is, there's a nice little LED on the Cruzer stick,
that is "lit" when the stick itself is not in a "power suspend" state
(or whatever you USB folks call it).
On 2.6.22, that little LED stays "on" normally, and flickers off/on
when data is being transfered.
The new "USB autosuspend" logic in 2.6.23 now causes that little LED
to turn off after a few seconds of inactivity.
Once that happens, the USB stick is not accessible until after a longish
timeout (~30s I think), followed by a USB reset.  Then it is usable again
until the next inactivity timeout and autosuspend (a few seconds).
Etc.
