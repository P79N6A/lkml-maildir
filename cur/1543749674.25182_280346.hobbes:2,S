Hi,
I have some weird problems with my pendrives recently. I just compile a
2.6.9 to check if the problem is still exists there.
current kernel is 2.6.10-rc3 and the situation is the following:
If I copy more than few megabytes to the drive, the activity LED keeps
flashing forever. sync, umount keeps runing forever, normal reboot is
inpossible (alt+sysreq+b seems to work)
Tested with usb 1.1 and 2.0 pendrives, behaviour is the same.
Any ideas?
P.S: Please cc directly to me, I am not subscribed, thanks.
