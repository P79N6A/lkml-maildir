 Other systems may (and do) have an external APIC.  This includes i486 and
all Pentium systems.  Note that the code doing a run-time check in
<asm/bugs.h> does a check for X86_FEATURE_APIC in
boot_cpu_data.x86_capability -- if the bit is reset then the local APIC is
external (there's no on-chip local APIC or it's disabled) and the test
does not panic() even if the stepping indicates the erratum is present.
