You can't currently use the destructors for that (at least not without 
changes). They are used by the socket accounting mechanism and there is
no way to prevent the final kfree from the constructor (the only way to
make it work without source changes is to always keep the refcnt > 0 and
collect them with a timer -- not recommended) 
A zone may work, but it is possible that you'll run into VM balancing 
problems. 
The sanest way is to probably add your own destructor to skbs.
