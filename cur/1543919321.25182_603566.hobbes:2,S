There will be no change in API. Driver will accept a parameter
"locality" and it will always operate on that locality. By default this
parameter will be 0 which is what current driver assumes.
Who is the maintainer for this driver?

Make sure you extend the API in such a way that older userspace programs
that don't pass the new locality parameter still work correctly.
