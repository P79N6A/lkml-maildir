I looked over them, and cfq_cic_link() should use _irqsave() instead of
_irq() if called without __GFP_WAIT set. That doesn't happen in the
normal io path though, so I'm not sure that is it.
So if the bug is using spin_lock_irq() with interrupts already disabled,
iirc that would trigger a different warning...

Naturally, that is a bug fair and simple, nothing to do with lockdep.
