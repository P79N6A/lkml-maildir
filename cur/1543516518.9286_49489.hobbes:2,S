I upgraded kernel from 2.2.14pre4 to 2.2.14pre7
and I met a trouble of ethertap.
I use PPxP for PPP connection to my ISP.
http://www.linet.gr.jp/~manabe/PPxP/
PPxP uses ethertap and it worked well with 2.2.14pre4 or
earlier, but when I reboot after installation of 2.2.14pre7
it didn't work.
Connection was established, IP address has got but
ping didn't work.

This result is very similar to the case when I rebuilt RedHat-6.1's
kernel-2.2.12-20.src.rpm on VineSeed(development version for Vine Linux).

I'm not sure when ethertap enbugged between pre4 and pre7,
I'll check later so wait a while.
If you know a way to survey this truble further, please tell me.
Sorry for vague report.
