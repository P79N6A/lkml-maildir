See linux/Documentation/modules.txt and Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt
for how to do this properly.  Basically put your source and Makefile
in a subdir, then use this command and it builds without that error.
(Your source had a few other warnings, but it does build this way.)
Here's the Makefile that I used, with usage info in it:
# makefile for addonmodule
# Randy Dunlap, 2003-02-21
# usage:
# cd /path/to/kernel/source && make SUBDIRS=/path/to/source/addonmodule/ modules
obj-m := addonmodule.o
