(which says tabs are always 8 chars)
I always have my tabs at 8. People who choose to use a different
tabsize are able to read my sources without any ill effects. It costs
an occasional few bytes (as in the example above), but makes the
sources read much better (also under different circumstances).
If you assume "tabs-are-8" and allow yourself to work from that, it is
allowed to start a line with 8 spaces too. Which looks bad in patches:
  	a += 2;
  	b += 2;
+         c += 2;
  	d += 2;
  	e += 2;
Note patch's two spaces at the beginning of every line with a tab
behind it. The "added" line ("c += 2;") has 8 spaces (and "+ " from
patch).
I recommend that everyone be as careful as possible about spaces/tabs.
A small effort if split among all kernel programmers.
