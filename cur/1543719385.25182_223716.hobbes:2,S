One exception is the x86 tlb flush code, thus my patch is wrong. We 
could add nonatomic __cpu_set and __cpu_clear bitops, but I'm not sure 
if it's worth the effort, cpu bitops aren't that common 
(kernel/rcupdate.c and balance_node could use the __ versions).
Sorry for the noise (and don't check who wrote the x86 tlb flush code)
