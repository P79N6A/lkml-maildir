In the copy loop,
+#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT
+               if ( (i%64)==0 ) {
+                   MMX_RESTORE;
+                   MMX_SAVE;
+               };
+#endif
It costs several hundred clocks (wow) every 4KB copy.
It kills throughput but it makes the low latency people smile.
So I make two APIs. 
__copy_user_zeroing_nocache()
__copy_user_zeroing_inatomic_nocache()
The former is a low latency version and the other is a throughput version.
What do you think?
Regards,
  Hiro
