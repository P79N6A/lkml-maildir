It comes back with a command prompt. trying a "simple command... ps, ls
it does not return. The hard disks(hardware raid) light up. But it seems
like noone is home.
It doesn't oops in the 2.4.1-pre11 or 10.
That is a good thing.

Unusable how? Does it hang or oops? Does nmi and up/smp make any
differences in 2.4.1-preXX?
I did some fixes for cpq after the blk merge in 2.4.1-pre, and got
reports that it works. However, I don't have the necessary hardware
to test myself.
