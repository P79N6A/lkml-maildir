fortunately with the patch applied your box works now (so does mine) so
the bug appears to be fixed.
early-bootup debugging was never easy, and breakage there doesnt happen
all that often. Hopefully this was the last one related to remove-BKL. 
(If such a early-bootup lockup happens in the future then you sure could
temporarily unplug the ups serial connection and use that as the serial
console - for the narrow and temporary purpose of debugging that
boot-time hang.)
