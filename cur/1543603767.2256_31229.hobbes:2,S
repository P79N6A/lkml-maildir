This is exactly the kind of thinking that brought us pci_pool.
With all due respect to David-B, it was totally unnecessary,
in my view. However, attempts to make it "pretty" resulted in
something that cannot be implemented right. Just think if
pci_pool_free can be entered from an interrupt. If you allow
that, you cannot free full pages (because some broken architectures
implement pci_alloc_consistent with vmalloc, and vfree is not
interrupt safe). The root of the problem is an attempt to specify
variable sized pools.
I am afraid that if we start adding first class citizen APIs
in the area of pci_alloc_something, it's going to be more and
more interdependent and will place very strong constraints
on what architectures can and cannot do. For example, already
pci_alloc_consistent _cannot_ be implemented on some HP machines
(and, by extension, pci_pool).

And it neither of these is possible, then what? Then you fall
back on the most generic code, which is the worst case of
all possible partial implementations in drivers.
