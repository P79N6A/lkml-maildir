Hm. Again we have the question of whether to export 'threshold_pct' vs.
'threshold_abs', or whether to have a separate string property which
says what the 'unit' of the threshold is. I don't care much -- I'll do
whatever DavidZ prefers.
The git tree now has support for battery information available from the
PMU on Apple laptops. I _really_ don't like the way I have to register a
fake platform_device just to be able to get sensible attribute
callbacks. I suspect it should go back to being a class_device and we
should fix the class_device attribute functions. Greg?
