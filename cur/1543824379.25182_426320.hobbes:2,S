Andrew,
taskstats, Balbir'r approach, is too specific and doesn't work for me.
It is by design limited to per-task data.
My statistics code is not limited to per-task statistics, but allows exploiters
to have data been accumulated and been shown for whatever entity they need to,
may it be for tasks, for SCSI disks, per adapter, per queue, per interface,
for a device driver, etc.
If you want me to change my code to use netlink anyway, I might be able to
implement my own genetlink family. I haven't look at the details of that yet.
