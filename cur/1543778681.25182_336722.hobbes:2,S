The current SiS driver is way more readable than the previous version
but I still have not finished to revamp its mii/phy init sequence:
- it's a bit ad hoc;
- it duplicates code here and there (see link timer and mii/phy init);
- imnsho, it tries to achieve too much work in the pci probe phase;
- it mostly ignores what is available in include/linux/mii.h and
  drivers/net/mii.c.
Expect something to test before the end of the week.
