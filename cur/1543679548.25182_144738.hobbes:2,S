Thanks for doing these.

Can you please describe your experiences? The more feedback I get the more I 
can get it working well.

Ok well here is my summary of the situation. My patch has virtually no effect 
on contest results (except perhaps io_other). This is good because my earlier 
attempts did affect it, and possibly starved some of the loads. Dare I say 
it, contest is not very good at picking up _these_ sort of scheduler tweaks 
unless they do something wrong. Sorry if my system responsiveness benchmark 
doesn't show this effect; I think they're different. This is more about 
picking the right thing to give preference to. There's a long discussion in 
that, but I'll try not to get into it.
By the way it doesn't look like your dbench in dbench load actually worked.
O1int still remains a work in progress.
