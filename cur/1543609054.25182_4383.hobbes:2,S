Hi,
the discussion is irrelevant. Despite what everybody thinks, Linus thinks 
/proc must be not binary, so it will stay that way for those of us who run 
Linus kernels...
I can inmagine people like Alan ignoring this discussion after such a 
statement, the outcome of the discussion is irrelevant for the kernel 
development.
