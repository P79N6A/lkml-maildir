I've often felt that a /proc or /sys interface to allow blacklist
additions or quirk addition would be great.
Hacking of new devices often runs faster than distro's kernel releases;
it will often be very simple to distribute a 1 liner to make some
hardware available than tell people to wait until the next major release
of their distro.
As a point in instance, a couple of years ago I gave up trying to get
some quirks added for usb dual and quad joystick adaptors. I got them
added for one of them but not the other. It was just too much hard work.
I will say for the record that you, Greg, were very helpful, but all
told it was a couple of hours to build and test each quirk patch (I
didn't get the controllers at the same time), and then knowing that I
would either have to maintain my own out-of-distro kernel or wait about
18 months for my distro to get the patch - meant that the work was not
solving any immediate problem; so the pay-off in relation to the
scarcity of my time meant it just got forgotten.
An user-space post-boot uploadable quirk/blacklist would be great and
IMHO result in a bigger supply of quirks.
