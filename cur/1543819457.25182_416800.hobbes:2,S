it's not quite as simple. You can't know if it's a gpl violation,
because they could have shipped the source to the people who bought it.
(for embedded stuff with a disk on it, like most printer controllers,
it's easy to just put the source on that disk with the binary and
satisfy the gpl)
If they did not ship the source they need to ship a written offer that
is valid for *everyone* not just the people they gave the binary to.
