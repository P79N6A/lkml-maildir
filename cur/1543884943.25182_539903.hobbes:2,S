But is there really a need for this except to avoid the above-mentioned 
deadlock?
As I'm not too up to date with all the possibilities the servers and GL 
clients may be using shared buffers,
I need some enlightenment :). Could we have an example, please?

This is getting closer and closer to a GPU scheduler, an interesting 
topic indeed.
Perhaps we should have a separate  discussion on the  needs and 
requirements for such a thing?
