   I'm not going to take this directly, but if it passes muster with David, 
   I'm happy.  The fewer locking primitives we need, the better, and brlocks 
   have had enough problems that I wouldn't mind getting rid of them.
I'm fine with it, as long as I get shown how to get the equivalent
atomic sequence using the new primitives.  Ie. is there still a way
to go:
	stop_all_incoming_packets();
	do_something();
	resume_all_incoming_packets();
with the new stuff?
