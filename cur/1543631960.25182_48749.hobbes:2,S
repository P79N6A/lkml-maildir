Well, in that case is there some kind of bk or command that can be
made to automagically run to purge white-space from the end
patches/changesets as they are produced?  It would also be nice to
have hunks such as[1]:

stripped completely as they have no functional value and just add
bloat patches and such like.
This can be done with CVS but as it works very differently to bk
(which to be honest I really don't understand very well at all) I'm
not even sure if the above suggestion is meaningful.
