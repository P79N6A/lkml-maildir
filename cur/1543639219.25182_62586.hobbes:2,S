Is there a way to tell which module it is that is setting the taint flag?
I can load each module one by one and check after each if the taint flag
is set, but
I just need to know how to tell it is set.
Once I can do that (assuming it's a module I can live without) I will
duplicate from cold boot.
Thank you.
