if that's your concern, we can easily fix this by still moving min/max
to its same form.
#define type_min(type,x,y) \
        ({ type __x = (x), __y = (y); __x < __y ? __x: __y; })
#define type_max(type,x,y) \
        ({ type __x = (x), __y = (y); __x > __y ? __x: __y; })
#define min(x,y) type_min(typeof(x),x,y)
#define max(x,y) type_max(typeof(x),x,y)
no _implicit_ cast and ...

... joy, we would even know which one.
