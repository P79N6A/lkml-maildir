Touchy we are I see. Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not interested
in stealing anyone's show.  I've got my own workload thank you very
much.

Objections have been voiced. Go back and read earlier postings.

Sorry, but go back and check who's asking for ASAP. Then go back a
few e-mails and read back what I said:

Certainly you realize that "backing off" and "thinking" have little
to do with any sort of "rush".

So in your opinion, we should all put our brains on idle until someone
posts a patch containing the words "please apply"?
Understand that I've got no inclination to going into a flamewar.
I just made some rearrangement suggestion and all hell broke loose
with people retreating to their defense positions reiterating
POVs that had little to do with what I was suggesting.
You can disagree with what I'm saying, but please read the previous
posts for context and don't put words in my mouth that I haven't said.
