i was in the fedora Core 4 test 2
on the installation ,i forget to install the legency network
then  i realize that telnet is needed ,
so i seek the pakadge containing telnet and xinetd ,then install them.
but ,always ,in the setup
i cannot let telnetd be selected, 
when i try to start it  using telnetd....
then error evolves like this: 
telnetd:get peername:socket operation on non-socket
