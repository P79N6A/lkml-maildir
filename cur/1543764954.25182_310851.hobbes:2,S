I'm currently using a 2.6.10 kernel (on a Debian Sarge, i386).
I've compiled a 2.6.11.5 and a 2.6.11.7 kernels and my keyboard (a
sweex SILVER MULTIMEDIA KEYBOARD, SW-23 -- PS/2 105 keys -- a
classical keyboard) doesn't work with these kernels.
I asked for help and one said me it is probably a bug in the kernel
since a normal keyboard must always work with the kernel.
I can give more informations if you need, say me.
Please send a copy of your replies, I'm not a subscriber for this list.
P.S.: English is not my native language, I'm doing the best I can. :)
Bye.
