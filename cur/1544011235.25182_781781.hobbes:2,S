I don't see it being easier for drivers, you should provide this kind of
infrastructure within your framework already.
Actually, we already do provide this kind of framework, what's wrong
with using "struct device" for this, like the rest of the kernel does?
That is the device you need to be doing the reference counting and
release code for, it is exactly what it is there for.
So why is V4L different than the rest of the kernel in that it wishes to
do things differently?
