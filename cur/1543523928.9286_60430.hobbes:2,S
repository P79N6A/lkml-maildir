It appears to be undocumented, or possibly SVR4 reverted this behavior.  
Back when I herded SVR3.[12] systems, EAGAIN could be produced by just about 
any system call that encountered a "transient out of resources" condition in 
the kernel; this wasn't always documented in affected system calls, but was 
at the time documented in intro(2).
Solaris appears to use EAGAIN only for "out of processes/LWPs" according to 
its intro(2), so either it or SVR4 in general appears to have moved away 
from that behavior.  I don't see any equivalents to the SVR3 EAGAIN behavior 
in its intro(2); maybe SVR4 puts the process to sleep until there are 
sufficient resources?

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
