Wait, does that mean the default HZ is going to be changed in the 2.6.x
timeframe?  That's a big user-visible regression, as it makes the
sleep() resolution worse, and would force apps with tight timing
requirements to go back to using the RTC like on 2.4.
Unless, of course, the plan is to merge the high-res timers patch at the
same time.
