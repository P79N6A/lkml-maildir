   email from "Wed Jan 21" says:
   "FTQ stands for Flow Through Queue and they are used to connect different
   state machines. It turns out that it should also be unnecessary to reset
   the FTQs as they get reset during GRC reset. While the FTQ reset itself
   is harmless, we recently discovered that it created a race condition
   with ASF firmware...."
A fix for this mentioned ASF race is in the current 2.4.x
and 2.6.x tg3 drivers.
