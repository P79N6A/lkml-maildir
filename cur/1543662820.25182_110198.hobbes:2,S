Yeah, a closer look shows that the exit path doesn't actually take the
task lock at all around any of the signal stuff, so the lock protects
"task->mm", "task->files" and "task->fs", but it does NOT protect
"task->signal" or "task->sighand" (illogical, but true).
Oh, damn.
The core that checks for "p->sighand" takes the tasklist lock for this
reason (see "collect_sigign_sigcatch()"
So the choice seems to be either:
 - make the exit path hold the task lock over the whole exit path, not 
   just over mm exit.
 - take the "tasklist_lock" over more of "task_sig()" (not just the 
   collect_sigign_sigcatch() thing, but the "&p->signal->shared_pending"  
   rendering too.
The latter is a two-liner. The former is the "right thing" for multiple 
reasons.
The reason I'd _like_ to see the task lock held over _all_ of the fields
in the exit() path is:
 - right now we actually take it and drop it multiple times in exit. See 
   __exit_files(), __exit_fs(), __exit_mm(). Which all take it just to 
   serialize setting ot "mm/files/fs" to NULL.
 - task_lock is a nice local lock, no global scalability impact.
So it really would be much nicer to do something like this in do_exit():
	struct mm_struct *mm;
	struct files_struct *files;
	struct fs_struct *fs;
	struct signal_struct *signal;
	struct sighand_struct *sighand;
	task_lock(task);
	mm = task->mm;
	files = task->files;
	fs = task->fs;
	signal = task->signal;
	sighand = task->sighand;
	task->mm = NULL;
	task->files = NULL;
	task->fs = NULL;
	task->signal = NULL;
	task->sighand = NULL;
	task_unlock(task);
	.. actually do the "__exit_mm(task, mm)" etc here ..
which would make things a lot more readable, and result in us taking the
lock only _once_ instead of three times, and would properly protect
"signal" and "sighand" so that the /proc code wouldn't need to take the
heavily used "tasklist_lock" just to read the signal state for a single
task.
But fixing up exit to do the above would require several (trivial) calling 
convention changes, like changing 
	static inline void __exit_mm(struct task_struct * tsk)
	{
	        struct mm_struct *mm = tsk->mm;
		...
into
	static inline void __exit_mm(struct task_struct * tsk,
			struct mm_struct *mm)
	{
		...
instead and updatign the callers. 
Is anybody willing to do that (hopefully fairly trivial) fixup and test
it, or should we go with the stupid "take the 'tasklist_lock'" approach?
