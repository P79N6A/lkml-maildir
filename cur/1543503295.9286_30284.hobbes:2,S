You're assuming that everybody will know that you are supposed to have a
mime card thingy at the bottom of all your email.
Impersonators don't have to be perfect - the goal is to make people
believe they are who they say they are. Or probably in this case, just to
be curious enough to read the message where they may otherwise just trash
it.
