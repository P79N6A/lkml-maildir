    Hello
    I have a Compaq Proliant DL-380 running kernel 2.2.20+freeswan 1.94
    We need a gigabit ethernet card, and NC6136 works in RedHat 7.1... 
but NOT in 2.2.20
    Can I "backport" this nic driver to kernel 2.2.20?
    If somebody can help me with this issue... I am newbie in kernel 
hacking....
   
    If somebody could send me a patch....
    Greetings from Seville (Spain)!
