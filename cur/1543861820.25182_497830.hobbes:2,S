Probably we can do this, or that. In any case we need changes, that
was my point.
And the best change I believe is to _remove_ CPU_DEAD handling from
workqueue.c as I suggested before. This kthread_stop() is not a good
idea per se, it calls wake_up_process(), but we should in fact use
wake_up(&cwq->more_work). Yes, work->func() should be ready for the
false wakeups, but still.
But for now I hope the last "draft" patch is enough. I'll continue
on next weekend.
Oleg.
