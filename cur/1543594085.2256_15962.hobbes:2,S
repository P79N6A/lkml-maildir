Hi great David;
Normally I would have just ignored your mail but one of your so great
points seems to fit with one of my recent post (perhaps you thought about
others) and I would like to give you my opinion about it.

I've recently send two mails about the isp2200 qlogic driver (qlogicfc)
included in the kernel. 
Two facts:
The qlogicfc driver in the kernel is outdated. Qlogic provides a newer one.
The main difference is that qlogic disable the IP support for an unknown
reason. The IP support is a usefull feature but the status of this driver
is IMHO "broken".
I think we should replace it by the newer from qlogic or remove it.
The only thing that the IP feature does it to influence customers to buy
the qlogic card for a feature which reveals to be not available when you
start using it. That's what I've done and I know that I'm not the only one.
It's interesting to know that this "IP over FC" feature is provided by
other cards.
From a more general point of view. I fully disagree with your "only code
matters" approch. I strongly believe in the Free Software goal and It seems
to be the case of many linux kernel hackers. The kernel must IMHO be DFSG
compliant.
