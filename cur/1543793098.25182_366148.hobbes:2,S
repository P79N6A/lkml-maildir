About the locking first,
So, there's one part that I was a little worried about, where
it does this in a couple places:
        c = (ctlr_info_t **) &scsicmd->device->host->hostdata[0];
(gets our adapter structure by following pointers in the scsi
command)
So, if that pointer chain can change suddenly, then my code is bad.
Can doing "echo scsi remove-single-device . . . > /proc/scsi/scsi"
cause that pointer chain to break?  I noticed I can yank a disk
out from under a mounted filesystem with 
"echo scsi remove-single-device"  It wasn't obvious to me whether
doing that would affect that pointer chain though, though I could
imagine it might.
Or am I barking up the wrong tree worrying about 
the scsicmd->device->host->hostdata pointer chain
getting yanked out from under me?
Apart from possibly the two places where I do that, 
I think it's ok.
About the CONFIG_CISS_SCSI_TAPE, we can change that, although
it's been that way for years, and was following the 
BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA which was there since the drivers inception.
Does it unnecessarily break people's existing .config files?
(not badly of course.)

Two comments:
1) CONFIG_CISS_SCSI_TAPE should be CONFIG_CCISS_SCSI_TAPE, IMO
2) is any locking needed in your scsi eh reset handlers?  recent kernels 
eliminate the lock that's been traditionally held around the handlers.
