Hi,
the following could explain Ooops reports which
BUG_ON(page->pte.chain != NULL) and possibly others. The kernel I'm
talking about is 2.5.31+akpm-everything.gz but others might be
affected as well:
Summary: Don't try to work with page_count == 0. 
	 Don't hold references to a page that don't count towards
	 the page count.
Processor 1                            Processor 2
refill_inactive grabs a page with      
page_count == 1 from the lru.
                                       __pagevec_release tries to release
					 the same page with page_count == 1
					 and does put_page_test_zero
					 bringing the page_count to 0
					 (No spinlocks involved!)
				       Interrupt or preempt or something
					 else that gives the other processor
					 some time.
refill_inactive calls page_cache_get
bringing the page_count back to 1
(this should ring some alarm bells)
refill_inactive continues all the way
down until it calls __pagevec_release
itself.
__pagevec_release calls put_page_test_zero
bringing the count back to 0
      Both processors succeeded in bringing the page_count to zero,
      i.e. both processors will add the page to their own
      pages_to_free_list.
actually frees the page and reallocates
it to a new process which immediatly
sets page->pte.chain to something useful.
                                          actully frees the page and sees
                                          BUGs on page->pte.chain beeing
					  non zero.
Depending on what the new process does with the page this may also
explain other Ooopses on one of the BUGs in free_pages_ok as well.
Also it probably isn't necessarily a pagevec only BUG. I think
__page_cache_release has very much the same Problem:
Processor 1                               Processor 2
page_cache_release frees a page
still on a lru list brining the
page count to to 0.
   => Interrupt to make the timeing
      possible
                                          Grabs page from lru list
					  and temporarily increments
					  page_count back to 1.
BUG_ON(page_count(page) != 0)
in __page_cache_release.
I don't have a fix but I think the only real solution is to
increment the page count if a page is on a lru list. After all
this is a reference to the page.
     regards    Christian Ehrhardt
