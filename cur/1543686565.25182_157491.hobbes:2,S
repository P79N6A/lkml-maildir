I don't see where you are getting this from.  Define
  F(x) = first80bits(SHA(x))
  G(x) = first80bits(SHA(x)) xor last80bits(SHA(x)).
What makes you think that F is a better (or worse) hash function than G?
I think there is little basis for discriminating between them.
If SHA is cryptographically secure, both F and G are fine.
If SHA is insecure, then all bets are off, and both F and G might be weak.
