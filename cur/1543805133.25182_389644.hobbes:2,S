FYI, I have this being used in Ubuntu's kernel right now. It's pretty
stable. I have it implemented for x86_64 aswell. I can send you that
patch when I get a chance to pull it from the repo cleanly. I did enable
a kconfig option and command line option so it can be enabled/disabled
by default and also at boot.
