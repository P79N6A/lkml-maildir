Phew.  Sometimes I come off poorly, and people flip out.  I hate that.

Hmm, there have been some recently (I think) for the 2.2.16 kernels.  I've
not kept up on my testing (no time), so I'm still running 2.2.14.

True enough, it's out of date.  I'm going to try to get Jacob to point to my
FAQ, but I haven't gotten enough feedback just yet.

There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.  :-)  Amongst the other
45 kernel compiles I've got to do this week, I'll try to find some time to
look at the 2.2.16 patch, and see if it works nicely with Ingo's RAID patch
on my system.

Sorry, I can't fix that.  I just help put the HOWTOs online, I don't write
them (at least not much).

In that case, you need to patch your kernel.  :)  I think you mentioned that
you'd already found the 2.2.16 patch, so run with that, and see what
happens.

D'uh, I'll look and see what it does for me, and report back.  Probably NOT
tomorrow, but some time this week.  Maybe somebody else will step forward
with results before I get to it.

I dunno, the kernel list just scares me.  There's too much extraneous stuff
that goes through there anyway, and 90% of it is over my head.  Speaking of
which, I'll trim them from the list, after this email (since somebody there
might have tried more patches than myself).

Ah, sorry about that one, it might have been a little out of line.  However,
do get yourself a test box, doesn't even need to be the same hardware, just
something that you can break.

It seemed good to me, but I've already read everything that I've been
looking for.  :-)  From aforementioned FAQ:
   1.1. Where can I find archives for the linux-raid mailing list?
   My favorite archives are at Geocrawler.
   
http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/Linux/57/0/
   Other archives are available at
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-raid&r=1&w=2
   Another archive site is

Sure, it's on it's way (although you can read it from the archives too).
I've got a place to host it, time to finish it has been the issue.  :-)  It
will be online by the weekend, unless we have a meltdown in the server room
at work.  HTH,
	Greg
