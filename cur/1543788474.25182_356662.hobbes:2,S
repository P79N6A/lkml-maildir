Which task(s)? Both the one doing the check, and the one on whose behalf the
check is done?

But you don't know the key serial number at that point, hence why I added the
second hook. I'll drop the second. I can always bring it back later.

I don't know. As far as I know, setxattr and co can be used to set and
retrieve security data on files. I thought it would be desirable to have
similar for keys. If not, I can remove both calls/hooks for the time being.
