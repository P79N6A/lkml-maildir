You are correct :-)
pre3-4 fixed it , I'll be trying the pre3-[56] patches too today.
on a sidenote - i had the "nocheck" option in my /etc/fstab (after
reading about it on lkml yesterday)
and it worked fine with pre2, with this pre3-4 it won't remount
read/write on my redhat system, it says something
about invalid mount option, did it get removed perhaps ?
