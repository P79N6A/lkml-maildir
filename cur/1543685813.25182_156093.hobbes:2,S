Here too.
You know, that SCHED_SOFTRR is almost sounding like it
should be a SCHED_RESERVED where you could specify a
quantity of CPU time reserved for each task in
SCHED_RESERVED individually rather like isochronous which
was brought up earlier by Con.  Of course you'd have to make
sure some time was unreservable.
