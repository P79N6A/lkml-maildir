It is not the recommended form for Athlons (see my other mail) 
But I doubt it's a big issue. The Athlon has a pretty good decoder.

64bit mode needs it special cased anyways because the common
xchg ax,ax nop would not be a nop (it would zero extend the register to
64bit)

P3 should be fine now.

CONFIG_X86_SSE2 is a nop now yes. But it does not matter because 
the user cannot set it directly. I can remove it in a followup patch.
I'm thinking of using it for the prefetches in the future
I wrote prefetch using versions of these for 64bit and it
helps, so it may make sense to port it over.
I also experiemented with replacing the local_irq_restore with
an P4 optimized version (bt $9,oldflags ; jnc 1f ; sti ; 1: instead
of pushl oldflags ; popfl) which is 60cycles -> 47cycles, but I ran
into weird binutils problems and it bloated the code quite a lot
(2 bytes -> 7 bytes) for only a few cycles so I dropped it again.
But please put the first version of the patch in first so that
we get the infrastructure for future work.
