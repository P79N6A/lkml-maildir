First of all, some of that stuff should not be used in kernel headers
and getting a warning about such uses is a Good Thing(tm).  What's
more, some are actively *wrong* for kernel - __STDC_HOSTED__, for one,
is simply a lie.  And no, sparse (or any other C compiler) is not
required to have the same pile as gcc does.
There's another reason why limited subset is good - it documents the
subset we are using.  And having to reach gcc source just to figure
out which architectures might have given symbol...  No, thanks.
