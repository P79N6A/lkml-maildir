Rasmus, thanks of course, but this idea _only_ makes sense if you produce
a big patch that includes _all_ filesystems and the actual VFS interface
to them. Doing individual filesystems, in this case, is no use at all -
your patches cannot be applied gradually.
To be more blatant, the patch you sent me "breaks" bfs because it won't
compile anymore... see what I am saying?
