O.K., I'll try to show some of the interesting aspects of LXD.
LXD intends to be a documentation system for large open source
projects. Its main objective is to gather high level information that
cannot be extracted from the source files.
The main strengths of LXD are:
    * Documentation is separated from source files:
        - High level information usually does not fit in a unique
source file (e.g.
          subsystem description).
        - Source code is more readable without big blocks of comments.
    * Documentation files have a well defined XML structure.
        - Provides developers a clear view of what has to be documented and how.
        - Documentation can be edited using standard XML editors.
        - It can be obtained lots of human readable documentation
formats (LaTeX, HTML, ...)
          from XML documents.
        - Documentation can be independent from programming language.
My initial idea of LXD is a system composed by the XML documents
definitions and a set of tools to ease the management of XML
documentation. To simplify the problem, the first approach will be
focused on projects written in C language. As I said in my previous
post, there is a presentation of the project at
http://lxd.sourceforge.net/.
The main aspects that I expect to discuss for user requirements
analysis are the XML documents definitions and also useful tools for
this system.
Best regards,
