That definitely wants fixing.  Since I like doing resets and similar 
slow-paths in process context -- sleep for as long as you want -- I 
would say kick over to a function called via schedule_task()
Just make sure other parts of the driver that may be called 
asynchronously, such as ethtool ioctls, are disabled.  Remember that 
tx_timeout holds the dev->xmit_lock as well, so spending a long time in 
there is a bad idea in general.
I would probably call netif_carrier_off() first thing in tx_timeout, too.
