embedding the info shouldnt be /that/ hard in case of the SLAB: if the 
memleak info is at a negative offset from the allocated pointer. I.e. 
that if kmalloc() returns 'ptr', the memleak info could be at 
ptr-sizeof(memleak_info). That way you dont have to know the size of the 
object beforehand and there's absolutely no need for a global hash of 
any sort.
(it gets a bit more complex for page aligned allocations for the buddy 
and for vmalloc - but that could be solved by adding one extra pointer 
into struct page. That is a far more preferable cost than the 
locking/cache overhead of a global hash.)
