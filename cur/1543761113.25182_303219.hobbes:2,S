You still haven't answered my question.  My observation was that
only the class code can in any sense be called "new" ... so your
blanket statement seemed to overlook several essential points!
Which parts of the driver model were you thinking of?
That pre-driver model stuff went away in maybe 2.6.5 or so, I
forget just when.  If you think those changes can easily be
reversed, I suggest you think again ... they enabled a LOT of
likewise-overdue cleanups.  And they only affected the case of
drivers that bound to multiple interfaces, gettng rid of a
funky "half bound" state and making it look like the primary
case (drivers binding to one interface at a time), which has
been working since 2.5.early.
It's been a long slog to get to a usb core that's a good
match to the relatively complex requirements of USB.  With a
few notable exceptions (like PM non-support for wakeup events
and for selective suspend, and strange locking side effects),
converting to the driver model has been a win at every step
of the way.  It's gone both ways; the driver core has changed
to work better with USB too.
