It could provide a very low voltage and current, just enough to probe the resistor but not enough to actually power anything on the card.

I think that's just a warning that the supply pins need to be grounded when power is disabled. I have a controller where they are left floating, and some cards do indeed power up using power from the data line pull-ups. The end results is a heavily malfunctioning card due to insufficient power supply.
Most of this card detection using DAT3 business is unknown to me. The spec that describes how it is supposed to work is not publicly available, so I can only speculate.
