Hi,
this is a basically a resend of the driver core patches I already sent
on Nov 14. (They are needed as a base for the s390 cio patches of that
patchset which still are in -mm.)
Patch 1 is unchanged, patch 2 now also contains the KOBJ_MOVE uevent
which will be generated when a kobject has been moved (and a small fix
for !CONFIG_SYSFS).
[1/2] Introduce device_find_child().
[2/2] Introduce device_move(): move a device to a new parent.
Patches are again against 2.6.19-rc5-mm2.
