your question is answered in 
http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/pax.txt
that i suggested you to read over a year ago. the short answer is
that it's not only about stack overflows but any kind of memory
corruption bugs, and you need both a properly configured kernel
(for PaX/i386 that would be SEGMEXEC/MPROTECT/NOELFRELOCS) and an
access control system (to take care of the file system and file
mappings) and a properly prepared userland (e.g., no text relocations
in ELF executables/libs, which is a good thing anyway).
