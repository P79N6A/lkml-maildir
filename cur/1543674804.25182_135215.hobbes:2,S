Grr... init_netlink(), that is.

After looking at the code in question, I _really_ doubt that other initcalls
might rely on it.  It does
	* register character device
	* create a /dev/netlink (on devfs) and a bunch of entries there.
That's it.  Unless we have some initcall code that cares to mount devfs
and open files on it (or does such mknod on rootfs and opens the result)...
