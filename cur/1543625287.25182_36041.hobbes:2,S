And you patched samba, enabled unicode with the unicode flag and set the
"codepage" to be unicode?

Ok, that's good. Should help reproducing this.

So, windows is being sensitive ...

Since the unicode test gave the same results it might be useful to compare
how smbfs does the file listing with how a windows box requests. One way
to do that is to get a network trace of both and then compare them.
It's not really a test and if I can reproduce this I could do it myself.
Give me a day or so ...
If you want to do this, go to www.ethereal.com and get the latest version.
It has a nice gtk interface and it will decode most of the common SMB
requests for you.
(You may want to limit the trace of smbfs to port 139, win2k may also use 
 445)
