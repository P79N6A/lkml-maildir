The current approach is to rely on symbols being proper resolved but binutils
are playing tricks and does not always provide info to resolve static symbols.
Originally I thought this was pure inlining issues but it seems to be more than
that.
But introducing a special section just to say "references to .init.text" is OK
seems like a bit of overengineering to me.
I will give it a try during the coming week.
