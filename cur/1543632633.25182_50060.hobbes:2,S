No. I think that in the long run we really would want all of the writeback
preallocation should happen in the "struct file", not in "struct inode".
And they should be released at file close ("release()"), not at iput()
time.
I _think_ that right now nfsd doesn't cache file opens (only inodes), so
this could be a performance issue for nfsd, but it might be possible to
change how nfsd acts. And it would be a _lot_ cleaner to do it at the file
level.
