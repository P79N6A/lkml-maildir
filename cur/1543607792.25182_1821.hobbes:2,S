I haven't tried the patched version of the LTP tests yet.
This is with 2.4.14-pre3aa4.
Summary:
mtest01
2.4.14-pre3	Elapsed (wall clock) time:          30.517
2.4.14-pre3aa2	Elapsed (wall clock) time:          65.176
2.4.14-pre3aa4	Elapsed (wall clock) time:          37.277
mmap001
2.4.14-pre3	Elapsed (wall clock seconds) time:  171.45
2.4.14-pre3aa2	terminated with signal 9 
2.4.14-pre3aa4	Elapsed (wall clock seconds) time:  170.47
2.4.14-pre3 had the best interactive feel and mp3 sound.
Test:	"mtest01 -p 80" -w and "mmap001 -m 500000"
	Play mp3 sampled at 128k with mp3blaster.
	Light bitchx use (2 sessions), lynx, 52k link to net.
	vmstat 8, iostat 10, no X.  (typical load for these tests).
	Change page-cluster from default (3) to 2.
2.4.14pre3aa4 page-cluster=3
mp3 played 275 seconds of 373 second run.
