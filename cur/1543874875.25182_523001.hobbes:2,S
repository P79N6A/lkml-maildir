Yes. Since this comes from Mac world, it definitely makes sense to add 
CONFIG_MAC_CODEPAGE_DEFAULT, the corresponding module parameter, and make 
hfs (FIXME: anything else?) use this. However, I have no hfs filesystems, 
and thus can't test my changes.
Help from anyone who understands hfs code is welcome. In particular, what 
currently happens by default WRT the codepage? Where is the code responsible 
for this?
