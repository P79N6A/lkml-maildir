Okay,  So install a *slower* disk, and you'll see that
number drop dramatically, to perhaps 15-20%.  That is because
the overall elapsed time will increase, "reducing" the percentage
of CPU spent doing I/O, even though the total CPU utilization for
I/O remains unchanged (and quite small).  Get it now?
