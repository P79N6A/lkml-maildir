I don't get it.
If you say that IDE disables interrupts during init, does that mean that
it disables _all_ interrupts or just that you mask the IDE IRQs?
Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of SCSI bus scan, because
the Linux IDE reset is already barely noticeable.
Does "timing sensitive" mean "don't come again too early" or "be 100%
punctual"?
There ought to be _some_ initializations that don't require interrupts?
Registering the file systems and network protocols, stuff like that?
Felix
