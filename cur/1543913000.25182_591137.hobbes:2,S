No, way to much work for one stinking LED.
Also there is existing application support for legacy LED_MAIL through
input subsystem, and no application support for mail led through LED
subsystem.

No, this drivers mapping table is from bits to key codes, not scan codes to keycodes.
Each key is a bit in the scan code, so hitting A and B key generates
scancode of : 0xC = 0x4 | 0x8.
get/setkeycode is designed for keyboards where each key generates different
unique code.

New version of  driver has to use input_polled_dev->private directly.
