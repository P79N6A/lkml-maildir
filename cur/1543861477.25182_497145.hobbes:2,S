That would be OK in theory, so I just tried it.
I don't get the same object files produced with an inline function
(for arch/i386/math-emu/fpu_etc.o), so I don't feel that it's quite
as safe without digging deeping into the .o file and its changes.
The 3 other .o files that use setcc() were the same when using
the inline patch version.

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
setcc() in math-emu is written as a gcc extension statement expression
macro that returns a value.  However, it's not used that way and it's
not needed like that, so just make it a do-while non-extension macro
so that we don't use an extension when it's not needed.
