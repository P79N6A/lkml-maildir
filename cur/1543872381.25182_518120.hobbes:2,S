Sorry, not intentionally. Maybe it slipped because I haven't seen much res mgmt
related patches from Linux Vserver on lkml recently. Note that I -did- talk 
about VServer at one point in past (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/06/15/112
)!

so tasks sharing the same nsproxy->pid_ns is the fundamental unit of
resource management (as far as vserver/container goes)?

Isn't that made simple because of the fact that we have pointers to
namespace objects (and not actual objects themselves) in nsproxy?
I mean, all that is required to manage multiple nsproxy's
is to have the pointer to the same resource object in all of them.
In system call terms, if someone does a unshare of uts namespace, he
will get into a new nsproxy object sure (which has a pointer to the new
uts namespace) but the new nsproxy object will still be pointing to the
old resource controlling objects.

That would be the simplest, agreeably. But not optimal in terms of
storage?
Pls note that task-movement can be not-so-infrequent (in other words,
frequent) in context of non-container workload management.

Ease of use maybe. Scripts can be more readily used with a fs-based
interface.
