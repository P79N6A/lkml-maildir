Certainly not a problem on x86.
But, never mind hugetlb, you still not quite convinced me that there's
no problem at all with get_user_pages find_extend_vma growing on ia64.
I repeat that ia64_do_page_fault has REGION tests to guard against
expanding either kind of stack across into another region.  ia64_brk,
ia64_mmap_check and arch_get_unmapped_area have RGN_MAP_LIMIT checks.
But where is the equivalent paranoia when ptrace calls get_user_pages
calls find_extend_vma?
If your usual stacks face each other across the same region, they're
not going to pose problem.  But what if someone mmaps MAP_GROWSDOWN
near the base of a region, then uses ptrace to touch an address near
the top of the region below?
