The fundamental point I'm making is people shouldn't go around taking
changes randomly from maintainers trees, and believing that they know
far better than the maintainer what they're doing, especially when they
don't have the hardware to even try it out, and go submitting these
changes to Linus without even asking about it first...  after the
maintainer has been very careful and explicitly not submitted
the change because they have very good reasons not to.
What if I were to take, say, Mochel's experimental tree and send some
random alpha code to Linus?  Let anarchy rule!
