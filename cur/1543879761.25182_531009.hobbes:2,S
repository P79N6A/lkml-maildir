I obviously agree, but I will also add that one of the most motivating 
things there *is* in open source is "personal pride".
It's a really good thing, and it means that if somebody shows that your 
code is flawed in some way (by, for example, making a patch that people 
claim gets better behaviour or numbers), any *good* programmer that 
actually cares about his code will obviously suddenly be very motivated to 
out-do the out-doer!
Does this mean that there will be tension and rivalry? Hell yes. But 
that's kind of the point. Life is a game, and if you aren't in it to win, 
what the heck are you still doing here?
As long as it's reasonably civil (I'm not personally a huge believer in 
being too polite or "politically correct", so I think the "reasonably" is 
more important than the "civil" part!), and as long as the end result is 
judged on TECHNICAL MERIT, it's all good.
We don't want to play politics. But encouraging peoples competitive 
feelings? Oh, yes.
