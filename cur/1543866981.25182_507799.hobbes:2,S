Subject: Found trivial error in linux-headers-2.6.17-11-generic/include/linux/tty.h

I upgraded the kernel on my Kubuntu 6.10 to 2.6.17-11-generic and had
a lot of trouble compiling my softmodem driver.
Apparently it was, among others, because of a mistake in kernel-headers
this is what I've found in tty.h
$ cat -n /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.17-11-generic/include/linux/tty.h
| grep Define -C 3
    83   */
    84  #define TTY_NORMAL      0
    85  #define TTY_BREAK       1
    86  #Define Tty_Frame       2
    87  #define TTY_PARITY      3
    88  #define TTY_OVERRUN     4
    89
I don't know whether it is Ubuntu-related error, or it came  from the
top, and I wasn't really sure to whom should I address this error
report.
Hope this will help.
Greetings,
