My machine (bp6 celeron dual) has APIC error and strange SCSI
interrups.
I don't know the relations of those.

I have the same APIC error messages as above.
Another problem is on aic7xxx.
/proc/interrupts saids the SCSI driver produces massive interrupts,
about 17000 interrupts per second for each CPU even if no SCSI
devices are attached.
The SCSI I/F(2940UWD) is a dual channel SCSI adaptor, only one of the
channel produces interupts.
This happens on 2.3.25 but not on 2.3.18.
Does anybody tell me a clue?
