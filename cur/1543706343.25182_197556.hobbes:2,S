What are the units? minutes.seconds?
The test is interesting, I'll have to try it. Does it
resemble a workload you're interested in?
It looks like the -mm kernels might have something other
than Nikita's and my VM patches that is affecting times.
Your Load 3 looks quite bad. Does it give decent results?
Is it possibly because the other stuff is getting better
treatment, do you think?
Thanks
