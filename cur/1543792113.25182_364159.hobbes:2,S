Heh!  Take my thoughts and turn them on my head.  Bravo!

So 40 bits is fine for now, but 64 would be great just because it
solves the problem for a long long time?

But aren't there areas where the ISA would expose useful parts of the
underlying microarchitecture that could be more efficiently used in
OSes?

The corollary of course is that if it's excellent but the marketplace
doesn't like it for some reason, we'll still let it go.  I keep
wishing for the Alpha to come back sometimes...  Oh well.
Thanks for your thoughts Linus.
