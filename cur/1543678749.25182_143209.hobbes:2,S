Hi Michael.
I can see that dvb has header files present in:
drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core
The usual rule is that header files used by others shall be
located in include/linux/..., in the dvb case is must be:
include/linux/media/dvb/
Any particular reason to keep them in the dvb-core dir?
hch: Please correct me if I got it wrong with respect to include files.
	Sam
