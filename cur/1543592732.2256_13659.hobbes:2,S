Hi
I am running a Linux machine with a 1GB Ethernet card which takes a huge
amount of packets, which results in many HW interrupts.
is it possible to make sure that only CPU #1 handles all the hardware
interrupts generated by the NIC ? or even all the hardware interrupts in the
systems if its too much to ask to filter IRQ based on origin ?
thanks
Hilik Stein
