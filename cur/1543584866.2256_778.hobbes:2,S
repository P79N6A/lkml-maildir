Hi, 
Recently I read the BeOS www page, and answerd a question in other mailing
list. Both things have remind me of a pretty file system: 'cdfs'.
Anybody knows if there is a port of 'cdfs' (Audio CD File System) for Linux ?
Which fs now in kernel would be good as a template to start ?
I am always looking for something enough easy to start kernel programming,
and this could be a nice start (look, throw away all your ripping soft
and just do a 'cp').
