cc503c1b "x86: PIE executable randomization" doesn't boot on my Ubuntu
Feisty Fawn Intel Core2 system.
I get numerous segfaults before getting a (initramfs) busybox shell. A
similar bug was reported much earlier:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/20/421
Sadly, reverting this (or all of the PIE patches) results in a lot of
conflicts now with git-revert too failing, mainly in
arch/x86/mm/mmap_64.c.
