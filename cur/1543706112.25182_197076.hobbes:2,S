That __attribute__ would have to go with __asm__ - it should tell gcc
that insn has no successors.  And that would be a PITA to deal with
- gcc parser is not a thing of beauty as it is, so changing it would
not be fun.
Easier to express that as an asm constraint - then it will have no impact
on the high-level parser and constraint parser is simple enough...
