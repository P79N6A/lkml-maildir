The patch does only one thing: it instructs the card not to negotiate
full-duplex modes, because (for undocumented and yet unexplained reasons)
full-duplex modes don't work well on this card.
If you had problems before, then their cause is most likely elsewhere.
1-second ping time is definitely wrong.

The thing is, I don't really see any significant differences between the
2.4.4-ac11 driver and the 2.4.5-ac9 driver. I see lots of clean-ups, some
power management stuff, and the half-duplex stuff. None of them should
affect the core functionality directly..
Please do me a favor: comment out the call to set_half_duplex() (in
xircom_up), recompile and see if it makes a difference.

The CVS version is almost irrelevant, I guess Arjan simply rebuild his
repository.
