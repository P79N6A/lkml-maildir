I've had the same problem since 2.3.13pre-something.  I have an all-scsi
system running a P100 on a Triton board. In my case I get "PCTECH RZ1000
(buggy)" overlapping the 03f7 part of the ioport for the floppy.  I know
at least one other report had something else causing the same problem.  I
can post more details if required.
