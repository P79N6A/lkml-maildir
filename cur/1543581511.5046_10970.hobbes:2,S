Considering this is an enterprise-server, you should have a serial-console
to it; this will allow you to log all error-messages. Alternatively
(not as nice, though), is to connect a printer to the parallel-port and
use the parallelconsole option.
Then there's always the LKCD-patches, by SGI, if I'm not all wrong.
