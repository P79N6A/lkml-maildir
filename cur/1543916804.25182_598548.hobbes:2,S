This builds although I lack the hardware to really test it. However, in
2.6.23-rc8-mm1 it collides with git-block-ps3disk-fix.patch. This is a
version on top of that stack but I guess the best thing to do is replace
git-block-ps3disk-fix.patch with Jens patch once it is signed off.
Not signing off because this is just a rebase. Assuming the other one
gets signed off, consider it;
