I am sure it causes a rescan, because activating 
CONFIG_NETFILTER for example makes some options available that are 
defined before NETFILTER, such as IP_ROUTE_FWMARK, IP_VS, 
NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CONNMARK and NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_NOTRACK, and 
activating NETFILTER _will_ cause a rescan with `make oldconfig` - I 
just tried. (Things are a little different with menuconfig/xconfig and 
such of course)
