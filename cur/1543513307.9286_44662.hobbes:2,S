It is not quite clear to me if this is related, however I have an HP
NetServer box as well (not sure which model number) which also has two
NCR controllers on the motherboard. What I found is that all PCI
devices on the motherboard are detected twice and the SCSI driver for
the NCR then tries to probe each twice (in parallel) and boom. I
hacked the sym53c8xx.c driver to get around this quickly and get the
system booted.
I know Martin Mares has some patches for this, but they are not yet
in the standard tree.
