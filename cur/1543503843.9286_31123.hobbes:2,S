I'm guessing that it's a buggy BIOS APM implementation, as the EIP value
isn't in the kernel (I'm guessing it's in the BIOS, I don't know much about
these things); either that or we have buggy power down code -- I suspect the
former as I recall seeing stuff on l-k about this before -- try a search of
the archives.
