The realtek drivers have worked for me, but only (as you said) for 2.4.  They 
also don't support monitor mode, which I would like to use.
I had similar experiences with the sourceforge projects mentioned.  The 
rtl8180+sa2400 bailed with numerous warnings.  The project you mention might 
be the other one on sourceforge, rtl-ddp.  Things seemed to be moving, but 
then stalled.  It compiles and insmods but doesn't have the wireless 
extensions supported yet.  I'm sure everyone involved in the projects is 
busy, but I'm just trying to see if going out and buying a 20 or 30 dollar 
card that is supported would be my best bet.
