printk works erratically on my machine:
the same module with the same kernel priority flag for
printk (eg. KERN_INFO, KERN_EMERG etc) when insmoded
one time will have printk working just fine. but say
the next time  the comp boots, or even i rmmod it and
reinsert, printk won't print anything. 
however in one lifetime of the module, the behaviour
is consistent- either all the printk's work all don't
work.
