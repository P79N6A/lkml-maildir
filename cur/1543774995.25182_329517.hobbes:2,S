Yes indeed, i was certain that i missed something ;)

I agree, that usage looks safe.

Andrew (rightly) tends to howls whenever someone adds a memory barrier 
without a comment ;) So if we were to make that change, how about the 
following accompanying comment;
"smp_wmb ensures that all data dependencies for the callback are posted 
and callback is ready for execution"
Thanks for elaborating, the examples certainly do help clarify usage.
