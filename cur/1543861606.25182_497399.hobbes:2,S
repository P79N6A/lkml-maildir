Subject: [PATCH 4/4] x86_64 ioapic: Improve the heuristics for when check_timer fails.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

To a large extent this reverts b026872601976f666bae77b609dc490d1834bf77
while still keeping to the spirits of it's goal, the ability to
make smart guesses about how the timer irq is routed when the BIOS
gets it wrong.
The code for testing timer routing of a normal apic pin and
and an ExtINT pin has been moved into functions to make the
code easier to read.
I have assumed that we don't want to enable anything with the i8259
unless we are in ExtINT mode.  Reading the patch log indicates
that this seems to be most if not all of the time.
Compared to the pre b026872601976f666bae77b609dc490d1834bf77 state
two heuristic guess have been added:
-  If we cannot make the BIOS supplied timer on an apic pin work we
   guess apic 0 pin 2. As that is the architectural default.
-  When that fails and the BIOS does not provided us with an ExtINT
   mapping we try apic 0 pin 0 as an ExtINT.
Compared to Andi's previous version:
- I do not turn on irq0 in the i8259 and see if the io_apic
  works.  It is not clear that is ever needed.
- I do not guess that irq0 is connected as an ordinary interrupt
  to ioapic 0 pin 0.  I can't see how misprogramming that pin will buy
  us anything especially as it worked as an ExtINT in my testing, on
  one of the Nvidia boards.
- I guess that ExtINT mode and thus irq0 trough the i8259 works
  through apic 0 pin 0.  As this is the architectural default.
By using the architectural defaults our guesses are as
safe as they can be and are likely to work in most of the
cases.  If this still leaves some people out in the cold
we can look at adding some more smart guesses, but my hunch
is that anything more needs to be chipset specific.
Yinghai Lu thanks for your contributions on the infrastructure
support.  While I did not use it directly I did look at your code
when double checking mine to see if looked correct.
Tobias.  I don't have a box with the problem yours does, and this
doesn't quite try any of the cases you have been asked to test
so could you please test this one?
I have tested this on an Nvidia board that reports that apic 0 pin 2
works when it does not and this code successfully programs apic 0 pin 0
into ExtINT mode.
I have not addressed the fact the code for local apic ExtINT guesses 
are a mess and appear to be broken.  That code appears to have been
that way for a long time and no one has seemed to care.
