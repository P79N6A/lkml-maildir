My i845 box seems to only have a tertiary codec (waiting for
verification from Intel) which is only accesible via DMA. I already
started to make this work... hope, I can show some code end of the week.
But there's sth. about i810_ac97_get. The ICH4 manual says, reads _must
not_ cross DWord boundaries. Could there be a problem?
