What I was refering with "native hardware virtualization" is just the
VT or Pacitifica -provided trapping into the hypervisor upon executing
"dangerous" instructions such as tlb-flushes, reading/setting the
current ring-level, cli/sti...

Yes, maybe just providing a switch to force paravirtops to use the
native hardware implementation would be enough, or just in case,
making the default the native hardware and allowing the kernel
commandline to select another one (just like on io-schedulers)

Yes. What I propose is allowing the systems to continue running (only
with degraded performance) when the hv-interface between the running
kernel and the running hypervisor doesn't match.

Thanks, will be setting it up :)
