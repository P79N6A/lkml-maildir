Dearest Kernel Hackers,
We discovered the following bug when bringing up a new Linux router
today.
We're running a stock Debian potato dist with Traffic Shaper installed
to choke off outbound traffic, using shaper-0.15 (latest). A minor
config-file error in our /etc/init.d/network script produced a nasty
kernel panic (kernel: 2.2.9 -- latest stable).
Here's how we produed the kernel panic: (stuff from our network script)
	1. ifconfig eth0 [ipaddr0] netmak [mask0] broadcast [bcast0]
	2. route add default gw [gw] metric 1
	3. shapecfg attach shaper0 eth1
	4. shapecfg speed shaper0 [speed]
	5. ifconfig shaper0 [ipaddr1] netmak [mask1] broadcast [bcast1]
	6. route add -net [network0] netmask [mask0] dev shaper0
Everything works fine so far, but as soon as we typed "route" or tried
to send packets over the interface, it panicked, coughed, bled and
died.
Replacing step #6 with:
	if [ -e /proc/net/ip_input ]; then
		route add -net [network1] netmask [mask1] dev shaper0
	fi
avoided the problem.  While it was a stupid config error on our part,
it should not be bringing down the stable kernel (which is supposed to
be bulletproof... :)
