Spent some more time reading the code. Can't quite claim to understand
all of it, yet, but I notice that most everywhere else drhd->devices[i]
is checked to be != NULL before it is accessed. Why is it safe not to
do that in device_to_iommu()?
Would the patch below be a valid fix? It stops my system from hanging at
boot. But I wonder if there is an assertion that if drhd->ignored is 0
then drhd->devices[0..drhd->device_cnt] is known to be != NULL and
therefore this test is just hiding a bug somewhere else...
