Various processes will lockup on the P4/HT system, usually while under
some load.  The processes cannot be killed.  X will lockup once or twice a
day (which means my console, and thus sysrq, are toast), but I can still
ssh in.  Nothing is logged by the kernel.  Are there any post-lockup 
forensics that can be performed before I reboot?
