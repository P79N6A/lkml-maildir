Don't be ridiculous.  It's trivial to exploit a local buffer overrun in
one of your signed binaries and have the shellcode mmap the rest.  All
pre-built, of course.

Rubbish.  You don't need to compile anything locally and the rest will be
done once by some wanker with half a clue and then repeated by wankers
without a clue (aka script kiddies).
