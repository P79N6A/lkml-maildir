Hi,
I had fun with a remote system (custom vanilla kernel 2.6.24.4), a
NIC sort-of died all of a sudden.
(note: eth4 is udev's idea, not mine - the box has just 2 NICs).
/var/log/messages:
Jan 19 09:25:59 A kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth4: transmit timed out

(FWIW, there also was a BUG with trace info via dmesg but I did not
save that info, nor did it show up in any logfile, doh)
System was rebooted but instead of getting rid of the problem, it
showed eth4 was not usable anymore. It did not show up in dmesg/via
ifconfig and the corresponding lspci -vvv entry states:

I replaced the NIC and everything works as expected:

Just for the fun of it, I plugged the faulty NIC into a sole win
machine, it worked. Doesn't work in the linux machine afterwards,
though. First time that I observe such strange behaviour, any ideas
what could be the cause?
