Thanks for doing this, i have a few comments;

This one is slightly confusing readability wise since ia64 already does
the vector based interrupt numbering. Perhaps CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR should
really be CONFIG_MSI but that's up to you. I wonder if we could
consolidate these vector allocators as assign_irq_vector(AUTO_ASSIGN) has
the same semantics as ia64_alloc_vector() and the one for i386 is also
almost the same as its MSI ilk.

Is this supposed to return number of vectors available for external
devices? Also regarding vector allocation, assign_irq_vector() in
drivers/pci/msi.c only can allocate 166 vectors before going -ENOSPC is
this intentional?
