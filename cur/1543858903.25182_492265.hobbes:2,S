correct, i needed it for gcc 4.0.2. If you want this feature upstream, 
this has to be solved - no way are we going to phase out portions of 
gcc4. It's not hard as you can see it from my patch, non-static 
container_of is very rare. We do alot of other hackery to keep older 
compilers alive, and we only drop compiler support if some important 
feature really, really needs new gcc and a sane workaround is not 
possible.

the problem on -rt is the per-CPU slab buffer handling. In vanilla they 
are handled with irqs off/on - but inside is an unbound algorithm so for 
-rt i converted the local_irq_disable() logic to per-CPU locks. So this 
is an -rt only problem.
hm, even on vanilla you might run into problems in slab_destroy(), there 
we hold the l3 lock.

lockdep just uses a large compile-time array to allocate from and never 
grows that array.

yeah, delayed RCU freeing might work better.

i'm just saying that for upstream you have to make up your mind about 
them and have to provide a simplified configuration API. Sometimes it's 
hard, but it has to be done. Experience is that both users and 
distributors /will/ misconfigure it.

we try to never expose something like this via the config 
infrastructure. One solution here would be to use CONFIG_BASE_SMALL, 
that's the standard way of expressing that the kernel is for a small 
machine.

lockdep saves all of them because stack traces are very useful in their 
entirety. But lockdep really allocates everything internally and puts 
out a warning and turns itself off if that pool is depleted. Also, the 
amount of memory needed for lockdep is bound by the number of unique 
lock acquire sites in the kernel, while kmemleak might need /alot/ of 
memory if there's lots of small allocations around - so the comparison 
to lockdep in this area is not valid.
