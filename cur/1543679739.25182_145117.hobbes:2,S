I was wondering whether you are working on the radeonfb issue in 2.5
since forever that there is a lot of multicolored garbage on the screen
initially when the kernel starts, and the first clear text seen are ACPI
notices. Is it an issue of transferring what was written to the display
in raw mode to the FB? The 2.4 radeonfb driver does not have this
issue.
This is one of the last things on my 2.5 wishlist for me, I'll die a
happy man if you can fix it :)
