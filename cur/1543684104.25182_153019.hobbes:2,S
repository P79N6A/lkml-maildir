Be cautious about how much work you do here ... while you can burn
as much cpu time as you like on an idle cpu without affecting anything,
you need to be sure that your activities don't burn too much bus
bandwidth, or cause cache lines to ping-pong around the machine. The
classic case of this has been seen while one cpu is trying to boot,
and the other 31 idle cpus beat the bus to death looking to see
whether they can "help".
