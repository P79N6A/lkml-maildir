Hi Fengguang, Mike,
 I can add myself to Mikes question. It would be good to know a "roadmap" for the writeback changes. Testing 2.6.24-rcX so far has been showing quite nice improvement of the overall writeback situation and it would be sad to see this [partially] gone in 2.6.24-final. Linus apparently already has reverted  "...2250b". I will definitely repeat my tests with -rc8. and report.
 Cheers
Martin
