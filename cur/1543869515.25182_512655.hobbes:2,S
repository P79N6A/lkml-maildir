I'm seeing something like that since installing 2.6.20.1 yesterday:
matroxfb: Matrox Mystique (PCI) detected
PInS memtype = 0
matroxfb: MTRR's turned on
matroxfb: 1024x768x8bpp (virtual: 1024x4096)
matroxfb: framebuffer at 0xE1000000, mapped to 0xcc880000, size 4194304
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
fb0: MATROX frame buffer device
**WARNING** I2C adapter driver [DDC:fb0 #0] forgot to specify physical device;
