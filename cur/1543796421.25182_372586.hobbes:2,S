Which card do you have?  What card # does it report in dmesg?  What 
tuner # is it using?  What is the PCI Subsystem id?
The following MIGHT fix it.... If so, I'll need the answers to the four 
questions above, in order to make this behavior occur by default:
modprobe  tda9887
This fixes the problem for analog video with pcHDTV 3000 and DViCO 
FusionHDTV3 Gold-T.  We've already fixed it in cvs so that this will be 
detected by default, if you have a different card, we might have to 
apply a similar fix.  If that doesn't help, then it's a different bug.
