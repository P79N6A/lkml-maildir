Have you had any memory trouble or similar with this machine?
It looks very much like a single-bit error:

Here "edx" appears to be bh->b_pprev pointer, which can quite validly be
NULL for a non-hashed page.
So a value of all zeroes, or a kernel pointer value (ie 0xC.....) would
be valid, but 0x00100000 is not.
It doesn't have to be bad memory, of course - it could easily be a wild
pointer and a bit set operation.. But.
