Hi,
I added a file (robin.c) with a varible (robactive) to the kernel
network
code and want to change its value and output other kernel data
(rob_head).
So I wrote a char device-driver module (robindevice.c), but when I try
to
insmod robindevice.o  it, I get the message:
         robindevice: "unresolved symbol robactive".
Sources:
kernel:
/usr/src/linux-2.2.10-robin/include/net/robin.h
... struct ratenglied{...}; ...
net/ipv4/robin.c
... #include <net/robin.h>
    int robactive = 1;
    struct ratenglied *rob_head=NULL; ...
module:
/Robin/DeviceDriver/robindevice.c
... #include "/usr/src/linux-2.2.10-robin/include/net/robin.h"
    extern int robinactive;
    extern struct ratenglied *rob_head;  ...
/Robin/DeviceDriver/Makefile
... CC = gcc
    MODCFLAGS := -O -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__
    TARGET = robindevice
    SOURCES = robindevice.c
    OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:%.c=%.o)
    all: $(TARGET).o
    $(TARGET).o: $(SOURCES) /usr/include/linux/version.h
	     $(CC) $(MODCFLAGS) -c $(SOURCES)
I found an entry robinactive in /usr/src/linux-2.2.10/System.map.
(I added 'int robinactive=1;' to robin.h and made it extern in robin.c,
no problem to insmod the driver, but then it only used a copy; printk
showed two different values in kernel and module.)
Why is robinactive a unresolved symbol, what have I to do, so that I
can use the char driver module to read and write data to kernel
variable and structures?
Thanks,
	Guido
