Hi,
  A new version of the mount patch (version 0.2) for NFSv3 has been
written, in order to address a few bugs.
RPMS and the patch against mount-2.9 can be found under
   
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount
Cheers,
  Trond
NB: This special version of mount assumes that all linux-2.2.6 and
greater versions are capable of NFSv3.
Do NOT install it on machines that are to run linux-2.2.6 or greater
without the NFSv3 patches, or you will see the message:
   nfs warning: mount version newer than kernel
The automatic detection of NFSv3 capabilities on the server will cause
your mount to fail in this case...

I've moved the polling to the 'bg' loop, so this should now hopefully
work as expected.

The polling now checks only the mount version number, and assumes that
any server advertising version 3 of the mountd RPC protocol supports
NFS v3.
In addition, we now try to match the mountd port to the TCP/IP
protocol.
