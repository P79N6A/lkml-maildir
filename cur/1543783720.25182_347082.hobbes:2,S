It isn't extensible though.  One couldn't retain this approach while adding
(random cfs ignorance exposure) upgrade-read, downgrade-write,
query-for-various-runtime-stats, priority modification, whatever.

Well, as I say.  Making it a filesystem is superficially attractive, but
once you've build a super-dooper enterprise-grade infrastructure on top of
it all, nobody's going to touch the fs interface by hand and you end up
wondering why it's there, adding baggage.
Not that I'm questioning the fs interface!  It has useful permission
management, monitoring and resource releasing characteristics.  I'm
questioning the open() tricks.  I guess from Joel's tiny description, the
filesystem's interpretation of mknod and mkdir look sensible enough.
