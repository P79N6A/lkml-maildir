The insistence mentioned was implicit, of course.

tasklist_lock, infamous for setting off the NMI oopser (i.e. watchdogs
that panic machines when interrupts are ignored for long periods of
time) when users run many instances of top(1) or other nonsense. Not
a performance concern per se, but it may very well be hopeless anyway.
There are several threads about the rwlock algorithms being unfair and
taking out machines and/or persistently starving writers. Probably the
most recent one was started by Kevin van Maren. There Linus suggested
eventually adding a fair rwlock primitive to address this.
