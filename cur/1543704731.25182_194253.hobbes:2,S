Well, it's the o.p. system, not mine, but I don't see how noatime will
help him, the atime shouldn't change unless he's doing disk access, and
if he's doing disk access the disk will spin up anyway.
The place noatime helps is when actually doing reads to open files, and
getting an inode update free with every read. His problem is that
something really is accessing the drive, and he won't get the desired
spindown until that's addressed.

I hope the original poster is following this ;-)
