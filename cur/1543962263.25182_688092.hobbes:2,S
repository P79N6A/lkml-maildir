Just to add some emphasis here - this is something that took me a long time to figure out, and since it is the pattern for dealing with the x86 trees and with the mm git tree and with linux-next, it would help if it were documented somewhere (not that I can imagine where).  Once you know it, it becomes obvious, but try staring at a merge conflict for a while trying to figure out what to do, and it gets frustrating.  I wonder if we can guess how many testers abandon the mm git tree or the linux-next tree because of this.
It might be nice if git supported a command like git-remote-help or something that would fetch a predefined help file from a remote tree that describes the workflow for that tree.
But at least with an extra reply to this mail, it might creep higher in the google search results when looking for merge conflicts with linux-next.
