I agree with Patrick.
Changing config options of any kind can result in the main kernel
image needing to be rebuilt.  One thing we can do to prevent human
mistakes, is to make the "make modules" pass do a quick "is vmlinux
uptodate?" check, and if not print out an error message explaining the
situation and aborting the "make modules" attempt.
