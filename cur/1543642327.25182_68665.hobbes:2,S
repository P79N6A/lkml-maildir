I'm assuming for the moment that the discussion here is
about what to report to stat(2) and not how to deal with
internal overflow (which should produce an error).
So what you are suggesting is that 
<pseudocode>
	if (i.i_nlink > ST_NLINK_MAX)
		st.st_nlink = S_ISDIR(i.i_mode) ? 1 : ST_NLINK_MAX;
</pseudocode>
I don't know the rationale for st_nlink == 1 on directories
but it seems to me the thing to do is st_nlink == 0 on
overflow regardless of type.  This simplifies the logic and
eliminates the use a funky special value that gets in the
way of supporting growth.
An st_nlink value of 0 could only occur if you were doing an
fstat() on a deleted file so i doubt much would break on
this odd case.  Having said that no doubt someone will come
up with an example to prove me wrong :)
