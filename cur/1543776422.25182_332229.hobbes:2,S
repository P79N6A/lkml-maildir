So are defines.

Are the advantages big enough to actively discourage defines? It's nice 
that you do reviews, but please leave some room for personal preferences. 
If the code is correct and perfectly readable, it doesn't matter whether 
to use defines or enums. Unless you also intent to also debug and work 
with that code, why don't leave the decision to the author?
