Well, not always (considering the number of non-X embedded systems out there),
but I take your point.  So it really boils down to not having a tickless kernel,
or an X server that calls gettimeofday 1 million times per second (I think thats
the number that Dave threw out there).  Unless of course, you have a third
alternative, which, as I mentioned before I would be happy to take a crack at,
if you would elaborate on your idea a little more.
Thanks & Regards
