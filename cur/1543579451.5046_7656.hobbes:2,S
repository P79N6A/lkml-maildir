Let me just point out that Nigel (I think) has previously stated that
the purpose of this approach is to bring the stunning success of 
IRIX style "RT" to Linux. Since some of us believe that IRIX is a virtual
handbook of OS errors, it really comes down to a design style. I think
that simplicity and "does the main job well" wins every time over 
"really cool algorithms" and "does everything badly". Others 
disagree.
