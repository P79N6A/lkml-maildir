Oh, absolutely. The problem, however, is that very very few people actually 
use these function attributes in their code. Heck, we don't even use the 
standard restrict keyword, much less gcc-specific function annotations.
I think that one part of the problem is because gcc seems to have had 
attribute diarrhea -- I know of noone who can recite more than 10% of the 
available attributes without glancing at the documentation. The other part of 
the problem is that gcc does no sanity checks on the provided attributes. For 
example, the code below compiles perfectly fine without a peep, even 
with -Wall and -Wextra.
int global;
void foobar(const int *x) __attribute__((const));
void foobar(const int *x)
{
        if (*x)
                *(int *)x = 7;
        global = 11;
}
*grumble, grumble* :-)
