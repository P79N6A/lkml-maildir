Try 30.000 clients or more on a x86 32bit box. 
That will show you the difference quite nicely :-)
More seriously: Thread per client scales only to a certain amount of clients
	per RAM. If you like to scale beyond that to like to minimize your state 
	per client. If you have a thread then you have a task structure as 
	unswappable memory in kernel, a per-thread stack, which is reducing 
	your virtual memory per process (you have only around 3GB of virtual 
	memory per process in Linux x86 32bit).
	So one uses a process or thread pool to scale beyond that. 
	Pool size is typically related to the amount of CPU cores in the system.
