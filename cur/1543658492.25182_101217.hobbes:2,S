Running 2.5.52 (unpatched) I see these mesages on the console. I didn't 
see them right a boot time, but they are there in the morning (about 8 
hours later).
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 1 to 56
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 3 to 57
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 5 to 58
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 6 to 59
The system is running ntpd against a stratum three server, APM has system 
time in GMT, let me know if any other info is useful, I may not run this 
kernel again unless someone cares about this message.
