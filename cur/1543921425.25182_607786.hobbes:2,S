Umm... I think that will work backwards, and give you CONFIG_FOO=y
if.f the kernel *supports* modules. What he needs is to be able to say
CONFIG_FOO=n or CONFIG_FOO=m, but *ban* CONFIG_FOO=y.
(At least, in my kernel, I have MODULES=y, and several other things
from init/Kconfig have 'depends on MODULES' and also end up 'y':
% zgrep MODULE /proc/config.gz 
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=y
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD=y
CONFIG_MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL=y
CONFIG_MODULE_VERIFY_ELF=y
