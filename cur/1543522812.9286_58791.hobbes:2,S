That sounds quite normal for a machine that has passed the point where the
working set for the active processes no longer fits in ram.

Lots of paging by the sound of it. It is probably not "stuck in D state"
but "going in and out of D state a lot". The only case I'd expect it to stay
in D a lot would be if it is paging stuff in/out and hits a scsi problem
at which point it would stay stuck while the scsi error handling kicked in
but you'd have a log entry if so
