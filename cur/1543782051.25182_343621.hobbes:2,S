I assume it worked OK in 2.6.12.
There are no changes in the driver which would explain this.

gargh, I have acpi feelings.  Could you please
a) Compare /proc/interrupts for 2.6.12 and 2.6.13-rc6
b) Generate the boot-time dmesg output for 2.6.12 and 2.6.13-rc6
   (dmesg -s 1000000 > foo), then do
	diff -u dmesg-2.6.12 dmesg-2.6.13-rc6 > foo
   and send foo?
