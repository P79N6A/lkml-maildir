Hi Patrick,
You have hit on one of the key word of my downfall.
Specifications!!!
I believe in them and they are the inflexable state machine which all OSes
are required to address.  Linux has a very bad history of avoiding the
boundary conditions related to storage.
I am for following the rules of the spec, and will bet Linus would now
agree more so than before.  The problem is SCSI is a strange beast without
a formal FSM.  It is more of a BusPhase psuedo stated transport.  It is
smart enough to laugh at bad software designs and keep going.  Sheesh,
look at M$'s miniport.
This leads me to a point where a similar (but smarter) miniport could look
interesting.  However, this is also where the transport classes have their
bases, afaics.  Anyone please correct me where I have mistated (other than
Linus, :-p).
Luben, I have a vested interest in seeing SAS run via SCSI.  So this means
you have one ex-demi-god from the world of maintainers looking to pull you
have towards the current path and open to ideas and willing to back a
better design and push it.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
