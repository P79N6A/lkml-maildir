Hi guys,
i am trying to use the linux signaling to signal a user process from 
the kernel..
i require a reliable(without any signal loss) and fast signaling 
mechanism.
i tried to use the send_sigqueue to send the signals...here what i did
1) creted the sigqueue structure using the sigqueue_alloc()..
2) called the send_sigqueue() function...
it worked fine for some time(around 1000 sig) but after that 
sigqueue_alloc failing..may be becuse of not enough memory  available 
to allocate sigqueue..
i got few question about this..
1) does sigqueue structure need to be removed explisitly or it will be 
autometically cleared after the signal delivery (i did't used the 
sigqueue_free() becuse i dont know when the signal is deliverd).
2)there is any another way i can implement such a signaling mechanism.
i will be thankful for your help...
