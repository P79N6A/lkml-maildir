how is that related to my suggestion to revisit the vmlist_lock spinlock
patch? I agree that vmalloc in every poll is totally out of the question
(and never suggested that). But making vmalloc()/vfree()/ioremap()
SMP-safe is, imho, of benefit regardless. The more users of of those
functions are there, the more sense it makes to have vmlist spinlock. It
is because there is no such spinlock /proc/kcore cannot 100% guarantee
reliable results when walking vmlist (see XXX in fs/proc/kcore.c). We
could take big kernel lock, I suppose but, imo, it is best avoided.
Regards,
Tigran.
