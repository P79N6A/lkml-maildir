That's basically my idea. By default CAP_SYS_RAWIO is needed to issue any
comand. This will work fine if the software has been adjusted accordingly
*and* there is a software for the desired purpose.
However, there are cases where users have to be granted read or write
access to devices (databases, strange hardware, co-admins). In this cases,
the admin should be able to allow certain SCSI commands even for non-root
users.
