Yup, though Paul's patch is a first step in the right way as I don't
think anybody sane plan to fix the IDE release code to make it interrupt
safe ;) At least I don't...

The code is indeed strangely backward, I had to deal with that in 2.4
for the PowerBook hotswap CD bay and will soon have to review that for
2.4.21-pre & 2.5.

Yup, this have been a problem for me too, as ide_unregister for example
fails with a mounted fs. So the user had effectively removed the drive
from the bay, but I couldn't free the interface... nasty. Especially if
the user then plugs some different IDE device in the bay, the kernel
will get completely confused.
