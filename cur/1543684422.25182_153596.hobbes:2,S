I have the same opinion with respect to 2.6.0-test2-mm2 here, but with a
box much more powrful than yours (fact that did not prevent jerky
behaviour in past kernel releases though).
Under my "common" workload (X, Mozilla in pages full of crap^Wflash,
xmms, several monitors, spamassassin analyzing no less than 10
simultaneous mails, and "make -j25 bzImage" to add some more work to the
mix) mouse movement was smooth, and MP3 didn't skip. So i nthis aspect,
2.6.0-test2-mm2 is better than 2.6.0-test2-G7 (2.6.0-test2 with Ingo's
sched-2.6.0-test1-G7).
But there is one thing 2.6.0-test2-mm2 "does" worse than 2.6.0-test2-G7,
and that is prevent windows in X to freeze under heavy window movement
(with "show contents of windows while moving" ON, of course). Under
2.6.0-test2-G7 I was unable to make windows freeze, but with
2.6.0-test2-mm2 I can after several seconds, and the moving window (and
the rest of them) get frozen for a while (couple of seconds).
Hope this helps.
