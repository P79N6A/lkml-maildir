Well... MSIs are just normal stores as far as PCI is concerned. Thus, if
you have P2P bridges in your system and they can't get store ordering
right, I think you have a much bigger problem than getting MSIs wrong.
I think the problem is mostly with host bridges doing crappy stuffs like
decoding MSIs up front and sending them to the CPU out of order or
HT<->PCI (or some home made backbone <-> PCI) bridges where MSIs gets
turned into something else with potentially ordering breakage at the
transformation point or the upstream bus.

Host bridges or something <-> PCI (something = HT, or some of the fancy
NB<->SB links other vendors use).

Yeah, well, the later can be solved in software by masking the LSI when
MSI is enabled for a device.
