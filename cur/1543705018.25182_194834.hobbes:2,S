[Head spins] Forgive me, but my glibc/linker knowledge is minimal, so
I'm mostly guessing at the meaning of your comments above. 
The picture in my mind is:
Ulrich is suggesting the vsyscall-sysenter code be extended to such that
it switches on the syscall number and jumps to the vsyscall-gettimeofday
code when appropriate. This avoids having to change glibc. 
Jamie is suggesting that the extra indirection
glibc->sysenter->vgettimeofday could be simply cut down to
glibc->vgettimeofday. This requires changing glibc, but would be faster.
Personally I like Ulrich's suggestion, as it requires no change to
userspace. I had even considered it in developing the patch, but with
the current vsyscall-sysenter being all asm, I figured I could implement
the LD_PRELOAD code much faster. 
Another issue with having a separate entry point for vgettimeofday is
that I don't quite understand how glibc detects if vsyscall is
available, and how deals with the vsyscall page moving around. It seems
the i386 4/4g split patch moved the vsyscall-sysenter page to 0xffffd000
(instead of 0xffffe000). I've conditionally padded the fixmap table so
vgettimeofday() is at 0xffffc000 regardless, but clearly this isn't the
best thing to do. 
Thoughts?
