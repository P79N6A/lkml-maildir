ioctl(TIOCSETD/TIOCGETD) sets/returns an integer identifier
that can be compared agains the N_XXX macros. If you are
not explicitly setting this then is is probably the default N_TTY.
Also at the application level, look at tcsetattr() for setting
the termios features. Look specifically at the c_cc[VTIME] and c_cc[VMIN]
members of the termios structure. These settings control how
much data must be available before returning data to a read().
Try VTIME=0 and VMIN=1.
Since your 'missing' data is always on the tail end, maybe
VMIN is set to 64 or something.
