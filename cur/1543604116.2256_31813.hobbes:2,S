Subject: is reparent_to_init a good thing to do?

I was looking at the driver under drivers/net/8139too.c, a kernel
thread rtl8139_thread is created, it calls daemonize() and soon
afterwards calls reparent_to_init(). Looking at reparent_to_init(),
it looks like all kernel threads should do this. But, I feel I am missing
something, since not everybody does this.
Is this a good thing to do? or are there special cases when we need this.
