Hmmm, puzzling.

It should be as safe as anything else (it's the fallback for filesystems
that don't implement fsync).  file_fsync does a sync on the device the
filesystem is mounted on, which covers everything except dirty shared
mmap()ings of the file (which ext2_file_sync doesn't deal with anyways);
it just generates more disk writes than nescessary, but no reads.
