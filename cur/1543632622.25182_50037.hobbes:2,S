Hmmm, a quick glance makes the test in ext2_put_inode look unsafe.
iput calls put_inode before decrementing i_count.  So, nothing stops 5
iput callers from all deciding i_count > 2 and leaving the preallocation
blocks hanging.
Also, a knfsd triggered iget/iput pair should hit the same race with an
put_inode call.
Or am I missing something?
