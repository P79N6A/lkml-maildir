If you *know* it is compiled into your kernel, and you *know* it
is enabled via the above, and it still does not work, do the
following:
Run:
showkey -s
Then press LALT quickly followed by SYSRQ, and keep holding both
down, and you should see:
0x38
0x54
You might see a bunch of extra 0x38's which is ok.
If however when you press ALT-SYSRQ you see:
0x38 0x54 0xd4
and are still holding both keys down, then your keyboard is
broken and incompatible with the kernel SYSRQ feature.
A proper keyboard will only show "0x38 0x54".  I have written a
patch for SYSRQ to allow it to be used with broken keyboards that
send the make+break code for the SYSRQ sequence simultaneously.
If you need it, let me know and I'll send it to you.
