Anyone know what I should believe?  Sar's pgpgin/s and pgpgout/s tell me 
  that it is paging in/out from/to disk.  Yet pswpin/s and pswpout/s are 
both 0.  Swapping and paging are the same thing I believe. pgpgin/out 
refer to paging, pswpin/out refer to swapping.  So I for one am confused.
I guess I could dig through the source but I figured someone might have 
encountered this disrepency in the past.
