Neat.
I would appreciate somewhat more readability, though. It's not very
simple to figure out in which state an option is (Y/N/M) if it's not focused.
Maybe put the selected variant before the option name:
+ Networking options
  + Packet socket
  | <M> Netlink device emulation
  | <N> Network packet filtering ...
Besides, i think your selection of qt as gui platform is not making you
many friends, though greatly speeded up the development.
