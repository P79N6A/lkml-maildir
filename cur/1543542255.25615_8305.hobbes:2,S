I'm not sure what happens at the native API level, but at least some
of the other stuff has the notion of one current directory per drive.

OK. So the EA is not in the general namespace.
All EAs are set at once? Does the kernel care if you pass
it a mess of broken EA data structures?

I don't think this is right because...

NT supports a POSIX subsystem that is able to create this.
You can put everything but '/' and '\0' in filenames by using
the POSIX subsystem. At the native API level, I think even
those are legal filename characters.
The sysinternals people had fun putting '\0' in the registry.
NT's native API tends to use counted 16-bit strings instead
of the more typical nul-terminated 8-bit strings, so you can
make quite a bit of trouble for Win32-based admin tools.
