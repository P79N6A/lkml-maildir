Hi,
  I am porting Linux to an embedded system. Currently my rootfilesystem is
around 2.5 MB (after keeping it to minimal and adding tools like busybox). I
want to furthur reduce it to say maximum of 1.5 MB. 
Please suggest some link/references where I can find the details to optimise
my root filesystem
thanks
Amol
