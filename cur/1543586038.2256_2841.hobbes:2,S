And every time the SIGDANGER comes up, the issue that AIX provides
*both* early and late allocation mechanism even on per-process basis
that can be controlled by *both* the programmer and the admin is
completely ignored. Linux supports none of these and with the current
model it's quite possible the handler code is still sitting on the disk
and no memory will be available to page it in. Or do you want to see
more apps running as setuid-root and mlocking the handler wasting useful
memory and opening even more window for security exploits in the future?
And even using capabilities instead of setuid-root, only developers
could influence the behavior, not admins who must operate the box. No,
at present the SIGDANGER bloat would be just a fake excuse but wouldn't
address the root of problems at all.
