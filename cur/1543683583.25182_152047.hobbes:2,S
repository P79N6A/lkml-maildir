I'm no native speaker, but Webster says:
obsolete:
 a) no longer in use or no longer useful 
 b) of a kind or style no longer current
broken:
 2) damaged or altered by breaking
 5) not complete or full
so I would prefer BROKEN over OBSOLETE, at least
for drivers which are known _not_ to work as expected,
but OBSOLETE over BROKEN for oldfashioned, but working
drivers superceeded by newer ones ...
JMHO,
Herbert
