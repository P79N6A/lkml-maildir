Actually, no, unfortunately that doesn't work (and I did actually try
it).  The problem is that the target_reap actually removes the target
from the sysfs namespace.  So, if the reap is still pending but you
cannot find the target, you'll allocate one, but then you may be racing
to add it to the namespace (i.e. a quick succession of scsi
remove-single-device followed by scsi add-single-device of the same
H/C/T/L shows this).  If you lose the race, the add fails because the
namespace is already occupied.  And, unfortunately, the device_del that
does the namespace removal requires user context ...
