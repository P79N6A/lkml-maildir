This patch is a result of trying to extend the kernel command-line
size on x86 to more than 256 bytes. People requested to not allocate a
larger buffers for small systems.
I don't know who should decide the tradeoff...
So what you basically say is that many modules need to be fixed...
./arch/avr32/boards/atstk1000/setup.c
./arch/frv/kernel/setup.c
./arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c
./arch/i386/kernel/mpparse.c
./arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
./arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c
<many more>
