	Good point....um, what's a "viterbi" codec?  Now I wonder if a VMware
type of approach with each VM having it's own 'committed' virtual swap would
approach the type of compartmentalisation needed (?).  Would have to figure
out a way for different VM's at the same security level to communicate w/each
other...
