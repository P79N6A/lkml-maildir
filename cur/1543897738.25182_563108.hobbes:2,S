Ok, this should have been read as kernel/module dev/user right to leverage 
each others code under GPL and out of good-will to yield an increased 
harvest.

It's not my decision, it's the kernel maintainers decision to reject 
inclusion for one reason or another.  One reason could be a simple "we don't 
think this is useful".
Also, I think it's unrealistic to expect thousands of little-used modules to 
be included into mainline.
But, should we hinder that community to grow?
Thanks!
