I suspect that the number of companies that have realized that there is a
market outside Wintel, but who haven't done *anything* to support it,
is vanishingly small.

Probably very few.  Among other things, doing that flags the company as
"yes, we *do* realize you guys are a market, but not one worth writing a
driver for".  That's worse PR for the company than "they haven't Heard
The Word yet...."
