I've never made this experience..I use the driver for more than 2 years.
On my laptop the driver will be unloaded 2-3 times per day...no oops..
Interesting is that some of my friends use the same card and the same driver / kernel and they don't have any problems..
Perhaps my card is defective? How can I test it?
