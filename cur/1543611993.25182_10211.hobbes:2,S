AFAIK, changes to the required versions of userland-tools wouldn't
during a stable release happen ever-so-often. I can agree that it
wouldn't be ideal to introduce a completely new requirement, though.
A C-version of CML2-configurator would be a nice solution here.
But, I'm fairly confident that Marcello will make the right decisions
on his own.
