	Yes, but they will cite the prohibition against *creating* derived works.

	There's a difference between what you can and can't do and what you can and
can't get away with. You can get away with making a Harry Potter sequel in
the privacy of your own home because nobody would find about it, however
legally, you do not have the right to create the derived work. However, if
you did have the right to create the derived work, you'd automatically have
the right to distribute it to anyone who already owned the original work
from which it was derived.

	Right, however, you have the right to create that derivative work.

	These cases are much more interesting, except for the MS VC case. In the MS
VC case, there's a EULA that courts are likely to consider part of the sales
contract. As for the others, I think you'd have a very good chance of
winning them. See, for example, ProCD v. Zeidelberg (sp?). In the absence of
a shrink wrap or clickthrough at least, it would seem you only have those
specific rights copyright grants you, and the right to restrict the
distribution of derived works is not one of those rights.
