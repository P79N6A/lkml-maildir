I didn't think I had to be quite so precise.

Direct communication with Richard Gooch tends to get things solved in very
short order.  He is a busy man, helpful emails get a lot more than crass
emails.

Richard has commented on this and has solicited reports about what isn't
supported.  He isn't being selective, he is human and has a finite amount of
time each day.  Going through 100 megs of source is a tedious job.  Because
much of this work means changes to other people's code, a lot of people feel
their turf is being intruded upon.  And normally the reaction is irritable.

I don't have this answer. Richard is the guy to talk with.

Instead of expecting one man to invent everything that everyone is pleased
with, submit suggestions and help out with the development.

I don't have a USB printer, but I do have USB mice and other USB things. 
/dev/misc/ probably has your usb mouse.  That's where mine are.  my usb hub,
camera, web cam, etc are all in the right places.  The /dev/v4l/ has a lot
of it naturally.

I understand your frustration.  But I do think that working with Richard
instead of against him will get things solved and supported much more
quickly.  If I had just a few more minutes of time, I'd help do some code.

I'm positive you'll see it show up.  People do have lives to live as well as
write kernel code ya know =)

Then you're going great.  Keep sending those patches.

Yes, you do.  If I had your hardware, I'd be fixing up the drivers so they
worked.
I've done it for various things in the past until the patches got merged,
when I get toys that aren't supported, I start building support.  Eventually
my widget does it's widgety things in the mainstream kernel or whatever
software.
