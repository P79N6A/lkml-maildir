Same hardware as I'm using, but I haven't seen any OOPSes
already for a long time.
Currently I'm using the same kernel 2.4.19-pre9-ac3, XFree86-4.2.0
(with one i810 chipset related fix applied), KDE-3.0.1
All these are compiled with gcc-3.1 release. I haven't seen
any kernel OOPS'es already for a rather long time.

PS. i810 fix I mentioned dos not fix kernel OOPS, but only
X11 fatal error when switching from X11 to console (especially nasty
with new KDE versions, haven't seen with GNOME)
