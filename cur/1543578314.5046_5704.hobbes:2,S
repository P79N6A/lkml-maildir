It can do _tons_ of stuff.
Remember, on platforms like this, one of the reasons for being low on
memory is things like running X and netscape: maybe you have 64MB of RAM
and you don't think you need a swap device, and you want to have a web
browser.
The fact that we cannot touch _dirty_ pages doesn't mean that there's
nothing to do: instead of running out of memory we can at least make the
machine usable by dropping the text pages and the page cache..

If we don't have any swapspace, the dirty pages will not be on any lists:
they will never have exited the page tables, and they will just be dirty
anonymous, unlisted pages.
We'll still scan the page tables (and see them there), but we have to do
that to find the clean and unreferenced pages - we don't have separate
"dirty page tables" and "clean page tables" ;)
