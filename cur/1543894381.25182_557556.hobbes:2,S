I can make improvements to GPLv2+ files under GPLv3 (or rather will,
after GPLv3 is published).  And you wrote:

So which is it?  Do you want to be able to use other people's
improvements, respecting the conditions you said they are legitimately
entitled to make, or is this not quite the whole story?

I understand this very well.  You'd have to get the kernel upgraded to
GPLv3 in order to accept the contribution.
Likewise for any other contribution under any other GPLv2-incompatible
license.
So, you see, your statement above, about wanting to be able to use
other people's improvements, cannot be taken without qualification.
