Certainly the simplest solution, and it also solves a related
but rare problem: People booting linux from ROM long before
the disks have time to spin up.
There seems to be a disadvantage in that one must specify
this pause manually, but the admin have to select the root fs
somewhere anyway (lilo.conf) and may specify the delay at
the same time.

Sure, if the USB core can know, then it should use the knowledge.
Or utilize a simple timeout if all it knows is that "common
storage devices appear on the bus up to 10s after powerup/reset".
