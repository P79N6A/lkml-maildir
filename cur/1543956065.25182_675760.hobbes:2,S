I think there was a standalone ratelimit function. I'd use it like this:
static atomic_alloc_ratelimit; /* needs to be initialized ... */
{
	...
	if (success)
		return mem;
	if(!debug && ratelimit(atomic_alloc_ratelimit))
		return err_ptr(-ENOMEM);
	if (printk_ratelimit(first line) > 0) {
		printk(rest);
	}
}

You shouldn't frighten the users either. /proc/sys/vm/debug?
