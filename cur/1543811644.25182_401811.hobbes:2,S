Interleaving is a special feature to be used only if we know that the 
objects are used in a system wide fashion. Interleave should never be the 
default option.
F.e. inode interleaving for a process that is running on one 
node and scanning files will reduce performance. This is the typical
case.
On the other hand if files are used by multiple processes in a cpuset then 
interleaving may be beneficial.

Because these are the types of objects that may benefit from 
interleaving. Other slabs need to always be allocated in a node local 
way.
