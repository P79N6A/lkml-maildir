linux/irq.h must not be included in generic code, it's actually more
and asm-generic/hw_irq.h.  Please restructure the code so that the
cpuset code calls into an arch interface which will then be implemented
by arch code (which in most cases will be genirq, the other can be left
stubbed out for now)
