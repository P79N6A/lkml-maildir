verbose config option - please explain what you have in mind here.

It is sometimes usefull to see what a specific config option is dependent
of. But you are right that it is not visible in menuconfig (today) when
"depends on" is not satisfied.
I'm digging through Petr Baudis patch to link lxdialog with kconfig -
and when finished I may look into extending menuconfig a bit.
