This is Dell computer with video card on motherboard, without PCI slots.
There is one hard disk:
hda: ST3630A, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: ST3630A, 601MB w/120kB Cache, CHS=1223/16/63
and one Ethernet:
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af 1b 91 55, IRQ 10.
There is also ppp connection by serial port (ericsson terminal called HIS).
No soundcard, no floppy, no other network devices.
