FWIW, SBS only mentions mAh and mWh.  AFAIK, all other (meaningful) units
should be able to be converted to either Ah or Wh, assuming enough precision
on the math.  I never heard of any other way to fuel-gauge batteries than
these two main modes (current-based or capacity-based), but I don't work on
the battery field.
That said, you may need to use uWh and uAh instead of mAh and mWh, though.
