   The patch only deals with the ip_defrag_queue path. I have not seen the
   alternate one happen. It's only been up an hour, I'll put some more time on
   it.

This is basically what is in my tree right now.  However, there was
one reporter who claimed that after this kind of change he still was
able to lockup/OOPS his machine by logging into X as a user who had
his home directory over NFS.  This was with netfilter enabled as well
so it has to be the same bug.
