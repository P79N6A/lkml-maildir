Suppose Pi has higher priority than P_{i-1}.
Even if there is a priority queue, once P0 has the lock, P1 must wait
until P0 unlocks. So, you promote the priority of P0 to equal that of P1
and then P2 runs and reaches the lock. Then P0 is promoted again etc.
Or worse, as in my example, P0 has lock L0 and P1 locks L1 and then 
hangs on L0, and P3 locks L3 and then L2 .... so that priority promotions
are cascaded

This is one of the choices of wrong answers. Suppose P0 has lock L0
and lock L1 and gets promoted on both of them. If unlocking either
returns P0 to its original priority then you still have inversion, if
you need to look at all held locks/resources then you have a rather
significant overhead.

See above.

Not in the soft RT scheme.

That is a much better solution. It's compatible with the general
unix design and can be implemented very efficiently.
