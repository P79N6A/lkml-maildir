Hi,
For the three people who don't monitor the security
websites, there are claims that Linux' random number
generator has problems that could potentially be
exploited by an attacker to compromise encryption
algorithms, etc.

(Just because something is claimed does not make it
so, but it's usually worth checking.)
I know there have been patches around for ages to
improve the entropy of the random number generator,
but how active is work on this section of the code?
