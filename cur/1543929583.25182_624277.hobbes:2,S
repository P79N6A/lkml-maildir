We can but it will likely take a few weeks to get a good sampling. UUID 
is unique in the db so when someone checks in with the same UUID, the 
old one gets overwritten. I'll have to do regular copies of what the 
UUID holds over time. Smolt schedules a monthly check in which we 
literally just missed a few days ago.

We'll be able to get lots of stuff. Here's a profile of whats currently 
in e2b67e1d-e325-4740-b938-795addb45280.

I'll grab the suspect UUID profiles over time to see what we end up with.
