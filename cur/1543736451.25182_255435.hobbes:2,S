I repeat: the Linux client is apparently better off ignoring it totally.
That makes it meaningless, Jeremy. 
  meaningless (vs. meaningful), nonmeaningful -- (having no meaning or
	direction or purpose; "a meaningless endeavor"; "a meaningless
	life"; "a verbose but meaningless explanation")
It clearly has no meaning or direction or purpose for any sane client.
After all, the only thing we can use it for is st_blocks, and since the 
granularity is _so_ big, we're much better off looking at the file size 
and guessing from that.
I still don't see why you argue for that totally meaningless number. As 
far as I can tell, the _only_ thing it matters for is some Windows 
benchmark.
Tell me again: why should the Linux client look at that number? Give me 
just _one_ valid reason.
