It's probably a very small number that I'm chasing with avoiding blk
layer tagging.  Nevertheless, any number no matter how small, is a gold
mine to me :-)
Latest execution profile taken with 2.6.14-rc2 kernel with "industry
standard transaction processing database workload".  First column is
clock ticks (a direct measure of time), 2nd column is instruction
retired,
and 3rd column is number of L3 misses occurred inside the function.
Symbol			Clockticks	Inst. Retired	L3 Misses
scsi_request_fn		8.12%	9.27%	11.18%
Schedule			6.52%	4.93%	7.26%
scsi_end_request		4.44%	3.59%	6.76%
__blockdev_direct_IO	4.28%	4.38%	3.98%
__make_request		3.59%	4.16%	3.47%
__wake_up			2.46%	1.56%	3.33%
dio_bio_end_io		2.14%	1.67%	3.18%
aio_complete		2.05%	1.27%	3.56%
kmem_cache_free		1.95%	1.70%	0.71%
kmem_cache_alloc		1.45%	1.84%	0.45%
put_page			1.42%	0.60%	1.27%
