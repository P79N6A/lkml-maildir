but how can the system know if the directory the user wants to add is 
reasonable or not? what if the user says they want to store their 
documents in /etc?

a question for Crispin,
   is there a wildcard replacement for username? so that you could grant 
permission to /home/$user/.mozilla...... and grant each user access to 
only their own stuff? I realize that in this particular example the 
underlying DAC will handle it, but I can see other cases where people may 
want to have users more intermixed (say webserver files or directories for 
example)

the model of being able to add restrictions would still handle this. make 
two shell scripts (one to start each browser profile) and set the AA 
policy for these scripts to only have access to the appropriate 
directories.
