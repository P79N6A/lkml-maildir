The users that I spoke to from the financial sector that tried it are 
still quite interested. One simple use case for them is a very large 
cluster of NFS clients for read-mostly workloads (say, 1000 or more NFS 
clients for shared system partitions). They like the ability to do 
persistent caching across reboots which allows them to have less (and 
less beefy) NFS servers for all of those boxes trying to reboot at once.
The other use case was for the large rendering customers, but I don't 
have first hand knowledge of the details...
