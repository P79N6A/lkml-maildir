Wow. The 612 really sucked badly here. I think this is the only
time I've seen 'even_faster' lose.  A few people (myself included)
have in the past talked about making the memory copy routines
do a boot time benchmark somewhat like the RAID code does to deduce
the best.  Seeing results like this makes me really believe this is
the way forward.
With something like that inplace, we could then have seperate
implementations for each processor revision if needbe without
pessimising for earlier revisions.
