That seems like a hackish thing to do.  Could you mistake other pages 
with the same count as pages you have reserved?

This suggests a problem with RHEL3.  If it works fine on a vanilla 2.4 
kernel, then by all means try to get support from your vendor.  If it 
works fine on the latest 2.4.X and 2.6.X linux-kernel is probably not 
the best place to look for help, although I can't blame you for trying.  
Maybe someone here already knows the answer, but unfortunately, it is 
not me.
Sorry if I missed context from your earlier posts.
