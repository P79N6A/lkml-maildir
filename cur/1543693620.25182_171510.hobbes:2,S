That depends on what you're doing. It can be lower cost to have threads
putting fd's on a chain to be serviced by another thread than to start
another thread to do the service and use IPC to do serialization
between threads. And abstractions like SysV message queues are
inherently shared. Sometimes there are savings to be had by sharing.
Your base point that resources shouldn't be shared needlessly is
correct, or course.
