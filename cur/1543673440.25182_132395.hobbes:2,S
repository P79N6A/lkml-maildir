In part they do - the patch gives us a guaranteed process context for
the pcmcia event stuff.  The process context is provided in the right
place (core pcmcia code).
Things left in this area are:
- Remove workqueues from socket drivers.
- I'd like to see struct pcmcia_driver expand to include more
  functions (card removal, insertion, etc) rather than having
  an event handler.
- Remove the card removal event timers from pcmcia drivers.
