Hi everyone,
I've been having a problem for a while now with a strange lockup induced
under heavy SCSI I/O (particularly when I write directly to block devices
with dd of=/dev/sd?, but also when writing to a filesystem on that
device).  I'm writing around 50-100mb/sec over FC (qlogic 2200) under
Linux 2.4 (tried 2.4.3 through 2.4.10).
It seems that some vm or I/O related spinlock is being taken and held, but
not released (?).  There is no oops or BUG() or anything (no messages at
all in fact).. all I/O just stops.  I can still invoke sysrq, type
characters at the console, etc.  In fact, usually top continues to run and
display kswapd as the dominant process.
Any ideas?
