Hi, I havent posted here before, but I have noticed a problem with
2.1.132 (dunno if it is fixed with other versions)
System Details
  Redhat 5.2
  Kernel 2.1.132
  XServer Accelerated X v1.2 from XIS
  US Robotics Modem on ttyS1
  Mouse (microsoft) on cua0
Problem
  When I connect to my ISP and am running X, I notice that if I do not
  move the mouse in a while, download stops, moving the mouse, then causes
  a glut of downloads in my browser window.
  If left long enough, this causes my link to timeout.
  Any comments?
