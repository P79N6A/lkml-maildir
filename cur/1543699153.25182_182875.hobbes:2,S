The one of main benefits I considered when focusing my attention on
devfs-like approach is space consumption. Somewhat-populated dev
subdirectory (looking at fedora 1) have about 7k items inside, each of
them eating its inode and (depends on underlying fs) a block.
I agree that previous implementation may be racy, domb, gooched,
whatever.
but
is it sane that for system to function correcly I should carry over
a whole bunch of directory entries, when I actually have all
information about it in kernel, somewhere buried under major-minor
declarations. 
That is, udev backed on tmpfs approach are almost
solving our problem. But not completely. Module autoloading is useful,
actually, was useful in conjunction with module unloading - if
unloading support is poor autoloading is almost useless ...
