The original Andre's patch was about 60k in size, and added code that
gone to great lengths (I still don't understand why it was *that*
complicated, I think it was changing quite a bit of unrelated stuff
Andre wasn't speaking about, too) to pass only the
absolutely-sure-to-be-completely-safe commands (only read & get info,
one set config command) to the drive from userland.
This of course doesn't prevent anyone from doing anything with the drive
from kernel, or from userland using direct access.
It also removed the possibility to use the possibly-dangerous-but-useful
sort of commands from userland in a clean way using the ioctl.

Actually the chances that a buggy program gone wild will by accident
open /dev/hda and trigger this exact ioctl with the command data set so
that it'd damage the drive is about the same that it'll write a poem on
the screen in quenya language in the same situation.
The chances aren't much less with the original protection patch
installed, either.
For programs actually using this ioctl interface (hdparm, smartd ...)
the possibility of doing damage by misfunctioning is of course greater,
but you can kill some drives using hdparm even with just the
considered-harmless commands.
