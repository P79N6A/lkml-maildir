It's not needed, the e820 maps are always correct for modern systems in
this case as far  as I know.

The i386 kernel did this always, but I intentionally removed it from the
64bit kernel because all the modern BIOS seem to correctly report holes
in this area. Only didn't do it on i386 because there were some concerns
of very old systems not doing this correctly.
My suspicion is that modern Windows systems rely on this, that is why
BIOSes typically get it correct now.
I think it should be only undone if you have a concrete case where it
breaks not just based on someone's gut feel. Sure it's not a lot of
memory, but why waste memory unnecessarily?
