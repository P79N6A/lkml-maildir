It matters immensely what the divison is because people talking doesn't
scale ..

What I'm trying to end up with is this
	drv.type = TYPE_FB0;	/* Head 0 */
	/* Rest much like PCI */
	vga_register_driver(&drv)
	drv.type = TYPE_DRI;
	vga_register_driver(&drv)
all working like the PCI API, so you get add/remove notifications, you
also don't need to modify the video and DRI drivers much. Unlike the
pci_register it allows multiple claims for each device (one memory
manager, one dri driver, up to four "heads" for now - multihead needs
more pondering perhaps)
Each of these gets notified when the others are added/removed and can
veto such an add or remove. They can also provide whatever methods it
turns out are appropriate to each other for co-ordination.
For example I can see the radeon DRM driver providing
	->queue_commands()
	->quiesce()
to the 2D driver. And the 2D driver providing
	->define_fb_layout()  for DRI to provide to X
That way it is only these calls between drivers you and the fb authors
have to argue about the functionality and interfaces between. (eg who
saves registers, which registers)
