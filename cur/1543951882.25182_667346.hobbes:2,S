Could be, although netif_stop_queue()/netif_start_queue() is done by
netif_device_detach() and netif_device_attach() respectively.
We should probably shut things down gracefully as well...not nice to
disable the clock when the MAC is in the middle of transmitting a
frame. Like I said in the introductory mail, this patch is just a quick
hack to prevent the macb from waking the system prematurely.

Right, it's on my todo list.
