Supposing you know the path in one tree, you know the path in all of them, 
right? :-?

These are ofcourse not necesary. If you discount the time updatedb itself 
takes it's utterly obvious that _if_ you use it, it's going to be wildly 
faster than find.
Regardless, I'll stand by "[by disabling updatedb] the problem will for a 
large part be solved" as I expect approximately 94.372 percent of Linux 
desktop users couldn't care less about locate.
