since the call to device_del() will occur while the pm_sleep_rwsem is
still locked for writing.  That's why I suggested not unregistering
these devices until after everything else has been resumed and the
rwsem has been dropped.
Another thing to watch out for: Just in case somebody ends up calling
destroy_suspended_device(dev) from within dev's own resume method, you 
should interchange the resume_device() and the list_move_tail() 
calls in dpm_resume().
