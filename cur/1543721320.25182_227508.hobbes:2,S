  By the way, right now smartctl doesn't seem to work at all with SATA using 
the libata drivers, because AFAIK libata hasn't been taught to pass through 
the required S.M.A.R.T commands to the drive yet.
  Does anyone know how difficult is this to code, or if it is necessary to 
change the scsi layer as well as libata? I'm willing to assist in testing any 
patches to add the possibility of using smartmontools with libata drivers.
