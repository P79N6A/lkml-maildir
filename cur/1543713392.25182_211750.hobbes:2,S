Subject: fat32 all upper-case filename problem

I've run across an interesting problem with creating all upper-case 
files/direcotries on fat32 partitions.  After creating a file in all upper-case, 
I can access it for a short time using either the all upper-case name or the all 
lower-case name.  After a short amount of time (or a umount/mount), I can only 
access the file via the all lower-case name.  I'm currently using kernel 2.6.4, 
but I've been seeing this since at least November of last year.
I've talked to a few people to see if anyone else can reproduce this and so far, 
I'm the only one that has been able to (save for the person that reported this 
bug 
http://bugs.xiph.org/show_bug.cgi?id=413
).  Please CC any replies to me as I 
am not subscribed to the list.
Thanks,
