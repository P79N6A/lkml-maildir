Hello,
We are using SMC Ether II cards (epic100 driver) on a few machines
here (10 machines, Asus P2B mother board Celeron 333 or Asus SMP MB
with dual PII 400), and it is working fine with every kernels ranging from
2.2.5 to 2.2.12 (not tried before 2.2.5). So far so good.
I recently received a new machine : PIII 500, Asus P3BF mother board,
SMC Ether II card.
I am unable to get it work properly. Network installation is not working
(RH 6.1, RH 6.0), whether NFS or FTP. Once installed (from a CDROM),
NFS dies or the whole machine freezes. If I install a tulip (21140)
card, everything is OK again. Of course, nothing indicating any trouble
in the logs.
So, 2 questions : is the new combination PIII/MB P3BF/SMC incompatible ?
Could a newer driver help (1.06) ?
Thanks in advance,
A+,
