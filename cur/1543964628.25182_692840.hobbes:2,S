In that case yes, network will _not_ be saturated and multiple
simultaneous streams will have a win, but POHMELFS client design was
specially created to increase network performance as much as possible,
since we can increase storage speed (add more drives, more RAM
for caches, better hardware), but can not easily increase network
bandwidth.
But, as was already noted, even being network bound, client-to-many
is likely a better solution from other points of view (like management
and/ro failure cases).
