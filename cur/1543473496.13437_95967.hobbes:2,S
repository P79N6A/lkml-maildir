The put_filp functions get's only used in the loop.c device code.
However the only place where I can see it there is after
get_write_acess() fails.
Where does the corresponding struct pointer get freed then if in regular
use?
Therefore I'm thinkging this may be well just an indication of a bug
in loop.c or the put_filp isn't necessary at all. Second thing is that
I don't see it doing proper locking handling anyway...
