Ah ok :)
Maybe my intentions were not clear :
I am not suggesting replacing all jiffies to jiffies_32. Just *selected* ones :)
BTW, the real limit is 2^31 ticks, so its 24 days.
We definitly *like* being able to use bigger timeouts on 64bits platforms.
Not that they are mandatory since the same application should run fine on 
32bits kernel. But as the standard type for 'tick timestamps' is 'unsigned 
long', a change would be invasive.
Maybe some applications are now relying on being able to 
sleep()/select()/poll() for periods > 30 days and only run on 64 bits kernels.
