Humpf. that was meant to be one of those "so obvious I can't screw it
up" patches.
typedef unsigned long ext2_fsblk_t;
typedef int ext2_grpblk_t;
in ext2_alloc_blocks we do change from "unsigned long long" to
"unsigned long" for new_blocks[], but akpm thinks that was garbage
before (same for ext2_alloc_branch's current_block)
The ext2_grpblk_t ones all look innocuous.
