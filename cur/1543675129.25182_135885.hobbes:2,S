an accurate evaluation can't be made from such comparison, but I never
claimed that to be an accurate evaluation, I just said we don't need to
worry, == "can't be too bad".
I just said it can't be too bad. and this is true, you even admit that a
readahead change for sure has more impact than whatever change the
fix-pausing generated. That's all I meant. Can't be too bad. the fact
mainline doesn't do readahead properly is much worse thing than whatever
slowdown can be generated by the fix pausing.
Furthmore I said we can deduce the accurate numbers from bigbox.html,
with very minor changes (not 2.4 vs 2.5) that as well shows the fix for
the deadlock not measurable as far as I can tell.
