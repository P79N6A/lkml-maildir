The X servers have some nasty bugs when resetting the video hardware back 
to vga mode with vgacon. XF4 for the ATI 128 only problem is the console
colors for vgacon are inverted. The XF 3.3.6 server work fine as well as
using fbdev with XF4. The reason being is fbdev cleans up after the X
server where vgacon doesn't know how properly. The X servers need to
fixed.
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
