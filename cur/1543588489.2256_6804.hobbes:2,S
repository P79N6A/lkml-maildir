Not sure what you have in mind exactly, but there are related
projects:
 - the crypto modules in the international linux kernel
   (see 
http://encryptionhowto.sourceforge.net/Encryption-HOWTO.html
)
 - Erik Zadok's FIST (
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/research/fist/
)
 - the Transparent Cryptographic File System (
http://www.tcfs.it/
)
 - Stefan Ludwig's Fairly Secure File System 
  (
http://osg.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/publikat/da/00/Ludwig00.pdf,
   diploma thesis, in German)
 - Allan Latham's practical privacy disc (device) driver
   (
http://linux01.gwdg.de/~alatham/ppdd.html
)
 - Matt Blaze's CFS seems to be discontinued/unsupported
   (
http://koeln.ccc.de/~drt/crypto/cfs-linux-HOWTO.txt
)
Maybe you clarify what exactly you want to achieve/improve compared
to the existing projects.
