Well certainly anyone with windows that needed a driver for their sata
controller better have a floppy drive (well apparenly vista now knows
about these amazing things called usb and optical drives... :).  I also
find them handy as an emergency grub boot method, although I guess most
new machines could boot that from cd if necesary.
Personally I just stick in a $25 floppy and usb memory card reader in
one.  Very handy, and doesn't waste space that way.
