Why is that a problem? You cant rip code from the kernel before the main
kinit has support for that removed feature. Thats obvious.
I dont use suspend, so I dont know how the existing in-kernel code has to
look in kinit.
But for the partition discovery (the ROOT_DEV users) its likely less than
100 lines of code. And after all, root= exists. Probably not a big loss if
that code just disappears.
I dont get your point.
