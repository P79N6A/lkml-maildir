Just because it's present in current code it doesn't mean it's right.
Calling aops directly from generic code is a layering violation and
it will not survive 2.5.

Separating a stackalbe encryption block device from the loop driver is
a good idea.  The current loop code is a horrible mess because it tries
to do the job of three drivers in one.

No, tmpfs also does not use generic_file_read but a sligh variation,
calling do_generic_file_read on tmpfs inodes will not always works as
expected.  Don't do it.

loop on nfs, do_generic_file_read is called without the needed 
nfs_revalidate_inode, thus i_size is outdated, and loop might happily
read out of the filesize.

This is true for filesystems like nfs (above) that only revalidate and then
call generic_file_read.  For totally different implementations anything can
happen.  Even if it mostly works it's not the kind of design we want to have
in the kernel.
