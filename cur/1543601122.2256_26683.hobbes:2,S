Actually, I'd say that practically *all* the categories used for ethernet  
cards are confusing. I certainly often end up backtracking several times  
when configuring a new machine.
Just throwing the lot out and using a flat list would be better than the  
current state.
Bad category strategies:
* Brand name. Drivers serve different brands.
* Bus type. Drivers serve cards on different bus types.
* Speed. Drivers serve cards capable of different speeds.
I really don't know what's left.
Unless, of course, mentioning one driver several places becomes possible.  
Then all these arguments become irrelevant.
