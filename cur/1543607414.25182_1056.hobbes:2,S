On the dependency case for x86 I have a fun common example.
To shut off the cpu, or the whole motherboard I need to talk to the
southbridge.  To talk to the southbridge, I need to talk to the northbridge.
So at least to some extent shutting down busses is a really different
case from shutting down devices.  And only in some cases can a tree
model it at all.
Equally fun are temperature monitors that appear on both the lpc/isa bus
and the i2c bus.
Or another fun common one.  To shut down the interrupt controller, I first
need to shut down every device that thinks it can generate interrupts.
But my interrupt controller is way out on my pci->isa bridge.  So I
can't shut that device down.
Sorry this whole device tree idea for shutdown ordering doesn't seem
to match my idea of reality.
Now I need to take a little time out and see what the code that is
being discussed will actually do about situations like the above.

Agreed.
