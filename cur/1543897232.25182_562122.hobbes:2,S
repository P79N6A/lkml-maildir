When I started the firewire work, I wasn't aware that tasklets were
going away, but I knew that doing too much work in the interrupt handler
was frowned upon, for good reasons.  So I was looking at softirqs vs
taslkets, and since using softirqs means you have to go add yourself to
the big bitmask, I opted for tasklets.  The comment in interrupt.h
directly recommends this.  As it stands, the firewire stack does
actaully rely on the non-reentrancy of tasklets, but that's not a
deal-breaker, I can add the necessary locking.

Sounds like this will fill the gap.  Of course, this won't reduce the
number of delayed-execution mechanisms available...
