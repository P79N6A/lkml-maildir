Ok, so you _are_ advocating _true_ capability support in the fs, ext3 most
likely.  That's _definitely_ what I want eventually, but I feel the latest
incarnation of the stickybit solution takes quite a few steps in the right
direction.  Really, it can be done 99% in userspace, with kernel mods
that:
- interpret stickybit + immutable as 'capability enabled' and read the
capabilities from the elf headers.  Pavel's patch could be so modified
very easily, IMO.
- insure that any process attempting to set the sticky bit or create a
file with the sticky bit set have CAP_SETFCAP; on success both sticky bit
and immutable are set.  This way, tar (for example) can be easily and
painlessly capability modified (with permitted==0, inheritable having at
least CAP_SETFCAP) 
I _think_ everything else can be done in userspace, so this looks to put
very little 'hair' in the kernel.

Well, people have pointed out correctly that this solution will differ
markedly from traditional UNIX.  No doubt about it, capabilities is a
different way of doing things, but a hurdle I'm more than happy to leap.

And not at all what I'm proposing.

Very little hair, very simple IMHO.

Fixed.

Also done.

Certainly not true caps in the fs, but I think this takes us very far (90%
at least) and very quickly.  An excellent candidate, I believe, for a
kernel option to be marked [experimental].  The 'upgrade' path would be
simple as well; in the presence of a suitable fs, a very simple utility
could convert from this system to true fs caps.
