  Is there any easy way to get things like the stuff that it
is in libgcc1.a into the Linux kernel? I have need for 64/32 integer divide
(gcc calls __udivdi3).
  This is with 2.2.10, on a Lintel box, and I'm using a module.
  I noticed that printk() doesn't have support for 64 bit quantities either.
