My kernel is (necessarily) linux-2.6.16
That is clearly the issue. Thank you! 
I see such a target in the top level Makefile of linux-2.6.23.
Though, I am curious how people accomplished this before the special
target was introduced. That would be very useful to know. My
understanding was that running "make menuconfig" specifically would
write the include files (afterward I will build glibc using this
kernel's headers). In particular, I read that I'd know when the header
config process was complete by the existence of the file
"/include/linux/version.h"./  Though, I am not seeing this file or other
header files.
