That works nicely.
	alias eth1 foo
	probe foo bar 3c59x   (or `probe foo 3c59x bar')
# modprobe foo (or eth1)
# lsmod

I'll play with this further in a week or two.  Would the PCMCIA-HOWTO be an
appropriate place to document this trick?
A question for Keith:
If we have:
	probe 3c575_cb 3c575_cb 3c59x
How does the `options' statement bind?  Will
	options 3c575_cb debug=3
work correctly regardless of which driver is loaded, or do we need
	options 3c575_cb debug=3
	options 3c59x debug=3
