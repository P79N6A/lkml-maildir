Bug reports, please. What we don't know about, we can't fix.
As of this commit:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=0bfefc46dc028df60120acdb92062169c9328769
XFS should be handling all cases of -EOPNOTSUPP for barrier
I/Os. If you are still having problems, please let us know.
Cheers,
Dave.
