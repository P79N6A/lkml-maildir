How would you feel about COMMAND_COMPLETE -> SPI_MSG_COMMAND_COMPLETE,
possibly even turning them into an enum, and putting them in the new
file <scsi/spi.h>?
That would get us out of the problems with SBP defining different numbers
for the same constants.  sbp2 (a) wouldn't include <scsi/spi.h> and (b)
would use an SBP_MSG_ prefix anyway

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
