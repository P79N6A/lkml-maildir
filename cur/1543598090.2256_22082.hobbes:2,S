hi,
just now I tried to compile some module and noticed that it doesnt
compile anymore because "macro min used with only two arguments".
I had some "#define min(a,b) (a<b?a:b)" myself.
I then found min() being defined in <linux/kernel.h> with an additional
type argument and some superfluos (imo) assignment code. Erm. What's going
next, drawing elipses in kernel?
I'm also missing some comment who added min/max to kernel.h, at least
I want to know who I am going to flame :->
