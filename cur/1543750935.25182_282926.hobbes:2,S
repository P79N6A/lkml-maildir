Eh? "you should avoid Linux - experimental project indeed!". Sad, but 
this is almost true already: can you name the stable version of the 
kernel which is in main public use? When I take a look from distros then:
Mandrake 10.2 snapshot (Cooker): kernel-2.6.8.1.20mdk-1-1mdk.i586.rpm
SuSe (SRPM for new 9.2): kernel-source-2.6.8-24.src.rpm
Fedora (update for FC3): kernel-2.6.9-1.724_FC3.i686.rpm
And inside proper .src.rpm-s are lot of stuff. So how those fixes inside 
2.6.10 will reach the end-user? 2.6.[x < 10] + patch+patch+patch...
It means that for end user (me) the stable kernel 2.6.10 is not just 
usable. And of course I will not test any vanilla kernel because my MIDI 
programs-devices/USB gadgets/connect+point+and+click will usually stop 
working by reasons which are not bug but implementation related. So what 
I should report to my distro provider? Please recode this program 
because i am keen to test newest kernel? But how then should I provide 
my help with kernel testing?
Maybe you need to set up a pool of patches with full detailed information:
- bug fixes
- security related fixes
- feature changes
- status flag: test/stable
- dependencies :)
This is what is needed - how and when a 2.6.x stable kernel will have 
released (strategy of kernel development) is not a question at all. 
Vanilla kernel will never reach end-users anyway.
OK, don't take it too seriously :)

Indrek
