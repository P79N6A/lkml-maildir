No, you have accepted a non-portable userspace interface and put it in
generic code.  THAT is idiotic.
So any program that doesn't use the following is broken:
	#include <limits.h>
	#define BITS_PER_LONG (sizeof(long)*CHAR_BIT)
	int set_cpu(int cpu)
	{
		size_t size = sizeof(unsigned long);
		unsigned long *bitmask = NULL;
		int ret;
		do {
			size *= 2;
			bitmask = realloc(bitmask, size);
			memset(bitmask, 0, size);
			bitmask[cpu / BITS_PER_LONG] = (1 << (cpu % BITS_PER_LONG);
			ret = sched_setaffinity(getpid(), size, bitmask);
		} while (ret < 0 && errno = -EINVAL);
		return ret;
	}

Just bind to a cpu != those two CPUs.  I could come up with contrived
examples too, but I'm trying to save userspace programmers and those
who have to port to new architectures.
If you don't know how to do it well, do it simply.
