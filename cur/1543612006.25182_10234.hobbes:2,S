We have actually moved our code to another Dell 4400 we got at the
same time (in theory the same exact same system) and I rebuilt the
kernel with the same .config file and I am getting different memory
usage patterns.
The first system I tried was Red Hat 7.1, it never used more then 2G
of cache memory leaving the other 2G free.
The other system, Mandrake 8.0, sucks up all the 4G of memory with
cache but has not yet shown any signs of thrashing.  Though the code
has only been running a few hours.
Could this be a C compiler issue?
