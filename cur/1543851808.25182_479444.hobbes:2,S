Subject: [PATCH] input: map BTN_FORWARD to button 2 in mousedev
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Márton Németh <nm127@freemail.hu>
In mousedev the BTN_LEFT and BTN_FORWARD were mapped to mouse button 0, causing
that the user space program cannot distinguish between them through /dev/input/mice.
The BTN_FORWARD is currently used in the synaptics.c, logips2pp.c and in alps.c. All
mice have BTN_LEFT, but not all have BTN_MIDDLE (e.g. Clevo D410J laptop). Mapping
BTN_FORWARD to mouse button 2 makes the BTN_FORWARD button useful on the mentioned
laptop.

The Clevo D410J laptop has "AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint" touchpad having the following
physical layout:
     +-------------------+ +-------------+ +-------------------+
     |                   | | BTN_FORWARD | |                   |
     |     BTN_LEFT      | +-------------+ |     BTN_RIGHT     |
     |                   | +-------------+ |                   |
     |                   | |  BTN_BACK   | |                   |
     +-------------------+ +-------------+ +-------------------+
This model does not have any BTN_MIDDLE, but the BTN_FORWARD could be used instead.
The following table summarizes the map changes:
     Button name  | Mapping in 2.6.19-rc3 | The changed mapping

     BTN_LEFT     |          0            |          0
     BTN_RIGHT    |          1            |          1
     BTN_FORWARD  |          0            |          2
     BTN_BACK     |          3            |          3
