Hi,
I'm setting up a new server with Intel 82559 LOM (733470-066),
this is ASUS CUR-DLS.
While testing the NIC performance with eepro100 driver,
I was getting those famous "card reports no resources" and "too much 
work in interrupt".
The perfomance test was actually a "ping -f -s 65507"
from another host (both hosts are in 100baseTX-FD IBM switch)
and some other program doing basicly the same.
I played around with module parameters but had no luck.
So I've had to try the Intel supplied driver *e100-1.5.5a*.
ftp://download.intel.com/df-support/2250/eng/e100-1.5.5a.tar.gz
And it works just rock&solid - no problems at all.
