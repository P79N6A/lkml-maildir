Sorry, this isn't going to work.
Please post a diff with the changes you did to the driver, and whatever
output you got when it crashed.
It's really difficult to help you when I don't know (a) what code
you're actually running, or (b) anything about the crash.

No, it's only called from the tasklet, and the interrupt handler doesn't
touch the TX data register. There shouldn't be any need to disable
interrupts around the call to atmel_tx_chars(). In fact, this may very
well be the cause of the overruns you're seeing.
