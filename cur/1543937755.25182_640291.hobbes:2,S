[ Sidenote: "too small" and "too insignificant" is not a patch attribute
  that is in my vocabulary - by definition the best patches are very
  small and very insignificant (they just happen to end up doing
  something cool a 1000 steps later ;-) 99% of our problems come from
  'too large' and 'too intrusive' patches. ]
