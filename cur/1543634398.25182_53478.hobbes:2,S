probably a driver issue with hw checksum. btw interestingly the stack
computes the cksum by hand for every tcp incoming packet (unless
ip_summed is set by the driver to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY), this is how it
noticed the hw checksum was wrong. I guess it's either an e100 driver
issue, or an hardware issue. Maybe it's setting DF_CSUM_OFFLOAD for your
card despite your hardware doesn't support that feature, or maybe
there's something wrong in the logic that sets the skb->csum.
