One thing that seems to be missing in Linux are proper VM
statistics. There is no way handwaving and discussions are
going to be better than a measurement of what's going on
inside the VM.
Treating the different VM patch sets as black boxes with
benchmarks will show us which VM works best for which
benchmark, but it won't show us why or how to combine the
good features of the different VMs...
I think good statistics to start would be the traditional
page fault rate (pf), page free rate (fr), page scan rate
(sr), reclaims (re), pageout (po), pagein (pi) and some
variation of iowait stats.
regards,
Rik
