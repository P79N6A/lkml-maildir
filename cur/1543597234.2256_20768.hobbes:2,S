Probably not:
        #define TUNSETNOCSUM  _IOW('T', 200, int)
        #define TUNSETDEBUG   _IOW('T', 201, int)
        #define TUNSETIFF     _IOW('T', 202, int)
        #define TUNSETPERSIST _IOW('T', 203, int)
        #define TUNSETOWNER   _IOW('T', 204, int)
Which is (apart from some extensions) the same as it ever was. However 
adding a
	printk(KERN_INFO "tun_chr_ioctl() called with cmd=%4.4X
		(TUNSETIFF=%4.4X, tun is%s set)\n",
		cmd, TUNSETIFF, tun? "":" not");
in tun_chr_ioctl() reveals:
	tun_chr_ioctl() called with cmd=54CA (TUNSETIFF=400454CA, tun is not set)
Now, where does the 0x400454CA come from? What happened to the _IOW()
macros? (Tested with 2.4.6 vanilla kernel sources and gcc-2.95.3)
And BTW, you shouldn't include kernel headers from user space programs,
should you.
