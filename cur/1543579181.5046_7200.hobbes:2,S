Hi Phil,
I've forwarded it for you, however you likely didn't realize hat
lkml is an "open" mailing list, ie: you don't need to be a
subscriber to post.  This is so that non-members can file bug
reports, and send spam, etc..  ;o)
Take care.

Hi Mike!
I'm not on lkml but I follow the discussions from time to time and saw your
mail.
(as I'm not subscribed, please forward this to lkml)
I've had the same problem using DLink 530 using 10baseT. DOS-diagnostic
said "No connection". Even trying to say
	modprobe tulip options=1
(use 10baseT) didn't work.
Then I got a crossed 10base2 cable and - IT WORKED (for me) without any
problems, though I said option=4 (10base2, full duplex).
Hope this helps!
Regards,
Phil
