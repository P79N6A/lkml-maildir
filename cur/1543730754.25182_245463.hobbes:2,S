Files and directories are not different in that respect - the only overhead
is price of hash lookup when crossing the binding in either case.  1000
bindings shouldn't be a problem - it's 3--5 per hash chain.  Wrt memory,
it's one struct vfsmount allocated per binding - IOW, about 80Kb total
for 1000 of those.
