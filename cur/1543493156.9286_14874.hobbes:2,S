I guess I misunderstand the concept here.  I thought that capabilities were
a mechanism to allow one to be more selective in allowing root permissions
to non-root userids (so that you don't have to give out "root" userids).

I shouldn't be able to do this (and can't) because my userid doesn't have
permission to create files under /  -- what did you mean here?

presuming the file is there, there is no problem deleting it:
[pjoot@openfire cap]$ ./debugwrap touch /blah
[pjoot@openfire cap]$ ls -l /blah
-rw-r--r--   1 root     build           0 Apr 17 15:04 /blah
[pjoot@openfire cap]$ ./debugwrap rm /blah
[pjoot@openfire cap]$ ./debugwrap ls /blah
ls: /blah: No such file or directory
It seems to me that when we have removed all root capabilities except
ptrace this shouldn't be allowed.
This seems to be a particularity to create files as root.  ./debugwrap
doesn't allow me to mount filesystems (CAP_SYS_PACCT), as I would expect
since we have removed this capability.
