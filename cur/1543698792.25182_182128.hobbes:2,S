I agree with this patch.  It fixes the usbserial oops for me in my
testing.  
But wait, no, this patch is not good...
I think Mike's patch is correct.  Here's the problem (tree simplified
for this example to make it readable):
	- insert usb device, this creates a sysfs directory something
	  like:
		- pci.../usb1/1.0
	- the usbserial driver binds to this device and creates a
	  ttyUSB0 directory:
	  	- pci.../usb1/1.0/ttyUSB0
	- a user opens the ttyUSB0 device node (in /dev) which
	  increments the reference count of the kobject that controls
	  the ttyUSB0 directory in sysfs.
	- the usb device is removed from the system.  In doing this,
	  the driver core, and then the kobject code has to delete the
	  tree 1.0 directory.  
Now at this point, Maneesh, your patch would prevent this directory from
being removed, until after the ttyUSB0 directory is removed.  That's all
well and good, but what happens if we have another USB device plugged
into the same place before this happens.  Then the USB code would try to
create the 1.0 directory over again (the directory names are built off
of the USB topology.  but even if they were built off of something
unique, we would still have a mess...)  If that happens, the creation of
the directory would fail, which is not acceptable.
But Mike's patch allows the whole tree from 1.0 on down to be removed,
and then later, when the ttyUSB0 node is really closed, the directory
will not tried to be removed.  Memory is still cleaned up properly, and
the kobjects are properly reference counted.
I know in the past I've argued against this kind of patch (sorry scsi
people), but now in thinking about it a bunch (and sitting though a
zillion oops messages trying to figure out what's wrong here) I think
this is the correct fix.
Any other opinions?
thanks,
