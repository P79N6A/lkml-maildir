Hmm. Speaking of dbench, I tried the combination of 2.4.16,
your 2.4.16 low latency patch, and the IO scheduling patch
on my dual PIII.
After starting it up I did a dbench 32 on a 180 GB reiserfs
running on software RAID 5, just to see if it would
fall over, and during the run I got the following error/
warning message printed about 20 times on the console 
and in the kernel log:
vs-4150: reiserfs_new_blocknrs, block not free<4>
Took it to single user mode after that and ran reiserfsck, 
which printed a lot of stuff but I don't think it found any
problems.
Went back to 2.4.15-pre5 and could not reproduce the problem
on that kernel.
