Reset would simplify the code, but also make boot time longer :( I'd
rather sacrifice the code in this case. Actually, it was reset that had
been done in original patch for UHCI and I think was taken from
reset_hc(). Moreover, if one can detect that UHCI has been initialized
in the BIOS already, and just halt it - 60ms reset delay can be avoided
at boot time in the driver as well. 
Not sure about reoder though.
Aleks.
