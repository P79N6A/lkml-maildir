Breaking the device drivers, protocol stacks, disk drivers, file
systems, etc. out of the kernel  proper and forcing them to always be
loadable modules would achieve this end with the added benefit of
allowing folks to plug in their own optimized binary versions -- Like
NetWare and NT are today.  The only nasty place I can think of where
this won't work well is the incestuous hooking of block_read/block_write
functions which seens prevalant in the drivers to always force drivers
into the buffer cache.  Having an alternate debugger interface in the
kernel that's loadable would also be really nice since it would allow me
to plug in the MANOS kernel debugger into the kernel proper (and speed
up our development by a factor of 20) rather than forcing us to use code
reviews and that putrid hacked up gdb variant to debug the kernel (which
is useless for SMP drivers).
