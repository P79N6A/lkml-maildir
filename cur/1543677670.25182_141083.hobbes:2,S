  [PATCH] Fix shmctl(SHM_LOCK/UNLOCK) deadlock

  Yes, worth fixing in 2.4.21, thanks Andrea:
  shmem_lock tried for a semaphore while sys_shmctl holds a spinlock.
  Patch below against 2.4.21-rc7 - Andrea's patch against his own tree
  may have deterred you!  As he said, using spin_lock here is actually
  superfluous, but raises fewer eyebrows than omitting it.  I want to
  send you patches in early 2.4.22 to bring many of the 2.5 tmpfs mods
  into 2.4, which would fix this: but the hangfix is worth taking now.

My current linux related activities in rough order of priority:
- Testing of Swsusp for 2.4

- Studying 2.5 serial and ide drivers, ACPI, S3
