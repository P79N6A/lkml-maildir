PCI Devices will not be the same on the bus since PCI read/write
functions will have different behavior. Without the patches you will
get an error when accessing ECS with CF8. We need ECS access for
patches that setups local interrupt vectors. This patches will be
released soon.
Btw, this patch fixes also config space access with proc/sys fs and
lspci. I see this as an added functionality as well.
