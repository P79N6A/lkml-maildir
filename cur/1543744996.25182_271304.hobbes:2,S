ksymoops has to work with lots of different log formats from lots of
different architectures.  Some arch's already print the code around the
oops and enclose the failing instruction in <> or [], some do not.
Just looking at a code string, you cannot tell if the arch has variable
length instructions or not (don't forget that ksymoops also works cross
architecture).  The VLI tag will work for _all_ architectures that have
variable length instructions, not just i386.  At the very least, s390
can use it as well.
There are enough ambiguity problems in ksymoops, without adding new
ones.
