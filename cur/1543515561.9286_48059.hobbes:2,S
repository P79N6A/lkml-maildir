I seen users who removed proc from there as well and got strange results.
I seen users who removed IPC from kernel and got even strangier results.
Now what ? Let's remove such choice from kernel and add automounting of
/proc ? And so on ? Guess what you'll get in the end ?

It's EXACTLY what I *HATE* in Windows: this beast knows what I want to do
far better then I am :-/ When I do /dev/pts handling some non-standard way
(with daemon, for example) I DO NOT want to scan all possible libraries where
Unix98 ptys can be used. To me situation where newcomer can hurt himseft with
removal of /dev/pts from fstab is better then situation where libraries are
using magic to keep working in misconfigured system. You can do quite a few
bad things to make you life horrible (try to remove /dev/null or remove /tmp,
for example :-) and the more magic is added in system the more troubles we'll
get in future.
P.S. There are exist tools to find out such problems (like linuxconf). Glibc
is BAD place to find and fix configuration problems...
