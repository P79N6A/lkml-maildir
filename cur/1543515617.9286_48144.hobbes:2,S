This may not be related to the BIOS at all... I remember there were some
problems when Ingo was developing his APIC cleanup patches that caused
this problem to show up as well.  I remember some posts a while ago about
some IRQs having millions of interrupts very quickly, and it went away in
later versions of Ingo's SMP patches (I think). :)
Maybe I'm not remembering correctly, but I think this is the case.
