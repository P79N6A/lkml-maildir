 Huh?  The floppies use ordinary I/O ports at the ISA bus, not the range
reserved for motherboard devices as, until quite recently, FDCs used to
exist solely as add-on cards (I still have one).  Any other ISA device is
free to use the port range if it's unused by anything else (e.g. no FDC
there).  Ditto for IRQ6 -- older cards used to have an option to use this
line, only newer ones often do not have it anymore, for unknown reason
(i.e. the cost is probably one).
