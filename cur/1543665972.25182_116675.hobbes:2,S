Read Documentation/cpu-freq/user-guide.txt
short: mount sysfs, and ..
(root@evo:cpufreq)# cd /sys/class/cpu/cpufreq/cpu0/cpufreq
(root@evo:cpufreq)# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz
cpu MHz		: 1390.536
(root@evo:cpufreq)# echo powersave >scaling_governor
(root@evo:cpufreq)# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz
cpu MHz		: 529.728
(root@evo:cpufreq)# echo performance >scaling_governor
