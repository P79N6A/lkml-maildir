If we added support for named type transitions to SELinux, as proposed
earlier by Kyle Moffett during this discussion, wouldn't that address
that issue without needing a DTE-like approach?  The concept is to add
the last component name as a further input to the labeling decision for
new files, in addition to the existing use of the creating process'
label, the parent directory label, and the kind of file.  Then, you
could have something like:
type_transition <domain> var_log_hosts_t:file "messages" messages_t;
The last component name is already available, so that doesn't require
any changes to LSM, and it would be a straightforward extension of
SELinux to support the above - it doesn't change the model at all, just
adds a further input to the new file labeling logic.
