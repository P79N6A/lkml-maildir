thanks for taking time.
I've tested it with debug tracer, it took several hours to half day to
reproduce it on my box. And I got the possible scenario.
Before begin, I can tell that se->on_rq is changed at enqueue_task() or
dequeue_task() in sched.c.
Here is the flow to panic which I got;
   CPU0                               CPU1
    |                              schedule()
    |                              ->deactivate_task()
    |                              -->dequeue_task()
    |                                  * on_rq=0
    |                              ->put_prev_task_fair()
    |                              ->idle_balance()
    |                              -->load_balance_newidle()
(a wakeup function)                    |
    |                              --->double_lock_balance()
    *get lock                          *rel lock
    * wake up target is CPU1's curr    |
->enqueue_task()                       |
    * on_rq=1                          |
->rt_mutex_setprio()                   |
    * on_rq=1, ruuning=1               |
-->dequeue_task()!!                    |
-->put_prev_task_fair()!!              |
    * sched_class is changed           |
-->set_curr_task_fair()!!              |
-->enqueue_task()!!                    |
    *rel lock                          *get lock again
    :                                  |
                                       :
                                   ->pick_next_task_fair()
                                       => panic
The difference from the previous scenario is;
some one enqueues CPU1,s current task before setprio,
it makes on_rq=1 and it causes set_curr_task_fair() called.
It means that the cfs_rq state of the current task is set to
before put_prev_task_fair(), I think.
Does this scenario help to solve this issue?
And I only test it on -rt because I can reproduce it on -rt only.
thanks,
