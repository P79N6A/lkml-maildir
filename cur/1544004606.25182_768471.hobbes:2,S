it's definitely welcome!

Some small cleanliness nits:

we should just do this unconditionally on 32-bit too.

32-bit should use oops_begin() too. Solves the previous comment as 
well.

this difference seems unnecessary too - 32-bit should use oops_end() 
too.

please fix todo ;-)
this flow could be cleaned up further:

Any reason why that pattern shouldnt be changed to an appropriate goto 
bad_area? (probably the same goes for the nosemaphore error paths too)
