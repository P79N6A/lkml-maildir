Upon maturity, my boss sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that Mr. JAMES DOBSON died from an automobile accident. On my personal further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.Further investigations were made and discovered that Mr. JAMES DOBSON did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

This will be drafted and sealed with an agreement letter on black and white that will bind both of us and guarantee our shares.
