I guess this boils down to personal preference, I like to stick
register definitions in a seperate file as well.
I think the most important issue is when doing header files to make
sure they go with the driver code and not in include/linux unless
there really is a reason to expose them to user space. No reason to
export register definitions for Ethernet cards down there.
