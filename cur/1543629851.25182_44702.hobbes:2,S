The boot kernel has a lot of it disabled not the main ones.

I can't speak directly for the Kudzu maintainer but I can say that having
a sane way to obtain the list of ide devices (all of them not just non

If 2.6 breaks a 2.4 installer and nothing else I don't think its a big 
disaster and the cleanup may well be justified
