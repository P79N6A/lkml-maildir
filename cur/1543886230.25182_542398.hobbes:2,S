Who do I ask about the status of the migration from ARCH=ppc to ARCH=powerpc?
I've been putting around with my Firmware Linux project trying to add powerpc 
as a supported platform.  I can build kernels that qemu can boot (such as 
a "prep" kernel) using ARCH=ppc, but that one doesn't support make 
headers_install.
Using ARCH=powerpc makes headers_install work, but there's no kernel .config 
I've been able to come up with that generates a kernel I can boot under qemu.
I could add a special case to my build script, but so far I've got it building 
eight targets (x86, x86-64, mips, mipsel, armv4l, armv5l, and sparc) with the 
same ARCH= for headers_install and the actual kernel compile.  It seems there 
_should_ be a way to do this for as prominent an architecture as PowerPC.
Who should I ask about this?
Rob
