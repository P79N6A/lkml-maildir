This is also possible with the GPL, see libgcc. What advantage has your

Why do you make this decision for everyone?
If I wanted to use *BSD I would use it. The point of using Linux and 
the GPL is that we at least attempt to protect the source to keep it free 
and any contribution should be given the same respect. You insist on using 
a different license, which would set a precedence with until now unknown 
consequences. Your indifference in this matter is very alarming and 
provokes only that klibc is very quickly replaced with yet another libc 
implementation.
bye, Roman
