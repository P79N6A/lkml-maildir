 OK, I definitely do not see the reported effect.  On a HP Proliant with a RAID5 on CCISS I get:
2.6.19.2: 654-738 MB/sec write, 1126-1154 MB/sec rewrite
2.6.24-rc2: 772-820 MB/sec write, 1495-1539 MB/sec rewrite
 The first run is always slowest, all subsequent runs are faster and the same speed.

 4x72GB SCSI disks building a RAID5 on a CCISS controller with battery backed write cache. Systems are 2 CPUs (64-bit) with 8 GB memory. I could test on some IBM boxes (2x dual core, 8 GB) with RAID5 on "aacraid", but I need some time to free up one of the boxes.
