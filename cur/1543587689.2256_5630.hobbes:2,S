No, I noticed this behaviour as well.  You run "lilo -v 5" once you get
one set of numbers, you run it a second time, you get another set of
numbers.  It repeats every 2 lilo runs.  I believe it has something to
do with the map file, and keeping a backup copy thereof.
Sorry, this doesn't help your RAID problem.
Note, can you boot from one of the separate RAID drives with the Debian
LILO directly?  Have you tried CHS, LBA32, and linear options to lilo?
Cheers, Andreas
