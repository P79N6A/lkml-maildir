I'm not sure it's enough to look just at the memory barriers.  The
barriers only make sense within the memory ordering model defined for
each architecture.  For ia64, this is defined in Section 4.4.7 of
the System Architecture Guide, which is available at:
 
http://developer.intel.com/design/itanium/downloads/24531803s.htm

The ia64 memory ordering model is quite orthogonal to the one that
Linux uses (which is based on the Alpha instructions): Linux
distinguishes between read and write memory barriers.  ia64 uses an
acquire/release model instead.  An acquire orders all *later* memory
accesses and a release orders all *earlier* accesses (regardless of
whether they are reads or writes).  Another difference is that the
acquire/release semantics is attached to load/store instructions,
respectively.  This means that in an ideal world, ia64 would rarely
need to use the memory barrier instruction.
Now, finding a way to abstract all the differences accross
architectures in a way that's easy to use and allows for optimal
implementation on each architecture may not be easy.  This problem
also shows up with user-level thread libraries and I have had on and
off discussions about this with Hans Boehm, but neither of us has
really had time to work on it seriously.  In truth, it is also the
case that for Itanium and Itanium 2, the cost of "mf" is small enough
that there hasn't been a huge need to get this exactly right.  But
when reworking the memory ordering model of Linux, it might just as
well be taken into account.

Look at Table 4-15 in the above document (on page 2-70).  I/O space is
simply a memory-mapped region that is mapped uncached.  In the table,
the row "Sequential" refers to uncached memory.  The quick summary is
that normal loads/stores to memory are not automatically ordered with
respect to accesses to uncached memory.
I'm also discussing some of these issues in my book
(
http://www.lia64.org/book/
) in the Device I/O chapter, but the
architecture manual mentioned above is of course the ultimate source
if you want all the gory details.
