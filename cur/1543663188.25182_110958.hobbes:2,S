I don't think it matters, the idea is to avoid all the low-level SCSI
menus in one place, without disabling the ability to handle ATAPI devices.
Using the ide-scsi or not still uses SCSI drivers AFAIK.

Have you checked/used them? I kind of wrote that off after a while, I
don't need more coasters :-( At the time I deferred testing the score was
CD: read okay burn failed, ide-floppy (ZIP in my case): ng, and tape: not
even visible. That was back around 2.5.52 or so, since ide-scsi seems to
work I haven't been motivated to care.
