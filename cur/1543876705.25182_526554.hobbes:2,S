I have an alternate suggestion for the struct page overloading issue.
I think anonymous unions are probably better than nothing, because they
make the .c code more readable, but they clutter up the header badly
and don't provide so strong type checking as we could implement.
This is just an incomplete RFC patch, because it actually requires a
fair amount of types in .c code to be changed if we are to implement it
(which I didn't want to do if nobody likes the idea).
(sorry it's an attachment, this mailer is broken)
