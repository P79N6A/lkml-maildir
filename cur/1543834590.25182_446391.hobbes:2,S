I am Cc'ing to LKML now. See below about xf86-video-ati git.
Summary: 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=374986
since 2.6.17-rcSomething X seems to fail at startup, hangs in a kind of
loop while doing
4582  rt_sigaction(SIGCHLD, {SIG_DFL}, {0x2b6d039cdd30, [INT RT_25], SA_RESTORER|SA_INTERRUPT|SA_ONESHOT|0x31f25d8, 0x2b6d039cd9e8}, 8) = ? ERESTARTNOINTR (To be restarted)
From what I can see, previous versions did not support my card at all
while in the current, /dev/dri* seems to be opened successfully before
the problem occurs:
4555  write(0, "drmOpenByBusid: Searching for Bu"..., 53) = 53
4555  geteuid()                         = 0
4555  write(0, "drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev"..., 43) = 43
4555  stat("/dev/dri", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=40, ...}) = 0
4555  stat("/dev/dri/card0", 0x7fff6e5857f0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
4555  unlink("/dev/dri/card0")          = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
4555  mknod("/dev/dri/card0", S_IFCHR|0666, makedev(226, 0)) = 0
4555  chown("/dev/dri/card0", 0, 0)     = 0
4555  chmod("/dev/dri/card0", 0666)     = 0
4555  open("/dev/dri/card0", O_RDWR)    = 7
It does not fail if dri X module is not loaded.

I fetched this one: git clone
git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/drm.git/ mesa 
and installed compiled libs over the libs from the Debian package. Has
not changed anything, unfortunately.
