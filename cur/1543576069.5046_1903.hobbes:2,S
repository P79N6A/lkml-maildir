Hi,
I found the cause. I read somewhere in a debian bugreport that bootsect.S
can't handle really big (b)vmlinuz images (over 500kb orso). However, I am
wondering why 'make bzdisk' doesn't give me an error or a warning. I mean,
the only purpose of 'make bzdisk' is to build a kernel bootable on a
floppy right?
Regards,
infernix
