This would be basically the same as moving the try_module_get/module_put 
calls from the open/close to the read/write functions.
You still need to synchronize with already running functions and if your 
that far it's probably easier to simply replace the ops pointer to get rid 
of the dead test.
This still leaves you with a very limited control of the module unloading 
process...
