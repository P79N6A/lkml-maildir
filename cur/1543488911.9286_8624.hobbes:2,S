Fair enough. That's how things are supposed to work.

The driver _can_ and _will_ catch munmaps. But I see what the problem is
now: it appears that the driver has a completely unrelated bug, which is
that it doesn't save away the file in the vma, which is why the system
gets confused: it doesn't know that the mapping still holds on to driver
resources. 
This, btw, could result in other nasty problems too, like not keeping
track of module counts correctly etc. Happily the fix is really simple.

the file release _would_ have worked just fine, except the driver
apparently doesn't install the file in the mmap at all. Which is a serious
bug anyway, because it means that the VM system doesn't even know that the
mmap() is a non-anonymous thing, and the VM system can do some very
strange things when merging and unmerging vma's.. 
Anyway, the fix should be really simple: do a 
	vma->vm_file = file;
	file->f_count++;
inside the driver mmap() routine after a successful mmap, and you're all
done, and you can remove the silly workarounds for the bug. 
Alan, it sounds like the sound drivers have the same problem, considering
that you said that they've been getting the same reports.
Btw, this is really easy to check from user mode: if you have the bug,
then the /proc/<pid>/maps file will contain bad information (it will show
up as an anonymous mapping in the maps file, rather than as a nice pointer
to the device file you mmapped). 
Maybe I should do the vm_file update inside the mm system, so that nobody
can forget this even by mistake. Hmm..
Anyway, this certainly explains everything.
