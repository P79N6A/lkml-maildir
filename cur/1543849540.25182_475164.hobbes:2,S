Ok, this sounds sane.
What should we do about this? How does this patch look to people?
(Totally untested, and I'm not sure we should even do that whole 
"oldmm->mm_users" test, but I'm throwing it out here for discussion, in 
case it matters for performance. The second D$ flush should obviously be 
unnecessary for the common unthreaded case, which is why none of this has 
mattered historically, I think).
Comments? We need ARM, MIPS, sparc and S390 at the very least to sign off 
on this, and somebody to write a nice explanation for the changelog (and 
preferably do this through -mm too).
