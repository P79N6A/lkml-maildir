Your SCSI code went the other way; the logic is about the same.
That's easy enough ... I'm not going to argue that point any longer.
The driver might even have Real Intelligence to apply.  But I wonder
how many assumptions drivers will end up making about those dma
mappings.  It may be important to expose the "logical" page size to
the driver ("don't cross 4k boundaries"); currently it's hidden.
Other than that L1_CACHE goof, it seems this was the main thing
needing to change in the I API sent by.  Sound right?  Implementation
would be a different question.  I'm not in the least attached to what
I sent by, but some implementation is needed.  Slab-like, or buddy? :)

Servers and other non-gui tools?  I don't see why not.  You can make
good systems software in many languages.  There are advantages to
not having those classes of memory-related bugs.  I'm looking forward
to GCC 3.0 with GCJ, compiling Java just like C.  But that's OT.
