Hello,
 apart from the compile-glitch with NTFS, I noticed the following glitches
in 2.2.0pre4:
* My 32-speed CD-ROM is recognized as 27-speed, and my 36-speed CD-ROM as
32-speed. This has been broken for as long as I can remember, but I've
never seen mention of such a bug on the web.
While initializing the IDE controller:
 SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
 SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
     ide0: BM-DMA at 0x4000-0x4007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
     ide1: BM-DMA at 0x4008-0x400f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
 hda: SAMSUNG WA32543A, ATA DISK drive
 hdc: SAMSUNG SCR-3230, ATAPI CDROM drive
 hdd: CD-ROM 36X/AKU, ATAPI CDROM drive
 ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
 ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
 hda: SAMSUNG WA32543A, 2442MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=620/128/63
But when the CD-ROM driver module is loaded:
 Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.51
 hdc: ATAPI 27X CDROM drive, 384kB Cache
 hdd: ATAPI 32X CDROM drive, 128kB Cache
* I found in /var/log/warn the messages:
Jan  3 21:35:59 wezel kernel: Sound: Recording overrun
Jan  3 21:36:30 wezel last message repeated 3372 times
Jan  3 21:36:43 wezel last message repeated 1558 times
The same message also spammed my complete dmesg output.
I was not recording any sound; in fact I have never played with sound
recording on linux. I *was* playing a CD, probably around that time in the
evening.
In make xconfig, I found the following quirks:
* The menu "mice" from in the mainwindow contains entries for configuring
QIC-02 tape support and Watchdog timer support: CONFIG_QIC02_TAPE,
CONFIG_QIC02_DYNCONF, CONFIG_WATCHDOG.
This must have been copied over from the original
list of character devices. Make menuconfig is correct in this respect.
* CONFIG_MOUSE is in the list of character-devices while logically it makes
more sense for the entry to be at the head of the "mice" config item. The
label might also be changed to "Support for non-serial mice" rather than
"Mouse support (not serial mice)".
* The mainwindow of xconfig is too high to fit on even a 1024x768 screen
and when I try to resize it, it invariably loses some config entry. A
scrollbar or a double row of buttons would be major plus and should be
relatively easy for someone who knows the code.
The system is SuSE 5.0 with libc5.4.44, kernel compiled with pgcc 1.1 with
-mpentium and -O2.
Pentium 200MMX, 64Mb RAM.
No patches, sorry. I thought it would be more efficient to report these
problems than to spend lots of time trying to figure things out. I'll give
more details if wanted.
Happy Hacking :-)
