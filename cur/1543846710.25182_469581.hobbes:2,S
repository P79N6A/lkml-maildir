So first you mount /dev/shm with 'noexec', thereby telling the system
"please make shared memory non executable".
Then an application goes and asks for executable shared memory, gets
denied and thus fails.  And that's a problem? It's exactely what you
asked for.
Either you want non-executable shared memory, so you mount /dev/shm
'noexec' or you want shared memory to be executable, in which case you
don't mount it 'noexec'.
As I see it, that's really all there is to it.
