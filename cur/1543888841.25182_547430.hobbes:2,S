How about just plain "console=8250,io,..."?

I don't want to add asm-ia64/fixmap.h with dummy definitions
just for this.
Can we add this:
  asm-ia64/io.h:   #define bt_ioremap ioremap
  asm-x86_64/io.h: #define bt_ioremap early_ioremap
and use bt_ioremap instead?

If you can make "console=early8250" work, we don't need
"earlycon=early8250", do we?
Your patch adds trailing whitespace and a few cases of"<space><tab>".
I use this in my .vimrc to catch these:
  highlight WhitespaceEOL ctermbg=red guibg=red
  match WhitespaceEOL /\s\+$\| \+\ze\t/
