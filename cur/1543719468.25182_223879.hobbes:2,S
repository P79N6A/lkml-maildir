Apart from electrically blowing the PS/2 port, the data format of PS/2
is well defined and fixed, whereas a UART (8250-based) port is more
flexible.  PS/2 also has the idea of acknowledgement from the peripheral
device for each byte transferred, and is synchronous, whereas UARTs
have no acknowledgement and are asyncrhonous.
So, any thought that the two ports are similar compatible with each other,
either from the electrical or protocol points of view is just a dead loss.
How do these mice work on both ports then?  They can detect which port
they're connected to and the electronics inside automatically configures
itself depending on which port they're connected to.

As from above, its more than just the input system - its the protocol
and electrical characteristics which completely rules out the
possibility - which in turn makes it nonsensible to support such an
idea in software.
