Looks like a broken udev/system-init setup, which may hang until a
timeout, while it tries to coldplug devices. When you back out the
patch, coldplug will just fail, that's why the behavior is different.
I'm pretty sure, it has nothing to do with this patch itself. You may
want to look in your bootscripts where it hangs, not in the kernel.
