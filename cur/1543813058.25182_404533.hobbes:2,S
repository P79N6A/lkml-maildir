Hmmm... I would hope people looking at this doc would understand that, but
I'll see what I can come up with.

Don't you need to use sacrifice_goat() for controlling the IA64? :-)
Besides, I'm not sure that I need to explain that any CPU is a limited case;
I'm primarily trying to define the basic minimal guarantees you can expect
from using a memory barrier, and what might happen if you don't. It shouldn't
matter which arch you're dealing with, especially if you're writing a driver.
I tried to create arch-specific sections for describing arch-specific implicit
barriers and the extent of the explicit memory barriers on each arch, but the
i386 section was generating lots of exceptions that it looked infeasible to
describe them; besides, you aren't allowed to rely on such features outside of
arch code (I count arch-specific drivers as "arch code" for this).

I've added that to the refs, thanks.

Please elaborate.
