Mike / Mark,
Thank-you very much for your replies.
With regard to Mike, (a) I am using a PIII 800, so I really should be seeing better results than your Celeron.  It seems, therefore, that my setup may be defective in more fundamental ways than I had imagined.  (b) I do appreciate that I may not see any real benefit from Ultra/66 at this stage - I was just keen to experiment and see that the hardware was working.
In reply to Mark : (a) my HDD was certainly sold as UDMA 5 capable, and hdparm reports that it is.  (b) I do not think you meant to suggest that I would solve the problem by deleting the -c and -m switches, but I deleted them anyway and the problem remains. (c) I wish I knew why the hell SuSE would include an obsolete kernel in their relatively new, flagship, v7 "Professional".  So far as I can see, kernel 2.4 is not even an option on their ftp site.  I use this machine for my business and cannot afford a major crash precipitated by a piece of inept kernel-tinkering on my part.
I do have a spare machine (bx board though),and I suppose that the way ahead is to play around installing the current kernel on that until I have the confidence to put it in this box.
One final thought.  When I installed the OS I was offered the option to "use DMA", which I accepted. I see this set at an early stage in the boot-process (long before my boot.local executes).  Is there any way this could be obstructing the subsequent instruction to use UDMA ?
Thanks again,
Geoff
