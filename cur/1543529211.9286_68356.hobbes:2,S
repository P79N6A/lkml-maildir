update:
things look better now.
I did umount on the disk, but PC hanged, had to hard reboot
.
when I rebooted, I did fsck, and I answered yes to zillion
questions.  Now, I only got one file that is in that strange
state. 
one of the questions asked was:
File system contains large files but lacks LARGE_FILES flag
in superblock. fix? <y>
any way, now things look OK. as I said before, the disk
was mounted OK with no errors, but fsck fixed whatever
the problem was.
thanks fsck.
