There used to be a problem with starting out with "make -j8" ... sometimes
offsets.h hadn't been made before another compilation was started that
needed it.  This may have been fixed at some point, but I wired a
"make prepare" into my scripts to avoid it.

I'll try it.  Hunk#2 of the change to Makefile didn't apply with
patch ... I had to apply it by hand.
