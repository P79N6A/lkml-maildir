You have a 1.5 GB file composed of 3 evenly sized parts and a header.
The middle part grows by one byte. Eh, what now?

In other words, scratch this whole idea. Suffer your choice of
inefficiency or user-hostility.

This can not be. If you really think that random user-space software
developers will agree on a way to use directories as documents...
It isn't enough to have a few GUI apps. Users will be confused by
the inconsistent treatment.

When I write code, I want a way to get at the inside.
When I do other things, I don't want to bother with such details.

Command-line users who want to see the parts can use special tools.

I'd say you are afraid of change. When the topic isn't devfs... :-/

What use are the raw components? They won't be in any file format
that you would normally use. They may be headerless raw image data,
binary markup language, binary data structures, etc.
Since you need a special tool to create plain text anyway, you
might as well have that tool use the sub-file extraction API.

This isn't VxWorks. You can't do system calls on the command line,
and I don't see much demand for that feature either.
