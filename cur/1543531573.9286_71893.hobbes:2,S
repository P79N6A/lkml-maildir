This does not distinguish between the segfault because of OOM (which can
be recovered from) and the segfault because of a wild pointer dereference
(which probably can not be recovered from).  Thus the need to switch
signal handlers around- outside of the xmalloc() you can assume that all
segfaults are due to wild pointers (because xmalloc touches all memory
before returning it), within xmalloc() you can assume that all segfaults
are due to OOM.

SIGOOM- while not, IMHO, the correct solution- would certainly be better
than what we have today.  Remember that the default behavior of SIGSEGV is
to dump core (see signal(7))!  It'd also automatically differentiate the
wild pointer error and the OOM condition.
