It is hard to call.  The most interesting case I know of is the VIA kt133
AMD bug.  I believe it is register 0x55 bit 7 that when set causes an
athlon optimized memcpy to crash the machine, but when clear it works.
PIII optimized kernels worked fine.

I don't expect a run of memtest86 to produce any problems but it just
feels like bad memory in the case you are describing.
