It looks like the new version has backward links into /usr/include. You
need to do have the new linux source in some sane directory, it should be
called linux-2.2.6.
Now, check to see what the link, /usr/include/asm, is pointing to. It is
probably pointing to /usr/src/linux/include/asm. If so, you should create
a sim-link between your new source-tree and /usr/src/linux.
# file /usr/include/asm
/usr/include/asm: symbolic link to ../src/linux/include/asm
If you put the kernel in 'standard' places, the kernel would be:
	/usr/src/linux-2.2.8
	rm /usr/src/linux     (This should be a sym-link)
	ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.2.8 /usr/src/linux
