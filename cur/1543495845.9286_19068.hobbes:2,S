2.2.7 has been on my notebook since it came out, no problems (though that's
not high-use). 2.2.8-pre5 runs flawlessly on my main machine. 2.2.8 proper
has some major problems - witness the rapid release of 2.2.9. I'm assuming
the latter is OK, but haven't got around to trying it yet (I'm setting up
a CVS tree to cope withe all the different versions and patches I have).
What was the 2.2.7 crash you had?
I've not been around over the last few days and so have been skipping a lot
of l-k. What was the verdict on the 2.2.8 problems? The bdflush / update stuff
was the immediate cause, was it buggy or did it merely reveal an underlying
problem?
