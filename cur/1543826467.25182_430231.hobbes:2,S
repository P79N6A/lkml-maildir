by the way, just to let you know ...
my attempt to create files via wrudf from the udftools
failed, too.
when operating on a diskimage, wrudf will exit with
"readPacket: read failed: bad address"
a closer look reveals that wrudf tries to read() into
a buffer-address of NIL.
yes, I'm using the latest udftools.
kind regards,
