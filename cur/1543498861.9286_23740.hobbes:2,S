The test is the other way around from what you expect.  Normally
vremap will return NULL for adresses below the top of memory (since it
probably would be a mistake to allow physical RAM to be mapped by a
driver), my patch excludes the memory hole from that test.
        if (MAP_NR(offset) < MAP_NR(high_memory)
            && (offset < memory_hole_start || offset+size > memory_hole_end))
                return NULL;

Well my patch was a hack to get things working, with minimal changes
to the memory management code in the kernel.  It could most probably
be done in a better way.
