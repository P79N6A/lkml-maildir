I'm fairly certain it is safe, but if you want help with the port,
I'm more than willing to work and test along with you. :)  Also note
that we are working on getting IDE disks working at this time.  Now
if we can just get page typing flags used, we can get the entire
ordered dump mechanism going.  Not to mention processor-specific
data structures ...
Lots of things to add, but we believe, along with other crash dump
implementations, that this is the right method for crash dumps.
