No, not at all.  Only the parent and child are involved in the fork 
itself, although we may have to consider the priority of other runnable
tasks when we first come to scheduled the child.

Maybe, but although a lot of the POSIX threads are reasonable, things
like requiring uid/gid updates to be instantly effective across all
threads in the process are just insane.  There ain't no way that's 
going into the kernel any time soon: it would require adding semaphore
locking to all of the credential information that is currently task-
local.
