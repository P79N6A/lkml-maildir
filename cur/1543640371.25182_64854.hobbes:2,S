Subject: [PATCH 2.5.31] i386 subarchitecture division into machine types
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This code rearranges the arch/i386 directory structure to allow for sliding 
additional non-pc hardware in here in an easily separable (and thus easily 
maintainable) fashion.  The idea is that all the code for the particular 
problem hardware should be able to go in a separate directory with only 
additional build options in config.in.
No significant changes since 2.5.26
