Hi Ulrich.

Lemme see, how easy would it be for a non-root user to create that...
 1. Create ordinary binary by compiling as usual. Call it cracker for
    the purposes of this text, and set it up to have the relevant caps
    for some security hack you want to do.
 2. Run the following commands, in the order specified:
	chmod 4755 cracker
	chown 0.0 cracker
I wonder what the result of that would be...

It's a security risk that isn't worth taking, IMHO...
Best wishes from Riley.
