Ok, good, because according to gdb, both password and smb_login_passwd
have the same values.
What the general scheme of events seems to be is: connection gets
dropped, smb_retry gets called by the kernel, and generates the
smb_retry error message, with a -3 code, and smbmount exits.
I don't fully understand the code, and I'm not sure just exactly where
the call to smb_retry comes from; from what I can see, it is internal
to fs/smbfs/proc.c.  If there were some documentation available
detailing what is supposed to happen when a smb connection is dropped
that I could look at?  As in what code gets executed and when? 
Preferably starting from when the kernel/smbmount receives the signal
that the connection is lost.
