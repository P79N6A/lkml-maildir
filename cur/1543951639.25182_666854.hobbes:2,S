Well presumably Vp/Pr => Sp?  Is is true that from the guest's 
perspective, all of the 'p' states are identical to the 'r' states?
Do the host states even really need visibility to the guest at all?  It 
may be useful for the guest to be able to distinguish between Ur and Uz 
but it doesn't seem necessary.
BTW Jeremy, the .dot was very useful!
