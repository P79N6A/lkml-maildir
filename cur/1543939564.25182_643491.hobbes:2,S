Subject: [git pull] scheduler changes for v2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree for v2.6.25 from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
it contains various enhancements to the scheduler - find the full 
shortlog is below. 96 commits from 19 authors - scheduler developers 
have been busy again. :-/
The scheduling behavior of the kernel to normal users should not change 
over v2.6.24, but there are a good number of new features and 
enhancements under the hood:
 - various instrumentation and debugging enhancements from
   Arjan van de Ven. LatencyTOP support in the scheduler is one
   example.
 - Peter Zijlstra's RT time limit and RT throttling code for the RT 
   scheduling class. Both audio and RT folks have asked for this.
 - Paul E. McKenney's preemptible RCU code.
 - refcount based CPU-hotplug rework by Gautham R Shenoy. (The "Lukewarm
   IQ detected in hotplug locking" printout is now gone, forever i hope! :)
 - there's serious interest in running RT tasks on enterprise-class 
   hardware, so Steven Rostedt and Gregory Haskins wrote a large number 
   of enhancements to the RT scheduling class and load-balancer.
 - Peter Zijlstra's high-resolution scheduler tick code. We still have a
   HZ tick running for a few other odd things, but it's dwindling now.
 - Srivatsa Vaddagiri's next version of group scheduling. More accurate,
   more fair.
 - make printk robust against self-recursion, and use stable
   timestamps for printk-timestamps.
 - the softlockup detector will now detect hung, uninterruptible tasks
   automatically, and report them.
and a good number of other, smaller enhancements. Enjoy,
	Ingo
