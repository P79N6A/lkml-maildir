It seems that asynchronous operations are only provided in blkcipher
level not cipher level. So the situation may be as follow:
- Now an AES core block algorithm is implemented with AES-NI as
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER, which can benefit all modes (CBC, LRW, etc). But
because it seems that there is no asynchronous interface for
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER, the AES core block algorithm can not use a
thread to defer real operations.
- To take full advantage of AES-NI pipeline implementation, at least
"cbc(aes)", "ecb(aes)" and "ctr(aes)" should be implemented as
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_ABLKCIPHER. So a thread can be used to defer real
operation upon soft_irq.
Because the combination that kernel process context FPU usage + soft_irq
AES usage is fairly rare, I think the above combination is acceptable.
That is,
- In AES core block algorithm implementation with AES-NI, use x86_64
implementation for the combination above.
- In "cbc(aes)", "ecb(aes)" and "ctr(aes)", use thread deferring for the
combination above.
