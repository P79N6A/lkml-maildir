I remember this, I thought some one responsible for updating current 
version of the main tree.
Now I see the reason this didn't  get into recent stable versions.

I think such code could solve this problem ...

And this one could be fixed with something like this (this is no a 
patch, just an idea)
        change_port = (new_port != ((int) state->port)) ||
                (new_serial.hub6 != state->hub6);
+        change_mem = (new_mem != state->iomem_base)
        if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)) {
-                if (change_irq || change_port ||
+                if (change_irq || change_port || change_mem
As I wrote I didn't check serial.c for all possible problems, I just 
find one bug and suggested
the way it could be solved.
