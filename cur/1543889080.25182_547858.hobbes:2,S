The code doesn't create one device per CRTC. Missing that feature
means that we need a persistent root priv app around that owns the
single device and then listens for messages from each seat asking it
to do things. That root priv app is not necessary, it is a security
risk and it should be eliminated.

All this doesn't mean that it is impossible. I'm not asking you to
write this today, I just want an API that will allow it in the future.
The last graphics API was with us 25 years, I would hope that the
replacement can make it at least six months without needing changes. I
believe this feature will be much easier to implement on DX10 hardware
which will be wide spread in a few years.

Everyone runs X because we have built an environment where it is
pretty much impossible to create an alternative graphics system. If
the low level graphics system is going to get rewritten it is a crime
to do it to only serve the needs of X. Linux is about choice; it's
time we fixed the low level graphics system to make choice possible.
If you haven't noticed the other two major OSes have switched to
graphics systems based on 3D hardware. It is pretty much impossible to
build a graphics system like that for Linux given the current state of
low level graphics support.

And the right way to build a house is to build the kitchen first and
figure out the rest after the kitchen is finished.

A new memory manager for drm is a nice piece of work. It was something
that needed to get done. But right now it is being done in an X
specific manner without consideration of alternative graphics
environments.
