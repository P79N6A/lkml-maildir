Thanks for putting that together; but I didn't find any clues.

It's pretty sure to be userspace related i.e. kernel bug triggered by
particular userspace usage; and understandably, the bits you put there
don't tell me much about what userspace has been up to.  (And don't
worry, I'm not expecting you to tell me more!  I can't think of
anything useful to ask about it - it's not a question of what mix
of apps you have running there, it's a matter of what system calls,
especially mmaps, they make - I'm not expecting traces of that.)

Absolutely.  You mentioned it because it's useful for us to know there's
such an issue about, to keep our eyes open: thank you for doing so.
No need for you to go any further out of your way on it.

Right, I was forgetting that the various "HugePage" lines of /proc/meminfo
don't even appear when those are configured off, so my question was more
obscure than I'd intended.  You're not using HugePages at all, so we
can rule out that line of inquiry - that's helpful, thanks.
I'll keep my eyes open.
