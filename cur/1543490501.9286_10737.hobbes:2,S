That's currently true, but the same line of reasoning can be used to
argue against pretty much any additional capability.  This mod, if
adopted in the main Linux kernel, would make scripts more portable
between different Linux installations, and is simple enough that would
likely be quickly adopted elsewhere.
OTOH, if you were to argue against this on security grounds, you might
have a convincing argument.

Odd that this would be needed.  Isn't \r treated as just another type
of whitespace?
