Not that surprising. The very same factor of 5 was talked about in the
read-ahed thread - "diff -ur" is nasty because the kernel usually cannot
effectively read-ahead much of anything (each file is small, and the
kernel doesn't do intra-file read-ahead), and because the trees are in
different locations on the disk you end up seeking a _lot_ between each
file diff.

Could you maybe instead of pre-reading the whole tree, just pre-read one
directory at a time?
Quite frankly, the whole-tree approach only works well if you have _much_
more than 2*tree-size worth of memory (not counting other apps you have
open).  Not everybody has that, especially not these days when the full
tree is 50MB+ or something.
So the full pre-read is probably only worthwhile on machines with closer
to half a gig of memory, or with old kernels..
Even just doing it one directory at a time should improve speed
_noticeably_. I'd bet you'll get close to the same improvement, with much
less memory pressure..
