Hi Linus,
   I've visiting at my parents house and gave 2.6.15-rc7 a try on my
dad's machine. This machine is his normal desktop box which I
administer remotely, as well as a MythTV server. The new kernel built
and booted fine. I then built the NVidia stuff. However when I tried
to build the ivtv driver from portage it failed:
 * Determining the location of the kernel source code
 * Found kernel source directory:
 *     /usr/src/linux
 * Found sources for kernel version:
 *     2.6.15-rc7
 * Checking for suitable kernel configuration options:
>>> Unpacking source...
>>> Unpacking ivtv-0.4.0.tar.gz to /var/tmp/portage/ivtv-0.4.0-r2/work
>>> Unpacking pvr_2.0.24.23035.zip to /var/tmp/portage/ivtv-0.4.0-r2/work
>>> Source unpacked.
 * Preparing ivtv module
created ivtv-svnversion.h

   Most probably this is stuff the Gentoo devs will clean up when the
real kernel comes out but I *think* you were asking for this sort of
info so I'm posting it back.
Cheers to all,
Mark
