2.6.0-test11 deadlocked after less than a hour here.

Well, IDE is what i'd blame. My original experience about lost
interrupts leads me to ide. Since i never loose interrupts without
io-apic.
Also, i tried to get it running with the ide cable that came with the
board but that caused my 60 gig Quantum and my 80 gig Seagate disks to
show up as 8mb disks with garbled names so i skipped that =)
(2.6 also mentions something about cable info bits not set properly)
I use USB 2.0 and 1.1. I have also disabled audio and lan.
A7N8X-X Bios 1007 (Nforce2-400).

Well, IO-APIC without the amd/nvidia driver works, although a lost
interrupt stalls the machine for a annoying-ammount-of-time.

Yeah, anyone that has checked the changes?
