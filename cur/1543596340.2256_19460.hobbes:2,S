But that's exactly what we want.  Note that the idea of reserving a fixed 
amount of memory for "one-shot" pages wasn't mine.  I see no reason to set a 
limit.  There's only one critereon: does a page get referenced between the 
time it's created and when its probation period expires?
Once a page makes it into the active (level 2) set it's on an equal footing 
with lots of others and it's up to our intrepid one-hand clock to warm it up 
or cool it down as appropriate.  On the other hand, if the page gets sent to 
death row it still has a few chances to prove its worth before being cleaned 
up and sent to the aba^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H reclaimed.  (Apologies for the 
multiplying metaphors ;-)
