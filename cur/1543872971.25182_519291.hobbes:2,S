I'll try to explain the reason for the deadlock first.

This is what happens:
write fault on upper filesystem
  balance_dirty_pages
    submit write requests
  loop ...
------- fuse IPC ---------------
[fuse loopback fs thread 1]
read request
sys_write
  mutex_lock(i_mutex)
  ...
     balance_dirty_pages
        submit write requests
        loop ... write requests completed ... dirty still over limit ... 
	... loop forever
[fuse loopback fs thread 1]
read request
sys_write
  mute_lock(i_mutex) blocks
So the queue for the upper filesystem is full.  The queue for the
lower filesystem is empty.  There are no dirty pages in the lower
filesystem.
So kicking pdflush for the lower filesystem doesn't help, there's
nothing to do.  balance_dirty_pages() for the lower filesystem should
just realize that there's nothing to do and return, and then there
would be progress.
So there's there's really no need to do any accounting, just some
logic to determine that a backing dev is nearly or completely
quiescent.
And getting out of this tight situation doesn't have to be efficient.
This is probably a very rare corner case, that almost never happens in
real life, only with aggressive test tools like bash_shared_mapping.

Yeah, we'd loose a bit of CPU, but not any write performance, since it
is being throttled back anyway.

Hmm, not quite what I need.

Yes, this is an option, but I hope for a simpler solution.
Thanks,
