Thanks for the report!
It sounds like this might be the same problem as
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6292
In short, you probably have a bridge device that consumes the
entire 0x0-0xffff I/O port range and produces some or all of that
range for downstream PNP devices.  PNP doesn't know what to do
with these windows that are both consumed by the bridge and made
available to downstream devices, so it just marks them as being
already reserved.
Matthieu Castet wrote a nice patch (attached) that makes PNP just
ignore those windows.  Can you try it and see whether it fixes
the problem you're seeing?  This patch is already in -mm, but not
yet in mainline.  We might need to consider this patch as
2.6.18 material if it resolves your problem.  I suspect many
people will see the same problem.
If it doesn't fix the problem, could I trouble you to open a
report at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 and assign it to me?  If
you could attach the dmesg log and the output of "for i in
/sys/bus/pnp/devices/*; do echo $i; cat $i/id; cat $i/resources;
cat $i/options; done", that would be useful.
Thanks,
