Surely there is a sysfs path we can devise to do
	echo "add <pci_device_id line>" > /sys/pci/driver/tulip
(or replace that with a file-oriented interface that inputs an entire
table)
and internally just refer to, and update, a kmalloc'd copy of the
original driver's pci (or usb) table.

Yes.  tulip driver could find this useful, but that's currently a small
case worked around in the driver.
The big and annoying case is 8139C+ (8139cp.c), which has the same
PCI id as old 8139 boards, but additionally includes dramatically new
and better functionality.  The distinguishing characteristic at the
probe phase is the PCI revision id, as the PCI id is the same as another
driver.
