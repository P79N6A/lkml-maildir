exactly, while that would be simple to implement and very lightweight at
runtime, that's not enough to mathematically drop the complexity of the
get_unmapped_area algorithm. It would optimize only the case where
there's no fragmentation of the mapped virtual address space.
For finding the best fit in the heap with O(log(N)) complexity (rather
than the current O(N) complexity of the linked list) one tree indexed by
the size of each hole would be necessary.
