Hello,
I got this in my logs:
 ip_conntrack: maximum limit of 16368 entries exceeded
what does this mean, I know i can change the limits in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max, but I want to know what this is for.
P.S. I looked into linux/Documentation but did not find any mention of
this configrable parameter....
