Yes, that would work. copy_to_user is never called with the mmap 
semaphore locked, i.e.
#define copy_to_user(...) \
        down(&current->mm->mmap_sem); \
        check_wp_bit(); \
        real_copy_to_user(); \
        up(&current->mm->mmap_sem)
verify_area would just check that the pointer is below TASK_SIZE, and 
the wp bit is checked within copy_to_user().
But how many 80386 Linux systems that run the 2.4 kernel exist?
