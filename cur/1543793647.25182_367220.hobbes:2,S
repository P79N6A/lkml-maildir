This will only work on IA32...but..
I usually use "Time Slice Counter" which is 64bit register counting
up the CPU Freq for this purpose. Since it's built into CPU, no OS
call overhead happens. Also, because now-a-day CPU runs in very high
speed, each count will give you upto 0.3nsec accuracy.
Speed step technology might slow the CPU Freq, so it's true that
things aren't as accurate as it used to be. But this is the best I
can find.
I though similar counter is available for PowerPC too.
# At least, PPC601 had something similar.

There is overhead.
If you mmap(), address is reserved, but shall not have memory
assigned yet. When you read the address, exception will occur, and
then memory will be attached. THIS action is overhead.
Also, once it's attached, there's no way for OS to know when that
mapped page can be freed, to fill in newer value.
I don't think mmap() idea will work as good as it seems.
I might be making mistake, though.
