Quite frankly I think it's too messy.
I'd like FUSE a whole lot more if it _only_ did the general page cache 
reading, but it seems to do a whole lot more, most of it broken.
In other words, I think it's fundamentally wrong to not have a special
"fuse_file_read". If it isn't just "generic_file_read()" (possibly
together with a re-validation callback but even that is very debatable 
indeed) there's something wrong with it imho.
The code looks like it was started before the page cache was all done, and 
nobody ever cleaned it up to use the full VFS power - or for some suspect 
reason decided that they wanted to support insane filesystems.
Together with removing the 2.4.x code and sending a real patch that has 
the cleanups, and maybe I'd reconsider.
