I have no idea why that would be.  Maybe you can find out.  :)

It doesn't exactly say *why* or compare to other arm926ejs
chips ... 
Could the 64-bit math (ktime stuff) be a factor there?  Your
board probably only runs at 95 (or-so) bogomips after all.
And is that just a NO_HZ issue, or generically an issue when
oneshot timer modes are in heavy use?
