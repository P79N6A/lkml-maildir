	The point is that protecting against damage done by root is foolish.
Attempting to protect the hardware from root is silly.  If this patch has
other redeeming features, such as adding a proper return code for invalid
requests, then perhaps it should be applied.  It shouldn't be put in if the
only point to it is to try and protect against root doing damage.
	A question for you though: I get the impression these operations
that can destroy the disk were originally designed by the vendors as ways
to update the bios on the disk from software.  Clearly this can be a useful
feature, much the same as updating the bios on a motherboard from software.
Would your patch break this ability, requireing people to reboot to DOS or
similar in order to upgrade the bios on their disks?
