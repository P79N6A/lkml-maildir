For small/medium ext2 directories and cold caches, the fastest way to
stat all the entries is to sort by inode number, d_ino.  This orders the
disk I/O optimally, and the saving from that is greater than the loss
due to directory search time.
I haven't tested this on very large directories -- but I'd expect the
quadratic directory search time to be more significant than I/O time
for ext2, fat etc.
The cyclic search suggestion
  - wouldn't help for randomly ordered directories,
    but wouldn't make things any worse either
    (on ext2, this tends to be directories containing other directories)
  - would help a lot for directories whose entries are mostly in inode order
    (on ext2, this tends to be most directories containing files)
