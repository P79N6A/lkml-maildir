How to autodetect that the user is going to buy gadget xyz next week?
(OK, he can re-run autodetection then, although that's not a
particularly economic strategy.)
How to autodetect POSIX_MQUEUE, HZ_250, HOTPLUG_PCI, ...?

I don't miss the point.  I just say what we realistically can do.  And I
might add, we should try hard to achieve good results in each of the
points I listed.

No, I don't.
(I have "worked" long enough in enduser support, and still am doing
support, to not have completely lost an eye for enduser needs.  Or so I
believe.)
