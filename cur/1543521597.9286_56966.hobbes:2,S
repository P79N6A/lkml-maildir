	Set 1 to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag before the first masq
connection (at net set up) and don't change it anymore or use:
echo 1000000000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag
	You even don't need to help masquerade by changing this value.
	The negative values are possible only when you set the value to 1.
