Have you confirmed that you see correct values for all the registers? I had 
found some problems with gdb not being able to locate all the registers 
correctly. Explanation on the problem below:
Besides getting gdb's fault there  is one more benefit of kern_schedule. All 
threads are shown by gdb as sleeping _at_ the place where schedule call is 
present: So instead of gdb showing all threads sleeping in __switch_to, it 
shows several functions. That's better than having to look at back trace of 
each thread to figure out what it is.
This functionality is complemented by printing of thread names in 2.0.X kgdb 
info threads listing. 
Now back to gdb problem of not being able to locate registers.
schedule results in code of this form:
schedule:
framesetup
registers save
...
...
save registers
change esp
call switchto
restore registers
...
...
GDB can't analyze code other than frame setup and registers save. It may not 
show values of variables that are present in registers correctly. This used 
to be a problem some time ago (gdb 5.X). Perhaps gdb 6.x does a better job.
hmm...
May be its time I should look at gdb's x86 register info code again.
