Not sure, but I'd be pretty nervous about breaking any existing users
which aren't explicitly syncing.
Are you envisioning users who want to see where their data is landing
for performance reasons?  It seems like such users are going to have
sufficiently different desires from existing FIBMAP users (who need to
know where everything is because they intend to fiddle with the raw
device) that a different interface might be warranted.
