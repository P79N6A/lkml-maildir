This is great.  While I am sure all three of this points wouldn't be
true without preempt patch, I would be interested in seeing your opinion
of the comparison between with and without, if you had the time.  Also
comparing the dbench would be nice, but you must be careful to replicate
the system similarly.
Thanks much for the feedback,
