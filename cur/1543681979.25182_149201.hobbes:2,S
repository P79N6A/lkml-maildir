Subject: [PATCH] Fix ALi15x3 DMA on sparc64 (maybe others)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/17/198

Attached is a patch that is known to fix atleast the DMA corruption
occuring on sparc64 in 2.4.x kernels for ALi15x3 IDE chipsets. I think
Alan hinted that someone also reported it fixed a similar problem on
alpha.
I've been using this patch for some time now, with great results, and
Debian unstable sparc64 users have unknowingly been testing the patch
aswell. No reports of problems.
Please apply for 2.4.22. Original patch was from Ivan Kokshaysky.
