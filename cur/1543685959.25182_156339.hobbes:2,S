OK, looks like there is a tricky interplay between algorithms and
transforms.  Cipher implementors will need documentation here, e.g.
"cia_encrypt and cia_decrypt are always called with src==dst UNLESS
we are running in CBC mode AND cia_ivsize!=0" (Please confirm...)
Anybody who tries to bypass the scatterlist-based api by exporting
and calling crypto_alg_lookup() (as I did) will get bitten badly.
