Hi,
I'm running 2.2.0-final, compiled and installed it today.
I'm using Netscape 4.5 libc5 and haven't noticed any unusual problems
from 2.0.36 jumping to 2.1.131 and up to 2.2.0-final. (I have to close and
reopen it after couple of days, as it grows unnecessary big in memory and
gets slower and slower)
May-be this is not netscape nor kernel problem, you just have to upgrade
or recompile some package? (I had to recompile pcmcia-cs-3.0.7, had nice
oops otherwise:-) Are you using old (or unstable snapshots from) (g)libc
for excample?
Best regards,
Andrus Kangro
