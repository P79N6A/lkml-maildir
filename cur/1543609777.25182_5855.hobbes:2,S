Drivers are distributed pretty much the same way as nVidia, ie., as a binary 
core along with the necessary wrappers to compile for new kernels, private 
libGL.so, etc.  Aside from that, we've generally had pretty positive 
experiences.
These aren't quake cards; in fact the demo1 fps are  surprisingly low. In 
serious OpenGL benchmarks, however,  
(

 ) they're currently the 
fastest cards available for Linux by a long shot.
I think FGL is what people at ILM, Dreamworks, Digital Domain etc. are using 
at the moment in the gradual shift toward Linux on the artist's desktop. Not 
cheap --- unless you've already forked over $16K for Maya ;-)
