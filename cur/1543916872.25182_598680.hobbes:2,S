These sysctls control whether bridged packets will be handled
by iptables and friends. The bridge netfilter code always
handles bridged packets, and iptables might be loaded for
different reasons. So I don't see how that would work.
I think it should be specified in the ebtables ruleset, but
the current netfilter infrastructure doesn't allow to do that
cleanly.
