Subject: Yet another 845G IDE problem

I can't get DMA to work on an AOpen motherboard using the Intel 845G
chipset. I see in the archives that other people have had problems like
this, and that it's due to a BIOS problem. I've tried some of the
patches that were sent in response, but it seems that those patches are
already incorporated into the kernel I'm using (2.4.20-pre1-ac3) and I
still have the problem.
My kernel command line includes "ide0=dma".
These lines show up on boot:
PCI: Using IRQ router PIIX [8086/24c0] at 00:1f.0
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:1f.1
...[several unrelated lines]...
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
ICH4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev f9
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions

And here's what seems to be the relevant part of 'lspci -v':
