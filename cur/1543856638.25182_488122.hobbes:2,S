Hi Mel,
I think you're right about the leakage, thanks for catching it.
As far as allocating pages twice is concerned, I *strongly* believe
it is the wrong tradeoff to fix this with a "cached_page" because we
have to hit 2 reasonably rare races.
Firstly, we must find no pagecache exists, then we discover a page
has been installed after allocating. This will be rare for most
workloads, but lets say that it comes up in a few because page alloc
may sleep (a busy file server might have several processes reading
the same file, triggering this race in the write path would be even
less common).
However supposing this race is triggered, then we *also* need to
fail the page lookup a few instructions after a similar operation
has succeeded!
Thanks, will post an updated and properly tested version in a while.
