Venki (at least I think it was him) also told me about cpuidle and the
menu governor on #powertop. Unfortunately, cpuidle seems to be gone from
acpi-test (or I'm simply still too stupid for git/gitweb). I manually
added the cpuidle and menu governor patches on top of my 2.6.22-rc1-hrt8
kernel, but that broke C-state duration accounting.
On the bright side of things is power usage though, which is down to an
incredible 13.9W in idle+ipw2200 :)
Thanks,
Björn
