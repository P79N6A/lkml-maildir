Duh. I am trying to prove that fast fsck is good for everyone, not
that it's the right way to get high availability.

Not necessarily. There are many ways to approach high availability.

You'd be surprised how many people use them that way. However, even
with completely separate hardware in completely separate cities, you
will probably find that you will be happier if fsck is fast.

You haven't listened to what I said, I suspect.
And many other people with less need for high availability still have
need for fast fsck.
Please, let's stop this pointless "discussion". You (and several
others) are arguing against a strawman. Fast fsck is good. Everyone
benefits from it.
