The old epst driver (the one on the web page) works with 2.0 kernels
(but may require some fiddling).  It is definitely a "use at your own
risk" option.
An entirely new driver for 2.2 is being tested now ...
I'd be interested in hearing from one or two people who have the HP5100
(PP) scanner and are familiar with building kernels, understand how
Linux SCSI works and are not uncomfortable with the risks associated with
debugging device drivers ...
