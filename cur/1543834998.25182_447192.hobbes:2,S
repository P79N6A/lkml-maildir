I don't think the force set should be able to override the cap bound
though. Like the force/setuid analogy, I think we can compare the
cap_bset to the old securelevel system, which means that it should be
the bounding factor. Even if you have setuids on a system with a
raised securelevel, they still can't do the restricted operations.
Once again, this is not based on what the POSIX 1003.1e says, as a
matter of fact I can't find anything about lowering the systemwide
bound externally (as opposed to by not having forced-set executables
and dropping the caps from all processes) at all in a quick grep of
the document, so I suspect this is entirely outside of the spec anyway.
