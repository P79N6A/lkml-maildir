Well, no, it doesn't. That's a problem. Jeff Garzik's ethtool 
extension at least tells me the PCI bus/dev/fcn, though, and from 
that I can write a userland mapping function to the physical 
location. My point, though, is that finding the socket is a real-life 
problem on systems with multiple interfaces. I don't expect the 
kernel to know the physical locations, but the user has to be able to 
get from kernel/ifconfig names (eth#) to sockets, one way or another. 
Support for a uniform means of doing the mapping, even if it needs 
userland help, would be good.

They're not necessarily unique, though.

This pushes the problem back in time: I need to write the UUID, for 
example, at some point. And, with hot-swappable drives, I'm still 
interested in the physical location. I really know know that there's 
a good answer to this problem, especially with FC, but I need to tell 
an operator, "replace this particular physical drive". It doesn't do 
any good to tell the operator the UUID.

What good does it do to tell an operator to connect a cable to a MAC 
address? Or to remove a drive having a particular UUID? If it's "mere 
information", it's *necessary* mere information.

But (ideally) should.
