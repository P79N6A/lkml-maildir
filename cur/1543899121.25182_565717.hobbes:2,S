Well, is there any driver in the tree that works like that _and_ has a
.suspend() method requiring the same lock?
Besides, I'm not going to put the task into the refrigerator at that point.
Please read 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/6/71
Moreover, I claim that, in the context of your example, _if_ the task is stuck
at the wait_event_uninterruptible(), _then_ the freezerless suspend will
deadlock with the task.
