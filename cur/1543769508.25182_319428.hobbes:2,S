Would you please explain 'auxiliary' vector???
According to the documentation, the following information
is passed to a program:
#
#   %edx        Contains a function pointer to be registered with `atexit'.
#               This is how the dynamic linker arranges to have DT_FINI
#               functions called for shared libraries that have been loaded
#               before this code runs.
#
#   %esp        The stack contains the arguments and environment:
#               (%esp)                  argc
#               4(%esp)                 argv[0]
#               ...
#               (4*argc)(%esp)          NULL
#               (4*(argc+1))(%esp)      envp[0]
#               ...
#                                       NULL
#
Now, where is that 'auxiliary vevtor'??? I got a pointer to
something to be executed before calling exit, I have an
argument count, then a bunch of pointers (argv), terminating
with a NULL, then another bunch of pointers (envp) terminating
with a NULL.  Is there something after that??? If so, what's
the contents of this thing?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
