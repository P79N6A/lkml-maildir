When looking further down the statistics mail one finds
this table:

It implies that the statistics were for April 19 to April 25
rather than April 19 to April 20... However, that table too
seems a bit odd, as I am used to getting about the same number
of mails per day, any day of the week (and there are definitely
no days when I get as few as 6 or 16 mails from this list)....
