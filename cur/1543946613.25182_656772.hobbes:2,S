Hello all,
A bit of update to this issue.
Switching the cabling of the most problematic drive with a new one  
didn't fix the issue.
I couldn't yet switch the power supply with a more powerful one.  
However I temporarily added a pci-e SATA host and another drive, the  
situation was just as bad, not worse ;-) This HBA just had 2 ports,  
so I couldn't swap it completely with the nvidia ports.
Just as a guess I added sata_nv.adma=0 and the problem completly  
disappeared for 4 weeks now. Removing it from cmdline just make it  
come back.
Unfortunately I'm running xen on this host so I don't think adma  
patches if any may be suitable to me, at least as long as something >  
2.6.20 doesn't come in gentoo for xen...
Regards,
GoM
