The use of pid_ts in debug statements could be confusing, but generally,
the debug output will only be used when the person gathering it is aware
of the environment it is collected in. We can change these as needed as
time passes.
We also send the pid_t via autofs request packets and it is used for
user space debug prints. It is open to the same confusion and I'm still
not sure how to deal with that but it isn't important to sort that out
now either, for the same reason as above.
