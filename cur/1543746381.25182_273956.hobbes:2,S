Mmm. But I don't want to try to patch swsusp into suspend2. I just want
to merge - there are too many big differences between swsusp and
suspend2 for that (it's been redesigned from the ground up).
I'm thinking that rather than trying to get everything nice and tidy and
perfect before I submit it, I should just put it up for review now,
acknowledging that I still need to do more work on the docs and so on,
and see how I go. Sound feasible?
Regards,
Nigel
