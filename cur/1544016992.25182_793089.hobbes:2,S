  Uh. Here I don't get it. When we did sync_inode(), blkdev_issue_flush()
is needed only if the journal does not do barriers. So I'd expect here:
	if (!(journal->j_flags & JBD2_BARRIER))
		goto flush_blkdev;
	goto out;

  But here we might need to issue a flush if there are some data written. So
I'd have here:
	if (!(i_state & I_DIRTY_PAGES))
		goto out;
