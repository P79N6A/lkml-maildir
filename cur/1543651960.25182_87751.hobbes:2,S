Even if this is true - I'll grant you that it may be - let the vendor
package /usr/bin/qconf as a shell script that links /usr/lib/qconf.o
with -lqt and $(LINUX)/scripts/kconfig/libkconfig.a .  It's a little
unorthodox, but it removes the hackery of figuring out how HOSTCC is
supposed to build a shared library and whether any magic is needed at
runtime.  Removes the need for the horrible stuff libtool was invented
for, in other words.
Remember, the whole point of HOSTCC is to support a build environment
different from the compile target - arbitrarily different, even.
