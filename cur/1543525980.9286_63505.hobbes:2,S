I take it back - 2.2.14aa6 is _not_  OK. Tonight, when I run an I/O intensive
(not VM intensive!) job, the load increased to 6 and I found the following in kern.log:
Feb 15 22:15:13 badija kernel: VM: killing process xlock
Feb 15 22:15:16 badija kernel: VM: killing process tcsh
Feb 15 22:15:26 badija kernel: VM: killing process rpc.mountd
Feb 15 22:15:31 badija kernel: VM: terminating process XF86_SVGA
Feb 15 22:15:31 badija kernel: VM: killing process xload
