One small nit to pick here.  As is pointed out in the support db the
-Uvh parameter works for kernel-header-foo and kernel-source-foo, but
you want -ivh for the kernel-foo package.  Doing an upgrade of a running
kernel instead of an install can get you into nasty situations that can
be hard to get out of.
