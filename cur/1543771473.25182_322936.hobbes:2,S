Good point. I was just trying to include the just arrived cpu, in the 
set, but i can convince myself that this would be any real value to include
this newly arrived cpu in that case. I can drop it.

panic() ends up calling smp_send_stop(), i dont think we could hold a sema
in that path if we end up calling from intr context.
probably from callers of stop_machine/restart we could add lock_cpu_hotplug
not too sure how useful that would be though.
