	Good question... yes and no... v4l subsystem is under my concern, but I
never touched this driver. Also, it doesn't use videodev.c. Maybe we
should address this question to v4l mailing list (I'm c/c).
	Your comments seems to be pertinent, IMHO. Btw, we have also a similar
patch for em28xx driver at our quilt tree:
	
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/quilt
	under:
patches/v4l_dvb_3113_convert_em28xx_to_use_vm_insert_page_instead_of_remap_pfn_range.patch
	Would you please review it also? I've tested it and it seems to work
properly.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
