So... instead of one big freezer (we know it is problematic), you have
100 small freezers, problematic in same way :-(.
Let's take current FUSE problems, and see if they have problem on PPC,
ok?
Let's say FUSE thread touches one of those "blocking" devices. It is
now in D state, somewhere in kernel.... exactly same way refrigerator
works.
Now, if kernel needs FUSE services for some reason (that's the problem
we hit in s2ram case, right?), we have a deadlock.
So main problem still seems to be "kernel should not depend on
userland services during suspend", refrigerator or not.
