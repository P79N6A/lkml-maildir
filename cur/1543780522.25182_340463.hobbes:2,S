I don't think there's a central documentation maintainer as such.
I recently submitted a brand new document myself and added Andrew
Morton to CC since he's the overall 2.6 maintainer, and Andrew has
been kind enough to add my document to the -mm tree for starters.
Hopefully it'll then migrate onto mainline eventually.
