Subject: $CHECK can't be overridden

make help implies that supplying $CHECK on the command line
should override sparse as the checker used when building with C=1
Yet, this doesn't seem to be the case.
This would be useful for cases where for eg, sparse isn't in
the $PATH, allowing an explicit path to the executable to be
passed in automated build environments.
