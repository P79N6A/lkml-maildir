Its not really XFS, its more the generic device freezing code
(freeze_bdev) which is called by both XFS and the device mapper
suspend interface (both of which are exposed to userspace via
ioctls).  These interfaces are used when doing block level
snapshots which are "filesystem coherent".

This particular case was a device mapper stack trace, hence the
confusion, I think.  Both XFS and DM are making the same generic
block layer call here though (freeze_bdev).

Indeed, its a fairly ordinary interface, but thats too late to go
fix now I guess (since its exposed to userspace already).  A remount
flag along the lines of readonly may have been a better way to go...
perhaps.  *shrug*... not clear - I guess the problem the original
authors had there (whoever they were, I dunno), was that the block
layer wants to call up to the filesystem to quiesce itself, and at
some later user-defined point to unquiesce itself... which is a bit
of a layering violation.
>From a quick look, there seems to be a bug in the original patch - it
is passing -EAGAIN back without wrapping it up in ERR_PTR(), which
it needs to since freeze_bdev returns a struct super_block pointer.
cheers.
