One great test that I'm using regularly to see what's goin' on, is at
http://lxr.linux.no/.
 It is a cool utility to cross reference your
Linux kernel source tree, and in the mean time eat gobs of memory, do
lots of I/O, and burn many CPU cycles (all at the same time). Ideal
test, if you ask me and if anybody has the time, it would be nice to
see different timing numbers when run on different kernels. Just make
sure you run it on the same kernel tree to make reproducable results.
It has three passes, and the third one is the most interesting one
(use vmstat 1 to see why). When run with 64MB RAM configuration, it
would swap heavily, with 128MB somewhat, and at 192MB maybe not
(depending on the other applications running at the same time).
Try it, it is a nice utility, and a great test. :)
