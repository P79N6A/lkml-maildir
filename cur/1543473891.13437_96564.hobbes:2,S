It should be reasonably simple to teach fsck to link all files with problems
to /lost+found (but make /lost+found mode 600 before you do that...).

I have a 4-GB file system that gets completely fsck'ed in a minute or so.
The fact that it holds exactly two files (both of them 2 GBytes big...)
should be telling, of course -- fsck speed is more a function of the number
of inodes in use than of the number of blocks.
