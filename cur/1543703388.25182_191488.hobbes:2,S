So I'm the only one with deja vu ?
My recollection of history went something like..
2.2 - Marked as OBSOLETE when /proc/bus/pci came to town.
      iirc, even Martin Mares (PCI maintainer at the time) wanted
	  it removed in 2.3.x
2.3 - Linus decides he likes it, and wants to keep it.
2.4 - Unmarked OBSOLETE
2.5 - Silence, (though we now get PCI stuff in /sys too, woo!)
2.6 - "It will be removed in 2.7"
Anyone else spot a pattern ?  8-)
