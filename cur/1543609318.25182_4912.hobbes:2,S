This is to announce release of Linux-NTFS user space support tools 1.4.0.
Most important changes:
mkntfs now support creation of NTFS floppies and the root directory on 
volumes with cluster sizes > 4kiB are now created correctly.
ntfsfix now supports Windows XP (NTFS 3.1) volumes.
Linux-NTFS packages (your choice of source tar.gz or rpm, binary i386.rpm 
and devel rpm) can be downloaded from the Linux-NTFS home page at:
         
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/
Or if you prefer CVS access, look at the project home page on Sourceforge 
for details how to access the CVS server:

ChangeLog:
1.4.0: Major fix in mkntfs, small update to ntfsfix, and other updates.
- Update ntfsfix to support Windows XP NTFS volumes (NTFS 3.1).
- Update layout.h with more information.
- (Re)enable shared libraries.
- Changes to mkntfs:
         - Correct handling of directories on volumes with cluster sizes 
above 4096 bytes.
         - Lower minimum size of NTFS partitions to 1MiB, scaling down the 
logfile size as necessary.
         - Support a wider range of input parameters. Now should have all 
valid combinations covered.
         - Update man page.
         - Implement better determination of device size.
         - Various bug fixes.
1.2.2: Small fix in mkntfs and minor updates.
- Small fix in mkntfs for small volumes with non-standard sector sizes, 
where the default values would result in a sector size smaller than the 
sector size and mkntfs would refuse to run because of this. The man page 
was updated accordingly.
- Minor updates/clarifications to include/layout.h.
1.2.1: Added ntfsfix man page and minor cleanup.
- David Martínez Moreno <david.martinez@rediris.es> donated a man page for 
ntfsfix as well as spelling mistake fixes all over the place.
1.2.0: Important bug fixes to mkntfs.
- Bug fixes for cluster sizes > 4kb involving corrections to mft mirror 
size and contents, mft data attribute position and mft bitmap 
size.     Some of those were nasty so this is a major improvement.
For older changes, see the ChangeLog file in the release or in CVS.
Best regards,
         Anton
