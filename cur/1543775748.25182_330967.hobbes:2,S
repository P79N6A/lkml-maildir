Hi all,
Here is our (see copyright section ;)) simple script that help to create 
a bug report:
http://stud.wsi.edu.pl/~piotrowskim/files/ort/beta/ort-b5.tar.bz2
Why do we do this?
Because many people don't have time to prepare a good (with all 
importrant pieces of information) bug report.
How does it work?
It creates file with information about your system (software, hardware, 
used modules etc.), add file with oops into it and in the future sends 
it to the chosen mainterner or lkml.
How can you help?
If you know something about bash scripting you can review it, add some 
useful features and make some optimalisations. Or just send me an idea.
Changelog:
now you may do:
- short report (first 5 points)
- long report (old verbose style)
- custom report (you can choose what do you want to send)
- from template (ie. with USB informations)
- new logo (Maciej Soltysiak)
Todo:
- more e-mail clients
- more templates
Regards,
Michał Piotrowski
