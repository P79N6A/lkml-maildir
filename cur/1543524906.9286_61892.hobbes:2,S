   Sorry but thats *BAD* performance by the SK card. I do around 2.5K
   ints/sec with the Alteon when doing 65MB/sec traffic in one direction
   with regular sized frames.
If he's getting such bad performance, why is his bandwidth
nearly 40MB/sec more than yours :-)  So the interrupt mitigation
could be tuned a bit more in the SK driver, big deal.
I personally am very impressed with the SK cards from my
testing here... whereas I'm not so impressed with the
acenic chipset.
