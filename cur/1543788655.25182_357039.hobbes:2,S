Hi Ingo,

Yes setting up the page table entries is the job of the kernel , but
for that we need to put the physical add. of the page and some bits
(present,access writes etc) in the entry, once it is done the main job
of translation which requires the masking and shifting is done by the
processor whenever that page is referenced .
so why these macros are present in the kernel?
