I already replied to Marius in private, but as he asked here too, I
think I should answer here as well if others are interested in the
solution.
The feature Marius is asking for does exist in 2.6.13 already, in the
form of the fix_pwm_polarity parameter to the it87 driver. Setting this
to 1 did work for Marius.
More generally, if you have an IT8705F or IT8712F chip and loading the
it87 driver complains about suspicious PWM polarity, here are the things
to try in order:
1* Look for a BIOS upgrade, which might fix it.
2* Try modprobe it87 fix_pwm_polarity=1 and physically ensure that the
fans still spin.
3* Experiment with manual PWM. Higher PWM values (up to 254) should make
the fan spin faster, lower PWM values should make it slower.
4* - If PWM works now, you should complain to your motherboard
manufacturer and ask them for a fixed BIOS.
- If PWM still doesn't work, this means that the motherboard was simply
not wired for PWM operations, which explains why the BIOS did not take
care of properly initializing the PWM polarity.
Hope that helps,
