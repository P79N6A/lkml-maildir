It's still policy, and should be put someplace where users can manage it.
You're changing the behavior from what POSIX specifies, and that's in general
a no-no for mainline kernel code.
Like an LSM, which happens to be there so users can impose policy without
making any code changes to the kernel.  Implementing a policy that results in
non-POSIXy behavior in an LSM is perfectly OK.. ;)

Right.. Which means LSM can stop that particular attack even faster than
your patch.. ;)

You're making the very rash assumption that a hard-coded one-size-fits all
"default" that behaves differently than POSIX is suitable for all sites,
including sites that run software that gets broken by this change, and
things like embedded systems where it's not a concern at all, and sites that
already implement some *other* system to ensure that it's not an issue (for
instance, by using an SELinux policy...)
