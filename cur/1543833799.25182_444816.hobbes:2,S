Reiser4 plug-ins have (had?) the ability to alter the semantics of 
things, like making files into directories inside which you could see 
meta-files like file/uid and file/size which contained meta-data and 
such accessible as normal files to all the unix tools (which is a very 
good idea IMO). You could get things like chmod by just 'echo root 
 >file/owner' or something, very nice.
This was frowned upon by kernel developers who felt that it belonged in 
the kernel VFS (if at all), rather than in reiser4 directly.
