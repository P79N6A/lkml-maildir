A pointer in user space is not a pointer in kernel space! Kernel data
is referenced by a discriptor, referenced as KERNEL_DS, which is not
accessible from user-mode privilege.
You can use mmap() to map kernel data (if you know where it is) to
user-space. However, modification from user-mode code will give
problems with atomicity.
If you need to access to kernel data, you should use an installable
module. Here, the mapping to KERNEL_DS is done for you, and you
can copy_from_user(), copy_to_user(), with the required translation
and, paging done for you. Typical copy using read() from a device
driver runs at between 300 to 750 megabytes per second, depending
upon the CPU, speed, and cache characteristics.
