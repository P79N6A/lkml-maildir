I didn't look at raid driver code, I mean they can setup and use luns
however they want, as they are not following any scsi transport specs.
In drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_iocb.c qla2x00_start_scsi(), it is swapped as
firmware wants le, and then the firmware has to convert it to a proper 8
byte LUN:
	cmd_pkt->lun = cpu_to_le16(sp->cmd->device->lun);
(I'm not sure where or how they handle 8 byte LUN for qla24xx per Ravin's
email).

Yes :)
