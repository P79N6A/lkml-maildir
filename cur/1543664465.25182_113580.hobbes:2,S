I want to correct the cumulative part:

The error interrupt is generated based on the real error bits and
readable ESR bits does not affect the interrupt generation (did verify
with the architects). We need the back-to-back write only to make the
readable ESR to get 0 on a read. So, the interrupt handler should be
able to use the write to ESR and read of ESR to get the current error
status.
Thanks,
Asit
