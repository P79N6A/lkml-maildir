They are atomic against interrupts on the same CPU. And on Linux
also atomic against preempt moving you to another CPU. And all that
without the cost of a bus lock. And that is what local_t is about.

Ok we'll need a local64_t then. No big deal - can be easily added.
Or perhaps better a long_local_t so that 32bit doesn't need to
pay the cost.
