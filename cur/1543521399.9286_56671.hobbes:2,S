It's joke, right ? This particular problem is known for more then year, was
discussed MANY times @ linux-kernel and still there are no solution in
mainstream kernel :-((
P.S. Oh and it's not all story: you can use SysV shared memory support to make
exploit usable even if admin limited your memory usage ! It's also well-known
problem without solution in mainstream kernel :-(
