Right, we'll need it untli we finally free the image, so I think it should be
set/reset in disk.c:pm_suspend_disk().
However, there's a problem with this approach wrt the userland suspend, because
we'd have to keep PF_MEMALLOC set accross ioctls and I wouldn't like to do
this.
Well, the alternative solution would be to take the ZONE_DMA's lowmem reserve
into account in our free memory computations.
Greetings,
Rafael
