FWIW, most PC's I've encountered don't let you set the CMOS clock back
beyond 1980. (Once I tried to boot a Linux system with the clock set past
2038; the date in Linux was automatically turned back exactly 100 years
IIRC.)
I don't have time right now to test this for Feb. 29th compliance, but I
believe that setting the year to 1996 and having the date command add 4
years should work, as should any other combinations involving the date
command adding multiples of four years. Perhaps having date just add any
arbitrary amount of time will also work, but I don't have time to test that
either.
