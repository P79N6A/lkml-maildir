FWIW, you've been able to build the Fedora SRPMs with --with-vanilla
for a while now, which generates an RPM with no patches at all other
than the -rc/-git on which its based.
We're trying to work out logistics of which repository etc we're
going to host this in, but soon we'll be able to just offer
'yum install kernel-vanilla' to users.
