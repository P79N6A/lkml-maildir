Subject: [Patch] don't kick ALB in the presence of pinned task
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Jack Steiner brought this issue at my OLS talk.
Take a scenario where two tasks are pinned to two HT threads in a physical
package. Idle packages in the system will keep kicking migration_thread
on the busy package with out any success.
We will run into similar scenarios in the presence of CMP/NUMA.
Patch appended.
