	No...  "Most" applications should not include those, true.  There are
still utilities like "smbmount" which must have some understanding of kernel
internals across interfaces.  I ran into a bitch of a time when glibc and
the kernel did not agree on "sizeof uid_t".  All of a sudden, certain ioctl's
broke because smbmount needed to know the kernel's concept of a uid, not
glibc's concept.
