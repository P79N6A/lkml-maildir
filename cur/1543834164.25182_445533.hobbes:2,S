It could be improved in two ways in order to better convince people:
Firstly, mention some (perhaps even all) of the actual technical
issues preventing the inclusion of Reiser4. Right now, you are
giving much space to the political issues (or their non-existence).
This answers a different question ("Why we are fed up with the
Reiser4 discussion") than the one in the title, and in the worst
case might leave a reader with the impression that political
reasons are more important after all.
Secondly, the questions in the FAQ part should probably be put in a
less loaded form. For example, Q1 could just read objectively:
"Why can't Reiser4 be included as an experimental feature?"
As it stands now, I fear too many people's reaction upon reading it
will be: "That's not my question." At least leave off the plaintive
initial "but" on Q1 and Q2. It puts off the readers you want to
convince.
