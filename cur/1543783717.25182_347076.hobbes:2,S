We add syscalls all the time.  Whichever user<->kernel API is considered to
be most appropriate, use it.

I'm not questioning the use of a filesystem.  I'm questioning this
overloading of normal filesystem system calls.  For example (and this is
just an example!  there's also mknod, mkdir, O_RDWR, O_EXCL...) it would be
more usual to do
	fd = open("/sys/whatever", ...);
	err = sys_dlm_trylock(fd);
I guess your current implementation prevents /sys/whatever from ever
appearing if the trylock failed.  Dunno if that's valuable.

(wonders how to do O_NONBLOCK from a script)
I don't buy the general "fs is nice because we can script it" argument,
really.  You can just write a few simple applications which provide access
to the syscalls (or the fs!) and then write scripts around those.
Yes, you suddenly need to get a little tarball into users' hands and that's
a hassle.  And I sometimes think we let this hassle guide kernel interfaces
(mutters something about /sbin/hotplug), and that's sad.
