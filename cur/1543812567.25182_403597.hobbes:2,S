Subject: Readahead value 128K? (was Re: Drastic Slowdown of 'fseek()' Calls From 2.4 to 2.6 -- VMM Change?)

Does this happen with a seek call as well, or is this limited
to fseek?
if you look at "hdparm's" idea of read-ahead, what does it say
for the device?.  I.e.:
hdparm /dev/hda:
There is a line entitled "readahead".  What does it say?
I noticed that this seems to default to "256" sectors, or 128K
in 2.6.
This may be unrelated, but what does the kernel do with
this number?  I seem to remember this being set to ~8-16 (4-8K)
in 2.4.  I thought it was the number of sectors to read ahead, by
default, when a read was done, but I haven't noticed a performance
degradation like I would expect for such a large read-ahead value.
On the other hand: you do seem to be experiencing something consistent
with that setting.  I'm not sure under what circumstances the kernel
uses the "readahead" value as a number of sectors to read ahead...
Have the disk read routines changed with respect to this value?
