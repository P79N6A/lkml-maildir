During the INIT phase after the inital kernel bootup! 
I am using RH 9.0 on a Dell Laptop c840 Latitude. 
Is this devpts not part of the 2.5 kernels?  Maybe I need to remove it from 
the modules.conf file in the /etc dir? 
WHat has Happened to the "modversions.h" file in the 2.5 kernels.  Some 
applications need that source file in order to compile correctly!!
