One other thing that could be added is a change in the initcalls .
ks0108 should be subsys_initcall() and the LCD devices
device_initcall(). That would make sure one runs before the other. I
don't think that alone would fix the crash tho. I didn't suggest it
before cause I think the order of the sources in the build system might
do this implicitly even if both are in device_initcall ..
