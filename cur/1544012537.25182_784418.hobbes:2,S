Mauro & Ingo,
If the cx18 warning message is fixed in the following diff, that I
culled from a LKML posting by Ingo on 29 Nov, then Ingo's patch for
cx18-mailbox.c should be overcome by events in the latest v4l-dvb repo.
"req" is now always assigned a value before it is ever used.  (Sorry, I
didn't want to pull the > 100 MB git/tip down over my dialup connection
to verify this was the item in question).
