I think devfs names are accepted as root= arguments, so that's a bit of
a loss.. with udev, your /dev and your root= are equal only if you
follow the standard naming.
For root=, I can see how early userspace can move that to userspace.
But what about swsuspend?
Are there any more kernel options taking file names? I think now would
be a good time to stop adding more of them :)
