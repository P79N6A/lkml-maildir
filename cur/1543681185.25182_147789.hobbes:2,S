Look at this :
	timeo = sock_rcvtimeo(sk, nonblock);

Yes, with OOBINLINE you need to take care of EPOLLPRI if you want to use
the read(2) trick. The OOB virtually break the read.

These are streams and you can use the read(2) trick w/out problems. I
don't think you want to mount your XML parser over UDP.
