2.4.7 has the apm=on bug and won't suspend either... I'm beginning to
suspect that something else is afoot, but I might as well try 2.4.2... 
Funny, with 2.4.2, "apm=on" seems to work as expected, and the first time I
tried "apm --suspend", the screen blanked but nothing else appeared to
happen.  When I hit a key, the suspend command appeared to still be running.
I switched to a different vc and did a "ps ax", it looked like it was  stuck
in the middle of trying to unmount an smbfs filesystem.
Next time I booted up, I umounted the smbfs system and did an "apm
--suspend" that appears to have shut everything down... And when I hit the
power button, it comes up again, albeit with an incredibly dim screen (a
common problem on this Dell Latitude C600).
So, from the point of view of my laptop, something important seems to have
changed between 2.4.2 and 2.4.7.

How would I find out what driver(s) might be vetoing my suspend request?
