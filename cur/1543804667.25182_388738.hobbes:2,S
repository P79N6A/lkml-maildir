No, that doesn't fix this testcase.
We need to somehow tell the compiler "this assembly statement altered
memory and you can't cache memory contents across it".  That's what
"memory" (ie: barrier()) does.  I don't think there's a way of telling gcc
_what_ memory was clobbered - just "all of memory".
