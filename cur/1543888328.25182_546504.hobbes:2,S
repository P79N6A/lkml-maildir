Using sata_sil (SiI 3512) with a ST3120827AS disk here.
For me the COMRESET happens after resume (s2ram):
[    2.174342] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Starting disk
[    2.476407] ata1: device not ready (errno=-19), forcing hardreset
[    2.476429] ata2: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 310)
[    2.931793] ata1: COMRESET failed (errno=-19)
[    2.931797] ata1: reset failed (errno=-19), retrying in 10 secs
[   12.918421] ata1: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)
[   12.921957] ata1.00: ata_hpa_resize 1: sectors = 234441648, hpa_sectors = 234441648
[   12.925908] ata1.00: ata_hpa_resize 1: sectors = 234441648, hpa_sectors = 234441648
With your patch applied the output is:
[    2.173369] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Starting disk
[    2.475431] ata1: device not ready (errno=-19), forcing hardreset
[    2.475453] ata2: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 310)
[    3.592930] ata1: COMRESET failed (errno=-19)
[    3.592934] ata1: reset failed (errno=-19), retrying in 9 secs
[   12.917446] ata1: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)
[   12.920969] ata1.00: ata_hpa_resize 1: sectors = 234441648, hpa_sectors = 234441648
[   12.924945] ata1.00: ata_hpa_resize 1: sectors = 234441648, hpa_sectors = 234441648
Resume takes now ten seconds or more, while it used to take only a few seconds,
what changed? A few kernel versions ago (2.6.21-rc or so?) it retried in 5 seconds
instead of 10, but even that is too long.
Maybe a silly question, but why do we wait for the harddisk to show up? Maybe that
makes a little bit of sense at bootup, but for resume from ram, where nothing is
supposed to have changed, it seems a bit strange. Why not wait when something tries
to access the harddisk or something?
I wonder if sil_pci_device_resume() and sd_resume() know about each other...
I'll disable sd_resume() and see how that goes.
