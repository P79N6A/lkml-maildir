make_bad_inode() is called from ext3_read_inode() that is called from iget() only.
When we found that inode is bad we will call iput ASAP. I expect it should be
enough to exclude any chances to call any functions that can include this inode
into orphan list.
ext3_lookup
  iget
    ext3_read_inode
       make_bad_inode
  is_bad_inode? --> iput
However am I probably err?
Probably is better to add is_bad_inode check to ext3_orphan_add()?
thank you,
