Uppon arriving at work today, I found on the console this message
who explain what happened.
VFS: No free dquots, contact mvw@planets.elm.net
That's why the process was frozen. I ran out of dquot structures.
I added 
 echo 4096 > /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max
to rc.local,  rebooted and now all seems to work ok.
Sorry for the bad report.  Next time I will make more
tests before reporting a problem.
Christian Robert,
Poly.
