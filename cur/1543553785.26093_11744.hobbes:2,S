   It looks very like to me like a poster child for the non timestamp
   RTT update problem I just described on netdev. Linux always
   retransmits too early and there is never a better RTT estimate
   which could fix it.
I thought so too, _BUT_ see my analysis of the Linux side vs.
Win98 side logs, they don't match up and therefore something
is mangling the packets in the middle.  The TCP sequence numbers are
being changed!
Also, if your theory were true then 2.2.x would be affected
by it as well.
