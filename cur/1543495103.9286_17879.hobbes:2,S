John Fulmer <jfulmer@appin.org> sez :
	"My reply in THIS thread was that Plan 9
	 was never a mainstream commercial
	 sucess, and commending on Ken Thompson's
	 use of the phrase "[Linux] will
	 probably not be very suscessful"."
	"I remember a lot of buzz in the mid 90's
	 that Plan 9 was designed to be the next
	 "Unix killer", and then the project got
	 pulled. If you go through Bell Labs web
	 pages on Plan 9, there is a comment that
	 there is no on at Bell working on it,
	 instead most members got pulled to Inferno,
	 or other projects."
	"AND I stated that my impression was that
	 technically, Plan 9 was a very good and
	 elegant system. It just didn't go anywhere."
- ------------------------------------------------------------
Plan-9 suffered the same fate as OS/2, NeXT, and BeOS. Despite the elegances and
innovations of all the above products, they've flopped in the marketplace
because they were wrongly positioned.
This is how they have been positioned:
	IBM positioned OS/2 as "A Better Window than Windows";
	Plan-9 was positioned as "Unix-NG";
	NeXT was positioned as a "More Intuitive Mac"; and
	BeOS tried to be a "Better Power-PC".
All of them have failed because they tried to be "Better Mousetraps."
	Anyone studied Marketing 101 knows that
	the "Better Mousetrap" concept won't work
	if the "Old Mousetrap" has a significant
	following, and unfortunately, IBM, Bell-labs,
	NeXT and Be Corp have failed their Marketing 101.
One of the things that makes Linux popular is this: 
	Linux has never tried to be a "Better Version"
	of _anything_ that is currently in the marketplace.
Instead, Linux is a by-product of a social/cultural phenomenon.
	People contributed to the development of Linux
	not because they want Linux to become a _better_
	something, but they do it because they believe in
	themselves.
	They believe that, own their own, they can create
	something that is _different_ - something that can
	stand on its own, no matter what the outside world
	throws at it.
It is that Spirit of Independence that attracts thousands of volunteers around
the world.
	It is therefore no surprise that Linus, - and many other kernel
	developers, - vehemently rejected repeated attempts to attach
	the "gnu" (or any other) label to Linux.
True, Linux _DID_ borrowed many ideas from other sources, including gnu, X-Free,
*bsd, other *nixes, and yes, even from Ken Thompson's Plan-9. BUT, Linux is
much, _much_ more than the sums of all the sources combined.
	Without the developers who have spent many
	sleepless nights hacking away, without the
	many diversified supplementary projects such
	as dosemu, SAMBA and many others - some of
	them rather odd -that have sprung up around
	the kernel,Linux couldn't have become as 
	significant as it is today.
Linux may be unix "compatible", but Linux isn't Unix. Linux may have components
from FreeBSD, but it ain't *bsd either. Linux may be Motif, Posix, or any other
alphabet-soup-thingy complianced, but it ain't gonna be restricted by any of
them.
	If anyone think they can "own" or even "tame"
	Linux, that fella is gonna be in a biggest
	surprise of his/her life.
In this ever-increasing conforming world we live in, the longer Linux can retain
its independence and keep that uncompromized, non-comforming attitude, the more
Linux will attract new talents to contribute in its development. Thus, the day
Linux achieves its world-domination is the day Linux starts its decline.
Well, I hope that day will never come.
Sincerely,
Pete
