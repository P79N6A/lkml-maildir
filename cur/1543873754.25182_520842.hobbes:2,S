How about you send over the autofs4 bit and I'll have a look (the autofs
patch looked fine). That would save me a bit of time and if there are
any changes needed I can send an updated patch for you guys to review. I
don't think autofs4 uses pids differently, in principle, than autofs so
it "should" be straight forward.
