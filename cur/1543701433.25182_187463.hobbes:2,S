Hello,
I am experiencing consistent lockups of the linux kernel when I play chess
with crafty.  What happens is that while the chess engine is running,
suddenly the whole system will freeze, and the only think I can get to
work is the reboot button.  I have tried to put the computer in text-mode
(telinit 3) and run the chess program (with gui) from another computer on
my LAN, to see if any oops-output would show up, but there is nothing.
My system runs Redhat 7.2 and is uptodate with patches (so I'm running
kernel version 2.4.20-24.7 #1, athlon version).  The chess program is
Crafty 17.9.  The processor is "AMD Athlon(tm) 4 Processor".
/var/log/messages shows nothing of interest.
I wonder if this scarse information is good for anything.  And in any
case, thanks for all your great work which I benefit from every day!!
