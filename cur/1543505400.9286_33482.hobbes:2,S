I just tried 2.2.11 with the SB1000 cable modem and the proc doesnt
update with the cm0 interface in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf.  I am not
very proficient at finding the causes of this sort of thing, so I'd
thought I'd ask here :)  The cable modem works fine in stock 2.2.10.
The driver is a module written by Franco Venturi.  If any of you have
hints, or anyone using the cable modem in Linux fine, please drop me a
few hints.
