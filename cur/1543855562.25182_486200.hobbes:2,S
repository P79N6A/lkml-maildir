This is far from obvious, and in my opinion incorrect. David explained
this very well in his follow-up. Other pertinent references are
Gutterman Pinkas Reinman '06 [1], Barak and Halevi '05 [2, Section 5.1],
and the "/dev/random is probably not" thread [3].
The current algorithm is probably OK for casual users in normal
circumstances, but advertising it as absolutely secure is dangerously
misleading.
