BUG in kernel 2.2.15pre2 (also earlier kernels begnning from 2.2.13 and
maybe even earlier ones, I have got related oopses with 2.2.13, 2.2.14pre,
2.2.14 earlier):
attempts to remove non running task from runqueue 
Normally it's ends with kernel oops but I put some debugging output and protection in procedure
del_from_runqueue() in kernel/sched.c. Unfortunatelly I don't have real patch
that fixes the problem, but only one that outputs error message and
    sched.c.diff      - patch I applied
    kernel.log        - messages I got in log file (beginning from
		     boot)
    ps_ax              - output of 'ps ax'. So we can see that affected
                              is maudio. As far as I remember in earlier cases
		      it was either maudio or kwm (I cannot tell more
		      about cases system simply freezed)
    .config             - kernel configuration file from menuconfig
    000108.oops     - earlier output of ksymoops (without patched 
		      kernel/sched.c so I got oopses instead of simply
		      error messages. Kernel were 2.2.14 then). This at least
                              have stack trace so one can see how schedule() is
                              called
