Read as: it doesn't make sense to have per-fd state on a single floppy
device given that there's only one actual hardware instance associated
with it and multiple openers don't make sense. Opening a floppy at
different densities with magic filenames was an example Linus used earlier
in the thread. Surely there can be more than one drive and more than one
serial port.
