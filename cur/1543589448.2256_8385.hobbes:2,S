glibc is bloated because it cares about such stuff and complex standards.
There is no reason to make a mess of the kernel when you can handle more
stuff nicely with the libraries.
Since glibc inlines most memcpy calls you'd need to build an MXT glibc,
which is doable. Uninlining most memcpy calls is a loss on some processors
and often a loss anyway as the copies are so small
