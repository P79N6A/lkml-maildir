Uhh, so what's wrong with "int" or "long"?  On all existing archs
supported by linux, "int" is 32 bits, "long long" is 64 bits, and
"long" is an efficient word-sized value that can hold a casted
pointer.  I suppose it's theoretical that linux could be ported to
some arch where int is 16 bits, but so much stuff implicitly depends
on at least 32-bits in int that I think that's unlikely.  GCC will
generally do the right thing if you just tell it "int".
