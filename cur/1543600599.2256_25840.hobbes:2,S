Yes, a simple thought experiment show this.  Suppose we start with an intial 
state of every second 0 order page allocated.  Now, the next 0 order 
allocation must coalesce to a 1 order unit but the next allocate will come 
from a half-allocated allocated unit.  If we continue randomly in this way, 
allocating one page and freeing one, we will eventually arrive at a state 
where half the pages are in 1 order units and the other half are fully 
allocated.
So, the fragmentation is far from uniformly random.  This is going to require 
deeper analysis.  IMO, it's worth putting in the effort to get a handle on 
this.
