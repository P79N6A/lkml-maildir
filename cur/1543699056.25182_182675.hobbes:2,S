Maybe you shouldn't do that.  Other drivers maintain their own data 
structure separately from the struct usb_device and with its own lock.  
But usbfs may suffer from complications as a result of its unorthodox 
approach to device ownership.

If you would keep the ps->devsem lock, would there be any problem in 
setting ps->dev to NULL to indicate disconnection?
Are they any reasons for not keeping ps->devsem?  Since usbfs generally 
acts as a driver and drivers generally don't have to concern themselves 
with usbdev->serialize (the core handles it for them), shouldn't usbfs 
also be able to ignore ps->dev->serialize?
