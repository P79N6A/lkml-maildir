I'm using v0.99 (latest available).
Also note when I do enable the mysterios "MFGPT workaround" option in

The relevant part would be:
[   23.092507] NET: Registered protocol family 16
[   23.105875] geode-mfgpt:  8 MFGPT timers available
[   23.120247] geode-mfgpt:  Registered timer 0
[   23.133076] mfgpt-timer:  registering the MFGT timer as a clock event.
