All of it.

All of it, too. The old DMA controller(s) could only address 16 MB
because that's all the page-registers allowed. Bus-mastering DMA
off the PCI/Bus has no such limitation. Most have DMA controllers
that use scatter-lists so RAM doesn't even have to be contiguous,
only properly allocated (in pages) and nailed down with no caching.

If you are looking for a dynamic buffer in DMA-able RAM, you probably
can only use aout 1GB, but that's not how to do DMA.
