Hi.
By default -ck1 uses the default I/O scheduler which is anticipatory.
You can set the cfq scheduler (as I recommend and write in my faq) by
adding the boot command:
elevator=cfq
This does not include ionice, though, as the version of ionice that Jens
published was getting quite old and only worked with a much slower
version of the cfq scheduler. I had to drop that version in favour of
the higher throughput cfq scheduler in mainline. See how you go with jus
the normal cfq elevator first.
Hopefully Jens will resync his ionice work with the current cfq
scheduler. As soon as he does I'll include it in -ck ;-)
Cheers,
Con
