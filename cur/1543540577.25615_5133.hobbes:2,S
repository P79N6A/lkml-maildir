The issue isnt political correctness but design correctness here. DocBook 
properly labels content not style, which Linuxdoc isnt doing right.

I wonder how all my docbook files got converted into ascii. Actually there
are several two stage answers
	db2html, lynx -dump
	db2rtf then rtf2ascii
As to Jade - it works, it does the job. Its a complete horror to install but
thats ok because you get the rpms or debs for it.
