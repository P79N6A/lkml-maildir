Hello everyone;
I saw some talk on this mailing list about 9 months ago about the Marvell 
88SE6141 Sata II not being recognized.
I just went from FC5 to a new Fedora Core 6 install, and even updated to 
the latest kernel 2.6.20-1.2925 on an x86_64.
The kernel is not seeing my 2nd set of 4 Sata II ports provided by the 
Marvell chipset.  It doesn't matter if I enable the raid management boot 
prom option or not.
I'm having no problems with the 4 Intel Sata II ports.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Tony
