Well, DocBook documentation isn't need for normal builds either and has
jade as dependency - something that can less often be found on GNU/Linux
in my opinion.
Why can't I assume that perl is installed? It can be found on every
standard Linux/Unix installation.
And besides, the bug report script doesn't replace anything the doesn't
need perl - ver_linux, REPORTING-BUGS and oops-tracing.txt are still there
for the more advanced user.
My script is intended for the one who likes to provide bug reports but is
too lazy to look up all the information or simply is not sure about what
to include.
Starting with my script to generate their reports, the users can customize
the reports and also write them by hand if they feel like doing so.
