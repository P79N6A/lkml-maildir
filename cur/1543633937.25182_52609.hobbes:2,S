Shrug.  Preference I guess... though this is _the_ case for BUG_ON.

I disagree, but OK.  I like having the #if marked by the #endif if they
are not close... and elsewhere through the kernel mirrors this.  While I
can scroll up and look - assuming the nesting is sane - a simple comment
makes that clear so what is the pain?

Rest looks fine.
Then again, this is all invariants and comments so its really not a big
deal at all.  I guess better this than we are fighting over real code,
eh? ;-)
