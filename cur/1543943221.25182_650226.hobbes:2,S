Yeah, but it is going from _all_ submitting CPUs to the one completing
CPU. So you could bottleneck the interconnect at the completing CPU
just as much as if you had cachelines being pulled the other way (ie.
many CPUs trying to pull in a global cacheline).

OK, once you add locking (and not simply cacheline contention), then
the problem gets harder I agree. But I think that if the submitting
side takes the same locks as log completion (eg. maybe for starting a
new transaction), then it is not going to be a clear win either way,
and you'd have to measure it in the end.
