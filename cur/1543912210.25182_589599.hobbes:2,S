Oh yes, sorry.

This code is gone in v2.

Good point.

I need to add a comment somewhere mentioning that if you patch with
something less than 3 bytes, then you should pad with nop but the
hypervisor must treat the whole instruction (including the padding) as
atomic (that is, regardless of hypercall size, eip += 3) or you run the
risk of breakage during migration.
