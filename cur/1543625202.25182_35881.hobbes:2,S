It's not listed as such because it's an output (the second output),
not a clobber.  This is particularly common on x86 where registers are
so specialized that they all have their own constraint letters.
Incidentally, the above asm statement is technically incorrect, "=&a"
(d0) means eax is an "early clobber", however, the instruction doesn't
require it to be early clobbered.
