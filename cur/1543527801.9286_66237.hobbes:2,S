When does it look hostile?  Does a simple DNS query look hostile?
How about some poor sucker whose hardware gets hosed, and he wants to
find out the time from someone elses "time" service?  Is he hostile
if he scans for open "time" ports?
I used to use rdate every time I rebooted because of such a hardware
problem.  Best I could do was such a scan on the metalab.unc.edu subnet.
Every few weeks they'd shut off the time server on the machine I was
using though.
