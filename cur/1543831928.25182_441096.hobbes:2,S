You are completely missing the point. Our background is that all NFS
clients are required to use the mtime and ctime timestamps in order to
figure out if their cached data is valid. They need to do this extremely
frequently (in fact, every time you open() the file).
Nobody gives a rats arse about backups: those are infrequent and
can/should use more sophisticated techniques such as checksumming.
