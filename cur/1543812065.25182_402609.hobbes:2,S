*boggle*, there really are only two single-core CPUs in there,
with no empty sockets. It's an early stepping of the motherboard
too that supposedly doesn't support dual-core.  So why these are present
at all, let alone 'disabled' is a mystery to me.
logrotate ate the old logs, so I don't have any old bootlogs
to grep through, but I'll take your word for it :)
Why ACPI decides to create 3 processor entries is still odd though.
