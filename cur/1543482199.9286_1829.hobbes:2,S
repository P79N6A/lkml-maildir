It would work.  Config Language has string-valued variables and they work
fine in all interpreters.  Flag dependencies take care of recompiling
the source when people change the flags.
The drawback is that it opens the door for more people to build bogus
kernels by accident.
In the specific case of -fno-strength-reduce, I favor just leaving
it alone for another year or so.  Seriously.  It doesn't bite people
in the ass all the time the way SMP configuration did.
