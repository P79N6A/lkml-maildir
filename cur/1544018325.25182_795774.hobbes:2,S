You had a init/kerntypes.c in sles9 and sles10. It included a lot
of basic kernel types.  It was compiled with -g to make the kerntypes.
I presume that you used the LKCD project's lcrash with the kerntypes.
If you download lkcd (lkcd.svn.sourceforge.net) you also build a
tool called dwarfextract.  It is able to pull all the structure
definitions out of a -g (CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO) kernel and any selected
modules.  That is useful with the lcrash command.
If you want to analyze your live system or a dump with the crash command
(people.redhat.com/~anderson/) you don't need the kerntypes, as you use
the -g kernel itself.  Although you may make kerntypes with dwarfextract
and use them with crash also.
