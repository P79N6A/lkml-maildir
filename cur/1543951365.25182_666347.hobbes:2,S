Nope.  I am running baadac8b10c5ac15ce3d26b68fa266c8889b163f now, and it 
still hangs on reboot or power-off.
Interestingly, if I reboot -immediately- from gdm, it succeeds.  However 
if I login to Fedora GNOME via gdm, and load my standard apps (1001 
terminals, firefox, tbird, IRC) reboot and poweroff no longer work.
My guess was always some ACPI regression.  I'll bisect today or 
tomorrow.  It is reproducible regression that appeared recently (circa 
2.6.24 or 2.6.25-rc1 I think), so I should be able to find the culprit.
