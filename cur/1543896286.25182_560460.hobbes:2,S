This isn't quite right.
Firstly, it is mdadm which decided to make one drive a 'spare' for
raid5, not the kernel.
Secondly, it only applies to raid5, not raid6 or raid1 or raid10.
For raid6, the initial resync (just like the resync after an unclean
shutdown) reads all the data blocks, and writes all the P and Q
blocks.
raid5 can do that, but it is faster the read all but one disk, and
write to that one disk.
