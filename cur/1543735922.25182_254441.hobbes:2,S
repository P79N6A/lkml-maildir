That change was not the important one.  The important part of the patch 
was this:
+               /* Genesys Logic interface chips need a 100us delay between
+                * the command phase and the data phase */
+               if (us->pusb_dev->descriptor.idVendor == USB_VENDOR_ID_GENESYS)
+                       udelay(100);
This is what affects the timing problem, by adding a 100-microsecond 
delay.
