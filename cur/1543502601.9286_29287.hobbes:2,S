This problem appeared in 2.2.7 that i'm aware of -- i've been trying to
create a new array since that version.  I was succesful in building an
array on 2.2.6, but after that kernel ver, i get the same error as you: "
invalid parameter /dev/md[0,1,2,3]"
I've tried this with 2.2.7, 2.2.8, 2.2.9, 2.2.10, 2.2.10ac10 -- same
results.

2.3.9 works with software raid-0, this fails in 2.3.10
I have two scsi drives connected to an adaptec 2940, combining
/dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 into /dev/md0
Booting 2.3.10 seems to create the array, cat /proc/mdstat
shows md0 created from sda1+sdb1, but inactive.
mdrun -a says "invalid parameter /dev/md0" and trying
to mount /dev/md0 says "access beyond end of device,
it might be a zero-length partition."
The array works fine with 2.3.9 and earlier kernels.
