This is a gcc problem. I has been thinking about flags = 0
initialization, but developers dislike this shutting gcc up.

Yes, I had a patch, which changed only some of locks, but there were
only 2 or 3 spin_locks remaining. It's not a problem to test it
everywhere for little overhead, but maybe yes, I'll remove it from
open, close and block_til_whatever for the final patch.

There were some changes, however nothing significant in mxser.c, maybe
some of tty or ldisc layer changes (but there is only termios ->
ktermios switch + some other things), this would probably be hard to
find without bisecting if 2.6.19 is really OK for you.
The only idea I have right now is to nohup process, which will
int fd = open("/dev/ttyMIXX", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
while (1) {
  ioctl(fd, TIOCMIWAIT, TIOCM_CD);
  ioctl(fd, TIOCMGET, &ret);
  printf("%ld: carrier has changed: %u\n", time(NULL), !!(ret & TIOCM_CD));
}
to prove, if the carrier really becomes low.
regards,
