	Hi Jeff,
	A more "normal" IrDA update this time (drivers, bug fixes) to
flush my patch queue. Some of those patches have been on my web page
for far too long, rediffed on 2.5.41.
	Martin is working on the new irtty driver that should fix the
last remaining big problem with IrDA in 2.5.X. Hopefully you will see
that soon.
	Have fun...
	Jean
----------------------------------------------------------------
[FEATURE] : Add a new feature to the IrDA stack
[CORRECT] : Fix to have the correct/expected behaviour
[CRITICA] : Fix potential kernel crash
ir251_vlsi_v4-2.diff :
--------------------
	        <Following patch from Martin Diehl>
        * merge+sync with changes from recent kernels: pci_[sg]et_drvdata,
          __devexit_p, netdev->last_rx, irda header cleanup
        * add netdev tx_timeout which re-initializes the whole thing
        * add power management support consistent with pci driver api
        * major rework of the ring descriptor operations
        * make correct usage of consistent and streaming pci dma api
        * nuke last virt_to_bus() and friends
        * support MIR/FIR highspeed interaction pulse (SIP)
        * review all paths for packet-size issues (rx and tx)
        * fix an old issue requiring hw powercycle caused by a race
          between IrLAP and hardware when switching _back_ to default
          speed at LAP disconnect. This was opened by the complete async
          behaviour of netdev->xmit but didn't happen before your latency
          improvements went into the stack.
        * add driver status readout under /proc/driver/vlsi_ir/irda%
          For 2.5, this will probably go into driverfs once things have
          stabilized.
        * fix potential deadlock in speed changing code
        * make identical driver working for both 2.4 and 2.5
        * add __attribute__((packed)) to hardware-exposed struct
        * add suggested pci_dma_prep_single() to flush cpu cache before
          streaming dma buffer gets reused for busmastering
ir254_donauboe-2.diff :
---------------------
	        <Following patch from Martin Lucina & Christian Gennerat>
	o [FEATURE] Rewrite of the toshoboe driver using documentation
	o [FEATURE] Support Donau oboe chipsets.
	o [FEATURE] FIR support
	o [CORRECT] Probe chip before opening
	o [FEATURE] suspend/resume support
	o [FEATURE] Numerous other improvements/cleanups
	o [CORRECT] (me) Remove save_flags()/cli() for spinlock
		<Currently, we keep the old toshoboe driver around>

ir251_export_crc-2.diff :
-----------------------

ir251_ircomm_uninit_fix-6.diff :
------------------------------
	o [FEATURE] Fix spelling UNITIALISED => UNINITIALISED

	o [CORRECT] Workaround NULL QoS bitfields
	o [CORRECT] Workaround oversized QoS bitfields
	o [FEATURE] Add sysctl "max_tx_window" to limit IrLAP Tx Window
ir251_lmp_timer_race-2.diff :
---------------------------
	o [CORRECT] Start timer before sending event to fix race condition
	o [FEATURE] Improve the IrLMP event debugging messages.
