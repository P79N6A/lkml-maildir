BTW, (a while ago) I tried doing similar thing from user-space 
using POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED on a file. While it worked great to 
get rid of the pagecache pages for few files, since I had to 
run this on each and every file in the filesystem - it ended 
up bloating inode, dentry slabs :( I really wanted to find out 
what files are really cached in the pagecache to run this on.
Thanks,
