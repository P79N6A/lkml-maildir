It depends how closely the bits are tied. As far as I can ascertain there
is no simple yes/no answer and whether you can do so depends a great deal
upon how tightly bound the two are (consider the difference between the
intel ipw daemon which is integrated very tightly into the old ipw3945
driver and  a script monitoring CPU temperature via a sysfs file)
