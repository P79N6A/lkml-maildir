        Hi Marcelo,
	It seems that the previous set of IrDA patches for 2.4.22 got
lost somewhere. As I really want them in 2.4.22-preX, I'm resubmitting
the whole set.
	Those patches :
	o have been tested by me on 2.4.22-pre1
	o have been in 2.5.X for over 6 months
	o have been on my web page for over 6 months
	o are needed by many Linux-IrDA users
	o fixes essential IrDA bugs and are limited in scope.
	Patches to follow in separate e-mail...
	Thanks in advance...
	Jean
