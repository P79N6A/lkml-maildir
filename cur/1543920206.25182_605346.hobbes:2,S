The kernel build system supports parallel make and I guess all
kernel developers use it. People tell me that a 32 way machine is
quite good for kernel compilation.
The bottleneck is that we spawn so many make instances and each have
to read all the same makefiles and stat in total a zillion files
for a simple kernel build.
With a single Makefile we can run a single instance make where
we read all files only once and stat the same file only once.
