What's your uptime?
I've been able to get "Committed AS" to just grow and grow with a kernel
compile within a while loop after a couple days (pii 350, so faster machines
should show that sooner...).
When you get a chance, go into single user mode and see if "Committed AS"
goes down to a sane level.  If not, you're seeing what I am.
I've seen it without highmem, with and without smp, etc. more info available
upon request.
