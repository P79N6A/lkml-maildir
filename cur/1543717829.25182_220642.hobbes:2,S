It was a necessary step.  To get around this, we're going to ask people
to submit new machine support on a file by file basis, and that's just
not practical, and you can't expect me to be able to track _every_
_single_ fscking change to the kernel, and pick up every one in a
review.
There will always be a delay between changes happening between two people
and we have to live with it.  Not everyone works on Linus' latest kernel.
