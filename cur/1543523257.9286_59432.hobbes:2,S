Hi,
I'm the LMC guy doing the driver. 
Currently we only do syncppp/chdlc since we use the kernels syncppp
module.  I (LMC included) would love to do frame realy. I've taken a very
quick look at the frame relay module but it seems like there's a LAT of
work to add frame relay support.  With everyones time being limited I've
had to tackle more pressing issues.  
We're currently looking at a few optoins though the most promessing one
seems to be buying a closed source frame relay stack from one of our
parteners.  :( I'de hate to have to do this, so if anyone can provide
pointers at docs or ideas on how to add fr to the driver I'de greatly
appreciate it.
Thanks,
Andrew
