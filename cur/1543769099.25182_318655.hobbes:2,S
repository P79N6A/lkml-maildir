Subject: [PATCH] Makefile include path ordering
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/16/239

The arch Makefile may override the include path order, which is
used by Xen (and UML?) to make sure include/asm-xen is searched
before include/asm-i386.
The Makefile change to 2.6.12-rc4 made the top Makefile always
override the value specified by the arch Makefile.  This trivial
patch makes the Xen kernel compile again.
