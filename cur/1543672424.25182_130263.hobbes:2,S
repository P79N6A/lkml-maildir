Yes, I would guess the MO drive doesn't like most commands that are
used for DVD/CD-ROMs and writers.

Okay, I was assuming those errors don't do harm, but that might
be wrong, yeah.

Agreed.

2.5
The solution with ide-scsi is good enough for me on 2.4, but since CD
burning also doesn't need ide-scsi any more on 2.5, I'd like to use a
kernel without any SCSI code in it.

Okay. I'll try to find a way to pass the information that the drive
was originally detected as ide_optical down to ide-cd.c so I can skip
the commands that don't make sense on an MO drive.

I'll go play with the code some more, then.
