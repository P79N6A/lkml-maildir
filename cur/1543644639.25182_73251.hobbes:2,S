Doing it per process prevents some class of problems.  Doing it
per user prevents another class.
Note that this does not limit the user (ulimit type solutions)
when the system is not under stress.  What it does do is make sure
that no one user (or process) can DOS the system.  In other words,
implement a fairness amoung peers (users or processes).
Currently, Linux has fairness amoung threads (since threads and
processes are basically the same as far as the scheduler is
concerned.)
I would be interested in seeing this patch.  A per process thing
would be really cool for what I am building (WorldGate) since
many of the processes are all running as the same user but a per
user thing would also be interesting.
(Or both - processes within a user are fair with each other and
users are fair amoung the other users...)
