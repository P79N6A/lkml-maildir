You didn't use the "TestRTMutex" I send along with the patch :-(
Since I learned to use unittesting that way I have been a big fan. It does
catch a lot of stupid bugs without having to wait for the program to get
there while keeping the ability to debug with gdb and fix it right away.
And most important: you can keep the tests and check if your program still
parses them after a rewrite. Very usefull to prevent repeating bugs.
So here is the issues I have found:
1) grablockBKL.tst failes. Apparently you can "grab" the BKL now? Is this
intended? I have updated the test to accept this.
2) 2locksdeadlock.tst loops forever. It is a livelock: When two RT-tasks
"deadlocks" on two mutexes they keep waking up each other in other. I
quickly fixed that bug.
3) While fixing that I came to think about what happens when you signal a
task blocked on a task blocked on a task. I thus wrote
2lock3tasksBoostSignal.tst. Well, the priorities wasn't set back
correctly. I fixed that too.
I have attached the patch againt 2.6.17-rt17 (and therefore also
included the previous patch) along with the updated tester and tests.
