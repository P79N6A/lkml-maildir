Okay, to confirm I'm on the same page as you, you want to move process 
time accounting from being periodic sampled based to being trace based? 
i.e. at the system-call/interrupt boundaries, read clocksource and 
compute directly the amount of system/user/process time?
Do you know if anyone has explored this?  I thought there was a 
discussion about this a while back but it was rejected due to the 
sample-based approach having much lower overheads on high system call 
rate workloads.
