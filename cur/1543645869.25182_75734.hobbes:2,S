Subject: [BUG] 2.5.40 - aha142x won't build as module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/2/140

Also "make menuconfig" has errors and won't change the module to built-in.
And got missing symbols in ipt_owner with no aha152x support in the
kernel.
Also tried -mm1, same problems.
I barely have time to test kernels this fall when they will compile, so
don't expect any quick fixes from me, I just got 2.5.38-mm2 to boot.
