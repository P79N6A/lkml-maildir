Ok, that's what I get for reading the comment and not deciphering the
code...  The actual calculation is mempages / (THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE) / 8
where THREAD_SIZE is 2 pages on i386.  If I read it right this means it's
limiting it to 1/8 physical memory instead of half.
But there's still a problem.  The value for mempages is all of physical
memory including highmem, so a machine with a sufficient amount of high
memory can set max_threads to a value way too high, given that most if not
all of the resources it's trying to limit have to come from normal memory
and not high memory.
