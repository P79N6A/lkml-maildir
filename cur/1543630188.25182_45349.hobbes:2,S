*boggle* $deity knows how.
I just checked. From a clean 2.4.14, with -dj2 patch applied, that
segment of code reads..
#if SUPPORT_SLOW_DATA_PORTS
        if (drive->channel->slow)
            ata_write_slow(drive, buffer, wcount);
        else
#endif 
            ata_write_16(drive, buffer, wcount);
    }
So this part..

Should reject (or at least say already applied)
It may be patch(1) being funky, and doing something silly like adding the
same patch twice (something thats bitten me a few times, and has also happened
in Linus' tree once or twice).
