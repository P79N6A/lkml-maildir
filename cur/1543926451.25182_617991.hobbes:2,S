Greg, I don't know if this is relevant or not,
but x86 has bugs in the halt/reboot code for SMP.
Specifically, in native_smp_send_stop() the code now uses
spin_trylock() to "lock" the shared call buffers,
but then ignores the result.
This means that multiple CPUs can/will clobber each other
in that code.
The second bug, is that this code does not wait for the
target CPUs to actually stop before it continues.
This was the real cause of the failure-to-poweroff problems
I was having with 2.6.23, which we fixed by using CPU hotplug
to disable_nonboot_cpus() before the above code ever got run.
Maybe it's related, maybe not.
