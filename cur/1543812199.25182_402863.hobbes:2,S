I have another question (brought up by someone working on a series of
ARM machines which make heavy use of MMIO.)
Why isn't pci_enable_device_bars() sufficient - why do we have to
have another interface to say "we don't want BARs XXX" ?
Let's say that we have a device driver which does this sequence (with,
of course, error checking):
	pci_enable_device_bars(dev, 1<<1);
	pci_request_regions(dev);
(a) should PCI remember that only BAR 1 has been requested to be enabled,
    and as such shouldn't pci_request_regions() ignore BAR 0?
(b) should the PCI driver pass into pci_request_regions() (or even
    pci_request_regions_bars()) a bitmask of the BARs it wants to have
    requested, and similarly for pci_release_regions().
Basically, if BAR0 hasn't been enabled, has pci_request_regions() got
any business requesting it from the resource tree?
