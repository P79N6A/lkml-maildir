OK, that should be easy to do.  So let's forget about the 'SMART disabled' 
issue.  This is easy to fix in multiple ways and is not a LKML issue.
David: can you reproduce the more serious problem 
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.utilities.smartmontools/4712
 reported 
by Jan Dvorak?
Jeff: this is the problem that really has me concerned.
Jan: what happens if you replace '-d ata' with '-d sat'?  This option 
should be available in the 5.37 release of smartmontools that you are 
using unless the Suse package maintainer is playing games with the version 
numbers.
Unfortunately I don't think this will fix the problem, as the bug report 
by Klaus Fuerstberger 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=428975
 is using '-d sat'.
Jeff: the fact that both links given above are reporting the same bug in 
two different settings, and the fact that the bug goes away when reverting 
2.6.22 to 2.6.21 still has me concerned.
Cheers,
 	Bruce
