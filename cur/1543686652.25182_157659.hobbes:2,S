Okay, that's the model I have in mind as the driver, assuming you included
seek in that list.

I don't think that's right. A file system may very well be *optimized* for
performance on a certain class of device, but that doesn't make it device
dependent. For example some early SysV filesystems had the directory in
the middle of the platters to minimize seek distance when the partition
was only partially filled. I'd bet I could run JFFS2 on a normal drive,
and I know I can run FAT, ext2, etc on a CF. Now if Linux only knew how to
read SysV.4 drives I could save some critical old data from the 90's, but
that's another issue...

That sounds like a loopback mount, sort of. At least a feature which could
be added fairly easily, like crypto mounts.

Agreed, if you're going to do that type of fakery it's probably better to
take some overhead and not give up good design in the name of performance
for something which is usually limited by other factors like device
performance, or seldom used. Slow and robust is easier to maintain.
