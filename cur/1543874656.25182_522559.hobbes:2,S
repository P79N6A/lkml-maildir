We developed this for an embedded device that runs Linux in which
it is crucial to reach the highest point of security possible
having in mind previous experience on signed executable code
developing under WindowsCE. The end user has nothing to do with the 
system, no logons
A malicious person may want to alter code on the detachable (and unsafe) 
file system.
Lots of stuff including the kernel will be in a trapped casing (opening, 
probing it, power
analyzing it, heating it etc will result in system suicide and erasure)
If one alters one device then he can go on and play with it at home
But if one finds the key that authenticates the executable code it will 
be possible to
attack and tamper the non-system software on some of the networked devices
That is why we can't use symmetric, the risk is a lot greater there. And 
of course
we cant have one key per device (maybe thousands)

Of course we are talking about a restricted execution enviroment, no 
user logons
the system runs what it is supposed to run, and only that
If we where to use a userland program then we would propably have to 
physically
secure the whole filesystem, and that is difficult, costs more, and it 
is cumbersome
(difficult to update)

You are not going to check all at once but only on load. I tell you 
again this is
not going to be running as a web server, but in a restricted environment
As for the code bloat and complexity... well you know its up to u to use 
it or leave it
dont include where you don't need it.
I mean we created for our specific use, other may want to use it to 
(maybe for
the same reasons, who knows) why not make it available? Isn't that what 
open source
is about?
And on the bottom line, why not have a module and functionality that Linux
competitors provide and advertise?
