of course, that's the other 10%. [or even smaller.] I never claimed M:N
cannot be viable for certain specific applications. But a generic
threading library should rather concentrate on the common 90% of the
applications.
(obviously for simulations the absolute fastest implementation would be a
pure userspace state-machine, not a threaded application - M:N or 1:1.)
