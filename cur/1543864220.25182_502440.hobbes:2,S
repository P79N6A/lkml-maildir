With this daily taxes, you can go to a good resort in Brazil (breakfast 
and maybe lunch included) if you organize the event to not be on 
Jul/Jan/Feb.
Probably, such event can be organized by professionals on about 6 months 
before it, at least in Brazil. To be conservative, it should be programmed 
by August of the previous year, to allow companies that may help founding 
the event to reserve some money on their budget.
So, if the event would happen on September, IMHO, the better would be 
to programm it about 14-12 months before it, just due to budget issues.
