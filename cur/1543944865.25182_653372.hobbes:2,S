Agreed - with the expect of stuff which is used in tree or forms part of
a logical exported API we should just throw them out without messing. The
only exceptions I can see that make sense are
- Where a subsystem maintainer says not to
- Where we know that a commonly used out of tree module needs it
Most of the excess symbols should thus just go away. Its pretty unlikely
that they are being used.
