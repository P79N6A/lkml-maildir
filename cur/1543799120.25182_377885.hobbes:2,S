I agree with your analysis Nicolas.
However, don't forget to compare this with our existing semaphore
implementation which is 9 instructions, or 8 for the SMP version.
In total, this means that mutexes will be _FAR MORE EXPENSIVE_ on ARM
than our semaphores.
Forcing architectures down the "lets make everything generic" path
does not always hack it.  It can't do by its very nature.  Generic
implementations are *always* sub-optimal and it is pretty clear
that any gain that mutexes _may_ give is completely wasted on ARM
by the overhead of having a generic framework imposed upon us.
So, to sum up, if this path is persued, mutexes will be a bloody
disaster on ARM.  We'd be far better off sticking to semaphores
and ignoring this mutex stuff.
