Any of the sd/ck/cfs schedulers are an improvement on the current 
mainline, and hopefully they will continue to cross pollinate and 
evolve. Perhaps by 2.6.23 a clear "best" will emerge, or Linus will 
change his mind and make sd and cfs be compile options at build time.

I did some kernel compile timing numbers as part of my work with 
ctxbench, and there is little to choose between the schedulers under 
load, although the special case for sched_yield makes some loads perform 
better with cfs. With large memory and fast disk, a kernel make becomes 
a CPU benchmark, there's virtually no iowait not filled with another 
process.

The glitch1 script generates a number of CPU bound processes updating 
the screen independently, which stresses both graphics performance and 
scheduler fairness. And once again I note that it's a *characterization* 
rather than a benchmark. The ability of the scheduler to deliver the 
same resources to multiple identical processes, and to keep another CPU 
bound process (glxgears) getting the processor at regular intervals is 
more revealing than the frames per second or loops run.
I would expect sd to be better at this, since it uses a deadline 
concept, but in practice the gears pause, and then move rapidly or 
appear to jump. My reading on this is that the process starves for some 
ms, then gets a lot of CPU because it is "owed" more. I think I see this 
in games, but not being a game player I can't tell from experience if 
it's artifact or the games suck. That's what my test rig, based on a 15 
year old boy and several cans of high caffeine soda, is used for. ;-)
