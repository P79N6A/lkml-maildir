Subject: [PATCH 00/02] [RFC] Add dynamic id support to all USB drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here's two patches against the latest -git tree that add the ability to
add new vendor/product device id pairs to USB drivers after they have
been loaded.  It works just like the PCI drivers do, with the exception
that only vendor/product can be specified (no class stuff.)  I did it
this way to make it simpler, as that's almost all anyone ever wants to
add.
Note that usb-serial drivers do not work properly with these dynamic ids
yet, it's going to take some rework of the usb-serial core due to the
wierd way it binds drivers to devices to get this to work properly.
Comments?
thanks,
greg k-h
