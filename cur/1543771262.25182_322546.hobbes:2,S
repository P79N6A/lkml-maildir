Agreed, it is deadlock (as I said), but it is where your
code can go to infinite recursion if you don't have the safeguards
in. 
Calling it a bug depends on what are the "standards" of your code.
Some people consider it good enough and just expect that if you
get an -EDEADLK it means you have already locked the structure and
can go into the atomic section. 
Not that I agree, but the point is YMMV depending on who is using it
and for how.

Well, this is normal priority propagation to a not-trivial
ownership-wait chain. Or PI transitivity (I think I've heard
it called like this).

It can be done iteratively in all cases (at least the fusyn code
does).

No if you stack the priorities (again, look at the fusyn code,
or better at the OLS paper, don't have time to give the full
rundown again). Then it becomes a very simple matter of popping 
the first item in your priority stack.
