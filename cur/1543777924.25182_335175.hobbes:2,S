But you can never tell where these are in general.

I don't see why or how this can be true in general (it might be, but I
don't see how myself).  If we are half way through scanning a
directory and people start messing with it we could end up somewhere
bogus (in which case f_op->readdir I guess is expected to try and do
something sane here?)

For that to be the case where is the state kept to ensure your current
offset is valid?
