You need a centrifuge or something that works like one. You can
make one and you can calibrate it using simple techniques. For
instance, you can swing the mass (laptop) over your head, round
and round with your arm. If the rate is such that the mass "just"
falls over the top, the 'G's at that point are zero. At the
bottom of the swing, the 'G's will be maximum. If you used a
fish-scale (spring-scale) to swing the whole thing, you could
measure its static weight, then observe the apparent weight
everywhere along the swing arc. If you don't have to go through
0 Gs, you can just swing the whole thing around horizontally
and observe the fish-scale. The 'G' load is exactly the indicated
weight / static weight.
As a relative measure, a 5.5 lb weight, swung through a 5ft
diameter, (2.5 ft radius) arc at such a speed that it "just"
falls through the top, exerts about 4 Gs (22 lb) at the bottom.
Don't accidentally hit something. Impact Gs may make your
experiment expensive.
