I have noticed that the shutdown path is quite weird, shutting down
sysdev devices differently depending on the type of shutdown, which is
probably not good.
But what change are you talking about for the poweroff problem?  I have
a _lot_ of people reporting that 2.6.22 is not powering off for them and
I can't seem to figure it out.  Do you have a changeset for something
that went in to fix this issue?
