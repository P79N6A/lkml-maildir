In 3.3 this style is not accepted (haven't read the c99 draft to see if it is
OK)
struct foo {
	struct bar {
		int a, b;
	};
}
But this one is:
struct foo {
	struct /* bar */ {
		int a, b;
	}
}
Does anybody knows if gcc 3.3 behaviour is correct and the fact that gcc 3.2
accepts the former style was just a temporary bug?
