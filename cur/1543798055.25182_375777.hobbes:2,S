Hey, cool ... glad to see that's ready now!
I'll have to give it a try when I have a spare moment.
Is there a writeup on how to hook this up with the key retention
infrastructure?  I know many folk are unfamiliar with that, and
I seem to recall a need for some userspace tweaks.  (Like SHA1
hashing of passphrases to generate MMC keys, and maybe storing
keys in some per-user file using some user interface.)
