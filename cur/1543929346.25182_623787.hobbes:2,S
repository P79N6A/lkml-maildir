As a kernel developer let me say thank you for doing what testing you can.
I think a bit of tolerance for others can help the conversation.  At the
same time since out of tree modules (even GPL'd ones) have not chosen
to play with us we have to move forward as best we can without their
input.  It isn't possible to do anything else.
Right now I have made some changes for good technical reasons, and
some out of tree modules have broken.  Regardless of the flavor of
EXPORT_SYMBOL they would have broken.
Based on my experience with in-tree code and the few glimpses I
have gotten of out of tree code the reason the out of tree code broke
is because it is doing very questionable things.
So the best I can say at this point, is my apologies that we have not
served you better and made it possible to do what you need to do
without relying on code of questionable character.  Hopefully this
situation will be better in the future.
