The Posix.1 spec is quite specific on what uname(2) must return:
sysname (name of the inmplementation of the OS, i.e., Linux), nodename 
(same as hostname), release, version and machine-hardware-type.
The uname(1) command specifies -[amnsrv]
but I can see no reason why additional information can't be added.
For one thing, `version' of a release could contain the compiler ID
(POsix doesn't specify what goes into that string); or a new interface 
(via sysconf maybe) could be added to get the information, and a new
option to uname to print it out.
