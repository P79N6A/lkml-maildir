Ok, this is a very minor window compared to the current one, but yes, that
could happen too in test4.

It only gets the strictly necessary number of wakeups.

.. and then set it after checking if a new request is available, just
before schedule(). That would avoid the above race (and the one
I mentioned in previous email) but it doesn't address the lost wakeups
for example when setting USE_RW_WAIT_QUEUE_SPINLOCK to 1.
Considering wakeups only the ones that moves the task to the runqueue will get
rid of the races all together and it looks right conceptually so I prefer it.
