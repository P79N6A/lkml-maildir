Thank you. It seems the only difference with mine reiserfs is about
the 'noatime' - which I tried and saw no difference.
Or will the system or fs size/age make any difference? If you happen
to have a spare/swap partition, could you make a new reiserfs and
mount it and copy several less-than-4KB files into it and wait for 30s
and see what happen to pdflush?
btw, what's the exact kernel version you are running?
Thank you,
Fengguang
