No, it won't do. Imagine that I'm not able to modify the kernel with its 
drivers. It should work with usual kernel and HID driver. So I want my 
driver to ask the HID driver to free the interfaces or don't claim them 
at all. Mb there's an example of such a driver?.. obviously there are a 
lot of HID devices and mb a vendor one of them doesn't want to use HID 
driver for one of its interfaces to provide some additional features or 
something, so he should make the kernel use his driver instead of HID...
Does it make any sense?)
