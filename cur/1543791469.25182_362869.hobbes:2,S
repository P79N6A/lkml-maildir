Subject: [PATCH] i386 LVT entries remaining unmasked on reboot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Excerpt from bugzilla entry
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5518
"i386 version of Reboot-through-BIOS is unsafe: it forgets to mask
APIC LVT interrupts before jumping to a BIOS entry point. As a result,
BIOS ends up bombarded with interrupts early on boot. The BIOS does
not expect it since following a "normal" hardware cpu reset, all APIC
LVT registers have the Mask bit (16) set and can't generate interrupts.
For example, the version of Phoenix BIOS used by VMware enables interrupts
for the first time before masking/clearing APIC LVT. The APIC Timer LVT
register is still set up for a timer interrupt delivery with a high 
vector from the previous Linux incarnation (0xef in our case). The BIOS
has not fully initialized its IDT at this point and the real mode gate for
0xef remains all zeros. Vector 0xef dispatches BIOS to address 0:0, BIOS
takes a #GP and eventually hangs.
machine_shutdown() does attempt to shut down APIC before jumping to
BIOS, but it is ineffective"
