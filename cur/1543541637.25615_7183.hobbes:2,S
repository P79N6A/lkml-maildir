netatalk needs a layout that is also fakable on normal storage so that as
with current setups you can mount mac stuff off hfs, off ext2 (resources really
are just directories) and over NFS (resources could be either). 
The mount hack would be ugly for this, and hideous for backup tools. So it
seems to fail the cleanness test, the backup test and the consistency test
