Yes. 
So if you want to fix synchronize_irq(), maybe the proper change would
have been just something really simple like
	/* Disabled? Nothing to synchronize.. */
	if (irq->status & IRQ_DISABLED)
		return;
	if (irq->status & IRQ_INPROGRESS)
		wait_for_irq_to_finish()
instead of messing with the IRQ_INPROGRESS logic that is used by the IRQ
probing logic.
Did you even notice and/or verify that your changes may have broken IRQ
probing, which depends on the INPROGRESS behaviour?

Right. I believe you. I can see your _first_ patch making sense.
I cannot see the second patch being all that worthwhile, while possibly
breaking autodetection and certainly modifying behaviour without any real
reason to.
Notice how my answer was to your _second_ patch, which I think is just
completely broken.
