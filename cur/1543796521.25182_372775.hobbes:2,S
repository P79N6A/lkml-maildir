Hi,
 I have a question. In the vma_memory_address struct, there are 2
fields "vm_start" and "vm_end". I was wondering, does the process
address space include all addresses between those 2 addresses? or
could there be holes inside this range?
The main reason I am asking is because I tried to call __follow_page()
on some of those addresses and got NULL as a result. I am not sure if
this is a hole, or just a problem with my code!
Thanks a lot in advance
