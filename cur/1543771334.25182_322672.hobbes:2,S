Just a few more thoughts on this....
I can't help but wonder if a similar problem exists even without HT. 
What if the load-balancer decides to keep a sched_normal task on a cpu
that is being dominated by a sched_fifo task.  The sched_normal task
should really be "balanced" to a different cpu but because nr_running is
the only balancing criteria that may not happen.  Runqueue business
ought to be weighted by the amount of time that sched_fifo tasks on that
runqueue have recently used.  So, load = rq->nr_running +
rq->recent_fifo_run_time.  I think this would make load-balancing more
correct.
Now back to HT sched_domains...  It seems to me that when
SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER is on, recent_fifo_run_time should apply to the whole
domain instead of a single runqueue, so that a cpu's load =
rq->nr_running + sd->recent_fifo_run_time.  But I don't know if this
suffers from the same runqueue locking problem that you pointed out.
