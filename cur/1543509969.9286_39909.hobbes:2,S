I think the biggest confusion comes from the fact that ip-adresses are not
bound to interfaces, but to the host.
When I assign an ip to i.e. dummy0 (and interface is up), I would expect
it to work from inside this host, but not from the outside, as I
would expect an address on eth0 not to be reachable on eth1 unless I use
ip_forward==1 .
After painfull hours of debugging I now think I know how it works (or not
works in my setup here), but for me it's a bug (some may call it a ugly
feature).
