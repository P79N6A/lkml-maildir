This failed the Vaio test.  I guess it triggered a USB bug.
With this patch applied, when I hotplug my wireless mouse, the little LED
on the mouse comes on for a second or so then goes out and no pointy clicky
for me.
It says:
[  152.481522] usb 1-1: new low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
Without this patch applied, I get
[  195.935445] usb 2-1: new low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
[  196.116183] usb 2-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
[  196.198362] input: Microsoft Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 1.00 as /class/input/input7
[  196.223724] input: USB HID v1.11 Mouse [Microsoft Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 1.00] on usb-0000:00:1d.1-1
[  196.224570] usb 2-1: new device found, idVendor=045e, idProduct=00e1
[  196.224579] usb 2-1: new device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[  196.224585] usb 2-1: Product: Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 1.00
[  196.224590] usb 2-1: Manufacturer: Microsoft
and lots of pointy clickiness.
I would assume that there is some msleep() in USB which is too short, and
the present wild rounding-up which msleep() does covered up the
incorrectly-chosen sleep duration.
I'm using HZ=250 (
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/config-sony.txt
) and it
could well be that the mouse would fail just by going to HZ=1000, but I
didn't bother testing that.
Could one of the USB developers please suggest which msleep()(s) I should
start looking at?
Thanks.
