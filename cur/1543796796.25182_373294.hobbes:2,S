Linus made a pragmatic technical decision for the benefit of a bunch of 
Linux users, a decision I support despite the fact that NVIDIA are a 
bunch of sillyheads.
Realistically, no position was weakened, nothing new happened.
In the context of the larger thread, the doomsday scenario is highly 
unlikely because of positive engineering attributes of open source. 
Smart companies want open source drivers not because people snipe at 
them verbally and legally, but because the process produces superior 
engineering in the end.
