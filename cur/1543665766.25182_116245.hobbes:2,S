7400 and 7410 core versions are identical, afaik.  I don't
think any 7410 core lower than version 2.0 was ever used
in any consumer machines.  ymmv.

Between 7400 and 7410?  That's news to me...

That would be a problem, yes :-(

As long as its rare, that's not _too_ big of a problem,
really.  Just document it ;)

Bad idea, I think.

I'd go for this option.
