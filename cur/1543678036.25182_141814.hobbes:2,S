Looks good to me.
migration_thread and try_to_wake_up already have a simplier version of
your test that seems to be correct for that environment, so no change
is needed there.
wake_up_forked_process in principle might need your patch, but as it
appears to be called only from boot code it is unimportant that it
have the lowest possible latency, so no change is needed there either.
