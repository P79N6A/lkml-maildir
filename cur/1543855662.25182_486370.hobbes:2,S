We shut down the filesystem because we cancelled a dirty transaction.
Once we start to dirty the incore objects, we can't roll back to
an unchanged state if a subsequent fatal error occurs during the
transaction and we have to abort it.
If I understand historic occurrences of this correctly, there is
a possibility that it can be triggered in ENOMEM situations. Was your
machine running out of memoy when this occurred?

EIO gets returned in certain locations once the filesystem has
been shutdown.

Yeah, the above error report typically is due to an in-memory
problem, not an on disk issue.

Can happen to XFS on any kernel version - got a report of this from
someone running a 2.4 kernel a couple of weeks ago....
Cheers,
