As I see it, there are two possibilities here, that the game server is
being run on a dedicated server hardware, or at least with the blessing of
the root user. In that case root can adjust nice appropriately. The other
possibility is that root is counting on the scheduler to protect the other
processes in the system from being starved. In that case it's working
nicely.

Yes, and it works really well! Job mixes which used to result in poor
response now work just fine, nice actually does something, and behaviour
of processes which are intended to get resources can be given negative
nice (nasty?) to make them run well.

Seems to defeat all the wonderful work which went into this. On any shared
system there will be people who know how to trick the scheduler into
running their jobs faster. Used to do that myself when machine were really
slow ;-) Actually if I understand the way the scheduler works, and I think
I do at the high level, if this server was a well-behaved threaded app
individual threads would show as interactive, they could have various
priority depending on the behaviour of the threads, and things would run
pretty well. If that server is doing a huge select or poll of 300 users I
bet all the CPU is in the system call anyway.

And I suspect that if users can push their own jobs, they will. I really
don't think the scheduler is doing the wrong thing, and there is a well
defined way to make the process have higher priority.
This isn't a kernel issue, it's an administration issue.
