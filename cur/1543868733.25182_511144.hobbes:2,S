There is no way to constrain the amount of slab work. In order to make the 
above work we would have to disable the per cpu caches for a certain cpu. 
Then there would be no need to run the cache reaper at all.
To some extend such functionality already exists. F.e. kmalloc_node() 
already bypasses the per cpu caches (most of the time).  kmalloc_node will 
have to take a spinlock on a shared cacheline on each invocation. kmalloc 
does only touch per cpu data during regular operations. Thus kmalloc() is much 
faster than kmalloc_node() and the cachelines for kmalloc() can be kept in 
the per cpu cache.
If we could disable all per cpu caches for certain cpus then you could 
make this work. All slab OS interference would be off the processor.
