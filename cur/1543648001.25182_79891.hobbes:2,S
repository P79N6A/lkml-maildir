(lots of gcc internal structure dump deleted here)
Yes it's a GCC optimiser bug.  I'm surprised I didn't see it: I tried
a whole heap of different compilers on that code, and had problems
only on the earlier similar code in raid0_run().
I didn't try redhat's compilers (I run debian) but didn't expect the
behaviour to be that different.
Anyway, please apply this patch (which also fixes the chunk overlap
problems).
