I had this same question myself.  I added a bottom half to a (proprietary)
protocol-accelerator driver for 2.0 using tq_immediate.

Currently, I just allocate a new struct GFP_ATOMIC in the ISR.  But I was
worried about performance as well.  I already did a free-list for another
structure in the driver, so I think I will do the same for the task
struct.  You may wish to build a list of the linked structures at
init_module time, and have "checkout/checkin" functions that use them off
the top.  I wrote two very small, inline functions (with locking to protect
the queue access) that checkout an item or return one to the list.  You can
also implement dynamic growing of the list such that if the list is ever
exhausted, you add another X elements.  I think pruning is a little more
challenging.
Good luck,
