Hi all,
I get the following message:
 tts/0: 1 input overrun(s)
each time while downloading pictures from my digital camera via ttyS0,
_and_ switching between an X session and textmode console.
(ie, 1 switch -> 1 error)
This is with 2.4.1. I don't remember getting these with 2.2
This error also means a transmit error (gphoto reports error and a packet
has to be retransferred.)
What is this? Why I'm getting it? What should I do? :)
bye,
Balazs Pozsar.
