Hans, it would probably be preferrable to get ext2-like behaviour where
action is configurable (see below), I personally would be annoyed if my
workstation rebooted if there is a read error from the disk.
Better to mark filesystem read-only on error and continue to allow
users to read from rest of filesystem than to just reboot the node.
That is my experience in any case.  For those systems where there is
e.g. an HA server with dual-channel disk it might be better to reboot
and failover to another server, but even that isn't clear as a real
media error will just cause both nodes to reboot endlessly instead of
providing the best service they can.

Actually, 1b is just the default behaviour for ext3 (because of journal
errors).  It is also possible to mount the filesystem with error=panic,
which will implement 1a, and it is also possible to mount ext2 with
error=remount-ro (which is default on Debian for ext2) which implements
1b.  I don't think it is possible to get 1c behaviour for journal
errors on ext3.

What is "unified error"?  Does this mean "-EIO" for all cases?  I also
don't understand why this is so important to your application...  If
you get an error back from the filesystem that isn't expected, that is
generally a problem regardless of what the error is...

This doesn't make sense.  If the "real cause of failure" is that the
journal code detected an inconsistency (it might not be an IO error at
the time, just some structure that is not what it should be, maybe the
user tried to format their partition while in use ;-) then the real
error is that the journal turned the filesystem read-only.  In any case,
you can't expect to get more information that "EIO", regardless of the
root cause (e.g. ENOMEM causes async buffer read to not complete, caller
checks buffer_uptodate() and it isn't uptodate, returns EIO).
Cheers, Andreas
