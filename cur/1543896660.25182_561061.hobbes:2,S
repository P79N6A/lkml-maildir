Are you going to release 2.6.22 with this bugs?? But question wasn't
on this subject ...
The question was "why linux kernel release should have some bugs that
would be fixed fixed in future?"
Let's wait and publish kernel w/o known bugs. Let's wait for some
time, let's publish 2.6.22-rc_last, test it for some time(2 weeks for
example), fix bugs if any and after _test_period_of_whole_kernel_ but
not _separate_patches/parts_ of kernel release stable one!
