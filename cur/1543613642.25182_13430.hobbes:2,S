Salut,
I sum up the different thread about i810_audio
(i'm only a user testing this driver)
Doug Ledford : release 0.11 in his site
(
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/i810_audio.c.gz
)
don't work : cat /vmlinuz > /dev/dsp freezes the kernel,
no sound played
No possibility to Alt-SysRq
Nathan Bryant : patch for 0.11
not tested
Andris Pavenis : other patch for 0.11 (seems to be better)
not tested
Doug Ledford : patch for 0.11, 0.11 becomes 0.12
don't work, see 0.11
Andris Pavenis : patch for 0.12, 0.12 becomes 0.12a
don't work, see 0.11, one difference : sound played
and then freeze.
My system
---------
Kernel : 2.4.16
Debian unstable
