so you don't mind if a couple of us go around adding say 10 lines
of code to files you authored, and then put our copyrights under
your name?  good!  i am glad to hear that.  a bit of additional
"undeserved credit" is always welcome anyway.
would look good in my cv.
it is not just a bit of undeserved credit.  the (c) owners will
be asked in the future regarding any legal aspects of the files
they hold copyrights to.  i don't think those 2 gentlemen have
earned that yet.
