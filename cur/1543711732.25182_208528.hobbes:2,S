When I needed to do stuff like this, I went back to the vmlinux
(uncompressed) which was lying around in the build directory. Or even to
the individual .o files.

Placing it into a file and objdump(1) should give most of what you are
after... and you might also start gdb(1) on the file. Dunno if the weird
startup code/placement messes it up, but worth a try.

May I ask what you were after?
