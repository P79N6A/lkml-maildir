With kernels 2.2.9 and 2.2.10, I get a wierd problem the FIRST time
that I compile after unpacking them, and ONLY if I compile with egcs,
gcc doesn't do it. However, the SECOND and subsequent compiles are
fine, and the problem is not present with 2.2.8 and earlier.
If somebody can tell me why egcs with 2.2.9 or 2.2.10 thinks that
time.h doesn't exist, I for one would love to know.
My compiling system is an AMD K6-2/350 with 128M of RAM and running RH
6.0, if that's relevant.
Best wishes from Riley.
