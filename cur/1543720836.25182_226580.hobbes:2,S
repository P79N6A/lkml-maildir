Yikes!
With the 4:4 VM split it definately is instantaneous with > 1GB of memory, I
triggered it with 1.25G myself and never noticed anything wrong with just
1GB (allocation starts from the top it seems). With the standard 1:3 split I
don't think anything > 1GB ever gets used for skbuffs, but maybe there
are circumstances where this can happen? 
(Or the issue isn't fully understood yet, figuring out what breaks and what
doesn't was basically just trial and error :-/ )
