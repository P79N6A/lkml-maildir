No, you introduced a regression. This isn't the SCSI layer being evil, 
this is the "regressions aren't acceptable".
Fixing one bug and introducing another is actively _worse_ than having the 
same bug stay around.

That's certainly the logical fix - push the pain up the chain to the 
person who introduced it. Which commit is that, do you know?
Really, the added ref-count should be gotten by whoever holds on to the 
thing, and it sounds like it's the hotplug event that caused this and 
should have held on to its hotplug reference.
Greg added to the Cc: list in case he already knows off-hand which commit 
it is..
