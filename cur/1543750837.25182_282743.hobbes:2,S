More importantly, what has a defined meaning for one filesystem and is
interpreted and generated on demand by the kernel is irrelevant or
unsupported on other filesystems.
So, yes, you can't just copy a bunch of files from vfat to ext3 and
preserve the vfat attributes, but you should be able to stuff a bunch of
vfat files into a tar file and then restore them to a vfat filesystem
with all their original attributes intact.

Yes.

ASCII strings require no special tools to manipulate from shell scripts
(or even for the end user to interpret).
