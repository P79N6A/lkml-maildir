I have been doing some experimenting with the Voodoo4 on my Mac, and I have 
made a little progress. By doing register dumps and general snooping about to 
discover how MacOS sets up the card, I've found that the card actually 
supports a big-endian aperture on the framebuffer (this is different from how 
big-endian support works on the Voodoo3). As I don't have docs, there's a lot 
of guess-work involved, and I haven't got it working 100% reliably yet - but 
once I do I'll supply a patch.
I'm also working on getting the hwcursor working. The patch I produced against 
2.4.21 does contain fixes for the hwcursor on the Voodoo3 for big-endian 
machines. Again, though, because the different way byte-swizzling works on 
the Voodoo4/5, it doesn't work there in 16- and 32-bit modes. When I get the 
big-endian fixes for the Voodoo4/5 finished, I'll have look at the hwcursor 
on 2.5/2.6 . . . 
Cheers,
Rich
