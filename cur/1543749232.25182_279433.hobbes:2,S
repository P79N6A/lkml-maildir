I think the change in Documentation/CodingStyle is useful, even though I
don't really like changing all the existing code without going through
the respective maintainers.

This is basically the same category as the first three chapters of
CodingStyle. It's not nice to read, but there is no real problem in the 
code. Think of these issues as whitespace fixes: you are making the job
harder for code maintainers for very little gain. I would suggest that
you submit these patches only to the code maintainers, not to the Trivial
Patch Monkey or Andrew.
Or even better, change scripts/Lindent to do the change automatically for
code that it is used on, if that can be done in a reliable way.
