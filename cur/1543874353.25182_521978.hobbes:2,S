Linus, you're unfair with Con. He initially was on this position, and lately
worked with Mike by proposing changes to try to improve his X responsiveness.
But he's ill right now and cannot touch the keyboard, so only his supporters
speak for him, and as you know, speech is not code and does not fix problems.
Leave him a week or so to relieve and let's see what he can propose. Hopefully
a week away from the keyboard will help him think with a more general approach.
Also, Mike has already modified the code a bit to get better experience.
Also, while I don't agree with starting to renice X to get something usable,
it seems real that there's something funny on Mike's system which makes it
behave particularly strangely when combined with RSDL, because other people
in comparable tests (including me) have found X perfectly smooth even with
loads in the tens or even hundreds. I really suspect that we will find a bug
in RSDL which triggers the problem and that this fix will help discover
another problem on Mike's hardware which was not triggered by mainline.
Regards,
Willy
