is the mouse jerky on the console (using the mouse via GPM)?
i ask because i wager the bug is not a kernel bug but perhaps something
wrong with your X server/configuration.  i dont think there is any known
problem with the RedHat kernel, which is fairly well tested.  is there
an update for it?  since this may not be a kernel bug, you may find
better help in a RedHat or similar forum.
you could always compile your own kernel and see if that alleviates the
problem :)
