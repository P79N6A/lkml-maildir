Subject: [PATCH 03/14] uml: correct removal of pte_mkexec
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/5/374

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Correct commit 5906e4171ad61ce68de95e51b773146707671f80 - this makes more sense:
we turn pte_mkexec + pte_wrprotect to pte_mkread. However, due to a bug in
pte_mkread, it does the exact same thing as pte_mkwrite, so this patch improves
the code but does not change anything in practice. The pte_mkread bug is fixed
separately, as it may have big impact.
