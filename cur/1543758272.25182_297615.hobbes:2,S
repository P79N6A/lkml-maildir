Ok. Is that a "it has done so for the last 5 years" thing?

Agreed. At the same time, I could well imagine that some people might use 
such a type exactly to make DOS ignore it (but I assume the same is true 
of the regular 0x83 type too, so maybe I'm just being difficult).
There's certainly a good argument for fixing a known problem (Uwe) and a 
small enough risk of it breaking anything else.
