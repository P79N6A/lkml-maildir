    As far as I can tell, your insistance on everybody using the term
    "GNU/Linux" is because YOU want to enslave all of us into YOUR
    organisation.
I ask people to use the term "GNU/Linux", in order to help inform
other people about the history of the operating system in question.
Many people think that the development of the system as a whole
started in 1991, when Linux was written.  Actually it was started in
1984 by the GNU project.
If you talk with the people who use the term "GNU/Linux", you'll find
that I actually have no power over them; I can't force them to do
anything.  I wouldn't want to, even if I could.  I can only point out
the facts, and ask people to act accordingly.  Then they make their
own decisions.
