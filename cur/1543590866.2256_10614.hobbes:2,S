You don't have to set the command line anyway. At least you _didn't_.

It's a PITA. Downloading a kernel by TFTP each time you make a one-line 
change is painful enough, without having to download a ramdisk to go with 
it.
And once those kernels are being built with CONFIG_BLK_DEV=n, the ramdisk 
is going to be an even more unattractive solution.
