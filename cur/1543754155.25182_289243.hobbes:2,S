i didnt declare victory - the full range of latency fixes is in the -RT
tree. Merging of relevant bits is an ongoing process - in 2.6.10 you've
already seen some early results, but it's by no means complete. Nor did
i declare that nice--20 was suitable for audio priorities.

why? You could use e.g. nice -20, -19 and -18. (see the patch below that
implements this.)

this is not a prototype, it's an 'API hack'. The real solution would
have none of these limitations of course. Just think of this patch as an
'easy way to use nice--20 without any jackd changes' - any API
limitation you sense is a fault of this hack, not a fault of the
concept.
Find below an updated version of the 'API hack', which, instead of
auto-mapping all RT priorities, extends sched_setscheduler() to allow
nonzero sched_priority values for SCHED_OTHER, which are interpreted as
nice values. E.g. to set a thread to nice--20, do this:
	struct sched_param param = { sched_priority: -19 };
	sched_setscheduler(pid, SCHED_OTHER, &param);
(obviously this is not complete because no permission checking is done,
but this could be combined with an rlimits solution to achieve safety.)

sorry, but that is not how the discussion started. The discussion
started about an API hack, the RT-LSM way to give ordinary users the
unfettered access to RT scheduling.
Then, after this approach was vetoed (rightfully IMO, because it has a
number of disadvantages), did the real discussion start: "how do we give
low latencies to audio applications (and other, soft-RT alike
applications), while not allowing them to lock up the system."
I happened to start that angle - until that point everyone was focused
on the wrong premise of 'how do we give RT privileges to ordinary
users'. We _dont_ give raw RT scheduling to ordinary users, period. The
discussion is still about how to give (audio) applications low
priorities, for which there are a number of solutions:
- SCHED_ISO is a possibility, and has nonzero costs to the scheduler.
- CKRM is another possibility, and has nonzero costs as well, but solves
  a wider range of problems.
- negative nice levels are the easiest shortterm solution and have zero
  cost. They have some disadvantages though.
I'm not 'against' SCHED_ISO at all:

i think the real situation is somewhat the opposite: we much more often
broke RT scheduling than SCHED_NORMAL scheduling. RT scheduling is
rarely used, while SCHED_NORMAL (and negative/positive nice levels) are
used much more often than e.g. SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR.

this is not really a problem - there are other kernel subsystems that
start RT-priority kernel threads. We could easily move such threads to
the common nice -10 priority level or so.
