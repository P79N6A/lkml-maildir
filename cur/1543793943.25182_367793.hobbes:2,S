This?
I don't know if it'll be a problem.  One factor is that when the VFS is
doing an fsync() or whatever, it will fail to notice these left-over pages
are "dirty", so it won't launch writepage() against them.
But if they are marked PageWriteback(), sync will notice them on the second
pass and will wait upon them, which apparently could mean a stall until
pdflush kicks off the I/O?
If they're not marked PageDirty() or PageWriteback(), the VFS will miss
them altogether during the sync.  But perhaps NFS's own page tracking will
flush them and wait upon the result?

Ah, OK.   Things are improved.
