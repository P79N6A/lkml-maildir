This does not break the code at run time, this breaks the code at 
compile time, and should be less painful.

This breaks the code at run time and is the _real_ pain to think 
about. As for packing for network and hardware - not an issue at all. 
The difference between gcc and g++ is _only_ in empty structures.

I agree, it would be a bad idea to compile the existing C code by g++. 
  The good idea is to be able to produce new C++ modules etc.

You mentioned a bad example. The struct list_head has [almost?] all 
"members" inlined. If they were not, one could simply make a base 
class having [some] members outlined, and which class does not enforce 
type safety and is for inheritance only. The template class would then 
inherit the base one enforcing type safety by having inline members. 
This technique is well known, trust me. If you need real life 
examples, tell me.

For modules there are #defines module_init() and module_exit(). These 
are the natural places for the constructors and destructors.
For #defines core_initcall() ... late_initcall() I would type 
something like this:
	class foo_t { foo_t(); ~foo_t(); }
	static char foo_storage[sizeof(foo_t)];
	static foo_t& foo=*reinterpret_cast<foo_t*>(foo_storage);
	static void __init foo_init() { new(foo_storage) foo_t; }
	core_initcall(foo_init);
This ugly-looking code can be nicely wrapped into a template, which, 
depending on the type (foo_t in this case), at compile time, picks the 
proper stage for initialization.
