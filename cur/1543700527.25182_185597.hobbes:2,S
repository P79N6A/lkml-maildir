Hi there,
I'm successfully using a "Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21041
[Tulip Pass 3] (rev 11)" with the de4x5 driver under 2.4.23.
Using the same driver the system does however lock up within
milliseconds after bringing up the network interface in 2.6.0.
The de2104x driver primarily seems to fail receiving packets, running
tcpdump I do only see arp-who-has packets beeing transmitted, after some
time I do also get a 'eth0: timeout expired stopping DMA, kernel bug at
drivers/net/tulip/de2104x.c:413!'
Regards
Tom
PS: I'm using a dual Celeron/Abit BP6
