Hi,
    I have some problem while booting inside linux,so
tried to boot in single user mode for some changes in
/etc/grub.conf.But iam not able to boot in single user
mode.It is giving error message as
 ds: no socket drivers loaded!
 VFS: Cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or 00:00
 Please append a correct "root=" boot option
 Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 00:00
 Please i need a solution to proceed my work as soon
as possible.
