Well, the point of kerneldoc comments is that they're reasily
extractable.  If you want to document the arch interface a pure
text document in Documentation/ might be a better choice.

The one I noticed quickly is the __ASSEMBLY__ removal from
asm-x86/kgdb.h.  I haven't looked at the serial bits because I don't
think I'm qualified to comment on those, but I'm also not seeing any
replies to any of his patches.  Especially the comments on the arch
interface seem like something that should be acted upon to me.
