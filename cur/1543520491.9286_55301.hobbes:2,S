I'm trying to set up a router between an ethernet and token-ring network. After I finally managed to get the PnP-cards configured I get some strange symptoms with the tr0 device. It seems to work because I can reach computers on the internet but it very slow. Some pings in my subnet show that I get about 50% packet loss in my subnet. Pinging the same host (a NT server) with a NT workstation shows 0% packet loss. But wait, it get's even stranger! A ping to the Novell 5 (still on the same subnet) server hat 100% packet loss. Pinging the Novell 5 server from the NT workstation again show nothing unusual. I get the same efects when I try to ping the Linux box from other computers. Some show about 50% packet loss, other show 100%.
I'm using a Cyrix 6x86MX on a board with the PXpro chipset and a IBM Auto 16/4 Token Ring ISA and a Compex NE-2000 clone.
Any hints, or solutions?
Regards
Martin
