Make the SLOB allocator mark its pages PG_slab, just like the SLAB allocator
does.  I think this should be okay as the SLOB allocator and the SLAB
allocator seem to be mutually exclusive.
Using PG_slab would also give an instant check to things like SLOB's kfree().

This is not a valid workaround as the object won't necessarily have been
allocated from a slab (shared ramfs mappings and SYSV SHM for example).  You
may not pass to ksize() objects allocated by means other than SLAB/SLOB.
