So you're saying that the EFI in the kernel now still won't support more
than 128 or so chunks of memory in the boottime memory map, because it
still goes via the legacy E820h memory map code?
I'll have to study the code more and give it a try.
Are you optimistic that some variation of H. Peter Anvin's "struct
setup_data" mechanism will make it into 2.6.25 or thereabouts?
