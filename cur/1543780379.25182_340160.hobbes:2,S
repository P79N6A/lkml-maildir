I explained this badly.
Inodes have access to an address_space via inode->i_data. This
address_space is used to allocate pages from functions like
page_cache_alloc() or grab_cache_page(). It is these pages that are the
problem, not the slab pages holding the inode structures. The question is
how these pages can be directly reclaimed. Does anyone have suggestions?
