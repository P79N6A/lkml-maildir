BTW, I don't know of anyone *doing* this, but IMHO it's not worth a
single line of kernel code, since if you don't adjust your futex
addresses when you mremap, the try_down_futex will segv after the poll
or whatever.  As a programmer, I would *expect* to have to reset the
futexes (along with every other pointer into the map) when mremap
happens: after all, I told the kernel to watch the old address.  If it
still works, great, but I'd not expect it.

Agreed.  You can get a page per 2 fds trivially anyway with pipes, so
staying within that bound is fairly safe.
Cheers!
