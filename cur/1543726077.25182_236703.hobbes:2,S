For the record... with a huge amount of assistance from Andi, and a lot
of trial and error, I tracked down the problem.  This is a symptom of
having USB Legacy Support turned on in the BIOS of a K8T Master2-FAR
(BIOS rev 1.2).
I turned it on because, without it, I couldn't talk to grub from my USB
keyboard.  If I hit a key on the keyboard at the grub prompt, before
Linux got going, then all was well.  If I let it try to autoboot,
however, the timer is scrogged.  Andi's guess was that the SMM (System
Management Mode) code in the BIOS is doing something nasty.
Without it I can't kick grub by hand, but I can autoboot.  I should
just go find another PS2 keyboard.
