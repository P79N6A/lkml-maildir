Got complaints from arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:
arch/i386/mm/discontig.c: In function `zone_sizes_init':
arch/i386/mm/discontig.c:422: warning: passing arg 4 of `free_area_init_node' makes integer from pointer without a cast

Looks like I can't get by with just deleting the third argument in the
second case.
