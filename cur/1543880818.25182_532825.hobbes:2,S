yes. we need something like :
-       while (!atomic_read(&s->killed)) {
+       while (1) {
                try_to_freeze();
 
                set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
 
+               if (atomic_read(&s->killed))
+                       break;
+
I have an old patch for this driver. I'll refresh it.
