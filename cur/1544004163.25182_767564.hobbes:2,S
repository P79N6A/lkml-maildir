And it does not work with single highmem page when NUMA is set... I
went through the highmem saving code, and it depends on highmem not
changing from  under it (right?) and is generally quite tricky ('if
they are both in highmem do this, else if one of them is do that, else
do something else') and it changes page protections on the fly, etc.
I'm not saying the bug is in that code, but before that commit we had
very stupid --- but very robust -- code. I'll try if that one works
with config_numa, perhaps we can get some debug info that way.
