reemit?  as in inject back to the kernel?  How does one prevent loops?
If one is able to in effect divert the event stream out of the kernel
and then back in to the normal evdev-> keyboard stream that would seem
a workable approach.

I was referring to being able to read the evdev data from the keyboard
while still allowing the vt to consume the data.  Can one filter out
just keys of interest,  or will reading the /dev/input/eventX prevent
the keys being fed to the vt and hence to /dev/ttyXX?
(Don't have source on this machine,  so can't easily check).

Yup that is - my program for remapping affects all VTs - and more to
the point - X11 as well.

Well using the pty is not too bad,  and some stuff seems unhappy unless
fed from a tty of some form (default line buffering for stdin/stdout,
job control with bash).
However,  having written a prog for some of the pty interaction,  it is
a lot larger that the diff you posted.
Anyway,  wouldn't this all be easier with a app running on X and
XKEYBOARD/XKB manipulations?  Have the key that does left/right
swapping simply be a group toggle action in the definition file.
