How about using current classes, but name them to have common prefix,
eg input_dev, input_interface etc class names - this way, if a program
wants to enumerare all input <whatever>, it enumerates /sys/class,
finds all directories matching input*, and looks inside...
Maybe not that elegant, but may work.
