I disagree...
We should fix the printk to be KERN_NOTIFY so that you can filter them,
but otherwise there is *no way* to know whether or not you have support
for the features you are attempting to use.
People might get somewhat confused if they try to enable strong
security, and the kernel happily mounts the partition with AUTH_SYS, and
does nothing to warn them...
Cheers,
