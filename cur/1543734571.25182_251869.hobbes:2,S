See arch/arm/configs/* for many configuration examples.  They are all 
separate ARM targets and usually a given config enables as much 
sensible options 
as possible for that target.  It seems to me that using
'make neponset_defconfig && make all' is a relatively good configuration 
to test toolchain regressions, at least for an ARMv4 build.
If you need, say, a minimal test configurations with the least selected 
options as possible, I don't think anyone would object including such a 
default config file.

Right.
