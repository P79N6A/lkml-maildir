So sparse lun scanning is working then - sounds like your missing luns
is a problem with your array configuration as the kernel is probing them
(if it is was creating the even ones) - means the qlogic driver must
not be able to see these luns. Not familiar with your array so can't
help any more - your array vendor would probably be the most help.
