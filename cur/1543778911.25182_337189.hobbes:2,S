die_nmi() returns to nmi_watchdog_tick(), nmi_watchdog_tick does the
reset and continues.  Patch below.

I was looking at unknown_nmi_panic_callback(), which also calls
die_nmi().
traps.c already has several notify_die() calls, nmi.c has none.  It is
cleaner to keep all the notification in traps.c, with this small change
to nmi.c to cope with die_nmi() returning.
