whoops, you're right, i didn't notice that.  duh.  i can resubmit that
patch with that part whacked out, or someone higher up the food chain
can do that.  either way works for me.  sorry about that.

that sounds reasonable but, as i've mentioned before, many of the
sizable cleanups i've submitted are produced by a simple script, which
is written to process *one* kind of cleanup.  if i tried to fix
everything else in the same area at the same time, *that* would
involve far more manual labour, not to mention that the patch would be
less well-defined, and the probability of a fatal typo would actually
increase.
it's also possible that the stuff that isn't getting fixed in *this*
cleanup will be done in a future submission.  like i said, it's a
tradeoff.  i'm certainly open to suggestions but there's not much
chance that, when i attack one issue, i'm then going to manually
inspect every line that was changed to see what *else* could be done
at the same time.
life's just too short for that.
