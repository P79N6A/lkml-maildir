I will when I get everything together. The hold up at the moment is that 
Martin has found a boot failure with the new slab allocator on ppc64 that 
I am unable to explain.
Strangely, the panic is in the page allocator. I have no means of 
testing since I do not have a ppc64 system available. Could you help me 
figure out what is going on?
