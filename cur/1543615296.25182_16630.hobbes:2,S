Show me a place in the kernel which is performance-critical where we
do strcpy(p, "string").  I can't think of one.  The stuff in prom.c

As I said in another email, if the gcc maintainers want to change gcc
so that pointer arithmetic can do anything other than an ordinary 2's
complement addition operation, then we will stop using gcc.
