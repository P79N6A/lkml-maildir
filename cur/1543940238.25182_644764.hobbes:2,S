Did some further thinking:  Yes, I have to guarantee that the pointer
which the lookup in the idr tree returned is valid.
But I don't have to shove device_unregister() into the idr_rwsem locked
section.  Instead, I can (and actually should) increment the device's
refcount when I stick the device pointer into the idr tree.  (And of
course I decrease the refcount again when I remove the pointer from the
idr tree.)
Will probably post another update tomorrow.
