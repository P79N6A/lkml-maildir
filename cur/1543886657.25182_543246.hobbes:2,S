You can turn off -W's undesirable bits.  For net/rxrpc/ and fs/afs/ at least,
adding:
	CFLAGS += -W -Wno-unused-parameter
to the Makefile generates no warnings.  Perhaps this should be added to the
master Makefile.
Adding -Wsign-compare finds some stuff that I will fix.  It also finds some
stuff in the main and the networking headers.  This is a really useful option
and found some tricky bugs in CacheFiles.  I would endorse adding this
generally too.
