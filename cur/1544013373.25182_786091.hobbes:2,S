It depends... if your 4-core is laid out with four cores sharing one
external cache, then it will terminate, if, say you had 4 cores with
each pair sharing a cache (so two external caches) then it would
continue as a daemon. (If you had 2 sockets with a processor in each
one, it would continue running as well no matter how many cores on
each.)
If you run irqbalance --debug, it will show you the topology it detects.
If you have multiple cache domains, and it is still exiting, then we
have a bug. :)
