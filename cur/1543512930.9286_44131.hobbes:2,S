Quick news story check reveals:
1) It is a chipset "feature".
2) The numbers are not random in the usual sense at all.  An array of 2^16
numbers (of unspecified size) is stored in the chipset & read out on demand.
The press release makes a great deal of the fact that these numbers
themselves are somehow "truly random".

Subject: PIII kernel support- hardware randomizer
I am currently using an overclocked Celeron 300 (now 450). The only real
interest I have in the PIII and above is the hardware random number
generator (using thermal noise). I have seen discussion of PIII kernel
patches, but not about the random number generator. Does support for
this exist or is it planned, and is there a repository for PIII patches?
IMHO, the hardware random generator might improve cryptography somewhat,
and is the only feature desirable to me that the Althon lacks (AFAIK,
anyway).
