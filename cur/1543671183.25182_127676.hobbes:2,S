Suppose I did want to print some wafers.
Suppose, also, that I had developed a method that didn't require a
$10M+ factory.
(Also suppose I had _very_ steady hands, no dandruff, and my garden
shed was big enough :)
I'm curious - how do I go about learning what I do and don't need
patent licenses for making chips, without spending an absurd sum on
legal fees?
