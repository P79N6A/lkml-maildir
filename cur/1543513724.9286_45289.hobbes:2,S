Useful information would also include the driver detection message,
giving whether the card is operating in shared memory or I/O mode,
the output of "cat /proc/net/dev" and any error/warnings reported
by the driver (use "dmesg").
If there is nothing obviously wrong in that then you may need to use
tcpdump to get a better look at what is happening during a slowdown.
Paul.
