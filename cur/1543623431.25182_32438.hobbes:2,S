Absolutely agreed.  I'll happily accept patches for this,
but unfortunately don't have the time to implement this
myself right now.
The reason the pagemap_lru_lock protects both the lru
lists and the pte_chain lists is that it was the easiest
way to get -rmap running on SMP and I had (and still have)
a pretty large TODO list of -rmap and unrelated things...

Rik
