Which I presume rather rules out automagic detection and workaround?
I take it you are refering to the Phoenix BIOS detection code in
arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c (ah yes, I see coments about QA ;-) and
subsequent call to apm_battery_horked()?
Is it "obvious" that I'm dealing with the same or similar kind of
bugginess here?
That being the case, any reason I can't/shouldn't put in a function
similar to apm_battery_horked(), and call/run it based on a config-time
variable?
FWIW, the machine claims "Phoenix NoteBIOS" dated 1994, and the poweroff
bit of APM appears to work just fine.
Thanks,
Neale.
