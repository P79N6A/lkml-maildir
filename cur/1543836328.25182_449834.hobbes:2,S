Yes, as I mentioned in mail to Christoph, I did it just to separate
kevent as much as possible (so I introduced ->get_block() based
approach). It can be safely moved into mpage code and used from more
clear callback like ->readpage().
Since this AIO code was decided to be postponed for a while, I'm not
updating it (just make sure that it compiles with new changes), since
overall design of AIO changes (if any) is not 100% completed.
