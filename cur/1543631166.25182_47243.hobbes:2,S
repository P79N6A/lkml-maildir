Sorry for the confusion, but both usb-uhci.c and uhci.c will be deleted
anyway :)
I am more interested in usb-uhci-hcd.c and uhci-hcd.c drivers, which both
showed up in 2.5.16.  Yes they are based on the previous usb-uhci.c and
uhci.c drivers respectivly, but they are a bit different (they use the
hcd core code which reduces the size of the driver.)
You also might want to check out uhci.c again in 2.4.19-pre.  It has had
a lot of previous bugs fixed and works _much_ better for me than before.
thanks,
