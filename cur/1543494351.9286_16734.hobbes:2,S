  no.. You misunderstand.
  
  In unix the kernel runs in process context.. 
that i knew. so a process can trap to kernel mode via a syscall on
cpu1 and hence the kernel runs on that cpu. i grok that.
  So the kernel ran on both cpus, but two copies of the kernel
  could not run at one (except when doing some trivial things). All
  the int's were processes by cpu0.
  
afaik, the scheduler is called by the timer interrupt, right? so if
the timer int is only delivered to cpu0, how can a scheduler hand
over control to a process to run on cpu1, when the scheduler can't
run on cpu1.
  
i'd be glad if you could fill me in on what i'm missing.
