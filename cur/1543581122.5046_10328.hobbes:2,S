Hi,
I am quite new to rawio and am experimenting with with its usage. My test
environment is Redhat 7.0, kernel version 2.2.16-22 having an external fibre
channel drive having 2 disks (/dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1)
All I am trying to do is to write and read to & from the disk using a raw
device. Externally I did a "raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/sdb1" and then I wrote a
small program to do the read/write. The program is:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int fd;
    char writeBuf[512];
    char readBuf[100];
    memset(readBuf, '\0', 100);
    memset(writeBuf, '\0', 100);
    memcpy(writeBuf, "This is a test", 14);
    printf("writeBuf = %s\n", writeBuf);
    fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("open");
        exit (1);
    }
    if ((lseek(fd, 0L, 0)) < 0){
        perror("lseek");
        exit (1);
    }
    if ((write(fd, writeBuf, 512)) < 0) {
        printf ("errno = %d\n", errno);
        perror("write");
        exit(1);
    }
    lseek(fd, 0L, 0);
    if ((read(fd, readBuf, 512)) < 0) {
        perror("read");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("The readbuf is %s\n", readBuf);
    return 0;
}
When I run this program as root, I get the error "write: Invalid argument".
It is basically returning errno = 22 which is EINVAL and as per the write
manpage means that fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for
writing.
Could someone guide me on where I am going wrong & how to use raw devices?
