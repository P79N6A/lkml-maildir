Have you looked at the last discussion involving thread pools in Linux?
BenH brought up the topic earlier this year, it is archived on
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-2008-discuss/2008-July/000213.html
So while it seems that there is clearly a use for such infrastructure,
my feeling is that it should not be part of dst, but rather live
in a location where it can be used by every subsystem.
Of course getting it there means another flame war^W^W discussion about what
the right interface should look like.
My personal feeling is that the interface should look a lot like
the existing work queues, to the point where you can easily convert
drivers between them, or even move all work queues over to thread pools.
