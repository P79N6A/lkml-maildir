And the hate mail is the only thing that will arrive.   The GPL doesn't 
really seem
to protect anyone since the copyright holders really can't do much with 
it.  I've
got a bunch of people using GPL code I've put out there in all sorts of 
commercial
products and Can't do anything to them for failing to return changes.  
They can always
say they didn't accept the license then convert the code into their own IP .
