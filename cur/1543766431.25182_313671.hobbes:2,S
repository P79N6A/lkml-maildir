Subject: [PATCH] fix include order in mthca_memfree.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

About commit fdca124a1bcc7e624f6b887c6f26153f40ee43ee ("missing
include in mthca"):
 - Out of curiousity, what arch and/or config requires <linux/mm.h>?
   I regularly cross-compile drivers/infiniband for i386, x86_64, ppc64,
   ia64, sparc64 and ppc, and I haven't needed <linux/mm.h> in mthca_memfree.c.
 - When making changes to drivers/infiniband, can you please cc the
   maintainers or at least a public mailing list?  As far as I can
   tell, the patch went directly to Linus with no public review, which
   doesn't seem appropriate, no matter how trivial the change.
 - When adding includes, please match the existing style and put
   <linux/xxx.h> includes before any local "yyy.h" includes.
Linus, please apply the patch below to move the include where it belongs.
Thanks,
  Roland
