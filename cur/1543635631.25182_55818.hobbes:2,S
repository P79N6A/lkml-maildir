Just to give some confirmation of the operation of this new driver.
I had had the same error messages as Matthew did. I followed
the instructions on Donald's site on making the new drivers and
it works great now. It found everything correctly with the following
output:

I am now sending this message over it.
Any idea when this will be merged into mainstream kernel?
Thanks,
