When allocating we do not have a problem as we simply pull a free page 
off the appropriately sizes free list.  Its when freeing we have an 
issue, all the allocator has to work with is the page you are freeing. 
As MAX_ORDER is >128K we can get to the situation where all but one page 
is free.  When we free that page we then need to merge this 128Kb page 
with its buddy if its free.   To tell if that one is free it has to look 
at the page* for it, so that page* must also exist for this check to work.

pfn_valid() will indeed say 'ok'.  But that is defined only to mean that 
it is safe to look at the page* for that page.  It says nothing else 
about the page itself.  Pages which are reserved never get freed into 
the allocator so they are not there to be allocated so we should not be 
refering to them.

There are tradeoffs here.  The smaller the section size the better the 
internal fragmentation will be.  However also the more of them there 
will be, the more space that will be used tracking them, the more 
cachelines touched with them.  Also as we have seen we can't have things 
in the allocator bigger than the section size.  This can constrain the 
lower bound on the section size.  Finally, on 32 bit systems the overall 
number of sections is bounded by the available space in the fields 
section of the page* flags field.
If your system has 256 1Gb sections and 1 128Kb section then it could 
well make sense to have a 1GB section size or perhaps a 256Mb section 
size as you are only wasting space in the last section.

I read that as saying there was a major gap to 3Gb and then it was 
contigious from there; but then I was guessing at the units :).
