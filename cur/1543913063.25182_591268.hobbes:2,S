You're welcome.

Good idea.

Hmmm, we'll have to discuss this among the unionfs developers first.

Which bug?  Is that something anyone submitted to our
https://bugzilla.filesystems.org
?  I don't recall such a bug in a while, so
if it got fixed, it must've been a while back.  If it's still there and
reproducible, please let me know asap so I can work on it.
It is possible that the bug is in the -mm code.  That's why we just posted
the long series of Unionfs patches: those patches represent more than four
months of intense hardening and testing.  Some of the bugs we've fixed had
to do with improper refcounting (esp. mnt refcounting, which, if not
perfect, either causes an EBUSY on unmount or an oops on unmount :-)
