Davide, Andrew, Linus, et al.
At the start of this thread
(
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/581115
 ), I proposed 4
alternatives to Davide's original timerfd API.  Based on the feedback in
that thread (and one or two earlier comments):
Let's dismiss option (a), since it is an unlovely multiplexing interface.
Option (b) seems a viable.  The most notable concern was from Thomas
Gleixner, that we might end up duplicating code from the POSIX timers API
within the timerfd API -- some eventual refactoring might mitigate this
problem.
Option (c) seems overly complex.  In addition, David Härdeman pointed out
that option (c) (and, I realised afterwards, option (d)) require the
userland programmer to maintain a mapping between timerfd file descriptors
and POSIX timer IDs.  Thomas Gleixner proposed an API that: attempts to
avoid that problem; mixes features of options (c) and (d); and probably
helps avoid redundancy of kernel code between the timerfd system and the
POSIX timers system.  I'll flesh out that API now as I understand it:
====> e) Integrate timerfd() with the POSIX timers API in such a way that
the POSIX timers API understands timerfd file descriptors.
Under the POSIX timers API, a new timer is created using:
int timer_create(clockid_t clockid, struct sigevent *evp,
        timer_t *timerid);
When making this call, we would specify evp.sigev_notify to a new flag
value SIGEV_TIMERFD, to inform the system that this timer will deliver
notification via a timerfd file descriptor.
We would then have a timerfd() call that returns a file descriptor
for the newly created 'timerid':
fd = timerfd(timer_t timerid);
(A variant here would be to have timer_create() directly return a file
descriptor when SIGEV_TIMERFD is specified, although this breaks the
traditional semantics that timer_create() only returns 0 on success.)
We could then use the POSIX timers API to operate on the timer
(start it / modify it / fetch timer value):
int timer_settime(timer_t timerid, int flags,
        const struct itimerspec *value,
        struct itimerspec *ovalue);
int timer_gettime(timer_t timerid, struct itimerspec *value);
The difference here is that 'timerid' could be either:
1) the timerid value returned from timer_create(); or
2) the value (fd | POSIX_TIMER_FD), where POSIX_TIMER_FD is a
   flag (perhaps the topmost bit set on) that indicates that
   the rest of the value is a file descriptor.  With this
   information, the kernel can do a lookup to find the
   corresponding timerfd and perform the required operation
   on it.
Advantages:
  1. Userland programs don't need to maintain a mapping between
     timer IDs and file descriptors.
  2. Adds just a single system call.
Disadvantages:
  1. This design stretches the POSIX timers API in strange
     ways.  My option (d) also did this to a lesser extent,
     and that felt slightly uncomfortable.  Option (e)
     makes more uncomfortable still.  As David Härdeman
     pointed out, overloading file descriptors with flags looks
     ugly, and I can't thing of any other syscall that does
     that.  In addition this idea probably breaks POSIX, since
     'timer_t' is only required to be an arithmetic type: it
     need not specifically be an integer type (although it is
     on Linux).
=====
The upshot is that of the 5 alternatives, I favor option (b).  David
Härdeman also expressed a preference for option (b) and it was Davide's
least disliked alternative ;-).
So I'm inclined to implement option (b), unless someone has strong
objections.  Davide, could I persuade you to help?
Cheers,
Michael
