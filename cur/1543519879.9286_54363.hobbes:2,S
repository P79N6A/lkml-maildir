I use the same setup here (IDE on SB). If I've configured the SB using
isapnp, the setup is stable between reboots until I boot DOS. So:
1. Configure the SB using isapnp.
2. Reboot Linux -> Linux directly. SB IDE should be still visible /
   configured.
3. I've noticed my SB uses the ide3's resources for it's (in my box)
third controller, so I have to put "ide2=0x168,0x36e,10 ide3=noprobe"
on the kernel command line
4. Don't boot DOS (or start from 1. again)
