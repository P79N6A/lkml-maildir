The Coverity checker spotted the following array overrun in 
drivers/ide/pci/cs5535.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static unsigned int cs5535_udma_timings[5] =
{ 0x7F7436A1, 0x7F733481, 0x7F723261, 0x7F713161, 0x7F703061 };
...
static void cs5535_set_speed(ide_drive_t *drive, u8 speed)
{
...
                if (speed >= XFER_UDMA_0 && speed <= XFER_UDMA_7)
                        reg |= cs5535_udma_timings[speed - XFER_UDMA_0];
...
<--  snip  -->
XFER_UDMA_7 - XFER_UDMA_0 = 7  >  (5 - 1)

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
