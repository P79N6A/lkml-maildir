ah yes, that - where the web server even for just static content was
providing the replies in more than one send. i would not consider that
to have been an "efficient" server.
i'm not sure that I agree with their statment that piggy-backing is
rarely successful in request/response situations.
the business about the last 1100ish bytes of a 4096 byte send being
delayed by nagle only implies that the stack's implementation of nagle
was broken and interpreting it on a per-segment rather than a per-send
basis. if the app sends 4096 bytes, then there should be no
nagle-induced delays on a connection with an MSS of 4096 or less.
it would seem that in the context of that paper at least, most if not
all of the problems were the result of bugs - either in the webserver
software, or the host TCP stack. otherwise, the persistent connections
would have worked just fine.

someone else sent a private email implying that no browsers were yet
doing pipelining.
