First of all, it's located in include/linux/cpufreq.h [to be accessible for
arch/i386/kernel/time.c, called cpufreq_scale() which should mean that it is
only meant for CPUFreq and nothing else.

IMHO per-arch functions are really not needed. The only architectures which
have CPUFreq drivers by now are ARM and i386. This will change, hopefully;
IMHO it should be enough to include some basic limit checking in 
cpufreq_scale().
