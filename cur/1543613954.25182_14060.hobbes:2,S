Am I alone in knowing that, at least as of 2.4.9 (the earliest I'm 
really sure I used it on) through 2.4.16, you DON'T need any weird 
boot-time switches?
Simply DO NOT compile in the IDE CD-ROM drive, compile in SCSI CD-ROM 
and SCSI Generic support, and voila, fully functional ATAPI CD writer
this even works on my IDE DVD drive
to read from em, I just use /dev/scd#
I am using NO boot time flags, including ide-scsi
