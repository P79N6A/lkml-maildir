It's certainly possible to implement most of the functionality of a
very simple processor this way, but applying the idea to an X86
compatible processor was a joke.
What interests me now is whether we could cache the results of certain
opcode strings in a separate memory area.
Say for example, you have a complicated routine that runs in to
hundreds of opcodes, which is being applied to large amounts of data,
word by word.  If one calculation doesn't depend on another, you could
cache the results, and then merely fetch them from the results cache
when the input data repeats itself.
I.E. the processor dynamically makes it's own look-up tables.
John.
