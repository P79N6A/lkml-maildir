I never saw traces showing the card should be resetted. It hung 
occasionnaly in the past but did not know who to really blame (USB vs 
drivers). It is now  working well for quite a long time now allthough I 
periodically transfers more than 100mb via ftp...

I'm not sure 2.6.9-rcx-mmx will provide valuable data, we will probably 
have to wait until distro incoporates this code to get some reasonnable 
hints... Do you have some well known driver users you could ping to get 
feedback more quickly?
Anyway, you are aware of the problem and I know how to fix my problem so 
all is fine.
Have a nice day,
