Yeah.

We need to be careful not to convert a temporarily-is-zero into
temporarily-is-uninitialised, but that looks to be OK.

The application is being a bit silly, because the read will return
indeterminate results depending on whether it gets there before or after
the write.  But that's assuming that the read is reading the part of the
page which the writer is writing.  If the reader is reading bytes 1000-1010
and the writer is writing bytes 990-1000 then the reader is being non-silly
and would be justifiably surprised to see zeroes.
I'd have thought that a sufficient fix would be to change
__copy_from_user_inatomic() to not do the zeroing, then review all users to
make sure that they cannot leak uninitialised memory.
