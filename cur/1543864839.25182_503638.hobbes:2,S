I have had that spike last up to about 4 seconds.  The pattern is that once
fsync starts taking time (e.g. there’s data to flush) the times will all be
in the milliseconds, except for one spike in the middle.  .  The times that
are in the milliseconds are all in a gradually increasing slope.
The stall I get from the real app is usually from a couple seconds to 25 or
so seconds.  
I’m not entirely sure that my test app demonstrates the same issue.

The app opens each file for write exactly once, except for log files, which
get written infrequently.  A file may be opened for read, but that’s
infrequent.  Files are either 1K long or more than 10M long, in roughly
equal numbers.  Each file is created/opened, written sequentially in one or
more chunks of from 100K to 10M (as data is received over a network),
fsync-ed, closed, and then renamed into its final name (same directory). The
entire sequence for an individual file takes place in one thread. The
directory containing the file is then fsynced.  (probably irrelevant – when
we open files for read we always read the entire file sequentially, then
close it, and we always call posix_fadvise(willneed)).
There are usually about 10-15 large files open for write at a time.

http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz,
  determine whether the offending files are highly fragmented.
I’ll get back to you on this today.
>> - Tell us how much dirty data is being written out by these fsyncs?
Each of these fsyncs is used to flush an entire new file that’s either 1K
long or larger than 10MB (but usually about 10MB).
>> - Try mounting the filesystem with `-o data=writeback'.  Probably won't
help much if it's also demonstrable on ext2.
I’ll try that…

the picture?
Using my test app I reproduced the behaviour on my home PC, which is a
pathetic little thing with an IDE drive.  I’ve also reproduced it in the
regular software using both hardware RAID and software RAID and will try
just a plain PATA drive later today.

Deadline does it too.  I'll try noop later today..
Thanks
