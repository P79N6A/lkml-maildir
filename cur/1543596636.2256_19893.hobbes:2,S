You can allocate a lot more memory for your pci activities.
No problem there.  Just drop the "GFP_DMA" and you'll get 
up to 1G or so.
You shouldn't use GFP_DMA because PCI cards don't need that.
Only ISA cards needs GFP_DMA because they can't use more
than 16M.  So obviously GFP_DMA is limited to
16M because it is really ISA_DMA.
PCI don't need such special tricks, so don't use GFP_DMA!
Your PCI cards is able to DMA into any memory, including
the non-GFP_DMA memory.

No matter what you do, DON'T change that.  Yeah, you'll get
a bigger GFP_DMA pool, but that'll break each and every 
ISA card that tries to allocate GFP_DMA memory.  You
achieve exactly the same effect for your PCI card by ditching
the GFP_DMA parameter, but then you achieve it without breaking
ISA cards.
