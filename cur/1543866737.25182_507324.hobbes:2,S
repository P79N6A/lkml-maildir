No where, I just compile the drivers,  see if my system boots up and
then I run some I/O intensive stuff, like bonnie++, emerge -e world at
the same time.

Not really, i dont focus on ext4dev, it just happens to be a partition
that's empty and has 40GB of space left for disk writes. I mostly use
XFS on my system.

I don't think there is a seperate libata, it's all put under libsata
if I understand the working correctly (Alan, don't sue me if I am
wrong).
Maybe it *IS* a nice idea to outline some standard tests that
developers want to have carried out or some specific tests to trace
bugs or test if a patch/fix does its work.. But that's not up to me, I
am not a coder, I can do some very basic stuff in C, that's where
programming ends for me, unless it's shell scripting.
