I started seeing the same problem on -rc4-mm1, and couldn't figure out why
I didn't see it on -rc3-mm3.  Finally figured out that it was because the
-rc3-mm3 had a -VP patch on it, and the -rc4-mm1 didn't (because of the
UP build problems in -T5).  Ingo's patch also reverts that patch, so I got
the fix 'free of charge'....
Ingo: Was that intentional, or it just happened?
