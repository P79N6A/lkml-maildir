this sounds like the few drivers that do this sort of thing (and this 
should only be the things that report status, drivers that enable devices 
should be taken care of) need a 'forget what you think you know, check the 
reality of the hardware' function.
even without suspend I've sen these drivers get out of sync with reality, 
and so such a function call would be useful to get them back in sync in 
any case.
if such a 'check reality' function was available it should be 
straightforward to call it after a non-ACPI hibrnate/resume
