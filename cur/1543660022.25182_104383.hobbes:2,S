Subject: [2.5] initrd/mkinitrd still not working
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Could someone *please* point me to the version of mkinitrd which works
with the new module code? The mkinitrd from Redhat and Slackware can not
find scsi modules which are in the module tree and modeles.dep. If I
build initrd by hand based on what worked for 2.5.47 it starts to load a
*still* can't find the module.
If this functionality is among the capabilities which were removed
during the module loading functionality downgrade, could someone just
say so?

Note: tried it in every kernel from 2.5.48-58, this is not just a 2.5.56
bug, I was just trying to get another feature working, without a root
filesystem it's not productive to test :-(

  Having the feature freeze for Linux 2.5 on Hallow'een is appropriate,
since using 2.5 kernels includes a lot of things jumping out of dark
corners to scare you.
