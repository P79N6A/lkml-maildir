So - based on your response and Alan Cox's it looks like the 'faulty'
addresses I thought I was seeing were indeed below the kernel memory
space... Unfortunately, too little sleep and too much time on the ARM
kernel (which sits much closer to the bottom of memory) made me only do
half a check...  Thanks to both of you for a quick response...
