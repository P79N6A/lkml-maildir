I'll believe that. The best explanation I've got is that it's a
Fujitsu drive. That'll teach me to buy pre-built boxes... the drive
will probably die in a month or so, and then I'll get to buy a new
one. Whee!

I wish it were that simple. hdc is master, hdd is slave.

Nope, but I figured it was possible since they're both IDE.  It seemed
worth mentioning both issues, anyway.

Yup.

Yeah...it does.  I'm just running a clean 2.2.13 right now.  I'll
patch up to the most 2.2.14pre*, if you think it'd help, but it
doesn't look like much has changed recently with the relevant bits.
Any ideas?
