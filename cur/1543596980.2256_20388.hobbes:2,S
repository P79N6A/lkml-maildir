Hi!
Long time ago I noticed that forced reboot from multiuser (/ mounted
rw long time ago) sometimes does not force filesystem check. It
happened again today...
So I remounted r/o and fsck-ed. And hey, they are errors: [zero dtimes
are ok, but bitmap differences really are not].
I *think* that we do not force ordering of "mark filesystem unclean"
and writes to filesystem. And we really *should* force that
ordering... Quick and dirty solution would be to sync just after we
mark filesystem dirty...
