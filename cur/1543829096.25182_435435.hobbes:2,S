I modified my exit_recv.c so that
1) i can totally skip data marked  TASKSTATS_TYPE_AGGR_TGID
2) i can optinally drop data after receipt without writing to disk
The first case produced a system time of 1.34 second and the second
case produced a system time of 1.25 sec.  Big improvement over 1.74
sec, but still too high compared to 0.34 sec when we disable tgid
completely.
Shailabh and me now eye on the lock patch that fixed an exit race
crash i reported. The global lock was held too long in scanning threads.
Shailabh is working on a new patch.
