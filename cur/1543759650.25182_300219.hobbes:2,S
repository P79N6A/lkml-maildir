Great, with this patch I can setup an encrypted swap partition,
and resume from it (after the initramfs asked for the password
and set up the dm-crypt table).
But wait, I'm using swapfiles. swap is fine with files.
what about swsuspend? and if it works with files, too,
what about this resume interface?
