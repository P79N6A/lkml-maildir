Hi, the sound volume is extremely low for my 2.2.1 kernel and
attempting to change the volume through the mixer seems to have no
effect.  I'm using the PAS16 driver compiled as a module:
CONFIG_SOUND=m
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=m
CONFIG_SOUND_PAS=m
CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB=m
CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812=m
With these settings in my conf.modules:
alias sound pas2
options sb pas2=1
options pas2 io=0x220 irq=11 dma=7 joystick=1
I searched the archives but couldn't find any answers or obvious
mistakes on my part.
Other than that, the new modular sound driver is pretty impressive and
Red Hat's sndconfig (running on my Debian system) was able to
configure sound almost immediately.
Thanks,
Navin.
PS 2.2.1 definitely flies.
