the tool still has a place... for folks not using cpufreq/2.6 especially.  
but also the longrun cpufreq driver is lacking support for 
scaling_available_frequencies, and doesn't display the voltages anywhere.  
in most cases the ACPI P-states driver works fine instead though.
i prefer the tool -- but then my requirements are pretty specific (i don't 
want cpufreq doing anything i'm not expecting while doing perf/debugging 
work).
