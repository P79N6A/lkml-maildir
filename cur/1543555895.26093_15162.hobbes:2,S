Should the
echo "512 1024 1536" > /proc/sys/vm/freepages
apply only to DMA pages?
(It would work correctly with <16 M machines, and probably ok with others)
Sidenote:
 Can you build a clean x86 computer that do not especially care about
 DMA able pages? (no ISA cards, no memory limited PCI cards, etc...)
 Would it then be nice to be able to remove that zone completely?
 (like we can with the HIGHMEM today)
