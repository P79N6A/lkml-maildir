In a post by Linus from 2 years ago, concerning the bash bug 
( 
http://lwn.net/2000/0120/a/lt-pid.html
 ), he also writes about
what holds from switching to 32 bit pids. and it's mainly 
because it's unclear about the way pids should be handled in 
a clustering environment.
According to the kernel patch made by the people at Cluster
Infrastructure ( 
http://ci-linux.sourceforge.net/
 ), today 
it is clear that the upper 16 bits of the pid are used for the node
number. 
Linus should consider applying Andries Brouwer's patch from October:
( http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100274734125520&w=2 )
This is really 2.5 material, but it slipped away for no apparent reason.
