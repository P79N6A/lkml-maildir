oh, come on.  the issue is whether memory is fast and flat.
most "scalability" efforts are mainly trying to code around the fact
that any ccNUMA (and most 4-ways) is going to be slow/bumpy.
it is reasonable to worry that optimizations for imbalanced machines
will hurt "normal" ones.  is it worth hurting uni by 5% to give
a 50% speedup to IBM's 32-way?  I think not, simply because 
low-end machines are more important to Linux.
the best way to kill Linux is to turn it into an OS best suited 
for $6+-digit machines.
> For applications that don't work well on clusters, you have no real
ccNUMA worst-case latencies are not much different from decent 
cluster (message-passing) latencies.  getting an app to work on a cluster
is a matter of programming will.
