Unfortunately evdev support in stock GPM is pretty much non-existant. It does
not use EV_SYNC and only works for relative devices. I have set of patches
that I consider proper implementation of user side of evdev interface, but I
am not sure if it is going to be included in GPM proper. For what it worth it
is in Fedora Code 2.
Now if I only had time to finish hotplug support for GPM...
