If the CPUs can't do it at all, #threads < 2 by the definition of CPUID.
I don't know that happens to the CPUID #threads value if the CPUs are
HT-capable but BIOS has disabled HT. (I'm not going to reboot our
Dual Xeon just to check this.) Why does it matter? If people BIOS-disable
HT in their Xeon boxes they get what they deserve. (Which is not to
say that doing so is wrong. HT isn't always a gain.)
