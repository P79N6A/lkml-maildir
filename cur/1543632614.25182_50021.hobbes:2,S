With the current code I've got these items on my list I class as
problematic.
1 Weird corruption report with AMD chipset in PIO mode
1 NULL pointer crash report on SiS chipset
2 Intel 845G issues (PIO only, incorrect BIOS setup)
1 set of requested Promise changes 
The 845G and Promise ones are present in both. The AMD one is utterly
weird and I'm still looking at the SiS one.
