I like accounting by time better because its accurate
and fair for all types of devices, however I admit an
auto tuning feature would be nice.
Say you allow 16 128K requests before seeking:
The HD will run the requests for 50ms then seek (8ms).
So this gives you about 86% efficiency.
On your zip drive it takes 666ms, giving you 96%.
Now with AS, allowing 50ms of requests before a seek
gives you the same for an HD, but only 66% for the MO
drive. A CD-ROM will be much worse.
Auto tuning wouldn't be too hard. Just measure the time
it takes for your seeking requests to complete and you
can use the simple formula to allow users to specify a
efficiency vs latency %age.
