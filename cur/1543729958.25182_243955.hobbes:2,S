Can someone explain why it isn't anyone with _write_ access to the device?
Surely it's better to drop a user into a group or setgid a program?
If I have write access to a device then I can wipe it's media anyway.
Is there something I'm missing?

OK, you keep the users out of the group and make the progaram setgid
cdwriters.
Then if someone makes a mess of the set[gu]id code you lose your
cdwriter (which would be gone anyway) and not your whole system.
Why force the program to escalate to root?
