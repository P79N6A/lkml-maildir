The device claiming to be b_host is not linux based. In any case this
is_b_host check won't do nothing here as we should check is
SetFeature(b_hnp_enbable) has been succesfull.
A device in b_host state is not enough for allowing hnp to happen.
Remember some devices doesn't support hnp in B roles, only a_hnp_support
is mandatory.
