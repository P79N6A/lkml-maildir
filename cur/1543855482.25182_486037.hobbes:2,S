That's the basic idea.  In our testbed, we had a single iSCSI server
exporting block devices to several clients -- each maintaining their
own local disk cache of the server exported block devices.  You can
configured either write-through or write-back policies -- write-back
has better performance, but somewhat obvious consistency issues in
failure cases.
The original intent was to combine this with the dm-cow target (which
I posted a few hours before the dm-cache patch) to provide a scalable
cluster deployment system based on back-end iSCSI or ATA-over-Ethernet
storage.
