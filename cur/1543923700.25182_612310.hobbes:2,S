Stuff it into a new file: arch/Kconfig
We can then extend this file to include all the 'trailing'
Kconfig things that are anyway equal for all ARCHs.
But it should be kept clean - so if we introduce such a file
then we should use ARCH_HAS_whatever in the arch specific Kconfig
files to enable stuff that is not shared.
