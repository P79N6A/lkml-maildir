For now I've added an #ifdef to re-include that code for x86, while excluding 
it for x86_64. Also, is that up-to-date wrt. 2.6.12-rc3? I had merged part of 
your code (at least the most urgent ones).
Also, I'm thinking to a generic support for those conditional double 
includes... I'll post it when it'll be ready.
