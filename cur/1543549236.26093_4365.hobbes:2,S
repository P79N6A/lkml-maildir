What do you dislike ?  Stateless ipid looks much nicer to me than stateful
one (and the "security" lost by not refetching the secret is minimal, 
especially given the state of the random device on machines without diskio
and keyboard input)

You mean TCP output rewrite ? The fix was strictly sender side only 
(I first thought one of the ack changes alexey did was an attempt at a 
hackish receiver side solution, but he told me that was false)

When you have a non linux 2.4 sender you lose.

I agree.

No, it has nothing to do with tcp-impl ;), I discovered it while playing
with the ipids much earlier. With some bad luck could could get very similar
ISNs, which is probably bad (an easy fix is to do the secret hash with a 
stack copy instead of the static) 
(but it is not a show stopper I agree)

It has to be at least cache line aligned, otherwise the arrays wouldn't
make any sense at all, the power of two would just be a (imho misguided but
anyways) optimization.
When I count correctly sizeof(udp_mib) is 16 bytes currently (lots of
false sharing on 32/64byte cacheline sized architectures) and linux_mib
is 288 bytes currently (does not make any sense at all)

Appended.

The "unknown gain" is just removing a lot of complexity => speed and less
bugs.
The only advantage I know left is saving pmtus for a bit longer, but
I doubt it is worth the complexity.
Do you have any specific plan for salvaging tw recycling ? Just keeping
such an intrusive piece of code for benchmarks around looks wasteful
to me.
