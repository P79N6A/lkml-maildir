Since you mention Open source...
What if I showed you that tivoization discriminates against field of
endeavor?
  
http://opensource.org/docs/osd
  6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
  The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program
  in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict
  the program from being used in a business, or from being used for
  genetic research.
Wait, TiVo, you're saying I cannot use this modified version of the
program to do $whatever in this computer you sold me, and that's
solely because you don't want to let me?
Is this forceful restriction on how or where the program can be used
not a discrimination against fields of endeavor?
It's not a restriction imposed by the license of the program, but it
is a restriction imposed by the manufacturer of the equipment that
distributes the program, therefore, the conditions under which the
program is distributed are not only non-Free Software, they also fail
to meet the Open Source definition.
Neat, huh?
