add me to that list also.

I've already ask Steve about this and received his answers.
Can't say that I agree with them though, so I asked someone from
a Telecom Equipment Mfr. about this.  He said that it's just for
equipment testing, where technicians verify that hotswap works,
and they are impatient to wait, so they practice surprise removal
instead of coordinated removal.  He doesn't think that's how it's
actually done out in the field, just in test labs.
Preface question:  does cPCI support surprise removal (in the
PICMG specs, not in some implementation)?  I know that PCI hotplug
doesn't support surprise removal, only "coordinated" removal.
So the question that has to be answered IMO is:  do we want to
support surprise removal for something like manufacturing test,
which doesn't abide by the coordinated removal protocol?
or:  Do we have to support surprise removal, only because it can't
be prevented?  I expect that this is the case, but I still don't
see or understand the 20 ms time requirement.
