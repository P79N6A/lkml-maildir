All of them are still manufactored.
Each of these three architectures has more than one machine manufactured
2003 listed as one of the 500 fastest computers in the world (place 2
and 3 are Alpha and PowerPC machines that are faster than the fastest
i386 and ia64 machines in the world) [1].
SGI still sells many MIPS-based computers running IRIX.
With at about 3 million computers and notebooks sold with a preinstalled
Unix in 2003, PowerPC is definitely one of the most popular Unix
platforms today.
