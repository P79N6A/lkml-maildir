I thought that was strange myself, which is why I metioned it in the begining.
Also when I seen the results I reran the tests, all in single user mode,
freshreboot, put linux single on the CL, voila, sh mtest01.sh & mpg123 some.mp3,
and there is my test.  I know the numbers are crazy and I also know the
importance of having all other variables the same.
