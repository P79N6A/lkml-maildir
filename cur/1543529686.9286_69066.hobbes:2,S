You have a point here... I'll change the comment from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 if you all
agree.

I've been considering this as well during the weekend. Linus' pre-2.4.0 came
rather unexpected, so we don't have time anymore to cut the rough edges.
James: do you agree?

The video4linux case is very disputable: opening a hardware device twice is bad
practice. You're not allowed to do that with e.g. audio neither.

And so did I (for atyfb). Sidenote: life is sometimes much more easy on
non-ia32, where atyfb keeps on working fine...
So for 2.4.0, I think we should focus only on
  - Updated vfb, so new drivers do things well. I suggest to add a warning to
    the top of vfb that _new_ drivers not complying to the new rules will not
    be accepted (and I'll enforce this by asking Linus to remove any _new_
    drivers that don't).
  - Updated other fbdev (cfr. vfb), if possible
  - Clean ups and bug fixes
What do you think?
