Compiles and works fine with that patch applied. Thanks.
One thing I noticed after booting with the kernel without CONFIG_SUSPEND.
/proc/acpi/sleep no longer lists S3 (as expected), but /proc/acpi/wakeup 
does still list the device status for S3, which seems somewhat 
inconsistent:
Device	S-state	  Status   Sysfs node
VIY0	  S3	 disabled  pci:0000:01:0b.0
USB1	  S3	 disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.0
USB2	  S3	 disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.1
USB4	  S3	 disabled  pci:0000:00:1d.7
AMDM	  S3	 disabled  pci:0000:00:1f.6
LID	  S4	*enabled   
PWRB	  S4	*enabled   
Not sure if it's worth fixing though.
Cheers,
FJP
