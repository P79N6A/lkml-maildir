If you have a serial console on the server, you can get sysrq by
sending a serial break followed by the character.  See
drivers/char/serial.c on any 2.4 kernel.  Otherwise you could hack up a
module that calls handle_sysrq() directly.  Unless you are sending a
character that needs regs ('p'), kbd ('r') or tty ('k'), you can set
those parameters to NULL.  Any unrecognised character will try to use
kbd and tty parameters.
