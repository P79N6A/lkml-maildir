This patch is against linux-2417/drivers/video/mdacon.c to get 
non-Hercules MDA working. Actually it does nothing, than assume a non 
Hercules-MDA is compatible to "normal" Hercules. The current behaviour 
is something confussing...
The problem whith the current version is, if you have such a 
non-Hercules MDA it will detected while booting the kernel and you see a 
message like "MDA with 8k RAM detected". Unfortunatley this message is 
printed, but your card will _not_ be initialized, is it not recognized 
as Hercules-compatible. So you will see the boot-message (and assume it 
is working), but nothing on your MDA-console/monitor. So we have to 
change this. It would be correct, to modify mdacon.c to _not_ print a 
message about detecting a MDA is it not Hercules-compatible. But as i 
mentioned above, at least my card is detected as non-Hercules but seems 
fully compatible. So I would prefer, to consider any detected 
non-Hercules MDA as Hercules-compatible. Please note, there is also some 
special detection of "HerculesPlus" and "HerculesColor" in mdacon.c. 
Does anybody know about any non Hercules compatible MDA ?
TiA,
Jan
