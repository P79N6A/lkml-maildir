That was the problem! This is the first machine I bought assembled, 
and I hadn't noticed that the CD/DVD cables were the old 40 wire
cables. I do hope this is the last of the problems.
Thanks guys! Changed the cable, and speed went up from 3.3 to 19MB/s
(probably limited by the older harddrive too)... Thas was spectacular!
Of course, now DMA didn't switch off either.
Cheers,
John
