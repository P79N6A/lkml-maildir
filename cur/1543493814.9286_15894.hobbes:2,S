Hi Michael,
Thanks, I'll be waiting for this around end of this week.
I would like to burn a new CD with RedHat 5.9.7 (futur 6.0) with a proper kernel.
I'm also expecting official patches for the Quota fixes that I received and seem to work properly so far.
I'll be going back to Canada on Monday (tomorrow) and will not be able to do anything, myself, until Friday or Saturday anyway.
Thanks again,
Andre
