I didn't realize that all your postings to this list were the official
views of Steeleye?
I can't say what SGI will do on this, I'm an engineer not a manager,
I can however suggest to them that they do. As Willy said, if it was
an even playing field it would probably be a lot more likely they would,
compared to how it is today.
Cheers,
