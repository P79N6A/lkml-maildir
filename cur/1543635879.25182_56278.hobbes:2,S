	Start with fixing your picture (all hubs and wires, please).
Linux ARP never sends 1 broadcasts through 2 devices, so it seems there is 
a hub near Node_A (or Node_A is running bridging), I can't believe 230.1 
and 230.4 are directly connected with cross cable. Make sure you have
the needed host/subnet routes for each interface. Also, make
sure tcpdump really shows the ARP replies, make the tests with
arp -d IP ; ping -c 1 IP
