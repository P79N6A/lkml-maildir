For whitespace damage, you can try the following regex:
/\s\+$\| \+\ze\t/
Or if you use vim as an editor, you can add this to your vimrc:
highlight RedundantSpaces ctermbg=red guibg=red
match RedundantSpaces /\s\+$\| \+\ze\t/
For example, it will show 4 cases of trailing whitespace in the quoted
part of your email above. :)
