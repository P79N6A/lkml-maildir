Thanks for the response Ingo.
The natual affinity of tasklet execution is really the one iam trying to get
away from.
i.e in our devices, a single interrupt from our device indicates several
device virtual interrupts, so even if i have several tasklets for each
virtual device interrupts, the code that runs the real intr and schedules
tasklets will end up queueing all of them on a single cpu.
for e.g if i have 3 virtual device interrupts happen and they are all
indicated by a single real intr to the device. All 3 tasklets would be
queued to the same CPU.
cpu 0
-----
intr()
  queue tasklet_1
  queue tasklet_2
  queue tasklet_3
since tasklet 1,2 & 3 are totally independent virtual interrupts, we would
just kick 1,2,3 on different cpu's queues. even better, if there is any load
balencing, so each tasklet code running on a separate cpu's could pickup one
when they are done processing the current work.

you'll get a natural affinity of tasklets: they will run on the processor
where the tasklet got activated. Tasklets are just a special form of
softirqs, they have no context in the classic task sense, the only
difference they have to softirqs is that the tasklet code guarantees
single-threadedness of the function executed.
if you are going to rely on tasklets for good SMP scalability then i'd
suggest using a separate tasklet for every device IRQ. Then bind hardirqs
to a particular CPU - thus both the hardirq, the softirq/tasklet will run
on the same processor.
