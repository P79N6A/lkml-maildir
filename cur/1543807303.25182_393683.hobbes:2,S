Yo...
In normal case, using harddisk as a swap space i should ask how to cut
down swapping, or make swapping when idle, etc... My case is a little
bit diffrent... I have a 256MB video card, while 240MB of it is used
as a swap space. And the question is: how to tune kernel to swap more
often. I known swapped memory must be copied back to ram before beeing
used, so i'm looking for a reasonable tunning values...
What do You think about that mighty list ?
