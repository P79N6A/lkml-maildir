No you did not. You didn't fix the ones I reported. Which is why it got 
removed, and will not get added back until there is another maintainer.
The ones I reported were all about trusting the stack contents implicitly, 
and assuming that the unwind info was there and valid. Using things like 
"__get_user()" didn't fix it, because if a WARN_ON() happened while we 
held the mm semaphore and the unwind info was bogus, it would take a 
page-fault and deadlock.
Those kinds of things are not acceptable for debugging output. If I cannot 
use WARN_ON() because I hold the MM lock and I'm afraid there might be 
kernel corruption, then something is *wrong*!
And I told you guys this. Over *months*. And you ignored me. You told me 
everything was fine. Each time, somebody else ended up reporting a hang 
where the unwinder was at fault. And since I couldn't trust the 
maintainers to fix it, removing the broken feature that only caused more 
problems than it fixed was the only option.
And you clearly *still* haven't accepted the fact that the code was buggy. 
Does anybody wonder why I wouldn't merge it back?
