Do you know the pain with 'binary compatible' drivers under OS/2? The
vendors generally do not understand kernel programming very well, so the
drivers contain various bugs. If the source is closed, no one can fix
those bugs. I had to swap few versions of video and net card drivers till
I got rock stable OS/2 system. I don't want this in Linux!!!

I tried YOUR SciTech video driver for OS/2 and it trapped just after
installation. This is what I said - closed drivers are BUGGY! If you
release the sources (and make them compilable with some free compiler, for
example EMX), someone would fix that bug.
You are going to lose this way.
