I can but agree.

This may be improved further:
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t count)
{
	char *tmp = dest;
	while (count) {
		if (*src == '\0')
			break;
		*tmp++ = *src++;
		count--;
	}
	while (count) {
		*tmp++ = '\0';
		count--;
	}
	return dest;
}
Moving the check for *src == '\0' into the first loop seems
to let the compiler reuse the object code a little better
(may depend on the optimizer). Also note that your version
of the second loop needs an explicit  comparison with -1,
whereas mine uses an implicit comparison with 0.
Testing on the CRIS architecture, your version is 24 instructions,
whereas mine is 18. For comparison, Eric's one is 12 and the
currently used implementation is 26 (when corrected for the
off-by-one error by comparing with > 1 rather than != 0 in the
second loop).
Here is another version that I think is quite pleasing
aesthetically (YMMV) since the loops are so similar (it is 21
instructions on CRIS):
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t count)
{
	char *tmp = dest;
	for (; count && *src; count--)
		*tmp++ = *src++;
	for (; count; count--)
		*tmp++ = '\0';
	return dest;
}
This is probably the version I would choose if I were to decide
as the object code generated for the actual loops are optimal in
this version (at least for CRIS).

I think sizeof(int)-1 would be better than 3. ;)
And long would probably be better for the 64-bit architectures?

I guess another way would be to replace the second loop with
memset(s, '\0', n), but that would probably only be a win for
quite long paddings.
