It just occured to me - every platform driver should rely on ->probe()
and ->remove() because now we have "bind" and "unbind" attributes and
there are talks about providing a method to disable automatic binding
of drivers across bus or even entire system. So even without hotplug
there possibility that user might want to disable device by unbinding
driver.
I think it pretty safe to mark them __devinit and __devexit because they
become noops if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is set. There is trouble with "bind" and
"unbind" sysfs attributes when CONFIG_HOTPLUG=N but Greg promised to fix
that.
