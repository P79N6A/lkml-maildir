Here are some numbers I got when compiling the kernel on a 4-way 400MHz
Dechutes machine with 4GB memory.
Linux-2.3.13
time make -j 4 bzImage >/dev/null 2>&1
run 1
real	1m36.442s
user	4m49.060s
sys	0m22.300s
run 2

What do you expect from lmbench. As far as I know it measures cache, memory
and tlb miss latencies. For this bench there is no difference if the mapping
goes to low or big memory.
