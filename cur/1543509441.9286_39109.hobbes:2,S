   Not having SA_SIGINFO is a real pain if you like to participate towards
   certain application environments where you like to take appropriate
   actions (fail-over, ....).  Following this discussion I also have
   constant trouble for these parts of code where I like to alter my
   process context.  Will setcontext(2) and getcontext(2) be part of 2.4?
   Linux shows particular weak in this area ... or is my development
   environment to far behind (kernel-2.2.12/glibc-2.1.1-6)?
