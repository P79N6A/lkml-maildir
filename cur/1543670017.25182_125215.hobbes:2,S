Interesting. Then how do you explain this (2.5.67)
config MSDOS_PARTITION
	bool "PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support" if PARTITION_ADVANCED
	default y if !PARTITION_ADVANCED && !AMIGA && !ATARI && !MAC && !SGI_IP22 && !ARM && !SGI_IP27
or this (2.4.20)
   if [ "$CONFIG_AMIGA" != "y" -a "$CONFIG_ATARI" != "y" -a \
        "$CONFIG_MAC" != "y" -a "$CONFIG_SGI_IP22" != "y" -a \
        "$CONFIG_SGI_IP27" != "y" ]; then
      define_bool CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION y
   fi
In both cases, CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION is always y, *except* for Atari
and some others. According to your comment above, that should be
changed, shouldn't it?
