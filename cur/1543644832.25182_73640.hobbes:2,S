Hi Matthew,
Some more comments on the ethernet driver.
BTW, the original this came from is in the kernel tree
at arch/ppc/8xx_io/fec.c.

I don't think this will work. This is not a device that can be
determined to be present like a PCI device. It is more like an
ISA device, it needs to be probed to figure out if it is really
there. I can't see any way not to use Space.c for non-auto-detectable
type devices... (Offcourse I could be missing something :-)

I missed this the first time through :-)
I am not sure what you mean, CodingStyle enforcer?
Can you elaborate for me?
