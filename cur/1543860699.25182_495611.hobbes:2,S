The case to watch out for is
	flip_buffer_push -> ldisc -> driver write of echo/^S/^Q
if you call flip_buffer_push while holding your own lock you may get in
a mess on the echo path.

For non fake tty hardware at real speeds it wasn't a problem under about
1Mbit. Current tty layer code just uses memory buffering based on kmalloc
and has a 64K limit instead. Works better SMP, scales better and we no
longer need to do stunts like the flip buffers to scrape 56Kbit on a
386SX16
