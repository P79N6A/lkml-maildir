Subject: [RFC] suggestion [PATCH N/M] subject lines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/20/476

Reading the mailing list with a non-threads compatible 
mail client agent would be made much easier if the 
convention for subject lines for multi-part patches was 
changed to the following:
	patch set name [PATCH N/M] patch summary
Then sorting by subject would group all patches for the
Same patch set together.
I don't know if these Subject lines are hand generated, or if there
is software involved that would have to me modified for generating
and/or parsing them.
Comments?
