But we generated kaddr by using __va, as above? If the user mapped /dev/mem
and created a second possible answer for a P->V mapping, that seems
irrelevant, as long as __va always returns the "primary" mapping into kernel
virtual address space.
I'd agree we're lacking some error checking here (maybe virt_to_page should
be an inline that checks that kaddr really is a kernel virtual address), but I 
can't see a real practical problem in the scenario you describe. As other
people seem to be able to, maybe I'm missing something ;-)
I'm not sure if your arch is a 32-bit or 64-bit arch, but I see more of a problem
in this code if we do "page = virt_to_page(__va(phys_addr));" on a physaddr
that's in HIGHMEM on a 32 bit arch, in which we get garbage from the wrapping,
and Daniel's "page = phys_to_page(phys_addr);" makes infintely more sense.
Martin.
