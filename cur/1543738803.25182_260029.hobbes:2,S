I've created the typescript as suggested but the only thing I found that 
seemed out off place is the following line, altough I don't think it's got 
anything todo with the error I'm getting.
 CC [M]  fs/binfmt_misc.o
include/asm/string.h:32: warning: `strcpy' defined but not used
Everyhting else seems normal.
Kind regards
steph
