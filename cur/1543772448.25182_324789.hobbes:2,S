Only if you run SOFT IRQs as SA_NODELAY, which is going to KILL all your
preemption gains with the first arriving network packet.
And that is, if you don't get buried in "scheduling while atomic" printk
messages first.
SA_NODELAY is not generally allowed in PREEMPT_RT, except for code
designed to take advantage of the IRQ void that has been created. 
This code must follow a new set of rules, which people who design RT
apps are really happy to accet, they have to accept worse compromises
with the alternatives (subkernel or ANOTHER OS (ugh))
