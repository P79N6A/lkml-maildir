Read the message:  it doesn't say the compiler will notice and not pass
the "self" pointer.  That's your job.

}
foo3.C *needs* the "self" pointer you are so worried about.  If you want
to prevent the self pointer from being passed, make it a non-member function
or make it a static member function, and stop complaining...or depending
on what foofunc is notionally supposed to do, leave it non-static so the
writers of child classes don't have to fix it for you.
Better yet, whenever you don't know a language well enough to use it at the
level you expect of yourself, spend the time to learn it, lest your code
disappoint you or your toes not match your culinary standards.
