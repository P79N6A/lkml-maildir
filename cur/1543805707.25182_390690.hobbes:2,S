I believe that if v2 and v3 turn out to be incompatible, it would be
quite hard to rationalise v3+ licensed files inside the kernel. So when
people want their code to be in the kernel and still be v3+ compatible,
they should probably dual license it, or include a specific section
saying that the code can be licensed under v2 only if in the context of
the Linux kernel.

I'm not sure this is the correct interpretation of the current draft. I
assume you're referring to this part:
GPLv3-draft1:

I'd interpret that as forcing people who try to hide their code or make 
it difficult to get at the source code to not be able to do that. I'm 
not sure this would affect the Linux kernel at all and I don't think it 
would require any of your private keys to be disclosed at all. If you 
would sign or encrypt the kernel distribution with your private key, 
everyone would need to have access to your public key, but that's the 
whole idea anyway.
