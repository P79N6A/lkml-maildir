No, but yes it can be done, overloading the meaning.
It would need to change in the future if vread was needed.
I have no strong argument against  using it.
Although we may still need the IA64 define, I removed 32bit read mmio and
if that is brought back the fast syscall patch call will need to have a 
field in the
clocksource struct that would indicated that. Waiting on comments about 
that...
John and discuss this awhile back felt it was not needed, may prove wrong.
