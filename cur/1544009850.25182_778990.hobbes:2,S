Subject: [PATCH 1/1] devices cgroup: allow mkfifo
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/10/152

The devcgroup_inode_permission() hook in the devices whitelist
cgroup has always bypassed access checks on fifos.  But the
mknod hook did not.  The devices whitelist is only about block
and char devices, and fifos can't even be added to the whitelist,
so fifos can't be created at all except by tasks which have 'a'
in their whitelist (meaning they have access to all devices).
Fix the behavior by bypassing access checks to mkfifo.
