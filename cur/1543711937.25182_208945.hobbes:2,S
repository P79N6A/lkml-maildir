2.6.5-rc2-mm2 hung during boot for me.
The last messages was
Setting up ICE socket directory ... done
which is from the xserver-common init script.
Then I got a line saying
INIT:
and nothing more happened.  The capslock and numlock keys
toggled their LEDs, and that was it.  The only sysrq sequence
working was sysrq+B, so I booted it.
Then I tried 2.6.5-rc2-mm2 single-user.
I acutally got the command prompt, everything seemed ok,
but then I ran "init 2", got the message about
killing processes and nothing more happened again.
There were no "INIT:" message this time.
2.6.5-rc1-mm2 works.
