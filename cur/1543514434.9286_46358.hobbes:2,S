We ship journaling reiserfs to SuSE today, and it will be in SuSE 6.3.  You can
also get it from our website tomorrow.

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
