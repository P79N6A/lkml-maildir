Yes, but see the caveat in my other email. You need to have git-1.5.1 or 
newer to have this work (it will *mostly* work in older versions, but 
older versions have a terminating problem, so while it actually does the 
bisection correctly, it will screw up at the very end unless all commits 
in the final range are "dense" in that they all trigger in those 
pathnames).

That file got folded into the user manual, so it doesn't exist as a 
stand-alone thing any more.
