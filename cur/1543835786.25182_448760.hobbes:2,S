So you use a repacker.  Nice thing about a repacker is, everyone has 
downtime.  Better to plan to be a little sluggish when you'll have 
1/10th or 1/50th of the users than be MUCH slower all the time.
You're right, though, to ask the question:

Anyone care to run some very long benchmarks?

Oh, I'm curious -- do hard drives ever carry enough battery/capacitance 
to cover their caches?  It doesn't seem like it would be that 
hard/expensive, and if it is done that way, then I think it's valid to 
leave them on.  You could just say that other filesystems aren't taking 
as much advantage of newer drive features as Reiser :P
Anyway, remember that the primary tool of science is not logic.  Logic 
is the primary tool of philosophy.  The primary tool of science is 
observation.
Sorry, the only machines I could really run this on are about to be in 
remote only mode for a couple weeks.  I'm hesitant to hit them too hard.
