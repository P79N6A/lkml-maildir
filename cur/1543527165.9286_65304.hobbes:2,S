I'm afraid it's not as devious as you'd like to make out. In recent
days people have been talking about "cleaning up /proc". In that
context, it's not inconsistent to advocate using devfs.
Furthermore, as Peter pointed out last week, we're better off putting
stuff in devfs than procfs, since at least devfs tries to solve some
problems. It doesn't make sense to argue against devfs yet argue for
procfs. If you do that, it just sounds like "I don't like Richard's
devfs because I don't like it".

Yes, that would work.

The way I envisioned it, a disc-based /dev would have (for example)
/dev/cpu being a symlink to $devfsroot/cpu
Having two hierarchies encoded isn't good.
