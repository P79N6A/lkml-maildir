Alan, that's a complete load of bollocks.  It broke common configurations 
of java, postfix and apache on real-world machines, causing significant
actual denials of service in previously reliable configurations.
How about "A kernel upgrade in a -stable series replaced one potential
DoS with another DoS and provided a tunable knob to select which DoS you
would prefer, defaulting to the opposite of the previous behaviour"

Yeah, I have an idea about that, but I need to see if it's actually
viable within the code.  The DoS works by creating epoll descriptors
watching other epoll descriptors, which strikes me as a much less
real-world actual use pattern than a bunch of separate daemons with an
epoll watcher each.
If it's possible to count watches only if they're added to another epoll
instance, then we'd have a metric that still catches the N^2 attack, but
doesn't interact with the common non-attacky use-case.
I'd be much happier if we could remove the dichotomy of "allow the DoS
or live with a highly crippled epoll implementation until some of the
biggest daemons out there change their usage patterns" (thinking
particularly of java 1.6 and apache here.  Largish postfix installations
are much rarer)
