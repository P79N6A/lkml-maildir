Drifting a little (perhaps).  "make allnoconfig" produces
a config that doesn't compile. Lots or warnings during compile
about implicit declaration of ia64_pfn_valid.  Then link errors
for vmem_map and ia64_pfn_valid.
What's the right thing to do about this?  It's been broken for a
long time (definitely since SPARSE support was added, perhaps longer).
