Is there also a fix available to make the bass and treble settings
work again in mixer applications (for example, Gnome mix 1.2.0)?
This is (now, was) one of the biggest advantages of this card to have
control over bass and treble settings. 
It worked for the early 2.2.18pre patches, but stopped working in
the latest ones (including final 2.2.18).
