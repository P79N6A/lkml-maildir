It's not a theory.  It's a result of observing a -j 16 build with the 
sources on an NFS mounted file system with top with and without the 
patches and comparing that with the same builds with the sources on a 
local file system.  Without the patches the tasks in the kernel build 
all get the same dynamic priority as the X server and other interactive 
programs when the sources are on an NFS mounted file system.  With the 
patches they generally have dynamic priorities between 6 to 10 higher 
than the X server and other interactive programs.
In both cases, when the build is run on a source on a local file system 
the kernel build tasks all have dynamic priorities 6 to 10 higher than 
the X server and other interactive programs.
In all cases, the dynamic priorities of the X server and other 
interactive programs are the same.
In the testing that I have done so far the patch has not resulted in any 
genuine interactive tasks not being identified as interactive.

PS There's a difference between interruptible and interactive in that 
while all interactive sleeps will be interruptible not all interruptible 
sleeps are interactive.  Ingo introduced TASK_NONINTERACTIVE to enable 
this distinction to be made.
