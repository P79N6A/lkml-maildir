I disagree.  The linux server should be using unique Transaction ID's 
in the dns header for each unique dns request.  Otherwise there is no 
way to distinguish them (same A record request).  Of course the 
firewall is going to drop a reply that it thinks it already saw a reply 
for 30ms ago.
This appears to be a bug in the way glibc is handling things but i 
cannot be sure.  That is the goal of my investigation.
