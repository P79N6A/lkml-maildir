No, they are documented as "here lie penguin-eating monsters - DO NOT GO
HERE".

No need - block the "DO NOT USE THESE BITS" calls.

IOW, pass the buck to every app that runs? Let's go one better, shall we,
and put file access controls in userspace too? And network protocol
handling, scheduling, etc. In fact, let's just remove the whole OS and go
with an MS DOS clone, and leave EVERYTHING up to userspace! :-)
One of the functions of an OS is to act as the interface between hardware
and applications. The approach being advocated here by some is "just leave
the unmarked minefield sitting in the penguin enclosure - we'll squeegee
Tux off the walls later". I'd rather keep the munitions somewhere else.

And how does it do that - strace every app running as root, so it can
filter ioctl calls?!

They aren't "undocumented" per se; they are low-level vendor-specific
commands for diagnostic purposes.

What you are trying to do in this case is send one very specific command
(or set of commands), as a one-off (much like a genuine firmware upgrade,
in fact). There should be a specific interface for doing this.

Under normal circumstances, yes. Then you use a bootdisk with a suitable
kernel on for performing firmware upgrades etc.
Right now, I can't update my motherboard's BIOS from Linux either - I have
to drop out into FreeDOS for that. I'd view that as a strength of Linux,
not a flaw.

Hmmm - maybe that's why XFree86 filters your mode selection based on what
monitor you have?? And why monitors filter the signal, to reject anything
which is inappropriate?
If I try running my monitor at 16000x12000 @ 1kHz, XFree86 will barf. If I
reduce that to something plausible enough to get past XFree86, but not
suitable for ye olde CRT, ye olde CRT just rejects it and starts flashing
a little LED on the front. Only valid signals get through.
Now, the drive CANNOT tell which commands are "valid" and which are not -
so the OS must do it for the drive.

I'd rather prevent the intruder being able to kill the disk in the first
place. Obviously, we also try to prevent him being able to get in, but
that's another issue.

Not if it was killed this way.

If one of my CC numbers gets stolen, I can just tell the bank about it and
get it replaced. No big deal - just a bit of a nuisance.

This is not a "give me your data or die" decision. It's more of an "I've
got your data, now I'm going to kill you" situation. Personally, having
been robbed, I'd rather remain alive afterwards.
