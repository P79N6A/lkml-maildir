Did you provide an interface to get the complete FPU state yet ? I don't
think developing code will be much fun when you cannot see the XMMX registers...

I cannot think of anything that could not be handled in a clean and not-to-slow
way (AFAIK, ptrace FPU access is mostly used when debugging which is not normally
performance-critical).

This common kernel does not have security holes (that can be fixed).
Even though it does not use 486+-specific instructions, it has no serious
performance impact. For games, we are talking about 30% - 60% here IMO.

Yes. Nevertheless, the main reason (I think) for splitting up the architecture
is to achieve maximal performance for a given processor.

IA32 _is_ ugly.
