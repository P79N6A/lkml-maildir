I believe that you only want a single one of the CONFIG_FB options set.  As I 
recall, having more then one built in to the kernel causes problems, 
especially with VGA16 and VESA.  Why not just turn on CONFIG_FB_VESA=y, and 
make the others modules (=m).
Why not turn off, or at least build as modules, all the things you aren't 
really going to be using.  Building everything into the kernel is a good way 
to cause yourself problems.
As an example, part of my config is:
CONFIG_FB=y
# CONFIG_FB_PM2 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_CYBER2000 is not set
# CONFIG_FB_IMSTT is not set
# CONFIG_FB_VGA16 is not set
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
The only things turned on in the graphics section are displayed above.
