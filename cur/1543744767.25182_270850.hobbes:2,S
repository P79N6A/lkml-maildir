Indeed. Please don't use pushfl/popfl to save the carry flag. There are 
tons of better ways.
For example, use "lea" instead of "add" to not write the flags (and add a 
comment). Or save the carry flag in a register with
	sbb %bx,%bx
ant test %bx later. Or any of a million other _standard_ ways to handle
this problem.
