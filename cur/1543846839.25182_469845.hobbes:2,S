There was a patch posted in the past, mentioned in the thread discussed 
my #gccbug branch, that permitted annotations with zero code size 
changes.  I think that sort of annotation approach would be preferred. 
It was something like
#define noinit_warning(x) \
	do { (void) (x) = (x); } while (0)
but given my memory, that's probably all wrong.
So, I agree that annotations are a good idea, but I'm not so sure that 
your proposed "= 0" approach is the best one.  Remember, we need to do 
this for multi-member structures, integers, and pointers, not just 
things easily assigned to zero.
