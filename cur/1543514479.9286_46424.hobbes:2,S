Hi all,
 Since I tried 2.2.13pre17 and 2.2.13 final, every kernel
I've built hasn't been able to insert 3rd party modules
(ones not included in the main tree)
I tried the SB Live module, and some standalone modules I
wrote myself. Anything built as a module from the main tree
works fine, but if I try to insert sblive.o or my own module,
I get errors about undefined symbols for stuff like 'jiffies'
'printk' etc..
What I find bizarre is the same .config on 2.2.13pre15
produces a kernel which works fine.
CONFIG_MODULES = y
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS = y
CONFIG_KMOD = y
I've installed System.map too, and the missing symbols are
defined within it..
Any ideas as to what I've screwed up?
regards,
Dave.
