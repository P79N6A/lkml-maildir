  Hm, found a buglet in my former filtering rewrite -- the condition in the preceding if stmt should be a reverse one, and speed limitation to XFER_UDMA_3 should have been left under it.  With the current code, XFER_UDMA_2 limitation wouldn't have been applied if the same drive is not in both 'bad_ata66_4' and 'bad_ata66_3' lists -- this, however, actually is not the case since WDC AC310200R drive is in both these lists (maybe I wrote it this way because of this fact :-).

  Yeah, I'm definitely having trouble understanding my own code after some months have passed... :-/
