Well that's some pretty sad code you've found there.  The kernel surely has
some appropriate type to use here without us having to invent a new one. 
But I suspect if we were to rationalise things in there it will get messy.
I think your patch can be cast more neatly if we use #elif:
--- a/include/pcmcia/cs_types.h~pcmcia-ppc64-needs-64-bit-ioaddr_t
+++ a/include/pcmcia/cs_types.h
@@ -21,12 +21,16 @@
 #include <sys/types.h>
 #endif
 
-#if defined(__arm__) || defined(__mips__)
+#if defined(__powerpc64__)
+/* I/O addresses are really MMIO addresses on PPC, and can thus be 64 bits */
+typedef unsigned long ioaddr_t;

 typedef u_int   ioaddr_t;
 #else
 typedef u_short	ioaddr_t;
 #endif

 typedef unsigned long kio_addr_t;
 
 typedef u_short	socket_t;
_
Also, I wonder if `unsigned long' is the correct type to use here.  32-bit
userspace will treat it as 32-bit and 64-bit userspace will treat it as
64-bit.
Would it be better to use uint64_t here?
