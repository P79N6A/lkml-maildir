Uh, thanks! I was looking at fs/block_dev.c.
 if (blk_size[MAJOR(dev)])
  size = ((loff_t) blk_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)] << BLOCK_SIZE_BITS) >> blocksize_bits;
which sets the size to the entered blk_size << 10 - blksize_bits.
I missed that BLOCK_SIZE_BITS was constant but blksize_bits is variable.
Amongst other things.

But this is not so .. it is the default, not the rule. And it is only
the default if the block size is the default value.

Err .... they mean the BLOCK SIZE of all ...

Never used. Thanks for clearing that up!
If you knew if the meaning of blk_size had ever changed, and when in
terms of kernel version, that would also be very very helpful.
