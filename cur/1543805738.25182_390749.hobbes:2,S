hmm, so if I want to contribute to the kernel, but prefer my code to be 
licensed under GPLv3 or higher, I would be unable to submit it to the 
kernel unless I "lower my standards" to GPLv2 or higher?
If someone wants to use that code elsewhere, he can take it from the 
kernel and re-use it in a GPLv2 project and further, which may violate 
the terms of GPLv3 and would therefore conflict with my interests.
Of course, this may be purely theoretical, but it could block people 
from submitting code to the kernel in order avoid the v2 GPL license.
 From this, I think it could be concluded that it might turn out to be 
quite harmful if code under GPLv3+ cannot be combined with the linux 
kernel...
