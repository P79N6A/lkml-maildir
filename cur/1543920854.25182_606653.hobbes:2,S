If you look at the git logs, you'll notice there's some progress towards
this.  It's already the case for the narrow boards.  I have a patch to
rip it all out for the wide boards, but there's clearly a bug because it
crashes my parisc machine.  Works fine on x86 though.  I can't work on
it this week because I'm travelling and the parisc machine with remote
power died on me last week.
I think I already suggested a temporary CONFIG_VIRT_TO_BUS dependency to
akpm last week.
