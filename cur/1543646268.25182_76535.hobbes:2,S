The convenience names for the root FS *have* been in the kernel since
before 2.4.x. I agree with the initramfs approach: that's been my plan
for handling the rootFS compatibility names (put a mini devfsd into
initramfs). But until all the infrastructure for that is ready, you
can't just go around breaking features people rely on. Especially
where there is no benefit to breaking it.
If you really feel strongly about it, and don't want to wait for
devfsd to be added to initramfs, by all means move the current code
(or the moral equivalent) to initramfs. But you'll have to wait for
initramfs to be available and for it to be the default.
