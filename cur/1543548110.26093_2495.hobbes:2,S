It contains code in arch/i386/mtrr.c that looks pretty much like
my "64 bit MTRR" patch that was posted on lkml some time last year
and makes use of the full 36 bit MTRR address and size on Intel and
44 bits on AMD Athlon. BTW my patch contained some new ioctls
which exports this capability to user space...
Which of the smaller patches contain this code?
Your comments do not describe this particular piece of code.
