I wonder if it might better to explicitly take the rq lock and try to
put the task on this_rq in this situation?  Rather than waiting for
schedule to pull it from a remote rq as part of balance_rt_tasks.
A question that has passed through my head a few times is:  When waking
a RT task is it better to:
1) run on current CPU if possible
2) run on CPU task previously ran on
I think #1 may result in lower latency.  But, if the task has lots of
cache warmth the lower wakeup latency may be negated by running on a
'remote' cpu.
