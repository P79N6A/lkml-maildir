In my experience (PIII 1.2GHz, i815, e100, NAPI), user mode
would read at most 7 packets at a time, even when artificial
busy loops insterted. The max packet rate acheived was
around 120Kpps, but that was limited at the driver level.
Most of the CPU was consumed while doing this (measured with
cyclesoak, especially required since NAPI was used).
