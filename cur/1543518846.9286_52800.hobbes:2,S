The mappings can't be 1:1, because the current kernel uses set1 (XT)
keycodes, while the driver operates with set2 (AT) or set3 (PS/2)
keycodes, which are much more reasonable.
The userland utility for loading these mappings is still to be written,
but I'm working on that. ;) Right now you can add any codes you need
directly to the driver tables.
