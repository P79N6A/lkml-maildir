if I do a sync and echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches does the reboot is
still necesary ?

I boot linux, I start rtorrent and start the download, while it's
downloading I start evolution and i check my mail(my mbox is very large,
several hundered megabytes), I close evolution(I use evolution just to
have another application witch uses the filesystem and the memory), I
start evolution again. I start firefox. The download is complete.
Rtorrent says if the hash is good or not. I do a "unrar t qwe.rar" to
test that all 84 downloaded rar files are ok and see the result.

I will test.
