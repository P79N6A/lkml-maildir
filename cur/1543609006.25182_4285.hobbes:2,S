The following prints a single value as ASCII for Linux, Solaris,
AIX, Tru64, HP-UX, and any other POSIX system.
ps -o uid= -p 1
This is what you are supposed to do. With the above, you can write
portable shell scripts that work on any UNIX. (real UNIX + Linux)

The app fixing starts immediately for stuff in /bin. It is all
the k-apps and g-apps that will lag.
Splitting /proc can be done. Start by mounting procfs twice.
Make non-process stuff in /proc invisible, but still available.
Then in /kernel the process stuff can be disabled. The proc fs
code can even register two filesystem types, with different
default mount options. After a while, /proc/cpuinfo and such
can emit warnings. (2.5.z for z>42, and 2.y.z for y>6) Then for
the 3.1 kernel (10 years away?) the old crud gets removed.
