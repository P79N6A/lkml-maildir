   Clearly you have missed a large chunk of the discussion.
And again, clearly you have missed the discussion where it has been
pointed out repeatedly that this is insufficient; a program may need to
be setuid "daemon" (or some other non-root UID), so that it has the
ability to access files owned by a particular uid, as well as have some
capabilities set.
Therefore, using setuid root is insuficient.   Q.E.D.
