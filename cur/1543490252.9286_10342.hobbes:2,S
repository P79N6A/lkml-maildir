I'm trying to fix the afpfs kernel module and afpmount to work with
kernel 2.2.x.  I have been unable to reach the maintainer as his server
appears to be down and has been for several days.  So I thought I'd ask
about the problems here.  They may be stupid problems, since I'm a
pretty novice programmer.  Here they are:
afpfs uses the s_mounted variable that was contained in the 2.0.x struct
super_block
afpfs uses the i_dirt variable that was contained in the 2.0.x struct
inode
So I guess my problem is I don't really know what 2.2.x has that's
equivalent.  If anyone could help I'd appreciate it.  Please cc me
personally on any reply to this message, as I do not subscribe to the
kernel list.  Thanks very much.
