Both are right, as it so happens.

In 2.5, the device lock most likely would be the queue lock as well so
no confusion there. But what are you talking about? I'd assume that the
device lock must be held in the transfer function, why else would you
grab it in the first place in the function you quote? Please, if you are
going to find examples to support the recursive locking idea, find some
decent ones...
I think you are trying to make up problems that do not exist. I'd hate
to see recursive locks being used just because someone can't be bothered
to write to code correctly (recursive locks have its uses, the one you
are advocating definitely isn't one). Recursive locks are _not_ a remedy
for someone who doesn't understand locking or isn't capable enough to
design his locking correctly. Period.
