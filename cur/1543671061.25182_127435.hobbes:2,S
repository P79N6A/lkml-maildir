Well, 90% of the BK repositories are in read-only mode for me, i.e. just
mirros of some public repository.  I couldn't care less whether a
corruption sneaked in, I'll just reclone as soon as the mainers complains
my patches don't apply anymore :)  So putting this get faster hints
somewhere where they could be found easily (or even a go fast option
for bk clone that applies this..) would be really nice.
