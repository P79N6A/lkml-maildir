Here's a simple way to do what you want in userspace:
1) Apply the kernel bind mount options fix (*)
2) Run the following shell script
cat <<'EOF' >fsviews.bash
#! /bin/bash
# First make the subdirectories
mkdir /fsviews_orig
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /fsviews_rw
mkdir /fsviews_orig/dir1
mkdir /fsviews_orig/dir2
mkdir /fsviews_orig/old
# Now make it read-only with a copy in /fsviews
mkdir /fsviews
mount --bind /fsviews_orig /fsviews
# Put directories in /fsviews
mount --bind /somewhere/dir1 /fsviews/dir1
mount --bind -o ro /otherplace/dir2 /fsviews/dir2
# Start the process in a new namespace
clone_prog bash <<'BACK_TO_OLD_NAMESPACE'
mount -o ro,remount /fsviews_orig
pivot_root /fsviews /fsviews/old
umount -l /fsviews/old
/dir1/myscript &
BACK_TO_OLD_NAMESPACE
# Remove the extra dirs in this namespace
umount -l /fsviews
umount -l /fsviews_orig
rmdir /fsviews
rmdir /fsviews_orig
EOF
This assumes that clone_prog is a short C program that does a clone() 
syscall
with the CLONE_NEWNS flag and executes a new process.
Once this is done, "/dir2/script" is running in a _completely_ new 
namespace
with a read-only root directory and two directories from other parts of 
the vfs.
(*) IIRC currently bind-mount rw/ro options are those of the underlying 
mount,
the bind-mount options fix provides a separate set of options for each 
bound
copy.  There is only one minimal security implication without said 
patch, that
root can still 'mount -o rw,remount /' to get root writeable again, but 
since it's
on tmpfs, that doesn't matter much.  You could also just take away some
capabilities, but otherwise except for the shared process tables this 
acts very
much like a completely new, separate computer.  I've used this to 
thoroughly
secure minimally trusted daemons before. :-D
Cheers,
