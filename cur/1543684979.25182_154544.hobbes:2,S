It is acceptable. This thread is getting carried away. Just because we 
continued talking doesn't mean there is suddenly a big problem. There is no 
sudden drop in performance or handling. It's a tiny tweak which helps and 
there is no evidence of harm, only a theoretical concern on Nick's part which 
ended up being a discussion about the merits of sleep_avg as a method of 
determining interactivity. Yes there probably is a better way of doing it 
(and I have embarked on one that I stopped doing), but a redesign from 
scratch now is not what Ingo wants, and I see the logic in his reasoning.
