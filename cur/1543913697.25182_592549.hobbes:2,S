Subject: [PATCH -mm 4/5] Hibernation: Correct definitions of some ioctls (rev. 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/9/144

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Three ioctl numbers belonging to the hibernation userland interface,
SNAPSHOT_ATOMIC_SNAPSHOT, SNAPSHOT_SET_IMAGE_SIZE, SNAPSHOT_AVAIL_SWAP,
SNAPSHOT_GET_SWAP_PAGE, are defined in a wrong way (eg. not portable).  Provide
new ioctl numbers for these ioctls and mark the existing ones as deprecated.
