I have changed the syntax to allow creating/removing test files and test 
running in separate stages:
sysbench --test=fileio --file-total-size=3G prepare
sysbench --num-threads=16 --test=fileio --file-total-size=3G  
--file-test-mode=rndrw run
sysbench --test=fileio cleanup
The updated version is available from the SysBench page at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sysbench/
