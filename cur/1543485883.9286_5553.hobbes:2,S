Subject: VFAT/FAT32 Patch - Request for Info.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have a quick patch for 2.2.x that cleans up the error reported
when the fat fs encounters a FAT32X partition. However, I've had
very little luck in finding the details of the filesystem.
FAT32X is superset of FAT32, it is used to support partitions larger 
than 8gigs on IDE drives. It has been present since Win95 OSR2.  I have 
not been able to get any details on how the fsinfo structure has changed. 
If anyone has the information I'd love to implement a 'real' fix. Otherwise, 
I'll try my hand at the raw filesystem and see if I can 'reverse engineer' 
the differences. (But I would REALLY REALLY prefer not to do that) My 
current problem is that I only have one drive partitioned as FAT32X and 
I can't 'spare' it for testing.  
Well, here's the patch and I'd appreciate any further information 
anyone has...
