Don't forget the L1/L2/L3 caches. I had once a mainboard with a faulty
L2 cache chip ('twas a K6-3 CPU, plus a FIC VA-503+ mainboard). No memory
or CPU test found the failure, yet kernel compliation was still crashing
after 6-8 hours.
I modified the 'memtest.c' little proggy (not the big memtest86, just a
little utility that runs under Linux), to use patterns and test size
that tests the L1 and then L2, and the error has shown after ten seconds
of running the test.
