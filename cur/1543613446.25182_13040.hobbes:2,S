This patch was done against the kernel 2.4.17-pre8. All the drivers that
are using the HDLC layer in the kernel source tree have been included.
The farsync.c does not even call the register_hdlc_device routine... 
Let's fix what is already in the kernel source tree first, and then we
can include what is missing (e.g. the PC300 driver and others that
provide separate patches for the HDLC layer), right?!

Why doing that if it is ready for 2.4.x?!
The patch that I've just sent doesn't bring anything really new. It just
fixes what is wrong in the current version. Am I missing something here?

That is exactly what I have to do...
