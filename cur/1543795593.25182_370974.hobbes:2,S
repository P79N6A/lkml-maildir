Subject: [SCSI] aic7xxx: reset handler selects a wrong command
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello Justin
To transport scsi reset command to device aic7xxx reset handler looks at the
driver's pending_list and searches any proper command. However the search
condition has been inverted: ahc_match_scb() returns TRUE if a matched command
is found.
As a result the reset on required devices did not turn out well, a correctly
working neighbour device may be surprised by the reset. aic7xxx reset handler
reports about the success, but really the original situation is not corrected yet.
The problem has been found first on 2.4 kernels but still it is present in
latest 2.6 drivers too.
Marcelo, you can use this patch for 2.4 kernel tree.
Thank you,
