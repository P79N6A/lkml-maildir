While you could avoid zero'ing them out, you certainly can't avoid
reading them into the cpu caches.
And for the PGDs you have to initialize these things partially to
non-zero values on x86{,_64} on every new PGD you allocate, which is a
complete waste of cpu cache dirtying.  Avoiding this overhead alone
justifies the quicklists I think.  It's not just a "zero" thing,
so GFP_ZERO cannot help you here.
The more I think about it the more I like the quicklists.
