Pointers are still 32 bits on x86, and the visible address space for
any particular process is still somewhat less than 4G.
I believe that if you select Linux on Alpha that you can have more than 4G
per process, but that may or may not be true.
What the support for >4G of memory on x86 is about, is the "PAE", Page Address
Extension, supported on P6 generation of machines, as well as on Athlons
(I think).  With these, the kernel can use >4G of memory, but it still can't
present a >32bit address space to user processes.  But you could have 8G
physical RAM and run 4 ~2G or 2 ~4G processes simultaneously in core.
There may or may not be some way to support an abomination like the old "far"
pointers in DOS (multiple 4G segments), but I don't think it has been written
yet.
