Subject: [PATCH] Input: atkbd - broaden the Dell DMI signatures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/29/168

Some Dells need the dell input quirk applied but have a different vendor
string in their DMI tables. Add an extra entry to cover these machines as
well.

Dmitry, any chance of getting this queued for .29? Probably suitable for 
-stable as well.
