Only the first time.

OK, it seems to me there's an IO delay here: The first time I reply to a message, 
there is a continuous, steady and light disk load since I press the Reply button 
until the message appears. There are no pauses or delays. 
 
If I close the message window and then click Reply again, the window opens up 
almost immediately. Also, if I exit Evolution completely (shut it down and run "killev" 
to kill wombat and friends), and then open it up again, the Reply message procedure 
is also immediate.

Maybe I did not express myself correctly in my previous message: there are no such 
delays. Since the moment I click Reply for the very first time until the window opens up, 
there is no disk idle time.

I have done so: Evolution is a complex application with many interdependencies and is 
not very prone to launch diagnostic messages to the console. Anyways, I haven't seen 
any diagnostic message in the console. I still think there is something in the AS I/O scheduler 
that is not working at full read throughput. Of course I'm no expert. 
 
Thanks!
