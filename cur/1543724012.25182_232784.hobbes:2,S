If you mean how do you get source code to the openais project without
bk, it is available as a nightly tarball download from
developer.osdl.org:
http://developer.osdl.org/cherry/openais
If you want to contribute to openais, you can still contribute by using
diff by sending patches to:
openais@lists.osdl.org
