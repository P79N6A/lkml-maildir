Subject: [PATCH] kill an obsolete sub-thread-ptrace stuff
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There is a couple of subtle checks which were needed to handle ptracing from
the same thread group. This was deprecated a long ago, imho this code just
complicates the understanding.
And, the "->parent->signal->flags & SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT" check in exit_notify()
is not right. SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT can mean exec(), not exit_group(). This means
ptracer can lose a ptraced zombie on exec(). Minor problem, but still the bug.
