I wrote a little test program the other day as well, and experimented with the 
same thing. For interest's sake, my results were as follows.
Interesting to note the differences in time that the operations took. Also, 
although the creation on reiserfs is extremely quick, the unlinking seems to 
be a lot more expensive -- deleting those 1m directories took well over 10 
minutes.
