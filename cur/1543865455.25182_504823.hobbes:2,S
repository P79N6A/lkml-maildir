I think it's bogus.  If the quantity being copied here is more than 32-bits
then yes, a lock is appropriate.  But if it's a single word then it's
unlikely that the locking does anything useful.  Or there might be a bug
here.

Maintaining a byte count isn't related to maintaining a list.

If a sleeping lock is being used as a mutex, please use a mutex.  We prefer
that semaphores only be used in those situations where their counting
feature is being used.
Reasons: a) mutexes have better runtime debugging support and b) Ingo had
some plans to reimplement semaphores in an arch-neutral way and for some
reason reducing the number of callers would help that.  I forget what the
reason was, actually.

How about kernel/kfifo.c?
