I agree, but it seemed like the most straightforward and architecturally 
cleanest approach to me.

Yes, but it seems a bit awkward.  If we assume that:
   1. Xen will be the only user of the hook, and
   2. Xen-balloon hotplug is exclusive of real memory hotplug
then I guess its reasonable (though if that's the case it would be 
simpler to just put a direct call under #ifdef CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON in there).
But if we think there can be multiple callbacks, and they all get called 
on the online of each page, and there can be multiple kinds of hotplug 
memory it gets pretty messy.  Each has to determine "why was I called on 
this page?" and you'd to work out which one actually does the job of 
onlining.  It just seems cleaner to say "this section needs to be 
onlined like this", and there's no ambiguity.
I'm already anticipating using the ops mechanism to support another 
class of Xen hotplug memory for managing large pages.
