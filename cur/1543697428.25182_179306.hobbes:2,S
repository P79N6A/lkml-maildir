It is a bit different.  If I don't load the module during the boot sequence 
then I can get it to the stage of being pingable.  I think that timing is the 
issue, the boot scripts do everything quickly.  If I modprobe it, then 
ifconfig it, then change the media type, then I have succeeded once in 
getting ping responses, but I couldn't ssh.
