As an interested bystander (and large filesystem user), I'd say I tend to 
agree with Linus and Jeff on this one.
* ext3 is arguably the main Linux filesystem: too important to keep 
  "experimenting" with.
* I'd encourage a >2TB version, but call it ext4.  It makes it clear
  that you are entering new territory.
* Take advantage of the switch to remove some of the backward compatibility
  cruft from the ext4 version -- make it a clean, explicit break.
* [Possibly even inoculate ext3 against creeping featuris and work on 
  cleanup and optimization instead.]
This is not intended to slight the work/position of the ext3 developers,
merely to inform them of an end-user's perspective.
