I haven't looked at swsusp support, but TuxOnIce handles all storage (swap 
partitions, swap files and ordinary files) by first allocating swap (if we're 
using swap), then bmapping the storage we're going to use. After that, we can 
freeze filesystems and processes with impunity. The allocated storage is then 
viewed as just a collection of bdevs, each with an ordered chain of extents 
defining which blocks we're going to read/write - a series of tapes if you 
like. In the image header, we store dev_ts and the block chains, together 
with the configuration information. As long as the same bdevs are configured 
at boot time prior to the echo > /sys/power/resume, we're in business. 
Filesystems don't need to be mounted because we don't use filesystem code 
anyway. (LVM etc does though in so far as it's needed to make the dev_t match 
the device again).
This matches with what you said above about hibernating to swap files and 
dedicated hibernation files - TuxOnIce uses exactly the same code to do the 
i/o to both; the variation is in the code to recognise the image header and 
allocate/free/bmap storage.
<not a filesystem expert> Personally, I don't think ext[34] is broken. If 
there's data being left in the journal that will need replaying, then 
mounting without replaying the journal sounds wrong. Perhaps you should 
instead be arguing that nothing should be left in the journal after a 
filesystem freeze. But, of course, current code isn't doing a filesystem 
freeze (just a process freeze) and the kexec guys want to take even that 
away. </not a filesystem expert>
In short, I agree. AFAICS, you need both the process freezer and filesystem 
freezing to make this thing fly properly.
