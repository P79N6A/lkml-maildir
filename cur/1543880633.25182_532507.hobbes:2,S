I very much appreciate your continued work on SD.
Over the last days I had used 26.21-rc7-ck1 and -ck2. Today I have
given sd0.42 a try and my system "feels" more responsive with my
everyday tasks. No hard facts just my very subjective usage experience.
I'm on an Intel Core2 T7600 2.33GHz, 4GB, openSUSE 10.2, KDE
Workload are occasional compilejobs as well as regular Perl
numbercrunching scripts while having amarok playing music.
No noticeable desktop freezes or anything else. With -ck1/2 I had
occasional visual freezes/delays.
I think I still like SD better than the "old" -ck.
I'll give 2.6.21-rc7-sd0.43 a try later today (i.e. when it has
finished been built).
Best,
Michael
