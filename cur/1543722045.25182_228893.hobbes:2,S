Sam's point is that unless you ask KBUILD to put the kernel build in a 
separate directory to its sources (this is not the default 
behaviour), /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build will still point to the mixture of 
source and build data, therefore no breakage will occur.
I understand Sam's reasoning and I believe it is sensible to have the source 
and build output in separate directories within /lib/modules/`uname -r`. The 
drivers in question can easily be updated to support the exceptional case 
whereby users build kernels in a different directory to the source.
Sam, maybe if there was a way to easily detect whether a kernel had been build 
with or without a different output directory, it would be easier to have 
vendors take this change on board. For example, I imagine in the typical case 
whereby no change in build directory is made, you will have something like 
this:
/lib/modules/2.6.7/build -> /home/alistair/linux-2.6
/lib/modules/2.6.7/source -> /home/alistair/linux-2.6
Whereas when O is given, it will instead be like this:
/lib/modules/2.6.7/build -> /home/alistair/my-dir
/lib/modules/2.6.7/source -> /home/alistair/linux-2.6
I presume that checking for the existence of /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source 
will be enough.
#
# where's the kernel source?
#
if [ -d /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source ]; then
	# 2.6.8 and newer
	KERNDIR="/lib/modules/`uname -r`/source"
else
	# pre 2.6.8 kernels
	KERNDIR="/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build"
fi
Yeah?
