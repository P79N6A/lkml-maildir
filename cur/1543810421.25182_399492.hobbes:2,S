No, I did not.
I CCed fsdevel originally in part because other clustered/distributed
filesystems developers are likely to read lkml or fsdevel and might share their
opinions about the patch and the approach itself.
Actually I am not sure if any other non-local filesystem tries to be as close
to local fs in semantic as Lustre does.
