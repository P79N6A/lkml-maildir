It's an issue when it MIGHT be important.  Such as, fprintf to an important
data file should be checked, fprintf to stderr is usually cool not to check.
People are going on the assumption that ignoring an error to a system call
will interfere with program operation or corrupt data - which is NOT
necessarily true.  Sure many people write programs that way.  But it is
quite often that if something fails, you don't particularly care, and you
know, with certainty, that it does not materially affect the operation of
your program.  For instance, should shutdown fail just because it couldn't
write a message to everyone's console?  That would be wonderful.
Administrator wants to shut down system because it is broken - but since a
programmer follows your mantras, the system CANNOT
successfully shutdown anyway because then it wouldn't be "reliable".
