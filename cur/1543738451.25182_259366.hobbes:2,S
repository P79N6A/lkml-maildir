I was wondering if anybody could help me with a hint or two...
I'm trying to add a sub-directory to each /proc/[number] directory
(where [number] is a process id). I think that I need to get a
proc_dir_entry* so that I can call:
proc_mkdir("mysubdir", (struct proc_dir_entry *) parent);
However, I can't work out how to get a reference to the proc_dir_entry*
I need. I can find the other entries in the proc directory (such as bus,
cpuinfo. misc, net...) by doing something like this:
struct proc_dir_entry * dp;
dp = &proc_root;
dp = dp->subdir;
while (dp != NULL) {
  printk("er... found: %s\n",dp->name);
  dp = dp->next;
}
However, the only entries that don't show up are the [number] entries.
Assistance please!
