Greetings,
 I have a problem making a linux kernel on a i586 machine.
When i type: make zImage, the makefile fails to link the object files
related to the image file compression(misc.o,piggy.c... located at
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/compressed) and then abort the whole
making process.
I get 3 messages about undefined references in misc.o in function
fill_inbuff.
There are only 2 variables on that function that are undefined, but ld
reply with 3 messages since one of that variables appears two times
within the fucntion.
I take a look on the source code of misc.c and try to see where the
variables are declared, and they are declared as follow:
extern char input_data;
extern int input_len;
These are the variables that the linker complains about.
I am using a RH4.1 , kernel 2.0.27 and a i586 platform.
Any ideas about this problem?
Thanks,
Carlos Sousa - c9702056@cca.fc.up.pt
