No problem. Fortunately, this part of the code is *very well* documented :-)

Yes, but only if there's an ACK and the ACK is exactly equal to snd_next,
so the connection will survive.

No, there are plenty of ways to kill TCP connections when you can guess
the window (which is more and more easy thanks to window scaling). But
I have yet found no way to kill a TCP session without this info, except
by exploiting the simultaneous connect feature.
My point was that it would not be too difficult to remotely prevent an
anti-virus or IDS from downloading its updates when you know the update
site's address and you know that by default it uses source ports
1024-4999 to connect outside. I don't really care for BGP however
because people should use MD5 or they get what they deserve.
Cheers,
Willy
