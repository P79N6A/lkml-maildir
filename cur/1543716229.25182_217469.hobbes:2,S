Ah, thanks for the description.
2.6 has a problem with NFS filesystems that would cause symptoms
like yours. I'm not sure whether 2.4 has something similar or not.
You can probably expect a fix for 2.6.6 but I'm not sure if there
is a patch that has been agreed upon yet.
In short, there probably isn't much point testing 2.6 right now.
