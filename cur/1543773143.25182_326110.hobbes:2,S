I thought about putting in font instead of the tail too.
But then I also thought this after all is truncate that will literally
free some ram, and in turn it'll delay the VM shrinking a bit (i.e.
kswapd will stop shortly after truncate started). Plus there's no reason
to assume kswapd was running when truncate was invoked.
So overall I think the basic idea is to move it in the inactive list and
to strip the referenced bit, either at the head or tail probably doesn't
make much difference, they have opposite pros/cons.
The front sounds conceptually safer even if tail probably works better
in practice.
