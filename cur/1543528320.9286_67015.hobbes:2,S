 The frequency is different on various systems.  So far, I've seen at
least 30 MHz, 33 MHz and 66 MHz.  I believe 25 MHz, 50 MHz and 60 MHz are
also possible as well as a variety of others on i486 based systems.

 Actually it's the local APIC clock that gets calibrated and the local
APIC timer ticks basing on this clock source.  This timer interrupt is
used for scheduling so it'd better be constant across systems.

 As a source of the system time tick.  We could probably use the RTC
periodic interrupt instead, but HZ got fixed at 100 on i386 long time ago
and the best approximation we can get from the RTC is 128 ;-) as it only
allows powers of 2.  Alphas use 1024 for HZ so they do not suffer from
this problem.
