The only concern I have with a userspace solution is that you run the risk of
losing that data.  What happens if a process on the box drives drives it out
of memory and paging space?  The box would still be working, it just wouldn't
be able to fork new processes, and those already running that aren't purposely
made high priority may not get much of a chance to execute as well.  I've lost
SAR data that way.
