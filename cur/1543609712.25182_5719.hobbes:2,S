Yes, well, the problem is more serious than that, since formatting the
windows partition will write unwanted stuff to my main linux partition
as well. This partition is 17GB, but less than 3GB is used. Unless
reiserfs writes stuff all over the place, there shouldn't be data
anywhere near the end of this partition. 
Anyway, I don't want to kill off random files on my linux partition if
there is some other way to test this.
BTW, sfdisk -l -x /dev/hda says:
Disk /dev/hda: 3736 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors/track
Units = cylinders of 8225280 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, counting from
