I guess this is the PowerNOW! feature of the mobile Athlons/Durons with
the Palomino core. I think this is totaly different than STPGNT. And this
would be worth implementing if it can be supported on desktop Athlon/Duron
models/mobos.
Anybody has more info about this?

True. Although an tv tunner card output on screen tells the tale pretty

I hope everybody could see it this way.
