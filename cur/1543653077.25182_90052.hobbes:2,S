Odd.
charon:~% grep -c 623 /etc/services
0

WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS
The Well Known Ports are controlled and assigned by the IANA and on
most systems can only be used by system (or root) processes or by
programs executed by privileged users.

ginad           634/udp    ginad
I don't see port 623 in there.  Where is this documented?
