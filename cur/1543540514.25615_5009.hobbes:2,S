Basically, it's apparently normal behaviour to time out even with a real
keyboard. Also, the code made the "oh, I forgot the keyboard, let's plug
it in later" case not work, I think.
I forget who made the specific report, but I think Ingo Molnar was one of
the people who complained about the "stop trying after the first failure"
patch..
