OK not really - i've tested the new kernel on all models. And it works 
fine... the DN state only comes sometimes - absolutely not reproducable. 
So my tests went OK and then we've done the update. I've now seen 5 
servers in 7 days having this problem.

Sorry what key is sysrq? Can i also do this via SSH Console?

Problem here is that it is not reproducable...
