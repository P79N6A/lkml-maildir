Hi,
Is it legal to call general_make_request() more than once on the same bh?
What will happen if a previous request is still in the queue, or just
initiated but not finished yet?  If I call general_make_request() on the
same buffer 10 times, does it mean the same buffer will *always* be
written 10 times on the disk?
Thanks for any enlightment!
