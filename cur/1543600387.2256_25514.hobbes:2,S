127.0.0.2 is not local on any of my systems. The only exceptions
are some Linux boxen that I did not ask to do so.
I welcome suggestions, maybe even code fragments, that will allow
an MTA to correctly recognize user@[ip.address] as local, as required
by the SMTP RFC.

It is perfectly OK for an MTA to make a distinction between local
subnets and the rest of the Internet.
I welcome suggestions, maybe even code fragments, that will allow
an MTA to correctly recognize the subnetworks that the machine is
attached to.
