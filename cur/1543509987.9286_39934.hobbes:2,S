Woops, I missed that. If so I propose also this incremental patch to
improve the scalability of the code:
--- 2.3.18ac6/include/net/sock.h	Mon Sep 20 18:06:40 1999
+++ /tmp/sock.h	Mon Sep 20 20:10:49 1999

There must be a (SMP) race somewhere as I had a soft deadlock with process
hanging in these three functions:
c016d09b <tcp_listen_wlock+1a7/254>
c0164ec1 <tcp_data_wait+1b9/274>
c0154527 <__lock_sock+16f/1fc>
Now I believe the race is in the tcp_lhash_* things but I had a look at
them and I couldn't find anything wrong. I'll try again...
