Hi,
why are the maintenance releases (2.6.x.y -- those with a .y in their
version number) not stored in the git tree accessible via
rsync://rsync1.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/?
(Or -- are they, and I'm just not seeing them because I'm looking at the
wrong corner in the .git/ subdirectory?)
Shouldn't these minor changes be maintained in a branch for each
sublevel release? Or, if there's a reason not to do so, where is the
place they're being maintained at besides the main download locations
for patches?
Kind regards,
 Horst
