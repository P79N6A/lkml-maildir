Well, no pointer but the same effect with 2.4.15pre7 and romfs (as posted
earlier to the list). It seems initrd handling is fs type picky :-(
Just to repeat myself:
1. the romfs initrd is fine, loop mounting it works.
2. the romfs initrd is detected at boot time.
3. the romfs initrd is not root mounted at boot time, thus without a root fs
   the kernel panics.
4. Doing the same with an ext2 initrd works fine.
Not really nice for systems where the only reason ext2 is compiled in the kernel
is this initrd behaviour.
