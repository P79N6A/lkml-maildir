Thanks, I am all patched up and ready to test, unfortunately one of my disks
in my RAID 1 just died, I already filled out the advanced replacement form,
I will test when I receive the replacement disk.
p34:~# lilo
Fatal: Not all RAID-1 disks are active; use '-H' to install to active disks only
p34:~# lilo -H
Warning: Partial RAID-1 install on active disks only; booting is not failsafe
Warning: Faulty disk in RAID-1 array; boot with caution!!
Fatal: Unusual RAID bios device code: 0xFF
p34:~#
Don't feel like mucking up my system at the moment.
Justin.
