You're then saying that a process cannot set VM_DONTCOPY on a VM_IO
area to prevent the first child getting the area, but clear it after
so the next child does get a copy of the area.  I think it'd be wrong
(surprising) to limit the functionality in that way.

I don't much want to add another path into copy_pte_range, actually
copying pages.  If the process really wants DMA into such areas,
then it should contain the code for the child to COW them itself?
