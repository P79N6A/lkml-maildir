Well, our choices basically are:
1)  Force a filesystem error
2)  Sleep and retry the allocation
3)  Don't add the freed blocks to the list regions that mballoc should
    be allowed to allocate from after the transaction commits.  This 
    results in the blocks getting "leaked" until the filesystem is
    mounted/unounted.
