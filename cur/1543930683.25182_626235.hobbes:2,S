And I may remind you that I have participated in this discussion before
and made my points clear there. I suppose I should remind you how the
development process works? Just because I happen to maintain some piece
of code does not mean I'm under some sort of contractual obligation to
fix and write new code for users. I'll happily review patches and
integrate stuff I agree with, as I have been doing for years. This bug
may seem really important to you - guess what, that's the normal nature
of a bug to a user that runs into them.

Please, I'm not flaming you. I reviewed your code and pointed out
errors, which was followed by lots of hand waving on your side instead
of just sitting down and reading/fixing the bug.
