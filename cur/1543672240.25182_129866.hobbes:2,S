I'd recommend running 2.4 and getting the latest i2c and lmsensors code
from the lmsensors web site.  Then run the sensors-detect script which
will try to safely determine what kind of hardware you have, and what
drivers you need.
If after doing that, it says you have the adm1021 and lm75 chips and
they work properly on 2.4, please let me know and I'll try to track down
what's changed on 2.5.
Hope this helps,
