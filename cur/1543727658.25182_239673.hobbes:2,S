It's fine.
It oopses on
	inode->i_sb->s_op
where "i_sb" is bad and contains the pointer "0x0b7eebf8" which is 
definitely not a valid kernel pointer.
There's a few other strange details in your oops report too. One being 
that the inode pointer (in %ebx, apparently) doesn't show on the stack 
where I'd expect it to show. Hmm. That might be just a different compiler 
issue, though.
Anyway, this does look somewhat like the ones Gene is seeing. If I had to 
guess, I'd guess that either the inode pointer is bad, or it's just stale 
from an inode that has already been free'd. Most likely because of 
prune_dcache() having had a corrupt LRU list with a stale/corrupt entry.
That would blow the prefetch theory out of the water.
