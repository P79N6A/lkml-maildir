I have made a small patch for the atmel driver [included in the 2.6.18
kernel] to output signal strength information as part of iwlist scan
[before it did not output any signal strength related information].

The output of iwlist scan is frequently used by user space utilites to
chose which wireless network to connect to based on the reported
signal strength, so I think this could be useful [of course I could be
horribly wrong about that but *shrugs*]. Incase the patch gets mangled
I've also put it up on at
http://www.holdenkarau.com/~holden/projects/atmel/patches/001-iwlist-stats.patch
