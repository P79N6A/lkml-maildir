As does memclear_highpage_flush().  Some of my code looks like:
void some_func(...)
{
	if (foo)
		return do_foo(...);
	if (bar)
		return do_bar(...);
	...
}
do_foo() and do_bar() also return void.  Saves an extra line for the
return statment and the brackets.
Doesn't help in the code you quoted, of course.
