First of all, fix your mail software and/or account information.

There is a divider that gives an approximately 18.2 Hz clock.
Linux resets this to get approximately 100 Hz.
The original PC used a video standard crystal. The divider was set
to give approximately 65536 ticks per hour, which made it easy to
detect an hour change. The BIOS needed to update something hourly.
DOS was designed to use this. DOS timekeeping was poor because it
didn't get a perfectly even number of ticks in an hour. After video
cards switched to other clock sources, the frequency could be adjusted
to make everything come out perfect. Now the clock is often made to
agree with what used to be just an approximation used by the BIOS.
This isn't a very big difference of course. (14.316558 vs. 14.31818)
DOS would use an "hour" of 3599.592 seconds with the old frequency.
Linux seems to assume a frequency of 14.31816 -- none of the above.
Only one way to resolve this: somebody measure a few thousand modern
computers from different vendors, years, and production runs.
