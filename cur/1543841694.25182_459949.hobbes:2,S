Although this is really a trivial patch, it would be nice if you can
sign your patch (on our wiki you can have more info about patch
submission procedure:
http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/How_to_submit_patches
). Basically,
you should send at the email a line with:
	Signed-off-by: Your name <name@yoursite.com>
Also, it would be nice if you add a comment above the new entry at vicam
PCI table a short comment describing the new device, like, for example:
/* Compro PS39U */
