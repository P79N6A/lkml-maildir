Dunno if this is already reported (since I'm not on the list, too high
traffic volume for me), no mention of this problem in any 2.2.13 errata I
found at least. I'm getting this sequence of messages flooding
my kernel log on my poor 386/33 ISDN router:
Oct 21 21:09:54 nightrunner kernel: isdn_ppp_skb_push:under 4 5
Oct 21 21:09:54 nightrunner kernel: isdn_ppp_skb_push:under 0 2
Oct 21 21:09:54 nightrunner kernel: isdn_ppp_skb_push:under 0 2
The connection seems to work ok but floods this sequence _fast_ into the
logs so since the machine is on the trailing edge of tech it's too slow to
be usable. Kernel is vanilla 2.2.13, ISDN adapter is a Teles 16.0. Works
perfectly under 2.2.12 and as described under 2.2.13.
Card config (although I suppose it doesn't matter in this case):
HiSax: Teles 16.0 config irq:5 mem:0xD0000 cfg:0xD80
Contact me if more info is needed or you have a patch for me to try
(although don't expect a fast reply to patch tests, takes some 402min to
compile kernel on this poor thing ;)
Thanks in advance. (Please reply directly or cc to me since I'm not on the
list.)
