Hello,
I've read the /usr/src/linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt file, but one
doubt still remain in my mind. I remember seeing here in the list some
code excerpts as the following example (ficticious, of course):
      movl   0x5c(%ecx),%ecx
      movl   %ecx,0x14(%esp,1)
      movl   (%ecx),%eax
  EQUIVALENT_C_CODE();
      movl   0x5c(%ecx),%ecx
      movl   %ecx,0x14(%esp,1)
      movl   (%ecx),%eax
  EQUIVALENT_C_CODE();
(...)
How can you get that, especially from a module? Is there a program that
does that for you?? If positive, how to do it?
TIA and Regards,
Ivan
