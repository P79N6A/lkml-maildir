All chipsets are supported by piix.c driver but:
* we depend on BIOS to program correct PIO timings and set drives
  (mpiix chipset)
* PIO tuning code is buggy and needs fixing (oldpiix chipsets)
I don't think that this alone justify adding new drivers instead of fixing
old one as both issues can be fixed quite easily by almost cut'n'pasting
new tuning code from Alan's drivers and adding it to piix.c.
