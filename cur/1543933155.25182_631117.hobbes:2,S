Well the information that would be exposed in /proc/slabinfo would only be 
faked up stuff from SLUB. The queues that are described in /proc/slabinfo do not 
exist f.e. (tunables do not make sense) and there are more details available via /sys/kernel/slab.
There is a discussion on linux-mm with some of the people working on tools 
to make these to use the information that SLUB provides.
