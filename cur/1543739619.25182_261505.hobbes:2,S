Hi.
I sent this yesterday, but seems like it missed the list somehow :
  There are several assembly 'helpers' in arch/i386/semaphore.c, for
example, __up_wakeup. __up_wakeup's purpose is to call C function:
asmlinkage void __up(struct semaphore *sem)
this is how it does it:
	pushl %eax
	pushl %edx
	pushl %ecx
	call __up
	popl %ecx
	popl %edx
	popl %eax
  As one can see, actual parameter in %ecx is not only being copied in
formal parameter sem (which is correct), but also being restored from it
after function call via %ecx (which is incorrect). Since formal
parameter is not a constant one, it may be overwritten inside C
function, or gcc may (and in fact does that in some cases) use it for
something else.
If we want to keep %ecx, correct behavior would be
	pushl %ecx
	pushl %ecx
	call _up
	add $4, %ecx
	popl %ecx
Above applies for other functions in semaphore.c in latest 2.6 kernels.
2.4 might also be affected.
Thanks,
Aleks.
