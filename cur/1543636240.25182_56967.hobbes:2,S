I poked around in the bios for any APIC settings or OS settings, and 
found none.  I also couldn't find any configuration utilities that would 
let me change any of those settings.  While playing around in the 
diagnostics that are included with the server, I did find that it failed 
an MP test.  That would explain rather nicely why it isn't working. 
I'll have to convince the boss to let me spend more money now, since 
even if I can get it booting, I don't want to be running a server with 
buggy hardware.  Unless you're interested in getting the kernel to boot 
on this thing, I'm not going to pursue this any further.  Thanks for 
your help.
