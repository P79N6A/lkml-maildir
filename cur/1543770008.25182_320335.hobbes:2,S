from a theoretical POV, this categorization into 'preempt critical' vs.  
'preempt-noncritical' sections is pretty arbitrary too.
from a practical POV the amount of code that is non-preemptible is not 
controllable under CONFIG_PREEMPT. So the end-result is that 
CONFIG_PREEMPT is just as nondeterministic.
polling need_resched after reaching a zero preempt_count() is ugly 
(doing cond_resched() in might_sleep() is ugly too) - pretty much the 
only difference is overhead.

yes, and that's what matters. It's just a single #ifdef in kernel.h, and 
at least one major distribution would make use of it because it 
significantly improves soft-RT latencies at a minimal cost. We can 
remove it if it's not being used, but right now the only choice that 
distributions have is no preemption or full-blown CONFIG_PREEMPT. Ask 
the kernel maintainers at SuSE why they havent enabled CONFIG_PREEMPT in 
their kernels.
