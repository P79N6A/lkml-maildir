Yes, kernel memory is never swapped out. But my point is merely that as 
far as I know there is no special handling in the copy_to/from_user 
functions to handle the case where the userspace memory is swapped out, 
and therefore this would not be an issue for accessing the memory 
directly. Obviously this is not something that one should actually do, 
since access faults are not trapped and on some architectures or 
configurations it won't work at all.
