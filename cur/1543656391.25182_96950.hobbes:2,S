Let me counter this, I have to admit that I didn't try the patch yet, but
my laptop does S4 BIOS, and I'd definitely prefer that to swsusp, since
it's much faster and also I somewhat have more faith into S4 BIOS than
swsusp (as in: after resuming, it'll most likely either work or crash, but
not cause any weird kinds of corruption). Since it does not need not much
more to support it than S3, I don't see why you wouldn't want to give
users the option?
