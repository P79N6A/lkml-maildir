I notice that the .git/hooks/post-update still calls it
"git-update-server-info".  Shouldn't that be "git
update-server-info"?
[my git is 1.6.0.2, but even on a checked out though not
compiled-and-installed 1.6.0.4 it is the same]

Maybe git bundle can help.  Perhaps there can be some
documented way of creating a HTTP-downloadable bundle from
the current "master" in any web-accessible git to make
things really easy for first time downloaders, maybe updated
only once in a month or so.  Anyone having trouble doing a
clone would get this, fetch it in, set up remote/origin, and
then do a normal pull...
