    the message doesn't appear anymore, but installing is giving me
    the following:
    <-- snip -->
    Setting up kbd (1.10-1) ...
    Looking for keymap to install:
    de-latin1-nodeadkeys
    cannot open file de-latin1-nodeadkeys
    Loading /etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz
    <-- snap -->
I suppose by default you would find these under
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwertz/de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/mac/all/mac-de-latin1-nodeadkeys.map.gz

    showkey -s is giving me exactly the same:
    <-- snip -->
    atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed
    <-- snap -->
That is a kernel message, not showkey output.
(BTW - which kernel precisely? The message is not the 2.6.0 one.)
Maybe showkey -s never sees them?
