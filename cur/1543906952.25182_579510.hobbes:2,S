Foreword: I'm the OP of bug #7372. 
I just want to say/add that:
 1) I'm running the per-bdi patch since about 30 days on a master mysql server
under somewhat mild load without any adverse effect I could notice.
 2) I _still_ don't get the "performances" of 2.6.17, but since that's the
better combination I could get, I think there is IMHO progress in the right
direction (to be compared to no progress since 2.6.18, that's better :-)).
To be honest, a vanilla 2.6.17 not tuned at all (ie vfs_cache_pressure and other
knobs in /proc/sys/vm like swappiness and dirty_*) is still better than any
other upcoming kernel I tested. Thus I still think 2.6.18 added a big regression
(which unfortunately I couldn't find).
Read the full bug report for any background information if needed.
Unfortunately it isn't practical to git-bisect my issue as the server is a
production server that can't be rebooted/stopped whenever I want (and since I
found workarounds of the issue...).
Thanks for showing interest in this issue.
