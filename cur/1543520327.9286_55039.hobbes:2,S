In May/June of this year, there was quite a bit of soul-searching 
about what kernel version and patches provided the best performing SMP 
Apache foundation (see 
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html
). Now 
that six months have passed by and kernels 2.2.13 / 2.3.33 are 
available, what is the current answer to the question: what is the 
best combination of kernel source and patches to provide a stable, 
hi-performance webserver for Apache in a dual P3/500, 1G ram 
environment?
If you wouldn't mind terribly, I'd like a direct cc: reply to
