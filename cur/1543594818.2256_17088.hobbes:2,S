(i) today this is dead code
(ii) I am slowly restructuring all blockdev code, mainly with
the purpose of freeing partition code from the bowels of the
various drivers. In the process register_disk()
changes prototype, and grok_partitions() disappears.
For example, patch 06 that I made an hour or so ago
deletes the "minors" parameter of both. What, if anything,
will be reinserted later will be rather different from what
is there today. Indeed, these cdrom drivers do not need a
register_disk().
