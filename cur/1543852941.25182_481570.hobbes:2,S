Undoubtedly this change in behavior is caused by the "autostop" code I 
added to ohci-hcd.  It doesn't check the "wakeup" attribute.
Dave, is there any clue about exactly what triggers the immediate wakeup?  
If you could tell me what to test for, I could try writing a patch to fix 
it.  Perhaps the driver needs a "resume_detect_is_broken" quirk.
Andrey, if you aren't using USB at all (you mentioned that no devices were 
plugged in), you can simply do "rmmod ohci-hcd" to stop all those log 
messages.
