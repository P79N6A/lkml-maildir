I'm working on the virtual machine monitor for FreeMWare
(open source project like VMWare) initially for Linux.
Essentially I'm creating a mini-OS-like monitor which
runs in a "parallel world" as Linux.  It's pretty funky
and the logic goes something like this.  During a user
process's time quantum, I call an ioctl() into a
kernel module I wrote, which changes over to a completely
different set of mappings {GDT, IDT, TR, ...} and
runs a virtualized guest OS over there during the time slice.
The monitor doesn't handle hardware interrupts itself,
as FreeMWare doesn't talk to real hardware.  What
I need to do is to redirect any hardware interrupts
from my monitor IDT handler back to Linux, which they
were originally destined for.
So I switch everything back over to Linux mappings upon
hardware interrupt.  I have in hand the IRQ# and vector of
the interrupt.  How do you recommend I call interrupt handlers
in the Linux kernel from my kernel module, given I have these
parameters?
I need the handlers to think they were called as a result of
a real hardware interrupt, and not know about the software
intervention of the virtual machine monitor of FreeMWare.
Much appreciated
