fd = shm_open("vidmem-filename", O_CREAT,...);
ftruncate(fd, 1<<20);
ptr = mmap(0, 64 * 1<<10, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
to remap another area:
if (mmap(ptr, 64 * 1<<10, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED|MAP_FIXED, 
         fd, blocknr * 64 * 1<<10) != ptr)
        error();
On exit:
munmap(ptr, 64 * 1<<10);
shm_unlink ("vidmem-filename");
Note the MAP_FIXED argument to the remap operation. You do not need to
unmap on Linux to remap an area when giving MAP_FIXED. (So MAP_FIXED
can to really bad things to your program...)
