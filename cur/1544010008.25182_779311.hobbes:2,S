I explained...
One example was mmap_sem. above one is recursive lock in cpuset you tried to fix.
(Fortunately, cpuset's subsys ID is smaller than memcg's one. you'll not see
 in real environment.)
And there are other unknown subsyses are planned, bio, checkpoint, etc..
Could you write a document to explain what kind of nest of locks are allowed
before merging this ?
