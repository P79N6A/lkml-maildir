My system is top (ppp1-14.sj.netmagic.net).  The destination system
is home (home.worldcontrol.com).
Both are 2.2.15pre9 Linux systems running on AMD K6/3-400's with 128MB.
top is connected via dialup PPP connection over a 28.8 pcmcia modem.
home has an ADSL link with an Alcatel 1000 ADSL "modem".
In case one, I bringup the PPP connection and do
brian@top brian>scp comments1 home:
comments1                 |         65 KB |  32.7 kB/s | ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%
The scp job hangs at this point, and so does the PPP session.  No more
packets go back or forth, and after some lcp echo packet timeouts the
PPP session disconnects. (The blinky lights on wmppp are not blinking,
I might expect to see a blink every 10 seconds due to the lcp echo packets,
by even they don't show up).
In case two, I bringup the PPP connection and send an email to
and address at home.  qmail spawns a 'qmail-remote' to deliver the
message and after some activity qmail-remote becomes stuck and no
more data goes back or forth on the connection.  After a minute
or so the lcp echo packet timeouts cause the PPP session to drop
connection. (same behavior as above with the blinky lights of wmppp).
I've attached (gzip'ed) the 'tcpdump -i ppp0' logs of the each
test.
My pcmcia system is 3.1.11 and the pppd is from 2.3.11.
In tried my wifes system (Linux 2.2.15pre9 w/ISA Rockwell based
56K modem) using the same phone line and PPP account.  All worked
fine.
The only differences I can think of:
top:   Redhat 6.1 w/2.2.15pre9
       pcmcia modem
home:  Redhat 6.0 w/2.2.15pre9
       ADSL Alcatel 1000
laura: Redhat 6.0 w/2.2.15pre9
       ISA modem
