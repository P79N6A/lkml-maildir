Sometime back, Linus has pointed a race regading d_lookup and concurrent
d_move (rename). If lookup moves to a different bucket due to d_move, it may
fail the lookup. rename in the same directory is protected by parent's i_sem
but rename in some unrelated directory on the same hash chain can have
this problem. This can result in real_lookup allocating a new dentry for an
existing one.
Now, similar problem is there with lookup_hash()->cached_lookup(), where
lookup_hash() ends up in allocating a duplicate dentry.
Linus, actually fixed the race in real_lookup using dcache_lock around the
d_lookup call. The patch I posted replaces this with seqlock and also fixes
the cached_lookup() case.
