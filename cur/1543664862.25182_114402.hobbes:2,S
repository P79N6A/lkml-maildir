Do not use TOPDIR.

Is preferred.

There is no need to use the symlink trick.
Just pass the architecture as first mandatory parameter.
Something like
checkstack: vmlinux FORCE
	$(OBJDUMP) -d vmlinux | scripts/checkstack.pl $(ARCH)
Note that I skipped grep. Perl is good at regular expressions, and
the perl scripts already know the architecture so you can do the job there.
Since the above is now architecture independent, better locate it in
the top level Makefile.
