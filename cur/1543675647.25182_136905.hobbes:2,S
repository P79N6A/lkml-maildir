Um, no, I just never upgraded my kernel since 2.4.20-pre5-ac1. At that time,
ide-scsi didn't work in the -ac series, and Andre Hedrick had initially
released his patches for it to work.
I recommend sticking with the latest -ac version regardless. :) It has most of
Andre's patches in anyway, with everything else fixed--except for this one
problem.
