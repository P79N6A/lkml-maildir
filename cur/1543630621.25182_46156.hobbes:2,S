Hi Ion,
Thanks for the answer :)

I am using dhcp from time to time, but the card drops its ip when it is
allocated statically as well :(
However, it *does* seem to drop its ip more frequently if I am using
dhcp, or between usage of  dhcp and a reboot (I normally just use
suspend) so this might be the case. I will monitor this a bit closer...

Can't seem to load that module I'm afraid..

Thank you very much for your help anyway.
