We use ACPI on AMD64 so you should be parsing the ACPI tables not trying
to rely on legacy interfaces which if I rememeber the spec rightly aren't
even guaranteed safe to call when ACPI is active.
What are you actually trying to achieve.

Assuming you even have a BIOS - you may have EFI underlying or
Linuxbios or be a virtual machine.
