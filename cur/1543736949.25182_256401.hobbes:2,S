Subject: sys_* in fs/*.c - need most of it for fsproxy module!

hi,
i'm writing an fsproxy module.
so far i have pretty much cut/paste the entire contents of the following
functions - unmodified - into the fsproxy module (based on fuse).
any modifications, if any, are to strip out the top of the function
which does the conversion from userspace memory to kernel memory.
example: i'm just about to cut/paste the entire contents of
sys_unlink... minus the calls to getname and putname.
does anyone have any objections to me creating a patch which would
make the code in sys_unlink, sys_rename, sys_link, sys_this, sys_that,
available from inside the kernel?
l.
