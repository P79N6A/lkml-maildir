Tolerance by who?  As far as I can tell tolerance for binary blobs by
the typical Linux desktop user is higher than ever.  They consider it a
bug if their distro does not automagically install the nvidia/ATI
drivers, and immediately write you off as a GPL zealot if you even
mention that a tainted kernel cannot be debugged.
