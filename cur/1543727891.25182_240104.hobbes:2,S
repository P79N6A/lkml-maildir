I figured you would write to the file (a keyring id?) and it would return 
a key id.

They would contain symlinks to keyring IDs.

No.  The reason for suggesting this was because with a filesystem API, the 
information is already available in userspace, and it would be quite 
simple to enumerate it.  As you said, it's not something that would happen 
all the time, so it's not performance critical.  But if you need a kernel 
API for the same thing, it's a moot point.

No, that would require changes to userspace code.
