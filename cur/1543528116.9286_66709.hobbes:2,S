Not really.  He needs to keep an amount of data on disk.
The organization shouldn't matter that much for performance.  If it
does anyway it means we have a performance problem, or at least
a system unfit for that special case.
Keeping lots of files in a directory is surely a bad idea with ext2.
That don't mean the idea is bad, just that ext2 don't fit that purpose
with its sequential scans.  
Filesystems with b-tree directories have O(log n) performance for
directory
lookup.  An "rm *" which gets O(n^2) complexity in ext2 gets O(n log n)
which is a lot better.  Try reiserfs (or hpfs).  Looking up
or deleting lots of files isn't a problem with that approach.
