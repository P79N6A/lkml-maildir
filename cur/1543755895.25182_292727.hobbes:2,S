Good, it's no bug then. Stephen already explained what's going on: when
a file has xattrs and you delete the file while running a kernel without
xattr support, the xattr block's refcount is not decremented. You end up
with a reference count that is one too high. This won't result in
filesystem corruption, but e2fsck will fix up the refcounts for you.
Those are the mesages you were getting.
