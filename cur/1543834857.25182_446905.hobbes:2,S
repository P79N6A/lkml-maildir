No, this comes up all the time.  Userspace has at least 3 different
mappings to /dev/sda in /dev/disk right now.  Which one do you want the
kernel to use?:
	$ tree /dev/disk/ | grep sda1
	|   |-- scsi-SATA_Maxtor_7L250S0_L59FRPQH_L59FRPQH-part1 -> ../../sda1
	|   |-- boot -> ../../sda1
	    `-- 9c0ef40c-6de9-46f6-ac79-32296c667cf1 -> ../../sda1
Userspace should be doing the reverse mapping if it wants to, the kernel
should not care about this at all.
thanks,
