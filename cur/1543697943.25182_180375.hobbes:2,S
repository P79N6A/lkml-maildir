That amanda vs 2.6 thread was getting verbose.
First, there's a bug in xconfig for 2.6.0-test11, which I just rebuilt 
again.  I had to turn off the VESA_FB with vim, its not an option in 
the xconfig menus.  So this boot is to 2.6.0-test11 with
# CONFIG_FB_VESA is not set
and using the deadline scheduler.
I have started X and logged back out twice, and still had an 
underscore cursor both times, so the disapperaring cursor problem 
seems to be solved.  Many thanks for the hint about framebuffers.
Now, using the deadline scheduler, lets see how an 'su amanda' works:
------------------------
root@coyote linux-2.6]# su amanda  <<<-instant
[amanda@coyote linux-2.6]$ exit
exit
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# su amanda <<<-instant
[amanda@coyote linux-2.6]$ exit
exit
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# su amanda <<<-instant
[amanda@coyote linux-2.6]$ exit
exit
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# su amanda <<<-instant
[amanda@coyote linux-2.6]$ exit
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# su amanda <<<- used ctrl+d to exit
[amanda@coyote linux-2.6]$ exit
[root@coyote linux-2.6]# su amanda <<<- hung, then killed su
Killed
[root@coyote linux-2.6]#
------------------------
So that didn't solve this.
BUT, I just did the whole next amanda snapshot install using 'su 
amanda -c "nameofjob"', after it had refused to do the su amanda by 
itself, and that worked 100% from another, same icon launched, shell 
window.  I'm beginning to think there's something in su thats kernel 
sensitive, and which is bypassed if you give it a job argument.
Am I making any sense at all here?
