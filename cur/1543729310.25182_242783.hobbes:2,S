We check present as well as we free the various parts.  The problem we have
is interfaces exist in "allocated by someone but not present" cases. Right
now the lack of hotplug hides the fact this is totally broken. The unregister
code tries to be smart about this and unregisters only certain bits of the
object if its configured & !present. Thats why I save and use the present
value on entry. 
I've not looked at how it affects SCAN_HWIF but the other seemed ok.
