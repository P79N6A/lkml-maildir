Right, but that's just how it works right now --- one doesn't _have_ to
imply the other.  You could easily imagine an implementation that
implements barriers and flushing separately, and which does not do
automatic flushing on completion of WRITE_BARRIER IOs.  SCSI with
writeback caching enabled might be one example of that.  NBD/DRBD would
be another likely candidate --- if you've got network latencies in the
way, then a flushing sync may be far more expensive than a barrier
propagation.
Unfortunately, a lot of the cases we care about really have to do the
barrier via flushing, so the benefit of keeping them separate is
limited.  For LVM/raid0, for example, we've got no way of preserving
ordering between IOs on different drives, so a flush is necessary there
unless we start journaling the low-level IOs to preserve order.

Right.

Yep.  It scares me to think what performance characteristics we'll start
seeing once that gets used everywhere it's needed, though.  If every raw
or O_DIRECT write needs a flush after it, databases are going to become
very sensitive to flush performance.  I guess disabling the flushing and
using disks which tell the truth about data hitting the platter is the
sane answer there.
