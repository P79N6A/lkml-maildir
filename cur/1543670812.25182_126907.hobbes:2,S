In this case, what happens if the user space, through mmap, copies
while the message is half-baked (ie, from another CPU) ... won't it
be inconsistent?

Yes, you have to guarantee the existence of the event data structures
(the 'struct kue', the embedded 'struct kue_user' and the event data
itself); if they are embedded into another structure that will dissa-
pear, you can choose to:
(a) recall the event [if it is recallable or makes sense to do so]
(b) dynamically allocate the event header and data, generate it 
    into that dynamic space.
(c) dynamically allocate and copy [slow]
(this works now; however, once I finish the destructor code, it
will give you the flexibility to use other stuff than just kmalloc()).
You can play many tricks here, but that depends on your needs,
requirements and similar stuff.

Of course; I am assuming the client knows that (this is a must for
static allocation, similar in problem to when you give out an string
from inside your code). If the client is not willing to do that, it
has to dynamically allocate and provide a destructor.

That I do in the (c) case; not in the (b) case. In most situations
you shall be able to choose how to do it [and I guess most sensible
people would choose (b)].

Sure; I'd just like to know how are you maintaining consistency for
the mmap stuff.
