It will presumably also have filled the cache with the writeout data.

Not necessarily.  What if you are using a solid state disk which only
allows a relatively low number of re-write cycles?  What if the disk
is spun down, and spinning it up uses a lot of power?  On a laptop,
you don't necessarily want the disk spinning up just to write one
sector.
