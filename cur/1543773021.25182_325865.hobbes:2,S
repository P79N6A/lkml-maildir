Subject: [PATCH] fix gcc -W warning in netdevice.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This might be a slightly controversial patch in that it adds a cast purely 
to shut up a gcc -W warning, but this header file is used in *lots* of 
places, so when building with gcc -W this warning shows up all over the 
place :
	include/linux/netdevice.h:781: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
With my normal .config I over 120 instances of this one, so shutting it up 
cuts down on the stuff I have to wade through to try and spot real 
potential problems quite a bit.
The cast is completely harmless since the unsigned value that gcc is 
complaining about will never exceed the storage capacity of a plain int, 
and it will not change any actual code behaviour.
Please consider merging.
