Yes, but in this case we have to check all callers of usb_fill_int_urb
to do the recalculation. E.g. in input/usbmouse.c
endpoint->bInterval is used directly as parameter to usb_fill_int_urb.
To avoid breaking things (my suggested patch has no impact on any other
usb driver) and to solve the problem shortly, I suggest to
use my patch and do some kind of refactoring later (You are right,
for a clean interface the interval parameter should have the same
meaning independend of the speed).
Best regards,
Christian
