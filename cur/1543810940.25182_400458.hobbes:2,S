But the EMBEDDED dependency is only on x86_64:
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/Kconfig:
config X86_P4_CLOCKMOD
        tristate "Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation"
        select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
        help
arch/x86_64/kernel/cpufreq/Kconfig:
config X86_P4_CLOCKMOD
        tristate "Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation"
        depends on EMBEDDED
        help
And if the option is mostly useless, what is it good for?
