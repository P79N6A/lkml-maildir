I'm curious on the restrictions the userspace part would have to accept.
Can /usr/swsusp.c write to a file? Currently, you allow it, but I doubt
whether it would be wise to write to a file after you've snapshotted
kernel's filesystem state. OTOH, I don't want to reserve a partition just
for the image. Can userspace allocate memory after ioctl(SYS_FREEZE)?
I have userspace supported encryption of the image in mind.
