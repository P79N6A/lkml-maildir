thanks Ian, i've picked up your series into x86.git.
one small nit - when doing cleanups i've been consistently using this 
formatting for comments:
       /*
        * Be careful parts of head_32.S assume startup_32 is at
        * address 0.
        */
instead of:
       /* Be careful parts of head_32.S assume startup_32 is at
        * address 0.
        */
(this is just personal preference, both forms are CodingStyle conform.  
I like the former a bit more because it visually separates comments from 
previous lines of code more. [and comments have rarely any relationship 
to previous code - they apply to the following code lines.] Anyway, no 
need to resend the series - just please keep this in mind for future 
cleanups.)
