Well we don't want to assume "xen" at this stage.  We're faced with a
choice at present: to make the linux->hypervisor interface be some
xen-specific and xen-controlled thing, or to make it a more formal and
controlled kernel interface which talks to a generic hypervisor rather than
assuming it's Xen down there.
As long as it doesn't hamper performance or general code sanity, I think it
would be better to make this a well-defined and controlled Linux interface.
Some of the code to do that is starting to accumulate in -mm.  Everyone
needs to sit down, take a look at the patches and the proposal and work out
if this is the way to proceed.
