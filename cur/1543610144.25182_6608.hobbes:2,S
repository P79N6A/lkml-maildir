Since all PCI IO is memory mapped on ppc64, IO addresses end up > 32 bits.
Until recently we used to have an IO offset that we added to all accesses
which kept the driver visible IO addresses < 32 bits. (This is still the
case with ppc32)
The change was made to support error handling, the 64 bit token has the
pci bus,dev,fn embedded in it so that the low level IO routines can do
error recovery if in{b,w,l} fails.
I didnt make these changes and it would seem we can link IO address <->
pci bus,dev,fn in other ways, if it turns out many drivers cannot use u64
for IO ports then we will have to investigate them.

Yes MMIO works fine. Is there a reason we force PCI IO on __powerpc__?
