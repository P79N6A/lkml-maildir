Because we never compiled with -DDEBUG so that the ASSERT was
triggered?
There's another such place (line 135) with __libc_read in
__pthread_manager:
  /* Synchronize debugging of the thread manager */
  n = __libc_read(reqfd, (char *)&request, sizeof(request));
  ASSERT(n == sizeof(request) && request.req_kind == REQ_DEBUG);
We should account for a return value of -1 here also, shouldn't we?

Is it still running? ;-)  That would be excellent!
Thanks a lot Wolfram,
