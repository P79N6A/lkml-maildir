modules are nice for many things (like installation), but if you expect to
be able to allocate 100MB continuous RAM on a booted-up 128MB box then you
are simply out of luck.
if modules with tough RAM-needs are absolutely needed for whatever reason,
then use initrd and there will be no fsck problems ...
