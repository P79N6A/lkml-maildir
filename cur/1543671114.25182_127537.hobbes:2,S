The difference to "sound" is that it won't make noise unless asked
to. So it starts with a safe default, and the rest is user policy.
On notebooks, I usually switch it off in my rc scripts after it's
been bothering me for the first time. Interesting ... I just
checked, and it seems that all my machines turn it off by default,
even without me knowingly doing something :-)
