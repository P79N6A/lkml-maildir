Could you explain more on bh leak ? Is there one in the current code ?

Andrew confirmed that this is a valid case.
I don't understand what you want to do here ? If the mapping is NULL,
we can't de-ref it.  Whats the point in putting a warning and de-refing
it. Its going to cause NULL pointer de-ref anyway.
