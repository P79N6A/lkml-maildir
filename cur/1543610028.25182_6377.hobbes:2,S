People with "true" SMP CPUs can have problems as well.  Does this mean
SMP CPUs are not SMP capable?  If only one person is having problems,
chances are there's a problem someplace.  Could it be a faulty
motherboard?  Mismatched CPUs?  Bad memory?  Bad CPU?  Bad power
supply?  There's an awful lot of variables here.
