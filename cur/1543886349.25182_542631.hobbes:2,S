What did really change? Unless I am seriously mistaken,
    curr_events - last_evens + 4096 > 8192
is mathematically equivalent to
    curr_events - last_evens        > 4096
The casting to (long) may however force a signed comparison which turns
things quite upside down, and the comment does not apply anymore.
