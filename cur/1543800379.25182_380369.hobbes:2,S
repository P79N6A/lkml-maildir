it's quite simple: run the latency tracer with stack-trace debugging 
enabled, and it will measure the worst-case stack footprint that is 
triggered on that system. Obviously any compiler version change or 
option change can cause problems, there's nothing new about it - and 
it's not realistic to wait one year for changes like that. If you have 
to wait that long, you are testing it the wrong way.
