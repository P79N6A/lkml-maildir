So it seems the clone( flags ) is a reasonable approach to create new
namespaces. Question is what is the initial state of each namespace?
In pidspace we know we should be creating an empty pidmap !
In network, someone suggested creating a loopback device
In uts, create "localhost"
Are there examples where we rather inherit ?  Filesystem ?
Can we iterate the assumption for each subsystem what people thing is right?
IMHO, there is only a need to refer to a namespace from the global context.
Since one will be moving into a new container, but getting out of one
could be prohibitive (e.g. after migration)
It does not make sense therefore to know the name of a namespace in
a different container.
The example you used below by using the pid comes natural, because
that already limits visibility.
I am still struggling with why we need new sys_calls.
sys_calls already exist for changing certain system parameters (e.g. utsname )
so to me it boils down to identifying a proper initial state when the
namespace is created.

Is then the idea to only allow the container->init to manipulate
or is there need to allow other priviliged processes to perform namespace
manipulation?
Also after thinking about it.. why is there a need to have an external name
for a namespace ?

Agree, just need to be sure we can split it up. But you already keep
a task list per pid-namespace, so there should be no problem IMHO.
If so let's do it now and take it of the table it its as simple as
task_list_lock ::= pspace->task_list_lock

Absolutely, that's why it is useful to have an "external" idea of how
containers are constructed of basic namespaces==subsystems.
The it "simply" becomes a policy. E.g. one can not migrate a container
that has shared subsystems.
Resource accounting I agree, that might required active aggregation
at request time.
