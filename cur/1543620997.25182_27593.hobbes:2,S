Much of my testing has involved varying elevator and bdflush parameters
to find what works best with this. From preliminary results it is clear
that the resolution of the fairness issues in this patch and the read

I'll do a bunch more runs tonight with the latest version of this.
My prior runs were with an earlier version.
Cheers,
Bill
