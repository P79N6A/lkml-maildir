It is very obvious. msleep calls schedule() (ie. sleeps), which is
always a barrier.
The "unobvious" thing is that you wanted to know how the compiler knows
a function is a barrier -- answer is that if it does not *know* it is not
a barrier, it must assume it is a barrier. If the whole msleep call chain
including the scheduler were defined static in the current compilation
unit, then it would still be a barrier because it would actually be able
to see the barriers in schedule(void), if nothing else.
