Oh, that's nothing! :)

One tray of 10 10k RPM disks, per controller.  The controllers are also 
spread across 2 completely separate 64bit/66Mhz PCI busses (not bridged).
   Bus 10, device   8, function  0:
     SCSI storage controller: QLogic Corp. QLA2200 (#2) (rev 5).
       IRQ 23.
       Master Capable.  Latency=96.  Min Gnt=64.
       I/O at 0xb000 [0xb0ff].
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfe1ff000 [0xfe1fffff].
   Bus 10, device   9, function  0:
     SCSI storage controller: QLogic Corp. QLA2200 (#3) (rev 5).
       IRQ 24.
       Master Capable.  Latency=96.  Min Gnt=64.
       I/O at 0xb100 [0xb1ff].
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfe1fe000 [0xfe1fefff].
   Bus 13, device   6, function  0:
     SCSI storage controller: QLogic Corp. QLA2200 (#4) (rev 5).
       IRQ 21.
       Master Capable.  Latency=96.  Min Gnt=64.
       I/O at 0xd000 [0xd0ff].
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfebff000 [0xfebfffff].
   Bus 13, device   7, function  0:
     SCSI storage controller: QLogic Corp. QLA2200 (#5) (rev 5).
       IRQ 22.
       Master Capable.  Latency=96.  Min Gnt=64.
       I/O at 0xd100 [0xd1ff].
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfebfe000 [0xfebfefff].
