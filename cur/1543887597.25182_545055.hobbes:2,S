Yes:
	- your device will not show up properly in sysfs (no
	  device/driver binding ability from userspace, no good
	  information so that udev can properly name the device, etc.)
	- your driver will not work on any pci-hotplug type system (that
	  includes expresscard and pccard and lots of high-end servers.
	- your driver will not be notified if the system is being
	  suspended or resumed or wanting to drop into a low power
	  state.
	- another driver can bind to your device without you ever
	  knowing it.
So in short, use pci_probe and just handle the fact that you need to be
called for two PCI devices and bind to both of them.  It shouldn't be
that hard...
