I am not sure what you like to tell with this.
Programs that depend on specific Linux behavior tend to be non-portable (see 
e.g. nautilus on GNOME). Nautilus tries to get e.g. the drive write speeds
by reading /prov/scsi/******. Besides the fact that this is not available 
elsewhere, it gives incorrect results because there are a lot of DVD writers 
with broken firmware.
Cdrecord implements workarounds for this kind of problems and for this reason, 
the most portable solution for a GUI is to use cdrecord to retrieve the 
information.
