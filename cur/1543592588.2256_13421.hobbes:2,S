You cannot use the kernel atomic/interrupt functions from userspace
on ARM.  You cannot disable interrupts in userspace, and therefore the
kernel atomic functions do not work as you expect them to.
If it is to do with code to be included into the kernel, then why aren't
you defining __KERNEL__ ?
Therefore this change (as far as ARM goes) makes zero sense.
