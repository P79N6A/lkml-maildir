ISDN is the biggest chunk of code blocking removal of some deprecated 
PCI interfaces.
If you want to replace the code completely with a newfangled modular 
design, I will gladly step out of the way and let that happen :)  I only 
know what I see right now, which is code that has sat around for a while 
not getting updated to the new PCI API.
Since I do not have any ISDN hardware, my plan was to do equivalent 
transformations of the code.  Each patch just shuffles code, but 
maintains a working state at all time, making it trivial to prove 
(mathematically, or with testing, or with git-bisect) that the code 
continues to work.
So, just tell me which you would prefer.  If you are going to fix all 
this stuff, there is plenty of other stuff on my list to work on. 
Otherwise I will create equivalent-transform patches that take the 
existing code and modify it just enough to be correct for the new PCI API.
