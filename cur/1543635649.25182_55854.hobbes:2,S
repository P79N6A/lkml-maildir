Nice, so you still have to strip and export to the transport layer.
Please expand on what you are going to talk to packetized and the 
associated transport protocol restricted to the scope of storage.
Next count all the different personalitys associated with the discrete
transport layer.
If you are referring to Jens' pktcdvd interface out of block, it is no
more than a bypass of dealing with scsi.  It would allow direct access to
the physical transport without portions of OS mucking up things as it does
now.
