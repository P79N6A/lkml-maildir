Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ring-buffer: prevent false positive warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/23/112

Impact: fix to false WARN_ON
If an interrupt goes off after the setting of the local variable
tail_page and before incrementing the write index of that page,
the interrupt could push the commit forward to the next page.
Later a check is made to see if interrupts pushed the buffer around
the entire ring buffer by comparing the next page to the last commited
page. This can produce a false positive if the interrupt had pushed
the commit page forward as stated above.
Thanks to Jiaying Zhang for finding this race.
