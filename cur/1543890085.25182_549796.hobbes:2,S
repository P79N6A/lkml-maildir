Subject: [RFC][PATCH -mm 0/3] PM: Hibernation and suspend notifiers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The first of the following three patches introduces notifier chaing that can be
used by subsystems to prefore some hibernation-related or suspend-related
operations independent of device drivers' .suspend() and .resume() callbacks.
The next two patches use this mechanism for disabling/enabling the usermode
helper and firmware requesting functionality before/after (respectively) the
hibernation or suspend.
Comments welcome.
Greetings,
Rafael
