Documentation/filesystems/Locking seems to be accurate. Originally we were 
taking inode->i_sem for all four xattr operations. It turned out that this 
caused lock contention for acls. Selinux increases the frequency of xattr 
operations, so always taking i_sem would be even worse now.

The old handler API was fine at the FS level where locking was guaranteed 
anyways. At the VFS level we should do better. Passing in the buffer and the 
buffer size at the same time gets us rid of the problem without requiring any 
locking.

Both styles are being used in VFS. Choose one; I don't mind much.
