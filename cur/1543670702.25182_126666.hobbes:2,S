Is that true even on the 32-bit Athlons, especially the older ones?
I can understand the special-casing on Opteron, since in 64-bit mode
you'll see more of the prefixes, but for older K7s?

Yes, decoding is not usually an issue on a trace-cache-driven thing, 
either P4 or Transmeta.

I think the P3 (which is still Intel's "current" offering as it comes to 
the mobile Pentium-M side) has problems. And there are still people who 
use even older chips.
Of course, for _this_ particular case (ie sfence/mfence) older chips do 
not matter, as they'll fall back on the longer sequence and never see the 
no-ops, but we may have other replacements where it goes the other way and 
it's the _new_ sequence that is shorter.

Looks good to me.
I do have _one_ more small niggling issue - I think this patch also makes
the CONFIG_X86_SSE2 define be a thing of the past. Or is it used for
something else still? It would be good to remove it, and try to make most
of the architecture choices be pure optimization hints (apart from some of
the more painful architecture updates like the broken write protect on the
original 386). That will make it easier for distribution makers.
