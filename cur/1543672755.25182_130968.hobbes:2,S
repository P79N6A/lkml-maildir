No it doesn't, that's what I keep saying:
static int probe_lba_addressing (ide_drive_t *drive, int arg)
{
        drive->addressing =  0;
        if (HWIF(drive)->addressing)
                return 0;
	...
so if hwif->addressing != 0, you will never allow 48-bit lba on any
units on this hardware interface. So the correct logic is:
	hwif->rqsize = hwif->addressing ? 256 : 65536;
as in the patch.

Correct.

If hwif->addressing == 1, drive->addressing will never be anything _but_
0.

Which?

Doesn't matter. I actually only thought about dma, in which case it
doesn't matter because we never change sector or nr_sectors until after
we have called ide_dma_end. For pio, it's no more reliable with hard_*
than without. This is all for end_request context of course, at init
time it's all the same. Essentially, we _need_ the taskfile changes for
this to work. In that case we can limit rq_lba48() to init request time,
and set task->addressing and use that from then on.

Ditto, cannot be reliable without the taskfile changes.
I won't bother with anything new until the taskfile stuff is in.
