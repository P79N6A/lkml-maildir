description:
             (reduced version of the universal 'interceptors')
             _SAFE_ way to intercept system calls.
Two exported functions:
             previous = register_interceptor( handler );
             unregister_interceptor( handler );
Goals:
             checking or patching something without a need to recompile
             extending modules functionality (for example write notifications)
Characteristics:
             Performance fee - few tacts per call :-)
             Tested on i386; seems to be stable.
The patch is against 2.3.9.
                         Best regards.
