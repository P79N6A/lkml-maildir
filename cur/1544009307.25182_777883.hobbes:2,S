Hello earth calling, wake up.
The userspace opens major 5 minor 1. The kernel has no driver mapped to
that so the kernel asks user space to load a module of its choice for
major 5 minor 1. What user space does with that is and has always been a
problem for user space.
User space is quite at liberty to go .. 5,1  and I have a serial console
I want to load 8250_pci please.
What it must not do is try and re-open it again and again and again.
You may not assume that a given device load mapping is solely used to
create the most basic device node involved. It isn't that simple. In many
cases a device node translates to a series of module loads of otherwise
apparently unrelated devices.
