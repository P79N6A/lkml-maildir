Ok, so I did. The gist of it - a very quick analysis said "no, it does 
not cover the keys". You can now return to your usual debate.
More in details, the keys seem like a late addition to the already 
compiled kernel, have a standalone existance, and are not even code, and 
can therefor not be considered "deriviative work".
