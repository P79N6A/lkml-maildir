Unfortunately, I haven't done an analysis of this algorithm, but quick 
empirical tests for random, reversed, and sorted data show stack usage 
to be about 50% less than glibc's qsort() for large data sets.  We were 
using the qsort() as exists in XFS, but when discussing with Cristoph, 
he asked that we use this qsort() implementation instead.  It seems to 
perform markedly better for large sets, too.
