 The TURBOchannel is currently DECstation-only, so it can be easily
deduced by the system type from /proc/cpuinfo (Alphas have it there as
well, so if the Alpha port is ever finished there should be no problem). 
You can have a Qbus-TURBOchannel bridge on certain VAX systems, so it
would have to be detected separately once (if) supported.
 I'm not sure if it's worthwhile to implement /proc/bus/tc or whatever as
there is likely nothing in the userland to need that info ever and for
diagnostics the firmware and the startup log are sufficient.  If useful,
it would be trivial to code, though.
