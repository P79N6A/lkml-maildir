I think it makes most sense.

I think compatibility at the source level is good here. UTF-8 looks
nice, though.
I think it could remain compatible - c_cc[] could grow into array of
multibyte characters with:
#define VINTR 0
#define VQUIT (1 * n)
#define VERASE (2 * n)
#define VKILL (3 * n)
where n is max number of UTF-8 bytes (5 for 32-bit UCS?)
I'm not sure if UTF-8 control codes are needed in practice, though
(I mean I just don't know).

A bit messy I think. I think the first way is much better. Especially
when we have multiple changes (speed and UTF-8, for example).

Sure, I meant what does speed_t resolve to.

While obviously I'm not glibc (nor termios) expert I don't think
we should expect problems. New glibc would just issue the old ioctl
if the new one isn't available. I think similar things are already
in place.
Glibc could be compiled with minimum kernel version = 2.6.20 or so
to assume the new ioctls are always present.
