afaik we don't really support hot unplug like this.
Changes were made a few months ago (make the VFS use file->f_mapping rather
than file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping) which set some of the pieces in
place but I think there's a way to go yet.
umm, the general idea is that when the disk vanishes your driver should
then return -EIO for all future I/O requests.  The block_device, the queue,
the inode and all that stuff remains in-core.
After device hot unplug we need to do <something> to disassociate the
defunct blockdev inode from the /dev/hdXX node.  I think <something> hasn't
been coded yet.
Later, someone puts in new media and you can then access that via /dev/hdXX
- you get a brand new inode, blockdev, queue, etc.  The old defunct one is
still alive, returning -EIO.
Eventually, all references to the old inode/blockdev/queue go away (due to
applications hitting EIO, etc).  The old mountpoint can be unmounted and
this drops the final ref, so the old inode/blockdev/queue get freed up.
As I say, I don't think all of this is implemented yet, but perhaps a lot
of it is.
