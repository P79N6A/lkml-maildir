yes, it's a superflous line, it's the equivalent of the 2.5.40 line
here:
	rq->idle = current;
	set_task_cpu(current, smp_processor_id());
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	wake_up_process(current);
it is a superflous bit in the o1 scheduler changes. If the boot cpu
isn't id 0 it must be initialized by the architectural code in arch/.
Either that or sched_init must use hard_smp_processor_id(). On most
archs the boot cpu is id 0 so it probably doesn't trigger if needed.
