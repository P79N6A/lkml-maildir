I do agree that the suggested patch seems to be a real cleanup, regardless 
of whether the original code bug has now been fixed or not.
Are there devices that really want the old sequence? 
Also, do we really need to send fist a start_stop 1 and then a 2?
Wouldn't the _logical_ thing be to replace the old code with just a 
cleaned-up-version of what the old code did, ie just do
	err = blk_send_start_stop(q, bd_disk, 0x02);
for the eject case? That way we could do the patch as a pure cleanup, and 
then a separate patch might change the singe "start_stop 2" with the more 
complex sequence.
(IOW, I'd prefer to separate out the cleanup from the "make the eject 
sequence more complete" part).
