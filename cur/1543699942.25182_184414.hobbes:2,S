Right, although that specific implementation only cares about things

Well, *I* sure want it to.  Batching things up is fine, just the
current implementation isn't.
Yeah, it is good enough most of the time, so noone cares enough.

Then talk about checking for zero runs.  Same thing.  Either you have
to read *everything* from disk, so you don't want to do this too
often, or you need a way to figure out, what has changes since the
last run.
Or talk about updates, same thing as well.
What we do right now is basically polling, a very expensive and
therefore infrequent polling.  Sure, it works, but it's far from
perfect.
Anyway, subject has drifted away allready and we sure won't reach
agreement.  Doesn't matter anyway as long as noone provides the
patches, so let's just drop the thread, ok?
