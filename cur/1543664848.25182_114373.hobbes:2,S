Ivan,
   Here is the full messages output for a system with this problem.   I had

No, this means that mp tables are broken in a way I didn't expect...
Also, it's unclear whether or not the IOxAPIC routing is broken as well.
Probably full dmesg output (especially things related to IO_APICs setup
and irq<->pin mapping) could shed some light on this.
