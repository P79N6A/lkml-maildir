Does it work if somebody renames a directory in the path leading to
the autofs mountpoint?  The result is very similar to move mount.
You could solve both, by having the automoutnter daemon chdir to the
autofs root, and then it would just not care about any namespace
changes outside it's own filesystem.
Bind and clone(... CLONE_NEWNS) are trickier if you want to make
automounting work in the new instance.  It should be workable, if the
autofs kernel module returns a reference not just to the dentry but
the dentry/vfsmount pair to the daemon.  For example it could open a
file descriptor with dentry_open() refering to the mountpoint, and
pass that to userspace.  The daemon then can do the mount on in
(either by doing fchdir(fd) and 'mount blah .', or 'mount blah
/proc/PID/fd/FD').
This is all very theoretical, I don't know how the internals of
autofs...
On a related note, have you looked at using the kernel atumounter
support for autofs? (Documentation/filesystems/automount-support.txt)
