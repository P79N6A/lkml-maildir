Yikes, not really :-)
You're basically saying "if we're in a kdump kernel, let's ignore all
DMA errors and hope for the best". This is not really acceptable. What
we could do is limit the scope of ignorance - only ignore errors from
the point the kdump kernel starts booting until we have reinitialized
the device and then go back to handling DMA errors correctly.
Cheers,
