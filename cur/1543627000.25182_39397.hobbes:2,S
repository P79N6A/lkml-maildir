I would like to rewrite the kernel in FORTRAN because this was
one of the first languages I learned.
Seriously, the kernel MUST be written in a procedural language.
It is the mechanism by which something is accomplished that defines
an operating system kernel.
C++ is an object-oriented language, in fact the opposite of a
procedural language. It is not suitable.
Many so-called programmers look at kernel code and see that a
lot is written in 'C'. Then they think; "I can do this better
because I know C++. Everybody knows that C++ is better than
plain old C..."
If you really knew C++, you wouldn't even joke about putting it
in the kernel.
Cheers,
