No tricks, IP[v6] is already enforced to be clever; all the rest are free
to do this, if they desire. And btw, driver need not to parse anything,
but its internal stuff and even aligning eth II header can be made
in eth_type_trans().
Actually, it is possible now not changing anything but driver.
Fortunately, I removed stupid tulip from alpha, so that I have
no impetus to try this myself. 8)
