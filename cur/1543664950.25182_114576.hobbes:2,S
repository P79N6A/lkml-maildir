Erm, not sure if this is normal behaviour but, X reports
	--) RADEON(0): VideoRAM: 65536 kByte (64-bit DDR SDRAM)
and it was bought as a 64Mbyte card.
however, /proc/pci reports
	(..) Radeon RV200 QW [Radeon 7500] (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Memory at d0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=128M]
	(..)						^^^
The card works fine on indirect and direct rendering modes.
