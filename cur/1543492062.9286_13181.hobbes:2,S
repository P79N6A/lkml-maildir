Could you try using the CVS version of isdn4linux?
Go to ftp.suse.com, and (I think) in /pub/isdn4linux/2.1 there are
tar files of CVS snapshots. Get a recent one, unpack it somewhere,
copy the contents to the kernel source tree with "./std2kern -d -k
/usr/src/linux" (or wherever you have your sources). Reconfigure,
rebuild your utils (make sure the path to the kernel source is correct
in the utils config), and test that.
