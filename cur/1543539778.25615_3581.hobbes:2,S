I'm trying out 2.4.0-test4 on an HP machine (netserver 6000, 6cpu) with their
ami controller. This machine currently runs 2.2.15 (stock) without any
problems. With 2.4.0-test4, it isn't able to detect any devices on the scsi
bus. It appears that the delta is a minor version flip in the AMI driver (v107
-> v107b), does anyone know of any problems with using the 2.2.x driver would
work in 2.4.0-testX?
Anything else I should try?
