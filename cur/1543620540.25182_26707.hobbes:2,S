Hi Steve, 
I'm the maintainer, and I just found your 15-11-2001 mail. Indeed I
seem to have forgotten to reply.. Sorry about that.
We have fixed a couple of RIO things since 2.4.2, so I would recommend
that you try running a more recent kernel....
And keep bugging me and/or perle/specialix support if you need
help. This card/driver is supported and you should get the support you
require. We'll work with you till it works. (but we do reserve the
right to ask you to upgrade to a kernel that has fixes we've done in
the past...)
