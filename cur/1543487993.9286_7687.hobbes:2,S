Dear Linus et al,
With Ingo's help, I have identified the cause of gettimeofday's
non-monotonicity as a broken timer chip on my 486 motherboard.
The chip reports counter values above the valid maximum of 11931.
With BUGGY_NEPTUN_TIMER defined in arch/i386/kernel/time.c, the
problem was hidden.  Perhaps it would be best to leave this
undefined by default, or at least check for an invalid count
value in do_slow_gettimeoffset().  Thanks,
-Truxton
