Thank you for being so gracious and patient with me.

True, artifacts appeared even in the basic arithmetic sequence of
primes.  It is quite possible that a large set of natural sequences
might cause artifacts.

This is likely due to the relatively small sample sets; however, real
experienced data sets would be very small compared to the widest
possible set and might also contain structured gaps.

Yes, it is slower by inspection.

Yes, I now agree.  And, for the purpose of dynamic hash sizing, high
dispersion is worse than artifacts.
For some realistic TCP data sets it appears that XOR is superior.
Thank you again for your efforts in resolving my doubts.
So what are your thoughts about my sequence number approach (for
connected sockets)?
