Declaring the section for externs like this isn't very useful really.  I
don't think there's any way in which the compiler can check it and the
linker will look at the definition, not at the declarations.  And if we add
these, we just need to keep the declarations updated for cosmetic reasons
as you've discovered.
So I'd recommend you simply remove the __initdata tags here and leave it at
that.
