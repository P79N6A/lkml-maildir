Here's my take on it.  The point of ageing is twofold - to age down pages
that aren't in use, and to age up pages that *are* in use.  So, pages that
are in use will remain with high ages even when background scanning is
being done, and pages that aren't in use will decay to zero age.
I can't see what's wrong with that.  When we need more memory, it's a Very
Good Thing to know that most of the pages in the system haven't been
accessed in yonks - we know exactly which ones we want to throw out first.
