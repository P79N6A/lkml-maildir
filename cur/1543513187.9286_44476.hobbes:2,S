Subject: 2.3.32: CONFIG_BIGMEM does not compile on x86

	If CONFIG_BIGMEM is selected in Linux 2.3.22, then
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c will refer to the symbol MAX_PFN, which
is not defined.
	I am not quite sure what CONFIG_BIGMEM does vis-a-vis
CONFIG_{1,2}GB, since the documention for CONFIG_BIGMEM in
Documentation/Configure.txt is a copy of the documentation for
CONFIG_2GB.  However, I thought I might as well report this
compilation problem anyhow.
