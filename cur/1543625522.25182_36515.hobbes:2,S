Subject: [patch] smaller kernels

[patch] x86 BUG handling
Of the latter, Andrew says: "kernel size is reduced by 90 kbytes
relative to a CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=y build" and of the former: "Kernel
size is reduced by another 110 kbytes in my build."
The former is a duplicate string removal patch, and gcc >= 3 does most of
that automatically, so you won't see the much difference. The latter only
reduces kernel size compared to BUG_VERBOSE=y (and may slightly increase the
size compared the BUG_VERBOSE=n).
