  Hi, all. Version 129 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: this is the first patch which removes compatibility entries (as
required by Linus). If you need the compatibility entries, install
devfsd-v1.2.5 which will create them automatically if you ask.
This is against 2.3.22-pre1. Highlights of this release:
Work sponsored by SGI
- Removed compatibility entries for sound devices
- Removed compatibility entries for printer devices
- Removed compatibility entries for video4linux devices
- Removed compatibility entries for parallel port devices
- Removed compatibility entries for frame buffer devices
				Regards,
					Richard....
