Follow-up: I think this is mostly X-related. I've started 100 scheddos,
and all get the same CPU percentage. Interestingly, mpg123 in parallel
does never skip at all because it needs quite less than 1% CPU and gets
its fair share at a load of 112. Xterms are slow to respond to typing
with the 12 gears and 100 scheddos, and expectedly it was X which was
starving. renicing it to -5 restores normal feeling with very slow
but smooth gear rotations. Leaving X niced at 0 and killing the gears
also restores normal behaviour.
All in all, it seems logical that processes which serve many others
become a bottleneck for them.
Forking becomes very slow above a load of 100 it seems. Sometimes,
the shell takes 2 or 3 seconds to return to prompt after I run
"scheddos &"
Those are very promising results, I nearly observe the same responsiveness
as I had on a solaris 10 with 10k running processes on a bigger machine.
I would be curious what a mysql test result would look like now.

Willy
