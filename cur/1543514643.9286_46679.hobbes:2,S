  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.7 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 (or later).
The main changes are:
- Added entries for /dev/st, /dev/sg and /dev/sr hierarchies
- Added compatibility entries for loop, IDE tape and SCSI CD-ROM
  drivers.
				Regards,
					Richard....
