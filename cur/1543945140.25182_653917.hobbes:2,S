Subject: [PATCH 00/14] [ISDN] HiSax hotplug conversion
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is a refresh of an on-going work-in-progress:  convert the last
remaining users of pci_find_device() to the ISA/PCI/etc.  hotplug APIs
now in standard use.  After SCSI's gdth, ISDN's HiSax suite of drivers
are just about the last place using the older API.
A few rough edges remain, and I'm not sure how much of ISDN userland
will explode (I have no ISDN hardware, nor much want any:)), but this
should get us almost all the way there.
The patches are diff'd against 2.6.25-rc1.
Comments/review/testing welcome.  Especially "it works" or "its dead"
testing.
