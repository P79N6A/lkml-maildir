Hmm.. It looks like the same commit that caused these Kconfig issues is 
also the one that causes the problems with lmsensors (I didn't immediately 
realize that it's the exact same commit).
I think that right now the right thing to do is to just revert it, since 
apparently there won't be a released lmsensors version by the time 2.6.25 
gets released that can handle the new sysfs layout, and that we should 
give this some more time to be resolved.
So I'm inclined to revert commit 3152fb9f11cdd2fd8688c2c5cb805e5c09b53dd9 
and plan on revisiting this for 2.6.26. I already got an ack for that from 
Jean Delvare, but I thought I'd mention it in this thread too before I 
actually do the final revert.
Any really strong objections?
