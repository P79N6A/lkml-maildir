I'm a bit late to the party here (was gone on vacation), but I do have
profiles from DSS workloads using page-cache rather than O_DIRECT and
I do see spin_lock_irq() in the profiles which I'm pretty certain are
locks spinning for access to the radix_tree.  I'll talk about it a bit
more up in Ottawa but here's the top 5 on my profile (sorry don't have
the number of ticks at the momement):
1. dedicated_idle (waiting for I/O)
2. __copy_tofrom_user
3. radix_tree_delete
4. _spin_lock_irq
5. __find_get_block
So, yes, if the page-cache is used in a DSS workload then one will see
the tree-lock.  BTW, this was on a PPC64 machine w/ a fairly small
NUMA factor.
