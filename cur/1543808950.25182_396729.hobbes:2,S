There's been enough churn here that it'll be counterproductive for me to
continue to munge on your patches.  I'll drop the lot and will await rev
#2.
I don't think any of this was critical for 2.6.16.  If there's something
which you really do think needs to be in 2.6.16 then please carefully
describe the reasons for that, and make sure that the most critical
patches are staged at the head of the series.
