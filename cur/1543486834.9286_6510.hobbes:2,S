Look in linux/kernel/super.c for "request_module".
If someone refers to an unknown filesystem type, a request for a module
with that name will be done.  Note that you might have to include an
alias in /etc/conf.modules in order to map the name of the filesystem
to the corresponding module name.
So, if you refer to a new filesystem type, and if you have the module,
it will be autoloaded without any kernel changes.
