To be honest, most of my testing was aimed at validating the correctness of
this patch. I think there's a pretty good case to be made for having an
ocfs2_readpages() method though.
We get to avoid expensive cluster locking during readahead, which would
normally make us bounce data around the cluster.
Also, we save some cpu by avoiding the entire operation for in-inode data.

Ok, point takne  ;)
I fixed this and the other typo you pointed out.
