Yes, there are often interrupt entrails on the stack.  If you can,
generate that trace and send it....

That's OK - this is the x86 version of atomic_set and yes, we
assume that the compiler will generate a single write for the
store.  All the x86 MP cache coherency stuff takes care of
the atomicity wrt other CPUs.

Locally.  You need to take spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock)
before calling that function.  It doesn't call anything which
sleeps, either.
It may simplify your oops tracing to remove all the `inline'
qualifiers in ll_rw_blk.c, BTW.  They tend to obscure things.
They should in fact be taken out permanently - someone went
absolutely insane there.
