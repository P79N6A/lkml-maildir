DRBD has built-in logic
to track which copy of the data is the most recent.
DRBD has resource-level-fencing in place (though we can improve on that).
DRBD deals with concurrent writes of the participating nodes correctly.
"N-disk" is not the question,
you can stack drbd on top of md, lvm, anything.
N-nodes is the interessting thing.
