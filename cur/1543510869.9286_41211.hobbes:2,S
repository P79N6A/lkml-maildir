In the UK this is not true, unless the PBX is free standing. If the PBX is
connected to the PSTN you may only connect approved products to it. In many
countries a PBX is considered an adequate barrier, to avoid approvals issues with
attached equipment.
The wording in the UK approvals documents talks about "direct and indirect
connection to the PSTN". Your computer is indirectly connected to the PSTN, but
that obviously doesn't need approval - one of the key things a modem does is
provide a barrier to ensure that. There were some efforts to resolve this woolly
wording, but I don't know what happened.

"Now" is an interesting word, here. The UK and the Netherlands were already in
the EU when their national approvals processes were developed. There is an
EU approvals process, but it still seems immature.
