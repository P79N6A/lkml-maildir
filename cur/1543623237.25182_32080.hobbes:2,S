this gets cache line size correct

You only need to worry about the PCI_COMMAND_INVALIDATE bit here, unless
your chip requires other setup, or you care to handle PCI hard errors in
the driver.

The rule is, never ever enable MWI if cache line size is zero.
MWI -does- make a difference in performance, though you may need to
check lanstreamer docs to see if there is a chip-specific MWI bit you
need to enable, over and above the PCI_COMMAND bit.
