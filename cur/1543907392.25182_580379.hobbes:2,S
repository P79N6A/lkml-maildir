So this afternoon i compiled 2.6.23-rc2 with same options as 2.6.23-rc1 and edited grub.conf to add nosmp but after reboot the box did not responded. Back home, i saw that the kernel failed because it was unable to find the partitions (mdadm failed, then LVM). After a few tests, removing nosmp let the kernel boot correctly. It seems that even the fedora provided kernels have the same behavior (well at least 2.6.22.1-41.fc7).
