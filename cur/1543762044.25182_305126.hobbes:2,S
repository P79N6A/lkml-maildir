fork connector can be extended to send to the rest of the world
information that it was turned off or on.
The easiest way to listen inside the kernel for connector's 
notifications is creating appropriate socket in userspace
and then obtain it through the following code which must be
run in context of the process that created above socket:
	struct file *file;
	struct inode *inode;
	int err = 0;
	file = fget(userspace_socket_number_in_the_current_process_context);
	if (!file) {
		return -ENODEV;
	}
	inode = file->f_dentry->d_inode;
	if (inode->i_sock) {
		sock = SOCKET_I(inode);
		err = 0;
	} else {
		fput(file);
		err = -ENODEV;
	}
sock is struct sock, which then can be used for read/write
operations using 
kernel_recvmsg(sock, &msg, &iov, 1, size, 0);
kernel_sendmsg(sock, &msg, &iov, 1, size);
with the following initialisation:
sock->sk->sk_allocation |= GFP_NOIO;
iov.iov_base = buf;
iov.iov_len = size;
msg.msg_name = NULL;
msg.msg_namelen = 0;
msg.msg_control = NULL;
msg.msg_controllen = 0;
msg.msg_namelen = 0;
msg.msg_flags = msg_flags | MSG_NOSIGNAL;
Of course it can be done directly from kernelspace without
touching process's structures, but this way is easier.
