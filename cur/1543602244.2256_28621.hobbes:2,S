I will write a patch for this to add VIA KT266 support (so you don't
need to do the agp_try_unsupported=1 mess, it will be supported

I'll send it out in a sec, start downloading 2.4.10 :)

Yes, I believe this is a bug.  Maybe I should take a look at it...
agpgart doesn't read the command line, or not correctly, or something.
