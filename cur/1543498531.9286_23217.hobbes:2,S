Let's start with the files involved...

Linus has made his viewpoint clear enough on this, so if you're a
maintainer and you're interested in joining the "Keep Linux Clean"
campaign, you only have to worry about that particular word if you're
responsible for any of the above files...
Also, a quick analysis points out the following architecture items:
 Q> ix86 specific sections:		1
 Q> MIPS spcific sections:		5
 Q> SPARC specific sections:		6
 Q> SPARC64 specific sections:		5
 Q> General sections:			5
In the above, I classify an entry as being "specific" if it's either
in a file that's specific to that architecture, or in a section of a
general file that's surrounded by a #ifdef-#endif for the stated
architecture. "general" is thus anything that doesn't qualify.
I will state that there's two entries therein that really ought to be
cleaned up, for different reasons:
 1. Word used gratuiously.
 2. Word used to describe Linus Torvalds.
The following patch would clean both up sensibly, if applied, although
I would doubt the accuracy of the second one.
