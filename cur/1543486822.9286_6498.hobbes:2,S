** sorry i know no one to ask:( **
am running squid on a linux 2.2.1 box and am running out of file
descriptors, there was a patch for this when i was using the 2.0.36 kernel.
 so i think this is a kernel issue.  
if the current kernel (2.2.x) allows for a lot of fds per process, how will
i inform the process to go ahead, it's ok?  
they ask about changing the "#define OPEN_MAX" line in the
"/usr/include/linux/limits.h" 
file.  is this the way to do it?
thanks.
please reply directly, am NOT on this list.  i wouldn't even begin to
understand what most of you guys take for granted.
