Hello,
Your readv/writev patch interested me and I checked it.
I found we also have a chance to improve normal writev.
a_ops->prepare_write() and a_ops->commit_write will have a
penalty when I/O size isn't PAGE_SIZE.
With following patch generic_file_write_nolock() will try to
make each I/O size become PAGE_SIZE.
Could you apply it?

Thank you,
