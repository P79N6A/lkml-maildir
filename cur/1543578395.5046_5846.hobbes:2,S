	Applying Linus's patch is fine, but I think my patch should also
be applied (in addition), although for a less important reason.  The
bforget in cramfs is going to force unnecessary device IO if cramfs
is in the list of file systems that you are trying to detect when
mounting a file system from a physical device.
