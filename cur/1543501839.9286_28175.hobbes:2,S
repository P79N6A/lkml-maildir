I have one of the older (ppa) ones, and any attempt to write scribbles on
the disk (partition table seems to get damaged) and leaves the motor of the
drive on. Tried 2.2.10ac{7,8}, 2.3.6, 2.2.5-15 (Mandrake 6.0 stock kernel).
Reading works fine so far. WinNT on the same machine works fine, so I doubt
the Zip drive is broken.
parport, parport_pc, ppa, scsi_mod, sd_mod are all modules; printer is
connected to the drive; i586/UP
Any ideas?
