Ach, Geert, how painful to behold!
Never forget: a kdev_t is a pointer to a structure,
and MAJOR takes a field of this structure.
Casting an integer to a structure is ridiculous.
There are functions to_kdev_t etc to do the conversion
(and these may involve lookup in a hash table).
Please keep the source as much as possible kdev_t clean.
At some point in time, I hope 2.5.1, we must change,
and all such cruft would have to be fixed again.
