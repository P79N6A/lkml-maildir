Sure it is.  If you wrote that code Andre, patch or not, and you
release it as GPL code, then it is just that.  Patches sent to
linux-kernel that are rejected are not just free-bait for M$ to
use.

I somewhat doubt M$ will claim a seat like that.  ;o)

And why can your code not get included now?  I thought the IDE
code thing was resolved now, and that the legal issues were
covered?  I hope that any work you're doing that is adding new
features, is both submitted and accepted.  If your patches are
refused solely because of past differences with people due to the
old IDE thread of a month or so ago, then something is definitely
wrong with the devel model here.  If someone produces a useful
patch, and it gets refused based on personal grounds of someone
else, then Linux is in trouble.  Lets hope that this is not the
case for sure..
Take care!
