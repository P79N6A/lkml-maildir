The merging issue pointed out by Giuliano Pochini is there since 2.2.0.

In 2.4.0-test1-ac22 there were a latency-driven elevator (the one we have
now since test2 can't provide good latency anymore).
So if something it should be the other way around, the elevator that we
have since test2 should provide _better_ throghput and _less_ seeks. Thus
it can't be the elevator algorithm but maybe as Ingo said something in the
plugging that broke during the test2 changes.

It's zero because in reality is not limited anymore, this just mean it
should provide better performance and worse latency.

Are you doing synchronous writes, right?

tiotest should provide better numbers with the elevator from test2
(compared to the test1 one).
