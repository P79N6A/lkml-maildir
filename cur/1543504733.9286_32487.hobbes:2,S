Agreed.

This was the solution I was thinking about.  It seems to me that the drivers
should be responsible for saving the hardware persistance.  Forgetting the mixer
state for a second, saving off hardware register state is a requirement for
some power managment schemes. 
I don't know if this necessarily needs to be built into the core kernel
services.  In fact I would argue that the kernel shouldn't be polluted with
state management.  However, it seems that if devices are going to need to save
state then some module should exist to provide a common mechansim.

This brings up another point.  I want to save state as a means of getting away
from passing command line parameters.  This is a scary prospect for the new
Linux user.

Some audio devices have strange power up mixer settings.  This might not always
work.
