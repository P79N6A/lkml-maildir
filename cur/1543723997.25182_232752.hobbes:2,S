Sorry.  I skimmed all the code and comments for pgd_offset_k and thought at
the time that it was strictly an optimized shortcut for pgd_offset.
Clearly I did not understand the ia64 code.

That seems like the reasonable thing to do.  I considered just putting all
that logic into arch-specific code, joining with the get_gate_vma code.
But that would leave x86_64 requiring duplication of the generic version.
At least with the various arch cases around now, just adding pgd_offset_gate 
is the thing that will allow maximal code sharing.
Thanks,
Roland
