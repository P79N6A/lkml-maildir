That's just absolute bullshit.
I'm sorry to say this, Rodolfo, but _all_ your arguments above are
*totally* nonsensical and factually incorrect -- and I have had enough of
trying to talk sense to you, it's been ~15 mails in this thread already,
and I've been WASTING my time trying to teach / explain to you, but it's
just *shocking* that you prefer to stick to a wholly incorrect (which I
suspect you've already understood by now anyway) position rather than
just accepting that the present patch is wrong and go about correcting
it instead.

Try reading the RFC again, please. And *think*.
Anyway, considering:
1. broken/nonsensical locking,
2. wrong (completely RFC non-compliant) implementation,
3. a syscall (time_pps_cmd) that has no semantics defined anywhere,
   not even mandated by the RFC, is (as you yourself admitted)
   a pseudo-ioctl for all practical purposes,
4. abject lack of security in the syscall implementations,
But MOST importantly:
5. your _sticking_ to the broken implementation and being so
   (shockingly!) unwilling to correct these,
I really cannot see how I can support this stuff in getting merged
at all, sorry.
