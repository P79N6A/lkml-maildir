kernel 2.2.5 crashes on boot up.
pentium60 kernel: Starting kswapd 
pentium60 kernel: Serial driver version 
The kernel crashes on boot up after printing the first line.  I can't even ctrl-alt-delete to reboot.  None of the scroll lock diagnostic keys work either.  I compiled a version of kernel 2.2.5 from the redhat source.
keywords: kswapd serial driver
I was using a pentium 60 with 40 Mbyte of ram, one IDE drive, and 2 scsi drives.  
Here is some more information:
