Given that the Slashdot note was a pointer to Microsoft and echo of 
their statements of a firmware fix, and that same information is on the 
Microsoft site, I find it hard to find fault with them as a source for 
pointers and some context on why they might be useful. If Intel has 
released new microcode to address the issue, then it seems the code 
didn't function as desired, and it doesn't matter what you call it.

That was one question.

I don't ignore anything I can fix. An ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure. My systems don't currently crash, and that's the intended 
behavior.
I was mainly concerned with this being a new issue, and curious if 
Microsoft was calling an O/S bug a "microcode fix," given that the 
average Windows user doesn't know microcode from nanotech anyway. The 
non-answer from Arjan didn't answer either, and started by calling the 
report FUD, implying that Slashdot was wrong (not about this), and 
issuing so little answer and so much obfuscation that I thought he might 
be running for President. ;-)
I'd like the microcode update, some people elsewhere speculate that user 
level code could effect reliability if not security. I worry that an old 
2.4 kernel would be an issue, even in kvm, if that were the case.
