Hi, gentlemen!
I'd like to know why the ugly error messages about changing old root when
booting with initrd image have been left in released 2.2.0? I can understand
them being in developers' version, but we have a 2.2.0 Release.... Are they
forgotten about or left on a purpose (e.g. for frigtening unsuspecting
user :))?
The messages are:
=== Cut ===
Jan 26 21:05:15 nomad kernel: VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Jan 26 21:05:15 nomad kernel: change_root: old root has d_count=5
Jan 26 21:05:15 nomad kernel: Trying to unmount old root ... <3>error -16
Jan 26 21:05:15 nomad kernel: Change root to /initrd: error -2
Jan 26 21:05:15 nomad kernel: Freeing unused kernel memory: 60k freed
=== Cut ===
I can (and I will definitely do) comment those error messages outta
distribution kernel, but I think they have to be removed outta production
kernel...
