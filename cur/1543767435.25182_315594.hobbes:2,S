Oh, you can't do this here, attach_domains does a synchronize_kernel.
So take it out, it doesn't do anything anyway, does it?
I suggest you also use some sort of locking to prevent concurrent rebuilds
and rebuilds racing with cpu hotplug. You could probably have a static
semaphore around rebuild_sched_domains, and take lock_cpu_hotplug here too.
Or alternatively take the semaphore in the cpu hotplug notifier as well...
Maybe both - neither are performance critical code.
