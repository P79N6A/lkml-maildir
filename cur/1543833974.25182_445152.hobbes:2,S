Hi,
I'm wondering if this is entirely the wrong level of abstraction; to me
it feels the subarch shouldn't override the actual cpuid, but the cpu
feature flags that linux uses. That's a lot less messy: cpuid has many
many pieces of information which are near impossible to filter in
practice, however filtering the USAGE of it is trivial; linux basically
flattens the cpuid namespace into a simple bitmap of "what the kernel
can use". That is really what the subarch should filter/fixup, just like
we do for cpu quirks etc etc.
