Optimize for both. It's a catch all setting for future changes
and does not do too much right now.
It also won't pass any -mcpu=... arguments to gcc. This currently
doesn't make any difference (gcc x86-64 default is to optimize
for K8), but I assume it might at some point when gcc gets
a "combined" mode that optimizes for both Intel and AMD CPUs.
