Subject: [patch][1/4] ibmasm driver: fix command buffer size

Hi,
here are four patches for the ibmasm driver.
(that is the driver for the IBM xSeries RSA service processor)
The patches are against the 2.6.16-rc6 kernel. 
To summarize what they do:
[1] change a #define for the buffer size for commands
[2] Fix a bug where threads in the event handling code calling
wait_event_interruptible() weren't woken up as expected.
[3] Redesigned how remote mouse and keyboard events received by the
driver are handled. 
[4] Fixed a race in the command reference counting logic.
Please apply.
Here is the first one:
