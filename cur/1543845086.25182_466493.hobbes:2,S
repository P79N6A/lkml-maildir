metoo!  I'd suggest that it'd be better to be expending the grey cells on
making the present suspend stuff nice and solid, stable and fast.
I mean, right now a suspend-to-disk spends more time futzing around doing
mysterious-but-probably-pointless stuff than it does writing memory to
disk.  I've no idea what it's doing with all that time, but I'll wager it's
not very useful to anyone ;)
