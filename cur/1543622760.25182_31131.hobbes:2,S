Who knows. "Random lockup" you can start at the power supply and work right
through the software - without any more info its very hard to debug

These are OK

Your BIOS vendor didn't even fill in the MP1.1 table with their info - 
confidence level in BIOS _zero_

Curious but should be harmless

HT but not hyperthreading activated in the kernel (acpismp=force). Again
harmless just might be costing performance if your box is HT capable

The unknown resource should be fine. The UDMA33 may well be because the
ide code in the base tree isnt up on i860 hardware yet.
Starting points I'd suggest:
	=	Try a non highmem kernel
	=	See if a single CPU kernel is reliable
		If it is consider swapping the cpus over and retesting
		(might point to software or hardware)
	=	Ensure your ventilation is fine and your PSU is approved
		and to spec for the system
You might want to run a memory test but thats normally seen as random
corruption/oopses not a hang and if you have ECC ram life should be fine
