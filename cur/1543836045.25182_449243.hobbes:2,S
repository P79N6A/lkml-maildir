I think making the userspace data structure not require any compat
handling is a must, thanks for pointing this out Zach.

Agreed.

Yes, it loses badly, that's why we undid this in the routing cache
and just have a fixed sized array of locks which is hashed into.
For kevents, I think a single spinlock initially is fine and
if we hit performance problems on SMP we can fix it.  We should
not implement complexity we have no proof of needing yet :)

It is probably groundwork for the mmap() ring buffer... :)
