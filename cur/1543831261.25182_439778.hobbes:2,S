Hi,
With the recent -git on my box (Asus L5D, x86_64 SUSE 10) the powersave
demon is apparently unable to get the battery status, although the data in
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0 seem to be correct.  As a result, battery status
notification via kpowersave doesn't work and it's hard to notice when the
battery is low/critical.
So far I have verified that this feature works fine with 2.6.17-git3 and
doesn't work with 2.6.17-git6 (-git5 doesn't compile here).
I'll try to get more information tomorrow (unless someone in the know has
an idea of what's up ;-) ).
Greetings,
Rafael
