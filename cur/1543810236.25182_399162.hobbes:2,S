NUMA depends on SMP.
Therefore, if you select NUMA, you have to ensure that SMP is enabled.

NUMAQ can't be hidden since it doesn't has any dependencies.
And this isn't what this comment is talking about (note the the 
comment is only shown if NUMAQ was already select'ed).
NUMAQ didn't fulfill the contract that when select'ing NUMA, it has to 
ensure the dependencies of NUMA are fulfilled. My patch solves this 
properly instead of telling the user through a comment that he ran into 
this bug.
