Yes.

I reverted your patch, reloaded the modules, unloaded thermal, checked
readings with "sensors" (OK), started ksensors:  1.) Its "Mainboard
sensors" config panel is gone.  2.) The problem of the fan divider
oscillating between 8 and 128 is gone.  Fan speeds are now correct all
the time.

I found two differences:  Gentoo's udev init script autoloads thermal on
boot under 2.6.23-rc2 but it doesn't under 2.6.22(-rc5), for a reason
unknown to me.  If I manually load thermal under 2.6.22(-rc5), the
oscillation happens too --- also in the rythm of ksensors' update
interval but with a slightly different partition into div = 8 periods
and div = 128 periods.  Ksensors then happens to display the correct div
= 8 reading, while sensors shows either the wrong or the correct reading
depending on the moment it is issued.  By playing with the update
intervals in ksensors, ksensors can be tricked into getting the correct
value under 2.6.23-rc2 too.
So, it isn't really a regression from 2.6.22 to 2.6.23-rc1.  It merely
became more apparent after 2.6.23-rc1.
And yes, "cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature" causes the CPU
fan divider to flip to 128 immediately.
