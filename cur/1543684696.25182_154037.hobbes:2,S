	The 4G patch has changed the 'ldt' member of mm_context_t, calling it 
'ldt_pages'. Patch from Raphael fixes fpu_system.h for correct 
compilation, but system won't boot with 'no387' parameter. So semantics 
must have been changed too.
	Maybe Ingo can review the effects of his changes on FPU emulation code.
