Hi!
Well, I did a very similar patch about 2.3.3x and it got even
included in -acXX during a Linus vacation - but it got dropped for
some reason (f.i. such an approach does not work well for multi-file
modules, I was told). I re-sent it during the 2.4.0-test phase and
got no reply, so I think just adding __setup() stuff manually to
every module seems the way to go... :(
