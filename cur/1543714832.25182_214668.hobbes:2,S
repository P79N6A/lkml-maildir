Trond,
Can you explain how this works?
static int __init root_nfs_parse(char *name, char *buf)
{
...
        while ((p = strsep (&name, ",")) != NULL) {
                int token;
                if (!*p)
                        continue;
                token = match_token(p, tokens, args);
                /* %u tokens only */
                if (match_int(&args[0], &option))
                        return 0;
Firstly, as far as I can see, args[] is uninitialised.  If match_token
doesn't touch args[] then we pass match_int some uninitialised kernel
memory.
Secondly, we seem to exit if match_int doesn't parse a number.  Not
all options in "tokens" have a number associated with them, including
ones like "tcp".
So, given that "tcp" is the only option, I think we'll end up passing
match_int() some uninitialised memory which may cause a kernel oops.
If not, it probably won't be a valid number, so we'll ignore the option.
However, it will appear to work as long as the first option has a
number associated with it (ie, is one of the first 9 options.)
