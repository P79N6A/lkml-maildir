Very, very wrong. The tasklist scans hold the read side of the lock
and aren't even what's running with interrupts off. The contenders
on the write side are what the NMI oopser oopses.
And supposing the arch reenables interrupts in the write side's
spinloop, you just get a box that silently goes out of service for
extended periods of time, breaking cluster membership and more. The
NMI oopser is just the report of the problem, not the problem itself.
It's not a false report. The box is dead for > 5s at a time.

And that makes it wrong on both counts. The above fails any time
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4 is used, we well as when actual Linux features
are used directly.
