Sure.  In the network namespace case I think the careful ordering of the
shutdown handles that case.   Even with per network namespace lo
unregistered it still existed until the network namespace actually
exited.  And it only happened on exit.  
So while there may be a tiny race there it hasn't been an issue yet
in practice.
I wasn't proposing that we fix it this way.  I was simply saying that
there was the possibility for the case to exist.  The existence of
a per network namespace loopback device is fairly fundamental to the
network namespace concept.  Heck I think Herbert has been looking at
it for vserver which almost totally socket isolation.
