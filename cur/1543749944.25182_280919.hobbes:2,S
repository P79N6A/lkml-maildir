Hi,
  I'm using Fedora Core 2. In
/usr/src/linux-2.6.5-1.358/Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt,
in the 'How to extract the documentation' subsection,
it says:
If you just want to read the ready-made books on the
various subsystems (see Documentation/DocBook/*.tmpl),
just type 'make psdocs', or 'make pdfdocs', or 'make
htmldocs', depending on your preference.
  Then, on the command line, I type the following
commands:
cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-1.358/Documentation/DocBook 
<ENTER>
make pdfdocs  <ENTER>
  But the system says the following:
make: *** No rule to make target `scripts/kernel-doc',
needed by `/wanbook.sgml'.  Stop.
  Then, what's the matter? How actually can I
transform the *.tmpl in Documentation/DocBook into pdf
files? 
  Thank you.

Best Regards,
Park Lee
