I've seen it work. I don't claim it's the best general solution. But
it can and does work in some circumstances, and is favourable to using
directories.

No, I didn't say that. What I'm saying is that the most common user
who wants to see albods as atomic is sitting behind a GUI.
Command-line users who want to see albods as atomic can use some
special tools, or perhaps switches to existing tools.
But absolutely no way should the kernel/libc translate directory-based
albods into pseudo-files.

Sure. But I wonder how well it would be received in the developer
community, compared to a plain library that provided the functionality
on top of the existing raw interface?
I personally would not want to use such a system. I would however be
quite happy to use a GUI that makes things "easier", and some new
command-line tools or switches to existing ones.
You might win over GUI users, who would never notice the difference.
But power users will curse you. Actually, being Linux they'll develop
their own scheme :-)

You're welcome. I really appreciate your work on reiserfs. From what
I've read about it, it looks like the best thing since sliced bread. I
can't wait for it to go into the kernel and play with it.
But I really think any scheme that tries to pretend (at the lowest
levels) that directories are file is flawed. Not only does it
introduce complexities and compatibility problems, I fundamentally
think it is a *less* convenient approach.
Sometimes, you really want to get in at the raw interface and play
with things.
