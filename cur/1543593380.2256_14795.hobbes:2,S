I see, but even so, in linux-2.2 this arbitrary constant allows a non
realtime task to migrate, and totally prohibits it in linux-2.4 (unless
some other cpu is idle).
i.e. maybe there is no relation between the max value of the static 
priority and PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY, but you get a scheduler that behaves
quite differently when you change one without the other.
I think that if it's indeed an arbitrary value, then it should have 
been modified along with the modification of the quantum's length,
because this way the 2.2 behavior (which I assume somebody adopted for
a reason) would have remained the same.
However, if you say that PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY does somehow embody the
cpu-time wasted because of migration (due to cache etc.) regardless of
the quantum's length, then PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY should probably remain 
the same and I got my answer.
Is this what you mean ?
thanks, Dan.
