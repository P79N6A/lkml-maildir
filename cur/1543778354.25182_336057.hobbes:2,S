Once I've finished the generic netlink attribute macros the
usage will be even simpler. I wrote down all the things I want
to do today in a park and I intend to write the code once I'm
back from my vacation.

My patches will include a new function netlink_nr_subscribers()
taking the socket and a mask of groups. I posted something
simliar during an earlier connector discussion already.

My solution to this (in the same patchset) is that we never
derference u64s but instead copy them.

Great, this is one of the remaining issues I haven't solved yet.
If you want me to take over just hand over your unfinished work
and I'll integrate it into my patchset.
I'm sorry to not being able to provide any code yet, it's
one of the first things I'll do once I'm back.
