I wanted to do this a bit differently - I was going to make cpu_die be
a platform-specific function called via a ppc_md function pointer,
rather than putting very pseries-specific stuff in smp.c, which is
used on all platforms.  But having been on vacation and then
travelling, I haven't got to it yet.
