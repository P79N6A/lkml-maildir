Needs parentheses around the whole thing.
This should go into include/linus/kernel.h, after labs(), methinks.

hm.  If we really need a 64-by-64 divide then it shouldn't be hidden in a dvb
driver, please.   I bet we have a few in the tree already, actually.
So it'd be appreciated if someone could take a shot at generating a generic
version of this.  It'll need to be inlined for 64-bit arches, out-of-line
for 32-bit.
It'll also need to be permanently wired into the kernel, alas.  We cannot
tell at compile time whether it'll be needed :(   EXPORT_SYMBOL() it.
