Hi,
what do you mean about two leds? The first one would be
off/0.5Hz and the other off/1Hz?
I read in linux/Documentation/led-class.txt the following:
| Some leds can be programmed to flash in hardware. As this
isn't a generic
| LED device property, this should be exported as a device
specific sysfs
| attribute rather than part of the class if this
functionality is required.
Does it mean that neither the input subsystem nor the led
subsystem is designed for hardware acelerated blinking leds?
Is there any usual way what attribute a hw accelerated
blinking LED_MAIL should export?
