FLAME Protection ON....
  WARNING -- Do not read if you are humor impaired.
Euro-centric here?
 
   The US is mm/dd/yy or mm/dd/yyyy
   Many countries/religions/peoples have different base years, and
calendars...
It happens to have a US format in the current kernel... so what...
Convert it in the user processes...  
And no... I can't even buy A4 paper.
Let's see....  In one evening ...
  Get American attributes out of
     Temperature
     Time
     Date
And replace with European standards.
Next week... change all comments to
Esperanto.
A year from now everything gets converted to Chinese with a 12 year
horoscope date cycle. 
Then....   The great Hindu hack
 Followed by the Orthodox date change ...
 Others follow suit....
It reaches its zenith in the great Inca knot display that only obscure
researchers can read and is then destroyed in when the Knot Printer
tangles up the legs of every computer user on the planet.....
MEANWHILE... M$ developed a bug free product while all the linux hackers
were rewriting the comments and I/O....
FLAME Protection OFF!
