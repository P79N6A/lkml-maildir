"flush" means what to you?
write-back
write-back-and-invalidate
discard-and-invalidate
All 3 behaviors are useful to me, and a few more. I've been
using chunks of PowerPC assembly. Using PowerPC mnemonics...
dcba -- allocate a cache block with undefined content
dcbf -- write to RAM, then invalidate ("data cache block flush")
dcbi -- invalidate, discarding any data
dcbst -- initiate write if dirty
dcbt -- prefetch, hinting about future load instructions
dcbtst -- prefetch, hinting about future store instructions
dcbz -- allocate and zero a cache block (cacheable mem only!)
So dcbf_range() and dcbi_range() sound good to me. :-)
