In addition to "From: ", you can place "Subject: " and "Date: "
at the beginning to make sure Linus or whoever applies patches
would not get the authorship information from the e-mail itself
you send (this is especially true when you are forwarding
somebody else's patch).
Mnemonic is that the equivalents to E-mail headers go at the
top.  You will never have Signed-off-by:, Tested-by:, nor
Acked-by: in your e-mail headers.  They go at the bottom.
	This is just a toolsmith speaking, I am not in any way
	trying to set a policy for this list.
I do not know where that Cc: near S-o-b: comes from, though.  It
is not accepted at the top as there is no place for such an
information in commits.
