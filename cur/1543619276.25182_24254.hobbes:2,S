It's possible in that we can generate regular diffs for any range of
any files.  Cort used to do this all the time to send a subset of the
tree to Linus as a regular patch, talk to him about getting his scripts.
Or talk to Paul, I suspect he does it as well.

Indeed.  We're painfully aware of this.

So here's the deal on this topic.  The out of order thing is a much
bigger deal for a large open source project than it is for our commercial
customers.  It's also hard to do correctly, it would take at least a
month.  Linus has flirted with using BitKeeper multiple times and then
gotten distracted.  If we had dropped everything and fixed the issues he
needs fixed rather than the issues our commercial customers need fixed,
we'd be out of business and you'd have the lovely task of trying to make
this work in the BitKeeper source.  You can believe me or not, but you'd
have very little chance of getting it to work, the BK source base is 
a lot larger and more complex than the generic part of the Linux kernel.
If enough of the kernel people start using BitKeeper and demanding the
out of order stuff, we'll do it.  The lead time is about a month, so
you have to deal with that.  On the other hand, if this turns into yet
another kernel "she loves, she loves me not, she loves me, she loves me
not" about BK, we're not going to fix the out of order stuff until it
is the most important issue for our commercial customers.
Hopefully, you'll take this in the spirit in which it is intended.
We want to help out the kernel team, that was the reason for writing
BitKeeper.  We have to survive, however, and that means paying attention
to the commercial needs as well.  If/when it looks like Linus & Co are
serious about using BK, I'll staff a couple of people to address the 
out of order stuff and commit to a delivery date.  It's clear that it
is the biggest "gotcha" about BK & the kernel work flow.
