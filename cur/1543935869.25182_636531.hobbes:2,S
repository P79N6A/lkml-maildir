You told Christoph that just using direct-IO from kernel still doesn't
give you the required behaviour... What about queueing the IO directly
*and* using direct-IO? I guess it still has to go through the underlying
filesystem, but that's probably a good thing.

Just a quick question (I haven't looked closely at the code): how come
you are using a prio tree for extents? I don't think they could be
overlapping?
