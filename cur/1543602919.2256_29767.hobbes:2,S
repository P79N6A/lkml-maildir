I was using scsi emulation (when I first switched to 2.4.x kernels because I 
was forced to when I ran to the above 2.4.x/bug/2.2.xworks ok ide problem . I 
have two problems with that. First, I use loadline exclusively for booting 
form DOS C: drive and from a ls-120 resue disk. To use scsi emu. I have to 
add hdc=ide-scsi to the boot params of the loadline command line for a 
machine with the tape drive on the secondary/master interface. I have three 
different machines and so the first issue is can't use the same same loadlin 
script for all machines (unless they all have the drive connected to the same 
interface [hdc, for example]). But the second [and more] drastic problem is 
scsi emu. simply stoped working all together in 2.4.5 (and higher 2.4.x 
kernels) for my HP 8 gig drive(s). Also, I might add I don't thing anyone 
shoud be forced to used scsi emu. for an ide drive - that should be an option.
