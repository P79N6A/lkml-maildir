I have disabled (don't ask me why, it was not my decision) the raid 
controller.
I had a look at the old (2.2.18) config and I see the SCSI_MEGA_RAID is 
torned on, while I forgot this with the new kernel.
I thought that, having the raid controller disabled in the bios, I don't need 
it anymore. But probably I'm in fail...
As soon as I can (probably next week) I try another time.
Do you think that this could be the problem?
If yes, so why it have some problem with:
PCI: cannot allocate resource region 0 for 0:1.4
I remember that according to lspci of kernel 2.2.18:
01:04.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100]
01:06.0 SCSI storage controller: Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 53c895
01:07.0 SCSI storage controller: Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 53c895

Well I have only 512Mb for the moment, so I don't think this is the problem.
Anyway, thanks a lot.
