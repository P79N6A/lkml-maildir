:Hmm, it looks like something strange is going on.  Perhaps the serial driver
:isn't matching to the device.
Well, it's certainly able to identify the device as a serial device. (I've
sent this message using the modem over a regular PPP link . . .)
:Could I see the output of the following:
:
:#mkdir /sys
:#mount -t sysfs none /sys
:#cd /sys/bus/pnp/devices
:#find */* | xargs cat       <------
Without isapnptools interfering:
