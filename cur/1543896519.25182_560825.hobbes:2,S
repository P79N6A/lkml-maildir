I copy in the g5_defconfig and then do my "make oldconfig".   which
eventually prompts with:
	Macintosh device drivers (MACINTOSH_DRIVERS) [N/y] (NEW)     
But I see what got me..    The g5_defconfig hasnt been updated since
before the MACINTOSH_DRIVERS option was added back in April; so I have
no old setting to carry over into the new.
Unless someone beats me to it, I'll spin up a new g5_defconfig via the
ppc-dev list shortly.   :-)
