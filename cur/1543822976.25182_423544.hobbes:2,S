Thanks for the patch.  However, did you not get my very last message?
Checking back through my mail logs, I think it might not have been
delivered.
After claiming that the dma mask fixed the problem, I quickly
discovered that the dma was not what did it.  Thus the patch you sent
does not work.
But, here is what does: If I rmmod ehci_hcd and then modprobe
ehci_hcd, it works, and I get full USB 2.0 speed.  There must be
something happening in the clean-up code of the the ehci_hcd  that
fixes whatever conflict I'm having.  When I originally made that patch
and then reloaded the ehci_hcd module to test it, I mistakenly thought
that it was the patch that was fixing the problem.  I should have
tested more thoroughly before sending the e-mail, but I got very
excited.  Sorry about that.  After several days of using the
rmmod/modprobe workaround, I do feel confident that it is a legitimate
fix.
