Perhaps one could use something based on the way squid currently does
that task.
 1. If the URL has a ? anywhere within it, squid assumes it to be a
    dynamic URL.
 2. One of squid's configuration parameters specifies a collection of
    directory names which, if found in the URL with / on either side
    of them, and with at least one element after them, are taken as
    indicating that the URL in question is a DYNAMIC one.
 3. Any URL not satisfying one of the above rules is taken to be a
    static one.
Rule 1 is simply a case of...
 Q> if (index(url,'?') != NULL)
 Q>	dynamic = TRUE;
...and rule 2 suggests the use of /proc/sys/khttpd as a file to
specify the directory names to look for in rule 2, with the default
contents being the same as the squid defaults.
Best wishes from Riley.
