Congratulations!  This looks beautiful.  I really do think you've
wiped out the intellectual property roadblock that's been holding Linux
back from penetrating the control system space at the same rate as
traditional IT.  Not to mention that I can look forward to a sound
system where I can be *sure* my mp3s won't skip.
In my opinion, this is fundamental progress for free (as in freedom)
software.
