You can push a BPF (LPF) filter expression onto a LISTEN socket that checks
every incoming packet using SO_ATTACH_FILTER.
The only way to do it fully in an application is probably to set up netfilter
NAT to forward the connection to some local process; or alternative push
the packets using a netfilter queue target to a user process and forward/
disable firewall rules dynamically.
