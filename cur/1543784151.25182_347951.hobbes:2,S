Sorry missed pointing that out. We are using IPX. I don't think it'll
be that easy to switch to anything other :/

Both systems are local and therefore thats not the difference,
between them.

Well i can imagine that IPX is much worse than UDP ("IPX just sucks").
Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be that easy to switch that system
over to UDP, cause the Novell Server is in center of a whole system,
which has to be highly available, so we don't want to touch it.

Uhmm... then remains the question: Why should that happen on the first
machine but not on the second?

Well - i'm using IPX. So where do i insert the printk()s? And what kind
of printk()s should i insert? Please don't think of me as an idiot,
but i'm just not firm with "kernel hacking".
