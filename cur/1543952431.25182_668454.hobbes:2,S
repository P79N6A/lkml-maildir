Hi Olof,
Looks good, makes me want to go back and cleanup iop-adma a bit.  A
few fyi's below, but no other review comments.

Ok, it still may not compile in mainline until after 2.6.26-rc1 due to
additional dmaengine cleanups like the ack-to-flags change I posted
earlier.  Any better way to handle this?  Go through -mm?

Clients do not submit new operations in their callback routines so it
is "ok" to hold this lock over the callback.
Also, if your platform will need to support channel switching at some
point you can go ahead and add a call to async_tx_run_dependencies()
here.
