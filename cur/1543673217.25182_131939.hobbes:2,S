Hmmm, and are you sure that nothing can cause CCP to go down?  If it
does then ppp_generic will send data uncompressed.  What would happen
if an attacker managed to insert a CCP terminate-request into the
receive stream somehow?
I think the whole thing needs a careful audit.  The idea that you fall
back to sending and receiving uncompressed data if CCP goes down or a
compressor fails is pretty fundamental to the CCP implementation in
ppp_generic.
