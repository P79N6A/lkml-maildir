At the moment we are adding a lot of 2.6 stuff to the DRM under
development in the DRM CVS tree and what will be merged into the -mm and
Linus trees eventually, this has meant ifdefing stuff out so 2.4 will
still work,
At some point we are going to make a change that will break 2.4, and I
won't be able to patch it up nicely...
So the question is do we want to a final stable DRM for 2.4 in the next
2.4 release? and after that point I can tag the 2.4 release in the DRM CVS
tree (and maybe branch it ...),
Dave.
