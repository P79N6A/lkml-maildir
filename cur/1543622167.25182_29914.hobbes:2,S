ah thank you, those settings work nicely.  turns out i had a bad
motherboard.  the new one seems rock solid (after one day).  redhat 7.2
kernels 2.4.7-10 and 2.4.9-21 worked for me, as does 2.4.18-rc4.  
so if anyone else is having trouble with an asus a7m266d *with the
proper bios settings*, its possible (likely?) you've got a bad
motherboard.

ps- for the record my stable configuration includes 2 AMD Athlon(TM) XP
1900+, matrox g200, intel eepro100, hdd, and floppy.
