Note, everyone else, that the freezing only happens on "make autoprobe".
The config.out that "make autoconfigure" writes is not frozen.

Correction: menuconfig *does* save out frozen symbols, but it saves
them unfrozen.

This "workaround" is entirely intentional.

Actually, this kind of cross-configuration is already fully supported.
The normal way of calling the configurator, through the Makefile,
passes -D$(ARCH) -- but if you call it without an architecture symbol
frozen by command-line option, architecture will be the first question
you're asked.
