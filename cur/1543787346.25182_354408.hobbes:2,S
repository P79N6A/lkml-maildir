Hello,
An updated version of the kernel patch I released yesterday
is available. It fixes the following problems:
	- compilation errors on Fedora Core 4 with gcc-4.x (reported by John Reiser)
	- range restriction not working on Itanium processors.
	- time-based event set switching not working on X86-64
You can grab the new release at:
