Thanks.
Everything looks fine here.
The only difference of any significance between the working and
non-working configurations is that in the non-working, the component
devices are larger than 2Gig, and hence have sector offsets greater
than 32 bits.
This does cause a slightly different code path in one place, but I
cannot see it making a difference.  But maybe it does.
What architecture is this running on?
What C compiler are you using?
Can you try with this patch?  It is the only thing that I can find
that could conceivably go wrong.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
