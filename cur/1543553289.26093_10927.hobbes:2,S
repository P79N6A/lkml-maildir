Actually the first people to do exactly that were Debian, who shipped a compiler
that couldnt reliably build a kernel for the time period. Thats one of the
reasons they put in gcc272. 
Its good sense to tie large critical pieces of hard to validate code to the
compiler. There is a reason you'll find any good software company maintains
old releases in archives with the build environment to reproduce them exactly
