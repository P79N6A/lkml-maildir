Doublechecking indicates my initial test was wrong somehow; both
card->dev->parent and card->parent passed as arg 2 to the
device_create call in snd_register_device result in correct device
symlinks. Are these two actually semantically different?  I'm just
curious.
The call to device_create in cound_core.c:sound_insert_unit also needs
to be modified in order for the device symlinks in the other unit
types to be correct.  Again, modifying the 'dev' argument to
'(dev?dev->parent:NULL)' appears to fix the problem.  Is that
correct/appropriate there?
