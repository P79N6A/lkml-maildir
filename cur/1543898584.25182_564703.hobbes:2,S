What do you do if a task not yet frozen writes to a pipe, on the other
end of which is a task already frozen?
It doesn't matter.  The only thing that should matter during suspend
(not hibernate) is saving the state of devices to ram, and putting the
devices to sleep.
I'm not sure why this can't be made atomic, but assuming, that it
can't, fuse should still not need to be implicated.  If it is, that's
an indication about something wrong in the suspend procedure.
