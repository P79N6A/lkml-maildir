Yes.  and I re-read it.
There are several things in Keith's email that make sense:
a.  all RAS tools should use a common interface
b.  it's not the kernel's job to decide which RAS tool runs first
Eric makes some good points too.  I'm mostly similar to Eric:
paranoid about trusting software/hardware after a panic (or oops).
So if someone wants to use multiple RAS tools on a panic event,
enabling an admin to set priorities is OK with me, but I'll only
trust the first one that is used, and even that one may have
problems.  IOW, I don't see a big need to support multiple RAS
tools at one time.  (speaking for myself)

Ack that.
