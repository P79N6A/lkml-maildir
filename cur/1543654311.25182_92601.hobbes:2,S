That's wrong. It's essential, since the following happens:
static void __devexit my_remove()
{
}
static struct pci_driver my_driver = {
	.name		= "my",
	.probe		= my_probe,
	.remove		= __devexit_p(my_remove),
};
For CONFIG_HOTPLUG set, __devexit == "" and __devexit_p(x) == x,
so everything's obviously fine.
For CONFIG_HOTPLUT not set, my_remove gets discarded from vmlinux, so we 
cannot set my_driver.remove = my_remove, since that symbol doesn't even 
exist anymore. Older binutils quietly accepted this, but recent ones
correctly barf. That's why in that case __devexit_p(x) == NULL, so
my_remove isn't referenced. It's not a debugging feature of ld, it's just
correct behavior and it's not possible to turn it off.

Since in that case driver->remove == NULL, that gives you a nice oops
when trying to invoke it, no need for an explicit invoke_bug ;)

Again, that doesn't fix the problem that we have a reference to a symbol 
which doesn't exist since we just discarded it.
One way to fix this is to make my_remove a weak symbol, so that the linker
just silently puts in NULL when it's not defined elsewhere, which would
avoid the ugly __devexit_p(). Not sure if that doesn't end up in even 
uglier hacks, though.
Another way to fix this is of course to always have CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y,
which may become necessary anyway when properly shutting down devices at
shutdown/reboot.
