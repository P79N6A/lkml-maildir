OTOH, there are rumors that PCI resource management has been
vastly improved in XP. I believe Alan and Russell tried that
with rather long chain of of bridges using PCI expansion
chassis and windows had no problems with it.
Not sure about details though (i.e. what version of windows
and whether additional drivers were required or not).
