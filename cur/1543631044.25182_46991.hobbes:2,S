OK, a question and a remark:
1) does memclass_related_bhs() work if the bufferheads are
   on another node ?  (NUMA-Q)
2) memclass_related_bhs() will definately not work if the
   data structure is pinned indirectly, say struct address_space
   which is pinned by mere the existance of the page cache page
   and cannot easily be freed
