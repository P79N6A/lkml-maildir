Linux should be able to do something like this using unionfs.  It could
be worthwhile to try it with one of the very fastest flash cards or USB
drives.
With slower cards and USB keys its more of a loss unless the faster seek
speed can make up for it, because sequential hard drive access is
faster.
For comparison, a OCZ USB 2.0 Flash Drive with dual channel works at
about 30 MB/s.  One of my 7,200 RPM SATA desktop drives does 45 MB/s.  A
15k SCSI drive can do over 60 MB/s.
It'd be great for laptops though.  My slug of a laptop drive does 20
MB/s on a good day.
