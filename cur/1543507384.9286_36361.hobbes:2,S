Actually, not so bad idea would be to explain me what is IPVS. 8)
Alan, patches floating around and including different checks
for IFF_NOARP, IFF_UP, calls to ip_dev_find() etc. are wrong.
They break more things than repair.
I do not understand the problem for now and, hence, cannot react
more constructively.
