		    ips_command_direction[scb->scsi_cmd->cmnd[0]];
        /* Allow a WRITE BUFFER Command to Have no Data */
        /* This is Used by Tape Flash Utilites          */
        if ((scb->scsi_cmd->cmnd[0] == WRITE_BUFFER) && (scb->data_len == 0)) 
            scb->dcdb.cmd_attribute = 0;                  
		if (!(scb->dcdb.cmd_attribute & 0x3))
			scb->dcdb.transfer_length = 0;
		if (scb->data_len >= IPS_MAX_XFER) {
