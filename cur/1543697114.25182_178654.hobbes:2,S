The question is, does that make your testing better or worse in terms of
checking the new code? Clearly you have done a good job of checking the
"disk can't keep up" case, is there a need to test further with a much
higher transaction rate?
I would assume that if there were lock issues they would have shown up,
which is probably all that's needed.
