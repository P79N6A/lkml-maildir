It may be worth having a definitive and unambiguous Author: tag then, 
which can appear among Signed-off-by:s and is used in preference to 
anything else.  From: is a useful heuristic which seems to work well in 
general, but as you say, it gets a bit hairy when you have something 
which means different things to different parts of the software stack at 
the same time.
