Hi Christoph,
	Thanks for the pointers, but as you've been debating for 18 months now,
no patches are in the -mm tree or obviously about to go in, and this new
helper function is orthogonal to your work, I don't think it's
reasonable to delay this patch.
	All we can reasonably do is push this function back into the xen part
of the kernel tree for now.
Rusty.
