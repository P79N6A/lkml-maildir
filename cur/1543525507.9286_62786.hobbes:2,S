   Why is it #ifdef __sparc__ and not __BIG_ENDIAN? Looks more like an
   endian issue to me from that patch? Nobody used 3c59x's in PPC boxen?
__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD is the proper macro, not __BIG_ENDIAN
The former has to do with how bit fields are layed out in
structured in memory, the latter is an intrinsic about the
byte ordering within words on the machine.
