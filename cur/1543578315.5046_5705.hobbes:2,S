Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0 agpgart with i815 and external card.

My problem was that I didn't pay enough attention to the configuration
options. I opted for *both* the 440LX/BX/GX, 815, 840, 850 support
(CONFIG_AGP_INTEL) *and* I810/I815 (on-board) support (CONFIG_AGP_I810).
The latter was taking precedence over the former, and getting confused.
Petr Vandrovec has made the very good point that, to stop others from
getting as confused as me, agpgart should default to generic intel if it
can't find the onboard i815 video card.
It's a very small patch (one line really) which I present for your
consideration.
Thanks to Alan Cox and Petr for putting me right.
