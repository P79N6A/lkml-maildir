Yuck.  That's revolting and extremely fragile.  Don't play these games.
You've got plenty of free flag bits in clk->flags which could be used
to prevent the DPLL from being changed.  You've also got other ways to
prevent it - eg, setting dpll_data to NULL.
To do exception handling based on strcmp(), or even worse register offset
and bit position (as is done elsewhere in the OMAP code) is utterly insane.
However, what's worse is that, below...

The return value from the above test isn't checked, so this function
will succeed even for dpll4_ck.
