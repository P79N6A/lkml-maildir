USB, or strictly speaking EHCI, OHCI and UHCI, use DMA. To allow
that the cache coherency logic has to be active. Therefore your CPU
cannot go to C3. Therefore it draws more power. The problem we are
facing in USB is that to get great savings, our coverage has to be perfect.
One device that cannot be autosuspended and we lose most savings.
