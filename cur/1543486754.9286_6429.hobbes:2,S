Hi guys,
I wonder if anyone knows how this is done? I noticed that using mount -t
with a VFS driver automatically loads the appropriate module/driver within
the kernel, for example, on my system the modules msdos.o, fat.o are
automatically loaded when I type in mount -t msdos /floppy. 
I am currently writing a module that needs to load as a filesystem driver,
and I was wondering how I can get that to autoload when someone does
something like mount -t carddrive /dev/mnt. 
What I am trying to accomplish is getting my old Atari Portfolio's memory
card to be read/written via my card drive adapter that connects to a card
within my PC. That would enable me to transfer data to/from my PC via the
memory cards to my very old Portfolio.
Of course, I can just use the Portfolio as a terminal, but this is quite
interesting =)
Cheers,
Alex
