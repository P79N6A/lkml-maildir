You can look in /proc/PID/maps to see where memory-mapped
stuff exists. PID is the process-ID number.
You can also use printf("%p\n", function); to get the
offset of any function in your code. Using this same
method, you can also print the offset of anything that
can be labeled in your code.
These offsets are only useful for mental
masturbation. If your application needs to know
the layout of its code and data it is severely
broken and needs to be fixed. All data elements
are accessible using conventional language methods
such as pointers, array elements, and structure
members.
