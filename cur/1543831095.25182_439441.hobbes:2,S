I tried adding "delayed allocation" for ext3 earlier. Yes. VFS level
infrastructure would be nice. But, I haven't found much that we can
do at VFS - which is common across all the filesystems (except
mpage_writepage(s) handling). Most of the stuff is specific to 
filesystem implementation (even though it could be common) - coming
out with VFS level interfaces to suite all the different filesystem
delalloc would be *interesting* exercise.
If you have ideas on what are the common/generic stuff we can do in
VFS - I can take a look at it again :)
Thanks,
