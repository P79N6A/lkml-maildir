I have SO 5.01 installed over NFS on my Solaris box. Seems to work 100% -
never had a problem with it - unlike the Linux version which IMHO they
really fucked it up (i.e stupid reliance on glibc-2.0.7 and won't work
properly with glibc-2.1 - and I'm fucking not going to install 2.0.7).
Cheers,
Alex
