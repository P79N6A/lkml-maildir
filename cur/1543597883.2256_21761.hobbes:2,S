On a server which is anything but idle, 16bit pids cycle every 1 or 2
days. And many daemons do get restarted (syslog on RH systems), and they
do fork to perform their task (all from [x]inetd, sendmail, and the like).
PID means nothing, expecially when uptime > 100 days its pretty much a
random number (a lot of chances you already restarted almost everything,
unless your configuration is *very* stable).
