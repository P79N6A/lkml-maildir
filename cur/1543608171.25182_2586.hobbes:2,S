Hi all,
I will get some new servers next week and I have two
questions:
- Does the current kernel support Dual Athlon CPUs ?
- Is it possible to build one kernel for dual Athlon,
single Athlon, dual PIII and single PIII boxes ? 
I would wait until next week and try it out, but
unfortunately our management asked me about a
statement about this :) (They want to be able to swap
server hardware in case one of the servers breaks -
without any software configuration if possible).
Thanks in advance,
Marco Schwarz
