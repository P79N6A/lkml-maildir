Hi,
I am looking for support somewhere in the kernel for my thinkpad x6
ultrabay's cdrom drive.  Whenever I attach the ultrabay it picks up the
extra usb ports, seems to pick up the ethernet port, but it fails to
pick up anything about the dvd/cd-writer.  Nothing shows up in dmesg
about the drive at all... anyone know what I might need in the kernel?
I am using 2.6.17-rc6
Thanks!
George
