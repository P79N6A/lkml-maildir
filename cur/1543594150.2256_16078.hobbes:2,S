hmm... what about processors like cris?  The big brother of the processor
in the cute net-enabled-webcam by axis?  AFAIK it doesn't have an fpu, and
people put a lot of work into getting support for it into 2.4.

Fine, but can you leave in support for my PAS16?

No real problem there...

Wow, thanks for leaving me with no way to console into my netra.
Incidentally, (As if anyone appropriate is actually READING this thread),
can people who make distributions PLEASE not assume there are 3 or 4
serial ports?  I tried installing debian-sparc on my netra and init
warnings about being unable to open the 3rd serial port make menus
unreadable.

Yeah, can we please get rid of ext2?  I mean, everyone's using reiserfs
now, right?  And what about making SMP mandatory?  I mean, who only has
*ONE* processor in a machine in 2001?  And ide and scsi support... ram is
so cheap now who needs disk?  get rid of everything except ramdisk.  tape
drives?  cd burners?  obsolete.  Plus the RIAA doesn't want cd burners
anyway.  Maybe you can get funding for 2.6 kernel development from them
with this plan!
