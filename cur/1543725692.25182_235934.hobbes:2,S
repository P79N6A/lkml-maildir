So instead of even minor numbers indicating stability, you have pushed 
two levels down so that higher sub-revision (minorminorminor?) numbers 
indicate increased levels of stability?
Kinda makes sense.
Does that mean that 2.6.21 and 2.6.20.1 are two separate forks of 
2.6.20, one for development, and the other for stability?
How is this fundamentally different from how it was done before with 
odd/even minor numbers?
It's like the details have been changed to give the illusion that 
development will go faster, when in reality, the fundamental approach 
hasn't really changed.
