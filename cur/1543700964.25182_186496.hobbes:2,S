I'm getting Ooops reports with sungem. The problem is that in the PM
code (and possibly other exceptional code path), it will clean the rings
at non interrupt time but with a spinlock_irq held.
it uses dev_kfree_skb_any() which does:
static inline void dev_kfree_skb_any(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
        if (in_irq())
                dev_kfree_skb_irq(skb);
        else
                dev_kfree_skb(skb);
}
However, in_irq() seem to only catch real IRQ time, so I end up calling
dev_kfree_skb(), which triggers the following BUG() in local_bh_enable()
        WARN_ON(irqs_disabled());
We should probably fix dev_kfree_skb_any() ? Still ugly imho though...
-        if (in_irq())
+        if (in_irq() || irqs_disabled())
Ben.
