What about the legal ramifications in the US of distributing code using
an algorithm that is covered by a patent without permission.  What are
we gonna just not distribute the kernel in the US at all?  Cause that's
the only way to safely do what you all keep blathering about without a
license.  By putting the code in the kernel you are putting us in the US
at risk, someone could argue you are giving people a means to violate a
patent in the US...not something you want to be doing!
