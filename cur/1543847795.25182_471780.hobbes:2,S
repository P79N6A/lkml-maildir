I'm going to apply this after I've confirmed that it fixes the Mac Mini.
It would be nice if somebody documented what the heck that "bit 9" 
actually is that we're trying to preserve. I wonder if that one is any 
better..
It's entirely possible that what we should do in acpi_hw_register_write() 
is to always force SCI_EN to be on, but in the meantime, this would seem 
to be the minimal fix that undoes the damage done by the ACPI merge.
