I have to admit that I suggested making this change, because the
function was sufficently generic looking. I guess the mm == NULL
case should logically return 0... unless you did that, making
page_mapped_by_task use current still leaves the burden of ensuring
->mm != NULL on the caller.
But I don't much mind which way the consensus goes.
