I think a kernel thread is not a choice for me as I truly want to execute
userspace code. As I said before: like a signal handler.

Well I'm talking about really fast networking so every _micro_second I save is
worth it. My numbers are a bit different: Think about a Gigabit-Ethernet card
sending you about 80000 interrupts if it's in a bad mood ;-)
To give you a figure: I'm trying to get below 10 us for user to user latency.
Have a look at the benchmarks at www.myri.com.
thanks anyway ;-)
