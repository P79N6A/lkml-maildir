Doubt it.  
http://www.zfmicro.com/MachZ.htm
 are doing a 486 on a chip,
including Linux support.  It has only just been announced and is
guaranteed to be available for *at least* 5 years, so they will still
be shipped up to 2005 at least.  Once those beasts get heavily used for
embedded systems, what is the chance that many will still be running in
2038?  Fairly high I suspect, embedded systems tend to run for a long
time.
