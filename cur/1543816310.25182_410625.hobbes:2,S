I don't see where we are freeing the shared memory segments,
the message queues and the semaphores when the last user of the namespace
goes away.  Am I missing something?

I believe there is a small problem with this implementation.
per namespace counts and limits are fine.  But I think we want
to maintain true global limits as well.   I know
concerns of that nature have been expressed in regards
to Daves patch.

Again please move the get outside of the tasklist_lock.
