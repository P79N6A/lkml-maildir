Distributions with 2.4 kernels will continue to live on for quite a
while. Red Hat Enterprise Linux has a 5-year support life, during
which we would expect LSI to release new hardware, and we would want
to be able to have that hardware work on that OS somehow.  The driver
source for 2.4 and 2.6 need not be identical, but there *will* be
ongoing maintenance for drivers on 2.4 kernels for the next several
years.  We're <6 months into the RHEL3 supported lifetime.
While I understand the concerns with keeping 2.4 and 2.6 drivers
separate, we can't ignore the maintenance for 2.4 drivers.  If that's
done on a 2.4-only stream, or cleanly with a joint 2.4/2.6 driver, I
don't care, but agree it's difficult to do a clean joint driver,
especially with all the SCSI subsystem changes.
Thanks,
Matt
