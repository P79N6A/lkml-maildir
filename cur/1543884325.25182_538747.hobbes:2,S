Well, poll() level edge semantic is well defined, you cannot cheat or change it.
If many threads call poll() on the same end point, they should *all* return POLLIN/whatever status.
This is why programs usually use one thread to dispatch events to workers, or at least dont queue XXXX threads calling poll() on one fd.
Only system calls that actually returns an 'work_done' can avoid waking all waiting threads and putting them back in queue. Example of such system calls are accept() or read()
