Well, what I'm trying to say is that external build system will always 
break one way or other. Since they're external, they're naturally out of 
reach for me to influence, so there's really nothing I can do it but 
telling people to using the internal system instead.

Again, when you're using your own external build system, it's up to you to 
mess it up in all possible ways, the above being one of them.
When you're using the kernel build, the above cannot happen, since the 
kernel build system knows about this dependency and builds a new 
init/vermagic.o with the correct information before it gets linked into 
the external module.
