Could <installkernel> make part of the kernel scripts, or in one other
standard software package, like modutils, so its versions are controlled
and can be requested (in Doc/ChageLog, like other things) ?
Perhaps it could be put into a kernel-utils package with ksymoops, and
standarise the places and naming. I do not know if systems like Caldera,
SuSE or Debian adopted the /boot place for kernel things (standard kernels
still come with INSTALL_PATH=/boot commented-out), or the
vmlinuz-X.Y.Z naming.
I think the best solution would be to make /boot the 'official' place for
kernels, the -X.Y.Z naming an standard, installkernel should save System.map
and .config.
And you can add something like /proc/signature/map, /proc/signature/config,
etc to md5-check if a certain file fits running kernel.
