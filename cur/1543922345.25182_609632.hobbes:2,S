there is also pleanty of evidence that you don't have to be perfect to be 
good enough.
in addition security is useually traded off for something else 
(useability, administrative effort, money, etc) and depending on what's 
being protected the cost that's appropriate is going to be different.

This is very true, but the solution isn't to try and eliminate everything 
other then perfect security, it's to properly document the limitations of 
various options and educate people about them.
