On a first scan one thing in particular jumped out:
+/*
+ * validate in a user page, so that the kernel can use the kernel direct
+ * mapped vaddr for the physical page to access user data. This locking
+ * relies on the fact that the caller has kernel_lock held, which restricts
+ * kswapd (or anyone else looking for a free page) from running and stealing 
+ * pages. By the same token, grabbing mmap_sem is not needed. 
+ */
Unfortunately, mmap_sem _is_ needed here.  Both find_extend_vma and
handle_mm_fault need it.  You can't modify or block while scanning the
vma list without it, or you risk breaking things in threaded
applications (for example, taking a page fault in handle_mm_fault
without it can be nasty if you are in the middle of a munmap at the
time).
