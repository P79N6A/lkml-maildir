Hello,
I'm not sure what, if any interrelations there are between the various 
versions of glibc, and the kernel.
Specifically, a piece of telecom hardware that we use out in the field 
requires a 2.2.x kernel to compile the drivers, however, after choosing 
an arbitrary "new" release of a linux distro, and downgrading the 
kernel, we are able to compile and install the drivers, and 
subsequently use the hardware.
Are there any URLs/Docs that I could look at to understand what, if any 
relationships glibc, and the kernel have?
thank you!
