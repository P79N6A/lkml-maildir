By the way, there are three or four versions of a pxa27x UDC
driver floating around; which one is this?  One you updated?
It looks like it forked from the pxa2xx driver several years ago
but never got cleaned up ... e.g. it's a different controller,
so none of the comments relevant to earlier controller versions
(pxa250 rev a0 etc) could possibly apply, or even later ones
(like pxa255, effectively end-of-the-line for that UDC).
Quite a lot of the code issues in this driver are inherited from
some rather ancient code dating to ... 2.4.19-rmk7 kernels, if
I don't mis-recall.  Some of them are even specific to the now
obsolete "Lubbock" reference hardware.
In short:  whatever version of a pxa27x_udc driver gets submitted,
much cleanup seems *STILL* to be needed.

The PXA 27x platform devices should really have been in a
different file ... the PXA platform has been rather neglected,
since it effectively has no maintainer.

And *STILL* people carry around comments from the pxa2xx_udc
code (for "x" in 1, 6, and mostly 5).
ISTR that every time someone has submitted a pxa27x driver I've
had to ask that obsolete comments be removed.   Still waiting...

This driver was largely cut'n'paste from pxa2xx_udc, which
had to cope with errata which mostly meant that it couldn't
work.  Then there were *DESIGN BUGS* in the DMA, making it
not worth using in the most significant cases ... even in
the later chip revisions where DMA would allegedly work.
(Which reminds me, maybe I should just rip DMA out of the
pxa2xx_udc code ... nobody seems to have picked it up and
finished it, so there's no point in keeping that around.)
I'm told that DMA works better in pxa27x, and that at least
one version of the pxa27x_udc driver enabled it by default.
(For TX, if not RX where it's most useful...)  This would
seem not to be that version.

The debug file stuff *DOES* have a Kconfig hook...

Not really.  It's an artifact of a rather bizarre FPGA design
on the PXA25x reference design ("Lubbock"), which was very
gratuitously different from what Intel docs recommended.  The
normal case is that there is a single IRQ.
That stuff is long gone even from pxa2xx_udc ... and in any case,
the VBUS irqs should not be called "connect/disconnect", it's
just confusing to do that.

Curious ... did that pxa255 erratum transfer somehow to the
newer pxa27x silicon?

Another comment that shouldn't be relevant on this driver.
ISTR that all PXA 27x chips have CFR.  It was new in PXA255,
which is why the pxa2xx_udc had to cope with its absence.
> HEX_DISPLAY2 gets different treatment from HEX_DISPLAY here.
Yeah, but all that stuff was specific to the Lubbock platform.
Best to just remove it.

That stuff dates from 2.4.19-rmk7 kernel support, which
significantly predates dev_warn().  ;)
