No.
This is a simple disk node.
It serves the md0 array, and uses mem for buffering-caching.
If it reboots, fill the memory on the first couple of minutes, and stay on
full, but this is relatively good.
But 2 question is remaining:
1. why don't use highmem for caching?
2. why can not allocate enough lowmem from shared-buffer for the e1000
driver if it needs some memory?

Janos
