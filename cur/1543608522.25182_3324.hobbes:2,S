Shell programming is great for small programs. You don't need type information
in the language when you can fit it all in your head.
Now, go write 100K lines of shell, something that does something that is not
just shoveling lines from one app into a grep and into another app.  Let's say,
a database.  Go implement the next Oracle replacement in bash, and tell me you
don't care about types in your language.
Why do we have "file formats", well that is because files are just streams
of characters, and we need more structure than just that.
This is exactly what I'm proposing - having "just" files in proc is fine,
but not knowing the type of the information they present is catastrophic.
