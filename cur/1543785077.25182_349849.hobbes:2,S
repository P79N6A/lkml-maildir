Hello lists,
Running kernel 2.6.13.1, no patches.
Yesterday, after putting my laptop into S3 and reviving it at home, the firewire interface was
unusable, no response when plugging in my external disk, loading sbp2 manually didn't trigger anything.
At this point I unloaded the ohci1394 module, and reloaded it:

clearly it didn't really got back it's old state when returning from S3. Rebooting helped, but that's
what i'm trying to avoid by using S3 :p
lspci for the firewire interface:
0000:02:07.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB43AB21 IEEE-1394a-2000 Controller (PHY/Link) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
        Subsystem: Acer Incorporated [ALI]: Unknown device 001f
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 10
        Memory at d0209000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=2K]
        Memory at d0200000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Capabilities: [44] Power Management version 2
I saw this thread: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux1394-user&m=111262313930798&w=2 tho I'm not sure if it's relevant to this.
Any patches I might try? The linux1394.org site still is down, so nothing to dig on there ;)
For the firewire maintainers: great job you're doing on it!
Jan
