Subject: [PATCH] Alpha's Page Granurality Hint support

I made a patch against 2.4.0-test1 ( but worked fine on 2.4.0-test2 also)
that suport Alpha's page granurality hint feature.
See
http://shimizu-lab.et.u-tokai.ac.jp/~nshimizu
for the patch and benchmarks to check the performance.
The Alpha architecture defines Granularity Hint(GH) bits in the
Page Table Entry(PTE). If these bits are set to non-zero value,
it supply a hint to translation buffer implementations that
a block of pages can be treated as a single larger page.
With my patch we will have the opportunity to reduce translation misses.
On a matrix transpose benchmark it will accelerate
the performance about 30 to 40 %. General HPC applications will run 10 to 20%
faster than the normal kernel, I think.
Enjoy,
