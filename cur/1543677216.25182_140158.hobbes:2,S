Wrong. Look at the VFS code. In all cases the test is of the form.
    spin_lock(&dcache_lock);
    /* Are we the sole users of this dentry */
    if (atomic_read(&dentry->d_count) == 1) {
       /* Yes - do some operation */
    }
Knowing that d_lookup() can *increase* d_count is not a plus here. The
whole idea is to have a test for sole use.
In most cases, the "do some operation" above is
	d_drop(dentry);
in order (for instance) to ensure that nobody else can look up this
dentry while we're working on it (e.g. rename or unlink,...).
Your d_lookup() screws the above example of code which you can find in
any number of VFS functions. dput(), d_delete(), d_invalidate(),
d_prune_aliases(), prune_dcache(), shrink_dcache_sb() are but a few
functions that rely on the above code snippet working to keep
d_lookup() from intruding.
