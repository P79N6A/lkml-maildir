The letter about the RCU patent used in GPL software is in on the way to
Linus and a copy is also in my way, so the rcu patent isn't going to be
a problem for linux users.
The rcu-2 version has probably still a bug in call_rcu, it can't harm at
the moment since nobody is recalling call_rcu but we're working on that,
also I need to merge the new updates from Dipankar and also Rusty's
approch with the schedule hook looks attractive after all, so it's work
in progress but as just said the fact it is work in progress cannot harm
anybody so you can apply it safely and in the meantime it has the
advantage of putting more eyes on the code.
