I was hoping to devolve the issue of the implementation of it to arch
maintainers by asking for this. I was vaguely aware that the atomic bit
operations are implemented via hashed spinlocks on PA-RISC and some
others, so by asking for the right primitives to come back up from arch
code I hoped those who spin elsewhere might take advantage of their
window of exclusive ownership.
Would saying "Here is an address, please lock it, and if you must flip
a bit, use this bit" suffice? I thought it might give arch code enough
room to wiggle, but is it enough?
Thanks,
Bill
