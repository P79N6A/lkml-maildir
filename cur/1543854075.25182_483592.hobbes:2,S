OK, I have now tried connecting with firescope to just follow the dmesg
buffer across firewire.  Works great, until the system hangs, then
firescope reports that it couldn't perform the read.  I wonder what part
of the system has to lock up for the firewire card to no longer be able
to read memory on the system.
