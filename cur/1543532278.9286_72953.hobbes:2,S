My reservation about the low-latency patch is 
in the method of fixing these long sections.  If inode reclaim is too
slow, we can either introduce more checks for needs resched or try to
find a smart data structure/algorithm that does the work faster. 
If read/write is too slow, figuring  out some way to force it into
mmap or do something else smart is an alternative to checking needs
resched. 
I wish that one of the vendors would put together a big test system
to evaluate patches on a range of systems and conditions.
