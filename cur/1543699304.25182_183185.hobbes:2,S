They've certainly been brought up here over and over as an example of
included work that forces the GPL.

So what?  Plugins have a nasty tendency to have to be updated when the
main program is updated.  That doesn't mean that the Netscape license
is allowed to control the flash plugin license.  I think (and very
much hope) that your idea of a derived work is flawed.  Otherwise you
are helping make case law that is going to screw a lot people of over.
If you think Microsoft won't use your expanded definition of what is a
derived work, think again.
