It's all app-specific policy.  mlock(1) allows the sysadmin to apply 
app-specific policy on top of whatever app-specific policy the engineer 
has chosen to hardcode into his app.
A smart sysadmin that knows the working set of his _local configuration_ 
of a given app is sometimes in a better position to make a decision 
about mlockall(2) than the engineer.
