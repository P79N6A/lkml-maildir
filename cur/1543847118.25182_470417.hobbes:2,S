It's as I suspected:
"ieee1394: nodemgr: switch to kthread api, replace reset semaphore"
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=d2f119fe319528da8c76a1107459d6f478cbf28c
Before that, I get a selfID-complete event, then nodemgr starts its
work. After that its the reverse, which lets nodemgr inject a packet
before the bus is completely ready. (So it's actually a regression in
ieee1394 core's high-level functions, not in ohci1394. And it's harmless.)
I will post when I have a fix.
