It would just cause confusion: The name of the function and the name of 
the member must be identical.
The purpose of obj_user_off() is to hide an optimization: 
cachep->user_off is always 0 when debugging is disabled. Therefore the 
member doesn't even exist with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=n, and all accesses are 
hardcoded to 0.
This is achieved by using obj_user_off(cachep) instead of 
cachep->user_off. If the name of the helper and the name of the struct 
member differ, then noone would understand the code.
I'll do a new patch with user_offset instead of user_off, ok?
