That's good to know! :)

As far as I can see, we should be able to use the existing driver once
we adapt the code for the SA1100 features. The charging circuitry is
very similar to the other models as far as I can tell.
MMC/SD is more of a problem. There is one person with the specs who
could write the driver but he can't pass them to anyone else :-(.

You can build such an image with OpenEmbedded easily enough ;-). I guess
you're going to have to run it from the CF card though as the internal
flash isn't big enough and MMC/SD doesn't work?
