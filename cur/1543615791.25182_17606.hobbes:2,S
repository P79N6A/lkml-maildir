<<Or to put it another way: The Linux kernel developers NEED an
implementation defined way to build a pointer from an address.  If
arithmatic on byte pointers isn't it (which is perfectly understandable)
and casting a pointer from an integer isn't it, then can someone please
tell us (not just "that will work for now" or "that will probably work")
how do we do that?

Now that's a very reasonable question. Note that it is not just
kernel developers who need this, anyone doing memory mapped I/O
needs similar capabilities. They are present explicitly in Ada
(with address clauses), but not in C, so you do indeed need to
decide how to provide this capability in a reasonable manner.
