yes. Using only 1 page shared is already overcommitting because in
principle each user can cause a COW on that page and cause a memory
allocation for it in the future. (just like "traditional" overcommit can
cause a pagefault with an allocation)

then I think you're misunderstanding how the linux VM works

but it's a worthwhile gamble to not need GOBBLES of memory you're not
using 99.9999999999999% of the time

swap==ram is not really relevant; you'll need a LOT more to cover the
shared maps...
