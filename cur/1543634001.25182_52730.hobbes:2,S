   Hi, Linus.  This patch switches SCSI from a bottom half to a tasklet.
   It's been reviewed, tested & approved by Andrew Morton, James Bottomley &
   Doug Gilbert.  Please apply.
I always wanted to make this a per-cpu SOFTIRQ, there is no reason
it can't be and it's important enough to deserve to be one.
