"patch-2.6.12-rc6" applies to 2.6.11... not 2.6.11.X.
This is beacuse a new 2.6.11.X version can come out in any time before
2.6.12...
IOW a rule that says: "patch-2.6.X-rcZ applies to linux-2.6.(X-1)" is much
better than "patch-2.6.X-rcZ applies to
linux-2.6.(X-1).LAST_RELEASE_WHEN_THIS_RC_COME_OUT"
becose you don't have to dicover LAST_RELEASE_WHEN_THIS_RC_COME_OUT...
