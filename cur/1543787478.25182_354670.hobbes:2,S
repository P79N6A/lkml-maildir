Oh, it compiles with trivial modifications. Not cleanly, but it works.
I put my git repo on 
	kernel.org:/pub/software/editors/uemacs/uemacs.git
but it will take a moment to mirror out. 
The "readme" says non-commercial only, but I asked Daniel Lawrence if it 
was ok to include it in commercial distributions a long time ago, and he 
said yes. Sadly, I've lost that email, so I don't have any paper trail for 
that. So you should consider the readme binding.

The thing is, it's not a wonderful editor. It's small, and good enough, 
but I really wished somebody wrote something that handled UTF-8, for 
example.  But I've got the keybindings hardcoded in my spine, so I can't 
ever change.
