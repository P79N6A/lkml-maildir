There seems to be a bug in kill ... or it's a documentation bug, I'm not
sure which.
As I undertstand it, 
kill(pid,0) should return 0 only if process #pid exists ... however, it
seems to be returning 0 no matter what ... so one can't use it to test
the existance of a process.  :(
This would be useful when starting a daemon, among other things ... read
the .pid file, and if kill(pid,0) returns an ESRCH, then just delete the
file, since the process is no longer running.
Is my reading wrong?
