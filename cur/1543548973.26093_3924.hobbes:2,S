How about taking a decaying average (loadavg style) of the peak allocation-free 
rate on a minute-by-minute basis.  Then make the number of seconds at that 
rate to use as the inactive_target a tunable parameter.   That way, a user
could, if necessary, tune based on their expected type of load (length of
load bursts), and the alg. would tune to the load level (height of those
bursts).  For a consistent load, peak rate ~= avg. rate, and this decays to
the current behavior, except that the "1 second of allocations" is tunable.
I haven't actually looked at the code, so I don't know how easy/hard this is to
implement, and while it does reintroduce a tuning parameter, it should be needed
less often, and has a much more user-meaningful value (burst length) than # of
free pages to keep handy, which depends on the code, and could change between 
versions.
