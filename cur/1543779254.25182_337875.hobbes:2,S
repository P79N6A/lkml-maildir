Hi Michael.
The content of the .mm file seems to be insignificant - '1'. The important
issue is that the file is present.
Also please do not use $(TOPDIR) - it is deprecated.
The following is enough:
EXTRA_CFLAGS += $(if $(wildcard $(srctree)/.mm), -DMM_KERNEL)
If the file exist in the root of the kernel src tree MM_KERNEL will be
added to EXTRA_CFLAGS.
