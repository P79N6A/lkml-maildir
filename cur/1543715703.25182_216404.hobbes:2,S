Thanks Andi,
I noticed your binary ran with N=2000000 which is only sufficient for a
2 proc 1 MB cache opteron box according to the documentation on the
stream faq.  I also noticed wide variation in results (25% or so) when
running with 4 threads on a 4 proc opteron on linux-2.6.5-mm5.  Can you
provide me with the specs of the system you ran your tests on?
Thanks,
Darren
