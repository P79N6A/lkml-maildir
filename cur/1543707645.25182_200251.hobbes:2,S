Hmm, this is a bit offtopic, Ben, but do you know why my flat panel
using radeonfb spews half a screenful of junk onto the screen when
switching to FB mode at boot time, which later scrolls away?
It's been a problem since as far back as 2.5.59.
My Mobility Radeon is a M6 LY. If you need any other information such as
kernel config and dmesg, sorry, I'm without my laptop right now as I'm
across the country visiting Carnegie Mellon... you'd have to wait until
Saturday. Just wanted to let you know of the issue.
