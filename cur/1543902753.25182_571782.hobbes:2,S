Subject: [PATCH for review] [9/48] i386: move the kernel to 16MB for NUMA-Q
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Andy Whitcroft <apw@shadowen.org>
We are seeing corruption of the decompressed kernel.  It is suspected that
this is platform specific as it has yet to be seen on any other x86.  Move
the kernel to the 16MB boundary.
