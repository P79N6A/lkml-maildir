Usual Linux style is to have this outside of any function scope.
That'll get important once we get a saner tty_unregister_ldisc
prototype.

Please use C99 named initializers.

And no need to initialize anything to 0/NULL.
It should look like:
static struct tty_ldisc n_hdlc_ldisc = {
	.owner		= THIS_MODULE,
	.magic		= TTY_LDISC_MAGIC,
	.name		= "hdlc",
	.open		= n_hdlc_tty_open,
	.close		= n_hdlc_tty_close,
	.read		= n_hdlc_tty_read,
	.write		= n_hdlc_tty_write,
	.ioctl		= n_hdlc_tty_ioctl,
	.poll		= n_hdlc_tty_poll,
	.receive_buf	= n_hdlc_tty_receive,
	.receive_room	= n_hdlc_tty_room,
	.write_wakeup	= n_hdlc_tty_wakeup,
};
