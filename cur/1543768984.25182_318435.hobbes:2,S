Can somebody who know internals of Al Viro's thinking help here?

If It is allowed, the concept of namespaces itself becomes
nebulous.  one could bind mount the root vfsmount of all the other
namespace in their own namespace and then it all becomes one big tree
with all the other namespaces as a subtree.
why would we need this feature? what extra advantage would this feature
provide us? Is the advantage of this feature already discussed in this
thread? (maybe i missed it).

A vfsmount in one namespace bound to a mountpoint in another
