First, please avoid attachments.
Secondly, this makes shm_tot unsigned. Have you checked all places
where it occurs in an inequality to see whether the semantics did
change? (It looks OK.)
Thirdly, shm_tot is transmitted to userspace (via the SHM_INFO ioctl)
as an unsigned long. If it is necessary to make it larger, then we
must do something with this ioctl. For example, return -1 there
in case the actual value does not fit in an unsigned long.
