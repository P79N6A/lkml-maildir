no, it's the call's return address that is work_resched+6.
to get a more usable snapshot of what this task is doing you'd need 
something like SysRq-P output. (that works on PREEMPT_RT only if you 
enable /proc/sys/kernel/debug_direct_keyboard - but careful, it might 
break if you generate too many interrupts - i usually only to do the 
SysRq-P and hope that it doesnt break then.)
