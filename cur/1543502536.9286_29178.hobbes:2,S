Hello,
sorry to bother you with a problem
I used buildkernel utility to download the latest beta version of the
kernel.
At that point of time it downloaded the version 2.3.9
It supposedly ran through the installation but I found that the new kernel
had
not been built.
When I tried to manually build the kernel following the instructions given
in
the README file the error which came was
fs/filesystems.a(fat.o):In function 'fat_file_write':
fat.o(.text+0x264e): undefined reference to 'update_vm_cache'
fs/filesystems.a(ntfs.o):In function 'ntfs_getuser_update_vm':
ntfs.o(.text+0x47): undefined reference to 'update_vm_cache'
Then I saw that that kernel 2.3.10 had been released so I downloaded the
patch
and applied it but even after that I am still getting the same error i.e.
fs/filesystems.a(fat.o):In function 'fat_file_write':
fat.o(.text+0x264e): undefined reference to 'update_vm_cache'
fs/filesystems.a(ntfs.o):In function 'ntfs_getuser_update_vm':
ntfs.o(.text+0x47): undefined reference to 'update_vm_cache'
Actually the patch itself didnot seem to work smoothly also. It repoted that
few of the files were missing but they belonged to the arch/alpha,
arch/sparc64 and arch/sparc so I ignored it.
the output of the ver_kernel is as follows
-- Versions installed: (if some fields are empty or looks
-- unusual then possibly you have very old versions)
