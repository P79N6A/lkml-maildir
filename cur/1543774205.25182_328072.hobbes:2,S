Subject: [PATCH] Add removal schedule of register_serial/unregister_serial to appropriate file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/23/179

I hope there's no need to explain this in the email; if there is, the
entry isn't good enough. 8)
However, wouldn't it be a good idea if this file was ordered by "when" ?
A quick scan of the file reveals a couple of overdue/forgotten items
(maybe they happened but the entry in the file got missed?):
What:   ACPI S4bios support
When:   May 2005
What:   register_ioctl32_conversion() / unregister_ioctl32_conversion()
When:   April 2005

 	more efficient.  You should really be using libraw1394 for raw1394

+What:	register_serial/unregister_serial
+When:	December 2005
+Why:	This interface does not allow serial ports to be registered against
+	a struct device, and as such does not allow correct power management
+	of such ports.  8250-based ports should use serial8250_register_port
+	and serial8250_unregister_port instead.
