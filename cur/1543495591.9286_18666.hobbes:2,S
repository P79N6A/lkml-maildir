Shame, so you've just broken notebooks.

Ok, but it gives sense not to spin up even if there are few dirty
buffers. (Remember that nearly anything touches atimes of files which
means dirty buffers!)

It may be unsafe, but I'll rather be unsafe and sleep at night.

We exactly know when  disks  are spun down -- becuase it is bdflush
which spins them down. So it knows  it spun  them down and it can
detect spin up by increased numbers in /proc/stat.

My version of bdflush parses /proc/stat, field disk_rio. It is not
completely safe but it works well enough.

PS: Did that patch go into 2.2.8? I'm afraid it did :-(.
