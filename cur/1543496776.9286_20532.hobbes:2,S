Trond,
I took your advice and did some more debugging, the summary is that the
problem goes away with rsize and wsize set to 1024, but either 4096 or
8192 gives the infinite loop on the troublesome directory.  Mounting the
identical export to a 2.0.36/lib5 machine with any r/wsize works fine. 
Please take a look at the output below and tell me where to look next
(assuming you think this is worth tracking down).  Seems to only happen on
a directory with particular entries, thus it is hard to generate on
demand, other setups here at the U have also seen the same problem.  But I
have a repeatable setup on machines I can play with at home. 
Here is the client setup (should have given this originally):

With default mount (4096 rsize, wsize):  when I do a readdir() loop on the 
troublesome directory, a tcpdump gives (soling is the server, y2 the client) 
 Unknown/1 "basic" (ttl 64, id 33631)

so tcpdump sees the eof as I understand this.
in nfs2xdr.c have:
		status = !p[0] && p[1] ? (1 << 15) : 0; /* eof flag */
		*entry++ = fileid;
		*entry++ = cookie;
		*entry++ = ((string - start) << 16) | status | (len & 0x7FFF);
		
		if(status)
		{
			dfprintk(VFS, "NFS: 2 p[0] = %u p[1] = %u \n",p[0],p[1]);
			dfprintk(VFS, "NFS: got EOF bit \n"); 
		}
		else
		{
			dfprintk(VFS, "NFS: 2 p[0] = %u p[1] = %u \n",p[0],p[1]); 
		}
	}
and this gives:
May 25 19:56:34 y2 kernel: NFS: 2 p[0] = 16777216 p[1] = 473432178 
May 25 19:56:34 y2 kernel: NFS: 2 p[0] = 16777216 p[1] = 540541042

May 25 19:56:34 y2 kernel: TWS: EOF bit NOT set  
the last line is from my check in dir.c as per my original (wrong) patch 
(which is disabled, I just left the dfprintk's in) and then the code goes 
into the infinite loop of looking in the cache, not finding the eof...
run the same thing with 1024 rsize and wsize:

May 25 20:01:55 y2 kernel: TWS: EOF bit set 
note that mounting with rsize and wsize different from 1024 to a 2.0.36,
lib5 (RH4.2+) box works fine.  Mounting with 4096 or 8192 does 
not work on the 2.2.9 box (the directory takes only one packet in each 
case).
I can export a directory that results in a p[0]=0 p[1]=0 on the last
entry, but in that case nfs_readdir() gets called again, does another
nfs_proc_readdir() which returns a value of zero, which causes an exit to
done and all is well.  I don't understand why the p[0]=0 p[1]=0 causes the
additional rpc read in one case (which is needed to find the eof) and not 
the other (where the eof appears to have already been sent).
Any thoughts or suggestions on which way to go next?
thanks,
