I posted a message a few days ago with a question I had about writing
a device driver, and you helped a lot. So here I am again with a new
problem.
The compilation of my driver is ok, but when it is going to be linked
with the kernel, the linker is not able to resolve __outb and __outbc.
Do I have to link any special library?
Thanks in advance.
