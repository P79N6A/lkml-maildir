 The same with certain MIPS configurations.  And likewise you need to xor 
addresses with 2 for halfword accesses.

 To clarify it a bit: both big and little endian representations are 
always the same -- it's going to a domain of the reverse endianness that 
can be done in two different ways, i.e. by preserving either bit or byte 
ordering (as described above).  Depending on the interpretation of data 
being passed you want one or the other.  That's why some systems provide 
ways of doing both kinds of accesses in hardware (e.g. the host bus to PCI 
bridge) to save CPU cycles needed for bit shuffling otherwise.
