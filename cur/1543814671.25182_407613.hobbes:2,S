We are probably digressing from the original discussion but just wanted to
point out that the situations presented to clone and unshare are a bit 
different.
Clone returns an error because in the same call you are trying to provide
illegal combination of flags. Like saying that you want a new namespace
but want to share the filesystem. There is no way for clone to know which
of the two flags to honor or ignore. Where as with unshare if you are
trying to unshare namespace but are currently sharing filesystem, then
it is possible to complete the request by unsharing filesystem as well .
You may remember that the earlier incarnation of the unshare patch did
return an error. However it was pointed out, and correctly so, that it is
better to unshare appropriate related contexts.
