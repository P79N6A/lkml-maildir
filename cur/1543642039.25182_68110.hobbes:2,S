Subject: [PATCH] redundant stddef.h in wait.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

In 2.5.32, include/linux/wait.h includes both kernel.h and stddef.h, but
kernel.h already includes stddef.h.  So, should we just delete the
redundant include of stddef.h?  There are others.  If this is OK, I will
sent it and it's kin to trivial.
Patch below for perusal and comments
