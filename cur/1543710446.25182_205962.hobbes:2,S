Different design.  How about this:
- Files with just one link remain as-is.
- Linking a file:
  - Create a new inode and move all data into new inode.
  - Make old inode a pointer to new inode.
  - Create a second pointer to new inode.
- Unlinking a file:
  - Unlink pointer inode
  - Unlink target inode
- Writing to a pointer inode:
  - Make pointer inode a regular one.
  - Copy target inode data into former pointer inode.
  - Unlink target inode
  - If target count was 1, we don't even need to copy.
Or in ascii art:
Regular file:
	inode 1
Second link:
	inode 1 ---> inode 2
	             ^
	inode 3 -----|
Write to inode 1:
	inode 1
	inode 3 ---> inode 2
Unlink of inode 3:
	inode 1
Not quite as simple and straightforward as my first design, but it has
some advantages.  Would even be possible to extend it and allow links
across different filesystems.
