Al Viro, 
I got to the bottom of the problems reported by Steve Hirsch relative to
building Linux from an NWFS root volume.  I am not doing an explicit
iget() on the new inode and the Linux VFS is corrupting kernel memory
when it gets back the renamed inode.  
I have a question here.  In rename() is it always assumed that the
target must do a read_inode() via iget() after the file is mv'd?   What
about the case where you are simply renaming a file in the same
directory?  Is it always the case that rename will remove the old inode
and substitute the new one even if you are just renaming a file in the
same directory?  This is the case causing all the problems.
A description of just how rename() is **SUPPOSED** to work would help. 
The Linux rename() semantics are somewhat confusing -- last bug and NWFS
will run as a root filesystem in Linux and we can ship our Linux
Distribution.  I fixed the bamp() bugs reported at the same time, so the
page cache is now working and apps run ok.  Runs very fast too....
Please advise.
Jeff
