You can have multiple branches in one git repository.  E.g. git's own
repository has a "master" branch containing all committed changes, a
"next" branch which is similar to a release candidate and is regularly
merged back into "master" if ready, and a "pu" branch which contains the
more experimental stuff.  The latter doesn't even have a continuous history.
And it has other branches containing different stuff, e.g. "man" is a
special branch containing the generated manpages.  You could also have
topic branches or one branch per submitter, or whatever.

There's even a quilt clone based on git (
http://www.procode.org/stgit/
).
 I have never used it, though, so I can't comment on it.
That said, it's a good idea to keep the master branch continuous, i.e.
never delete it or reset it to some previous commit.  So, as you
suggest, have a staging area for patches and only commit the good ones
to your master branch.  You can use a branch in the same repo as staging
area, though.
You can do quite a lot of different things with just one git repository.
