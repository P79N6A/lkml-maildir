Thanks for the git guide links.
I spent some time reading them yesterday (not the Ubuntu
one you pointed to, but others.)
After repeated efforts, beginning with the birth of git,
it is clear that I have some sort of congenital mental
defect that makes me unsuited for using git.
Hopefully someone benefited from your links.
