Hi all,
    I am programming a device driver on PLX9060 chipset, and want to config DMA controller by IO memory,
but I find that can't access them in regular way,below are my codes.
>cat /proc/pci
Bus  0, device  16, function  0:
    Bridge: PLX Unknown device (rev 3).
      Vendor id=10b5. Device id=9060.
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 12.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=8.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7100000 [0xe7100000].
      I/O at 0xe400 [0xe401].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7000000 [0xe7000000].
I want to access the virtual address of 0xe7000000 by ioremap()
struct dev {
    u32 mem;
    u32 io;
    u32 space0;
    ...
};
 mem = 0xe7100000;
 io = 0xe400;
 space0 = 0xe7000000;
ulong * remap = (ulong *)ioremap_nocache(space0, 0x200);  
remap =remap + (0x100>>2);  /* access DMA register by offset 0x100 bytes */
/* check the return value of ioremap by printk()
 * remap = 0xc2059100;
 */
 /*
  * Now test to see if I can access the DMA registers
  * If I write -1 and get back 1FFF, then we accessed the
  * DMA register, isn't it?  
  * there are two methods: remap[0x00] =x, writel(x, remap + 0x00), but I don't know their difference.
  */
remap[0x00] = 0xFFFFFFFF;
/* check the return value of remap by printk()
 * remap[0x00] = 0xffffffff;
 * remap[0x01] = 0xffffffff;
 * remap[0x02] = 0xffffffff;
 * remap[0x03] = 0xffffffff;
 * remap[0x04] = 0xffffffff;
 * remap[0x05] = 0xffffffff;
 */
then rerun the module
writel(0xffffffff, remap + 0x00);
/* check the return value of remap by readl()
 * remap + 0x00 = 0xffffffff;
 * remap + 0x01 = 0xffffffff;
 * remap + 0x02 = 0xffffffff;
 * remap + 0x03 = 0xffffffff;
 * remap + 0x04 = 0xffffffff;
 * remap + 0x05 = 0xffffffff;
 * remap + 0x06 = 0xffffffff;
 */
so, I think probably access error,
I don't know how to update my code to access DMA registers.
any helps are appreciated.
thanks in advance.
