I illustrated what looked like to be his reason and it was valid here too,
and you even removed the proofs on purpose of not commenting.

Oh yes, of course... Any advice to make mail communication better for
everyone on a mailing list surely is trolling and trying to bring anything
into a flame war... I am always amused by the contents of your rants.
I've never known if you sometimes believe what you say, but it's not my
problem anyway. Maybe having the last word by boring people make you feel
like you're right. But if you cannot openly communicate with people on
mailing lists, please first do not open discussions on subjects which
are known to derivate into flame wars. This month has been particularly
loaded with non-productive contents already.
