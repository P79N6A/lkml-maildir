I did see it be mentioned in a few.  But it really isn't that big of a
problem, as all distros seemed to have their /dev/i2c* nodes set to:
	$ ls -l /dev/i2c*
	crw-------  1 root root 89, 0 Feb 23 13:02 /dev/i2c0
	crw-------  1 root root 89, 0 Feb 23 13:02 /dev/i2c-0
	crw-------  1 root root 89, 1 Feb 23 13:02 /dev/i2c1
	crw-------  1 root root 89, 1 Feb 23 13:02 /dev/i2c-1
Which prevents any normal user from exploiting this issue.
thanks,
