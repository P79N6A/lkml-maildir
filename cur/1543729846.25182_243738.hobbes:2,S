The main difference between Sun and Linux as I see here in these discussions
is, that Sun remembers who does make a bug report (unfortunately this does not
apply to the local bug report centers but to the Sun central).
For this reason, it is easy for me to get attention. The right people at Sun 
just know that I did make a lot if important bug reports and take me serious.
When I send a bug report about incorrect signal handling in all known ssh 
clients out in Saturday noon, I did get a reply from Sun Saturday evening
and a reply from OpenSSH on Monday. I did never get a reply from SSH.com
although they did fix the bug too.
What I did send out a bug report against Solaris 10 USB-2 DMA problems, I did
receive a new test driver binary from the team leader 10 days later.
If you are unknown at Sun, you may habe problems......
