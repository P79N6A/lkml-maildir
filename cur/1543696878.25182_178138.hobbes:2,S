All this rebooting into kernels that DO or DON'T remap would have been
unneccesary if the remapping would not have cloned block 1 to appear
in block 0, but would just have swapped them. 
In remapped mode, you now read block 1 wether you seek to block 0 or 1. 
If the remapping would have swapped them, just copying over the block
from block 1 to block 0 would have allowed the removal of the stupid
remapping. 
ide.c:1381
        /* Yecch - this will shift the entire interval,
           possibly killing some innocent following sector */
        if (block == 0 && drive->remap_0_to_1 == 1)
             block = 1;  /* redirect MBR access to EZ-Drive partn table */
should have been:
	if ((block <= 1)  && drive->remap_0_to_1) 
		block ^= 1;
(IMHO, it's not worth going in and fixing this for say 2.4 or 2.6
kernels(*), but it IS worth noting and not making the same mistake again in
the future.....)

(*) For example because that would change established behaviour which is
bad and can lead to surprises. If we'd change it, Andries' "how to fix"
emails would become even longer: He'd have to start: IF you have a
modern kernel, you can just ... but otherwise you'll have to .... and
then comes the whole mess I didn't fully quote.....
