no, at least I don't find it, when I type env.

I tried make all modules_install install V=1 &>/tmp/kernel2.log and found 
something interessting.
The kernel-sources directory has to be 'virgin'. As soon as I build a kernel 
in it once, it worked without any problems - even after a make clean and make 
mrproper.
So the steps to reproduce it are:
unpack 2.6.15, patch it, copy .config from other kernel (this time I took the 
one from git8 I built earlier), make oldconfig, make all_modules_install 
install:
f [ -r System.map -a -x /sbin/depmod ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  
2.
6.15-git7; fi

because kernel2.log is 748kb big., I packed it.
Glück Auf
