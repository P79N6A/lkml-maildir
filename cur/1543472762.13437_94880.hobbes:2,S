But it's always only binary zeros, regardless if it is 8-bit, 16-bit or
whatever. That's diffrent with one: A set of 8-bit ones is diffrent from
16-bit ones - and we need neither 8-bit nor 16-bit ones. In fact we need
8-bit 255, 16-bit 65535, and so on (i.e. only binary ones). The name
/dev/one could suggest that it is an integer one - but it isn't - it's a
number with all bits set to 1 - and that's much higher that integer 1.
If you wan't to delete all data on a disk or partition, just use
'badblocks -w' It writes 11111111, 01010101, 10101010 and 00000000
to the block device (as far as i remember).
