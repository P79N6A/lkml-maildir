Yes.

Not really, this is pointing out an alternative means of secure
deletion _if_ you have encryption.  The points I wanted to make were,
most important first:
   - Overwriting data does not always do what you think it does.
     Several block devices _do not_ overwrite the same storage blocks.
     Thus it is dangerous to call something "secure deletion"
     when it might not do anything at all.
   - Filesystems on top of encrypted block devices _do_ need
     overwriting-based secure deletion, if they are of the type where
     the block encryption key is derived from the block offset and device
     key only.
   - Eraseable per-file keys may be a more secure way of destroying
     data than overwriting data on a magnetic medium.
