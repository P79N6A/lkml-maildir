What does e2fsck's "non-contiguous" really say? I always thought it may 
give a clue about how a filesystem is fragmented.
However, I had set up a filesystem on a 365 GB RAID-5 array:
/dev/sdao             365G  195M  347G   1% /mnt/1
The filesystem contains only one directory (lost+found).
I ran e2fsck on that filesystem, and it says "9.1% non-contiguous":
# e2fsck -f part
e2fsck 1.39 (29-May-2006)

"9.1% non-contiguous" - what meaning does it really have?
