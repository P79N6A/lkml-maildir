Nothing in your patch series uses this, and it's identical to
stringify().   Please remove?

Shouldn't this be added to include/linux/rbtree.h?

I'm not sure this should be polluting the kernel symbol namespace,
especially since the implementation calls ubi_assert()....
It's not clear the assertion is all that useful, but if you must have
it, why not do the check as an inline (with the assertion normally
turned off), and then call out to kmemdup()?
