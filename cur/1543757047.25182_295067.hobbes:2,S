How would the `bk changes -v ' output look like for such a merge of 20
changesets on a branch?  Would it list the 20 merged changesets?
Also, would the changeset ids (ChangeSet@1.2044) match the revision
IDs in the CVS tree?
If so, it looks like this would provide the very bit of information
that I feel to be missing from the publicly-available Linux
repository.

Any chance of having such tarballs offered from an rsync server,
compressed with gzip --rsyncable?
