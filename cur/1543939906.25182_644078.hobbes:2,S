Subject: [PATCH] firewire: fail open() quickly if the node doesn't exist anymore
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/27/156

Scenario:  Process A keeps the character device file of node N open.
N is being unplugged.  File /dev/fwN won't be destroyed as long as A
doesn't close it.  Now, process B opens /dev/fwN as well.  Previously
it would succeed but be unable to do any IO on it of course.  With this
patch, process B's open() will fail immediately with -ENODEV.
