It may make sense to have an explicit taint flag which means direct
access to memory, via /dev/mem or otherwise, with exceptions for I/O
mapped memory not claimed by a device driver (and of course X until it
is fixed, or never, whichever comes first).
As I've mentioned, the original reason why I did this was because I
needed to mmap physical memory, which at the time when I originally
did things, /dev/mem didn't support except for the I/O mapped memory
range, and I assumed that any attempt to enhance /dev/mem's mmap()
capabilities in a patch intended for mainline wouldn't be looked at as
a friendly act.  In fact, I was so unhappy about being forced by the
RTSJ specification to do this insane thing that I wanted to make sure
that if it were ever used, it would set a TAINT flag to warn people
that just about anything unsane could have happened, and the system's
stability was at the mercy of the competence of Java application
programmers.  :-)
