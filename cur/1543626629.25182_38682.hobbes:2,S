Around 20 seconds or less from when the kernel starts init(8) to when
my XDM splash screen is up, last time I checked.

The problem is that you're not listing the metadata blocks when
building the database, right? And that's because Linus didn't want
such hackery in the kernel. So instead we got the not-very-useful
readahead system call.

Of course, my boot scripts do the dependency stuff right (actually,
it's the changes I made to simpleinit(8) that make it possible).

Or being able to preload *everything* in ascending order...
