My Motorola Powerstack II Pro4000 (a PReP machine from Motorola) does 
not boot in current -git. It worked fine in -rc5 except iptables (not 
tacked down the breaking commit yet, sorry) but does not boot in current 
-git (neither did it with a 2 days old checkout).
The symptoms are that the boot command line is corrupted (parts of 
prompt or previous output are written to command line and the command 
line becomes broken (like invalid root device).
