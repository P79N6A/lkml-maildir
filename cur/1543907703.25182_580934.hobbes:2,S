That's fair. Again, suggestions are welcome. Maybe SYSCALL_RETURN ?

yes, this one is wrong. Thanks for the catch

I don't think so. They are live here, but restore_args follows, so we
can safely clobber anything here. Right?

Just went on the flow. Will change.

That's exactly what I had in mind. I'd highly prefer to keep it this
way until it is merged, and we are sure all the rest is stable
