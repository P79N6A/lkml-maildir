Version 2 had about 250 new lines of code, while v3 has close to 600, when
including the SROG code. And that while things should have become simpler.
So why use SROG instead of the old alloc_pages() based code? And why couldn't
you use a slightly modified SLOB instead of writing a new allocator?
It looks like overkill to me.
