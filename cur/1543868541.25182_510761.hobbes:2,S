That's true. I'll make the change for git if Dave has no objections.
It happened because in the SGI tree we want it global for use in kdb by xfsidbg.o,
and that used to happen in the CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG case where STATIC would define
to nothing - looks like it is global always in our tree now since Dave's patch.
i.e. it was actually becoming global previously via STATIC on CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG
but one wouldn't have noticed that :) AFAICT.
Hmmm, I'll talk to Dave about this.
