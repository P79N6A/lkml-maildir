Subject: What's up with the GIT archive on www.kernel.org?

Since about 20 hours ago, it seems the
linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git/ archive on www.kernel.org
alternates between at least two different HEAD commits. First it was
        40 hours ago [PATCH] md: fix BUG when raid10 rebuilds without
        enough drives
then it changed to 
        15 hours ago Merge
        master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6
then it changed back to the raid10 commit. It looks like it has
flipped back and forth quite a few times. Currently it seems to happen
once every couple of minutes or so.
This affects both gitweb and rsync, but the rsync flipping is not
synchronized with the gitweb flipping.
Does anyone else see this? "host www.kernel.org" gives me two IP
addresses:
        www.kernel.org is an alias for zeus-pub.kernel.org.
        zeus-pub.kernel.org has address 204.152.191.5
        zeus-pub.kernel.org has address 204.152.191.37
Is it possible that one of those computers hasn't received the latest
changes for some reason?
