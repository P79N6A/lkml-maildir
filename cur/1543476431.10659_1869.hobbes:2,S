strace works funny for me on 2.2.0-pre6.  (Not sure when it started
doing this; probably sometime back in 2.1.x, since I don't use it 
very often.)
I get these kernel messages:
Jan  9 19:09:40 kgb kernel: Process: ftp (stack=c663fe5c, task=c663e000)
Jan  9 19:09:40 kgb kernel: [<c016698b>] [<c0166d56>] [<c0117645>] [<c016d707>] [<c0174a0b>] [<c017497c>] [<c0156f2e>] [<c017497c>] [<c0157145>] [<c01570ac>] [<c0123b38>] [<c0109634>] 
Jan  9 19:09:40 kgb kernel: Process: ftp (stack=c663fef0, task=c663e000)
Jan  9 19:09:40 kgb kernel: [<c010938f>] [<c0157145>] [<c01570ac>] [<c0123b38>] [<c0123b50>] [<c010967c>] 
Jan  9 19:09:40 kgb kernel: Process: ftp (stack=c663ff8c, task=c663e000)
Jan  9 19:09:40 kgb kernel: [<c010c789>] [<c010969d>] 
... these last two lines continue for a long time (evidently until I 
hit ^C on the strace).  I don't see an actual error message here,
but I guess this is a stack dump of some sort.
I don't know how this stuff works under the covers, but I shouldn't be
able to make the kernel go crazy like this.  If this is not a known 
problem then I'll try to look into why my machine doing this...  or is 
this just a case of debug messages that were never turned off?
strace(1)'s output (when redirected to a file so it's not cluttered with
the kernel messages) seems okay.
