Well, "git apply" takes flags like "-C1" to accept fuzzy patches, and 
--whitespace=fix etc to apply them despite whitespace differences etc. 
And at least more modern versions of "git am" should take them and pass 
them on. Although I'd generally not encourage that much. Partly because I 
hate how often it has screwed up over the years thanks to GNU patch 
accepting any random crud.
So out of that, if I personally have a patch that only applies with fuzz 
and I know I still want to apply it, I just go and manually edit away the 
parts that no longer match in the patch itself (and fix up the line 
counts etc). But that's obviously me, and I'm very comfy editing patches 
directly.
But another quite useful approach is to just try to apply the patch to the 
version that it was done against - preferably in a separate branch - and 
then just merging the end result.

Yeah, I know, "git am" really is very strict, and sometimes annoyingly so. 
But it _can_ be overridden. And if the other end uses git to generate the 
patch, you can also do a three-way apply, which really tends to work. But 
that requires that the patch have the SHA1 ID's of the original blobs (and 
that you have those blobs - ie that the patch was really generated against 
something you already had)
