Subject: Where did find_bus() go in 2.6.18?

Hello linux-kernel,
  We here at Handhelds.org upgrading our drivers to 2.6.18 and I just
caught a case of find_bus() being undefined during link. Quickly
traced this to
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=7e4ef085ea4b00cfc34e854edf448c729de8a0a5
  But alas, the commit message is not as good as some others are, and
doesn't mention what should be used instead. So, if find_bus() is
"unused", what should be used instead?
Thank you,
