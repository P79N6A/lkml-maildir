I think it _is_ unreasonable. It's like doing
	if (a)
		x /= a;
and the compiler complaining that "a" can be zero. The above is perfectly
reasonable code and may well have a constant zero as part of inlining or
macro expansion. A compiler that does that is being silly. It's being
_especially_ silly since it evaluates to
	if (0)
		..
at compile time in this case. Yeah, yeah, sparse gets it wrong too, but 
only if the left-hand side is zero as well.
But yes, at least the compiler isn't totally buggy if it's just a warning. 
After all, you can warn about anything you like ;)
Anyway, to make it not warn, why not change it to
	max_threads = mempages / (8*THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE);
instead, and be done with it? If the thread size is _that_ small that we 
still divide by zero, color me impressed.
