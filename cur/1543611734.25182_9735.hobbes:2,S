Your sh process appears to be hung in wait_for_devfsd_finished(). It
would be helpful to know what devfsd was doing at this time. If it
were hung internally (in user-space), it would account for this
behaviour. However, if devfsd crashes, then devfsd_close() will be
called, which will wake any waiters.

cron		->	pipe_wait()

Maybe these are just waiting on mutt(1)?

That's what I like to hear. Set CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG=y and boot with
"devfs=dall" and send me the (verbose) kernel logs. That should show
the sequence of events that lead to this.

Just "Richard" is fine. I'm not a fan of formality.
