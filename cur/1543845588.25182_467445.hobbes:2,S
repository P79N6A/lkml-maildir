And this is an area where I slightly disagree with you.  While I would
hope that you were right, I can easily imagine a judge ruling that "v2
or later" in the preamble means that the project just signed a blank
license of the FSF's discretion.
I can just as easily imagine a judge ruling that "simply copying the
GPL license verbatim and not removing the 'or later'" clause is does
not sufficiently demonstrate the authors intent to dual-license the
code.
And the likelihood of either ruling will depend on many things, but
will never reach 0 or 1.  It is a gray area where your legal advice is
just as bad as mine and your "GPLv2 only" clarification may in fact be
a fork I was talking about.  We just don't know until this has been
tested in court, which hopefully never happens.
