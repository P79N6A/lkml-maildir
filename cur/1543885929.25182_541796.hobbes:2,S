x86_64 UP Athlon64 I get a crash on boot using SLUB.  Switching to SLAB 
makes it go away.  I don't have a serial console, so the best I have is 
a digital photo of as many lines as my VGA console was able to get (60 
or so).  Is there a better way to capture the oops output so that the 
full trace canbe seen?

config and dmesg from working SLAB configuration (broken when switched 
to SLUB):
