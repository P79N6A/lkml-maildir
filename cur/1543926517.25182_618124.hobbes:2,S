I can reproduce the bug in a second. I will test any version you send 
me. I take it you have tested the driver on gigabit ethernet by sending 
zero from one netcat to another (the sending machine being something, 
and the receiving machine being skge)?
The only thing that needed to be done for the last 6 patches in the
mainline was reversing the order of two register writes, meaning that 
the dual port stuff need not be thrown away. This was explained in my 
bug report (that was hard to read). I'm not suggesting this is a proper 
fix. In fact, I think it's not, because we can not explain the problem.
It would _very_ nice to get to the bottom of this issue, so I would 
favor reverting the patch and trying and debugging carefully before 
creating quick and dirty fixes..
Thank you all..
