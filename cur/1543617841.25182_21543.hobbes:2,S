It is (was) an ISA nic and the fun part is, that it had been working for
me under minix & linux (under different hardware configuration though).

The bad part was, that I didnt do lsmod then. After reboot the card was
rendered completely useless (except for a few probably functional diodes
on the pc-board :-).

It was a jumperless ne2000 isa clone. The io adress was right alright, but
i just left irq unspecified. And that fact drove me to bore the people on
this list ...
My question is that how can the module detect false parameters and how is
it possible to make it protect the hardware in such case? 
The module ne.o most probably managed to write some garbage to the nics
flash address somehow and that makes me worry a bit.
