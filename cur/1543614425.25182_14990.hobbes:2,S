ReiserFS is not labelled experimental in the SuSE kernel nowadays...... 
  and I think SuSE is correct.  We still have bugs, you can read about 
them on our mailing list, but hitting them is much less likely than a 
drive failure for ReiserFS users on the whole.  2.4.17 looks like our 
most stable version yet.  Marcello does a really nice job of quickly 
integrating patches.
