This discussion shouldnt have started in this list at all, no matter how
short. I want to read about a bunch of people way smarter then me fixing
things and in that way helping me to learn how to fix my things, and
hopefully enable me in the future to help others fix things. Not some
dispute about a name. Lets just stop this, and concentrate on the system we
like so much.
