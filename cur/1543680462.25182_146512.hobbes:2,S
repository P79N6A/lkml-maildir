He never said the NDA forced him to _do_ something _illegal_.
Instead it forces him to _not do_ something _legal_.
I once had a job where I wasn't to drive the company vehicle faster than 
45 MPH. Even if the speed limit is 55 MPH, I could have been fired for 
driving that fast.
Similar situation for Andre. Legaly he can distrubite the code in 
question, but he would loose future work because of it. Nobody would 
trust him, regardless of his reasons. He (would have) violated the NDA.
