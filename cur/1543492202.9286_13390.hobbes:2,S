Hi,
I have a strange problem : 
I have a Jazdrive (1GB) connected to an Adaptec AVA-1505 SCSI card. I'm
using the aha152x driver with these options in my lilo.conf :
append="aha152x=0x340,10,7,1" (if I omit this, the scsi-card is not
recognized)
On one Jazdisk, I have a collection of .mp3 (music) files. When playing
them using x11amp under the 2.0.x kernels, there was no problem. But as
of the 2.2.x kernels, the sound "shocks" from time to time. When a "shock"
occurs, the jazdrive is always reading the jazdisk, but the shocking does
not always occur when the disk is being read.
I already : tried other mp3-playback software, tried another jazdisk,
checked for some sort of IRQ problems, tried other mp3-playback settings,
tried different 2.2.x kernels, tried different parameters in the lilo.conf,
but all with no effect.
So it seems to me the problem is in the aha152x part of the 2.2.x kernels ?
Can somebody please help me out here, this problem is very annoying. Maybe
I should check some kernel parameters or something ?
Many thanks in advance !
Jasper
