Darn, now you make me think ;-)
Ok, I think I have it; the crux of the matter is that we want
reader-in-writer recursion for the cpu hotplug lock.
So we want:
 cpu_hotplug.write_lock()
   A.lock()
     cpu_hotplug.read_lock()
When - as it was - the write lock is implemented as keeping the lock
internal lock (the lock guarding the lock state) locked over the entire
write section, and the read lock side is, LOCK; change state; UNLOCK,
the above will result in a deadlock like:
  C.lock
    A.lock
      C.lock
By making both the read and write side work like:
 LOCK
  change state
 UNLOCK
the internal lock will not deadlock.
So what I did was promote cpu_hotplug to a full lock that handled
read-in-read and read-in-write recursion and made cpu_hotplug.lock the
lock internal lock.

I don't think we do. It just didn't occur to me to pile read-waiters and
write-waiters on the same waitqueue.
