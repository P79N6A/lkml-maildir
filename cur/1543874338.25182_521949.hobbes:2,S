There is a seperate mailing list for scsi releated issues, e.g.
linux-scsi@.   I've posted a patch to address your issue several times,
however it seems its not been picked up by the scsi subsystem
maintainer.   The last time it was posted was here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=117089244809072&w=2
   An alternative is
you could obtain our latest drivers from the LSI download site, where
these drivers should have this patch
