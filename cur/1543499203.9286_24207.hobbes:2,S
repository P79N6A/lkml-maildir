Well, usually you mount all your harddisks on bootup, and I don't care if
the system seeks a few partitions every five years. :-)
No, seriously: Most, if not all, mounts you do while the system is running
are referencing devices anyway (/dev/fd0, /dev/cdrom, ...). Those few that
remain usually happen shortly after another, and most likely at bootup,
where much physical memory is still available.
So why not read in that information once at bootup, act upon it and throw
it away after some time or when a program tells us to?
