I looked over the 3com web site for modems, and _all_ PCI modems there
appear to be Winmodems (they require Windows for operation, not just for
running the programs on the CDs as explicitly stated in the specs; as
opposed to the equivalent ISA models). OTOH, the Red Hat site states that
PCI modems based on the Lucent Venus chipset can be made to work.
Good luck!
