Hi
I was looking for information about this in the lkml archives and lots
of books and howtos but I did not find the definitive answer to my
questions.
Please excuse if I missed something.
I want to do TCP/IP in the Kernel.
I already have an implementation running in the 2.2.14 Kernel and it
looks
quite good. But I wanted to make sure that I did not miss something
important because the application I am working on must be very stable
and
reliable.
I assume that the normal way would be something like this (2.2 kernel):
{ 
	mm_segment_t old_fs; 
	lock_kernel(); 
	old_fs = get_fs(); 
	set_fs(KERNEL_DS); /* Needed for the copy_from_user 
			      that tcp_do_sendmsg is going to do */
	err = sock_sendmsg(sock, msg, size);
	set_fs(old_fs); 
	unlock_kernel();
}
Is this correct ?
More questions:
-) What is the best way to get rid of the copy_from_user memcpy that
tcp_do_sendmsg does in that call?
-) How do I have to adapt this code to work in the 2.4 Kernel
(especially because the lock_kernel should hopefully no longer be needed
in 2.4) 
What is the proper way to make that thing SMP-Safe in 2.4?
Thanks for your answers
