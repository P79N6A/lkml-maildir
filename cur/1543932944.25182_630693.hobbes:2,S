That I understand. So you need a CONFIG_ option to switch off
-regparm=3 and pray that the kernel assembly supports it.
And then I assume you avoided kbuild because it added -regparm=3
which is why your simple module broke.
As you are well aware there is not any testing of a kernel without
-regparm=3 these days so you should strongly consider making your
assembly module comply with -regparm=3.
And no - I dunno how much work that is and what impact it has
on your number chrunching stuff.
But it looks like the only sane long-term solution to me.
