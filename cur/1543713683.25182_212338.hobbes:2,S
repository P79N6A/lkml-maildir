That's not quite my point.  I am not afraid of running my athlons at
70C.  I just don't want to.  With Debian Woody they ran at <40C, which
is impressing IMHO.  An upgrade to Sarge raised the temp for about 5K,
which is still very cool.  This temperature didn't change when I
upgraded to an early 2.6 kernel.  Just after 2.6.3-mm4 there was this
jump for 10K that I just do not understand.  It doesn't hurt the athlons
but seems unnecessary to me.
