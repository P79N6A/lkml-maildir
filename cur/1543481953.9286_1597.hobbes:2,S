	Today I spent a few hours browing RAMBUS pages and presentations
	about this issue.    Reading the thing about interleaved pipelined
	memory subsystems brought me some memories from elsewere, and
	true enough, DEC 7000 and 10000 systems had similarly behaving
	large-scale bus in them.  (They were introduced in 1992, which
	means the designs and patents are at least couple years older..)
	Similar designs can be found from CRAY supercomputers too, I think.
	The idea is that to access some memory item one sends the requests
	out, and waits the given response time -- 80 ns or so, however
	there can be multiple outstanding requests issued to the memory
	subsystem as each requests occupies only 20 nanoseconds.
