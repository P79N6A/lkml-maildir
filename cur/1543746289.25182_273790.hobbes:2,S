i tried your new test-client, and i've got a generic question: should a
jack client be able to generate an xrun via, other than via overloading
jackd? E.g. i'm wondering about the following behavior: if start up
jackd in the usual way:
  jackd -R -P20 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p64 -n2 -S -P
and then i start a single test-client (jack_test.cpp):
 # ./jack_test
 seconds to run: 60
 client_new: jack_test-4215
 port_register
 set_process_callback
 activate
 running
and then if i now Ctrl-Z the Jack client, i get an immediate xrun
message from jackd:
  **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 2.119 msecs
and when i 'fg' the client again then jackd sees a big delay:
  **** alsa_pcm: xrun of at least 742.064 msecs
corresponding the amount of time i waited between the Ctrl-Z and the 
'fg'.
since the client runs as SCHED_OTHER, doesnt this mean that simple
delays between SCHED_OTHER tasks could cause xruns in jackd too? A
SCHED_OTHER task can be delayed indefinitely at any stage. So shouldnt
the test-clients have RT priority as well, to guarantee xrun-less jackd?
