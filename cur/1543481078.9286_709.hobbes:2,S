I have a similar problem, except that the computer oops's right after it
detects the LS120
and says something about not being able to handle a null pointer..
I think it has something to do with how the kernel detects the available
disk space on the LS120. 
The kernel used to just gripe about the ls120 returning 2 different disk
capacitys.
 both pre 7 and 8 don't work with it but it DOES work fine with pre
7-ac4. 
sorry about the extreme vagueness of this, but I put the ls120 in
another computer after it failed in pre8 4 or 5 days ago and haven't
thought about it since.
