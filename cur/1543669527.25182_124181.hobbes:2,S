We've had a "problem" with 3.2. Some conditional new code looked like
this:
#define LONG_MACRO \
	asm \
	asm \
	asm \
#ifdef FOO \
	asm \
	asm \
#else \
	asm \
#endif \
	asm \
	asm
Interesting, isn't it? The fun part was that it was compiling cleanly
in 3.2, but not in 2.95.
Sadly, noone bothered to compile this with 2.95 for a long time.
