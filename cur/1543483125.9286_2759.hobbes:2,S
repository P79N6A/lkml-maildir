Great! Mostly works for me with 2.0.1 and obviously is a good idea, but...
  echo -ne '\33[11m\304'; echo -e '\304\33[10m'
This gives Ä and a horizontal line (most of the time - once didn't).
Should be two horizontal line segments. Some of Midnight Commander's
borders are taken from the user-loaded ACM instead of CP-437; above is
an extracted simple case which shows the bug.
