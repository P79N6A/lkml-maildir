This actually isn't needed for the first case as SE401_NUMSBUF is 1 but
the second fix is needed. Both are right and useful to merge in case
NUMSBUF is ever changed.
If you know se401->sbuf[] and se401->scratch , urb etc are being cleared
to NULL (or you did that) you could just use the kfree loops in nomem_
for all cases as kfree(NULL) is an allowed "no-op"
