Yes, I have started, but there is no code yet. I will most likely receive
some hardware in a few weeks time, so in the mean time, I'm just reading
the specs.

BTW: I thought the MIP people would be more interested in 802.11 then BT,
since the trend is that laptops are now delivered with 802.11 as the Rf
wireless technology. BT is will also find its way into laptops, but the
main application will be to do point-to-point ac-hoc networking with small
devices such as mobile phones etc.
