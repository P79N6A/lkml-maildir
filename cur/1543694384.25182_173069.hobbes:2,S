IF the amount of data is small, say a word or two or less, you can use the 
siginfo and a realtime signal.  This will get the data at the same time as the 
signal.  If you prefer to avoid the overhead of the signal, you can do 
sigwaitinfo() which avoids the floating point save/restore, but does require the 
task to wait (i.e. is not asynchronous).
