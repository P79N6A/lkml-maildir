Some time ago, I've had the same problem booting gentoo-1.4-rc2 with my Promise PDC20276, I had to append "acpi=off", otherwise the kernel-image of the cdrom suffered from the same problems... Maybe that'll help to get your production-server back online? 
However, I couldn't determine whether you are using ACPI, perhaps not. Personally, I wouldn't choose to use power-management (neither apm nor acpi) on a server in the first place, but that's just me...
