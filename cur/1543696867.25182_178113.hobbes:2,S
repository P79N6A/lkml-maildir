Looking here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/2/15/96
it didn't seem so, but it's not that makes a huge difference.

I really would like to know from Peter/DaveM how many hits the rsync of 
the CVS repo at kernel.org has. If really a few cats are looking at it and 
if for BM is an hassle to support it, we have to ask ourselves if it is 
worth. Both for kernel.org maintainers and for BM.
(rsync on CVS repo on kernel.org does not give me any new data by days)
