Agreed. Integrity attestation clearly needed to be tightly coupled with
integrity measurement.

It was certainly agreed that integrity needed to be a separate service
available to any access control module, with nothing specific to SLIM, 
and that a number of design and implementation problems had to be fixed. 
During testing we also found a number of other bugs which weren't raised 
on the list, which had to be fixed. (That's what has taken us so long to 
post a new version.) As to whether it should be tightly coupled to an
LSM module, or should be a separate service with its own kernel hooks,
I think was not settled.

I seem to recall a number of people arguing for the low water-mark 
integrity policy as one which provides a simple, user friendly 
policy, one which has been demonstrated and tested not only by
SLIM, but also with predecessors, such as LOMAC. 
I do understand and respect the selinux position against dynamic 
labels, since they require revocation, and particularly since at 
that time, we had not implemented revocation of mmap access. We 
have been quietly studying, fixing, and testing the design and
implementation errors pointed out earlier, and still feel strongly 
that low water-mark policies have a place, particularly in client
systems. 
Since selinux (by choice) cannot implement policies with dynamic labels,
I believe LSM is important for work in alternative access control
models, like low water-mark, to continue.
