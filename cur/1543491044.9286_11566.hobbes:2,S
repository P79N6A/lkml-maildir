Both getdtablesize and RLIMIT_NOFILE are only relevant for newly opened
descriptors.  See f.ex. the manual page on SunOS4:
     The call getdtablesize() returns the current  value  of  the
     soft  limit  component  of the RLIMIT_NOFILE resource limit.
     This resource limit governs the maximum value  allowable  as
     the index of a newly created descriptor.
This means that in your szenario you would still be able to use all
descriptors, but dup2(1001,1000) would fail, and dup2(1001,255) would not.
