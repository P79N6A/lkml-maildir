I believe this issue is a result of the aacraid_commit_reset patch (as
posted for scsi-misc-2.6, enclosed to permit testing) not yet propagated
to the 2.6.22-rc3 tree.
This is the adapter taking longer than 3 minutes to start after a reset.
I seriously doubt either of these patches suggested below will have an
affect. And if they do, they are not root cause, one reduces the chances
that the card will be reset during initialization (thus applied would
likely mitigate this problem), the other prevents a panic when the
Adapter is reset (removed, would result in dogs and cats sleeping with
each other).
Please use kernel parameter aacraid.startup_timeout=540 (merely larger
than the default 180 seconds) when spawning the kexec or see if the
aacraid_commit_reset.patch resolves the issue to confirm my hunch.
Sincerely -- Mark Salyzyn
