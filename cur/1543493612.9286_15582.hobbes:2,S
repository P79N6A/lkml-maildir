Then set a few bits in securebits or don't use root for your cap-enhanced
process. One thing I hope my patch to have is to have you able to config a
stricter kernel compile if you want that type of thing by setting the
global securebits.
Also hint most programs weren't designed to handle any caps besides(I am
god aka root) and most weren't designed with even that as a consideration.
The patch should have provision to set securebits on a per process basis
or a global basis. That way you can have a mostly compatible system that
has a developemental "soiled" cap-aware apache that marks securebits for
its process so you can track down problems on a per program basis instead
of dealing with the whole of user-space all at once.
After all of the user-space you care about has been corrected then you can
throw on the super strict. Anyway I should have a new version of the patch
out later today or tommorrow.
Then you can tell me if you like or hate my use of the securebits. OK

Warning when I mention capabilites I mean "soiled" capabilities not "pure".
Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
