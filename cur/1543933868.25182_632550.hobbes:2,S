The device ID's are different 0x000C in ldusb.c vrs 0x000b in the
driver I just posted.
Have you read my patch yet?

The libusb based FW loader 
http://www.internetking.org/fsusb/
 program
is nasty and didn't work on one of my systems, so I refactored it into
a kernel driver and python program.

Why not?
There are a lot of redundant things in the world.  Linux is not
necessary if you really want to take this argument to its extreme.

Yup thats the code.  I found it way complex to read and felt a simple
kernel driver and simple python program much nicer to my
sensibilities.
We are getting quickly getting into a fuzzy/ opinion, area on this
thread.  Is there a technical angle we can discuss?  My LOC count of
the kernel driver and boot loader is smaller than the fsusb thing.
Also, with a kernel driver and a python lib, a GUI based boot loader
utility can be had with little effort.

You blogging about me already?
I wont comment on that.
