You don't need a slow disk, it's trivial to provoke 256 sector sized
request on even the fastest disk available. People hit it all the time,
just with working drives...

The 256 is _not_ a bug in the driver, it's more likely a bug in your
drive. 256 is a perfectly legal transfer size. That said, maybe it is
a good idea to leave it at 255 just for safety on drives not handling
0 sectors == 128kB transfer.
