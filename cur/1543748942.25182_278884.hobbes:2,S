Recently I discovered that calling "joe /etc" on FreeBSD opens the directory 
itself (rather than erroring out with EISDIR). The byte string looked like a 
number of "struct dirent"s. Did it break apps in BSD? I donot think so.
(Hell, I just voted _for_ the directory-as-a-file and vice-versa stuff, I'm 
never gonna regret it to myself :)

I would not rely on that. Many apps strip a trailing slash (just to add it 
later again) or vice versa!

What will ls do? Consider this on a "normal" filesystem:
ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1614 Dec 12 23:57 /etc/passwd
ls -l /etc
[lots of files]
What will happen on v4 then?
ls -l /etc
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 123456 Dec 01 23:45 /etc
ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Dec 01 23:45 root
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Dec 01 23:45 jengelh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Dec 01 23:45 daemon
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Dec 01 23:45 sys
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Dec 01 23:45 stduser
It's because "ls" checks the type of the argument to decide what to do (unless
you add -d).
