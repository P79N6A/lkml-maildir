Wow, I'm surprised.  I suppose I do jump to thinking of heavy swapping
when light swapping won't be so bad; but even so, 20x ext3 astonishes
me - ext3 wouldn't be anyone's choice for fastest, but even so...
I certainly guess too much and measure too little:
is there a useful test you could point me to?  TIA
