Hi Eric,

Hmm, restricting System RAM only may be too pessimistic.
(One of motivations of this work is for using /dev/mem safely.
 "dd if=/dev/mem of=xxx" causes panic on my amd64(8GB mem) machine
 since reading from address around 0xfe000000 causes a machine
 check. hmm, this area is marked as "reserved". not ACPI area.
 ACPI area can be read.)
Ok, I will add a type field.

Do you mean defining a data structure in linux/mmzone.h ?
I used to think a particular struct is not necessary for this work,
but now I think it is better to define a struct for this.
Let me consider.

I am looking forward this :-)

How about this ?
Thanks.
