You are mistaken.  The cruft in drivers/sgi mostly dates back to the
attempts on the SGI Indy platform to get SGI's IRIX X server *binary*
running under Linux (note that this work was NOT done by SGI).
The SGI Visual Workstation work was mostly done within the i386 arch
code; the framebuffer driver (sgivwfb.[ch]) was put in drivers/video;
and some other drivers had some modifications that were guarded
by CONFIG_VISWS or CONFIG_VISWS_HACKS.  (There was also a project that
enabled multi-process accelerated/direct-rendered graphics on that
platform, but that code was never released due to the fact that the
project was killed the week it was demonstrated at SIGGRAPH'99.)
