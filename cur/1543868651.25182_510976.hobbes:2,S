It can be recvfrom only problem - syscall overhead on my p4 (core duo,
debian testing) is bout 300 usec - to test I ran 
read('dev/zero', &data, 0)
in a loop.
Could you try to hack recvfrom() for your socket to always copy some
empty buffer and check the results without waiting for packet?
If you are not hurry I can test it myself tomorrow.
