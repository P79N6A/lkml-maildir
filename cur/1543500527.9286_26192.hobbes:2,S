Thanks for the help fromall of you so far.  I have downloaded kdb but
haven't figured out how to use it yet.  It looks scary to recompile all
kernel which is required by involving kdb.  I will try it later.
One question now.  When call pci_find_device(), the returned base address
are:
base[0]= 0     (Reserved, in our case) 
base[1]= 6501  (Low IO Address)
base[2]= 6601  (Hi IO Address) 
base[3]= e10600000  (MEM Base)
base[4]= e10000008  (RAM Base)
base[5]= e10400000  (SROM Base)
The base address 3, 4, 5 look like virtual address.  Is that true? 
In my driver, after I get those address, it was converted to virtual address
with bus_to_virt() function call.  If the returned address is virtual, then
no need to convert.
Thanks!

The oops always occurs from a CPU page fault, and because it is coming
from software the fault address is always virtual.  And yes, it looks
like a physical address: that's the entire reason for the oops, you
have tried to dereference an invalid virtual address.
The important thing to look for in the oops is the EIP and the stack
trace: that tells you exactly where in the kernel the fault occurred,
and what the call trace on the stack looks like.  ksymoops (in
linux/scripts) will decode this.

gzip/gunzip.  The kernel source is in the kernel-source rpm, though.
