eth1394: I emailed Steve Kinneberg, the last person to do any serious
work on the driver,  before I made this change, and he's OK with that.
If someone else wants to take it, I suggest they submit a patch.

Ben is currently listed for ieee1394, ohci1394, and raw1394.  Someone
should take sbp2 now that it's being worked on actively again, but I'll
leave that up to you two.
