At least for the kiobuf case the notion of IO in flight is hold in the
iobuf->io_count, about the reference count there isn't a reference count
at all on those bh, they're just an array of ram in the iobuf.
Infact the b_count is also never read, exactly because the notion of
reference-count/in-flight-I/O doesn't belong there.
One valid argument is to do the same thing before all sumbit_bh which
doesn't seem to have a big value to me at the moment, maybe I'm wrong
in the long term but certainly at this moment that sounds more like
wasted cpu than cleaner code.
so I guess I'd prefer something like this:

(personally I guess I'd still prefer to do the same for the async-IO
handler, but for it at least the b_count is checked eventually by
somebody [try_to_free_pages] so it somehow make more sense even if in
practice it isn't not needed there either)
