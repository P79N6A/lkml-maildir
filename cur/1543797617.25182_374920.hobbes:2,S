I don't, but I do use a script that mknods the real root's node based on 
running "find" against /sys to locacate the appropriate device name and then 
finding the major/minor numbers there.
This has nothing whatsoever to do with ipw2200.  It just means I'm not using 
the in-kernel root-finder code.

That's now how I'd fix this.  If you want to fix it this way, be my guest.

Or I could move initramfs extraction earlier in the boot sequence and never 
have to modify any _other_ drivers that want firmware in order to be able to 
make them work too, rather than playing whack-a-mole teaching drivers I don't 
care about how to hold off on wanting firmware.

I do not think it means what you think it means.
