NAK, this is wrong:

This basically reverses the order of locking between lock_super() and
journal_start() (the latter acts like a lock because it can block on a
resource if the journal is too full for the new transaction.)  That's
the opposite order to normal, and will result in a potential deadlock.

Right, that's disabled for now.  I guess the easy fix here is just to
remove the code entirely, given that we have locking problems with
trying to fix it!
But the _right_ fix, if you really want to keep that code, is probably
to move all the resize locking to a separate lock that ranks outside the
journal_start.  The easy workaround is to drop the superblock lock and
reaquire it around the journal_start(); it would be pretty easy to make
that work robustly as far as ext3 is concerned, but I suspect there may
be VFS-layer problems if we start dropping the superblock lock in the
middle of the s_ops->remount() call --- Al?
