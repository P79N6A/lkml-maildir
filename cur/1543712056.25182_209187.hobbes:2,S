Subject: laptop issues: is there a driver for gigabyte wireless?

I'm contemplating a prostar laptop (8794 model).  As far as I can tell
everything should work fine, except I don't know about the 802.11g wireless,
which is Gigabyte GN-WIAG.
Anyone know if this device will work under any 2.4 or 2.6 kernels?
I got no hits on the kernel mailing list archive, so maybe someone knows
more about it.
If you know of any other issues with other h/w in this laptop, I'd appreciate
hearing about it.
ATI Radeon 9700 
  Should work, w/o acceleration, right?  If not, I need to know ASAP
Promise PDC20265R raid controller 
  If raid doesn't work, it's not a problem, as long as I can see the disks.
  I saw some stuff about "lost interrupt hell" on the lkml archives, but
  nothing definitive.  Also all old.
3D Realtek sound ALC650 Codec 2.2
  I see recent ALSA updates for this under 2.6, so I assume I'm fine here.
thanks,
