Pretty much - need to leave i_size where it was.  But there are
apparently reasons why NFS cannot sleepingly lock pages in this particular
context.

Oh absolutely.
 unsigned long radix_tree_gang_lookup(void **pointers,
		unsiged long starting_from_here, unsigned long this_many);
could be used nicely in readahead, drop_behind, truncate, invalidate
and invalidate2.  But to use it in writeback (desirable) we would need
additional metadata in radix_tree_node.  One bit per page, which means
"this page is dirty" or "this subtree has dirty pages".
I keep saying this in the hope that someone will take pity and write it.

heh.  We still do have some O_DIRECT/pagecache coherency problems.
