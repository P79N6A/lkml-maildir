Bernd, 
   The server runs RHEL Trial Version, without support... for tests purpose. 
   When I compile and run the following tester program: 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
int main (void) { 
        int n = 0; 
        char *p; 
        while (1) { 
                if ((p = malloc(1<<20)) == NULL) { 
                        printf("malloc failure after %d MiB\n", n); 
                        return 0; 
                } 
                memset (p, 0, (1<<20)); 
                printf ("got %d MiB\n", ++n); 
        } 
} 
   The server alocates lots of free memory (including swap) to the tester 
program and when its finish, lots of cached memory are freed. 
   Have someone an idea why it's happens? Or how can I force the kernel to 
frees cached memory? 
Thanks again (sorry my bad eglish again!)
