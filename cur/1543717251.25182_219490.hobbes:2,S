The answer here is probably to make quotas work for shmfs, tmpfs,
hugetlbfs, etc. This shouldn't be too bad except for quotactl(2)
insists on having a block special device to manipulate quotas. Adding
an fquotactl(file descriptor, ...) should deal with that.
The mlock rlimits probably still make sense even once this is in place.
