Adds swap and dies.
Looks like the mount process oopses.
This was an SMP kernel but running on a UP box. 32MB RAM CPU is a 200MMX.
Compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3 with adaptec AHA-2940 SCSI and Netgear ethernet.
would run ksymoops but I can't compile it ... can't find bfd.h ?? (debian
system)
Note that 2.3.7-pre5 did the same thing ... I installed a fresh 2.3.6 tree
and patched it, no change.
I know this is not much help, would probably be better if I could get
ksymoops running.
