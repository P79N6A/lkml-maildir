IMHO this is not really a cleanup.  When the demand fault patch stack
was first accepted, we decided to separate out find_or_alloc_huge_page()
because it has the page_cache retry loop with several exit conditions.
no_page() has its own backout logic and mixing the two makes for a
tangled mess.  Can we leave that hunk out please?
