You've not detailed your load. I assume it consists of lots of small files
being transferred over 10 apache processes? I also assume you max out your
system using apachebench? 
In general, Linux systems are not maxed out as they will disappoint that way
(like any system running with id=0). 
So yes, what you do is a 'rare load' as anybody trying to do this will
disappoint his users.
And any tweak you make to the scheduler this way is bound to affect another
load.
