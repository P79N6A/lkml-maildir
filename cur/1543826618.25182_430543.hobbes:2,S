I am trying to create a patch for this problem and it just dawned on me,
how does one store the previous state in a suspend/resume path if the code
hotplugs all the cpus first?  CPU0 is easy because an explicit
suspend/resume path is called, but it seems to be called last after all
the other cpus have been removed.  How do I save the state?
Is there a recommened way of doing this?  Or can I assume that
__cpu_disable/enable is only called by the suspend/resume subsystem?
Thanks.
Cheers,
Don
