No, debug the kernel while its running on the 386. And what of my other
concerns?
1. It doesn't appear to be simple and elegant.
2. It would drive developers nuts if it was used for anything other than
   a couple of critical functions (cache size would be one).
3. Are there valid situations where you would need it? This isn't a
   rhetorical question. Your example would be fine if somebody really
   needed to do that.
