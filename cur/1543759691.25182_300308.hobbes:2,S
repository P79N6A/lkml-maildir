I think you would have better luck in reproducing this problem if you
did the full sendfile thing.
I think it is becoming disk bound due to page reclaim problems, which
is causing the slowdown.
In that case, writing the network only test would help to confirm the
problem is not a networking one - so not useless by any means.
