Setting the referenced bit on not (yet) used readahead
pages could have the damaging side effect of swapping
out pages from the working set in preference to the
readahead pages.
OTOH, without some special trick for linear access the
VM will prefer to swap out the pages we're about to use
(the readahead pages) instead of the pages we just used
-- the absolute worst thing for sequential IO.
One simple solution which achieves both the effect of
dropping the right pages in a sequential IO stream and
making sure that not-used readahead pages aren't pushing
out the working set would be drop-behind.
I know drop-behind isn't the prettiest thing, but it's
simple and it works.
regards,
Rik
