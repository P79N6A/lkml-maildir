But don't forget that when dirty buffers are being flushed, they become
locked while the disk update is occuring. That means any programs that are
still using these "young" dirty buffers must wait for disk io to complete
(including all the older buffers that have to be written to disk before
it). When several hundred other buffers are slso being flushed to disk by
kupdated , it could be a long wait.
Also, it is nicer behaviour not to write out to disk before the time
indicated in the bdflush tuning structure. It allows sys admins to better
tune the overal performace of a system. (unless the kernel need s more
free memory)
Have fun
