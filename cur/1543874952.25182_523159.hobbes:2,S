It isn't very nice.  It probably won't crash, but it _can_ crash and when
it does, the results will be very obscure and people who will be affected
by the crash will be badly $impacted$ by it.
Perhaps as a middle-ground thing we could simply ban the creation of
cpusets hierarchies which are more than <mumble> layers deep.
Or, worse, we could take a peek at the depth of the tree before starting
the recursion, then just fail out if it exceeds <mumble>
Or, worse still, we could allow the recursion to proceed down <mumble>
levels, then refuse to apply the reconciliation any deeper.
Best would be to avoid the recursion ;) lib/radix-tree.c has a similar
problem, and has a possibly-conceptually-applicable solution.  It has a
fixed maximum depth so it uses a local array, but it could use kmalloc()
for the radix_tree_path.
Is there any sane way in which we can perform the recursion in userspace? 
Get the application to walk the hierarchy and do the fixups at each node? 
Probably not...

Good idea.
