Why are you afraid of that?  Yes I am sure it is 0.9.2.  I do
have a 0.9.0-rc6 patch on my site which is derived in part from
your wolk code.  But that is a different animal,
To make my 082_alsa-0.9.2.bz2 patch, I used the wolk 0.9.0-rc6
code, a copy of alsa-driver-0.9.2.tar.bz2, and a copy of the
latest 2.5.x kernel source for reference.  I then hacked on it
for a few hours till I made it work.
    <sound of checking>
Hahaha!  It looks like I copied my 0.9.0-rc6 patch over the top
of my 0.9.2 patch!  Oops.  I still have the source tree where I
hacked together the 0.9.2 kernel patch, so I'll regenerate that
and re-post it after I get some sleep.  <yawns, rubs eyes>
