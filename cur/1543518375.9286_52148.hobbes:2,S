poll() and select() are pretty commonly overriden, though: if you want
to do user-space threads, as with Communicator 4.x (and Mozilla, if you
build it with the right options), you want to override lots of
potentially-blocking IO operations to schedule your threads
accordingly.  I think this is how the green-threads JVMs work, too.
Any program that wants to use the boehm collector will also override
malloc(), and that seems like a pretty reasonable thing to want to do.
