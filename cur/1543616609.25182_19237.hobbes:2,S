Subject: Problem with ServerWorks CNB20LE and lost interrupts

Unfortunately my most recent load of servers cam with ServerWorks
CNB20LE chipsets.  They work ok with linux, except when I use the PCI
slots, their interrupts get lost.
I am hoping someone is familiar with such a problem and might suggest
either a solution or at least a plan of attack.
I encountered it first with the ieee1394 ohci driver, but that is 
experimental, so I installed a 3c59x card instead and confirm the
problem there as well.
The 3c59x will receive exactly one packet after being ifconfig-ed up.
This packet's data will be corrupt.  It gets turned to zeros after 4-8 bytes
or so of data.  No more packets will be received until I "ifconfig down"
and back up.
The machines are dual processor boxes with a single processor installed.
I have tried many kernels with no appreciable difference, 2.4.17 is typical.
All of the devices on the primary bus work correctly, it is just the
ones on the secondary base that are goofed.  For instance, on this
machine it is just the last one that is ill.
