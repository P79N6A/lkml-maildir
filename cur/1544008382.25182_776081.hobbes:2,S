But once this set is introduced a HTTP server could be written that uses
forked children to handle requests, that have their identity swtiched
before doing any work, including parsing CGI scripts.
This does not only apply to HTTP servers though, there are many cases
where it is nessacary to become a user, ie, to deliver email to the
user's home directory.

The idea is to not allow the child to change its own uid, or give the
child any elevated privlages so that should the child be compromised via
buffer overflow or some other bug, it cant be abused.

I would welcome more information as to how this can break applications
as I am very new to kernel hacking and would like to solve this
performance vs security problem once and for all.
