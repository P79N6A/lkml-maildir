so there could be two guests, unified (i.e. sharing 
most of the files as hardlinks), where the first one
holds 80% of the resulting pages, and the second one
20%, and thus shows much lower 'RSS' usage as the
other one, although it is running the very same
processes and providing identical services?

so the system (physical machine) starts reclaiming
and probably swapping even when there is no need
to do so?
e.g. a system with a single guest, limited to 10k
pages, with a working set of 15k pages in different
apps would continuously swap (trash?) on an otherwise
unused (100k+ pages) system?

is that really what we want?
I think we can do _better_ than a standalone machine
and in many cases we really should ...
