Hi,
Is anyone working on generic Frame Relay driver for Linux? I know there
is Sangoma driver available, but it's for use with Sangoma cards only,
and FR is done in card's firmware. I want a driver which is able to speak
FR using plain HDLC interface.
I think extending syncppp should be the way to go. Any suggestions?
If no one is working on it, I'm going to give it a try.
Anyone having a detailed description of FR (for example - different LMIs)
protocol/frames?
