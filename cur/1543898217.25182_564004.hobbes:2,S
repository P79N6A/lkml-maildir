Why do you want to stick everything inside a structure, with nested 
strctures and unions, when they clearly are separate contexts?
Also, unions don't work if you want to pass multiple contexts at a time.
You need your structure to contains *all* the possible contexts.
You do not want to sell the monster-struct-union by branding an extra 
__get_user(), do you?
On top of that, the single pointer to the compat multi-context strcture, 
will force the kernel to decide which one of the members is actually valid 
or not. The set/unset callbacks separate each context from a structure POV 
and from a setup/teardown POV, and allow the kernel to use their native 
data structures. Think about if we had this for the latest 
pselect/ppoll/epoll_pwait. Think about how your solution and mine would 
apply to that very much concrete case.
