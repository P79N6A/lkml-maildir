Probably yes if it won't see it during boot. But if RedHat is patching
their kernels with ide you may try to get newer setup disks images...
Or you can use disk utils to set it to U33/U66 mode (if this is needed of
course), plug it into on-board ide controller (there must be some other
ide controller on the mobo) and install RedHat distro.
Then get newer kernel from RedHat or compiled yourself, plug disk into
HPT370 and set it to U100.
