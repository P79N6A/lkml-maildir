What can we assume about the alignment of the bitmap pointer passed to
the ext2_{set,clear}_bit_atomic functions?  Can we assume that they
will be aligned to an long boundary (8 bytes on 64-bit)?
Olof has made a patch that uses atomics for these on ppc64 rather than
locking and unlocking a lock, but it will only work correctly if the
bitmap is always 8-byte aligned.
Paul.
