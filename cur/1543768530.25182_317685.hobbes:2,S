They do place a limit on athe sgpool entries in scsi_lib.c.  I'm curious 
about the overhead from these data structures, hence the experimentation.

The system is a pretty standard P4 with SATA on ICH6.  I tried booting 
with MAX_SECTORS = 31 (with *_SEGMENTS = 32) to no avail.  The system 
usually gets to some point in early userland init with whatever program 
(init) being stuck in D state waiting for io to complete.  I'm curious 
if there is some unwritten dependancy on MAX_SEGMENT_SIZE or some other 
piece of code being hit here...
