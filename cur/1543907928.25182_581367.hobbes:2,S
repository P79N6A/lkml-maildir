Fair enough.  Casting to (volatile int *) will give us the behavior people 
expect when using atomic_t without needing to use inefficient barriers.
While we have the hood up, should we convert all the atomic_t's to non-volatile 
and put volatile casts in all the atomic_reads?  I don't know enough about the 
various arches to say with confidence that those changes alone will preserve 
existing behavior.  We might need some arch-specific tweaking of the atomic 
operations.
