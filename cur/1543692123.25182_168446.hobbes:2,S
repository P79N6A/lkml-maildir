Hi.
Anyone know how to get the Nforce2 ethernet working with a free driver?
I dont want to use binary shite on this box if I can help it...
I heard it was similar to the 8111e ethernet but changing the PCI IDs
didnt make it work (surprise surprise). It did seem to insmod and make
an attempt to do something but the MAC address was all zeros.
anyone got further than this?
