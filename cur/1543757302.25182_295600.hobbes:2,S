Hi Linux,
Special one time promotion only. No charge membership site for life! Use credit card for age verification purposes only! Then you are in. Their hopes are they get you in then you like it so much you want to upgrade to buy another product. It's up to you! Your choice.

You never know what you can do till you try. 
Hasty judgements are generally faulty. . From trivial things, great contests often arise. . Windows will never cease. . It's no use closing the stable door, after the horse has bolted. .
Oh, what a tangled web site we weave when first we practice.

The gods help them that help themselves. . From trivial things, great contests often arise. . As is the gardener so is the garden. .
A good thing is all the sweeter when won with pain. . Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. . Kill two birds with the one stone. .
Divide and conquer. . A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody. . Speak clearly, if you speak at all. .
