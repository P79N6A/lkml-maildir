The i386 ELF ABI spec _does_ specify that.

The caller assumes nothing; the caller is _guaranteed_ the register
rules described in the i386 ELF ABI.
Compiler writers will sometimes simply avoid registers they must save
and restore across function calls.  That allows them to avoid push'ing
and pop'ing outside of calling another function.
