This makes me wonder if using a per-cpu tasklet in my patch
is a bad idea after all. Perhaps Ingo had figured it out already
and used a single acquisition of global_bh_lock to fire
timers for all CPUs when timers get deferred from the local
timer interrupt.
In an ideal world where there are no BHs, we can parallelize
the timers like I did. But with global_bh_lock serialization,
I am not sure anymore if that is a good idea. I will try to
get some benchmark measurements done with these two approaches.

AFAICS, no. But then I am still learning.
