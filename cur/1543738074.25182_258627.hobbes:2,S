Well it isn't my problem. It's a kernel problem that only exists
in 2.6.n kernels. Versions 2.4.x work fine. And what are you
bitching for? You have the entire source-code.
Further, it exists in a dummy driver that impliments a dummy
open(), close(), and ioctl().
Once a character-device module is installed, then removed. If
you attempt to open() the module again, instead of the kernel
reloading it, it crashes. The last thing executed is
sys_open(). It should have stopped at chrdev_open(), but
the code is broken.
