Argg.  Not holding back this patch, but could you please fix cpqarray
to pass around objects instead of indices?  That's how 90% of the drivers
work, it makes the code more redable and removes global arrays that limit
the max number of devices supported.

Why can't cpqarray_init_step2 be inlined in cpqarray_init directly?
Why is cpqarray_init non-static?
And what's the issue with EISA and PCI?  If you converted the driver
to the proper device-model based EISA probing API supporting both should
be really easy.

You probably want a del_timer_sync here.

How can the gendisk be non up?

Rather silly check.  if pci_get_drvdata(pdev) returns NULL the pci code
would be really badly hosed in which case a panic because of a NULL pointer
dereference is probably the best thing to keep the box from corrupting even
more data.
