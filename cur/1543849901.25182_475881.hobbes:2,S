Hi
stress tests on a 6.3T ext3 filesystem which runs on top of software
raid 6 revealed the following:
[663594.224641] init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (4412)
[663596.355652] init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (5123)
[663596.355832] init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (71562)
[many of these]
[663763.319514] EXT3-fs error (device md0): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - blocks from 517570560, length 1
[663763.322680] Aborting journal on device md0.
[663763.331877] ext3_abort called.
[663763.333591] EXT3-fs error (device md0): ext3_journal_start_sb: Detected aborted journal
[663763.337386] Remounting filesystem read-only
[663763.339423] EXT3-fs error (device md0): ext3_free_blocks: Freeing blocks in system zones - Block = 517570560, count = 1
[663763.343880] EXT3-fs error (device md0) in ext3_free_blocks_sb: Journal has aborted
[663764.959828] __journal_remove_journal_head: freeing b_committed_data
[663764.962557] __journal_remove_journal_head: freeing b_committed_data
[663764.965257] __journal_remove_journal_head: freeing b_committed_data
This is kernel 2.6.18.1 on ppc64 (G5). The filesystem was created with
	mkfs.ext3 -b 4096 /dev/md0
This system is currently not in production use, so I can use it for tests ATM.
