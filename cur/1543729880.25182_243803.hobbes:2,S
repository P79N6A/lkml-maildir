Hi,
I was playing with MMX, SSE and non-temporal page zeroing
and page-copying routines for quite a bit now.
NB: the CPU is Duron Applebred 1750MHz 64k L1 + 64k L2.
In short, this is what I found:
* MMX and SSE routines are very close in speed.
  Both are 5-10% faster than "rep stosd/rep movsd" ones.
* Aligning main loop gives 0-2% speedup.
* Prefetching data in copy loop gives 5-10% speedup.
* Using non-temporal stores gives 50-300% speedup,
  but copied data end up stored in main memory, not in cache.
Are non-temporal stores a win or a loss? We need to measure
not just a zero_page / copy_page speed, but also speed of
subsequent access for page data. Here's what I found:
* In small-footprint testing which fits entirely in L1 dcache,
  NT zero_page() is actually a loss if we are reading zeroed-out
  page afterwards. Since CPU typically uses write-allocate,
  we end up reading page even if code only writes into it.
* HOWEVER, I was unable to demonstrate that NT copy_page() routine
  is a loss when we read copied data back. Whatever I tried (small,
  medium, large dataset), NT copy_page() is *faster* than non-NT one.
* This contradicts Arjan's results - he says that NT is a loss.
  (I still would like to try to reproduce his testing. Arjan?)
How can that be? Below you will find all the gory details, thoughts,
and means to reproduce and/or test on different CPU.
Typically copy_page is done when kernel need to un-COW
a page when one of the forked processes wants
to write to a page, and I used
	alloc(buf);
	for(;;) { fork(); use(buf); }
code for copy_page() benchmarking.
It turned out that kernel zeroes out 3 pages and copies 8 more
pages on each fork, and, obviously, kernel does NOT use entire 44k
of resultant data. It accesses some 100 bytes here and there, and
that's all. Thus, testing shows that NT ops are a win for fork().
If I use smallish mmap'ed buffer so that sizeof(buffer)+44k still fits
into L1, speed gains from fork() outweigh losses due to slower access
to NT-copied pages.
If I use larger buffer and sizeof(buffer)+44k does not fit in cache,
NT-copy wins hands down, as expected.
Commented test results below. SSE results are omitted (very close to MMX).
Test programs/scripts and kernel code are in attached tarball.
Each tes was run 5 times, results are sorted.
NNN/MMM == NNN zero_page, MMM copy_page calls were made.
slow == rep stosd / rep movsd routines
mmx_APn == aligned loop, using prefetch, NOT using non-temporal stores
mmx_APN == aligned loop, using prefetch, using non-temporal stores
mmx_APn/APN == use NT only for copy (zero_page is non-NT)
NT zero_page() is a clear loss for small buffer (which is the most
used and most important case):

Ok, now, copy_page() testing:
NB: each copy test does one fork per one loop.
With each fork, kernel zeroes out 3 pages and copies 8 pages.
This amounts to 12k+32k bytes.

Dominated by fork() overhead. NT again wins! Probably because fork()
does not read back entire 44k of zeroed/copied memory.
I'd like to try some non-forking workload. Is there ANY workload
which will be faster on non-NT copy_page() than on NT one?
Comments?
