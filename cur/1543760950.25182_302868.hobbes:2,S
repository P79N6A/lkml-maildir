Subject: Fix irq_affinity write from /proc for IPF

Hi Andrew/Tony
This patch is required for IPF to perform deferred write to rte's when
affinity is programmed via /proc. These entries can only be programmed when 
interrupt is pending.
We will eventually need the same method for x86 and x86_64 as well. 
This patch is only for IPF though. (the others are comming, more testing and
changes needed in my sandbox)
Could you please queue this up for next mm candidate? if it looks acceptable.
Since iam touching a common file for GENERIC_HARDIRQ, it would be best it its
reviwed in the -mm releases for any potential conflicts.
[ sorry for the cross post to lia64 ]

fix_ia64_smp_affinity - Make GENERIC_HARDIRQ work for IPF and CPU Hotplug
Signed-off-by: Ashok Raj <ashok.raj@intel.com>
Made GENERIC_HARDIRQ mechanism work for IPF and CPU hotplug. When write to 
/proc/irq is handled it is not appropriate to perform set_rte immediatly, 
since there is a race when the interrupt is asserted while the re-program 
is happening. Hence such programming is only safe when we do the re-program 
at the time of servicing an interrupt. This got broken when GENERIC_HARDIRQ 
got introduced for IPF.
- added CONFIG_PENDING_IRQ so default /proc/irq write handler can do the right 
  thing.
TBD: We currently dont handle redirectable hint either in the display, or when
we handle writes to /proc/irq/XX/smp_affinity. We need an arch specific way to 
account for the presence of "r" hint when we handle the proc write.
