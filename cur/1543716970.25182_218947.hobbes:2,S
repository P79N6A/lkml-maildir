I run Debian to do this all the time. If you run the stable distro, it doens't
have all bleeding edge desktop crap, but it does have the major advantage of
actually working, and being perfectly stable. Getting it to run 2.6 needs
a few small updates, but nothing hard. 
Testing is very solid too, has 2.6 support out of the box, and more updated 
desktop stuff (I run that on my laptop). Unstable seems more stable than most
vendors shipped distros to me, but changes more rapidly. They also seem to
break serial console occasionally in unstable by loading fonts into it 
(idiots!), but that's trivial to fix.
The fact that their own kernel packages are so close to mainline probably 
helps a lot ;-)
