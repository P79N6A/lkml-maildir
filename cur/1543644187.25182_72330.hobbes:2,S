Well, it depends on if you really need the complex form or not.
There are some people who use a format of:
	%N.%P.core
which places the core file in the current directory but adds in the
name of the program.  (Something that is very nice when you have
a lot of programs that may core "together" when something bad happens)
The string processing is not that much work anyway (very small)
and, given the fact that I am about to write to disk a core dump,
it can not be a critical path/fast path issue either :-)
What can be done at the default pattern level in later kernels
would be to make it a bit more than just "core" (such as maybe
the "%N.%P.core" or something like that) but that is not that
complex.
Also, FreeBSD (yes, I know, it is not Linux) has a very simular
feature that we used for the FreeBSD clusters we built.
