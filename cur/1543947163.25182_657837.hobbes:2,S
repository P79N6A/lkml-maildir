Module loading doesn't involve stop_machine last time I checked.  It's a
big deal when unloading a module but it's actually a very good trade off
because it makes much hotter path (module_get/put) much cheaper.  If
your application can't stand stop_machine, simply don't unload a module.

This I don't know nothing about. :-)
