Good. The whole idea of cdrom_log_sense is to be able to cleanly
limit the (often) sense-less (yes, haha :) ide-cd verbosity. Some of the
css stuff are obvious candidates. We want users to be aware of the
error, but often we end up flooding the logs with the same stuff over
and over again. This is often a source of confusion for the casual
user.
