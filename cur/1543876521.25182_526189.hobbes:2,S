Hi Li,
well, the drivers are exceptions from the generic handling, so creating an 
exceptional rule (entry in hid_blacklist) for them is not that bad. OK, 
it's not the nicest thing on earth probably, but serves the purpose in 
current vendors-trying-to-break-hardware-in-the-most-original-way world 
quite well.
This is going to cause some headache to out-of-tree drivers. Oh well, do 
we care that much? 
In your scenario you'll still need a way how to unbind the device from the 
hid driver and bind it to the new specific device, won't you?. This could 
be done by a separate userspace program, but well ... I think just 
blacklisting the hardware is much cleaner, than needing to ship a separate 
userspace program along with the driver.
Thanks,
