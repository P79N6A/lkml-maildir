Subject: [2.6.28-rc7 PATCH] Make Bluetooth rfkill work on EeePC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

"echo 1 >/sys/class/rfkill/rfkill1/state" was failing with "no such device"
on my 901. This fixes it.

This needs Bernd Spaeth's sign-off too (and promptly!) since I took this from
the patch which he posted to debian-eeepc-devel. URL:
