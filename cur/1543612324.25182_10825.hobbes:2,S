Search for "SMB FILESYSTEM" in the MAINTAINERS file.
Most documentation for smbfs is packaged with samba as the smbmount/smbmnt
manpages. What sort of things would you like to put in smbfs.txt?
Some of the texts in Documentation/filesystems should IMHO be manpages of
their own (example: vfat lists all options there, why not make a manpage
like nfs(5))
