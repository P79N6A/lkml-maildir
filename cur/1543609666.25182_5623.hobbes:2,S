DAC960.c doesn't know about BLKELVSET / BLKELVGET, and control is
only passed down to the generic ioctl in the case of BLKBSZSET,
and doesn't have a default: entry in the switch statement of
DAC960_IOCTL()
I've not seen one of these devices, so I'm not sure if this makes
sense or not, but passing on requests to the lower level should
be a simple..
	default:
		return( blk_ioctl(Inode->i_rdev, Request, Argument));
Addition.
There may be other reasons this driver doesn't provide the
elevator ioctls though.
regards,
Dave.
