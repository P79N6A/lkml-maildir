You should bring this up on the arch list or it is likely to be missed by people 
who would give you useful feedback.

I realize to preserve the behavior you currently get with the cmpxchg currently 
used to implement atomic_add_unless that you feel the need to put in an lwsync & 
isync.  But I would point out that neither is necessary to actually atomic add 
unless.  They are simply so cmpxchg can be overloaded to be used as both a lock 
and unlock primitive.  If atomic_add_unless isn't being used as a locking 
primitive somewhere I would love for these to be dropped.

This is just personal preference, but I find it more readable to use the 
simplified mnemonic:
cmpw %0, %4

> +	add	%1,%3,%0 \n"
Why use a separate register here? Why not reuse %0 instead of using %1? 
Registers are valuable.
