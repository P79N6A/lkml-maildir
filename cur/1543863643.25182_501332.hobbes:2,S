Well, do you have ECC memory? If not, it is at least possible that  
that the solar flares that occurred last month may have affected your  
system. There were three X-class solar flares in the month of  
December. Even if you have ECC memory, it is still possible to suffer  
data corruption because many BIOSes do not turn on bus parity error  
detection. And are the memories in your disk drive controllers ECC or  
parity protected? I wouldn't bet on it...
All too often, modern PCs are data corruption accidents waiting to  
happen.
