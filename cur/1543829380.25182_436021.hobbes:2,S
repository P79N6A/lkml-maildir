Here are the two patches that fix the suspend issue and the USB oops
issue in your current tree.
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:

The full patches will be sent to the linux-kernel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
