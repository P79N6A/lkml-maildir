your patch might break devices where this value is chosen on purpose, so
it is not acceptable and must be done with a quirk. Another reason is
that I don't allow any stupid vendor specific workarounds inside the
Bluetooth core unless they are implemented as quirks. The core has no
vendor information at all.
