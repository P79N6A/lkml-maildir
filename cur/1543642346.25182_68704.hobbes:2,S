[SNIPPED timer-wrap story]
I tried to simulate your observation by making a driver that
set the 'jiffies' count upon an 'open'. The idea was to get
the jiffies count to something close to wrap so I didn't have to
wait a long time.
Anyway, I found that setting the jiffies count to more than a
few hundred counts into the future, causes the machine to halt
with no interrupts (no Capslock, no NumLock, no network ping, etc).
The machine just stops and I don't understand why. 
	spin_lock_irqsave(&xlock, flags);
        jiffies += 0x1000;
	spin_lock_irqrestore(&xlock, flags);
	... works just fine, but, changing 0x1000 to 0x7fffffff causes
the machine to stop as reported. 
Does anybody have a clue?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
