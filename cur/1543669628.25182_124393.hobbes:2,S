Think again.  In case the "blurp" COULD have "%" in them...

Many of kernel's terse messages do need small encyclopedic articles
to explain them.  Present  gobble-de-gook  can not be made clear by
merely supplying  l10n  translations of them to other gobble-de-gook.
Having ANCIENT STYLE numeric message code references will help users
to find definitive explanations of them.   "My machine said: 
'1-00234-0627 eth0 link down'  and  then it said: '1-00234-0626 eth0 link up'"
(Where initial digit is severity qualifier, then subsystem id, and
finally codepoint within subsystem.  All within 32-bit integer.)
(And probably base64-ish presentation in dmesg buffer, not base10..)
Some tool can produce HTML hyperlinked presentation of the messages
with colour coding telling message classifications as text line backgrounds:
  green:  info/chatty, can ignore
  blue:   something notable happened (like linkstate jumps)
  yellow: something possibly serious
  red:    something definitely serious
at the same time the tool can produce hyperlinks with user's language
preferences (picked from environment/desktop parameters), and point
all that to some site with e.g. a twiki to accumulate documentation.
Vendors could also pull database snapshots into those tools.
That message-code style was introduced, when machines had very little
memory,  but style being in use from the dawn of computing is not
a good reason to shun it.  It really has benefits.

The backslash is not "printk escape".  It is C-string compilation 
notation.
