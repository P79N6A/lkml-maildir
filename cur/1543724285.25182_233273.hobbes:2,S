Greetings,
The following patch, built against linux-2.6.7, includes the driver 
source code, the arch source code (which interacts with firmware and
provides an arch abstracted interface to the driver), and installation
documentation for this driver.
http://www-124.ibm.com/linux/patches/misc/hvcs_to_mainline.diff
This driver implements a virtual console server which provides a tty 
interface for interacting with the virtual consoles of logically
partitioned operating systems on Power-5 hardware from within another
linux partition.  This is required because a physical console adapter
for each partition on a large multi-partition system is impractical.
We would like this patch considered for inclusion into the mainline
2.6 tree.
I'm interested in any comments and critiques.
Thanks,
Ryan S. Arnold
