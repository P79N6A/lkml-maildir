I see that winmodems have reared their ugly head again recently.  We
all know that they don't make much sense under Linux.  Yes, as
*modems* they don't make sense.  However, as a voice telephony
interface, they make a lot of sense (a 25ms delay in responding is
quite reasonable, presuming that the winmodem chip has that much
buffer), and they're quite cheap as such things go (have you priced a
Pika or Dialogic board??)
In my copious spare time I'm consing up some winmodem support at
http://linmodems.org
.
