With ACPI "smart" batteries, we're currently spending long enough on 
querying batteries that people are losing keystrokes. The same is true 
of several crummy APM implementations. On the other hand, I agree that 
it makes sense to leave polling in userspace rather than the kernel. 
Once we go tickless on portable hardware, there's going to be a pretty 
huge incentive to fix userspace in any case.
