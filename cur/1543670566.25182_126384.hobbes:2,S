I just cranked it up, and now I see:

I was confused at first because I was thinking of IRQ balancing as
balancing IRQs *across* CPUs.  This kind of balancing seems to be
about spreading IRQ *sources* across CPUs.  I guess it's good for
caches and whatnot for IRQs to be consistently serviced by the same
CPU.
Anyway, it seems to be working.  Thanks!
