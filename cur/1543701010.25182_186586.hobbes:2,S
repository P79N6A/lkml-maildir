My bad. What I said is true for both LRU and LFU (they try to predict
the probability of future references), but I wrote "frequency" because
that happened to be on my mind (for unrelated reasons). The point was
basically: risk = probability * damage

Agreed. OTOH those readings are consistent with other observations I
made. It should even be possible to add up the reported idle times and
receive a ballpark figure for the slowdown compared to a system with
more than enough memory.

True. If 2.4 reports idle time during a compile benchmark, though, it
seems plausible to assume it is IO wait. And if 2.6 takes much longer
than 2.4 to complete, it is due to time spend waiting for I/O (minus
some difference in system overhead) -- the work done in user space is
equal, after all.

I don't think it's worth it. It wouldn't tell us anything we don't
already know.

Oops, sorry. That trace is a few months old and I forgot I had used a
hack to have timestamps in vmstat. The large numbers that are alternating
are jiffies, the smaller numbers are the actual readings.
