The basic problem is again that some people want to have the privileges of 
GPL without the responsibilities of GPL. That is a very old debate and I
don't think it is sensible to krank it through again. Do GPL work and
you can use the services of the comunity, do non-GPL and you need to 
get these services under other terms. I realy don't see whats so wrong
unfair and evil about this.

The question of derived work is realy exhaustively discused and there are
plenty of statements on this including statements by the FSF itselfe.
mere agregation of work does not put you under any copywrite restrictions,
derived work does - drawing this line is not easy and expecting anybody to
give you "the definitive guide on derived work" is a bit naiv.
You might want to scan the FSF statements on these issues...
