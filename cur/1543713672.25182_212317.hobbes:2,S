Subject: libusb scanner hangs with 2.6.x-mm kernels

Hello,
since 2.6.3-mm4 most of the mm-kernels cause a complete hang of libusb
applications accessing my Epson perfection 1260 scanner.  Disabling
hotplug (i.e. replacing /sbin/hotplug with /bin/true)  solved the
problem on some kernels, on others this made my usb mouse unusable.
Plain vanilla kernels and rc-series work fine.  There has been some
discussion on this topic on the usb-developer's list.  I'm not sure if
this problem is already addressed on the kernel mailing list.
This problem prevents me from using mm-kernels.
