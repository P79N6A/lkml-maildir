Obviously the posted patch doesn't handle the reuse case yet. If you
play with the splice tools and do:
# vmsplice | ktee-net bla port | cat > file
with the vmsplice modified to memset the first half of the buffer after
the second half has been vmspliced, you'll see bad data going out over
the network.
One way that works fine but is hackish is just to monitor the page
count. So don't rely solely on reusing the page once ->release has been
called, but also check buf->page on reuse if the ->release function
hasn't cleared ->page (the page cache ops would, the user_page would
not) so move_to_pipe() can break out appropriately just like if
pipe->nr_buffers was too large. Works, is easily doable, but isn't a
very nice design - it basically works around the problem that
->release() is called too early.
The better way is imho to forget ->sendpage() and do a proper hook that
actually accepts the pipe buffer. Then you don't have to work around
premature release. And hey, it'd be more efficient too. With tee and
friends, you'd want to keep them referenced as well.
This all provided that the method of choice for signalling safe reuse is
still either blocking on vmsplice or using poll() intelligently to do
that.
