This would require quite some magic in set_pte(), as update_mmu_cache() is 
not always called after set_pte(). I'd prefer to keep flush_icache_page() 
for this, there are only a few places, which require this and it doesn't 
hurt to keep this explicit.
BTW it's a bit unfortunate that flush_dcache_page() is called for reads 
and writes. This might be needed for virtual indexed caches, but for 
icache/dcache synchronization I'm only interested in writes (so that 
write()/exec() works, but not every read() causes a cache flush). Could we 
split that interface?
bye, Roman
