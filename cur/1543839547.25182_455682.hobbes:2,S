In general I don't think it makes sense to submit stuff for 2.4 
that isn't in 2.6.

It's not only insufficient on SMP, but even on UP where a thread
can sleep in get_user and another one can run in this time.
Doing a check that is inherently racy everywhere doesn't seem like
a security improvement to me. If there is really a length checking bug somewhere 
it needs to be fixed in a race-free way. If not then there is no need
for a change.
