Back in June of 2001, Pat Mochel and I talked with Richard about this
whole driver model, sysfs, and udev design at the 2001 kernel summit,
after presenting it to all of the other kernel developers.  He had some
objections, but was very aware of what we wanted to do.
It's not like udev and this whole sysfs / driver model implementation
snuck into the kernel late at night when no one else was looking, and
pounced on all of the poor, unsuspecting devfs users, eating them for a
early morning snack.
