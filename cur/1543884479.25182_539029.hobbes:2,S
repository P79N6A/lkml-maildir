I have a 486 with a Mach64 in it running 2.6.18, so well, it just might
happen you know.  I do tend to run it plain 80x25 at the moment, but
that is mainly because it is just doing firewall duties.  I never was
very impressed by the mach64 fb driver when I played with it years ago,
and vesa isn't an option on that card (needed a DOS TSR to do that).
Not sure if that card is covered by any of the chip specific code.
So what is wrong with a 15 year old machine when it has 48MB ram and
18GB disk space?
