<sigh> Nice men of straw there. I note you properly demolished them.

The point is that WITH a debugger you have to take that step as well.
A person without the self discipline to do that is still a child and should
not be in this business. The debugger gives you a better picture of what
is actually happening. If that leverage is considered to be a bad thing
I am surprised and dismayed. A bloody LOT of personal experience 
and technological bloody noses suggests it is a very good thing.

Is somebody saying that a debugger is the key to heaven? I certainly
am not. It is the platform at the top of the ladder that holds your paint
bucket so that you don't have to climb up and down the ladder of your
understanding quite so often. It also beats you over the head with
facts when your head has it wrong. And I must admit that is a painful
hit direct to the ego. {^_-}

And I am an older bitch and proud of it. I've whupped bigger boys than
you.
{^,-}    At least I ended on some humor.
    (And I even arranged that you only see the list copy reducing
    your email inundation by one. Er, why's the list setup without
    a reply-to the list?)
