Hi,
I am researching now about the Linux kernel memory on 64-bit (x86_64) 
machines. I am looking into answering the following questions:
1. Is there a user-kernel split on 64-bit memories? If so, how is it 
done? What is the size of each part?
2. Does kernel high memory exists on 64-bit machines?
3. How is it possible to detect in runtime the split and the size of the 
physical memory?
Thanks,
Yoav
