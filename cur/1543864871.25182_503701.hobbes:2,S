I haven't actually taken any from him. I just started afresh.

Yeah, I fiddled around with those powerpc headers a bit until it stopped
whining. Maybe the powerpc folks ought to eyeball it a bit, but it build
a kernel image here.

Whatever people want; inlines are generally preferred due to the extra
type checking.
I just needed atomic_long_cmpxchg to work so I kicked your patches about
till they compiled.

Yes. Something fishy going on there... gcc-4.1.1 + binutils-2.17
Compiler seems to build fine, but kernel code makes it go belly up.
