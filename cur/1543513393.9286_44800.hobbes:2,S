well, there could be at least one valid reason, ptrace(). If you want to
make one particular kernel daemon strace-able then the entry trap could be
used. I dont know wether it actually works (looks like raceland), but that
could be one reason. exec_modprobe is executed by a kernel thread (kmod),
so it can be argued that it's a special case.
