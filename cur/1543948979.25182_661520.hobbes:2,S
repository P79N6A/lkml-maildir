Strange.  I guess as a first step it would be good if you can get a full
backtrace - can you set up netconsole
(Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt) and grab that?
We have your config.  Can you tell us how you're triggering it?  Does a
particular workload have to be run, or is it triggerable straight after
bootup?
Thanks.
