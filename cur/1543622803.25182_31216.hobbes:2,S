Hello group.
First time poster. If this isn't the right place for this then please point
me in the right direction and accept my apology.
I'm using Linux 2.4.12 on a PIII
I've been playing with sendfile and noticed that it doesn't like 64 bit
filesystems ( _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64). Is there a patch or kernel revision out
there that supports LFS for sendfile?  Or is there some method I can't see
to work around this.
I'm opening a descriptor on a disk partition. I don't need to support
individual block transfers larger than 2 Gig., but would like to serve up
partitions that are larger than 2Gig.
Thanks in advance
Doug
