Since the structure in question isn't explicitly referenced from
elsewhere, the compiler may feel free to omit it. Since we want the
compiler to emit it, not omit it, we use "unused" to say "yes, I know it
looks unused; please emit it anyway". Later compilers use "used" to say
"I use it really; please emit it anyway", meaning much the same thing.
Or something like that.
