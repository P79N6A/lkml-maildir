This is a lot of added code and complexity that does nothing. In
8K stack mode without IRQ stacks you already can only safely use 4K.
So any code that is broken in 4K stack mode is broken in the current
8K stack mode although it'll fail less often since the failure will
depend upon random IRQ/other timings.
8K + IRQ stacks is just making the stacks bigger (which is expensive)
and stressing the vm more. Fix the broken code instead, or just stop
supporting gcc 2.9x which will fix most of it for you
