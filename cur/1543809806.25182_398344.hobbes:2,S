i have lots of IDE based systems (they dont use PIO though) and i'm not 
seeing these. I'll oppose such a patch if it's to hide genuine issues - 
the 10 seconds tolerance is already generous i think. I'll of course fix 
any false positives which are the fault of the softlockup-watchdog, but 
from your mails it appears to me that the IDE warnings are indeed 
genuine.
If the source of the delay is hard to fix you can temporarily work it 
around in the code by putting in the touch_softlockup_watchdog() lines - 
that will also document the places that cause long delays - which is a 
good thing.
It is entirely feasible to put a touch_softlockup_watchdog() call into 
every PIO OP - even a single-byte PIO related IN/OUT instruction takes a 
couple of microseconds, so a touch_softlockup_watchdog() wont even show 
up on the radar.

well, 10+ seconds delays on a running system are not really acceptable, 
and can cause other problems. The softlockup-watchdog is optional and 
can be easily turned off in the .config.
