I agree.
This stupid argument of "HAL is part of the kernel, so we can break it" is 
_bogus_. 
The fact is, if changing the kernel breaks user-space, it's a regression. 
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER IT'S IN /sbin/hotplug OR ANYTHING ELSE. If it 
was installed by a distribution, it's user-space. If it got installed by 
"vmlinux", it's the kernel.
The only piece of user-space code we ship with the kernel is the system 
call trampoline etc that the kernel sets up. THOSE interfaces we can 
really change, because it changes with the kernel.
