I didn't think the PPC camp was actually united on this one.  I got
the impression that it was me vs. the rest of the world. :-)
(I exaggerate.  Alan Cox said that not reordering was a safer default
(which is essentially my position) and Dave Miller said to me in
private email something along the lines that any sane architecture has
a side-effect bit in the PTEs to prevent reordering of accesses to
certain pages.)

Richard Henderson mentioned four drivers which he uses which deal with
this: ncr, aic7xxx, tulip, epic100.  How many others would there be in
this category?  It sounds to me like the vast majority of drivers
which use readl/writel would be assuming that they prevent reordering.
My position is that readl/writel should prevent reordering (of the
accesses generated by read*/write*), and that we should have variants,
maybe called readl_fast etc., for the cases where performance is
crucial and the driver writer is willing to put in explicit barriers
where necessary.
IMHO the time spent doing readl/writel is absolutely insignificant in
the vast majority of cases.  If you have to feed a device so fast that
the time spent doing readl/writel is significant, then you should
either be using DMA (or for a framebuffer, a graphics engine) or you
should be feeding it from user level (as in the case of a 3D graphics
card).
Interestingly, the 4 drivers mentioned by Richard all do DMA (AFAIK).
Which leads me to wonder why the speed of readl/writel is so
significant that it is necessary to have the barriers explicit in the
driver instead of including them in readl/writel.  Surely those
drivers can't be doing more than a couple of readl/writel per packet
or block?

Paul.
