Hiding? These are lists _dedicated_ to the matter.

Sending spam to millions of people increases the chances than someone
will buy your product. Does it make spam a good thing?

Lot of noise, yes. Counting 1 second on average to process posts you're
not interested in, that's 33 hours a year. This is completely insane
and that's why I unsubscribed from LKML long ago. And the situation is
only getting worse every year. You may fail to realize the problem just
because you aren't completely human ;)

Quite on the contrary, I am trying to educate people into targeting
their posts to the right lists so that they get more appropriate
responses in a shorter time.
In a world where we would have infinite work power and time would grow
on trees, I would be fine with everyone sending everything to every
mailing list. But in the real world, time spent to do one thing isn't
spent on another. If we don't learn, collectively, to target our posts
to the right people, then we end up wasting a significant amount of our
precious time.

My comment is general and absolutely not targeted at Bryan personally.
I thought it was clear. I fully agree that Bryan is a really pleasant
and easy person to work with and I do appreciate his contributions.
