OK, I had to think about this for a good, long time.  That's bad. :)
There are two things that we're dealing with here: "active regions" and
the NODE_DATA's.  The if() you've pasted above resizes the reservation
so that it fits into the current active region.  However, as you noted,
we haven't resized it so that it fits into the NODE_DATA() that we're
looking at.  We call into the bootmem code, and BUG_ON().
The thing I don't like about this is that it might hide bugs in other
callers.  This really is a ppc-specific thing and, although what you
wrote will fix the bug on ppc, it will probably cause someone in the
future to call reserve_bootmem_node() with too large a reservation and
get a silent failure (not reserving the requested size) back.  
We really do need to go take a hard look at the whole interaction
between lmb's, node active regions, and the NUMA code some day.  It has
kinda grown to be a bit ungainly.
How about we just consult the NODE_DATA() in
mark_reserved_regions_for_nid() instead of reserve_bootmem_node()?
