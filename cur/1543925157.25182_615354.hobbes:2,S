OK, first show us (that is, the mailing list "linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org", not
just me) what your "kernel-build-script" looks like.
The beginning of the log files that you sent to me (at end of this email)
is very suspicious looking.  It looks like you are not using the expect kernel
build procedures.
The crash problem (snippet below) is a fault in xor_sse_2() in the function
that tries to choose the best (fastest) xor method.  I would expect other
people to be having a similar problem.  I don't suspect that it's related to
the build problem (Makefile.o), but we need to have you building kernels
correctly before we try to find out why they break when you boot them.
