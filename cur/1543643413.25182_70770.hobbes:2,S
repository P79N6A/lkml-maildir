Hi Linus,
   please apply this. 
Fixes endless loop without schedule which happens as soon as smbd 
invokes fcntl64(7, F_SETLK64, ...). fcntl_setlk64 gets cmd F_SETLK64,
not F_SETLK tested in the loop;
Maybe return value from posix_lock_file should be changed to -EINPROGRESS 
or -EJUKEBOX instead of testing passed cmd in callers, but this oneliner 
works too. If you preffer changing posix_lock_file return value to clearly 
distinugish between -EAGAIN and lock request queued, I'll do that.
