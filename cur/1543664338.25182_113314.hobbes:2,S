| A sorted list of bad stack users (more than 256 bytes) in my default build
| follows. Anybody can create their own with something like
| 
| 	objdump -d linux/vmlinux |
| 		grep 'sub.*$0x...,.*esp' |
| 		awk '{ print $9,$1 }' |
| 		sort > bigstack
| 
| and a script to look up the addresses.
| 
| That ide_unregister() thing uses up >2kB in just one call! And there are 
| several in the 1.5kB range too, with a long list of ~500 byte offenders.
| 
| Yeah, and this assumes we don't have alloca() users or other dynamic 
| stack allocators (non-constant-size automatic arrays). I hope we don't 
| have that kind of crap anywhere..
Keith Owens did such a script over 1 year ago.  It's available from
  
http://kernelnewbies.org/scripts/check-stack.sh
It also identifies (flags) dynamic stack allocation.
(course, I can't read Keith's as well as I can Linus's)
