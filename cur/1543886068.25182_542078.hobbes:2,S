A few questions:
Does try_to_freeze()'s kerneldoc document that try_to_freeze() is a
no-op sometimes but should nevertheless be called for this and that
reason?  (I don't know the entire patch series.)
Why add no-op-try_to_freeze() everywhere now, instead of adding it later
when it will actually be needed?  (I.e. "in the future".)
Can we please have a future where no device driver has to care if and
when and how to freeze its threads?
