Check linux-mm: zero-copy splice is broken anyway, and AFAIKS it cannot
really be fixed to work with the current prepare_write.

Actually we could do it with begin_write. All we need to do is set a
flag to say that *pagep contains a page that we can use, with a copy of
the write data on it.
The filesystem would then be able to insert that page into the pagecache
*if* it could handle such an operation.
OTOH, is splice stealing support really important? I guess it could be a
nice win for a small niche of workloads, and we probably don't want to
exclude it by design...
