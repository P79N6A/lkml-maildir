That sounds scary. 
If you want your handler to be SA_NODELAY then you did this for a
reason. Simply refuse to share if the other device requests the
interrupt without SA_NODELAY.
A real solution for that problem needs more thought and the only thing
which comes to my mind is to have split handler functionality, which
allows to implement real cascaded interrupts. The short first stub would
just query, mask/ack the interrupt in the device and return the
appropriate information, so the real handler can be invoked at any given
time.
I know it would be a large pile of hacking, but it would be a clean
solution. OTOH it might be done gradually on a per driver base once the
basic infrastucture is in place.
