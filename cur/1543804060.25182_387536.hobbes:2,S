Yes. They'll give us a better oops if they pick up something.

Indeed that's because the kernel starts reclaiming memory and attempts to 
shrink the slabs. It's just that the page we're freeing is being managed 
by the slab allocator and I don't see how anyone else could be messing 
around with it. The fact that it's one bit error makes me think it could 
be due to faulty memory.
