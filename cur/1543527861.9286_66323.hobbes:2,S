Given that the System V Abi for the PowerPC (on page 6-38, figure 6-39)
mandates that size_t be an unsigned int, it is not terribly surprising.  Of
course considering that the committee that came up with the System V ABI is
long since dead, it is kind of hard to change for 32-bit land (obviously 64 bit
land will have an different ABI).
