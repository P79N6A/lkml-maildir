Subject: Kernel Panic with 2.4.0-test12 when using iso9660 over nfs

If I mount a cdrom over NFS with 2.4.0-test12 on the NFS-Server, the server
crashs. In the log-files are no Information. On the screen comes the following:
Code: 89 42 04 89 10 b8 01 00 00 c7 43 04 00 00 00 c 03 00
Aieee, killing interupt handler
Unable to handle kernel Null pointer deveference at virtural address 0000029e.
It crashs only with 2.4.0-test12 with 2.4.0-test10 it doesn't (with 
2.4.0-test11 I cannot use cdroms at all). 
I have an Alladin V chipset and a IDE-CDROM.
