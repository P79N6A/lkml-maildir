The S/390 DASD driver could conceivably make use of generic block layer
(or higher-up) multi-path support.
(We have multi-path support on a lower level, the channel subsystem,
but this helps only with reliability / failover.  Using multi-path
support on a higher level for performance reasons would be helpful
in certain scenarios.)
