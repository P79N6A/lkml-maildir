Yes, iproute2 rocks!
I recently discovered that it can do "xfrm" stuff and was amazed to
see that the developer(s) had a big clue about what we like to
see (and what is human readable), if we type "ip xfrm state" 
and "ip xfrm policy" as opposed to "setkey -D" and "setkey -PD".
So I can only hope that netlink and iproute will be chosen as a way
to represent it to the user, just because of the clueful developers of
iproute2.
