Danger Will Robinson: panic notification to modules is racy.
Registering via panic_notifier_list does not bump the module use count,
a panic can occur while a module is being unloaded and you are dead.
No big deal for panic, you are already dying, but it is just a symptom
of a larger problem, yet another uncounted reference to module code.
_ANY_ notifier callback to a module is racy, think very carefully
before exporting any XXX_notifier_list.
I would go so far as to say that no XXX_notifier_list should be
exported, that includes notifier_chain_register() itself.  If a module
needs to be notified then it should have glue code in the main kernel
that does try_inc_mod_count() on the module before calling any module
functions.
