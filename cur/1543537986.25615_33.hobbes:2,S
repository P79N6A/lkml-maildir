Rik as far as I understand english was complaining something I did
claiming I caused loss of stability (in the contect of the buf-flushing
patch, but I wasn't sure he was talking about that patch). So I asked
which code caused the loss of stability to understand if he was talking
about the buf-flushing patch or not, and you replyed saying that you added
wait_on_buffer() in try_to_free_buffers() and the MAP_SHARED problem is
been hided by this trick. I thank you for the reminder about your change
and I apologise if I'm not been clear in my question but I'm still waiting
an answer about what caused the loss of stability. Rik, was you talking
about the buf-flushing patch or about something else? Do you feel that
it's too complicated or messy? Note that I have not proposed it for
inclusion even if I consider more correct than the current code.
