It's on the larger machines where 2.4 has problems.  Fixing them up
makes the kernel broader, more general purpose.  We're seeing 50-100%
gains in some areas there.  Giving away a few percent on smaller machines
at this stage is OK.  But yup, we need to go and get that back later.

Prefer not to.  We've been able to cover all bases moderately well
thus far without adding a big boolean switch.

The main thing we can do for smaller systems is to not allocate as much
memory at boot time.  Some more careful scaling is needed there.  I'll
generate a list soon.
