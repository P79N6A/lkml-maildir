The (admittedly limited) documentation [1] I have for the S2875 states
that only 3 of the 6 fan headers have their tachometer pin wired. This
matches the W83627HF hardware monitoring chip capabilities, which is why
I see no evidence of any kind of multiplexing on that board.

Not all SMBus clients are hardware monitoring chips. The fact that
sensors-detect didn't recognize it would even suggest that your unknown
chip isn't. What you see may be about anything, including
pseudo-clients used for the SMBus protocol itself.
Feel free to submit a dump (using i2cdump) of that unknown chip if you
want me to comment on it.
As a side note, Tyan actually has a long history of embedding more than
one hardware monitoring chip in their high-end server boards. This makes
full sense when the board has plenty of fan headers and supports several
CPU. The S4882 for example has 6 hardware monitoring chips, and this is
one reason why the SMBus had to be multiplexed (4 of these chips use the
same address).
