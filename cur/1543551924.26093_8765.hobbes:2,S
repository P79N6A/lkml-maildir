Hi!
The isapnp change in 2.4.0-test10-pre beaks the detection of
my non-pnp soundblaster AWE32 card (compiled into the kernel,
as modular operation oopses - see mail with Subject:sound related OOPS
(2.4.0-test9-pre7) from Sun, 1 Oct 2000 15:49:46). The kernel
hangs after printing the message
sb: No ISAPnP cards found...
in working kernels after that the sb card with io/irq/etc. is printed.
There are no sound changes in the 2.4.0-test10-pre patchset, so
I highly suspect the isapnp-change - configuring isapnp out
gives a working system again. (note that isapnp is modular in my
system, used for an isapnp ne2000 clone).
Richard.
