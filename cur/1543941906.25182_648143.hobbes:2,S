I guess I'm worried that the hooks that you add here will not be usable
by speakup, and we'll have to add more in places close to this, but not
quite the same.
I know speaking and "showing" are two different things, but they both
require the same data flow going into them in order to achieve their
goals, I just don't want to see this work being done without considering
both needs.
But, if you feel that both will work properly with these limited
exports, I have no objections.
