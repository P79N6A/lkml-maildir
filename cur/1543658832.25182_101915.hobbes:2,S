Strange, I'm doing the very same thing (not with NICs though) using the
local_irq_desc
at the driver level or via /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity method and both work fine.
2.4.18 and 2.4.20 both work here but haven't actually used 2.4.19.

My userland app doesn't know the difference and works fine whether HT or not.
At least according to /proc/interrupts, xosview, and the actual performance of
my app.
