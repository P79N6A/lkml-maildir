Hi,

2.4.18, usb-uhci
  does start to print, but the whole machine freezes a page or two
  later (Alt-SysRq works). This was also the reason I chose uhci
  some versions ago.
2.4.19-pre5, uhci
  does not work. It appeared start to print (sucked the paper in),
  but that was it
2.4.19-pre5, usb-uhci
  the machine does not even come up, the modprobe usb-uhci in the
  boot scripts freezes
Regards
