I spoke to Eric earlier today.  (We're co-doing a presenatation at LinuxWorld 
Expo on thursday.)
His take on it was that he understood that Configure.help needed to be split 
up, but since the file was used by CML1 and he was NOT the CML1 maintainer, 
he didn't believe he had the authority to unilaterally change the file format 
in a way that would seriously break CML1.  (And, as it happens, now that the 
change has gone in, it seems the existing configurators are currently broken 
and have no help.)
Considering how much he's been warned so far about the need for CML2 to 
maintain as much compatability as possible with CML1, change as little 
behavior as possible in its first version, and not to make intrustive changes 
into the rest of the codebase...  I think he expected to be flamed alive if 
he broke up the help file before CML2 went in.
I.E. There was a miscommunication.  (The drop from Linus was an actual 
reject, but without an explanation of why it was rejected the reject didn't 
get resolved.  For 33 consecutive versions...)
