I have cardbus and a glidepoint (/dev/psaux) and I have no lockups -except-
30% of the time when i eject/install my aironet.  If I eject the aironet
inside X, i have an immediate and full lockup all the time.  If I eject at
console, it works 60% of the time, refuses to reload (requiring power off
reboot) about 5% of the time and locks up the rest.
Prior to the aironet I had a netgear 10/100/56K cardbus and it works like
above.  Works most of the time, oopses some of the time.
The laptop is an NEC Versa LX, kernel 2.3.X where X is generally current. 
More details available if desired.
