Hi Rafael,
I looked at the patch and noticed that it's changing a file inside 
linux-2.6.12-rc6/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c
So, basically, it's modifying the powernow driver in the i386 arch 
directory, but shouldn't that file be in "arch/x86_64/....", or am I missing 
something?  I'm compiling the kernel for x86_64, so will my 64 bit kernel 
use this file even though it's in the i386 directory?
Thanks,
Jon
