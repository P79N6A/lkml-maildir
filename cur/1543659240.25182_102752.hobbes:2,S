Well, AFS also wants Kerb [but a weird Kerb4 variant IIRC], but,
OTOH why not do all this authentication and stuff in userspace?
Several other projects through the years have done similar things, where
a userspace daemon handles auth and such, and then passes an fd into
the kernel via ioctl [or write(2)ing fd value to a mini-ramfs VFS node].
