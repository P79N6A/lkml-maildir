And as one of the maintainers of an architecture where this is true
(neither atomic.h nor bitops.h will work in userspace atomically) I
whole heartedly agree that the kernel's atomic operations must not
be exported to userspace via header files.
Anyone who thinks they will or should do is just kidding themselves.
The final point to add to this is that folk might be lucky, and the
kernel's atomic ops might _appear_ to work without raising any faults,
but that does _not_ mean that they are necessarily atomic in their
operation.  For example:
	unsigned long *a;
	a[bit >> 5] |= 1 << (bit & 31);
and
	set_bit(bit, &a);
are 100% equivalent in userspace if you use the kernel's asm-arm/bitops.h.
Neither will be atomic.  More importantly, _neither_ could be made to be
atomic.
