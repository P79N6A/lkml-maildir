On x86, an unsigned long holds 32 bit, so we can at most put 32 flags in a 
'flags' argument, even on x64 -- to stay compatible/deterministic/you know.
So it sounds like a good thing to make it 'unsigned int' rather than 
'unsigned long'. Saves stack space.

It's not (out,in) everywhere. But there are also other extremes, like
outb() where (val,port) is rather confusing compared to the rest of the 
world (port,val).
