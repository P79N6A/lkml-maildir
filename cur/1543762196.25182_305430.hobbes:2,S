Martin Mares used to maintain pci.ids list in v2.4, last update was long ago: 
ChangeSet@1.555.44.112, 2002-08-14 18:34:28-03:00, mj@ucw.cz
  [PATCH] pci.ids for 2.4.20-pre2
  Hi Marcelo,
  After a long sleep, I'm sending another batch of PCI ID's. These include
  entries accumulated sent to me in past few months and also ID's having
  appeared in 2.5.x.
I dont have a problem with pci.ids additions given there is a demand 
for it.
