I guess I need to rewrite that comment. It shouldn't appear infinitely
looping, since it is basically: do { x=A; func() } while (x != A); which
to me seems that while is most likely to fail unless something touches A.
But yes, it _is_ basically a seq lock, but its on what we are working
with.  And we don't even need any memory barriers that a seq lock might
do, since it is very obvious to gcc that the function call can modify the
variables that we are testing.
But do you still think that looks inifinte?  If so, I'll reword it.
