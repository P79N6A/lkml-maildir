The patch I currently have in -mm (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/29/412
)
merely requests resources in pnp_start_dev() and releases them in
pnp_stop_dev().  So if we remove pnp_stop_dev() but keep pnp_start_dev(),
I have to fix that patch to deal with things that may already be
reserved.
But I don't see any mention in the spec of running _SRS in the
sleep/wakup path, so I'm not convinced it's really necessary.
Section 7.4 mentions _TTS, _PTS, _GTS, etc., but not _SRS.
For devices, it looks like the intent is that BIOS should generate
notifications that cause OSPM to re-enumerate devices that might
have changed.  I'm pretty sure Linux is missing some of that code,
though, so I could believe that _SRS might help paper over that
deficiency.
What I'd really like to do is figure out how Windows uses _SRS and
do the same thing.
