Yes.
	1. "cgroup" and "css" object are different object.
	2. css object may not be freed at destroy() (as current memcg does.)
Some of css objects cannot be freed even when there are no tasks because
of reference from some persistent object or temporal refcnt.
Please consider css_under_removal() as a kind of css_tryget() which doesn't
increase any refcnt.
