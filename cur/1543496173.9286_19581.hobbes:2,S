Actually, I wrote that program and it works pretty well (see
http://www.goop.org/~jeremy/caps
).  It is more subtle than you're making out
though.  The notes can go anywhere, but you have to expand the PHDR table to
refer to it - and the PHDRs are mapped into the process address space.
I also agree with both of you (Richard & Linus).  I think putting the caps into
the ELF header is an interesting hack to experiment with capabilities, but not
the way to go in the long term.  That's why I've pushed so hard to keep caps in
an ELF note rather than in some more pervasive ELF format change.
