Nod.  Maybe it helps Marc to point out the key difference between 
characters and bytes, in UTF8.
In UTF8, the number of characters in a string is less-than-or-equal-to 
the number of bytes in the string.
And the kernel just cares about bytes.
This is the whole benefit to UTF8, right here in this thread.  UTF8 was 
designed such that ten-year-old C code using standard C strings would 
function just fine.  No need to rip up large swaths of your code just to 
call multi-byte versions of the standard string functions.  Most code 
that doesn't deal with locale-specific details like uppercase/lowercase 
Just Works(tm).
