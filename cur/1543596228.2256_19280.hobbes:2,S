kmap_high is intended to be called routinely for access to highmem
pages.  It is coded to be as fast as possible as a result.  TLB
flushes are expensive, especially on SMP, so kmap_high tries hard to
avoid unnecessary flushes.
The way it does it is to do only a single, complete TLB flush of the
whole kmap VA range once every time the kmap address ring cycles.
That's what flush_all_zero_pkmaps() does --- it evicts old, unused
kmap mappings and flushes the whole TLB range, so that we are
guaranteed that there is a TLB flush between any two different uses of
any given kmap virtual address.
That way, we can avoid the cost of having to flush the TLB for every
single kmap mapping we create.
Cheers,
 Stephen
