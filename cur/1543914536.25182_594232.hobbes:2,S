Above needs to use Signed-off-by: if you want this merged.

There was reportedly a discussion about sample source code in the
Documentation/ directory at the kernel summit.  Some people want to
move it to the util-linux package.  If that's not done, I strongly
prefer that Makefiles and source files be put into their own
sub-directory, not "hidden" inside txt files, so you would end up
with something line Documentation/trace/, with trace.txt, and also
Documentation/trace/src, with Makefile and fork_trace.c & any other
source files.
+Trace is adapted from blktrace authored by Jens Axboe (axboe@suse.de).

Ditto.

Use just one blank line between functions and/or structs.
Please check the patch with scripts/checkpatch.pl and then evaluate
its warnings.  Sometimes it makes sense to ignore some of them.

Thanks for using kernel-doc; however, don't put a blank line between
the function name line and the parameters.  Also, the function
name line should have a "-" separating the function name and the
short description.  (multiple places in trace.c)
