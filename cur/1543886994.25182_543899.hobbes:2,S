Yes, but they might show up in the future. My point was that we know of
scenarios that will break this, so it won't be a universal solution (even though
it might work right now).

That would be a cleaner solution yes. That way we don't exploit any current
behaviour that might change in the future.

All the ones I have on my desk right now use initrd. ;)

Of course I see it as an issue. My concern is if we gain more than we lose.
I had a chat with David Woodhouse and Segher Boessenkool and I think we have
another approach. Basically, we move the waiting which would normally go into
the initrd and move it into the kernel. So you get something like:
"Waiting for root device /dev/mmcblk0p1..."
The only problem here is if the device never shows up, but if that was the case
you would previously get a panic, so it should not be any worse.
Does that sound like something that would work for you? From my point of view
it's a much cleaner solution that has the benefit of not being tied into a
certain subsystem (i.e. this would "fix" usb aswell).
