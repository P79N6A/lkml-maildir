well, yes and no, actually all those funny 'mount' options
provided by the kernel 'on the fly' are just bits which
get set (or cleared) after 'parsing' the mount options
at mount time ...
this means:
 - bad mount option, no mount
 - ignored mount option, no flag
 - known mount option, flag is set (or cleared)
of course it would be possible to 'extend' the kernel
by some 'important' flags which are _not_ used by the
kernel itself ...
