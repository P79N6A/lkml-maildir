If you do this (and I've seen the results of doing both at once vs only
either of then vs pure) then there's NO benifit for the preemption left.
Sure AVERAGE latency goes down slightly, however this is talking in the usec
range since worst case is already 1msec or less. Below the 1msec range it
really doesn't matter anymore however. 
At that point you're adding all the complexity for the negliable-to-no-gain
case...
