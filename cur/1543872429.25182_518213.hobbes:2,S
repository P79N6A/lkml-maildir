 Hello,
  I periodically see the following TCP kernel assertion errors in 
/var/log/message
  (it does seem that networking is eventually able to recover from these 
errors):
  kernel: KERNEL: assertion (flags & MSG_PEEK) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c 
(1171)
  kernel: KERNEL: assertion (flags & MSG_PEEK) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c 
(1171)
  kernel: KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt || (flags & 
(MSG_PEEK | MSG_TRUNC))) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1235)
  kernel: KERNEL: assertion (flags & MSG_PEEK) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c 
(1171)
  kernel: KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt || (flags & 
(MSG_PEEK | MSG_TRUNC))) failed at net/ipv4/tcp.c (1235)
  These errors only seem to occur when using the sk98lin (SysKonnect) 
Network Device Driver,
  and a Yukon Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Adapter (from Marvell I 
believe).
 (The other NIC cards we're using in-house don't exhibit this issue).
 I've seen postings concerning this issue over the past year or so,
  but have not seen a clear resolution and/or understanding of the 
root-cause of this issue.
  I'm in the process of upgrading my sk98lin network driver to the 
latest from SysKonnect
 in an attempt to see if this corrects the problem.
 Does anybody have any insight into this problem?
 Best regards,
 Dave F
