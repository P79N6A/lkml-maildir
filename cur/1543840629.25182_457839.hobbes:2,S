I think that we are trying to protect against :
  1) local users faking kernel messages. (eg: disk errors, oopses, ...)
  2) local users changing console settings (eg: black on black)
  3) local users corrupting the log reader's terminal
1) is relatively easy to do, basically if we escape \b, \r and \n, it will
become hard to produce fake logs.
2) should be as easy. I'm not aware of any way to change a local console
setting with non-control chars (>= 0x20)
3) is a problem of interpretation between the program storing the logs on
disk and the one retrieving them and showing them to the user. It's by no
way a kernel problem.
Thus, 1 and 2 could be merged by escaping chars \x00 to \x1F. Sysklogd
prints them as control chars prefixed with the '^' sign, so a linefeed
would appear as '^J'.

I don't think we will have to escape the escape char itself. I know that
this is dirty and will not make it reliable to reverse the string, but
we need to keep in mind that what we are trying to do is not preventing
users from hiding their programs' exact names, but preventing them from
faking logs. Moreover, sysklogd does not escape the escape char either,
so we are not introducing a new weakness by doing this.
Also, we should not prevent the kernel from outputting such chars. For
instance, RAMDISK decompression displays a rotating bar followed by
backspaces (doing dmesg on a serial console on this is somewhat funny).
Such strings are hard-coded, so as long as we only protect the %s interpreter,
we will not break those legitimate uses.

I will try to propose something this week-end.
