I tried to further clean up the i386 trampoline code, and I found 2
weird lines:
1) the decompressor (arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S) checks if it is
called by the trampoline code.
AFAICS, this can never happen: the decompressor decompresses the kernel
on the first cpu, and then these functions are overwritten.
the "ljmpl KERNEL_CS,0x0100000" in arch/i386/kernel/trampoline.S always
jumps to "startup_32", never to "startup_32" 8)
ie always to the function in in arch/i386/kernel/head.S, never the
function in arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S.
2) arch/i386/kernel/head.S enables the 4 MB page tables twice:
around line 65, the secondary cpu loads the cr4 value from the primary
cpu, and around line 220 it unconditionally enables 4 MB page tables.
AFAICS, the second asm block is completely superflous.
A patch is attached (tested with lilo and bzImage)
