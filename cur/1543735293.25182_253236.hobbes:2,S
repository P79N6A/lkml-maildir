How many of the races matter. There seem to be several different
problems here and mixing them up might be a mistake. 
1.	I absolutely need to get the right file at the right moment, please
mass me a descriptor to the file as the user closes it so I always get
it right (indexer, virus checker)
2.	If something happens bug me and I'll have a look (eg file manager)
Also it varies between "This file" and "everything in this subtree".
An indexer for example really wants to know "this file, this path" for
entire subtrees and to index the right object (if the path changes thats
less of an issue).
