I didn't see any new ones when I looked for METHOD_NAME__CRS.

You're right, this was broken.  But I've been pushing a PNPACPI
patch to fix this.

Yeah, I did that, and it was a huge mistake.  The point was to avoid
blind probing for the device, but my concern was for ia64, and no ia64
boxes have floppy, so it's much easier to just not build the driver.

If you mean the last paragraph of section 6, I don't really understand
it.  But it mentions 8250_acpi.c as an obstacle, and I do know that we
are very close to being able to remove that.  I've already posted two
patches (one to PNPACPI to fix the 64-bit address problem, and one to
8250_pnp to add support for MMIO UARTs).  Once those are accepted, we
should be able to remove 8250_acpi.c.  I think only ia64 really relies
on it anyway.

I'm afraid I don't know anything about this one.
