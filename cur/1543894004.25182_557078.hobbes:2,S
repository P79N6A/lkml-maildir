No.  The FSF actually does *not* want to take this position.  That's
why it chose the formulation of Installation Instructions.  It doesn't
share my view that the keys needed to sign a binary in order for it to
work are part of the source code.

That's the hardware imposing a restriction on modification of the
software.  It doesn't matter how elaborate the excuse is to justify
denying users' freedoms: it's against the spirit of the GPL, and the
GPL will be amended as needed to plug such holes.

That's an interesting argument.
People don't get your copy, so they're not entitled to anything about
it.
When they download the software, they get another copy, and they have
a right to modify that copy.

Agreed, except I'd probably use a lighter term.

Yes.  You see how TiVO is different?  It is modifyable, and I actually
receive the copy that TiVO can still modify, but I can't.

Indeed, it's something bigger.  But this doesn't exclude the smaller
things, does it?

There is a difference.  But the GPL doesn't limit itself to the
former.  It explicitly talks about "copies".
