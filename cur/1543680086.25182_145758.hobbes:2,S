I'm struggling with the 2.4 series for now :)
Haven't tried 2.5.x yet, as it is a production machine.
I'm compiling 2.4.21 with magic sysreq. support now.

Yes, the hangs happen on uniprocessor, non-preemptible kernels.
The smp kernels which don't boot bring up that message, which is solved
by adding acpi=off to the kernel command line, acpismp=force does not
seem vital here.
I will see if I can reproduce the hang and get a trace.
