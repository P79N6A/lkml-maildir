Some form of unexpected shutdown such as power failure.  My laptop had this issue.  I
eventually had to copy the data I had and reformat the drive because I was collecting more and
more bad areas.  Untarring the kernel, cvs checkout of X, etc, etc.  I was left with a growing
number of undeletable trashed directories.
