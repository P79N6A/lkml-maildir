The good reason is that there is no longer any in-kernel user of this 
export, and the kernel does not offer APIs only for external modules.
If there's no in-kernel users that's also a light indication that it 
might not be the correct API to use.
Tell the vendors of the modules using it that they should submit their 
modules for inclusion in the kernel.
