I just tried this patch against the 2.4.17 kernel.  I was able to
completely freeze my D815EEA2 motherboard based computer by trying
to copy a large directory over NFS.  The machine is connected to a
10bt HUB, and this setup has shown lockups before with various
eepro100 drivers.  The e100 seems to work fine in this setup...
An older eepro driver (the one with RH's 2.4.9-13 kernel) does not
lock up the machine, but I do see incessant wait-for-cmd-done-timeout
messages, and the network is basically un-usable.
On other machines, connected to a 100bt-FD switch, the new patch
seems to work just fine, btw.
The eepro lockup is repeatable, so let me know if there is any
information I can get for you that will help.
Thanks,
Ben
