nice.  i proposed something like this 8 or so years ago... the problem is 
that you've also got to deal with socket(2), socketpair(2), accept(2), 
pipe(2), dup(2), dup2(2), fcntl(F_DUPFD)... everything which creates new 
fds.
really what is desired is fork/clone with selective duping of fds.  i.e. 
you supply the list of what will become fd 0,1,2 in the child.
