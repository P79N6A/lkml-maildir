No, it's just obscure.
You have three options for now.  The first is to read the Intel or AMD
CPU performance counter docs, which I don't recommend, because that kind
of thing is never fun.
The second is to build a library called PAPI, which includes a command
called papiex that provides a less intimidating performance counter
interface.  However, building PAPI with a not-quite-the-same version of
perfctr is a bit daunting, so I don't recommend that, either.
Your third option is to build a version of perfex that I've hacked on,
but not had time to finish up and submit to Mikael.  I've attached it as
a tarball.  This includes a man page that makes the usage less scary,
and it also accepts (gasp) textual arguments instead of hex strings.
I've tested it on P6, Pentium M and AMD64 chips.
