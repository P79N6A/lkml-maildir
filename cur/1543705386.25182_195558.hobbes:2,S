Need more info before sending you test patches, please open up a new bug
report and put the info there:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
 Category: Power Management, Component: ACPI
For the same (ACPI enabled) kernel, both with and without "acpi=off",
please attach 
dmesg -s40000 output (or serial console log if dmesg unavailable)
/proc/interrupts
If you can run the latest release, and clarify which release this last
worked properly in, that would be helpful.
Also, please attach the output from acpidmp, available in /usr/sbin/, or
in pmtools:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
Please attach the output from dmidecode, available in /usr/sbin/, or
here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
and attach a copy of your .config
thanks,
-Len
