Greetings:
Looking at the archives I see that this has been brought up in the past a few
times, but no one ever replied or resolved the issue (unless I missed
something).
Problem:  UIDs recorded are typed smaller than the 2.4+ default uid_t size.
Solution:  A two line patch in include/linux/acct.h which casts ac_uid &
ac_gid as uid_t/gid_t instead of __u16.
Now, I have to ask, why hasn't this been done already?  If I submit a patch,
will anyone consider actually applying this?  Or will I have to continue to
munge that file myself (and glibc's sys/acct.h) in order to get my tools to
work they're supposed to?
The sources for kernel 2.6.3 also still list uid/gid fields as __u16, BTW.
