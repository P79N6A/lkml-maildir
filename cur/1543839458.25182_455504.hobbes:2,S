These are Linux specific operations.
Without an _GPL you are in the grey area where courts have to decide 
whether a module using this would be a derived work according to 
copyright law in $country_of_the_court and therefore has to be GPL.
With the _GPL, everything is clear without any lawyers involved.

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
