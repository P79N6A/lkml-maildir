	Don't use his method. The '1's sometimes rotate and get stuck in the wires.
	I have a superior method, patented of course. You use '0' (48) for the zero
bits and 'o' (111) for the one bits. Both of these characters are
sufficiently round to fit through even the narrowest network paths without
jamming.
	I also offer 'royalty-free' licenses.
