} In a 3rd world country a 386 might be all that you can afford.
Even without that constraint, a 386 might be all you *need*.  Using
a 400MHz dual CPU system as a DNS server might theoretically get you
better horsepower/watt, but if 99.7% of it is sitting unused, you're
still wasting money (and actually consuming _more_ power, not less).
