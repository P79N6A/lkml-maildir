Any thoughts on the future of LKM rootkits in the 2.6 kernel branch ? In
the last few years I've become quite interested in them (from a defensive
point of view), but with the 2.6 kernel no longer exporting the syscall
table, intercepting system calls would appear to be a non-starter now. In
a perverse sort of way, i'm actually rather dissapointed: all that
learning gone to waste.
Cheers,
Pete
