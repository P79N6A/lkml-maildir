yup.

After the 17th iteration the fs was 75% full, so at iteration 8
we're at 37%, etc.

Their attempt to put each top-level dir in its own cylinder group
_may_ work with ext2 on pass zero, but it'll come unstuck on passes
one to sixteen.  I've been treating this as basically random fs
activity.   Any conclusions need to verified with Constantin's
test code.

True.  At the end of the run, we end up with 62 directories and
8757 files.  So under
/mountpoint/NN/
we end up with 61 directories and 474 files.  The remainder of the
files are immediately under thos 61 directories.  It's a wide and
shallow layout.
