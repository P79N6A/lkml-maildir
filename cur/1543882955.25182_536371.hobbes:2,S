Yes, I think something is definitely wrong here.  If the code is presently
calling show_registers() with no prototype in scope, it should be emitting
warnings?
Also, yes, kprobes.h is an inappropriate place for this declaration.  It
should be in include/asm-foo/, I guess.
But if we do that, there's an excellent chance of a compile explosion,
because we also have implementations of show_registers() in
drivers/net/wireless/ipw2100.c, drivers/usb/gadget/net2280.c,
drivers/usb/host/ehci-dbg.c, drivers/usb/host/ohci-dbg.c and who knows
where else.
So what I'd suggest is that we rename show_registers() to something saner,
then put the declaration into some arch header file then include that
header in kprobes.
