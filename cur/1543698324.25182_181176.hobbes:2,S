Everything goes through the page cache, including all of your apps.  The
executables are mapped through the page cache, cache is combined with     
executable data.
And you have a kernel patched with the rmap VM.
All numbers are seperate below:

Not sure why Inact_target is in there, but it adds up almost perfect to
memtotal.
These below are within the active/inactive lists:

Remember, that's active.  If it's not active, then it's in the inactive
list.  And it doesn't show inactive_anon memory (because it's not on a
seperate list)

Don't try adding the numbers on stock 2.4, they're just not fully accounted
in /proc/meminfo, but with rmap you can get close.
