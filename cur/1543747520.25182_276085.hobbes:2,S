8.33Mhz. The delays should be correct but given that just about all
hardware under 15 years old doesn't care (I think the last thing to care
was the digital hi-note laptop) it is possible that the new input code
has a tiny missing delay somewhere. Having said that I have specifically
audited the input keyboard driver for such problems in 2.6.5 or so and
found only one (which is fixed)
Nor should the ISA bus speed matter - the uController chugs along at
about 2Mhz and the delays it needs are a bit longer than just ISA
cycles.
