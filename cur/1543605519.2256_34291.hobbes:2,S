Take a look around Apple's site, particularly the developer section. 
There's documentation in spades if you can read PDFs.  Fact, that's 
one of the best things about Apple - they document nearly everything 
in public view.

Come to think of it, the kernel already supports a fair amount of 
video hardware, through framebuffer.  I don't know how capable that 
is, though, beyond displaying and scrolling text in various 
resolutions, and as a place for XFree86 to fall back to.  If fbdev is 
accelerated, some kind of userspace utility and kernel-space cleanup 
would potentially allow fully-accelerated (including 3D?) graphics, 
with much of the hard work in kernel space.  Or is fbdev just a dumb 
framebuffer and I'm totally off track?
