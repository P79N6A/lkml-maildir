Oops, I got the command wrong, it can tell you the block device *and*
the sysfs path if you use the linux.sysfs_path key (which is non
portable key I guess from the name).
But anyway, it just looked at udev and it can do the same:
root@estel 4/home/diego # udevinfo -q path -n /dev/cd-rw
/block/hdc
(IOW: /sys/block/hdc)
