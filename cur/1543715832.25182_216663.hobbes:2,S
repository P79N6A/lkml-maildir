Even that is a violation of the GPL.  You can't link closed-source code 
with GPL code and release it legally.
Binary-only modules are technically a violation of the GPL, but kernel 
developers have chosen to allow it under tight constraints.
But the building and releasing ANYTHING which is made up of GPL code and 
closed-source code and released as an atomic unit (not merely agregated 
on the same medium) is illegal.
