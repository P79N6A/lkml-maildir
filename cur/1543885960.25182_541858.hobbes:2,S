I'm trying to write to disk from a kernel module at high
sustained speeds.
Do I have to somehow query the file-system caches to see how
much memory they are using, or perhaps flush the file after
a certain number of bytes to keep the system from using all
of it's RAM in file-system buffers?
[ Yes, I know this is an evil thing to attempt, and Greg did not
   show me how to do it! :) ]
Thanks,
Ben
