Patches have been floating around for quite some time that implement
soft float with VFP parameter passing conventions (which notably
implies native endianness, unlike FPA).  They all seem to derive from
Nicolas Pitre's patch at
http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/pipermail/linux-arm/2003-October/006436.html
, which is said to have some bugs but to supply the majority of the
needed functionality.  (See, for instance,
http://www.busybox.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/branches/buildroot.mjn3/toolchain/gcc/3.4.6/arm-softfloat.patch.conditional?rev=14854&view=auto.
)
 I assume that I'm not the first to fix it up for gcc 4.1.1.

It would be nice if this appeared prominently in
Documentation/arm/whatever so that vendors who are stuck on gcc 3.3
(and binutils so old that they comment things out in vmlinux.lds) can
be encouraged to move forward.
