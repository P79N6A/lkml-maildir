I agree.
From a general perspective I still like to add some basic command line 
tool, which can be used for queries or simple manipulations. Here it also 
would be less a problem to add experimental or distribution specific 
functionality instead of overloading conf.c.
At some point I even had script bindings (via swig), so one could do even 
weirder stuff.
bye, Roman
