Has hello.c been posted?  I can't find it in any of the posts from you
or Thomas.  Am I just being blind? :)

Isn't it two separate read() calls to read the two counters?  If so,
the only way the two values are actually going to correspond to the
same point in time is if the task being monitored is stopped.  In
which case the monitoring task needs to use ptrace or something
similar in order to make sure that the monitored task is actually
stopped.
If the monitored task is not stopped, then the interval between the
two reads will be sufficient to render the results useless -
particularly since the monitoring task could get preempted for an
arbitrary length of time between the two reads.  But even if it
doesn't, the hundreds of cycles between the two reads will introduce
considerable imprecision in the results.
There really is value in being able to read all the counters you're
using in one system call.
Paul.
