mount no longer oopses but it still fails with the message:
root@celery:~# mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/ -t iso9660
mount: block device /dev/cdrom is write-protected, mounting read-only
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=03:40, iso_blknum=16, block=32
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom,
       or too many mounted file systems
       (aren't you trying to mount an extended partition,
       instead of some logical partition inside?)
