sigh. And we cannot even properly detect which unpin_page() was the last
unpinning of the page - there can be so many other reasons a page's count
is elevated. And keeping a page sticky forever is no solution either, the
number of sticky pages would increase significantly, causing real fork()
problems.

yeah, will try that now. I'm a bit worried about the mandatory cross-CPU
TLB flushes though.
