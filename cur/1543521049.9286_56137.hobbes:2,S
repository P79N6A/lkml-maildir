No, actually, it does no such thing. Gödel would be horrified at how many  
people completely misunderstand his results. They are far more specific  
than most people assume.
Specifically, Gödel is _not_ about the halting problem. That's a  
completely unrelated question.
And note that while Gödel says that classical number theory cannot be  
complete, most problems involving positive integers in everyday life are  
actually easily enough to solve - that is, while the _theories_ that don't  
have this problem are not very interesting, that doesn't mean the theories  
that do have it don't have an enormously large class of interesting  
_theorems_.
