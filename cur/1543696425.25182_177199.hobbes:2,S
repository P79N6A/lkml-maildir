OK, I ask THE question : why not using the normal nice level, via
current->static_prio ?
This way, cdrecord would be RT even in IO, and nice -19 updatedb would have
a minimal impact on the system.

So a process with ioprio == 0 can be forever starved. As it's not
done this way for nice -19 tasks (unlike FreeBSD), wouldn't it be
safer to give a very long deadline to ioprio == 0 requests ?
Thanks for making something I have been dreaming of for a long time :)
