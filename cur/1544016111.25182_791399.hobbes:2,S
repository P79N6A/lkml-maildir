Having one super block would be silly.
But aren't most kinds of replication better done behind the OSD level,
on the storage fabric?  OSD is all about letting the fabric decide
things like allocation and durability strategies after all.
With multiple super blocks at the filesystem level, some OS failures
that would trash one of the super blocks would simply trash all the copies.
I wonder how much less likely trashing one super block object than
trashing a set of them would be.
