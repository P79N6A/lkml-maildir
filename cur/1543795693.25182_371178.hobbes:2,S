I would argue that there is no "the embedded space," but rather a set of 
embedded spaces with various needs. Having worked doing industrial 
control for three years and lunched with IC folks another decade, I'm 
fairly sure that consumer goods are very different from real industrial 
control, a realtime items (multimedia) are different than phones and 
PDAs. Until the phone gets "swear at it" slow, features like voice 
recognition are more important than doing voice to number lookup in 20ms 
instead of 400ms. Cost and battery life matter a lot too, while the 
media and IC markets are already attached to expensive stuff, so the 
computer is is smaller fraction of the cost.

Absolutely true, but that dual core 200 MHz chip probably draws more 
power than a 200 MHz uni, etc. So there will probably be uni 
applications for the forseeable future, any benefit in uni performance 
will be useful.
