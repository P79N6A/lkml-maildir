So you are talking about a new interface that sucks. Slight difference
in situation no difference in result. At the point where link/rename and
even NFS happenings on remote boxes may get involved I don't want to go
anywhere near it. One thing Unix actually got right from the beginning
is that rights belong to objects not to names. Name based labelling has
never worked in or out of computing.
What you are suggesting is the equivalent of marking documents 'secret'
by putting them in a specific drawer and hoping nobody ever misfiles it.
Everyone instead writes "secret" on the document - guess why
