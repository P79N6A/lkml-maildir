I have an ITE raid card, that I bought to add more than 4 ide devices to
my server, as it was available from a supplier that I was ordering other
stuff from at the time, but vanilla IDE cards were not.
The card has source available from the maker,
http://www.ite.com.tw/pc/LinuxSrc_it8212_v1.44.zip
Which basically makes the drives act as SCSI ones.
Annoyingly, it does not seem to support DVD/CD drives, as these are not
detected in the cards BIOS, or by the driver. (I had planned to put a couple of
CD drives and a DVD on it.)
And SMART and other IDE specific tools do not work.
This is a pity, as I like to run home-rolled scripts to track SMART status,
monitor temperatures/...
Is there any "dumb" driver that simply presents the drives as hde-hdh?
