Then you have to motivate the management that it the initial development
cost is (roughly) doubled because of the process to get it accepted into
the kernel (instead of having a bloated converted driver from $OTHER_OS
which works just now somehow). And they didn't realize that bitrotting
is much faster in the free world then in the old-economy (i.e. Win*).

Yes, most of them (until the maintainer vanishes and after a year of
not-compiling-since-no-one-apparently-cares a patch to delete it is
submitted).

-) Because it was never accepted (yes, there are lots of reasons here -
   some are more valid, some are less valid as seen by the
   company/management financinf this)?
-) Because the have drivers + user-space libs for several OSes and want
   to keep them as similar and working together as possible?
