CAREFUL!
If you make real per-FS use of this, and aren't just using the standard 
ones, you need to be very very careful. In particular, you get called with 
the inode lock held, but you would have to drop the lock yourself after 
having removed the inode from the hash chains etc. I'd like people to 
avoid playing too many games in this area, the locking and the exact 
semantics of "drop_inode" are rather nasty.
