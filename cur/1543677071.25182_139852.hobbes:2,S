Is it good practice not to release, when the last version has even
more known bugs?  It's a trade-off and those are hard to get
objectively correct.
Personally, I still like the idea of a bugfix-only patch against
2.4.current [1], but in it's current state it just isn't taken serious
by 90% of kernel.org kernel users.
