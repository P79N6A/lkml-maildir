The bx chipset was designed to support dual cpus running at 100mhz fsb...
unless the chipset you have is defective or you've had to goose the
voltage to the cpu's , any issues you see relating to the overclock should
be cpu related. first generation bx dual boards such as the tyan 1832 have
no heatsink at all and appeared  at the time to operate nominally with the
pII-350/400's of the era.

my experience with mixed lots of 366 cpu's was that somewhat less than 40%
were what I'd describe as"stable" at 550mhz, which led me to conclude that
implementing dual 550's on a large scale was not feasable. I've settled
for dual 466's and 500's which appart from lower fsb speed (and lower
stream scores) seem to perform reasonably.
