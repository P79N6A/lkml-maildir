   I have several examples where the ordering of the PCI cards is critical
   to get stuff like boot device and primary controller detection right.
   pci_register_driver doesn't appear to have a good way to deal with this
   or have I missed something ?
Cards get registered in the order they appear on the bus, or at least
that is the way the algorithm worked the last time I looked.
Or, what other facility do you need?
