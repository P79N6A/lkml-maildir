Hi Eli,
I think just get_user_pages() should be sufficient: the pages won't be 
swapped out. You don't need to set VM_LOCKED in vma->vm_flags to prevent 
the swap out. In the worst case, the pte is cleared a that will cause a 
soft page fault, but the physical address won't change. Multiple 
get_user_pages() calls on overlapping regions are ok, the page count is 
an atomic_t, at least 24-bit large.
