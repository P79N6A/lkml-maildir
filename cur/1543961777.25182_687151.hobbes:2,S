Good point!!!

Here are some (probably totally broken) ideas:
1.	Global lock so that only one smp_call_function() in the
	system proceeds.  Additional calls would be spinning with
	irqs -enabled- on the lock, avoiding deadlock.  Kind of
	defeats the purpose of your list, though...
2.	Maintain a global mask of current targets of smp_call_function()
	CPUs.  A given CPU may proceed if it is not a current target
	and if none of its target CPUs are already in the mask.
	This mask would be manipulated under a global lock.
3.	As in #2 above, but use per-CPU counters.  This allows the
	current CPU to proceed if it is not a target, but also allows
	concurrent smp_call_function()s to proceed even if their
	lists of target CPUs overlap.
4.	#2 or #3, but where CPUs can proceed freely if their allocation
	succeeded.
5.	If a given CPU is waiting for other CPUs to respond, it polls
	its own list (with irqs disabled), thus breaking the deadlock.
	This means that you cannot call smp_call_function() while holding
	a lock that might be acquired by the called function, but that
	is not a new prohibition -- the only safe way to hold such a
	lock is with irqs disabled, and you are not allowed to call
	the smp_call_function() with irqs disabled in the first place
	(right?).
#5 might actually work...
