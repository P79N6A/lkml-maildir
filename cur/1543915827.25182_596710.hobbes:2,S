Which specific problems do you see with the coding style of the patch? Can you 
comment on it?

That would be a good idea, but I cannot use Qt there, which makes my job 
harder.

A filter function would still be convenient in this context, as the symbol 
data base API may change, and the filter function has a little logic in it.

I suggest we don't call it sym_generic_search, as generic implies it is a 
generic filter. We can call it "sym_string_search" or whatever. Then, I 
suggest we have separate arguments for every parameter (i.e: search type, 
case sensitivity, what to search, etc.).

Ah, OK.
