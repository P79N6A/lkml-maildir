The strace case I'm more than willing to pass off as a strace problem. 
I find it quite common that strace doesn't detach from processes, leaving 
some of them in a stopped state. So I assumed that the particular trace 
wasn't very interesting.
That's especially true since you said the behaviour doesn't actually occur
without "strace".
So considering the further details:

The bugs seems to be something totally different: you create a 
"CLONE_DETACHED" child, and then you expect to be able to wait for it. 
That's just bogus.
If the child is detached, that means that it reaps itself, and the
behaviour you _should_ see is pretty much undefined. Doing a "wait()" on a
detached child just doesn't make much sense.
So I think the "correct" behaviour actually ends up having the wait()  
pause, and once the child exits it reaps itself, and that in turn
will/should make the wait() notice that there are no children, and return
a -ENOCHLD.
Because with a detached thread, you really will never get the status - the 
child will have reaped itself and not given status to the parent.
But in theory it would be equally correct to just return ENOCHLD
_immediately_, since the clone was a DETACHED clone.
The "strace" behaviour may be a bug somewhere. I don't know if it's strace
or the kernel. But quite possibly, it's not even a "bug": exactly because 
the child was detached, when strace detaches from it, it wouldn't be 
re-attached to the parent, so there's nothing to wake the parent up again.
