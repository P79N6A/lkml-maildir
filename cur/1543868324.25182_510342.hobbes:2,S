we understand the original CSR HID proxy dongles, but for the Logitech
ones, it is wild guesses. The current support in hid2hci has been tested
on Logitech diNovo first generation and I have no other Logitech
hardware to verify it with. We might simply need the full HID report
descriptor to see who is at fault.
