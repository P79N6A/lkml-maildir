And what happen with the userspace binary blob ?
How it will know in which country you are ?
Does it access to a secret GPS on your computer ?
So there are 2 solutions :
- make the card work only for a country with a flag in a RO eeprom or in 
another place in the hardware (firmware, ....).
- make the card works on all the possible channels.
Also if the firmware need to be load each time you reset the card (this 
is the case with the current ipw2xxx implementation), you won't notice 
if you switch for a firmware for a country X to a firmware for a country Y.
