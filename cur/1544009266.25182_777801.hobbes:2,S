Applied to net-next-2.6, thanks Nick.
BTW, your original posting of this patch didn't make it to the mailing
lists because there were people's names on the CC: list which had a
"." character in them, and in such cases these names must be fully
surrounded by double quotes, otherwise it is an SMTP syntax error.
Please be mindful of this in the future.
