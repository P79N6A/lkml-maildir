This is needed for a very bad hack to get the EIP information in ps -lax:
most programs would be shown as hanging in schedule(), which would not be 
very useful to show the user. To avoid this sched.c is always compiled with 
frame pointers and if the EIP is inside these two functions the proc code 
goes back one level in the stack frame.
