In an interrupt context we do not have a process context. But there is
no exemption from memory policy constraints.

Yes sure if we do not have a context then no restrictions originating 
there can be enforced. So you want to restrict the logic now to
interrupt allocs? I.e. GFP_ATOMIC?

Correct. That is an optimization but it may be called anytime from the 
perspective of an execution thread and that may cause problems with your 
approach.

It will work with whatever was left behind in the case of SLUB and a 
kmalloc alloc (optimization there). It wont if its SLAB (which is 
stricter) or a kmalloc_node alloc. A kmalloc_node alloc will remove the 
current cpuslab if its not on the right now.

If it finds no partial slab then it will go to the page allocator which 
will allocate given the current contextual alloc constraints. In the case 
of a memory policy we may have limited the allocations to a single node 
where there is no escape (the zonelist does *not* contain zones of other 
nodes). The only chance to bypass this is by only dealing with allocations 
during interrupt that have no allocation context.
