Your expectation is faulty. An out of tree vendor patch needs
to be kept up to date with the evolving kernel, not the other
way around.
Also, the only major improvement in the vendor patch is support for
the Yukon2 hardware, but the code is so macroized that it will
never be accepted in it's current form.
