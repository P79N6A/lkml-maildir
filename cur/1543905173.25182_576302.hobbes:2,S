No. What I said outright, every single time, is that swap-prefetch in itself 
seems to make sense. And specifically that even if the _direct_ problem is a 
crummy program, it _still_ makes sense generally. Every single time.
But see -- you failed to notice this because you guys are stuck in this dumb 
adversary "us against them" thing so inherent of (online) communities, where 
you sit around your own habitats patting each other on the back for extended 
periods of time and then every once a while go out clinging on to each other 
vigorously and going "boo! hiss!" at the big bad outside world.
I already got overly violent at one point in this thread so I'll leave out 
any further references to sense-deprived fanboy-culture but please, I said 
every single time that I'm not against swap-prefetch. I cannot communicate 
when I'm not being read.

It has not. Concerns that were raised (by specifically Nick Piggin) weren't 
being addressed.

And swinging a dead rat from its tail facing east-wards while reciting 
Documentation/CodingStyle.
Okay, very very sorry, that was particularly childish, but that "walking to 
the printer" is ofcourse completely constructed and this _is_ something to 
take into account. Swap-prefetch wants to be free, which (also again) it is 
doing a good job at it seems, but this also means that it waits for the VM 
to be _very_ idle before it does anything and as such, we cannot just forget 
the "nightly" scenario and pretend it's about something else entirely. As 
long as the machine's being used, swap-prefetch doesn't kick in.
Which is a good feature for swap-prefetch, but also something that needs to 
weighed alongside its other features in a discussion of alternatives, where 
for example something like a larger swap granularity would not have anything 
of the sort to take into account. If it were about walks to the printer, we 
could shelve the issue as being of too limited practical use for inclusion.

Arjan van de Ven made another point here about seeking away due to 
swap-prefetch (just) before the next request comes in, but that's probably a 
bit of a non-issue in practice with the "very idle" precondition.

I saw Chris Snook make a good post here and am going to defer this part to 
that discussion:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/27/421
But no, it's not a red herring if _practically_ speaking the swapin is fast 
enough once started that people don't actually mind anymore since in that 
case you could simply do without yet more additional VM complexity (and 
kernel daemon).

No, it's not just future. Just look at the various things under discussion 
now such as improved use-once and better swapin.
