Again, this can deadlock. migration_thread() is SCHED_FIFO, and it shares the
same CPU with req->task. We are doing a busy-wait loop, req->task may have no
chance to finish its critical section.

As Peter pointed out, we hold up all other migration requests.
And worse, this can hang forever (until another req comes). do_check_migrate()
can wake_up() the wrong rq.
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) is bogus, we can miss a wakeup from
(say) sched_migrate_task().
