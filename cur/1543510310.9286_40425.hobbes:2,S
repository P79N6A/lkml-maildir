Well, just as another data-point, I was unable to reproduce it on my
SparcStation once I recompiled the kernel UP. Bummer. 
It's definitely a locking buglet though; I've been reading up on spinlocks
and it seems like a read/write spinlock might be the thing to help. I'm
still unsure of where exactly the "writing" is taking place -- I see where
fbc is read (and dereferenced), but I don't see where it's scribbled
(causing the oops). The struct isn't very well commented so I can't
ascertain exactly what the fbc is all about; I'm guessing it points to 
the frame buffer control register, but then why is it changing?
Hmph. The thoughts of an aspiring kernel hacker :)
