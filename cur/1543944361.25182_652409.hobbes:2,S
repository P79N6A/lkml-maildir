Hey-
	Some intermediate results:
I've instrumented head.S in the kernel with the following code:
#define SEROUT(z) \     
mov $0x3F8,%dx;\
movb z,%al;\
outb %dx
And peppered different ascii characters throughout the startup code from
startup_32 to right before the jump to start_kernel.  When I panic the system
via an:
echo c > /proc/sysrq_trigger
I see an appropriate sequence of characters on the serial console
When I panic the box by forcing an NMI watchdog timeout however, I see nothing.
 The machine will either hang, or reset into the bios.  I think this is
reasonably conclusive in its indication that we're not getting into the second
kernel when this problem occurs.  Next I'll instrument the purgatory code in a
simmilar way.
Regards
Neil
