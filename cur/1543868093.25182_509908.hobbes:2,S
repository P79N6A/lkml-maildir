Shouldn't security_fixup_ops be exported?
Otherwise I have to include the kernel's security/dummy.c to use it and there's no other way to fix all the ops for a secondary module without copying a list of all the ops, which may change in future kernels, into the module's code.
Unless of course including kernel source in modules is ok, because the module will need to have been compiled with the right version of struct security_operations anyway.
