Yeah, if we even want to introduce a new syscall for this...
But Documentation/Changes is not an empty file, i.e., we require
people to upgrade userspace anyways.

Yes, but only by a short head. And, since comp_t is hard-coded into 
current GNU acct tools, we can't keep source compatibility
(not that this matters too much anyways...)
I'm open for suggestions in this direction. Any reasonable ideas to
get more precision? (e.g. 16 bit mantissa and 4 bit base-whatever 
exponent?)

Yep, but depending on architecure I think the compiler is free to insert
the padding either before or after ac_flags.

Yupp, I changed this for the new suggested binary-incompatible layout.

Yes, but I'd prefer an arch-independent and prominent position
(i.e. one that doesn't perturb alignment at the beginning of the struct)
