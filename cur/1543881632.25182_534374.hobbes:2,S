NUMA allocation can only be controlled for the highest zone. If you switch 
to another zone then no control of the node is possible anymore.

It falls back from HIGHMEM to NORMAL (on 32 bit numa that means node 0. 
The result of your patch is that someone requiring an alloc on node 4 will
get memory on node 0).

It does not. It will happily move the pages into highmem. The filesystem 
cannot expect the page to remain in the same zone without holding a 
reference count. Swap may also move pages between zones. There is nothing 
special in what page migration does here.
I would say that the filesystem is broke if it has such expectations 
regardless of page migration.
