I didn't say that.
IMHO it isn't even useful to try to keep free loaders away,
it's better to try and integrate them gradually. That's part
of the game.
(Where "free loaders" is a term introduced by Alexandre, not by me.)
The GPLv2 is a sufficient tool to defend free software
against those that don't even grasp tit-for-tat. But if
they do, you can talk to them *as peers* and try to convince
them that there's more to free software than just tit-for-tat.
But it has to be their decision, IMHO it's wrong to force them.
The GPLv3 tries to be a tool to defend against those that
don't subscribe to the full Free Software Definition.
