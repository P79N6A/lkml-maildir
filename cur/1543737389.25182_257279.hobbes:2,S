Can we add to this "km" library ? (That's the GATOS v4l module)
In particular, I can contribute the code that does Framebuffer->System Ram
transfers over PCI/AGP. It is currently GPL licensed, but there is no 
problem if BSD folks want it too.
This is also potentially useful for any Mesa functions that want to 
transfer data back from video RAM - using plain reads for this is really slow.
