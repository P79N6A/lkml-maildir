Because you want to wait for the uart to show that it is ready to accept
a character, not that the byte has been clocked out entirely. Thats
essential for working with virtual serial ports on servers as they use
the fact there is no pending character to work out how to packetize it
as a TCP stream.

When it gets stuck what state are the serial chip registers in and where
is the OS hanging ?
