My fu dictates that continuation lines (line 2 in this example)
should have more indent than line 1, and that the inner block code
(lines 3 and 4) should have more indent than line 2. Using
/^\t+\x20{2,8}/ on continuation line(s) is perfect because it does
not cause either the continuation line(s) or the inner block code to
move too much to the right.
