This works fine as long as you are in the submitter context, but once
you pass the into the block layer, we don't have any way to find the
address space (at least we don't want to). Would something like this be
workable, name withstanding:
static unsigned long page_size(struct page *page)
{
        struct address_space *mapping;
        int order = 0;
        mapping = page_mapping(page);
        if (mapping)
                order = mapping->order;
        return PAGE_CACHE_SIZE << order;
}
