Hello Alan,
if I add a dedicated line discipline to register/unregister the PPS
source and I leave the pps_event management into
uart_handle_dcd_change() function, it can be acceptable?
The uart_handle_dcd_change() is generic and I need the DCD status to
correctly manage the pps_event. The USB layer is not useful for PPS
stuff.
Thanks for your suggestions,
Rodolfo
