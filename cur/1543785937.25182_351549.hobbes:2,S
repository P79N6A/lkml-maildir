When was "last time"?

I have three boxes running Reiser4 for everything except /boot, and no 
problems yet, except an occasional missing feature, like a 
repacker/resizer.  One's a Pentium 3, the other two are amd64s.
I've had a total of one crash each on the amd64s, and one of those was 
while playing a game, and could easily have been the nvidia drivers.  I 
can't reproduce the other one, and the box has been fine since -- and 
both amd64s are overclocked by 600 mhz, so I have a sneaking suspicion 
that it might have been hardware.
No crashes yet on the Pentium 3, which isn't overclocked at all.
No lost data yet either, in fact, I recovered from an essential 'rm -rf' 
of a Reiser4 partition, so I could even say Reiser4 (or rather, 
fsck.reiser4) has *found* data for me.
For a long time, it's been painfully obvious that the reasons Reiser4 
isn't in the kernel all have to do with things like coding style and 
politics.  At this point, if I tried to do anything more than be an 
active user, I'd be so far out of my depth I'd need a life jacket.
