If that's the case, I'd rather the CK804 and MCP04 SATA device IDs be
added to sata_nv, since we want distributions to support these SATA
controllers when silicon does become available.

That's true.  I kinda chalk this up as an inevitable kernel upgrade
issue (they'll be getting support for NVIDIA SATA under libata with
eventual device hotplug support, at the cost of some system
reconfiguration).  Is there a good solution?
