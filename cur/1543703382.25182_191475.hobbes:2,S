What happens first is you will see kernel data corruption as irq exceeds
224 (NR_IRQS). 
In setup_IO_APIC_irqs(), for example, we do 
	if (IO_APIC_IRQ(irq)) {
             vector = assign_irq_vector(irq);
             entry.vector = vector;
             ioapic_register_intr(irq, vector, IOAPIC_AUTO);
             if (!apic && (irq < 16))
                    disable_8259A_irq(irq);
      }
Then ioapic_register_intr() does:
      if ((trigger == IOAPIC_AUTO && IO_APIC_irq_trigger(irq)) ||
                trigger == IOAPIC_LEVEL)
                        irq_desc[irq].handler = &ioapic_level_type;
                else
                        irq_desc[irq].handler = &ioapic_edge_type;
                set_intr_gate(vector, interrupt[irq]);
Now of course irq_desc_t irq_desc[NR_IRQS], and same with interrupt[]. 
I think we need to add checking in IO_APIC_IRQ(irq) like from
#define IO_APIC_IRQ(x) (((x) >= 16) || ((1<<(x)) & io_apic_irqs)) to
#define IO_APIC_IRQ(x) (((x) < NR_IRQS) && ((x) >= 16) || ((1<<(x)) &
io_apic_irqs))
