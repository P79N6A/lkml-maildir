Yes, but if it is true, you can safely turn on Burn-Proof by default,
since the only cases where it would hurt are the cases when it would
fail without Burn-Proof anyway.
Also, as many people regularly use non-suid-root cdrecord without
Burn-Proof being ever used (even though I don't assert that it is
always the case), I would very much appreciate if cdrecord could
be configured (in cdrecord.conf) that I really wish to run it
without mlocking and RT priority if I know what I'm doing.
				Have a nice fortnight
