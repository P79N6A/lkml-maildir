And indeed, in patch-2.3.13 the call to ide_setup() was removed from init/main.c
but was not added anywhere else, so ide_setup() is not called.
The IDE maintainer should probably look more in detail at how he
wants things to be done, but adding
__setup("ide", ide_setup);
__setup("hd", ide_setup);
will fix most problems.

[I meant - adding this to ide.c]
