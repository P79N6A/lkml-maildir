It may be a question of taste, but even if that did work, which I am
not convinced of, it seems to me that it's awfully convoluted.
With the current interrupt pipeline mechanism part of Adeos, on
which RTAI and RTAI fusion are built, I can give you absolute hard-rt
deterministic guarantees while keeping the spinlocks intact, and not
having to check for the rt-safeness of any part of the kernel. You
just write the time-sensitive saw driver int handler in front of
Linux in the ipipe and you're done: 100% deterministic hard-rt,
regardless of the application load and the driver set.

Here are some interesting links:
RTAI/fusion presentation by Philipppe Gerum last July (see slide 25
for some interesting numbers):

Here's a thread that explains the details about RTAI/fusion:

Here's the ipipe core API:
