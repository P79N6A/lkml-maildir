Hi Mark,
I commented out the line.  Mtab now reported:
/dev/hda7 / ext2 rw 0 0
proc /proc proc rw 0 0
/dev/hda5 /boot ext2 rw 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
The result of hdparm -tT /dev/hda was, however, exactly the same as before (ie circa 15 MB/sec.  The results for /dev/hda7 remain at about 30 MB/sec.
Further, even though the relevant line was commented out of fstab, I could still perform hdparm -tT /dev/hda1 (giving the usual 15 MB/sec).  I suppose that this is because fdisk still showed :
Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 3737 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1       932   7486258+   b  Win95 FAT32
/dev/hda2           933      3737  22531162+   5  Extended
/dev/hda5           933       935     24066   83  Linux
/dev/hda6           936       952    136521   82  Linux swap
/dev/hda7           953      3737  22370481   83  Linux
On the other hand, am I correct in interpreting the bonnie output for the block read (included in my earlier post), of 20937 KB/sec as reasonably healthy for my DTLA (ie consistent with hdparm's 30 MB/sec), when performing more realistic tasks on the linux filesystem ?
Regards,
Geoff
