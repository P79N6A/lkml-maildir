I don't have an estimate.  This is all very slippery because once I get 
into a part of the code, we discover a lot of issues that we didn't 
expect.  The NFS mount stuff is largely historical; we've all forgotten 
(or never really knew) how it works.

Yes, that would be nice, but there's a lot of stuff that needs to get 
done before this.  NFS IPv6, for example, is a higher priority than 
refactoring to remove /etc/mtab -- the US government has a new 
requirement in 2008 for IPv6 support in any software that it purchases, 
and NFS may be a stumbling block for distributors if it doesn't have it.
So I'd say "no way" for 2.6.24, but it's really Trond's call to make.

Like you, I don't expect it will be difficult to implement, but I have 
too many balls in the air to make any promises at the moment.  Plus, we 
can't really predict when distributors will feel the in-kernel mount 
parsing stuff will be ready for their users.
