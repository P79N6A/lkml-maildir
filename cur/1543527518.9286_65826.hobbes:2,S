So why do you think your implementation of this doesn't have the deadlock
that every other implementation has?
The deadlock is due to priority inversion, where a "idle-priority" task
gets a resource (say the directory semaphore), goes to sleep, and never
wakes up again because there is some slightly more important process
running all the time.
In short, this has been tried before, and it has ALWAYS been a serious
security holw full of denial-of-service kind of attacks.
