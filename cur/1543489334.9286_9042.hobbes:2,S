there are no scheduling changes in 2.2.3. i usually 'test' interactivity
by running 'ping otherhost' while doing a kernel compile, and with 2.2.3 i
just got:
 123 packets transmitted, 123 packets received, 0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max = 0.1/0.1/0.6 ms
 [mingo@moon mingo]$
this kernel compilation causes a load of 15. And never was the ping
process delayed for more than 0.6 seconds. (and the average was 0.1 msecs) 
Needless to say, interactive 'feeling' is good as well, not only ping
times.
sound drivers are of course different from networking sockets, driver bugs
_might_ cause such problems.
does a simple inifit loop trigger this behavior? Or do you need heavy disk
(or networking) traffic to trigger it?
