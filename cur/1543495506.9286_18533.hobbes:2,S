I completely understood that.  My point was that if the utilities are seen
to be sufficiently close to the kernel, we can assume that it will be less
than five years before the older versions are no longer being used with new
kernels.
For example, every distribution ships with lilo and ?fdisk as part of the
base package.  The number of people who need to upgrade their kernel but who
still keep an old LILO for use with it is, I would submit, very small.

I don't think we are "breaking old stuff" too badly.  There's already code
in setup.S to check who/what loaded us, so presumably this kind of exercise
has been done before.  Sure, it should be phased in, but I don't think it's
beyond reason to fix LILO and FDISK, let the developers of other utilities
know where the library is so they can get _correct_ disk geometry (many of
them will be pleased to be able to incorporate your experience with disk
layouts into their programs), and announce that 2.3.mumble will be the last
version that can install a _later_ kernel with on old LILO and without
specifying linear geometry.
All software development is a tradeoff between functional advances and
backwards compatibility.  LILO and FDISK are so fundamental that I reckon
they can be counted as almost part of the kernel.
I guess the decision to take functionality out is not something one takes
lightly (read: without Linus).  But if it has to be done, five years from
tomorrow is nearer than five years from next month, I suppose.
