 - After shutting down the Alpha with a "reboot" command, the last message
on the console was "Rebooting...". After that... nothing. Not even a
power-off - power-on helped, anymore. I just get 4 beeps from my Alpha
now, indicating an invalid firmware checksum... So 2.5.39 seems to be an
alpha2brick release :-(
