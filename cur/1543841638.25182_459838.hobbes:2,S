If we define __raw_writeq() to be 64-bit-atomic-on-the-bus then an
appropriate solution for ipath would be to call __raw_writeq() directly. 
If the arch cannot implement __raw_write() then build error -> Kconfig fix.

It depends on how many other devices have (or are expected to have)
mthca-like requirements.  If the answer is "very few, maybe none" then
perhaps we don't need to go designing generic interfaces to support such
things.
As for interfaces, umm, something like
#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_64BIT_ATOMIC_MMIO_WRITES
struct be64_port {
	void __iomem *addr;
};
static inline void atomic_be64_mmio_write(u64 v, struct be64_port *port)
{
	__raw_writeq(v, port->addr);
}
#define be64_port_init(port, addr)
	port->addr = addr;
#define be64_port_init_external_locking(port, addr, lockp)
	be64_port_init(port, addr)
#else
struct be64_port {
	void __iomem *addr;
	spinlock_t lock;
	spinlock_t *lockp;
};
static inline void atomic_be64_mmio_write(u64 v, struct be64_port *port)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	
	spin_lock_irqsave(port->lockp, flags);
	__raw_writel(...);
	__raw_writel(...);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(port->lockp, flags);
}
#define be64_port_init(port, addr)
	spin_lock_init(&port->lock);
	port->lockp = &port->lock;
	port->addr = addr;
#define be64_port_init_external_locking(port, addr, lockp)
	port->lockp = lockp;
	port->addr = addr;
#endif
perhaps?
btw, 32-bit mthca_write64() is downright scary from an endianness POV.  I
guess it's right, but I wouldn't label it "obviously correct" ;)
