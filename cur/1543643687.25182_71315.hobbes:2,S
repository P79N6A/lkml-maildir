Thanks Ben.  I just pulled down the latest patch and library and tried
them out on my ia64 box.  Many of the tests in the testsuite passed,
but I encountered a hang during 'make check' after 6.t ran.  Here's
the output up to that point:
[root@ainek1 harness]# make check
rm -f testdir/rofile
echo "test" >testdir/rofile
chmod 400 testdir/rofile
rm -f testdir/rwfile
echo "test" >testdir/rwfile
chmod 600 testdir/rwfile
rm -f testdir/wofile
echo "test" >testdir/wofile
chmod 200 testdir/wofile

Unfortunately, I don't have kdb compiled into this kernel so I can't
give you a backtrace right now, but maybe you've already run into this
problem?
Thanks,
Jesse
