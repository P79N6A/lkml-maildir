I don't understand where hrtimers or interface speed comes in. If the 
CPU is fast enough to call poll() 100,000 times per jiffies tick, it 
means 100,000 wasted poll() calls while the netdev migrates from active 
to poll-off state. Hence the need to fastpath the "no work" case in the 
netdev's poll(). These extra poll() calls are tolerable if it avoids 
NAPI thrashing between poll-on and poll-off states for certain packet rates.

I don't recall saying anything in previous posts about this. Are you 
confusing my posts with Jan-Bernd's? Jan-Bernd has been talking about 
using hrtimers to _reschedule_ NAPI. My posts are suggesting an 
alternative mechanism that keeps NAPI active (with interrupts disabled) 
for a jiffy or two after it would otherwise have gone idle in order to 
avoid too many interrupts when the packet rate is such that NAPI 
thrashes between poll-on and poll-off.
