See the README i cut&pasted below. It's the readme for intel's pxe-0.1 
for linux.. with all the relevant links in it.
ps, do note your BIOS has to be pc99 compliant to be able to do PXE booting.
If not, your alternatives are 1) a boot eprom with a kernel image or 
boot loader or 2) a floppy / cdrom with a boot loader and a kernel. This 
kernel can be configured for DHCP / nfsroot, so the actualy loading and 
anything afterwards will happen over the network.
