Yes. But this shouldn't matter because we can't ptrace them. /sbin/init
doesn't block SIGKILL, but it can't be ptraced either.
Also, SIGKILL is blocked only if kthread was created by kernel_thread() and
then it does daemonize(). kthread_create()'ed kthreads don't block SIGKILL
but ignore it. The latter behaviour is more correct, but we can't do the same
for kernel_thread() threads.
