I recognize that having internationalized messages would be an 
advantage.  The question is whether or not that advantage outweighs the 
disadvantage.
This shouldn't stop anyone from working on it, however.  My message 
compression work only shaves off about 64k, MAYBE, which compared to the 
rest of the kernel footprint is tiny.  What you get is a more complex 
printk, no lower-case letters, and a meager space savings.  Embedded 
users might like it, but they'll start out with less text to compress in 
the first place; those who stand to benefit the most are the ones who 
can benefit the least.  Oh, and the build process will take at least 
twice as long.  IF this can be implemented in a way that makes it 
entirely transparent, maybe a few people will use it, so my primary 
motivation for doing it is that I'm enjoying working on it.  :)

I used 2.4.20.  I modified Rules.make.  The line which does the compile 
(line 60), I changed like this:
%.o: %.c
    $(CPP) $(CFLAGS) $(EXTRA_CFLAGS_nostdinc) -DKBUILD_BASENAME=$(subst 
$(comma),_,$(subst -,_,$(*F))) $(CFLAGS_$@) $< > $<.i ; \
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(EXTRA_CFLAGS_nostdinc) -DKBUILD_BASENAME=$(subst 
$(comma),_,$(subst -,_,$(*F))) $(CFLAGS_$@) -c -o $@ $<
When I built the kernel, for every .o file, I also got a .c.i file.  I 
used a script to scan the tree for .i files.  This is the script:
#!/bin/sh
for i in `ls -A | grep .i$`
do
    if [ -f $i ]
    then
        /home/tim/tmp/prkex < $i
    fi
done
for i in `ls -A`
do
    if [ -d $i ]
    then
    P=`pwd`
    cd $i
    $0
    cd $P
    fi
done
And here's 'prkex', a horrible little extraction program that I hacked 
together rather abruptly.  It doesn't do anything cool like use yacc or 
regex.  It gets the printk format strings using a half-wit state 
machine.  I figure I can get away with posting it because it's shorter 
than a lot of patches I see.  :)
