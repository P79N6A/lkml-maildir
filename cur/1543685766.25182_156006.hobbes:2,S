Seems the problem has gone by using the original Debian kernel 2.4.18...
Reading a little bit the different changelog of kernel between 2.4.18
and 2.4.21, it seems that there are some vm change incorporated (from
-aa)...but I'm not an expert at all.
Another thing is that the load is about 2 or 3...
I hope somebody will have an idea off what's going on...
Have fun,
Jean-Yves
