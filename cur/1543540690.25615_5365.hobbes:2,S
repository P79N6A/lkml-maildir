3 keywords:
   -  reordering of the list breaks _all_ scanpoints
   -  wraparound inside the scanner breaks ordering or it should
      store it's starting point globally
   -  state transistions _require_ reordering, which will affect
      all scanners
conclusions:
   -  scanners can only run exclusive (spinlock()ed) one at a
      point, if they can ever reorder the list, until the reach
      their temporally success or wrap point
   -  scanners, that don't reorder the list have to be run under
      the guarantee, that the list will _never_ change until they
      reach their wrap point or succeed for now
Isn't this really bad for performance? It would imply a lot of
waiting, but I haven't measured this ;-)
With the multiple list approach we can skip pages easily and
avoid contention and stuck scanners (waiting for the list_lock to
become free). 
Even your headache with the "purpose" of the lists might get
adressed, if you consider adding a queue in between for the
special state you need (like "dirty_but_not_really_list" ;-)).
The only wish _I_ have is having portal functions for _all_ state
transitions, which can be used as entry point for future
extensions which should continue adding portal functions for
their own transistions.
Practical example: *Nobody* was able to tell me, where we stop
   accessing a swapped out page (so it can be encrypted) and
   where we start accessing a swapped in page (so it has to be
   decrypted). 
   Would be no problem (nor a question ;-)) with portal functions
   for this important state transition.
PS: Maybe I didn't get your point with the "scan-points"
   approach.
