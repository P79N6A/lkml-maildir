Further to what acme said, markers are semantics-free.  Callback
functions that implement your entry & exit semantics can be attached
at run time, at your pleasure.  (So can systemtap probes, for that
matter.)  The main difference would be that these callback functions
would have manage the per-thread LIFO data structures themselves,
instead of allocating backpointers on the kernel stack.  (Bonus marks
for not modifying task_struct. :-)
