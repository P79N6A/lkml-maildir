I'd like to, but it's more than just an issue of time.  The issue of how in 
the heck to host such a thing is going back and forth now.  This may yet 
happen.  not...no not quite what I'd planned when I first started this 
thread, but not completely outside of what I was expecting.
You want something done (right...or at all ;) ) ya gotta do it yourself.  I 
just don't want to completely be the lone ranger.  If I do this as a public 
effort it has to be useful to others.  Because if I'm doing it as a private 
effort, I can get sloppy and I don't have to maintain a web page or have 
hosting bandwidth for it or repositories outside of the normal private svn 
repo I keep. :)
Thanks for all those who've participated (and continue to participate) in 
this discussion/debate.  It's been very informative even if I started it 
out badly.
