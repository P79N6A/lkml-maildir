there are two types of NFS error - minor and major.  soft and hard mounts deal 
with the errors differently.  both mount types handle a minor error in the 
same way, accept the error, increase the 'minor error' count, and do a backoff 
resending the request at longer and longer intervals until the 'minor error' 
count is large enough (settable through timeo= and retrans=) when a major 
error occurs.  At this point, a soft mount will return an I/O error and abort. 
 A hard mount will keep going and report and 'nfs: server <host> not 
responding, still trying'.
| Perhaps I have to tune the retrans settings when mounting 'soft'...
you could, although that's more of a bandage than a fix.
