I don't know what you mean with CS8011/CS8012 maybe you're talking about
what you suppouse is my IDE chipset but i dink that my chip is a HOLTEK
HT65521R i'm not shure i just saw a chip with that name in my mainboard
and since you have a controler for the HOLTEK HT6560B i say "that must be
the IDE chip" maybe it doesn't. 
Please, if you have some news about this problem let me know. My "linux
life" has become a hell since this bug came out a few months ago when i
upgrade to 2.2 and seems that get back to 2.0 isn't any help because now
it
is also hanging, with other message, but by the same reason.    
I was using linux since almost a year before upgrade to 2.2 and never have
any problem with the IDE controler.
