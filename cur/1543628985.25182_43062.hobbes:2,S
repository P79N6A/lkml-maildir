These first three look good.  I made a few minor changes and merged it
with the big-endian patch, so I'll send you my current version before
sending it onwards to Marcelo and Linus.
The big-endian patch was waiting for 2.4.19 to be released, but maybe I
should just submit it if 2.4.19 is going to be a while.  Also, all of
the big-endian changes are checked into the CVS tree now.
