I'm not completely sure I understand where you are coming from here?
I assume you mean adding -fno-stack-protector to the host userlands
CFLAGS variable (or similar) to make it a global change, but if so
you're missing my point.
Effectively, anyone who currently has -fstack-protector enabled in
userland (regardless of distribution, or otherwise) will fail to build
the tools required. I do realise that gcc should not call this stuff
with ssp enabled, but there are legitimate cases for this to happen.
Also, just to bare in mind that this does not occur anywhere else except
for the "self-contained" code in arch/powerpc/boot, and it only occurs
here because we have a different userland and kernel ABI.
