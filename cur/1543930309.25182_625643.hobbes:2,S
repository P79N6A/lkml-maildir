For what it's worth, I changed the module processing in depmod so that
it doesn't output duplicate entries. Having duplicates is not the right
solution - especially modalias entries that depend entirely upon the
file layout on disk when you run depmod against a kernel.
Thanks for the ordering patches folks - a good idea!
Jon.
