Greetings,
In 2.6.10-rc2 and previous kernels acpi_power_off allways worked fine, but in
2.6.10-rc2-mm1 when I do 'halt' all runs fine, the last message "acpi_power_off
called. System is going to power off" (something like this, I don't recall
^-^;) appears, but then the machine just doesn't power off.
This is happening with an ASUS M3N laptop, I guess that it's a problem
somewhere in
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10-rc2/2.6.10-rc2-mm1/broken-out/bk-acpi.patch
When I get some time I'll take a deeper look into it...
