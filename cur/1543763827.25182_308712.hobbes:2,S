Right, I've got that part.  The plan has been to mmap(), ioctl(), and
inside the ioctl do a copy_from_user() into a kernel-context buffer.

That's an interesting concept, and one I'm not familiar with.  Any useful
pointers (beyond UTSL)?  I'll admit to being much more familiar with SCSI
and USB internals than I am with something like device-layer interfacing.
It sounds like you're saying that my driver can implement an mmap() method
(similar to the ioctl method), and then I can just mmap the source file and
the driver /dev node and do a memcpy() between them. 
That's an interesting idea, but potentially not what I need.  The data
needs to go with some command information and a buffer to stuff the results
in.  This is basically a co-processor device I'm talking to.  The basic
data path here is from a file, through the driver, to a custom piece of
hardware (and back again).
Tho, anything that allows me to move the data from the disk up to a place
where I can pci_map_single() it faster is a Good Thing(tm).
