Well, I object to the "without thinking" bit.  It seems to me that
code that raises a softirq without having either hard interrupts or
BHs disabled is buggy - why would you want to do that?  And if we do
want to allow that, shouldn't we put the check in raise_softirq or the
equivalent, to get the minimum latency?

Soft irqs should definitely not be much heavier than an irq handler,
if they are then we have implemented them wrongly somehow.

ksoftirqd seems like the wrong solution to the problem to me, if we
really getting starved by softirqs then we need to look at whether
whatever is doing it should be a kernel thread itself rather than
doing it in softirqs.  Do you have a concrete example of the
starvation/live lockup that you can describe to us?

Paul.
