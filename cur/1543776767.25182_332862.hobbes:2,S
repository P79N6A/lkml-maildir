I tested on a small NUMA machine (2 nodes), with a epoll enabled application,
that use around 100 epoll ctl per second.
Of course, one may write a special benchmark on a BIG SMP/NUMA machine that
  defeat these patch, using thousands of epoll ctl per second, but, a normal (well written ?)
epoll application doesnt constantly add/remove epoll ctl.
Should we waste 8 bytes per 'struct file' for a very unlikely micro benchmark ?
