To be honest, I don't understand a word of what you are saying here. Could you
give an example of a ``contention problem'' and how it should be solved?

I find this a little abstract. Sure, there might be areas where POSIX doesn't supply
all the needed tools, e.g. one might want some scheduling policy especially for
audio, but to say that POSIX isn't good enough without providing much
explanation...
