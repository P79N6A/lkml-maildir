hm, okay.  Thanks for your help in working all that out.
Everything should have just balanced itself out - nothing in the memory
reclaim area cares or knows about the actual size of the objects.
You could run out of memory simply because the things are 20x bigger, but
only if they were pinned - say, a larger number of files open, or a large
number of files in ramfs or sysfs.
But from your last-gasp slabinfo the three caches seem to be of a
reasonable size.  It's a bit of a mystery.
