Your distribution grew by 2.5 floppy disks. I assume you are using glibc,
if so you clearly dont care about the odd 2Mbytes here and there. Your 
embedded system hasnt changed size at all. Since your embedded customers
almost certainly want to compile their own applications they are kind of
likely to want binutils and gcc anyway. You have to ship the kernel
source so whats the problem.

So you think its more important to ship 3.5Mb less code to a small number
of embedded systems people than to slap another chunk of code into the kernel
that needs maintaining, updating and downloading by zillions of mainstream
users.
I don't.
