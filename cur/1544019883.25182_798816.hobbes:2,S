Ok, what I meant was:
>From searching spc4r17, VLC_SA_RECEIVE_CREDENTIAL (0x1800) is the only
SPC-4 defined VARIABLE_LENGTH_CMD defined Service Action in Table D.8.
>From SPC-4, the range 0x1800 -> 0x1FFF is reserved for SPC-4 defined
VARIABLE_LENGTH_CMD SAs.  
I see that OSD SAs for VARIABLE_LENGTH_CMD opcode are defined in range
0x8800 -> 0x8FFF, so does not it make sense to add the single VLC_SA_*
prefixed define above for range 0x1800 -> 0x1FFF in
include/scsi/scsi.h..?
Many thanks for your most valuable of time,
