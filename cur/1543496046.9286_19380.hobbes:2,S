Hi,
In a kernel-wishlist for 2.1 / 2.2 there was a wish about faster /proc
access (i.e. binary /proc). I thought this was a nice project for me to 
start real kernel development (in the past, I've only hacked a bit and
worked on the GGI project) For I'm new to this list, I want to ask if any 
important messages on this topic have been on this list in the past.
(maybe this project is cancelled / already done ?)
I wrote down my own ideas on my web-site. Take a look at them at
http://kwik.ele.tue.nl/
 .I'm still thinking of most things, but at least
you have an idea.
Greetings,
Jos Hulzink, josh@stack.nl
