The only thing the kernel can do generically in this case is what it's 
doing already - disabling the interrupt line. What needs to be done to a 
device to clear the interrupt is device-dependent. If the interrupt 
doesn't get cleared by the handler, it will just keep interrupting 
continuously and using a ton of CPU time.
You could try disabling the USB controller and see if the APC card still 
is producing spurious interrupts. If that's the case, though, fixing the 
driver (so that it properly recognizes the interrupts) or the hardware 
(so it doesn't generate spurious interrupts) is about the only option.
