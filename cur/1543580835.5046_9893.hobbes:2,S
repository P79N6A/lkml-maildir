Do a 'cp -a linux-2.4.0 linux-2.4.1', and symlinks (asm...) will not be
de-referenced.
Or even better, if you are going to patch, do a 'cp -rl', and your new
tree will not waste almost any space (hard-links all the files, so space
only is duplicated when patch changes some file - and if you remove the
old kernel tree, the space just goes to the new).
