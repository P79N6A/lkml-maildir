That appears to be an accurate description - all the 0xff values (that
includes the m'cast reg read/write check Alan added) that are being
read tend to indicate the card fell off the planet. (Oxff = vacant I/O
port).  You have some sort of hardware problem/misconfiguration here.

Is the card a PnP card?  It almost sounds like the card is being
deactivated and requires the PnP BIOS to reactivate it again via 
a cold boot.

Make sure the ISA bus is running default 8MHz, conservative settings
for I/O cycle wait states (if supplied in CMOS setup), double check
for I/O conflict with another device (and/or try different I/O 
location, and even try another ISA bus slot...). Try another ne2k
card if you have one handy, or try that one in another machine.

Yes - given that they are two different computers.
