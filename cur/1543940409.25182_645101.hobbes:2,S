I apologize again for the long delay in responding with the requested
additional data needed to understand the performance of this patch.
The complete information is available at:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~porterde/kernel-patch.html#subsequent
I instrumented the kernel within simics to determine that the mean
value of the count is 7 and the order is 0 for both free_pages_bulk()
and rmqueue_bulk() for the simulation workloads.
I applied the change suggested by Andrew Morton to the 2.6.24-rc7
kernel patched with Nick Piggin's ticket spinlock patch.
These data indicate that there is a small performance penalty (1-2%)
incurred when adding ticket spinlocks alone, probably because they are
not used enough in the kernel to reap the performance benefits of the
implementation cost.  By allowing the lock to be released and
reacquired under contention in just these two places, the 1-2%
overhead of ticket spin performance is reclaimed in most benchmarks,
making overall performance comparable to the baseline kernel.
The only data inconsistent with these results are the kernel
compilation benchmarks.  These data indicate that the best performance
is from the baseline kernel.  It is not clear to me what property of
kernel compilation causes it to have this performance profile.
Placing the zone spin lock in its own cache line hurts performance.
The dd regression test actually shows a similar trend to the other
benchmarks; ticket spinlocks + my patch perform best.
Thanks for your comments and consideration,
Don Porter
