This is not directly on subject, but I'm hoping there will be some folks here
interested in an Open Source for Open Telecom initiative that started last
week. If not, my apologies...
The project web site is www.opentelecom.org .  The focus is on developer's of
telecom equipment.  We have source code for telecom circuit switching within
PCs and CompactPCI industrial computers, plus the hot swap software
infrastructure to support live insertion and removal of cards in a CompactPCI
chassis.  The web site has working source code for NT, Solaris and SCO
Unixware.  A project to support Linux is underway.

If you know of anyone who might be interested, please pass the word.
Thank you.
