Gidday,
I just released man-pages-2.59 and man-pages-2.60.
These releases are now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
and soon at:
    
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
These releases consist primarily of editorial changes, the
most notable being that man-pages is now standardized on
American spelling.  Formerly, different pages (and sometimes
even a single page!) employed American and British spelling
conventions (best to standardize on one spelling, and
American English is the standard in Computer Science).
Cheers,
Michael
