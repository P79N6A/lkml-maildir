Automatic resync code was added at the beginning of 2.6.16 and although it
generally works quite well and usually resolves problems caused by KVMs
resetting mice ther were several reports of it breaking existing setups.
Unfortunately I did not have anough time to resolve the issues in time
for 2.6.16 final and so I think it is the best to disable new code by
default for now. I do not want to revert the changes completely as they
are still useful.
Hope this helps.
