Hi to all,
I've got glibc-2.06 from gnu ftp server and I want to recompile and install
the
library on my debian 2.0 system.
Ok you can say, debian is just a glibc system, but neverthless I'd like to
do this crazy thing.
What cautions and which steps I must take care in doing it.
TIA,
        Davide Libenzi.
