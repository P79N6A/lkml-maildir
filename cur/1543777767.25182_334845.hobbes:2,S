What exactly would be slowed down?
It would just move around some code and even avoid the overwrite mode 
check.

The point is to design a simple and flexible relayfs layer, which means 
not every possible function has to be done in the relayfs layer, as long 
it's flexible enough to build additional functionality on top of it (for 
which it can again provide some library functions).
