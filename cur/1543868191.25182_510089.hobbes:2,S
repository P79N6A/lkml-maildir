The patch, the way it's written now -- is the default to build with
swap-prefetch, or build without by default? If the former, maybe it
would be more accepted if the latter was the default. (Of course, that
defeats the point for desktop users who add the patch and then wonder
why it doesn't work, but... *shrugs*)

While I'm all for putting Con's patches into mainline, I'm worried
about what happens if you rip swap prefetch apart and (if the
unthinkable happens) somebody accidentally omits something or worse.
Then mainline would have even more reason to be suspicious of code
from you, Con. Unless you already ripped the swap prefetch patch into
the parts that mm-filesize_dependant_lru_cache_add.patch depend on and
the parts it doesn't, and check it's "sane" to use them
independently...
(I'd be WAY more suspicious of having "half" of swap prefetch than
having all of it. I hope that most of mainline agrees with me, but I
have a sneaking suspicion they don't.)
In any case, this "ripping"... would it make the reverse happen? i.e.
swap prefetch being dependent on
mm-filesize_dependant_lru_cache_add.patch instead?
