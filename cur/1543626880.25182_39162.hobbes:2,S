Subject: Extraversion in System.map?

As part of my penance for using the wrong System.map file in the
readprofile data I sent out, I have prepared a patch to readprofile
that makes it check the version of the file against the kernel.
Much to my dismay, the extraversion code ('-pre6' for example) does
not appear to be anywhere in System.map.  Or am I wrong?  If not, why
not, and can this be fixed?  After all, symbols can and do change
between -pre versions.
