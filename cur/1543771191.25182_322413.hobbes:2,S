Did you publish something about it (so that people won't have to do it
over and over again)?

So I wonder why it doesn't do that and it leaves local_irq_disable
uncovered making it a "metal hard" instead of "ruby hard" like rtai.
Why should preempt-RT leave any driver out there capable of breaking the
RT guarantee when it can simply redefine local_irq_disable too like
rtlinux? That sounds just wrong.
I'm talking about this:
#define local_irq_disable()    do { __asm__ __volatile__("cli": :
:"memory"); trace_irqs_off(); } while (0)
Why is the "cli" still there and capable of breaking the hard-RT every
time a driver (out of the kernel, whatever kernel module) calls it?
The software (and not hardware) local_irq_disable is the fundamental
piece of the "ruby hard" RT-guarantee. Be it done like in rtlinux, or
with a nanokernel hypervisor like in RTAI.
I don't get why preempt-RT doesn't fix this _last_ bit too to become a
"ruby hard" solution fully equivalent to RTAI and rtlinux.
Perhaps that's planned and not yet implemented?
