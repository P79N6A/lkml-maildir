To be sure it is not possible to modify original tree files, I do
chown -R root.root original_tree
before copying it (via cp -lR) to new one, which will be modified with
whatever tools by me, logged in as a regular user. For those having root
access to a box this might be a useful way of preventing accidents ...
(this of course also assumes sane file permissions)
