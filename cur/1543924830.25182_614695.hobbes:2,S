There's another ugly bit in the current implementation.
Right now, we would have to have every PCI vendor/device ID pair in the 
virtio PCI driver ID table for every virtio device.
This means every time a virtio device is added to Linux, the virtio PCI 
driver has to be modified (assuming that each virtio device uses a 
unique PCI vendor/device ID) :-/
