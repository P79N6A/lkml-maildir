Hello,
Quick question: does anybody here know of a good _online_ reference for
BSD sockets in the kernel?? I'm trying to learn how to implement a
"raw" network point-to-point interface (i.e. no protocols, just data), but
I'm having trouble understanding what I need to change or do.
I already have a driver that works with AF_INET (IP), and now I'd like to
be able to configure it so that a user can open a socket and write raw
data to it.
Any pointers are highly appreciated.
Later,
Ivan
