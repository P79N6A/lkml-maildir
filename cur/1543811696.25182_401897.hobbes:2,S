For system-critical bits of userspace I think this makes a lot
of sense for another reason: Code review.   Userspace code doesn't
get anywhere near the scrutiny that kernel code gets.
We still allow the occasional crap into the kernel that probably
could have used another trip around the block before merging, but
the barrier to entry for new code is a lot higher than it used
to be a few years ago.
Moving stuff out to userspace is a 'get out of jail' card for a lot
of authors, but if we're all going to be relying on that code
doing the right thing, it should get an equal amount of code review.
