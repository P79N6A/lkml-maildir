No, the reverse is true: when a task is chosen for oom kill based on the 
badness heuristic, the oom killer first attempts to kill any child task 
that isn't attached to the same mm.  If the child shares an mm, both tasks 
must die before memory freeing can occur.

It's an inappropriate addition since /proc/pid/oom_adj scores exist which 
can prefer or protect certain tasks over others when the oom killer 
chooses a target, including oom kill immunity.  These scores are inherited 
from parent tasks and can be tuned after the fork to your oom kill target 
preference.
