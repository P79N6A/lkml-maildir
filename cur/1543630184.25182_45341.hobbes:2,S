Got these errors while compiling:

found a few other problems:
1) the pio fix posted last week is not included in your tree or Linus' and
I found this the hard way: severe filesystem damage and system lockup and a
kernel (2.4.19-pre8) panic because the root partition could not be mounted
(as reported before). 
The following patch fixes this, apllies with an offset of -2 lines:

-- end patch --
2) After boot the system is not responsive to the keyboard, logging in via
ssh and doing a `insmod psmouse` followed by a `rmmod psmouse` results in a
working keyboard...
before and after insmod there is no interrupt 1 listed in /proc/interrupts,
but after doing the rmmod it is listed: "  1:         52          XT-PIC
i8042"
the mouse interrupt is listed as " 12:        154          XT-PIC  i8042"
the following message was issued after `rmmod psmouse`: "input: AT Set 2
keyboard on isa0060/serio0"
After applying the pio-fix I was able to run both 2.5.13-dj2 and 2.5.14-dj1
for three days on this system (p100, 48MB, 2x IDE-hd) without
ext2-filesystem corruption or lockups!!
2.5.14-dj2 is now running for 4 hours and I am going to stress-test it :-)
