Bear in mind that people are trying to lock down Linux with serious
security, such as mandatory access control. The Coda filesystem
developers seem to want each login to be isolated from every other.
Perfect matches are very reliable. Anything less is likely to
allow mistakes.

I highly doubt that root will want to steal core dumps.
For embedded systems, non-root simply won't run a crash handler.
In any case, "chmod 600 /dev/crash" if you want to steal cores.
It is more likely that root will be too lazy to run the daemon.
I'd hate to rely on certain admins I know.

Yes, that would be a mess. Don't do that.

That logic does not belong anywhere. It is overly complex.
This is simple:
1. Look for an exact security match.
2. If none, look for root.
3. If not found, dump core.
Step 2 is really for setuid programs and servers that change UID.
It is not intended to catch normal user processes. In fact, it
should just dump a standard core if it catches one by accident.
