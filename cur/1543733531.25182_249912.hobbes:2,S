Ok, thanks. Do you see anything else that needs fixing? The code the patch 
below removes has hidden this bug, so there could be other serious bugs (and 
by serious I mean Oopses or data loss).
Known issues:
- need to port to BIOs (a bit hard because I need first to understand the 
request mangling - see cowify_req. The code idea is to redirect each sector 
independently either to the UBD backing file or to the COW file. COW stand 
for Copy On Write: it allows to have the UBD read only and a COW file 
containing just the changes).
- Uml SMP support does not compile from sometimes so spinlocking is broken in 
ubd_finish (only in some cases - when called by do_ubd_request and thread_fd 
== -1). To see this, add ubd=sync on command line and turn spinlock debugging 
on.
