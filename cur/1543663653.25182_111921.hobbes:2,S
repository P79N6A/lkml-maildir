I would call a 15% lead over the ia64 pretty substantial.
yes it's not the same clock speed, but if that's the clock speed they can
achieve on that process it's equivalent. the P4 covers a LOT of sins by
ratcheting up it's speed, what matters is the final capability, not the
capability/clock (if capability/clock was what mattered the AMD chips
would have put intel out of business and the P4 would be as common as
ia-64)
