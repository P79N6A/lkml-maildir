There is this growing (think growing as in "fungus") set of thinking
that just because something can be misused, this is an argument
against it even existing.
I think this is wrong.  I'm seeing it a lot, especially on this list,
and it's becomming a real concern at least to me.
Most of the time the argument goes like:
1: "Well, we allow this because you can do usefull things X Y and
    Z as a result."
2: "Yeah, but this also lets you do stupid things like A B and
    C."
   translation: "It hurts when I do A B or C"
Most people know the appropriate response for the translation of
#2 ;-)
