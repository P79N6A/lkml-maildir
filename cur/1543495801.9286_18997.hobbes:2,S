The subject says it all - and I'm sure someone has done it....
I'm looking for two items.
1. The drivers for, or specs so I can write a driver for, the code needed to
monitor things like fan speed, motherboard temp, etc.
2. Sources for a dual 100BT Ethernet board and driver for Linux.  I'm
running out of PCI slots here!
Many thanks for any help you can provide.
