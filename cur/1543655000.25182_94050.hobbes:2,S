I will argue not on the frequency of calls but on the preciousness of
space; highmem feels very serious pain when internal fragmentation
of pinned pages occurs (which this is designed to prevent). I don't
have direct experience with this patch/API, but I can say that
fragmentation in ZONE_NORMAL is deadly (witness pagetable occupancy
vs. ZONE_NORMAL consumption, which motivated highpte, despite my
pagetable reclamation smoke blowing).
