every article i have read (an agreed with) on operating system internals,
has stated that the goto is considered taboo in C... _except_ in operating
system code where speed is critical, and goto can increase readability.
i taught myself how to program by single stepping through assembly
code on a DOS machine. i have found that too much structure leads
not to modular code that is easy to maintain, but a nightmare of
conditionals that cause your head to throb trying to trace the state
of an execution. being that i am partial to assembly, perhaps i am
biased in the matter.
