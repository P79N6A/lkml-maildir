yesterday I flashed a new BIOS into the abit BP6, equipped with two 466 MHz
Celerons, in order to have power-on after a power failure.
I also run 2.2.14pre9-smp (and 2.2.13-up for eventual recovery).
a few things didn't go well.
1) I had to force linux with append mem=256 MB to get all memory
   detected, the old BIOS version didn't.
what can I tell abit ? what did they do "wrong" ?
2) I see this in the dmesg :
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent fixed MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
same question, what do they do "wrong"..
3) I see this in the dmesg :
Intel MultiProcessor Specification v1.1
while the BIOS is set at MPS rev 1.4. Are these entries related or not ?
I ask these questions in order to be able to ask abit to fix eventual BIOS
problems.
