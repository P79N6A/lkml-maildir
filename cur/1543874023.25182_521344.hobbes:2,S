I think it would be better to replace it with a wrapper
that forces O_DIRECT and opens the underlying block device.  I suspect 
just dropping it will break many people's database setups, which is not
nice.  Widely used admin interfaces should be only broken when 
there is a very good reason and just "there is a better way now" 
doesn't seem quite strong enough.
