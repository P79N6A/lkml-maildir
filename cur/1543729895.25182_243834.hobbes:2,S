Here is a latency trace generated by the NFS compile in the
stress-kernel. It is ~1.7 ms which doesn't really surprise me for the
NFS compile. I am going to take the NFS compile out of the test now and
see what else falls out.
If it would be useful for me to provide additional information with
this, please let me know.
