   Here's a patch, avoiding useless access.
This seems like a large ugly hack.
Why not make sure in the user tools that the argument is properly
aligned to 4 bytes?
IP-chains works fine on Alpha and Sparc which have the same alignment
restrictions as Super-H for loading 4-byte values.  Thus why is SH so
special and require this ugly hack?
I would really like to see specific examples of the failure before I
consider this issue further.
Later,
