One day hopefully this will be sorted in the BIOSes and in mainline. I
keep having to patch for every release (although as thats the only patch
I have to do I'm sure there are many worse off than me). I use the 3com
n/w on my A7N8X Deluxe v2 BIOS 1007 so no need for nforcedeth.
Best patches are at:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/21/7
Ive applied them to 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 and give no crashes and no heat
issues.
 (XP2600+ runs at 31/32C normal use and 38C compiling with Zalman cooler
+exhaust fans in box)
