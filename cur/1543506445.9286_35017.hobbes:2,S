nothing. To calc such information we should do a O(N) algorithm scanning
all the mem_map array. Now si_meminfo runs in O(1). You have less
information but after all the shared counter is just been screwed up by
the page-buffer cache unification of 2.3.x since most page-cache pages now
have the page count > 1 even if they live in cache (and they are not
mapped in userspace memory).
I am not the author of such change but I sure agree with it. (for
debugging you have the shared information in SYSRQ+M, SYSRQ+M runs in O(N)
as usual of course ;).
