Andrew,
I looked at this few days ago. I am not sure how we end up having 
multiple pages (especially,
why we end up having buffers with bh_size > pagesize) ? Do you know why ?
Easiest fix would be to fix submit_bh() to deal with multiple vecs - 
which is vetoed by
Jens and I agree with him :(
Thanks,
Badari
