The following works:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <linux/cdrom.h>
int main () {
	int file;
	int stats;
	if((file = open("/dev/hdd", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK)) < 0)
        {
            fprintf(stderr,"No such device\n");
            return 0;
        }
	ioctl(file, CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY, & stats);
	if (stats & CDC_SELECT_DISC)
	   printf("Success!\n");
	else
	   printf("<DOH!> Something went wrong\n");
	return 0;
	}
