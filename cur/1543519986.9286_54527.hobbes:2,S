I believe you are saying the same thing.  Scrolling is one of the problems
where this really looks wacky.  I don't believe this is the correct
behavior, or at least, is not the same behavior as a VT420 or relisys
terminal have (the only two color terminals I use).

Likewise, is gibberish to me as well.  I would mail this to the maintainer
but I only see a maintainer listed for SVGA not for the console code.
