NX protection for kernel-space overflows on x86 has been part of the
mainline kernel as of June 2004 (released in 2.6.8), on CPUs that
support the NX bit - i.e. latest AMD and Intel CPUs. Let me quote from
the commit log:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1757.49.12
  [...]
  furthermore, the patch also implements 'NX protection' for kernelspace
  code: only the kernel code and modules are executable - so even
  kernel-space overflows are harder (in some cases, impossible) to
  exploit. Here is how kernel code that tries to execute off the stack is
  stopped:
   kernel tried to access NX-protected page - exploit attempt? (uid: 500)
   Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address f78d0f40
    printing eip:
   ...
implemented, split out and brought to you by yours truly, as part
of the exec-shield project. (You know, the one not developed by that 
'scheduler developer' ;-)
