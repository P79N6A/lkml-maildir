Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.3 Posix scheduling violation for !SCHED_OTHER
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
 The following fixes a problem where a SCHED_FIFO task would on occasion
be moved to the end of its runqueue when returned to from a preemption.
Cause was do to some SCHED_OTHER code in schedule() which was being
run for tasks of every policy.
Regards,
Joe
