What about cases like the pci device list or any other such list. Sometimes
you do not care if somebody added something, while you were looking through
the list as long as you do not get illegal addresses or data.
Wouldn't this be very useful there? Most of these lists come up
at system startup and change rearly, but we look through them often.
Me too, Did I miss something?
