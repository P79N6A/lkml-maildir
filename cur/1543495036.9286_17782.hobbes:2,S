Greg,
	For the record, I have been doing my performance tests on "strobe"
runs of SPECWeb96.  This is a somewhat representative subset of the entire 
suite.  It runs much shorter than a full SPECWeb96 run.  It allows one to
quickly figure what is happening in the system, and is ideal for performance
tuning. 
I haven't yet tried  a full run with Greg's changes, but on the strobe runs, 
things do get better.  Response time descreases and the maximum number of Ops 
increases.  (Both very good signs.)  
I'll try a full run shortly.
