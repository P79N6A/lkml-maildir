The sole reason for fiddling with the VMA is that we try to optimize
icache flushing for non-VM_EXEC vmas.  This optimization is broken
as the MIPS hardware doesn't make a difference between read and execute
in page permissions, so the icache might be dirty even though the vma
has no exec permission.  So I'll have to re-implement this whole things
anyway.  The other problem is an efficience problem.  A call like
flush_cache_range(some_mm_ptr, 0, TASK_SIZE) would take a minor eternity
and for MIPS64 a full eternity ...
