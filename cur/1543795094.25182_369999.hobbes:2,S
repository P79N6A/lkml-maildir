Now that you mention it:
In my case, I've been getting 6 serial ports reported at boot time
for most of the 2.6.x kernel series.  They are just repeats of ttyS0 and
ttyS1, including the ttyS0/1 designation.
From my last dmesg while booting 2.6.14.2:
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 2 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
I had posted about this before, but it was apparently lost in the lists
general noise.   I do use both ports here, and they are working, so I
hadn't pursued it further.
