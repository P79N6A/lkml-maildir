Now that it's gone into the tree, I look at it and wonder, does your
nid_lock really serve any purpose?  We're just doing a simple assignment
to prev_nid, and it doesn't matter if occasionally two racers choose the
same node, and there's no protection here against a node being offlined
before the alloc_pages_node anyway (unsupported? I'm ignorant).
