Hmm, I'll take a look, but I don't really think it is a problem of the 
recording programme, otherwise how could my reader read it out completely?

No, it uses atapi as a) it claims to be compatible with it and b) I have 
neither activated scsi nor scsi-emulation in the kernel, so it most 
probably is a new issue. Furthermore my hd reading (I once contacted you 
because of that) didn't improve with the new kernel, though some 
bugfixes in this directions are mentioned by Andrew Morton.
