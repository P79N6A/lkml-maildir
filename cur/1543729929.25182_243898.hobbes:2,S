Unfortunately the driver allocates 0x40-0x5f as can be seen in 
/proc/ioports:
0040-005f : timer
I do not know which file contains this allocation so I haven't been able 
to change it. Any ideas?

The device is a SD/MMC card reader which is indeed an LPC device. The 
ports in question are needed to identify the chip and determine which 
resources it has. Actual usage is done on higher ports.
