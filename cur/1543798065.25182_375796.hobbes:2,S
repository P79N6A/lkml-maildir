That would impress me too, if I could do that.
I think that is well beyond my humble capabilities.
The sed/perl script to make the textual change should be practical.
Indeed, I would claim that the initial big patch -should- be done
that way.  Keep refining a sed script until manual inspection and
trial builds of all arch's, allconfig, show that it seems to be right.
Each time you find an error doing this, don't manually edit the
kernel source; rather refine the script and try applying it again.
