Thanks for the reply. But my concern is user convenience in _average_
here. Basically, I want the 99% of users that cannot afford neither need
nor want PCI hotplug to have their system just dead in order to make happy
the 1%.
In other word, I donnot care about this 1% if it makes run a tiny risk to
the 99% to get inconvenience a single second. Btw, I am among the 99%.
