It should probably go into a seperate file below Documentation/.

Does it make sense to support more than one card or a non-default port
address?  I.e., is there any card using an OPL2/3 that we do not have a
driver for (except the AdLib FM)?
I think at least the port address for the first card should be defaulted
to 0x388.
