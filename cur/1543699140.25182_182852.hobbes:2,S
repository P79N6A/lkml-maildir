Yeh, it uses code. But if you look into a MAKEDEV bases file system, you see
hundreds of device files. Which uses inode and directory space on the
medium, may it be e2fs or jffs2.
I did not measure if the code for devfs is smaller as the code+config files
for udev. But I didn't make a statement about this.

"Embedded" is not automatically a washing maschine with only 5 entries, it
can be a full blown Linux computer with 400 MHz, Framebuffer, USB Host, USB
Client, 7 serial ports for GSM, Barcode Scanner, Whatever, and so on. Like
our device.
However, even on such hardware-rich devices you usually have a constraint on
Flash Memory size. So having things small & simple is nice. That makes room
for the user applications & data.
