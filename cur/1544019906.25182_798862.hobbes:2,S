Hi Yinghai!
   Indeed; Mike, that contained a bad conversion of 
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/powernow-k8.c.
   This patch reverts the bad change (this code should still be converted
to work_on_cpu of course, but that's a bigger change).
   Yinghai, as far as I can tell your other fixes are independent (and
were a problem before this commit, yes?).  Can you re-submit them on top
of this patch (which is for Ingo, but against latest Linus).

Impact: fix powernow-k8 when acpi=off (or other error).
There was a spurious change introduced into powernow-k8 in this patch:
the cause if that we try to "restore" the cpus_allowed we never saved.
See lkml "[PATCH] x86/powernow: fix cpus_allowed brokage when
acpi=off" from Yinghai for the bug report.
