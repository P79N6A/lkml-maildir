Hi all,
I am trying to learn more in operation of kernel, and decided to attempt some 
small hacks with a meaningful purpose - 'see it in action' type stuff rather 
than just play.
One area to start with I decided is the keyboard warning at boot.  I have 5 
headless/keyboardless boxes and wish the kernel to stop reporting I have no 
keyboard at boot(I KNOW!!).
I finally located where kb gets initialized.
Is it this simple just to undef this in /include/linux/pc_keyb.h
#define KBD_REPORT_TIMEOUTS             /* Report keyboard timeouts */
I have read code through, and it appears the right thing to do (and it's so 
simple I am in doubt it is this easy), but I am loath to try it in case the 
box doesn't come up and I will have to fart around getting out monitor and kb 
and move my sofa for access and stuff...
Thanks for any help.
Nick
