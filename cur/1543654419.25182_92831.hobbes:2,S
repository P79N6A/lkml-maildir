Personally, I use 2.4-ac which includes rmap, the O(1) scheduler, and a
couple performance tweaks like read-latency and irq balancing.
But I have seen some excellent numbers from 2.4-aa, so you may want to
try that out, especially now that Andrea has the O(1) scheduler in
there.  2.4-aa has a large collection of performance patches.  Andrew
Morton says that is the best performing 2.4 kernel he has seen.
Your best bet is 2.6 when it comes out :)
