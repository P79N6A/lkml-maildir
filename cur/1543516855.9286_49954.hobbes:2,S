It handles partially in user space.  For lookups it is easy: you look up
in the top layer before passing the request down, and if you see a
whiteout directory entry (indicating the file has been deleted in the
top layer but is still there underneath), you return ENOENT.
For readdir(), the entire directory stream for all layers in order is
passed up to libc, which then removes duplicates.  That's a little
gross, but it is a lot less gross than most of the possible in-kernel
alternatives.  It's a reasonable way to do it.
