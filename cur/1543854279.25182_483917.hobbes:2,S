Cool.  That shows potential.  On an 2.6.19-rc6-rt4 kernel, it looked
like it _might_ have eventually gotten past boot.  At one line of kernel
output every ~10 seconds though, I gave up.  Virgin 2.6.19-rc6 went
panic with a black screen... have options, will tinker.
(i _was_ quite content with swsusp, but now i want it all;)
	Thanks,
