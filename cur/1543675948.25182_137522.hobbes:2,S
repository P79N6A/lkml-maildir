First, this doesn't do any harm since CONFIG_IPV6_SCTP__ alone doensn't 
result in anything getting compiled.
But besides, it seems a bit broken.
From net/sctp/Kconfig:
<--  snip  -->
...
config IPV6_SCTP__
        tristate
        default y if IPV6=n
        default IPV6 if IPV6
config IP_SCTP
        tristate "The SCTP Protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on IPV6_SCTP__
...
<--  snip  -->
Semantically equivalent is the following for IPV6_SCTP__:
config IPV6_SCTP__
        tristate
        default y if IPV6=n || IPV6=y
	default m if IPV6=m
If it was intended to disallow a static IP_SCTP with a modular IPV6 it 
doesn't work: It's perfectly allowed to set IPV6=n and IP_SCTP=y and 
later compile and install a modular IPV6 for the same kernel.
Could someone from the SCTP developers comment on the intentions behind 
IPV6_SCTP__ ?
