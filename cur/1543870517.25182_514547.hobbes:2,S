Virtualization in general. We don't know what it is - in IBM machines it's 
a hypervisor. With Xen and VMware, it's usually a hypervisor too. With 
KVM, it's obviously a host Linux kernel/user-process combination.
The point being that in the guests, hotunplug is almost useless (for 
bigger ranges), and we're much better off just telling the virtualization 
hosts on a per-page level whether we care about a page or not, than to 
worry about fragmentation.
And in hosts, we usually don't care EITHER, since it's usually done in a 
hypervisor.

.. but this has again no impact on anti-fragmentation.
In other words, I really don't see a huge upside. I see *lots* of 
downsides, but upsides? Not so much. Almost everybody who wants unplug 
wants virtualization, and right now none of the "big virtualization" 
people would want to have kernel-level anti-fragmentation anyway sicne 
they'd need to do it on their own.
