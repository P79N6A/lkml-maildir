It's a driver problem somewhere.  Probably not one of the most common 
drivers because I don't see the same problem here (but then I'm not 
testing -mm).
The thing to do is figure out which driver is causing the problem.
Jiri, try enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER.  If there's also a config 
option to prevent the console from being suspended, set it as well.  
Then you should be able to tell which driver is making trouble.
