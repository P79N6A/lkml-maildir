No, ->special is for the driver receiving the request, I don't know what
kind of bastard driver you are trying to create :-). If you pass it on,
you cannot use it.
But your code just using the after-last bit is still severly broken, you
must not play tricks like that.
Actually, sounds like you are attempting to create an io stack at the
wrong level. Why aren't you just hooking into ->make_request_fn()
instead? You are in for all sorts of pains doing what you describe
above.
