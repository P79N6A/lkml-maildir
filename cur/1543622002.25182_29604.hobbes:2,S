You do have a point, because there is a small change that a
configuration symbol can be auto-enabled without prompting.
This is more just standard Unix pragmatism, treating auto-remove
operations with far more caution than auto-enable operations, precisely
for cases like the example one above.  Only when one has pretty much
complete control of environment do you want to make the assumption that
a 'remove' op is the perfect complement of the 'add' op.
