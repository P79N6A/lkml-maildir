  After getting my audio recording working again, I seem to have run into
another problem.  Recording stereo 16bit 44100Hz wav files from my
Soundblaster Vibra/16 PnP on my Pentium 120MHz to my DMA-enabled
write-cached interrupt-unmasked PCI-bus-mastering EIDE hard disk seems to
have lost usable performance.  My syslog is filling with "Recording
overrun" messages.  This appears to be completely unrelated to my sb_audio
fix.  Normally I only see these messages if I do major activity during the
recording, like running something that has been partially pushed into
swap.  Last time I did a bunch of audio recording was with kernel 2.1.131,
and I think once with 2.1.132.  I run wavrec with a high priority but
there's nothing running in the background anyway.
