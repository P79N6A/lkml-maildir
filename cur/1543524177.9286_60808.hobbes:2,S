You say that, but the really ironic thing is I once compiled some code
with labelled initialisers and the compiler really _did_ just ignore the
labels.  No warnings.
That was one really hard bug to track down, grr...
Details: G++ accepted the syntax but ignored it, so everything compiled
fine but to the wrong code.  I don't know what G++ does now.
enjoy,
