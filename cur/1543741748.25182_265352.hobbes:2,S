The goal of -ac is to contain the stuff I personally consider important.
A lot of the smaller bugfixes individually are fine but a 'complete set
of bugfixes' turns into a large change set and then needs an entire
validation and release cycle of its own.
Each 2.6.10rc change I merged is on the basis of reward >> risk.
I don't care if its 2.6.9-ac or 2.6.9.4 personally but it's for Linus to
decide if he wants to do that and who he wants to make keeper of the
2.6.x.y tree if anyone.
