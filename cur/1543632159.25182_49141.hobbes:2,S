Please start by writing a reassembler extension for objdump.
Or just psersuade the nvida people to provide assembler output
files for the parts they would like to preserve closed source.
This would:
1. Still not unveal any information they wan't to disclosure in a trivial
way (the disclosured information would be 100% equivalent.
2. Allow to adjust the code for kernel API changes.
3. They could claim they code it in assembler for performance reasons
and wouldn't therefore get that much unsolicited heat.
