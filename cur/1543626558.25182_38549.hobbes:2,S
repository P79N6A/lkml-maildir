A have some thoughts but nothing to concrete right now.  On every architecture
booting seems to be a completely roll your own solution.  Which I find
very annoying.  This one of the reasons I am also working on general
linux booting linux support.  If we could get as far as a bootloader
that works on multiple architectures perhaps we could start to unify
some of these things.

I think most of the cleanup has been done.  But reducing the number of
copies of zlib was work that someone was doing recently.

I really don't know about compiled in command lines.  To me they have
most value when you can take an external utility and edit the command
line that is compiled into the kernel.
