Hi Mingming,
It looks OK to me, but you might want to strip out the now redundant
i_version updates in add_dirent_to_buf(), ext4_rmdir(), ext4_rename().
I also have some questions about how this will affect the readdir code:
unless I missed something, the filp->f_version is still unsigned long,
so the comparisons and assignments in ext4_readdir()/ext4_dx_readdir()
no longer make sense.
Cheers
  Trond
