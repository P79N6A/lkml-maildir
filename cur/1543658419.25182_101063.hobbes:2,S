On ARM, it doesn't appear under "processor options" but under
"General Setup", which is where it fits best, along with the other
general core features of the kernel.  It does depend on a processor
option, but there should not be any problem with that.  ARM _does
not_ support preempt on 26-bit ARM CPUs, so we _explicitly_ disallow
selection of that configuration.
