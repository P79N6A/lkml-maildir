We do "crap like this" because x86 did, and people wanted to set these
parameters at boot time, and in the old days of Linux (eg, 2.0), these
parameters were never available as command line arguments.  So the only
way to set them from boot loaders via architecture code is for architecture
code to reference the variable directly.
It looks like things have moved on in x86 land, but because there's an
utter lack of communication about these changes, the "planned obsolescence"
of rd_size hasn't been noticed.  So, I recommend that we keep rd_size
visible and take it through the now established feature-removal cycle,
including issuing kernel warnings about it if it gets used.
