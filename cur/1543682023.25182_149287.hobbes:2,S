Subject: typecast bug in sched.c bites reschedule_idle on alpha
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On SMP Alpha, a saturated system (with one busy userland process per
CPU) becomes almost completely unusable.  The busy loops don't have to
be doing anything more complicated than "while(1) ;".  The symptom is
that even logging into the system (with ssh) takes on the order of 30
seconds.  (Tested on an ES40 with 4 processors, 2.4.18.)
It turns out that the problem is in kernel/schedule.c:reschedule_idle.
        cycles_t oldest_idle;
...
        oldest_idle = (cycles_t) -1;
...
                        if (oldest_idle == -1ULL) {
Since asm-alpha/timex.h defines cycles_t as unsigned int, this
comparison is always false.  Changing it to (cycles_t)-1 fixes the
problem.
Patch below.  I'd like this to go into 2.4.22, if nobody has a problem
with that.  I would like confirmation from other eyes -- this patch
doesn't break semantics on any architecture, does it?
