Subject: [PATCH 2/4] jiffies: Add 64bit jiffies compares (for use with get_jiffies_64)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/21/297

The current time_before/time_after macros will fail typechecks
when passed u64 values (as returned by get_jiffies_64()). On 64bit
systems, this will just result in a warning about mismatching types
without explicit casts, but since unsigned long and u64
(unsigned long long) are of same size, it will still work.
On 32bit systems, a long is 32bits, so the value from get_jiffies_64()
will be truncated by the cast and thus lose all the precision gained by
64bit jiffies.
