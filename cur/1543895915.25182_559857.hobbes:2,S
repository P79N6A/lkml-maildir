Yup.  That's the law.
At which point it's not the hardware vendor imposing the restriction,
so this use is perfectly acceptable.
One could presumably implement similar seals in software.  Nothing
wrong with a signature used to indicate that the device has been
tampered with.  Even a led somewhere that reflects this status.
None of this prevents the user from enjoying the freedoms he's
entitled to, according to the laws of the place where he lives.
