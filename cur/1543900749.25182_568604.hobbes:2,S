I know nothing about that ancient stuff, but I've to trust you on

The events I referred to happened well before Bill's effort.
I admit I also started having some doubt about the correctness of my
above statement when I read Hugh's patch dated Jul 2001 in the last
few days, I'm now uncertain when Hugh's effort started, probably many
months before he published his code.
Overall I definitely shooted myself in the foot ;), because 1) I don't
actually care that much about the attribution of the idea (I wrote it
only as a side note), 2) we're in open source intellectual property
destruction land anyway so it doesn't matter who had the
idea. Apologies.
The way I felt while writing that side note, was that the time has
come to do what we had planned a long time ago, I simply didn't care
too much if VAXen or other ancient OS had it working before, sorry.
