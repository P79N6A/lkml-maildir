Hi,
I played with an algorithm to avoid cycles when hardlinking
directories. Attached is an userland demo.
Drawbacks:
	- Each ancestor of the target directory must be accessed.
	- It malloc's an additional piece of memory per ancestor
Advantages:
	- It locks only one ancestor at a time
	- All locks are released after each processed ancestor
	- It uses it's own directory-specific lock. So it will not
	  conflict with an ordinary directory lookup.
	- It's non-recursive
