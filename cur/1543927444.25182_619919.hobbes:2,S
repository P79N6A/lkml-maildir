Well, if interrupts are disabled, then the preempt check will see it and
won't trigger the reschedule. On the other hand, if this code is called
when preemption is enabled, we can add important scheduler latencies by
not checking if a resched must be done at the end of this region.
So if we are so sure that interrupts are always disbled or that
preemption is already disabled when this function is called, why do we
disable preemption here at all ?
(this is not introduced by your patch, it just happens to be how the
code was before)
