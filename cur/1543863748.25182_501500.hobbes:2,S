I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything like that. I just happened  
to notice that the date of the bug report appeared to correlate  
pretty well with one of the solar flare events last month. I was  
really trying to share some information that just conceivably might  
have been related, based on the earlier messages in this thread  
regarding memory errors.
I don't normally follow solar activity. I have been looking into some  
system failures that happened last month. The systems had been  
running with all bus error detection enabled – the hardware set to  
spontaneously reboot on any uncorrectable error. Since our systems  
are redundant, performing a reset simply means that the redundant  
partner will take over, so the reset is the best way to be certain  
that there is no data corruption. I eventually recalled a radio  
report last month about a coronal mass ejection on the sun and how  
things might be disrupted here. I checked out www.spaceweather.com  
and found that December was a very active month, with three separate  
X-class flares. I have no way to conclude that the failures that I  
have seen were influenced by events on the sun, but it seems  
possible. Compared to our systems, most PCs and even much server- 
class hardware systems are likely to corrupt a bit just keep on going.
We'll never know if any of these things were correlated with the  
solar flares because they all seem to be one-off failures. I do find  
it interesting though. Our systems seem to be doing statistically  
better this month. What do you think?
