I swapped CPU, memory and kernel all at once which resolved the
fault, as I had a second failure after this and I had to resolve
the fault ASAP so I couldn't trouble-shoot changing things one by one.
I'll re-upgrade to 2.4.25 after the system has been stable for around
a week; the original CPU and memory have been placed in a test box and
have shown no faults running a memory tester for 24 hours but perhaps
it was just a seating issue on a component; I'll report back if there
are any problems after re-upgrading.
David.
