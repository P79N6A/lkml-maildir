Subject: [PATCH] reduce size of struct buffer_head on 64bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/15/156

Reduce size of buffer_head from 96 to 88 bytes on 64bit architectures by
putting b_count and b_size together. b_count will still be in the first
16 bytes on 32bit architectures, so 16 byte cacheline machines shouldnt
be affected.
With this change the number of objects per 4kB slab goes up from
40 to 44 on ppc64.
