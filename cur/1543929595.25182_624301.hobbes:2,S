I believe there is a good chance that may be another instance
of the regression caused by my "Avoid creating P2P prefetch
window for expansion ROMs" patch that was recently reported by
Jan Beulich.

You might want to try reverting my changes to see if the
problem disappears.
I am working on a better fix for the problem that the patch
was attempting to address but this is turning out to be much
more difficult than I expected.  If I don't have a solution
very soon I plan to publish a revert patch.

This is an interesting idea.  Could you elaborate?  As far
as I can tell, the kernel always tries to allocate memory
for expansion ROMs which it also exports to user level.
I have assumed that some drivers or user level apps may
need to access this space.  Is this not true?
If this is due to my change, sorry for the trouble.
Thanks,
Gary
