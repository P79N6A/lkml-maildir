Can we try harder please?  10 screenfuls of kernel threads in the ps
output is just irritating.
How about banning the use of work_on_cpu() from schedule_work()
handlers and then fixing that driver somehow?
What _is_ the bug anyway?  The only description we were given was
  Impact: remove potential clashes with generic kevent workqueue
  Annoyingly, some places we want to use work_on_cpu are already in
  workqueues.  As per Ingo's suggestion, we create a different
  workqueue for work_on_cpu.
which didn't bother telling anyone squat.
When was this bug added?  Was it added into that driver or was it due
to infrastructural changes?
