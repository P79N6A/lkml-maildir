Gidday,
I recently released man-pages-2.24, which can be found at the 
location listed in the .sig.
This release includes the following new manual pages:
get_kernel_syms.2 
create_module.2  
delete_module.2  
init_module.2    
query_module.2
    FSF / mtk (with assistance of Luc Van Oostenryck)
        man-pages finally gets pages for these system calls, several
        of which are obsolete in Linux 2.6.
        Took the old GPLed pages dated 1996 and made a number of
        clean-ups and minor additions.
The man-pages set contains sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of 
the manual pages.  These sections describe the following:
2: (Linux) system calls
3: (libc) library functions
4: Devices
5: File formats and protocols
7: Overview pages, conventions, etc.
As far as this list is concerned the most relevant parts are: 
all of sections 2 and 4, which describe kernel-userland interfaces; 
in section 5, the proc(5) manual page, which attempts (it's always 
catching up) to be a comprehensive description of /proc; and 
various pages in section 7, some of which are overview pages of 
kernel features (e.g., networking protocols).
This is a request to kernel developers: if you make a change 
to a kernel-userland interface, or observe a discrepancy 
between the manual pages and reality, would you please send 
me (at mtk-manpages@gmx.net ) one of the following 
(in decreasing order of preference):
1. An in-line "diff -u" patch with text changes for the 
   corresponding manual page.  (The most up-to-date version 
   of the manual pages can always be found at
   
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
 or
   
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
 .)
2. An email describing the changes, which I can then 
   integrate into the appropriate manual page.
3. A message alerting me that some part of the manual pages 
   does not correspond to reality.  Eventually, I will try to 
   remedy the situation.
Obviously, as we get further down this list, more of my time 
is required, and things may go slower, especially when the
changes concern some part of the kernel that I am ignorant 
about and I can't find someone to assist.
Cheers,
Michael
