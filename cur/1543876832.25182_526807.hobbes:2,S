Note that at least for PIO-based devices, there is nothing that says you 
can't implement PCI over another transport, if you wish.  It's really 
just a very simple RPC protocol.
DMA is trickier, as it makes the data appear into the address space of 
the guest in a way that is both device- and host-dependent (in the 
presence of PCI domains, IOMMU etc.)  There may be reason to avoid DMA 
for that reason.
