Oh that might be, however in my case the device is exclusivly locked, so it 
doesn't matter that much, since there can be only one writer.
To explain what it actually is, it's a driver to program a LCA chip, an 
userspace opens the device, writes the program for the LCA, and closes the 
device. The driver itself can not understand the file format transmitted 
trough it, and has so no chance to know where the supposed end of stream is 
until the userspace closes the device. At close() it let's the LCA go, and 
looks if it's starting up, if so it has accpeted it's program, if not the 
file was not a valid image or the LCA might be damaged, and this error 
condition should be signaled.
Programming a LCA simply works then from the shell like in example this:
$> cp my-lca-image /dev/lca || echo "LCA failure :("
Where cp fails if the lca has not accepted it's image.
flush() can also be called in middle of stream, and is not a good indication 
for an end of stream.

If this is would be really (always) true, wouldn't it at least be better to 
have the release() prototype with a void return value?
