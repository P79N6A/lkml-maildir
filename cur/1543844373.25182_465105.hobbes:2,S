I only did that because I saw it there and I assumed it the was the correct
thing to use and that's why I used it.

Well, it's difficult to say. I can't say which is the best method. If the
upstream kernel used RCU function in a task allocation or task struct reading
in the first place then call_rcu() would be a clear choice. However, I didn't
see it used in that way (I could be wrong) so I use the next closest thing that
seems reasonable which is the thread desched_thread(). It use it to avoid
overloading the sematics of call_rcu() to be anything other than a pure RCU
callback. I suggest talking to Esben an Paul about this to get their view on
the matter.
Either method, call_rcu or desched_thread does the trick outside of the
scheduler path and fixes the problem. It's your choice.
