Unless you plan to plug a ton of pci cards and run out of slots, do not
buy anything integrated. If something breaks, your entire box goes to hell,
instead of unplugging your sound card and sendin it to repair (or to trash...)
Do not know about Intel's mobos, but I like SuperMicro's. I have an oldie
(a P6DGU, 400GX, and it runs more stable than anything I have tested - well,
recently we bought some 370DLE with SeverWorks HE-LS and they look fine also).
Apart from the UDE UDMA issue with ServerWorks, nowadays I would reccommend
those, a SuperMicro with LE chipset. And I will never even look at a Via.
I have only suffered with them.

I do not follow the MHz war, but that sounds the latest-and-greatest-and-
heatsink-burning. Do you really need it ? Think of a one of those new
1.2-1.3GHz Tualatins. They look like halfway a PIII and a Xeon. Save money
on the processor and invest it on the mobo. I will tell you to look at
the cache amount, but nowadays processor manufacturers are trading MHz
for cache. Brute force instead of cleverness...

I have dealed with IBMs and Fujitsus. IBMs get my vote.
(btw, I think it's spelled 'cheeta', like the panthers...)

Those SuperMicro I talked about allow 2 (and perjaps 4) way interleaving
with DIMM (133). They run fast, very fast...

If you do not plan a very heavy 3D, a GeForce2MX400 is the best price-feature
rate. The highest of the low-end. I think they are changing it now for some
called Titanium.

A dual box will feel much more responsive for interactive work, even if the
processors are not too fast. I have 2 PII@400MHz (yes, PII, did not loose
a I), and the box runs smoother than some GHz boxes (well, some cheating
here, the PII have 512KB caches, not like newest processors that even drop
it to 128KB).
Happy Christmas gift...
