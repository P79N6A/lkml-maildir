For dentry name, we certainly could use "[address of inode]" instead 
of "[inode number]" to get unicity, but do we care ?
For st_ino values on pipefs and sockets, I doubt any user application would 
care. I never had to fstat() a socket fd. Of course it's a file descriptor, 
but all we really want to do with this kind of file descriptor is to call 
socket API.
And for some heavy loaded internet servers , the additional cost of 
insert/delete a node in a machine shared tree could be a problem.
Some weeks ago I suggested to not hash pipe/socket dentries in order to save 
some locked ops (see commits 304e61e6fbadec586dfe002b535f169a04248e49 & 
b3423415fbc2e5461605826317da1c8dbbf21f97 ), so obviously I prefer not adding 
another tree ops. However, pipe/sockets creation/destroy are probably not 
that frequent, so the 6% perf impact is not that big :)
