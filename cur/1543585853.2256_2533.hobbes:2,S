This is a troll, right? I mean, you wouldn't work for a company that
publishes such internal memos (and allows its employees to post in
into a public mailing list), would you?
If you're working for a company that considers one OS "more secure"
than another, your "security administrator" should really get a clue.
I mean, they all suck. Really, all of them. That's why they're OSes. ;-)
