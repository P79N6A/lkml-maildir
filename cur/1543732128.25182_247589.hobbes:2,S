This solves the problem with the random driver.  The worst latencies I
am seeing are in netif_receive_skb().  With netdev_max_backlog set to 8,
the worst is about 160 usecs:

http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.9-rc1-Q5#/var/www/2.6.9-rc1-Q5/trace3.txt
Setting netdev_max_backlog to 1 has no effect:

I would expect this one to scale with CPU speed, so this is pretty good
considering my relatively underpowered system.  I would imagine on a
fast UP system you would not see any latencies worse than 100 usecs.
