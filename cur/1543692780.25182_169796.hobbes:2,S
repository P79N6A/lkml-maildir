What, create a world-writable directory without sticky bit and then wonder
why everyone can remove files from there?
Would you mind posting the list of systems (with versions, preferably)
where that behaviour would *not* match v7, 2.xBSD, 4.xBSD and derivatives
(including SunOS 4), SunOS 5.5, SunOS 5.6, SunOS 5.7,  SunOS 5.8, Linux,
OSF/1, etc.?
In particular, I'm most curious about the exact version of "Sun Unix"
you claim to have tried that on.  That, and output of ls -ld on the
directory in question.

The sad thing being, that's one claim I do *not* doubt.  Lusers' ability
to avoid learning for years had stopped amazing me a long time ago...
