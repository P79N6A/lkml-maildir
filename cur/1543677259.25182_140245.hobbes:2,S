Greetings!
I am writing a kernel module for which I need to
access a file from within the module. I have source of
the same using normal open, read and close operations
already written.
My questions are
What is the best approach to do the same in kernel
module? 
Are there any constraints on maximum memory a module
can use.
Thanks in advance and apologies if I am at wrong
place.
Have a nice time,
Peter.
