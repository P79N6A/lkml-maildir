It was true on the IBM AT that I used to have, so it isn't a new
premise.

Can I suggest that you re-read what I wrote, as you have clearly
misunderstood it. For reference:
 1. When I said "Assuming that the returned value...", I was
    referring to the FUNCTION read_rtc() which is presumably
    aware of exactly how to index the specific RTC chip in
    the computer in question. If the chip matches your spec,
    then the read_rtc() function will be masking the MSB out
    anyway, so the function supplied will still work.
 2. Not all RTC chips have a single address byte, nor do they
    all share it in the manner you indicated. I have written
    software for one system whose RTC/CMOS chip had 1010 bytes
    of CMOS RAM in it, so I know they exist.

In EVERY case, the ONLY difference as far as the routine I presented
is concerned is that the details of the read_rtc() function would vary
dependant on the precice chip used. As far as the presented routine is
concerned, the ONLY change would be if chips with more than 32k of
address space were to be supported, when one would need to make the
variable limit an unsigned long int and raise the limit in the while
statement, and it would then be capable of handling them.

See my previous post dealing with that very point and how it can be
dealt with.

Since we're talking about booting the kernel here, that doesn't even
come close to being relevant.

Name one that does? The one used in the genuine IBM PC/AT didn't, and
all the early clones used the same chip, so you'll need to do more to
prove that claim than just make it...
