Hi,
i thought that backporting ide-cd to 2.6.24 would be self-contained but the
problem is that it pulls in changes made in the block layer (ll_rw_blk.c splitup)
and if i pull those also in the patch, i can't guarantee the stability of your
system. Besides, this turns pretty fast into a chained pulling which will result
into a subset of 2.6.25-rc1 applied ontop of your 2.6.24.1 kernel so the only
alternative is to wait after 2.6.25 has been released and tackle the problem then.
