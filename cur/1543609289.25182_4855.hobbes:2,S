Exactly, the reason I found the pagecache hash was too small was because
__find_page_nolock was one of the worst offenders when doing zero copy
web serving of a large dataset.

Yes you cant expect prefetch to help you when you use the data 10
instructions after you issue the prefetch. (ie walking the hash chain)
