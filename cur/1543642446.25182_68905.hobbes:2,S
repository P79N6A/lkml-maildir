I've been having problems with a few of our servers and I can't seem to find this 
problem mentioned anywhere else. All of the dual processor machines will not operate 
with greater than 512 megs of ram with the newer SMP kernels (2.4.7-10enterprise #1 
SMP). Two of the dual P3 1ghz machines crash after a few minutes, when the memory 
usage gets high enough, I presume. The errors they spit out vary, but its only when 
I go over 512megs of ram, and only on dual processor machines. I had a slightly 
different problem when I tried to set it up on a dual p2 266 machine, when I go over 
512 megs there, the system takes an hour to boot up, and everything crawls from 
there. I asked a friend of mine to try this newer kernel with his dual processor 
server, and he says the same thing (when I go over 512, it crashes). Has anybody had 
this problem? Is there a fix?
Regards,
Jeffrey Moss
