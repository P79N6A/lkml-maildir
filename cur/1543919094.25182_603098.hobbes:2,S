what occupying all my time now is to try to make fast and easy (text/tty)
user interface, based solely on TERM=linux capability. It is such, but
deep in ncurses/lxdialog wrappers. Having more flexible TUI without
all past stereotypes is the major point in making any progress for
flexible configuration interface. Remember, how blind `select` hurts.
It does due to UI limitations in first place, IMHO.

All syntax wars are over, now order is the second thing to achieve. Like
in x86 merge case, this is purely technical thing with a bit of manual
work after that. sed magic for (nearly any kind :) of textual processing
i can guarantee without (yet another) C (like fixdep.c, parts of
sumversion.c, etc.)

Since i try to do test driven development, it's more easy for me to
understand/fix/test today's things via making bits from scratch. Fresh
view can do more on debugging of the logic level also.
