Again, can't you move this out into sysfs in the block directory for the
different partitions?  Or do you have userspace programs that are
expecting the stat device node to be present and export this
information?

Can't you split the ctl device node up into 2 different ones?  One for
the interface command, and one for the discover command?  Any future
commands would use additional device nodes, you have a whole major
reserved, might as well take advantage of it :)
That way, you can reduce the ammount of parsing logic you have to do in
your driver.

This should be used in a MODULE_VERSION() declaration, instead of a
printk() line.

This is not used anywhere.

Ah, so close.  You dropped all of the typedefs, thank you.  But what's
with the capital letter in the structure name?  Just make it "aoehdr" or
"aoe_header" or something that doesn't have capital letters in it.
Same thing for all of your structure names.  A simple sed script should
fix them all up for you :)

Any reason why BUFFL_FAIL and DEVFL_UP are the same value?  It looks
like they can be used in the same variable right?
The class_simple stuff looked sane, nice job.
thanks,
