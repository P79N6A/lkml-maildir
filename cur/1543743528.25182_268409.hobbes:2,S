I _have_ a fast machine. Others don't. And quite frankly, even I tend to 
prioritize things like "nice and quiet" over absolute speed.

Sure it is. You're complaining that developers use old versions of gcc. 
They do so for a reason. Old versions of gcc are sometimes better. They 
are better in many ways.
Your "use new versions of gcc even if it is slower" argument doesn't make 
any _sense_. If the new versions aren't any better, why would you want to 
use them?
