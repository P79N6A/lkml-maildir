Yes, good point, I see what you mean in terms of impact. But the trade
off could come from shrink_active_list() which does
list_del(&page->lru)
if (!reclaim_mapped && other_conditions)
	list_add(&page->lru, &l_active);
...
In the case mentioned above, we would triple the cachlines when an area
is mapped/unmapped (which might be acceptable since it is a state change
for the page ;) ). In the trade-off I mentioned, it would happen
everytime reclaim is invoked and it has nothing to do with a page changing
state.
Did I miss something?
