You have two options (or more) on top of 2.6.10-rc2:
- 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10-rc2/2.6.10-rc2-mm2/2.6.10-rc2-mm2.bz2
- 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/2.6.10-rc2-netdev1.patch.bz2
Once you have applied one of the patch above, the patch below will improve
your "transmit timed out" (please apply in order and enable NAPI):
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.10-rc2-mm1/r8169-250.patch
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.10-rc2-mm1/r8169-255.patch
If things perform better you may want to use bigger frames and apply as
well r8169-260.patch and r8169-265.patch.

Yes.
I hope the current set of changes in -mm/-netdev will be merged in
early post-2.6.10.

You will be welcome to upgrade.

Exactly.
One year ago, Realtek's driver was split and merged in the kernel. That
and the contributions of many people took several months to achieve a
(imho) decently stable driver. At the same time, no change appeared on
Realtek's side. Still some months later Realtek issues a new driver with
a rev number bump (2.2). Its code suggests that it includes a partial
merge from some of the changes made to the in-kernel driver as well as
some internal experiments (hooks for missing code).
The drivers are now quite different. A change of version number is 
included in the -mm/-netdev driver to protect the innocent but it seems
I'll have to push weirder numbers. :o)

1 - netif_stop_queue() race between the Tx xmit and the Tx IRQ handler.
2 - "entry" can overflow in rtl8169_tx_interrupt() -> read of random
    status and early free of Tx buffer.
When the in-kernel version had similar code, it translated into "r8169
hangs under load".
