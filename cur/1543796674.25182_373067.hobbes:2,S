No you get them from Red Hat or SuSE or whoever.  One of the core
assumptions of the new development model is that distros whose business
model involves paying people to do QA and regression testing and have
access to bug reports from zillions of users are better positioned than
kernel developers to decide what a "stable" kernel is.
