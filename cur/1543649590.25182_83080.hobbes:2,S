Yep, sorry, word, not byte. My bad. The cost is in the fact 
that this whole process involves loading each word of the data
stream into a register. Which is why I also used to consider
the checksum cost as negligible.

But then why the difference in the checksum/copy and copy?
Are you saying the checksum is not costing you 864 megabytes
a second??
