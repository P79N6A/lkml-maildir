IMHO every embedded developer besides size cares about speed and
reducing complexity of simple things. Yes, this is orthogonal to that,
you want to say to me.
Only thing i wanted to have as reasult is ack or nack on my patch.
Everything else is outside LKML.

In Debian's version it has no `bc', while native `bc' is producing
crap like that:
,-*- bash -*-
|olecom@flower:~$ printf "%u" $(( -1 )) ; echo
|18446744073709551615
|olecom@flower:~$ echo -1 | bc
|-1
|olecom@flower:~$ printf "%u" $(( 0xFF )) ; echo
|255
|olecom@flower:~$ echo FF | bc
|99
|olecom@flower:~$ echo F | bc
|15
|olecom@flower:~$
`-*-
i can't understand the result... I think linux/scripts/makelst may be
updated to have sh's version of address calculation ;)

I'm glad. All i can say in this context: do you know `dash' shell.
It's pretty much OK for not interactive use, small, fast, POSIX
compliant (or should be ;).

Goodluck!
