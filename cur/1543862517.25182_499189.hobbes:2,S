Thanks, I missed that. Since these issues are unrelated I'll just submit
a trivial patch for the hid-debug.h stuff.
Is it possible that there is a regression in the hid-debug stuff? The
mapping does not seem to appear in the dmesg-output. I unfortunately
don't have an earlier kernel available right now to verify, but now the
output on plugging in the device looks like this:
[...]
usbcore: registered new interface driver hiddev
hid-debug: input GenericDesktop.X = 0
hid-debug: input GenericDesktop.Y = 0
hid-debug: input GenericDesktop.Z = 0
hid-debug: input GenericDesktop.Rx = 0
hid-debug: input GenericDesktop.Ry = 0
hid-debug: input GenericDesktop.Rz = 0
[...]
which looks bogus to me, IIRC earlier versions really printed the
mapping to linux input events at this point.
Anyway, the patch is correct anyway, will submit it soon.
Bye,
        Simon
