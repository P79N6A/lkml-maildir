Hi, kernel gurus!
I tested the 2.2.13pre1 kernel (no SMP, compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3).
I'm mounting an exported NFS directory to /mnt/nfs/src, with the
rsize=8192,wsize=8192 options.
When I tried to rename a directory with mv, while midnight commander
was running, and the actual directory was /mnt/nfs/src, the machine
locked up, and the following message appeared on the console:
nfs_dentry_delete: //linux.13pre1 ino=14862748 count=2 nlink=15
The machine answered to ping, I was able to telnet to it, got connected,
but login prompt not appeared. Virtual console switching worked, but
I wasn't able to type anything on the console. Reboot, fsck, etc. and
got the same thing with another directory:
nfs_dentry_delete: //linux ino=1484802999 count=2 nlink=14
The 'linux.13pre1' and 'linux' were the target of mv and not existed
before (ie. mv somedir linux.13pre1). No oops, nothing in the logs.
Any comments or questions? (Please no flames about my bad english...)
