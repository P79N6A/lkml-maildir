The next version of the device registry patch (
http://www.tjansen.de/devreg
) 
will contain a similar feature. 
In the current release bus drivers (like PCI, USB..) register their devices 
in the registry and the devices are then displayed in a generic, 
bus-independent form in the /proc/devreg directory.
In the upcoming version those drivers with devreg support register themselves 
on initialization and also register each driver instance (an instance handles 
a single physical device) that they create. The instance will then be 
connected to the device, devfs nodes will be connected to the driver instance 
and you can get a pretty good graph of the relations between drivers, driver 
instances, devfs nodes/minor numbers and the physical devices.
