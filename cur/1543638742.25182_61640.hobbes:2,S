Really? I'm not able to locate such overwrite in trm290.c. Are they hidden
somewhere else?
Also BUG_ON() in udma_new_table is bogus. Change code:
- u32 cur_len = sg_dma_len(sg) & 0xffff;
+ u32 cur_len = sg_dma_len(sg);
  /* Delete this ... */
  BUG_ON(cur_len > ch->max_segment_size);
  
  *table++ = cpu_to_le32(cur_addr);
- *table++ = cpu_to_le32(cur_len);
+ *table++ = cpu_to_le32(cur_len & 0xffff);
Without first change BUG_ON will not trigger on any transfer: values
up to 0xFE00 are legal, and values over 0x10000 get cut down to
0x0xxxx...
Second change is needed only if we have some driver setting 
max_segment_size to value > 0xffff: currently we do not have such driver,
default is 0xfe00, and value set by cs5530 is 0xfe00 too.

It happens with UDMA0 too (and I tried slowest possible timming at
i845, and it still happens).
