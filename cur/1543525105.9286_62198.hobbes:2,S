Could you enable ACPI? 
My dual pII still crashes - I have 192 MB ram, so PTE_MASK doesn't
explain this crash :-(
The messages were:
init.c:112 bad pmd c0004300 (0..0c0001e3)
remap_area_pte: page already exists
BUG at ioremap.c
it seems that the first ioremap() [acpi_map_table() in
arch/i386/kernel/acpi.c] fails.
Btw, the test for the idle task in panic() looks wrong, what about this
patch? [untested, and netscape has eaten the spaces]
