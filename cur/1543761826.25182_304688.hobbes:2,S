flush_tlb_pgtables() on sparc64 has a BUG() check which
is basically:
	BUG((long)start > (long)end);
This catches two cases of bogus arguments:
1) start --> end straddles sparc64 address space hole
2) start > end
With your changes, this triggers on even the first user
process execution.  Specifically I get the first
trap with start=0x70800000 and end=0x70188000.  (these
addresses are in the region where generally 32-bit tasks
get their non-fixed mmap() requests satisfied, so these
are probably shared library chunks).
I think the VMA gathering optimization one level up in
free_pgtables() has some logic error in it.   Maybe...
I'll try to figure out what exactly is going on, but
perhaps you can spot it before me. :-)
