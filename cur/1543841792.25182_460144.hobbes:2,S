I know it's not the perfect place to ask for, but the Comedi project 
seems to be quiet (dead?) for a lot of months, and I figured, that 
eventually some people who did the job already can help me out.
Unfortunately I have to get a DAQ device working and the so 
called "drivers" and "support" from the manufactor ****** me really 
of; IMHO they're a case for gplviolations.org, since the drivers only 
come for 3 certain distributions in the versions as they are sold in 
the self boxes. The kernel module is precompiled, no not only a BLOB 
but merely a precompiles .ko for the kernels that ship with the 
distribution CDs. And the supported Distributions are old. Not from 
the stone ages, but thinking of ancient rome kinda comes close to it.
At first I really liked GKH's "Instrumentation I/O", but seeing how 
industry cares I don't know if it was really such a great idea.
Ah, were was I? Right: Building the Comedi kernel modules. Making the 
lib was easy enough, but it seems, that Comedi bypasses the kbuild 
system (if that is to support multiple kernel versions why not just 
deliver separate Makefiles and then make -F ?).
Diging in the google archive I found the suggestion, just to turn the 
Makefiles into kbuild ones. I had the same idea, but OTOH I'm 
probably not the only one with the same need, so eventually someone 
already got those Makefiles done. In that case I'd really apreciate, 
to get those.
Sorry for the large "venting"-overhead, but you should see that e-mail 
in my draft box I'd really like to send the guy who suggested 
me: "reconfigure your kernel, to make the module work"; OTOH that 
poor guy probably only looked up the company's knowlegde base, which 
is probably maintained by a groom.
Happy coding
