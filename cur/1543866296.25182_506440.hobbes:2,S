May be that's the ideal scenario. But if you leave it to linker to decide the
number of progaram headers to linker then linker sometimes optimizes and
creates more program headers if it finds empty space between various sections.
Sometime one or two page space gets created between sections because of
alignment restrictions. So effectively, number of program headers were not
fixed, till recently.

Yes I am. I use kexec boot loader which has capability to load ELF kernel
images (vmlinux). That's why I am concerned about linking real mode code
in vmlinux as for kdump case I shall have to be aware that kernel vmlinux
might contain a special PT_LOAD type program header which will contain
real mode code and it does not have to be loaded. Then I will run into
guessing business which one is that real mode PT_LOAD  program header and
my assumption might very well break in next few kernel release.

If I understand it right, you seem to be suggesting that I don't have to 
reload the kernel text and I can only reload the data for second kernel?
We run the whole of the kernel from a mutually execlusive location from
first kernel to mitigate the concerns that first kernel's ongoing DMA might
corrupt second kernel. That's why first kernel's text can't be reused.
Secondly, it gives flexibility to user that either he can choose to use 
the production kernel as capture kernel or an entirely different custom
kernel can be used as capture kernel.

Kexec as a boot loader allows to load both ELF vmlinux file or bzImage.
Hence for kdump, a user got the flexibility to either use vmlinux or 
bzImage for dump captruing purposes. Hence I am concerned about both. 
If real mode code is linked with vmlinux, then kdump will be broken.
bzImage is relocatable. If a new kernel image format is introduced
(compressed ELF), then I will prefer it to be a relocatable one
(if possible).
