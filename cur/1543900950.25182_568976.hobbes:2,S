Subject: [RESEND patch 2.6.22-rc4] ads7846 pendown status check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/13/338

From: Semih Hazar <semih.hazar@indefia.com> 
Pendown status from the PENIRQ pin is currently read only at the beginning
of a sample set. If the pen is lifted just after sampling has began then
sampled values become wrong.
This patch adds an optional platform penirq_recheck_delay attribute.  If
non-zero, samples are only reported to the input subsystem if PENIRQ is
still active that long after the samples taken.

Still applies fine against 2.6.22-git ... this should be in 2.6.23
