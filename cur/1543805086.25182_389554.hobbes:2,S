it doesn't matter. Regardless of the method, the memory has to be locked
due to the FUTURE requirement.

is it? I sort of doubt that (but I'm not a standards expert, but I'd
expect that "lock all in the future" applies to all memory, not just
mmap'd memory

this is true and fully correct
the situation is messy; I can see some value in the hack Ted proposed to
just bump the rlimit automatically at an mlockall-done-by-root.. but to
be fair it's a hack :(
