I *do* think that the kernel refused our mmap() request on grounds of
the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK (32 kB) and not any other reason, because running the
same allocation code as root succeeds, and Linux 2.6.13 is documented to
ignore RLIMIT_MEMLOCK for the super-user.
And I do believe Linux is entirely on IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 grounds here.

As far as the kernel is concerned, yes.
As far as your application is concerned, valloc() does not provide
"mapped" or "locked" pages, but "allocated".

The mlockall() documentation. Any OS allows later mappings to fail if
they cannot be locked, and this is what happens.
The only troublesome spot that remains is valloc() using mmap()
internally, which inherits the mlockall()/mmap() failure modes and
causes bogus "out of memory" returns by valloc().
1. valloc is not required to lock pages
2. yet it can fail if it cannot lock pages
This is a problem from the applications POV, albeit one that is in
glibc's memory allocator.
mlockall() does NOT make promises HOW MUCH memory may be allocated in
the future, and that is the problem at hand. Linux allows us 32 kB (as
unprivileged user even, we don't get that with Solaris or FreeBSD!), but
we want 63 kB and Linux says "Sorry, you can't have that. EAGAIN"

Well... mlockall() allows for, "other implementation-defined limit[s]",
so POSIX is not supportive of your argument here.

This is irrelevant to cdrecord, because it does not trip over this
contradiction.
If I were the cdrecord maintainer, I'd forget about mlockall()
altogether because it's just too broad and doesn't allow something like
"no more auto locking" without unlocking all locked pages (see also Lee
Revell's earlier post), lock the FIFO, command data buffers and
everything explicitly through mlock(), set the scheduler, open the
device and then call setuid() to get rid of the saved set-user-id as
well. This may be narrow-minded, but given mlock() is present in the BSD
world (FreeBSD, NetBSD), in the SysV world (Solaris) and Linux, there's
reason to support it, as these constitute a large user base.
If anything then still fails (command filter), I'd ask the kernel guys
how the restriction can be lifted so that cdrecord can work without ANY
root privileges, in the most portable way.
