Nice idea, but not acceptable as this setup is for production use, you simply
won't do that.
It would be helpful if there was a kernel parameter for disabling the
keyboard(-check) in 2.4. We found out that disabling it as kernel patch is not
the right way, as standard setups with keyboard controller do not work any
longer afterwards. This is a setup where user should be able to choose...
The box contains a BIOS where I can type around with USB-keyboard, btw.
