Yes, the version from 2.6.8-rc1 works, the one from 2.6.8-rc2 does not. 
It looks like 2.6.8-rc1 actually had a newer version of this file.
This one works:
         LK1.2.0-2.6 (Roger Luethi)                                                                                                                                                           
          - Massive clean-up                                                                                                                                                                   
          - Rewrite PHY, media handling (remove options, full_duplex, backoff)                                                                                                                 
          - Fix Tx engine race for good                                                                                                                                                        
This one does not:
          LK1.1.19 (Roger Luethi)
          - Increase Tx threshold for unspecified errors
Relevant options:
CONFIG_VIA_RHINE=m
CONFIG_VIA_RHINE_MMIO=y
