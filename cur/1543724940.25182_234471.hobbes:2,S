AFAICS, this just means that if you have an ext3 filesystem
(i.e. has_journal) that you will fsck 5x as often, not so great.  You
should instead check for INCOMPAT_RECOVER instead of HAS_JOURNAL.
Instead, you could change this to only increment the mount count after
a clean unmount 20% of the time (randomly).  Since most people bitch
about the full fsck anyways this is probably the better choice than
increasing the frequency of checks and forcing the users to change the
check interval to get the old behaviour.
Cheers, Andreas
