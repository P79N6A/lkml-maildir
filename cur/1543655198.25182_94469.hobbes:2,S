I did think of this.  The flags are enums in include/linux/dma-mapping.h  In 
theory they can't be hijacked by an architecture without either changing this 
global header or exciting compiler warnings.
However, I can only see their being two types of drivers: those which do all 
the sync points and those which don't do any, so I can't see any reason for 
there to be any more than two such flags.
I also want an active discouragement from using the may return inconsistent 
API, and I think, given the general programmer predisposition not to want to 
type, that a long flag name (or a long routine name) does this.
I just don't like API names that look like
dma_alloc_may_be_inconsistent()
but if that's what it takes, I'll do it
