Just for the others who may be reading this thread --
If you use sufficient network bandwidth and high quality
enough networks and NFS servers with plenty of resources,
then you _may_ be able to get away with "soft" mounting
for a some period of time.
However, any server, including Solaris and NetApp servers,
will fail, and those failures may or may not affect the
NFS service being provided.  In fact, unless the system
is being carefully administrated and the applications are
written very well, with error detection and recovery in
mind, then corruption can occur, and it can be silent and
unnoticed until too late.  In fact, most failures do occur
silently and get chalked up to other causes because it will
not be possible to correlate the badness with the NFS
client giving up when attempting to communicate with an
NFS server.
I wish you the best of luck, although with the environment
that you describe, it seems like "hard" mounts would work
equally well and would not incur the risks.
