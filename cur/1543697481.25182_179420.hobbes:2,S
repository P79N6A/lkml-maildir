Neither do I, but I can report that iptables is apparently stable, 
witness this from my firewall machine:
---------------------
[root@gene root]# uname -a
Linux gene.coyote.den 2.4.21-rc1-ck6 #9 Mon May 5 23:31:30 EDT 2003 
i586 unknown
[root@gene root]# uptime
 11:14am  up 35 days,  3:19,  2 users,  load average: 1.00, 1.00, 1.00
---------------------
Now admittedly it doesn't have 5000 users, just one.  But everytime 
I'd had problems such as you are describing at the tv station the 
where user count is about 65, its hardware related. I'd start by 
letting memtest86 run on that box for a couple of days, maybe it will 
find some flakey memory.
