That's already implemented. :-) Transport drivers expose transport
specific information in sysfs; udev scripts examine it and create by-id
and by-path symlinks to device files of HDDs.  Not everybody agrees, but
many think that it's sensible to implement just mechanism in kernel and
leave policy to userspace.  My suggestion and the default network
interface names already violate this principle to a degree, but it can
still be implemented in a transport independent way, and userspace can
continue to create whatever names the user needs.
