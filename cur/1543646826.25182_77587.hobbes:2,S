Because you think BK will still have the backing of all kernel developers
using it today if that happens?  Some might find BK's nice to use despite its
license, but locking the main kernel repository into a proprietary format is
totally unacceptable for most if not all of them I'm sure.  That's why Larry
won't go that route or he'll lose the Linux kernel user base right away.
