After the fork() system call, fork() returns the child's pid
(or an error) to the parent, and a ZERO (0) to the child. That
way the code 'knows' if the child or the parent is executing.
     switch ((pid = fork()))
     {
     case 0:    			// Child runs here
         printf("Child\n");
         sleep(1);
         exit(0);
     case -1:			// This is for errors
         fprintf(stderr, "fork() failed (%s)\n", strerror(errno));
         exit(1);
     default:			// The parent executes here
        printf("Parent waits for child with pid %d\n", pid);
        wait(&status);
        printf("Child executed with %d status\n", status >> 8);
     }

sys_fork() should never be executed from inside the kernel because
it is going to copy a process' code and data. The kernel isn't a
process. To make a process from inside the kernel, you need to use:
//
//   Code to execute as a kernel thread.
//
int thread_code(void *ptr)
{
     daemonize("%s", "Kernel Thread!");
     allow_signal(SIGTERM);
     for(;;)		// Run forever
     {
         do_something();
         set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
         if(signal_pending(current))
             complete_and_exit(&exit_flag);
     }
}
//
//   Code to start the kernel thread.
//
pid = kernel_thread(thread_code, NULL, CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES);
//
//   Code to stop the kernel thread.
//
     kill_proc(pid, SIGTERM);
     wait_for_completion(&exit_flag);
