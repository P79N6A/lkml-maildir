I agree that making strxxx() family special is not a good idea. So what
do we do for a random foo(char*) called with an 'unsigned char*'
argument? Silence? Hmmm... It's not immediately obvious that it's indeed
harmless. Yet another -Wxxx option to GCC to silence this particular
case?

"The warning is entirely sucks if and only if it never has true
positives." In all other cases it's only more or less sucks, IMHO.

I'm afraid I don't follow. Do we have a way to say "I want an int of
indeterminate sign" in C? The same way there doesn't seem to be a way
to say "I want a char of indeterminate sign". :( So no, strlen() doesn't
actually say that, no matter if we like it or not. It actually says "I
want a char with implementation-defined sign".

In fact it's implementation-defined, and this may make a difference
here. strlen(), being part of C library, could be specifically
implemented for given architecture, and as architecture is free to
define the sign of "char", strlen() could in theory rely on particular
sign of "char" as defined for given architecture. [Not that I think that
any strlen() implementation actually depends on sign.]

Can we assure that no function taking 'char*' ever cares about the sign?
I'm not sure, and I'm not a language lawyer, but if it's indeed the
case, I'd probably agree that it might be a good idea for GCC to extend
the C language so that function argument declared "char*" means either
of "char*", "signed char*", or "unsigned char*" even though there is no
precedent in the language.
BTW, the next logical step would be for "int*" argument to stop meaning
"signed int*" and become any of "int*", "signed int*" or "unsigned
int*". Isn't it cool to be able to declare a function that won't produce
warning no matter what int is passed to it? ;)

Yes, indeed. So the real problem of the C language is inconsistency
between strxxx() and isxxx() families of functions? If so, what is 
wrong with actually fixing the problem, say, by using wrappers over
isxxx()? Checking... The kernel already uses isxxx() that are macros
that do conversion to "unsigned char" themselves, and a few invocations
of isspace() I've checked pass "char" as argument. So that's not a real
problem for the kernel, right?

Well, even C99 itself does say it. But the kernel already handles this
issue nicely without resorting to requirement to convert char to
unsigned char, isn't it?

As the isxxx() family does not seem to be a real problem, at least in
the context of the kernel source base, I'd like to learn other reasons
to use "unsigned char" for doing strings either in general or
specifically in the Linux kernel.

OK, provided there are actually sound reasons to use "unsigned char*"
for strings, isn't it safer to always use it, and re-define strxxx() for
the kernel to take that one as argument? Or are there reasons to use
"char*" (or "signed char*") for strings as well? I'm afraid that if two
or three types are allowed to be used for strings, some inconsistencies
here or there will remain no matter what.
Another option could be to always use "char*" for strings and always compile
the kernel with -funsigned-char. At least it will be consistent with the
C idea of strings being "char*".
