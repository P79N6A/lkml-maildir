Actually come to think of it they don't need to be exported.
I will move the exports to the last, debugging, patch.

This remains to be determined, and this patchset purposely doesn't
address it.  AFAIU, the two most likely options are extending clone and
unshare, and using new syscalls.  Whatever is decided for the other
namespaces, this should use.
With this patchset (minus the last patch for debugging) uts namespaces
are supported, but processes can't clone their uts namespace yet.

True, that is something that needs to be discussed when the topic
of how to implement unsharing comes up again.
