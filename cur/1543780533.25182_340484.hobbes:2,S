It would be the K7 only.

I once did a weekend version of this with SMP support and for the PIT, i 
had the last cpu to enter idle turn reprogram the PIT. Unfortunately this 
means waiting for all processors and isn't as effective as a result.

Odd, does reprogramming the APIC at that point get it going again?
