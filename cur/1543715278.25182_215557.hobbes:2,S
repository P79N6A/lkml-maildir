First off, thanks for the reply. Does lowering the number of tty devices
interfer with the creation of serial consoles? Can't they start at the
same major number without an issue?

So is my limit wrong? Should I up the lower limit to 16 to account for
this?

Why isn't this done now?

That does make sense.
Just a side note: I have been running with 12 (0 - 11) tty devices
without issue. I haven't tried a serial console, but will shortly, just
to see if it interferes with serial console creation.
Thanks,
