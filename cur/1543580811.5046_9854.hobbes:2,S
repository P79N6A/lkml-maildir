The kernel documentation explicitly says to use egcs-1.1.2 or 2.95 for x86.
If you want to put in #ifdefs then let me assure you that you will then get
a million emails that 'reiserfs doesnt build'. I went this way with older
gcc's in 2.0 and the amount of mail more than doubled by doing the check
If people use other compilers then certainly ignore the bug reports. For 2.2
until recently that was policy with gcc 2.95 
Also remember to check for 2.96 but not 2.96-69 (the errata one) and remember
to do specific architecture tests as there is no other compiler set available
for IA64 for example.

Gcc 3.0 CVS branch wont build the kernel either right now - DAC960 fails.
