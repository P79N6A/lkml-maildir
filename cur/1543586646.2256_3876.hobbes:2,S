I was actually suspecting that the extra lines in your patch were there for a
reason :)
A few questions:
What is the real impact of a (slight) change in scheduling semantics?
Under which situation one should notice a difference?
As you state in your papers the global decision comes with a cost, is it worth it?
Could you make a port of your thing on recent kernels?
I tried and I failed and I don't have enough time to figure out why, that should be
trivial for you though.
TIA, ciao,
