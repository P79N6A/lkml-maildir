The fact that a timer is a file garanties you the usage of an existing
infrastructure and existing APIs to use it. For example epoll_create(2)
returns you a file descriptor, and this enable you ( for example ) to drop
this file descriptor inside a poll set. Also you get the cleanup
infrastructure that otherwise you would have to code every time, for each
new object that you create, by yourself. Something like :
int timer_create(void);
int timer_set(struct timespec *ts);
and you can use epoll or poll to get the timer event, and close(2) to
destroy it. You get automatic compatibility with lots of nice stuff having
an object that is actually a file and I usually like it as idea.

I asked this about a week ago. It's _trivial_ to do in epoll. I did not
receive any feedback, so I didn't implement it. Feedback will be very much
appreciated here ...
