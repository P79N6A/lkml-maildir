Thanks!
The first one (your /dev/sdb1 if I am not mistaken)
has 65245 clusters, while the fat only describes 64256.
So, you waste a thousand clusters where the kernel
only expects at most 3 wasted clusters.
I suppose the following patch would help:

About the second disk, it looks uneventful:

But there is no FAT filesystem to be seen - everything is just empty.
