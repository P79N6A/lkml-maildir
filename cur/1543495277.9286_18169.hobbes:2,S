`man select` on my system explicitly states; 
	"On Linux, timeout is modified to reflect the amount of time
	not slept; most other implementations do not do this."
Therefore, it should always be modified unless it returns instantly
because there is activity on the fd. The kernel may have changed the
order in which it checks the time and the fd so programs that rely
on older behavior may be broken.
Since systems can modify the structure (it's not const), code
should not rely on it remaining untouched.
