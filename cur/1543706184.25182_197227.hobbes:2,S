Do you honestly think that if your code ever makes it into the main
kernel tree, you would be able somehow to extact that and use it from
userspace properly?
No, just don't do this.
Remember, if you _can_ do this from userspace, then your code doesn't
need to be in the kernel at all :)
Oh, and I repeat, let's see some code.  No more bickering about "what
ifs" anymore.
