 Only early revisions of the P54C (75-200MHz) Pentium processors are
affected: steppings B1, B3, B5, C2 and cB1 (or 1, 2, 4, 5 and 11) as
reported by cpuid).  MMX Pentia and later chips are OK as well as any
systems using external i82489DX APICs (so far i486, P5 (60/66MHz) Pentium
and P54C Pentium systems with i82489DX APICs has been found, AFAIK).  Once
I proposed the option to be user-selectable as an advanced CPU option
(<asm/bugs.h> does appropriate validation), but the proposal was rejected
as incomprehesible to an average user doing a kernel build.
