If you don't implement all 3, you get an ugly asymetry that
messes up timestamp comparisons.
You'd get ctime<mtime when both were set to the same value.

No way. You still get the same errors seen on clients that don't
know you are abusing the time stamps.
The ext2 inode has 6 obviously free bytes, 6 that are only used
on filesystems marked as Hurd-type, and 8 that seem to be claimed
by competing security and EA projects. So, being wasteful, it would
be possible to have picoseconds on all 4 time stamps. Doing mere
milliseconds on 3 timestamps would leave us 16 bytes for security.
This is what we have today:
struct ext2_inode {
        __u16   i_mode;         /* mode (type & permission bitss) */
        __u16   i_uid;          /* owner's UID */
        __u32   i_size;         /* size (low 32 bits) */
        __u32   i_atime;        /* access time */
        __u32   i_ctime;        /* inode change time */
        __u32   i_mtime;        /* modification time */
        __u32   i_dtime;        /* deletion time */
        __u16   i_gid;          /* group ID */
        __u16   i_links_count;  /* link count */
        __u32   i_blocks;       /* block count */
        __u32   i_flags;        /* ext2 flags */
        union {
        __u32   i_translator;   /* translator (Hurd only) */
        __u32   i_res_fork;     /* resource fork (Linux privs) */
        } u1;
        __u32   i_block[15];    /* block pointers */
        __u32   i_version;      /* inode generation (for NFS) */
        __u32   i_file_acl;     /* file ACL */
        union {
        __u32   i_dir_acl;      /* directory ACL */
        __u32   i_size_high;    /* high 32 bits of 64-bit size */
        } u2;
        __u32   i_reserved1;
        __u16   i_reserved2;
        __u16   i_mode_high;    /* extra mode bits (Hurd only) */
        __u16   i_uid_high;     /* high 16 bits of 32-bit UID */
        __u16   i_gid_high;     /* high 16 bits of 32-bit GID */
        __u32   i_author;       /* author (Hurd only) */
};
