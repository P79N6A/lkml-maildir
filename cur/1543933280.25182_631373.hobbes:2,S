As long as pci_enable_ext_cfg_space(pdev) enables extended accesses for 
-all- devices, the plan is mostly sound.
That largely eliminates the inconsistency issue.
The only thing I would worry about is whether "config space suddenly 
grew larger" condition will confuse userspace -- but that is NOT an 
objection, just a worry.
