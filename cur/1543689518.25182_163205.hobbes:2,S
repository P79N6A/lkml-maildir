It had crossed my mind, and my plan was actually to get rid of them
since the scripts were not updated. Good to see you are looking into
this now.
If we want to keep them in the kernel, I suggest a new naming:
configcheck:
includecheck:
This follows the *config pattern, but suffixed with check.
A tangent - could it be possible to build this into sparse instead?
The plan is to give it more kernel awareness anyway, so it should
be simple to check for the above as well.
