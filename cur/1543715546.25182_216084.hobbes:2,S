Have you ever written a complete program in assembler? I don't mean a 
small utility, I mean a full application. If you started today 
transcribing the kernel sources for 2.6.x, by the time you finished (not 
including debugging) the standard would no doubt be kernel 4.x or 
beyond. Your assembler version would be vastly outdated, lack features, 
and the methodology would be far behind what will be common at that 
time. - Just my opinion -
