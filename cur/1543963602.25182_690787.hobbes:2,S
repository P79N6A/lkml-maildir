I have an issue similar to yours, Hugh.
I see a lot of segfaults when compiling the kernel with make -j3
after coming back from a "echo standby > /sys/power/state" in
my desktop.
For example,
sh[10355]: segfault at 80fd0a4 ip 0807a9a8 sp bfe56800 error 5 in bash[8048000+b4000]
make[12628]: segfault at 80593d0 ip 080593d0 sp bfd8087c error 5 in make[8048000+26000]

sh[13992]: segfault at 80b3030 ip 080b3030 sp bf8b050c error 5 in bash[8048000+b4000]

I've just tried Ingo's suggestion of "nopat" but it did not solve my
problem. I think I will try to bisect it this weekend if I manage
to get some time.
Just wanted to say I have this problem for now. More info about my
desktop is here:
