I second that. Unlike majority of users I suppose, I upgrade the kernel often 
and I am on the bleeding edge (laptop user with some drivers still being in 
development). Even with oldconfig it's easy to miss a useful driver 
(sometimes there's no help or the volume of new options is too large).
Something that can do the hardware detection, then maps that to drivers would 
be very useful.
