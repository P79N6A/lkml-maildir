There is one more security-related point:
We may decide to not make the device node at all, in order
to prevent use of some dangerous/experimental device or driver.
We can't do that if the device is auto-created.
Root is usually capable of running mknod of course,
but it can be prevented. For example with a fs that
starts out rw but is remounted ro with no option for going back.
Or /dev on cdrom . . .
