Perhaps you have a "read-only" line in the lilo.conf section for whatever
kernel you're booting.  It's possible that initscripts are remounting the
partition read-only, but not likely, and if you're using journalling, it's
best to check your initscripts and get rid of all the junk that runs
e2fsck and then remounts read-write.
