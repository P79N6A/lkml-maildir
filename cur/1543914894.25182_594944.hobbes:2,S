That advice wasn't regarding relicensing. Dual-licensed code allows 
distribution and use under either license. If I get BSD/GPL code, I can 
follow the GPL exclusively and I don't have to follow the BSD license at all. 
And the alternative is also true. (ie: follow the BSD license exclusively and 
ignore the GPL)
It's not "relicensing" - it's following *WHICH* of the offered terms are more 
agreeable.
I'll just snip the rest, since you seem confused.
