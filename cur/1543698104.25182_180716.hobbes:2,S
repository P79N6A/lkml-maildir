Hi,
I wonder whether libata can easily be made compatible with swsup or pmdisk.
Currently my tries stop with the message:
PM: Preparing system for suspend
Stopping tasks: 
=================================================exiting...========
  stopping tasks failed (1 tasks remaining)
Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, katad-1 not stopped
  done
I think that katad belongs to libata.
Cheers,
Prakash
