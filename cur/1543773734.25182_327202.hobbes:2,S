How about delaying this until the high res timers patches are ready?
That way you can save power and avoid the latency regression, in fact it
would be a huge improvement from user POV.
Consider a program with a 5ms RT constraint, like a game or mplayer.
Currently it uses the RTC on 2.4/HZ=100 systems and usleep() on
2.6/HZ=1000.  Allowing HZ to regress to 250 would force us to handle
2.4, 2.6.1 - 2.6.12, and 2.6.13+ separately.  It would be a huge mess.
