True, I just find this whole thing rather disgusting: different
behavior for read/write vs. mmap; but you're right, it's nothing
new and probably the most pragmatic "solution".

True, but even this doesn't help for MMIO space, where a device may
decode less than a full page.  So you'd still end up accessing address
holes.  Just that x86 returns garbage in that case (I think).
