Sounds interesting.  I've been meaning to work on this too for quite a
while, but I'm glad to see you beat me to it.
An example of an in-tree use case for this would be the mlx4 drivers--
you can look at drivers/net/mlx4/intf.c to see the simple stupid
solution I came up with to allow an IB and a NIC (not yet upstream)
driver to share the same PCI device.  A good test for your stuff would
be if it simplifies the code from the ad hoc solution I came up with.
