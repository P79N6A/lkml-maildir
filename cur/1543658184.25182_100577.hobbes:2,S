The last version I released is here: 
http://people.sistina.com/~thornber/patches/2.5-unstable/2.5.51/2.5.51-dmfs-1.tar.bz2
There are still a couple of easy to fix issues with it (eg. the
kmalloc while a spin lock is held that Andrew Morton pointed out :).
Both Andrew Morton and Greg KH expressed concerns with the way I've
mapped the dm semantics onto the filesystem
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103975736919315&w=2).
So Greg is currently trying to get a sysfs interface working.
We need to get a concensus of opinion in the community as to what is a
good interface.  I'm not going to be rushed into including something
in dm that could cause critism for years to come.  dmfs is what
Alasdair Kergon and I have proposed, we're just waiting for an
alternative to kick off the discussions ATM.
