A lot of those are probably broken in some way agreed.

With a particular sleep pattern it could get more CPU time.

You would need to rename the scheduler to "sometimes O(1)" first @)
Besides - but I guess you're aware of it - any randomized algorithms tend
to drive benchmarkers and performance analysts crazy because their performance
cannot be repeated. So it's usually better to avoid them unless there is 
really no alternative.
