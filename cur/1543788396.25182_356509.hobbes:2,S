s/git@vger.kernel.org/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/ in the Cc: list, this
isn't a GIT issue.
Should that:
#define PIPE_BUFFERS (16)
really be a function of PAGE_SIZE?  Many systems have a 4K page size
so they get 64K of buffering per pipe.  But ia64 defaults to 16K page
size, so pipes are suddenly 256K ... and with a 64K page size we
have 1MB per pipe.
So perhaps:
#define PIPE_BUFFERS (65536 / PAGE_SIZE)
But that would leave PIPE_BUFFERS as "1" on a 64K page size system, is
there any double-buffering benefit from having more than one page on the
pipe list?  If so, then something like:
#define PIPE_BUFFERS min(2, (65536 / PAGE_SIZE))
but then gcc is unhappy using the super-type safe "min" in the
places that use PIPE_BUFFERS ... so we'd end up with:
#define PIPE_BUFFERS ((65536 / PAGE_SIZE) > 1 ? (65536 / PAGE_SIZE) : 2)
