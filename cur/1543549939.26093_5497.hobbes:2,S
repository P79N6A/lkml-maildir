If that memory is used for I/O cache then such memory should released when the
system runs into swap instead of swapping it out too (otherwise it's not cache
anymore and it could be slower than re-reading from disk the real data in
rawio).

Agreed, that's why I said shm performance under swap is very important
as well (I'm not understimating it).
But again: if the shm contains I/O cache it should be released and not swapped
out.  Swapping out shmfs that contains I/O cache would be exactly like swapping
out page-cache.
