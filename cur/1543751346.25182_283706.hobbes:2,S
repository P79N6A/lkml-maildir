I'd like to add some personal view : After 2.4.x, we have had a fork and
2.5.x was born, clearly identified as a development tree, so no stability
guaranteed... Then one day came 2.6.0, and so on...
I'm sorry, but I still cannot consider 2.6.x being any stable the way 2.4.x
is today.

I mostly agree. When a new 2.4.x comes out, I have a confident feeling
about it, and there is no reason for me to wait 2 or 3 days to know if 
it's stable or not. It's part of a stable branch, and there are no
major changes in it.
2.6.x, I still consider as a development branch. OK, people changed the
numbering from 2.5.x to 2.6.x, but the number of changes still going on
didn't really change. Just have a look at the numbers : patches are even
bigger now that we are in a "stable" branch (4Mo average for 2.6 patch, 
gzip when we had a 1Mo average for 2.5 !)
Yes, it is a wonderful playground. So let's keep it a playground, let
number it 2.5.x again, and play with. Or let it be a stable branch,
and do something for people needing a playground.

PS : on my personal computer, I'm a player, so I'm running 2.6.x, but don't
expect me to put that on a production server for long... No way, not yet,
not as long as the decision on what *really* is 2.6.x is clear.
