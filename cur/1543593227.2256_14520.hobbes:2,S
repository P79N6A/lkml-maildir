Yes, that was a very unfortunate decision, back in the good old times
when nfs was implemented. And smb, ncp, coda followed nfs.
Nevertheless, there is no problem adding vfs_parse_mount_options().
For example, one can have a flag FS_HAS_BINARY_MOUNT_DATA in
the fs_flags field of the struct file_system_type that describes
the filesystem type, and refrain from trying to parse the mount data
when this bit is set.
