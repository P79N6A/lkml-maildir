Subject: bonnie++ benchmarks for ext2,ext3,ext4,jfs,reiserfs,xfs,zfs on software raid 5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

CONFIG:
Software RAID 5 (400GB x 6): Default mkfs parameters for all filesystems.
Kernel was 2.6.21 or 2.6.22, did these awhile ago.
Hardware was SATA with PCI-e only, nothing on the PCI bus.
ZFS was userspace+fuse of course.
Reiser was V3.
EXT4 was created using the recommended options on its project page.

THOUGHTS
Overall JFS seems the fastest but reviewing the mailing list for JFS it 
seems like there a lot of problems, especially when people who use JFS > 1 
year, their speed goes to 5 MiB/s over time and the defragfs tool has been 
removed(?) from the source/Makefile and on Google it says not to use it 
due to corruption.
