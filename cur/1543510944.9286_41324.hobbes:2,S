Also, the following code from epic100.c worries me:
+#define request_region request_mem_region
+#define release_region release_mem_region
Mixing I/O addresses and MMIO in the same code is a really bad idea
IMHO.  It obscures code, possibly hiding flaws when these defines are
active.  You can find other code like this too.
Most of the net code seems to be structure with pio in mind, and MMIO
added as an afterthought.  This code design might be an underlying cause
of all the problems wrt. MMIO, and physical vs. virtual addresses.
Check over the kernel archives for the recent PCI probing thread, mainly
between myself, Donald, and Alan.  There are several issues related to
MMIO and the current scan code.

I favor the latter solution, but solving it that way probably bloat the
pci scan structure.

If the driver uses MMIO, it should be using writel() and friends, and
also calling iounmap().  Using 'vbase' or 'virt_base' or similar is best
IMHO.

Nah, it can be done generically in scan.c...  If it uses MMIO, it
_should_ be calling ioremap().  In a thread long past, I believe Alan
said:

required in 2.3.x.

Granted it is now 2.3.x post-feature-freeze, but we might as well start
doing things The Right Way(tm) now.  That is, religiously following
Documentation/IO-mapping.txt at any rate.

In the PCI probe thread Donald said there was a reason why he didn't do
a request_region in scan.c (but he didn't elaborate)

Whichever code obtains the mappings should also release them.

If scan.c sets up virt_base automatically, there need only be a flag
that tells the driver whether or not to use pio.
