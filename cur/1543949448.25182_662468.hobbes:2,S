It was always unconditional, and neither adding, toggling nor removing 
of CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING changed this invariant.

in .c files, not messing with a global #define in a way that the results 
on 24 architectures with 7 different releases of gcc would be unpredictable.

are the result of a quick Google search of me stating this previously on
