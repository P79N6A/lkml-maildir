I am trying to determine which ktimers / hrt related patches are part of the rt 
series of patches and having some diffculty doing so.  I've heard it said that 
the wish is for people to evaluate the rt series as a standalone patch, rather 
than a collection of others.  I can understand this point of view, but in the 
case where someone is migrating from a kthrt kernel to an rt kernel and wants to 
verify that certain bugfixes etc have been applied, it would be very nice to be 
able to see the patch series file.  Can anyone provide such a list?
Thanks,
