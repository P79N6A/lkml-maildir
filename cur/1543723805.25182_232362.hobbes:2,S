Subject: Re: [PATCH] Update in-kernel orinoco drivers to upstream current CVS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The news:
- I got the adequate patch from the cvs repository
- 35 patches are available at the usual location. The series-mm file
  describes the ordering of the patches. I'll redo the numbering as
  it starts to be scary
- the remaining diff weights ~210k so far
At least it makes reviewing easier.
