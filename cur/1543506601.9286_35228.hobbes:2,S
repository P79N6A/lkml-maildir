I doubt it. BTW, 'ps -ax' is incorrect usage.

It doesn't look hidden to me:
0 albert$ ps -u luser -U luser            
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 4095 ttypc    00:00:00 su
 4096 ttypc    00:00:00 bash
12097 ttypc    00:32:45 netscape-commun
12107 ttypc    00:00:01 netscape-commun
13089 ttypc    00:16:11 hide
That last one is your program. Try it. Even when using the less-powerful
BSD syntax and default format, I see a suspicious process with no name:
0 albert$ ps U luser 
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
 4095 ttypc    SW     0:00 [su]
 4096 ttypc    S      0:00 -bash
12097 ttypc    S     32:46 /usr/lib/netscape/netscape-communicator
12107 ttypc    S      0:01 [netscape-commun]
13089 ttypc    R     17:43     
Then beating a dead GNU:
0 albert$ ps --user luser --User luser --format
pid,euser,ruser,fname,comm,args
  PID EUSER    RUSER    COMMAND  COMMAND          COMMAND
 4095 luser    luser    su       su               [su]
 4096 luser    luser    bash     bash             -bash
12097 luser    luser    netscape netscape-commun 
/usr/lib/netscape/netscape-com
12107 luser    luser    netscape netscape-commun  [netscape-commun]
13089 luser    luser    hide     hide

Use of the string in /proc/pid/stat would be incorrect in many cases.
The empty space is correct output.
