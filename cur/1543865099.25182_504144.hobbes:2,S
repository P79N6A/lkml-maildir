OK, I'll try to recover what I did (as I've dropped the change after I
saw it can't do 460,800), and submit the patch.

I expect it'll be rather hard for me to test the changes then, as my IBM
ThinkPad T43 suffers from kernel IDE/SATA/PATA issues, and running every
new kernel was a big pain so far (it currently runs 2.6.16.8) :(
