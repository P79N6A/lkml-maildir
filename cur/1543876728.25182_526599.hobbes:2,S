I would shy from saying that "that's the only problem". It could also be
	for_each_cpu_mask(some_mask)
		do_something_which_sleeps();
where some_mask is suppsoed to represent a subset of online cpus.
For ex: policy->cpus is a mask maintained by cpufreq, which it iterates thr' 
whenever changing cpu frequency. The cpus in that mask are supposed to be 
a subset of online cpus (with CPU_ONLINE/DEAD handlers in cpufreq.c adjusting 
the mask upon hotplug).
We could adopt a similar trick (get/put_each_cpu_mask) that you describe
below in those extended cases as well.

The real question is how do we convert over those sleeping
for_each_cpu_mask users (for ex: flush_workqueue) such that they don't
block freezer/hotplug for long periods?
One option is to probably rewrite them to understand that
online[or a derived]_map could have changed everytime they come out of a 
(un)interruptible sleep and deal with arising races appropriately. That
would mean a bit of maintenance headache unfortunately (I was hoping
freezer will lead to zero maintenance headache :)
Besides, how problematic is this in practise (that threads sleep for
extended durations in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state breaking
freezer/suspend/hotplug)?
Should we ignore this for the timebeing and take up later as and when
users report problems?
