WRT distribution vendors, UnitedLinux, SuSE and Mandrake already come
with a bootsplash screen per default. But this is a seperate issue.

I think you are exaggerating with the consequences of having a
bootsplash as an _option_. 
The problem with IE is that you cannot remove it from a system, so you
have to have 2 browsers installed. With the above mentioned Linux
distributions you can, with no additional downloads from the internet,
change one config variable in /etc/sysconfig/.. and you will not get 
a bootsplash anymore, plus no memory is wasted for the pictures as well.

If one of these companies wants a graphical bootsplash, they can, due to
the freedom of choice, do so. Whether or not this code ends up in the
kernel is a completely different thing and decided by the maintainers of
the several subsystems, not by any software vendor. Don't search an
enemy where there is none.

I still don't get the connection between "bootsplash is bad" and
"windows has a bootsplash". 
Windows has a gui and modal dialogs, by now even a virtual filesystem 
layer. Should we get rid of that, because Microsoft uses something 
similar? No, for sure not. "Ours" is better, because everybody can
choose to use it or not, and to change it to own needs and wishes.

Hey, maybe I can help you out with a little hint... If they ever do,
"vga=normal" will get you back to the good old times and 10 key strokes
make your day.
