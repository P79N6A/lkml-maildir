The tapping works initially, then stops.  I hadn't put 2+2 together with
the 5-second idle bit, but that seems the likely issue.
I applied that patch you sent out yesterday, and now tapping works and
I'm not seeing the mouse stall/jump problem.  I'm at 21+ hours uptime
now, with no mouse problems, so I think setting the resync_time to 0
looks like the right fix.
Thanks,
Frank
