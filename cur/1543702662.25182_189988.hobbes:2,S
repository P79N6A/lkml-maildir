Thanks for that Marcos,
appending "psmouse.psmouse_proto=imps" in lilo.conf has returned my 
mouse to is usual self.
You are a star :)
I do seem to remember when I ran another well known os on this laptop 
that the mouse worked much better without the drivers installed.
I'm sure that the kernel driver probably works much better on new 
hardware and that some folk have put allot of hard work into the kernel 
and X driver. I think its very cool that with the X driver you can have 
non-linear settings left and right tappings as well as scroll bars etc. 
But I must be getting old because I also like the simple way it just 
works without a driver.
Regards
Jon Westgate
