If everyone, or every distribution at least, has to change it then the
default is probably wrong.  The error message in the postfix logs didn't
immediately point me at the issue, especially since I tried debugging on
one of our "production" mxes, only to discover that the epoll limit
didn't exist there.  They're slightly behind in kernel versions.

This thread suggests that it's not just postfix having the issue, and
offers 1024 as a saner default:
http://www.mail-archive.com/fedora-kernel-list@redhat.com/msg01618.html
There's also a Russian thread that pointed me at this patch in the first
place, and another place that suggested 1024 as well.  Seems "the
cloud"[tm] is converging on 1024.

I'll have a look at it.  There are two main choices I think - either one
file with just the "max", or some data view that shows all the users'
counts.  It looks like it will have to enumerate the user list anyway.
(I've been poking around in kernel/user.c.  Looks like a
hlist_for_each_entry on uidhash_table will do the trick.  I'm guessing
we only want to display the value for the current user_ns anyway.  I
don't really understand the user namespacing stuff, since I've never
used it)
Most of all I'm interested in this because if it's a good way to
actually have some viable statistics on what the default vaule 
should be.

       patch before, and it had a lot of babysitting from Linus! )
