I actually don't care that much whether this is merged or not. In fact the 
function itself is pretty trivial and standalone, so any 3rd party module 
willing to modify current->mm->flags can just reimplement it line-by-line 
themselves without breaking the license anyway ...
My main point here was that we should probably better document somewhere 
what are the intended usage scenarios for EXPORT_SYMBOL() vs. 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). "Really internal interface" seems a little bit vague 
to me.
