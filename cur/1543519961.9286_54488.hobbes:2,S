Hello:
I followed the kernel howto to download, compile, and
upgrade my kernel for my RH 6.0 installation.
Since I am on a laptop, I boot from a floppy disk
created during the installation to get into linux.
Unforutnately, when I booted from the floppy, I
still get the old kernel.
How do I upgrade the floppy disk?
Thanks,
	Neil.
