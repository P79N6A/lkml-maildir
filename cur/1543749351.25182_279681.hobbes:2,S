Subject: Cannot mount multi-session DVD with ide-cd, must use ide-scsi

I can confirm that Linux Kerenl 2.6.9 still cannot mount a
multi-session DVD if the last session starts at > 2.2 GB.  The
only information on this problem I can find is here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108827602322464&w=2
Is there a patch anywhere to address this?  it would be great if
I didn't have to use ide-scsi anymore, which imposes it's own set
of added difficulties.
Please CC replies.  Thanks much.
