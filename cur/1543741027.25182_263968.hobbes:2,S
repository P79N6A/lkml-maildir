OK, this one seems like the hard one.  Wouldn't this cause weird
behavior though?  For example Linux only calculates the delay loop once,
at boot time.  Does this render *delay() useless?

Doesn't matter.  As long as they are both the same speed, JACK's
calculations will be correct.  We calculate the CPU speed at startup.
Then we just read the TSC and do the math.

We don't have to support this.  If someone wants to do it they will have
to bind jackd to one CPU or the other.

We don't have to support this.
Does anyone know how OSX/CoreAudio handles the situation?  Apparently
realtime apps work flawlessly on speed scaling laptops under OSX.
