Hi
I do know this community is busy with more important things , but i am
out of ideas/search  on this one.
How do i get the patch for the CVE-2004-1334 ? I have an opensource
linux 2.4.28 on my production server.
If you think this question is stupid enough , then i would eventually
write a patch for this .The trouble i have is on applying the patch
cos my understanding of GPL is pretty confusing.
Please point me to the patch for the above .
Regards
King khan
