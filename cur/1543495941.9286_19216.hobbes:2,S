I recently read about the streams facility in NTFS. I searched the
internet (not very thoroughly) to see if these streams would be
considered for linux. I didn't find very much info about it, except that
they wouldn't fit in the unix file interface.
I do see some internal applications for streames though within the ext2
(or ext3 or whatever) filesystem, which might be of use. I'll mention
them:
1) ext2compr: Compressed files need a bitmap telling which blocks are
compressed. A separate stream for this might be handy.
2) ACL: Access Control Lists might use a separate stream
3) Capabilities: I hardly know anything about capabilities, but I assume
they need some adminsitration. This might be done in a separate stream.
These are just some thoughts, and they may thought by someone else
already, but I'm curious about your opinion on this.
