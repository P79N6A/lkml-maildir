Linus/Jens,
I've just completed my review of submit_bio and the changes to 
generic_make_request and I have some questions for whomever
can answer.
1.  The changes made to submit_bh indicate I can now send long 
chains of variable block size requests to the I/O layer similiar
to the capability of Windows 2000 and NetWare I/O subsystems.
2.  The elevator layer is merging these requests, and making a 
single sweep request for contiguous sector runs.
3.  In theory, I should be able to support page cache capability
for NWFS and possibly NTFS in Linux the way these wierd non-Unix 
OS's work.
4.  This interface may **NOT** support non-block aligned requests
across all the drivers.  I also need to be able to submit a 
request chain 512-2048-512-1024-4096 where the first IO requested
may by on a non-block aligned boundry.  i.e.  Device is configured
for 1024 byte blocks, I start the request as 512 @ LBA 1 -> 1024 @ LBA 2, 
etc.  The code looks like it will work.
I would love to test this wonderful code and will hopefully this evening,
however, all the SCSI drivers appear to be broken, as well as the 
3Ware. :-)
Please advise,
Jeff
