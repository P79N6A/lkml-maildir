Just an idea, I don't know how well this works what with the 'IDE
can't do write barriers right' and related effects:
- Allow all nodes to cache as many blocks as they wish
- The atomic operation "update this block" includes "invalidate this
  block, if cached" broadcast to all nodes
Performance would certainly become an issue; depending on the
architecture bus sniffing as in certain MP cache consistency protocols
might be feasible (I, node 3, see a transfer from node 1 going to
block #42, which is in my cache; so I update my cache using the data
part of the block transfer as it comes by on the bus).
So long,
   Joe
