humm... ok, but considering your recent summary for various kernels...
I guess, it doesn't qualify as the primary suspect... it just likely
affects something else.

yeah, one of the options for 2048 would be presence of 2 nice(0)
cpu-hogs (1024 is the weight for a nice(0) task).

yep, that's what load_balance_newidle() is about... so maybe there are
some factors resulting in its inconsistency/behavioral differences on
different kernels.
Let's say we change a pattern for the niced task: e.g. run for 100 ms.
and then sleep for 300 ms. (that's ~25% of cpu load) in the loop. Any
behavioral changes?
