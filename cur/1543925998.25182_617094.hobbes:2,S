The tarball contains a copy of the series file.  For some reason LARGE
numbers of people miss it and ask me "hey, where's the series file?".  Odd.

Yes, the -mm patches contain large amount of fuzz.  I'll occasionally go in
and do a mass defuzzing (shaving?) but it all goes fuzzy again within a
day.
I _could_ rediff all the time, but I keep all the patches under revision
control and I often need to grab the previous version of a patch (when I've
just dropped an earlier patch, and that earlier patch had caused me to redo
this patch).  Having lots of revisions due to unnecessary rediffing would
complicate that.

It's in there ;)
btw, I put the patches in a directory called "broken-out" so that you can
untar them in your kernel tree and not have them stomped all over your
existing patches/ directory.  symlink it...
