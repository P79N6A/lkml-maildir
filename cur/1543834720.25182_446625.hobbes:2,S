Since I gave a big thumbs up for Evgivny's kevent work yesterday
on linux-kernel, you might want to start by comparing your work
to his.  Because his has the advantage that 1) we have code now
and 2) he has written many test applications and performed many
benchmarks against his code which has flushed out most of the
major implementation issues.
I think most of the people who have encouraged your work are unaware
of Evgivny's kevent stuff, which is extremely unfortunate, the two
works are more similar than they are different.
I do not think discussing all of this on netdev would be perceived
as noise. :)
