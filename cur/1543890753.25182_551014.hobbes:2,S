Yes. After all, STR simply shouldn't _care_.
The rule should be that in a well-written setup, STR "just works" whether 
user processes are suspended or not. In other words, the whole freezing 
part isn't about STR. It should be totally immaterial.
(Of course, that assumes that the freezing is _sane_, of course: ie the 
core kernel threads shouldn't all be frozen. I think Rafael's patch to 
turn the defaults around are a big step in the right direction).
