I tried both of these, and I must be doing something wrong.  For (1), I
grabbed the code you mentioned from the RiscPC port (setup_mm_for_reboot()
and some code from the soft reset routine).  After calling
setup_mm_for_reboot, if I call __ioremap(), the processor hangs.  If I shut
down the MMU, I get the same results.
Where would be a good place to find an example of how to implement your
second suggestion?
thanks.  sorry to keep bothering you.  i'll also try asking on the arm
newsgroup...
