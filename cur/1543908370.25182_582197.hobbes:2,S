Fill in ru_maxrss by, for RUSAGE_BOTH or RUSAGE_CHILDREN, walking the
list of children and summing the hiwater_rss for each.  For RUSAGE_BOTH
or RUSAGE_SELF also include the hiwater_rss for the calling process.

Like a number of other folks, we recently had a need for a non-/proc way
of getting the RSS of a process and happened on getrusage().  Unlike the
rest, though, we fixed the system call to do what we want.
The code itself was lifted from task_mem() in proc/task_mmu.c.  The only
questionable bit is where it does the read_lock() of the tasklist_lock;
although it seems safe enough, I would appreciate if those more
knowledgeable about that locking vet it (briefly) for safety.
