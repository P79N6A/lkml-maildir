It doesn't even have to be _you_ that didn't save the .config. Sometimes one
has to compile a kernel for a server someone else has been maintaining. You
may not know if and where the .config for the old kernel is. Or perhaps it's
a vendor kernel.
In such case it's pretty convenient to just cat /proc/config.
