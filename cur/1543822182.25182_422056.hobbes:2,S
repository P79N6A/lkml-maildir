Hmm.. No, the statistics are sent down using the netlink interface
to listeners on the netlink group (on every task exit) or to the task that

The stats are currently gathered in kernel and used by user space.

struct task_delay_info be moved to common data structure as an aggregate
containing all the delay stats data?
