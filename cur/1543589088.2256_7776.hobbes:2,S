OK, I was doing this for the ext3 port I'm working on for 2.4, and ran into
a snag.  In the ext3_inode_info, there is a list_head.  However, if this is
moved into a separate slab struct, it is now impossible to locate the inode
from the offset in the slab struct.  When I was checking the size of each
inode_info struct, I noticed several others that had list_heads in them.
One solution is that we store list_heads in the inode proper, after generic_ip.
Cheers, Andreas
