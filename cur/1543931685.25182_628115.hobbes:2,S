Ahh... BINGO!
This is very likely the same problem that I first reported back in 2.6.21(20?),
when NOHZ and HPET first came in!
It never occurred to me to wait a full 8-minutes though,
so I just rebooted again after a 1-2 minute wait each time.
Seen on Core2Duo T7400 and Core2Quad E6600 systems, with kernels 2.6.21/22
at various points.  Not consistent -- sometimes it would boot after a few
attempts, sometimes not.
It always hung around the "Switched to high resolution mode" messages.

Oh good, an explanation!
Now we just need a creative fix.
One thing that *might* be sufficient, would be to do the
delay loop calibration twice, and compare the results to
see if they're within 10% (pick a number) of each other.
Is there a flag or something that SMI sets that we could poll
before/after the calibration?  That could be used to tell us
that it needs redoing ?
