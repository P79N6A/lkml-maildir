Network is a no-go for me:
[root@tornado ~]# /etc/init.d/network restart
e100: 0000:06:03.0: e100_eeprom_load: EEPROM corrupted
e100: probe of 0000:06:03.0 failed with error -11
sky2 0000:04:00.0: unsupported chip type 0xff
sky2: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -95
Both drivers worked under 2.6.14-rc5-mm1, but failed with 2.6.14-mm2.  I also 
re-tested against 2.6.14-mm1 and this problem also occurs there (I didn't get 
to test this this far with -mm1, had too many problems with other things and 
been having other hassles such as dsl connection).
Somehow I doubt that these two cards are both genuinely faulty..........I can 
swap out with another e100 if need be.
New config is up at

Otherwise compiles, starts up and shuts down fine.
