No I don't. I've just used ntp for several years, back to when it was
xntp and a new thing to RedHat releases. I don't have anything to do
with Earthlink other than as a customer. I use Linux as the firewall
and mail service here as well as a general "let off steam" from doing
work on Windows that I can't do on Linux. (Matrox DigiSuite cards
feature heavily.)
