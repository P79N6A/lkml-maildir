And if the said meaningful tools introduce complex dependencies, then  
there should be an open discussion as to why exactly we need those  
tools as opposed to a simpler implementation.

I feel that if you attempted to look for discussions on "cross- 
compiling perl", you will meet with a variety of complaints on what a  
nightmare it is to do so in a sandboxed environment.

 From what I can tell, it allows one to fully build the Linux kernel  
without Perl. Without these series of patches, to actually *build* the  
kernel, one requires Perl. Unless there is an alternate way to do  
"make headers_install" that I am not seeing, that appears to now be  
done in Perl. All the other Perl scripts were merely nice to have, not  
necessary to build a Linux kernel.

Do I need that to compile a kernel? No.

Perl was not required to build the Linux kernel. Now it is. It adds  
another dependency to the Linux kernel. Requiring bash is far less a  
dependency that Perl is.

How is Perl a better tool for the job than what currently bash and  
other standard utilities already offer?
