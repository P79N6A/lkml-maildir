i've released the -T1 VP patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc3-mm2-T1
Changes since -T0:
 - added the read-lock fix from Hugh that affects SMP systems. This 
   could fix Rui's problem - i've checked -T1 on a P4/HT box and saw no 
   problems, BYMMV.
 - compilation fixes (for those who downloaded T0 early)
 - small tracer improvement
to build a -T1 tree from scratch the patching order is:
