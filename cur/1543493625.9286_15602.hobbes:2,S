It doesn't. It uses a separate process for each simulatenous request,
but each of these processes in their lifetime may server many
requests.

No, that would be insane. Perhaps use threads the way it now uses
processes, but not one thread per request -- that would be death as
far as performance goes.

Maybe... but there are still probably better ways of doing this at
the extreme high end anyhow (oh, and poll would probably be preferred
for gobs of FDs).

*BSD kernels can fork at a very high rate, as can linux, but neither
of them need to fork all that fast for reasons I've already outlined.
