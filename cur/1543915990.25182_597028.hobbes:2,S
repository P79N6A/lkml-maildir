This has been done by kexec/kdump guys. There is a makedumpfile utility
and vmcoreinfo kernel mechanism to implement this. We can just reuse the
work of kexec/kdump.

These can be done in user space. The image writing will be done in user
space for kexec base hibernation.

Yes. Device reinitialisation is needed. But all in all, kexec based
hibernation can be much simpler on the kernel side.

Configuration is a problem, we will work on it.
But, because it is based on kexec/kdump instead of starting from
scratch, the duplicated part between hibernation and kexec/kdump can be
eliminated.
