s/with NPTL//.  I'm fairly certain that fs/cifs went into the tree without
a review and what's more, in this case I have very strong suspicion that
it might have been deliberately obfuscated to scare potential reviewers off.
Whatever the cause might be, the code *is* obfuscated enough to make it very
hard to review and it certainly contains a lot of dubious stuff.

intermezzo needs a serious rewrite before it will be usable in 2.6.  Authors
had promised to do something about it, but so far it hadn't reached the Linus'
tree.

Doesn't even build.  Will need a rewrite or removal - it had been rotting
for a *long* time.
