Have you read the POSIX DRAFT rationale section?
Have you read any of the DRAFT, for that matter?
Breaking privilege apart from UID==0 and the
setuid mechanism while allowing a system that
could still work without requiring programs
to be rewritten took quite a while. The DRAFT
versions don't differ that greatly after about
DRAFT 12. The scheme has been implemented
several times.

The relationship between setuid and file based
capabilitiy sets is straitforward. There is
none. If your system supports root or capability
(like Irix) or strictly capability (like Trix)
the calculation is identical. There is a full
descrition of the rules in the DRAFT. If you
have questions about it, I'd be happy to dust
off my copy to help you understand it.
