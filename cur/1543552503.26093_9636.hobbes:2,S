Test10-pre4 (and up) can die on the new WP test as follows:
  Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor mode...
  <1>Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address c0000000
I examined the new WP code added to pre4 and even checked the exception 
table entries stored in vmlinux by it and it all looked fine.  Strange.
Well after a few handfuls of hair, it turns out that the new WP test code 
is a red herring - it just happens to be the first thing to cause a
fault and a lookup in the exception table.  
It turns out that also in pre4 was a patch to use non-continuous 
initialization of the elements in kernel_module.  And if modules are
enabled, the exception table for the kernel is obtained from the
kernel_module struct instead of directly.  Which is a problem as
gcc-2.7.2 (perhaps others too) now munges the loading of the struct
(it miscalculates the offsets), and voila - you have no exception table.
BTW, while looking at the new WP code, I noticed the "jmp 1f; 1:"
before and after are now gone - the comment above them (which lives on)
indicated they were Deep Magic(tm) to avoid some dark and mysterious
CPU bugs. I take it that science has prevailed over magic?  ;-)
Paul.
