Interesting.  Not had a report of that thus far.  Can you send me any
kernel messages relating to serial devices please, and the bad address

Weird.  Currently I've no idea what's causing this; I've been booting
machines with "console=ttyS0,115200n8" fine here with no noticable
problems.
Again, any useful kernel messages?
