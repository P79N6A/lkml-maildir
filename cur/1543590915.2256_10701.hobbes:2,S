Also note how a 32-bit (or 64-bit) dev_t does NOT make it any easier to
manage permissions or anything like that anyway. Look at the current mess
/dev is. Imagine it an order of magnitude worse.
Big device numbers are _not_ a solution. I will accept a 32-bit one, but
no more, and I will _not_ accept a "manage by hand" approach any more. The
time has long since come to say "No". Which I've done. If you can't make
it manage the thing automatically with a script, you won't get a hardcoded
major device number just because you're lazy.
End of discussion.
