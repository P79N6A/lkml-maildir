So your BIOS probably has a buggy PIRQ table.  
From page 155 of the CS5530 manual found at:
    
http://www.national.com/ds/CS/CS5530.pdf
Index 5Ch PCI Interrupt Steering Register 1 (R/W) Reset Value = 00h
7:4 INTB# Target Interrupt: Selects target interrupt for INTB#
3:0 INTA# Target Interrupt: Selects target interrupt for INTA#
Index 5Dh PCI Interrupt Steering Register 2 (R/W) Reset Value = 00h
7:4 INTD# Target Interrupt: Selects target interrupt for INTD#
3:0 INTC# Target Interrupt: Selects target interrupt for INTC#
So I have to switch that code around on most GX1 boards that I use or
I'll get a lot of messages about IRQ routing conflicts.
