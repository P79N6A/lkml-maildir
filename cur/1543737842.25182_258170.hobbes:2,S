Gawd. This is damn awful. How could this possibly be justified?
You can't have a system call that lies. We already have an OS
that does that. Certainly, no other Unix OS in the past has
thrown away integrity with such aplomb. Next, in the interest
of "performance", you'll probably only occasionally provide
file-data, as well.
You can't do this. When there is some well-defined procedure
such as select() or poll(), that is designed to provide a
reliable way of knowing that a read will succeed, you or
anybody else don't have the authority to declare that it's
not important to actually have it work.
