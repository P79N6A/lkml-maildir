Not to me. :-)

Well, I can configure the interfaces manually, with ifconfig, but the SUSE's
configuration tools don't work.  For example, "ifup eth0" tells me that
"No configuration found for eth0" and that's all.
Also, powersaved segfaults at startup so I think the problem is with hal
vs sysfs (again).
The output of dmesg after a fresh boot and the "strace ifup eth0" output
are attached.
