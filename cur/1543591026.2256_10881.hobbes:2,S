To find this out, you type:
# vi -t dget
and then look at the bottom line which would show
"./include/linux/dcache.h"
This assumes you have built the tags by:
# cd /usr/src/linux
# find -name '*.[ch]' | ctags -L- &
# echo "set tags=tags" >> .vimrc
And, btw, it is a static inline, not a function per se.
