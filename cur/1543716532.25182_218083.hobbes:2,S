readahead is currently the only means by which we build up nice large
multi-page BIOs.

That's one of its usage patterns.  It's also supposed to detect the
fixed-sized-reads-seeking-all-over-the-place situation.  In which case it's
supposed to submit correctly-sized multi-page BIOs.  But it's not working
right for this workload.
A naive solution would be to add special-case code which always does the
fixed-size readahead after a seek.  Basically that's
	if (ra->next_size == -1UL)
		force_page_cache_readahead(...)
in filemap.c.  But this means that the kernel does lots of pointless
pagecache lookups when everything is in pagecache.  We should detect this
situation and stop doing readahead completely, until we start getting
pagecache lookup misses again.

Readahead got itself turned off because of pagecache hits and didn't turn
itself on again.
