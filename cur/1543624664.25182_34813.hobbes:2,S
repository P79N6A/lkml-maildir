I see. So the trick is to fix hdparm and tell it not to use ioctl(fd, 
BLKRAGET, arg). But I don't think that the BIO changes introduce a means 
for readahead control/export from/to user space? Or would this be 
something like bio_ioctl(kdev_t, unsigned int, unsigned long), which is 
actually not used anywhere, or the request queue approach used by Andrew 
Morton?
The reason I was confused about the arch was that sparc64, ppc64, 
mips64, s390x and x86_64 still provide a ioctl handler for those ioctl's 
hooking up the the w_long (interestig naming concept btw) function.
Am I completely off the track here, mixing things up?
Best regards,
