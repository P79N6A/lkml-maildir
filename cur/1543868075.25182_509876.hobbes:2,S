It's not a solution per-se, though it contains elements of solution like
the reverse mappin, which I use to map HW numbers to virtual irqs but
can trivially adapt to map HW numbers to irq_desc pointers.
Among other things, I want to make sure that we don't end up with just
putting an irq number in a field of the irq_desc and have half of the
drivers peek at it and assume we can convert between irq_desc* and
number in arbitrary ways.
The HW irq number should be as much opaque as possible from the world
outside of the PIC code and/or arch code that assign them. That's an
area where the powerpc and/or sparc code might be of use.

Yes, but I'd like aspects of my remapping work to be included in
whatever we come up with, which is to have the new irq_desc either hide
the underlying HW number, or at least associate it make it very clear
that it's an opaque token and not guaranteed to be unique accross
multiple PICs in the system.
In addition, if we remove the numbers, archs will need basically the
exact same services provided by the powerpc irq core for reverse mapping
(going from a HW irq number on a given PIC back to an irq_desc *).
Either using a linear array for simple PICs or a radix tree for
platforms with very big interrupt numbers (BTW. I think we have lockless
radix trees nowadays, I can remove the spinlocks to protect it in the
powerpc remapper).
Ben.
