Is it fundamentally different _functionality_ to the stuff that is in "Plug 
and Play configuration" (which makes devices automatically get the right 
itnerrupts)?  [ Ignore implementation for a second - we can always solve this 
with another layer of abstraction. :-]
Of course, putting all this into the CPU menu (which is obviously a per-arch 
config.in change) would make drivers/arch/acpi/Config.in look a lot cleaner.
I'll try to work with Andy Grover off-list with this, and come up with an 
agreed position.
Rusty: This is starting to get a little non-trivial. Please drop the two 
patches I've sent. I'll get back to you later.
