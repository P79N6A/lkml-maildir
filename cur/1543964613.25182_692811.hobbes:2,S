Since there's no way we've found to date to get the TPC test to you,
how about we settle for analysing _this_ testcase which did show a
significant performance degradation for slub?
I don't think it's an unreasonable testcase either -- effectively it's
allocating memory on all CPUs and then freeing it all on one.  If that's
a worst-case scenario for slub, then slub isn't suitable for replacing
slab yet.
