Why not a /proc/something? I mean, doesn't glibc already have to handle in 
some way kernels not exporting certain information (in the same way it 
does for missing VDSO)?

With /proc/something you can have a single piece of code for all archs 
that exports NR_CPUS. The VDSO should be added to all missing archs. IMO 
performance is not an issue in getting NR_CPUS from userspace.
