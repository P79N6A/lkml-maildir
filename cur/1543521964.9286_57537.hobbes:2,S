 Great!!!, I have this video chip on my notebook, I have been working with
it at 1024x768x32 with the VesaFB driver for the console and the same
resolution on X with the SVGA server (these are the bigger resolution that
my TFT 14.1" can run at, with the external monitor I'm able to run at
bigger ones)
 What are the differences with the vesafb driver ??, speed ?, can I change
resolutions without needing to reboot ? May I use the in/out RCA
conectors, at least the out one to make Presentations with the notebook?
 If you need info about the chip, I have the .pdf with the specs (it may
be downloaded from the intel site), also if you need a beta-tester, plz
contact me.
 Have Fun.
