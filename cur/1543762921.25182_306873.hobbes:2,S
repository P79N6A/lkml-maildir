Vivek, perhaps a little more context about the background of the
changes would have helped here. Not everyone has been following
the details of fastboot/kdump discussion for the last few months. 
Let me give this a try - Eric/Vivek please pitch in and correct me,
where I go wrong since even I haven't been that tightly plugged
in all the time.
Sometime back kexec underwent a major redesign in some respect. This
was mainly in terms of the division of responsibilities between the 
kernel and user-space kexec-tools. For kdump in particular this also
had to do with the real groundwork being set for better integration
into kexec mainstream, and a more reliable and cleaner interface between
what happens in kexec-tools, in the old kernel's context and in the
new kernel's context. On the whole, a better world for all :)
However, at that time, when this new revamped kexec was integrated
into -mm, the corresponding kdump redesign was still pending -- which
is why the *old* crash dump patches in -mm were kind of irrelevant
and broken because they hadn't caught up with the kexec revamp. Which
is also why kdump wasn't being tested on -mm ... it didn't even work !
Sorting this all out is really what I see Vivek's latest patches being 
intended for -- and I believe it is the outcome of the work that has
been happening on fastboot over the last several months ?
This is why, I guess, it made sense for him to take the route of
throwing out most of the old patches and starting afresh with new
ones, because these are *built* on a different foundation altogether,
so incremental patches would have been rather confusing.
This should not be a continuing trend from here on (I hope not
at least, since major revamps are quite costly on stability !),
so shouldn't be a cause for worry. The bullet has been bitten. From
here on, changes must be incremental.
Regards
Suparna
