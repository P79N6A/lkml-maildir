Hello,
    Please send/cc responses to hamilton@sedsystems.ca
    We are using a custom modulator card with the Linux 2.2.16 kernel 
running on an IBM e-server (dual 2.8GHz, a lot of RAM). The modulator 
card uses interrupts to send data (the card has a large FIFO and 
interrupts when almost empty). The interrupt service routine re-fills 
the fifo. While it is re-filling the FIFO interrupts are disabled. We 
are noticing horrible clock skew.
    Can you tell me the frequency of timer interrupts used by the linux 
2.2.16 kernel on Intel x86 SMP platform. I want to know how long my 
interrupt service routine can leave the interrupt disabled.
    TIA
