Presently i'm in london uk for investment projects with my own share of the 
total sum.meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist 
me in transffering those funds despite that it failed us somehow.
Now contact my secretary his name is utobo email:utoboo1@yahoo.com

for all your past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter.i 
appreciated your efforts at that time very much.so feel free and get

to you.
Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the 
joy after all the sufferness at that time.in the moment, i'm very busy here
