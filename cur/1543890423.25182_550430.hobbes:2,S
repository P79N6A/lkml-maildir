Hmmm, either jffs2 thinks the zlib interfaces exposed through
include/linux/zlib.h are insufficient, or it isn't using zlib properly
(or at least the way it was supposed to be used :-)
Looking at fs/jffs2/compr_zlib.c, however, it just seems to be
an optimization -- skipping some checksum calculation if some
flag (PRESET_DICT) is absent from the input stream about to
be decompressed ...
This /looks/ like an optimization that might make sense for other
users of zlib too, in which case that entire check and
skip-the-checksum thing could actually be put into zlib proper. (?)

Moving PRESET_DICT to zlib.h robs lib/zlib_deflate/deflate.c from
being able to resolve that macro. FWIW, a dirty hack could be to
simply duplicate it in zlib.h. But then, implementation and interface
are decoupled for good reasons ...
