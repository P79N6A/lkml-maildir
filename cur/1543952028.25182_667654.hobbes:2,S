Hi Daniel - 
I was able to get the first 3 patches ported to the stable tree of 2.6.23, but there were compilation errors - fixed in the 4th patch in the stream I'll post next. Regardless of that, it still failed to boot on a 2-way AMD64. Do you have a set of these patches that builds correctly & boots! :-)
There are checkpatch.pl notices about your patches as well. In any event, like I said above, I'll post the 4 patches that get it to at least build properly. 
Alan
