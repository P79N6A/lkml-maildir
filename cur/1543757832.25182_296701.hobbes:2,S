Hi,
There were 2 versions of the psmouse-resend patch, the first one was
indeed producing worse results, the second one should work better.
Could you please try grabbing the patch against 2.6.10 from here:
http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/input/2_6_10/
and letting me know if it gives better results.
Thanks!
