Hi,
Sorry if I'm duplicating the issue, but I've searched the list and didn't find 
a similar report. I've just compiled 2.6.20-rc4 and I have trouble booting. 
After some investigation, I find out that my IDE chipset is being discovered 
as SATA, so my hard drive is not /dev/hda, but /dev/sda. When I passed the 
correct root=/dev/sdaX option to the kernel, it booted fine and everything 
seems to be working. But it puzzles me why, this motherboard doesn't even 
have a SATA chipset. Is this abug or a new feature? :) My IDE chipset is:
00:09.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation nForce2 IDE (rev a2)
Regards,
DImitar G. Katerinski
