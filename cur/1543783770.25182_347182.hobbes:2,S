Subject: 2.6.13 locks my machine within 1h, 2.6.12.5 works fine (PREEMPT?)

Hi,
I had 2.6.13 lock my machine three times within a hour each after
upgrading to 2.6.13 (last time within 5 minutes).  The machine was
running 2.6.12.5 (and earlier releases) without any problems, so I'd
suspect it's not a hardware issue.  Problem is that I don't find any
trace of this lockup anywhere in the usual logfiles.  Symptoms are that
screen, keyboard and network is frozen (i.e no screen refresh, even
numlock does no longer toggles the light, and ping from another machine
does not work anymore).  This is a standard 2.6.13 kernel running on
Debian unstable.  New features I enabled were INOTIFY and
PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY instead of PREEMPT:
diff -U0 =(grep '^C' /boot/config-2.6.12.5 | sort) =(grep
'^C' /boot/config-2.6.13 | sort) | grep '^.C'
-CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y
+CONFIG_ACPI_FAN=m
+CONFIG_ACPI_VIDEO=m
+CONFIG_FLATMEM=y
+CONFIG_FLATMEM_MANUAL=y
+CONFIG_FLAT_NODE_MEM_MAP=y
-CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK=y
+CONFIG_HWMON=y
+CONFIG_HZ=250
+CONFIG_HZ_250=y
+CONFIG_INOTIFY=y
+CONFIG_IP_FIB_HASH=y
-CONFIG_LOCK_KERNEL=y
+CONFIG_NFS_COMMON=y
-CONFIG_PNP=y
-CONFIG_PNPACPI=y
+CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000

-CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
-CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
+CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
+CONFIG_SELECT_MEMORY_MODEL=y
+CONFIG_TCP_CONG_BIC=y
I know that that's most likely not enough to pinpoint the problem, so I
think I need to get more information from the lockup itself.  What's the
best way to do this?  As the keyboard is locked up too, even Alt-SysRq
does not work.
Best,
  Norbert
