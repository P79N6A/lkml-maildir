argggh.... couldn't they keep the rutgers.edu to be valid... or keep
redhat.com - it's much easier to remember than kernel.org :)

Subject: pagecache sysctl ignored?
Hi guys,
I always suspected that Linux VM is perfect but the apparent horrible
performance thereof is merely due to bad choice of default tunables. Now,
I changed /proc/sys/vm/pagecache to be "2 15 50" but I still see pagecache
taking up more than 99% of my memory (instead of 50 or 65?). So I grepped
the source and see that the tunable is in fact totally ignored.
Is this what needs to be done to solve all so-called "Linux VM problems"?
I.e. to find which parts of pagecache code need to be aware of the
pagecache tunable (defined in mm/swap.c)?
Regards,
Tigran
