Subject: [PATCH] turn err into errx in lguest call sites
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/21/325

These two callsites should really be errx instead of err, since there is
no errno associated with them in the moment they are issued.
