Andries,
I changed the drive setting to "AUTO" in the CMOS for this drive, and now
the drive reports 850/63/64.  It is interesting to note that there was no
setting for this disk device that matched any of the configurations you gave
me.  Long ago I wrote an IDE driver on Netware (Wolf Mountain), so I am
aware of the ability to translate drives into other logical geometries and
am very famliar with low level IDE stuff (unfortunately).  The one thing
that sucks about IDE and ATA is that both use IO port reads and writes to
transfer data to and from the disk (which sucks up a lot of bus cycles).
It's better, however, to get this type of info to the right folks who
maintain the driver.  There are several IDE drivers out there on other OS's
that for some reason did not implement the new commands for EIDE when they
came out.  I try to focus on the stuff I am supposed to be working on and
not trying to fix everyone else's bugs, but report then to them instead.  I
did not know if there were underlying hardware issues that I was unaware of
since it's been about two years since I did any IDE work.  I thought someone
else may be more recently on top of it (like you).
Thanks for the help.  I am relieved to know that the Linux IDE drivers are
not busted and don''t have any cross platform issues that will cuase
different OS's to report different geometry.
Thanks,
Jeff
