Hi,
I am trying to find out how long it takes to push packet off the NIC in
8139_tx_interrupt(){} (kernel 2.4.20)
but i don't know how to identify packet in this loop - i know that "entry"
stands for the packet but in the loop underneath:
/* code snippet for 8139_tx_interrupt(){}*/
1726         while (tx_left > 0) {
1727                 int entry = dirty_tx % NUM_TX_DESC;
1728                 int txstatus;
...
1762
1763                 dirty_tx++;
1764                 tx_left--;    // <- is single packet sent just
here??????
1765         }
what "tx_left" and "dirty_tx" variables stand for? Is single iteration
through the loop (lines 1726-1765) related to SINGLE packet transmission?
I wanted to put some probes inside tx_interrupt but not sure where it should
start/stop measuring to show single packet transmission time.
regards
adam
