Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] Fix misrouted interrupts deadlocks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While testing kernel on machine with "irqpoll" option
I've caught such a lockup:
	__do_IRQ()
	   spin_lock(&desc->lock);
           desc->chip->ack(); /* IRQ is ACKed */
	note_interrupt()
	misrouted_irq()
	handle_IRQ_event()
           if (...)
	      local_irq_enable_in_hardirq();
	/* interrupts are enabled from now */
	...
	__do_IRQ() /* same IRQ we've started from */
	   spin_lock(&desc->lock); /* LOCKUP */
Looking at misrouted_irq() code I've found that a potential
deadlock like this can also take place:
1CPU:
__do_IRQ()
   spin_lock(&desc->lock); /* irq = A */
misrouted_irq()
   for (i = 1; i < NR_IRQS; i++) {
      spin_lock(&desc->lock); /* irq = B */
      if (desc->status & IRQ_INPROGRESS) {
2CPU:
__do_IRQ()
   spin_lock(&desc->lock); /* irq = B */
misrouted_irq()
   for (i = 1; i < NR_IRQS; i++) {
      spin_lock(&desc->lock); /* irq = A */
      if (desc->status & IRQ_INPROGRESS) {
As the second lock on booth CPUs is taken before checking that
this irq is being handled in another processor this may cause
a deadlock. This issue is only theoretical.
I propose the attached patch to fix booth problems: when trying
to handle misrouted IRQ active desc->lock may be unlocked.
Please comment.
