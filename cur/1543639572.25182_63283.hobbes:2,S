	I am also experiencing modules not working with CONFIG_PREEMPT
set, and deactivating CONFIG_PREEMPT works around the problem for me too.
	Ryan, thanks for suggesting that, as it would have taken me a
long time to narrow it down that far!
	It would help avoid duplication of effort if you could indicate
how along you are with this problem.  If you or someone else has nailed
the problem and is preparing a patch, then there is no point in anyone
else trying to duplicate that debugging effort.  On the other hand,
if you just noticed CONFIG_PREEMPT was the difference between your
configuration and that of someone else who was running 2.5.31 successfully
and are not actively debugging the problem, then I'll try to poke at it
some more.
	I already know that the error that trips insmod occurs at
in modules.c, line 831, when qm_symbols gets an error from copy_to_user():
        for (; i < mod->nsyms ; ++i, ++s, vals += 2) {
                len = strlen(s->name)+1;
                if (len > bufsize)
                        goto calc_space_needed;
here------>     if (copy_to_user(strings, s->name, len)
                    || __put_user(s->value, vals+0)
                    || __put_user(space, vals+1))
                        return -EFAULT;
                strings += len;
                bufsize -= len;
                space += len;
        }
	The values of strings and s->name are similar in 2.5.30+preempt
(works) and 2.5.31+preempt (does not work).  strings is 0x08______, and
s->name is 0xc0______.
