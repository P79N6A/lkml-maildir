I have no trouble with other non-commercial licenses - in fact we have
donated a bunch of them to universities. We use GPL for the same reason
you do.
What I do have trouble with is arguments like:
	"I am a 100% GPL advocate and my only thought is the greater
	good of all human kind and the glory of Free Software. However,
	in order to advance Free Software, it is my sad duty to 
	attach non-GPL proprietary code to your code released under GPL
	and to derived versions.  Of course, I may reluctantly 
        take money for doing this work, but it's not the money that counts,
	it is my pure motivation - according to me. "
I have heard literally thousands of such arguments in the last 4 years.
