configured ready to compile 2.4 or 2.6 kernel source tree linked to /usr/src/linuxtest
/tmp directory and/or $TEMP set to a user writable temporary directory
200MB spare disk space
How to use:
$ ln -s /usr/src/yourlinux /usr/src/linuxtest
$ tar jxf ti-tests.tar.bz2
to start the test:
$ ti-tests/ti 1
to stop the test
$ ti-tests/ti 0
