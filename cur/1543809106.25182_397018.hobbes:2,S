I did a quick git bisect search. This is one is the hurting one:

    [PATCH] Fix spinlock debugging delays to not time out too early
    
    The spinlock-debug wait-loop was using loops_per_jiffy to detect too long
    spinlock waits - but on fast CPUs this led to a way too fast timeout and false
    messages.
    
    The fix is to include a __delay(1) call in the loop, to correctly approximate
    the intended delay timeout of 1 second.  The code assumes that every
    architecture implements __delay(1) to last around 1/(loops_per_jiffy*HZ)
    seconds.

I guess we're once again suffering from being a virtualized platform: the
formerly used call to cpu_relax() informed the underlying hypervisor that
we want to give up the current cpu while __delay() keeps it.
Unless we're scheduled away involuntarily.
The "Detect Soft Lockups" option doesn't make too much sense too on our
platform, since we get a lot of false positives.
Quick fix: turn off the options CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK and
CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP.
