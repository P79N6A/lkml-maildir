I noticed that KDE 3.1.1 was noticably slower to start on 2.5.69 than 2.4.21-rc1
when I briefly tested it on an Athlon XP 2200+ with 512 MB of RAM.
(Unfortunaly I haven't had much time for 2.5 testing, or any testing actually,
for a few months, but I tested it briefly when I first built this machine,
before it went in to production use.  Once all the security issues are addressed
in the 2.5 tree, I intend to start using it on a few production boxes, though).
John.
