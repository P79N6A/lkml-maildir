Obvious comments explaining _what_ the code is doing are annoying. 
They're fluff.  You can see what the code is doing.
The critical comments are the ones that explain _why_ and _how_.  The 
comments should give the higher level view as to the rationale for that 
code.
Of course if you've got some highly-optimized bit of black magic there 
had better be some good comments explaining what's going on...but there 
should also be some comments explaining why we need the magic in the 
first place.
