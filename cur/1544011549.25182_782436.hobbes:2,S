Currently bitmap_find_free_region() assumes, that the requested region 
size is smaller than the entire bitmap. If this is not the case it fails 
to detect it and returns success, while pointing at a position outside of 
the region.

It is hard to believe, that this is a bug, last time this code was touched 
in 2006... Or should the caller guarantee, that the requested region is 
not larger than the bitmap? Then dma_alloc_from_coherent() is buggy, which 
is where I hit this bug. But it seems to me bitmap_find_free_region() 
should be fixed.
