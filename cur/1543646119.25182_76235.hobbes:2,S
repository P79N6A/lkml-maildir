Yupp, that wasn't accidental.
Based on the conclusions mutually agreed on in the OLS
BOF on bio splitting, it was decided that each driver
having the need to split bios *should* have their own
private bio pools to use exclusively for this purpose.
Thus any plugin that includes this header gets their
own private copies of these variables.

I agree. I've seen a few other static versions of the
same thing floating around.

Alan already questioned this as well... and I agree. I've
already made the necessary changes.

There may likely be generic code to perform bio splitting
at some (hopefully soon) point in time. I'm not even going
to assume that what EVMS has done will or should be it.
This support was a temporary implementation that does
allow several plugins in EVMS to work correctly with the
large I/Os now available in 2.5. I do agree, what ever is
done should be placed in some commonly usable location.
