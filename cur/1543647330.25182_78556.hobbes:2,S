   Make a CONFIG_xxx option that means what s390 wants it to mean, and no, 
   I'm not going to accept it if you #define that by hand in some .c file. It 
   needs to be in the architecture config file, like all the other config 
   options.
I understand what you want.
He's just trying to kill all this duplicate code we have on
s390x/ppc64/sparc64/etc. which does UID16 stuff for the 32-bit
compat case 
So maybe what you're saying is some "asm/uid16.h" that
conditionalizes?
