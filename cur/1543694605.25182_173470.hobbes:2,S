This patch actually doesn't work, as is uses nr_free_buffer_pages() before the 
zonelists are set up. So min_free_kbytes is always set to 128.
The attached fix works here without a problem, but I'm not sure it doesn't 
break anything...

P.S.: 1. I've got a ported memsetup-fix from the 2.4 tree, if you want I could 
send it to you.
2. Should we consider replacing the bogus int_sqrt() with the fb_sqrt() 
version? (btw. it is always exact) We could place it somewhere central, so it 
can be used from any place...
