nice for me means all values <5ms
:-)
Unfortunately I seem to have no luck, I applied a patch from Roger (an enhanced
version of Anrea's patch) + Mingo's patch on a 2.2.10 kernel  , but on my
PII400 + IBM 16GB EIDE disk I still get SUBOPTIMAL values:  :-(
gfx: 2.9ms (0)
proc: 9.1 (101)
disk write 49ms (9)
disk copy 31ms (27)
disk read: 13ms (7)
substantially the patched did not improve much my results,
maybe the next patch from Mingo will make things better,
since he wrote me he is fighting with latencies between 2-4ms  :-) 
ciao,
Benno.
