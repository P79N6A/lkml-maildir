Wow... with what gcc version? My 4.1.2 correctly recognises, that it 
_doesn't_ get used uninitialised.

Thanks, great! Don't know what's better, let's see what Sascha says. But 
there's one small problem with the patch 2/4: it breaks compilation on 
i.MX31 if IPU is _not_ set, so, default imx31 configs would break:-( The 
problem is, that I use CONFIG_MX3_IPU_IRQS unconditionally in calculation 
of NR_IRQ. The easiest for me is to fix it in mx31.h like
#ifdef CONFIG_MX3_IPU_IRQS
#define MX3_IPU_IRQS CONFIG_MX3_IPU_IRQS
#else
#define MX3_IPU_IRQS 0
#endif
but that's less than elegant:-) A probably better solution would be to fix 
this in Kconfig, best would be to show
config MX3_IPU_IRQS
	int "..."
if MX3_IPU is set and hide it otherwise, setting to 0... But I don't know 
off hand how to do this properly. Hm, looks like the following works:
config MX3_IPU_IRQS
	int "Number of dynamically mapped interrupts for IPU"
	depends on MX3_IPU
	range 2 137
	default 4
	help
	  Out of 137 interrupt sources on i.MX31 IPU only very few are used.
	  To avoid bloating the irq_desc[] array we allocate a sufficient
	  number of IRQ slots and map them dynamically to specific sources.
config MX3_IPU_IRQS
	int
	default 0
	depends on !MX3_IPU
Would it be considered a proper Kbuild (ab)use?
Thanks
