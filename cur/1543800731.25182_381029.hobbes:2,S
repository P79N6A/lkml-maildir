Yes, blame me for udev.  Again, a kernel change caused a udev bug to
surface.  This is the problem with 2.6.15 and input devices that are not
the aggregated mice or keyboards.  A one-line fix to udev solved this.
Again, the fault was in udev, not the kernel, I'm not going to prevent
kernel changes from going in, when it is stupid userspace bugs, not the
kernel's fault.
And yes, this is the second time this has happened, it seems that I suck
at userspace programming :)
