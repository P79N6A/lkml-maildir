Simply that is easier to provide segments that are not fit to be
reloaded before the kernel sets up it's own GDT.  Then to ensure you
stick a GDT someplace that won't get stomped.
Especially before we froze which segments numbers the kernel
would load into the boot protocol.  I would have used this in
places where I was doing 32bit bootloader work as it is just easier to
support.
