This morning i tried Andrew Morton's kernel which implements the via-tsc-fix 
(
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0/2.6.0-mm1/broken-out/via-tsc-fix.patch
)
the messages are still here (Unknown HZ value! (77) Assume 100.) but after doing 
some comparison with my home workstation which has almost the same hardware the 
speed seems to be returned on the standards.
Regards.
