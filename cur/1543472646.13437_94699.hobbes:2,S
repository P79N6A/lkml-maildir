There are "standard" 1.88Mb in OS/2. mtools has support for it. Really weird
format really: first track use 512 byte sectors, most tracks use 1K sectors, etc.
Looks like 2K floppy from Windows9x :-)

Confirmed. This is really weird since "real" 720k format (created with
pu_1700.com and MS DOS (any version including 7.x from Windows 9x (NOT from
GUI! Use F8 and "Command Prompt Only"): just run `pu_1700 /sm=2` from
ftp://ftp.sch57.msk.ru/users/khim/pu_1700/pu_1700.arj
 and then
`format b:/t:80/n:9` for 720K and `format b:/t:80/n:18` for 1440K) is ok both
with Windows 9x and Linux ! Even 830K (format b:/t:83/n:10) is ok with both
Linux (mtools, not just mount, unfortunatelly) and Windows 9x !!! I'm still
have quite a few 720K, 830K and 1440K floppies and use them extensively with
Windows9x (720K and 830K are DD floppies and 1440K are HD floppies;
1440 vs 1200 is not big difference but this is usefull to make diskcopy
(from MS DOS 7.x, not Windows9x) from 3" disks to 5" disks).

This is VERY strange since both fd?d360 and fd?h360 are for 5" drives (double
and high density); fd?D360 and fd?H360 are for 3" drives (double and high
density -- in fact they are equal on hardware level :-)

They are HARDWARE-COMPATIBLE (at least they are SHOULD BE hardware-compatible).
At least on my system they are really hardware compatible for sure...

I'm does not have MS-DOS 3.10 here but I'll try to check with 3.30 :-))
Which parameters for format there are should be ?

Yes, they are not compatible but both fd?d360 and fd?h360 are for 5" drives !
fd?d360 is for double-density floppies and fd?h360 are for high-density ...
fd?D360 and fd?H360 are for 3" drives...

Hm. I'm still could not understood why "real" 720K (or 830K :-) drive is ok
with both Windows9x and Linux while simulated one is ok with Linux but not with
Windows 9x ...
