I just ran it on my laptop 20 times in a row and it printed exactly the
same values every time:
	Kernel reports clock frequency:  366.601 MHz
	Measured clock frequency:        366.584 MHz
Well we need more precision than that.  So here goes:

It takes the median of 1000 samples of the TSC time taken to do a
rdtsc/gettimeofday/rdtsc measurement, then uses that as the threshold
for deciding which of the subsequent 1000000 measurements are accepted.
Then linear regression through the accepted points.
I see a couple of results there which suggests a probable fault in the
filtering algorithm.  Perhaps it should simply use the smallest TSC time
taken as the threshold.
Sorry, I'd need permission to post the code.
enjoy,
