The first most useful part would be understand what your pty driver does
and is required that is not in the base one. Just an idea of what extra
APIs it provides would be quite useful. If it is stuff like virtual modem
lines then that is stuff I want to see supported in the base kernel
anyway.

By chance.. as to policies about kernel recompiles, that is between you
and the vendors. Maybe the vendors will add the symbols to their tree for
you ?
Equally look at the positives - if the facilities you need are in the
base kernel your customers won't run into arguments between yourselves
and the base kernel vendor over support.
