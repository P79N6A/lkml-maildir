because it's not just an open-coded __tlb_flush_all(), it _disables PGE 
and keeps it so while the MTRR's are changed on all CPUs_.
Your patch adds __flush_tlb_all() which re-enables the PGE bit in cr4, 
see asm-x86/tlbflush.h:
        /* clear PGE */
        write_cr4(cr4 & ~X86_CR4_PGE);
        /* write old PGE again and flush TLBs */
        write_cr4(cr4);
so we'll keep PGE enabled during the MTRR setting - which changes 
behavior.
