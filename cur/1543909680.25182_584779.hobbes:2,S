A minimum enforced reclaimable non dirty threshold wouldn't be
that ridiculous though. So the memory could be used, just not
for dirty data.
His patchkit essentially turns the GFP_ATOMIC requirements 
from free to easily reclaimable. I see that as an general improvement.
I remember sct talked about this many years ago and it's still
a good idea.
