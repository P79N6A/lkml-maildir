Very likely, and they will bloat maps/smaps/pmaps alike :(

The implementation gets offset from page_index(page), so will work
the same way in linear/nonlinear VMAs. Depending how one does the
remap_file_ranges() calls, the output lines may be not strictly
ordered by offset, or overlap, or have small page ranges.
