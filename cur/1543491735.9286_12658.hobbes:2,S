Hi there,
I hope somebody out there can read this. I did not see any mails from
linux-kernel in the last 2 days. There seems to be a major problem
with .de domains. I asked many people subscribed to the list and they
all confirm that. They also use different ISPs.
Can anyone comment on that and Cc me ???
cheers,
Patrick
