Is there any reason for avoiding this treatment to %gs, apart that TLS code 
usually does not need it, even if the API allows for it to exist? I _do_ 
believe this patch fixes bug which can be tested (not verified everything), 
even if I wonder why you didn't look at the patch I sent to you time ago (I 
hadn't finished it, in truth, but there was most stuff - it had problems I 
couldn't debug at that time).
