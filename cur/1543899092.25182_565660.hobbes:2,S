It's the fourth time I'm repeating this in this thread:
Yes adding try_to_freeze() there would partially solve the probelem.
But another task can be sleeping on a mutex held by the task waiting
for the reply.  And the freezer won't be able to handle that one.
Generally, calling try_to_freeze() with mutexes held is not a good
idea.
