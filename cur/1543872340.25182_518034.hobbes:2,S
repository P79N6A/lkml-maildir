Writes to a pipe/FIFO are atomic, so long as they fit within the pipe buffer 
size, while f_pos on a pipe is undefined -- what exactly is the issue here?  
The semantics you're assuming are not defined by POSIX.  Heck, even looking 
at a man page for one of the *BSDs states "Some devices are incapable of 
seeking.  The value of the pointer associated with such a device is 
undefined."  What part of undefined is problematic?

I hope I don't have to run any of your software.  Short writes can and do 
happen because of a variety of reasons: signals, memory allocation failures, 
quota being exceeded....  These are all error conditions the kernel has to 
provide well defined semantics for, as well behaved applications will try 
to handle them gracefully.

The semantics you're looking for are defined for regular files with 
O_APPEND.  Anything else is asking for synchronization that other 
applications do not require and do not desire.
