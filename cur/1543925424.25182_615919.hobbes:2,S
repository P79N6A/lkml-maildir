Does that work for alpha too?

No, that's a logic rathole down which I will not follow :)
You can make any argument along those lines command line usage is really 
an art, not a science.  Its a user interface, and that involves human 
taste rather than logic.
I've been bouncing between architectures using ARCH= for years, and my 
fingers and brain have been trained.  It's just disappointing and a pain 
to change this nice user interface that has served so well for years.
This is /not/ a cleanup, it's a user interface change.
