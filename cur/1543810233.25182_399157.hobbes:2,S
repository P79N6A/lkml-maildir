Subject: RE: [RFC] [PATCH 1/2] Driver to remember ethernet MAC values: maclist
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/20/235

My latest version of this patch is here:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/nslu/kernel/2.6.15/91-maclist.patch?rev=1.2&only_with_tag=HEAD&view=markup
In "Recommendations" "With the second strategy" should be "With
the first strategy".
(Note that the '2.6.16' directory in that repo contains an old
version - it is, in fact, rev 1.1 from the 2.6.15 directory.)
