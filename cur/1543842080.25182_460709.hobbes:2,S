There's definitely a problem here.  We have three users of
scsi_alloc_target() in scsi_scan.c; two seem to assume they have to get
the device and the third assumes the device is pre-got.

This is spot on.

This would fix it, but a better fix is simply to move the
put_device(parent) within the if().  In general, you never want to drop
and re-acquire a reference if you can avoid it, otherwise you have to
worry about you doing a last put and the device being released before
the get.
How does the attached work (I also corrected a potential reap problem)?
