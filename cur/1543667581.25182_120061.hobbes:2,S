Ok, I'm slightly confused now, what is the difference between the "dev_t 
space" and the "kdev_t space"? The answer I'd like to hear is: none.
A difference might be the encoding, that's why I mentioned the ext2 
example. How will be e.g. 0x0301 encoded on disk with your changes?
So far I understood kdev_t as a marker, which has to be replaced with 
either struct block_device or char_device, so that at some point kdev_t 
goes away completely. (Especially Al did some great work here with the 
block layer.) You removed now part of this work by removing the i_cdev 
pointer from the inode. What will you replace it with?

I'd prefer to have the discussion now, as I still don't know what we need 
ranges or even subranges for. What problem are you trying to solve?

I don't care much about the specific major/minor encoding, I want to know 
how it will be used at the kernel level.
