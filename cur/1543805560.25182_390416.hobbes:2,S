That matches my experience, though it does crash enough on its own that I 
often don't have to kill it.  I also use an rlimit (64MiB) to make the 
system kill it automatically before it gets too big, and an automatic 
restarter.  Opera is, thankfully, very good at bouncing back to exactly 
where it was when it died (minus the leaked memory).
But allowing for that extra operational procedure, I'd still say it has 
the most features per byte, and if you don't count ability to work with 
certain websites as a feature, I think it probably has the most features 
absolutely as well.
