Hello everyone,
I have a reproducible (and rather quick) oops on a system running
linux-2.4.10-ac3, which seems to be NFS (v3) related; although
ksymoops core dumps when I try to use it, I have manually decoded
the dump to indicate that it happens in rwsem_down_read_failed
called from nfs_file_wite.  Rather than posting too much here,
I have put as much information as I have been able to gather at:
ftp://ftp.zytor.com/pub/hpa/oops/
This includes the configuration, System.map, oops text etc.
