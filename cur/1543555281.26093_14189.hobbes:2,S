	Hi everybody!
	I'm developing a module of file system filter and I have a question about
it. Does anybody know a function or method in order to translate an user
space pointer into a valid pointer in kernel mode?
	I'd like to avoid copying data (such as the 'copy_to_user' and
'copy_from_user' functions do) because it slows down my system.
	Thanks in advance,
	Rubén.
