Hi Adam. I am working right now on improving acpi idle. However, I'm
somewhat confused by the trace below which includes:
> ACPI: System description tables not found
The ACPI driver's thread *should* then exit, and never register as the idle
handler. My next update will also have some more diagnostic printk's so
hopefully that will help, because right now I can't see how we can be
failing to find tables, yet still registering as the idle handler.
I'll look at it tomorrow morning, and maybe then it will be obvious. ;-)
Regards -- Andy
