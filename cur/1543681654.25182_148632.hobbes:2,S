Yes, that was back then :-) Later, after I installed the Debian package
module-init-tools, everything worked fine. I only thought the package
was needed to *load* the modules, not create them. So, everything works
now. Thanks to everyone who answered to this thread and of course to the
Linux kernel team for creating, maintaining and developing the kernel
:-)
