	At Linuxcare I have written a multi-path system for Linux 2.2.x
to support Sun's T3 hardware. It's pretty generic, though. (A user
in Europe has reported success with the IBM Shark SAN with our 
SCSI Alias Chains failover system).
	For source code, please see:

	Please contact me by email if you're interested in a version for 2.4.x.
