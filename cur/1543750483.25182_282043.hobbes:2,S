Well, you also won't find sys_connect as these are all wrapped in
sys_socketcall. For intel, it turns out that it has been decided to wrap all
sem*() calls in sys_ipc().
./asm-i386/unistd.h:#define __NR_ipc		117
The 'royal way' to figure these things out is to trace the path from
semget() in libc to the kernel. You can download glibc from the GNU site I
think.
Good luck!
