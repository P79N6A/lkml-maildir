For some reason, xplaycd will hang my alpha when I try to play
a CDROM. This is true of I use the IDE or the SCSI drive. (Yes,
I have both, no I don't have a soundcard.) 2.2.0-pre4 is working
just fine.
2.2.1 will just crash xplaycd, but still no tunes. I can look a
little harder, but was wondering if this is a known problem.
