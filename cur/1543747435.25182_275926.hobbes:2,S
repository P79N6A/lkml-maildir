Okay - So the dma_pool_destroy problem can be solved by schedule_work() (that's what I think allows to create and schedule work queues, correct me if I am wrong). For allocation - I think it cannot be scheduled as the driver needs memory then and there.  How can that be handled? (dma_pool_create doesn't seem to be taking any flags like SLAB_ATOMIC - which would have solved the problem..)
Thanks!
