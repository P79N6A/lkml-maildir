I think that you and I are in total agreement.  I think #1 is the first
big barrier.  The problem is that I haven't seen a concrete list of the
deficiencies in OpenGL.  Before we can even consider how to extend the
API, we need to know where it needs to be extended.
I'd really like to see a list of areas where OpenGL isn't up to snuff
for 2D operations.  Ideally, items on this list would be put in one (or
more) of four categories:  missing (support for the required operation
is flat out missing from OpenGL), cumbersome (OpenGL can do it, but it
requires API acrobatics), ill defined (OpenGL can do it, but the spec
gives implementation enough leeway to make it useless for us), or slow
(OpenGL can do it, but the API overhead kills performance).
Having such a list would give us direction for both #1 and #3 in Alan's
list.
