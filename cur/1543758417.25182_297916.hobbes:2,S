I did, not for this problem though. The code this idea comes from sends
batched events of skb passing points to userspace. Not every call
invokes has_listeneres() but rather the kernel thread processing the
ring buffer sending the events to userspaces does. The result is
globally cached in a atomic_t making it possible to check for it at
zero-cost and really saving time and effort. I have no clue wether it
does make sense in this case I just pointed out how to do it properly
at my point of view.

I wasn't involved in the discussion either.
Using rtmsg_ifinfo as example, the check should probably go in straight
at the beginning _IFF_ rtmsg_ifinfo was subject to performance overhead
which obviously isn't the case but just served as an example.
