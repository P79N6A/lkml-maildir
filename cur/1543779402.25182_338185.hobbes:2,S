It only gets picked up by the other CPU's D-cache (which is fully
coherent between cores). The I-cache needs to be invalidated on each
CPU.

Why wouldn't the lazy dcache flushing method work? My understanding is
that if there is no user mapping for a given page, there's no reason
to flush the dcache and just postpone it until the page is faulted
in. When the page fault occurs the dcache should be flushed (on one
CPU is enough) and the icache invalidated on all the CPUs.
