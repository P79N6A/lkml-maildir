No, you are corrupting the library by inserting a "man in the middle".
The man in the middle needs resources and can only steal them
because he doesn't have his own context.

Search existing drivers for "kernel_thread"
		.../linux/drivers/net/8139too.c is a start.
And yes, kernel threads work. Pay particular attention to the
way to run one down before you remove your module. They can
do everything user-mode code can do and have the priviliges to
totally screw up anything and everything in the kernel.

Wrong. The kernel was designed to perform services on behalf of
a user-mode task. That's how it will function the fastest. There is
no "speed advantage" to kernel mode, only the lack of memory
and instruction protection. None of these kernel mode instructions
have anything to do with speed (except the ability to STOP everything)
with cli;hlt. Then you have no speed at all.

Common problem when persons first see the kernel code. They say;
"Oh it's just 'C'! I can write this. I know 'C'! Next thing you
know, they are trying to read/write files inside the kernel.
Before you write kernel code, you need to understand what the
kernel DOES.  Bottom line, it does the stuff that user-mode
code isn't allowed to do on its own. For instance, user mode
code can't be allowed to read/write files on its own because
(1) it doesn't know how to do it, and (2) it could screw up
the entire file-system either accidentally or on purpose.
Therefore the  kernel does it for the user task, but on behalf of the
user.
