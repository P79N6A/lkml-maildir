I observed such behaviour when the Processor Type didn't
match the actual hardware ... I do not assume that you
configured the wrong Processor, but IMHO it could be
possible that the selected Type doesn't match on those
systems ... therefor I would suggest to try with 386
just for the fun of doing it ...
