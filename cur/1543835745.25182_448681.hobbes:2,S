It's not the default. The default is all args come from the
bootloader.
At the risk of repeating myself, here are all possible features and
behaviors carefully enumerated again:
Possible features:
a) allow dealing with bootloaders that don't pass arguments
b) allow dealing with bootloaders that pass bogus arguments
c) allow dealing with bootloaders that run up against length limits
d) allow dealing with bootloaders where changing arguments dynamically
   is difficult
e) provide friendly defaults
Possible behaviors:
1) command line overrides built-in (won't work with b, works with the
rest)
2) built-in overrides command line (not so great for e, works with the
rest)
3) command line appends to built-in (generally broken as our command
parser can't arbitrarily override earlier arguments in most cases)
4) built-in appends to command line (same story)
Now I basically think behavior (e) is worthless. Embedded folks don't
care if the kernel's friendly and it's a solved problem for distros
too. Anyone else is building a kernel for themselves and don't need
defaults.
By comparison, the value of (b) is that you can control things you
otherwise can't.

Yes. They should all clearly do (2).
