to my mind this would be brilliant, but i don't remember every whinging
about bk ;).
The only requirements that would need to be fulfilled for it to go into
debian, would be source, a licence that does not restrict the usage of
the code/ package, and a distinct lack of invariant sections in the
license. (a real debian developer can probably elaborate better than i)

last time i tried the cvs gateway, i think i had trouble getting a full
shadow.. I should try again really, but i would hope that the
openBKClient could be faster, better and more modern (oh, and sexy too)
(and would mean that you don't need the cvs gateway anymore!)

yep. and for me, until i do some actual kernel development (unlikely as
i just can't find the time), this is all i think i want - i should be
able to do a bit more testing this way.
