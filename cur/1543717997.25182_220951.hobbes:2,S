 The Adaptec Ultra320 cards (aic79xx) do not work reliably on Tyan Thunder
motherboards. Lots of SCSI errors and eventually complete system lockup.
I guess those motherboards have a crappy PCI bus with a lot of noise
that can't cope with the high transfer speed of these SCSI cards.
 I suggest you try an Ultra160 card. We have 3 Tyan Thunder based systems
here (those are dual Athlon MP2800) that work fine with Adaptec Ultra160
cards (aic7xxx) but give lots of errors with the Ultra320 cards.
