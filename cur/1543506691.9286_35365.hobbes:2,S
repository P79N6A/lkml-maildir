It's happened to me, twice in the last two weeks:
2.2.10 kernel, BT Speedway Card (a rebadged AVM A1 PCI) using
isdn-9907301100.tar.gz
isdn4k-utils-9907311100.tar.gz
Prior to 2 Aug, I was running a different kernel (2.2.5) and different ISN
software (no idea what date).
Both times the lock up occured when disconnecting although the second time
something was not right with the connection (lack of throughout) which
prompted me to disconnect. If it happens again, I'll try different versions
of the above software.
