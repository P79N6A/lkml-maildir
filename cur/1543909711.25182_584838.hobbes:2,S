Perhaps.  But none of
	sysfs_remove_one()
	sysfs_remove_subdir()
	sysfs_remove_dir()
	sysfs_remove_file()
	sysfs_remove_file_from_group()
	sysfs_remove_group()
	sysfs_remove_link()
return a value.  Why should sysfs_remove_bin_file() be different?  And 
what callers would pay attention to the return value?
