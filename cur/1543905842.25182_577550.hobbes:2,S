yes, and as I've already replied, I have this patch ready.  however, I've got
some other work that I'm doing in one of the callsites, and since there are only
currently two sites, one of which already has some pending changesets in -mm,
I'm waiting for those to get some testing first. Once there are no
issues/requests with my current changesets, I'll be submitting a patch with the
cleanup of the callsites, along with some other changes.

Neil
