If you do that please also fix the X server to always use the /proc/bus/pci/* 
access methods too instead of banging on  0xcf8 directly. The current
method is racing with the kernel and can actually cause hard disk corruption
on x86-64 machines that use the IOMMU (IOMMU flush uses pci config space
access too)
