LABEL= is the wrong solution to the right problem, IMHO.  It only seems to 
make sense if you are a distributor trying to make a one size mostly fits 
all.  If you tinker with your system it only seems to get in the way.  
It seems to me that if you are in the position of tinkering, and 
installing an OS you ought to have an understanding of root and boot 
disks, and what is in your system.  If you don't understand things well 
enough to specify the proper boot disk and root disk you shouldn't be 
tinkering and it won't matter how each is specified.
