Subject: Patch for inconsistent recording of block device statistics
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/22/284

The read/write statistics for both sectors and merges are calculated at 
the time requests first enter the request queue but the remainder of the 
statistics, such as the number of read/writes are calculated at the time 
the I/O completes.  As a result, one cannot accurately determine the 
data rates read or written at the actual time the I/O is performed.  
This behavior is masked with smaller queue sizes but is very real and 
was very noticeable with earlier 2.6 kenels using the cfq scheduler 
which had a default queue size of 8192 where the time difference between 
these sets of counters could exceed 10 seconds for large file writes and 
small monitoring intervals such as 1 second.  In that environment, one 
would see extremely high bursts of I/O, sometimes exceeding 500 or even 
1000 MB/sec for the first second or two and then drop to 0 for a long 
time while the 'number of operations' counters accurately reflect what 
is really happening.
The attached patch fixes this problem by simply accumulating the 
read/write sector/merge data in temporary variables stored in the 
request queue entry, and when the I/O completes copies those values to 
the disk statistics block.
