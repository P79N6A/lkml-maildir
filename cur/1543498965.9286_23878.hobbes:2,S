Don't forget about the parallel port ATAPI drives.  There are a lot of
HP-7200e users out there who'd love to see a UDF implementation.  Once there's
a standard interface in the Uniform CD-ROM layer, and a reference SCSI
implementation, I'll add the support to 'pcd'.  
By the way, on a related topic, has there been any thought given
to moving the SCSI/ATAPI audio IOCTLs into the Uniform layer ?  There are
now at least three separate instances of almost the same block of code (in the
SCSI, IDE and parallel ATAPI CD-ROM drivers).
