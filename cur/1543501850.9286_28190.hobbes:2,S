Let me guess: you provided personal instruction.
Most of the computer science students I know use M$ Office.
I think I met a TeX user once... maybe. What planet are you from?
At least the CS students could mostly tell you what TeX is,
as long as you pronounce it like the "Tex" in "Texas".
You are trying to justify what we already have, because it is easy
to deal with a total lack of change. You are not interested in
solutions with sort-term pain for long-term gain.
The best solution is to avoid writing documentation and reports,
but I understand that not everyone has that luxury.
