Had the same problem with a shell machine I admin, once it hit around 200
processes everything would would start to get out of file handle and out of
processes messages and start to bring the machine down. I got around it with
adding the following to my rc.local:
/bin/echo 32768 > /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
/bin/echo 8192 > /proc/sys/kernel/file-max
This was on 2.0.35 and now 2.0.36. We go over 250 processes at times without
getting those errors again. This is on a Dual PII 350 with 512meg ram.
Anyone care to let me know what the max values these can be set at?
