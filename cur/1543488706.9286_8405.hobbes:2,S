This only goes to show how your "4 orders of magnitude" is ridiculous.
Saying that you suffer a loss of speed equal to 4 orders of magnitude is
like saying that because one's disk subsystem is 4 orders of magnitude
slower, this means that the whole environment runs that slow.  Sure it
does...*when you are doing disk I/O and waiting on the data*.  If you
can divide your data up and process in paralell, and have infrequent
lock communications over the network, then the 4 orders of magnitude
loss you suffer while doing those communications will not slow you down
anywheres near that much when looking at the overall picture.
Now if the whole system assumes that it's all running locally because
the programmer has been lulled into equating the abstraction layers with
reality, then your communications will take place inefficiently and
those 4 orders of magnitude will start rearing their ugly head.  Nobody
is arguing that.  One would always reduce inter-machine communications
as much as possible.
