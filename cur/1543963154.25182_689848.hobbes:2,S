 Thanks for appreciation.  You are right about the driver -- I have
explicitly asked for help to test it with the patch submission.  Actually
the only other user right now is a D-Link DNS-323 ARM-based system.  I
meant to cc the maintainer of the platform, but in the end I forgot.  
I'll do it now -- thanks for the point.
  Maciej
