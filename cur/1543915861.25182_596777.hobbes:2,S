Your proposed addition of flat_validate_relval is an API change, and 
very similar in nature to what I've done.
A local variable here is the most natural way to store this information. 
  What do you suggest we use, a global?  A member in the task struct?

I don't see how there's a burden given that we've provided patches, and 
most maintainers have already said their fine with it.  It seems to me 
that it's a natural and common thing for many architectures to be 
updated when new things are added to core code.
