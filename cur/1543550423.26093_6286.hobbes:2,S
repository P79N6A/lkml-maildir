*Ahem*
From Documentation/DocBook/kernel-hacking.tmpl:
  Wait Queues
  ...
    Queuing
    Placing yourself in the waitqueue is fairly complex, because you
    must put yourself in the queue before checking the condition.
    There is a macro to do this: wait_event_interruptible()
    include/linux/sched.h.  The first argument is the wait queue head,
    and the second is an expression which is evaluated; the macro
    returns 0 when this expression is true, or -ERESTARTSYS if a
    signal is received.
    The wait_event() version ignores signals.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
