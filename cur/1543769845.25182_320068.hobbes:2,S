No. Look, plist_for_each() is just list_for_each_entry() now.
So, the the first iteration will play with head->sp_node.next,
not with head! And then you are doing ->dp_node.next again in
plist_entry().
I'd suggest you to write simple programm, and test. I bet I'm
right.

15 or 0, I think it would work. Look, it is *new* priority, and
pl->prio < itr_pl->prio, so pl should stay just before itr_pl
in ->sp_node list. That is why list_add_tail(&pl->sp_node, itr_pl->sp_node)
is enough.
