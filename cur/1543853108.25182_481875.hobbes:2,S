Depends to the answer to my question elsewhere in this thread. If we
decide that the accelerometer class and drivers belong to hwmon, I'll
take the patch (well it'll need to be submitted and reviewed first
anyway.) But if we decide that they belong to the input subsystem, I'd
rather let Dmitry handle it.
