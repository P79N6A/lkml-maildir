Sure. It's cheap. If you don't mind slumming it, go and buy a 20 GB
IDE drive for US$65. I know RAM has gotten a lot cheaper lately (US$66
for a 512 MiB PC133 DIMM), but it's still far more expensive. If you
can afford 4 GiB of RAM, you can definately afford 8 GiB of swap.

That's not that common, though. Usually you get far more disc than RAM
on a laptop, just as with a desktop.
