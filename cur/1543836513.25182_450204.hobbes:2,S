the same thing does User BeanCounter patch.
The infrastructure is totally a separate question.
Moreover, as CKRM/UBC experience shows it is the most easiest code to agree on.
And as people agreed we need to speak about serious problems first,
not the interface one (at least, not at the moment when we have no working
resource controllers).

exactly. We have no workable controller.
So if there is no code we agreed on, whom is this infrastructure for?

I was familiar. And I can arise many arguable points in the CKRM infrastructure.
For example:
1. Should task-group be changeable after set/inherited once?
  Are you planning to recalculate resources on group change?
  e.g. shared memory or used kernel memory is hard to recalculate.
2. should task-group resource container manage all the resources as a whole?
  e.g. in OpenVZ tasks can belong to different CPU and UBC containers.
  It is more flexible and e.g. we used to put some vital kernel threads
  to a separate CPU group to decrease delays in service.
3. I also don't understand why normal binary interface like system call is not used.
   We have set_uid, sys_setrlimit and it works pretty good, does it?
4. do we want hierarchical grouping?

I hope so :)
Thanks,
