The question is if it is desired --- it will make bread return NULL on 
out-of-memory condition, callers will treat it like an IO error, skipping 
access to the affected block, causing damage on perfectly healthy 
filesystem.
I liked what linux-2.0 did in this case --- if the kernel was out of 
memory, getblk just took another buffer, wrote it if it was dirty and used 
it. Except for writeable loopback device (where writing one buffer 
generates more dirty buffers), it couldn't deadlock.
