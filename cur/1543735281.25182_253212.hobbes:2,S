Ah. Fair enough. I haven't seen any problems because the locking is more
abstract: processes are frozen when this runs for suspend. I'll fix it,
but won't bother resubmitting it because Pavel's changes should obsolete
this stuff.

Antonio posted it to LKML last week IIRC, which is why I didn't include
it in the device driver patches. Given Pavel's changes (again), I'm in
two minds as to whether its needed. It's clearly the right thing to do,
but not needed at the moment. Then again, as we noted already, the whole
device_class thing doesn't get a lot of use at the moment.
Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
