Right, except that you don't return EWOULDBLOCK, you return the
number of bytes transferred.  This is how sendfile() is currently
specified for nonblocking network fd's.
I've given up on this idea for now, and will live with the context 
switch overhead of having a worker thread issue the sendfile().  
I asked sct whether my worker thread scheme uses sigwaitinfo()
correctly; here's his reply.  Looks like some kind of nonblocking
disk read support may be coming in 2.5...
