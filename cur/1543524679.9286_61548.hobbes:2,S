Two things.  First of all, with e2compr, all you do is "chattr -r +c
<mount-point>" and everything on that filesystem is compressed by
default.  Isn't that what you are after?
Secondly, policy and mechanism are two entirely different things, and if
you want to implement a different policy for when to compress things
than the e2compr patch has, it makes little sense to go away and
reimplement the entire mechanism too at the same time!
