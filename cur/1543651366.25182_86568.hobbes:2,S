I agree 100% we mark too much as inline - but at the same time, some
larger functions are inline simply because they were originally part of
another function and pulled out for cleanliness.  They are only used
once...  in other words, in some cases I hope the kernel developers know
what they are doing when they mark stuff inline.
So I can see why bumping this limit very high is a good thing.  At the
same time, there is a lot of stuff incorrectly inlined and we should go
through and un-inline all of that, too.
