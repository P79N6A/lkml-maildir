David,
The job you did on ipv4 is quite excellent.  I multi-threaded the ODI layer
in NetWare,
and I have reviewed your work and it's as good as anything out there.  The
fewer locks,
the better.  Also, I agree that Sun's "hot air" regarding their SMP is just
that.  Sure, they
have a greart priority inheritenace model, but big f_cking deal.  sleep
locks and their behaviors
have little to do with I./O scaling on interrupt paths, other than to
increase the background
transaction activity on the memory bus.
Your ipv4 work is not perfect, but it's certainly good enough.  We found
with NetWare that SMP
scaling was tough to achieve since the processor was never the bottleneck --
the I/O bus was.
Uniprocessor NetWare 3.12 still runs circles around Linux or anything else,
and it's not
multithreaded, just well optimaized (and hand coded in assembler).
There are a few optimizations you could still to do to make it even faster,
but these are off line
discussions.  :-)
Jeff
