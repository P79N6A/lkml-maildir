I only want to force people to be aware of what they're doing.  So far I've
seen cache lines of up to 256 bytes in size on non-coherent systems.  Be
paranoid, very paranoid ...
Below patch should solve Dan William's concerns.  It will peform a writeback
and invalidation operation on the first and last cacheline worth of data.
The instruction costs around a dozen cycles so I won't even try to optimize
possible double cache operations away; that'd probably be more expensive.
