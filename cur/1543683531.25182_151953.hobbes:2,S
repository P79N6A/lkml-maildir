Subject: [PATCH] Remove what looks like a redundant ffb_options in ffb_drv.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/27/173

	Decided to try building stock 2.6.0-test2 on an Ultra 60 sitting here,
and ran into a redefinition of ffb_options between ffb_drv.c and
drm_drv.h. The one in ffb_drv.c looks redundant to me, and after
removing it I was able to successfully compile and boot the resulting
kernel.
