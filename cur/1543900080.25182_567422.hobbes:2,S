Please remind me what these things are. Suspend and hibernate work
fine here.

None of the VM makes real use of the SLAB counters. Nor will they ever
make real use of them because the counters are not usefully defined.
In other words, reclaimable is a lie. If SLAB claims there's 1M of
reclaimable memory, the actual amount may more often than not be zero
because we already tried to shrink the SLAB.
As I've said before, if you come up with a real use for these numbers,
I will sacrifice the appropriate number of puppies to support it in
SLOB. But I'd rather not crush any puppies here prematurely.
