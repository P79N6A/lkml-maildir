Right now I'm running Linux 2.4.9-ac4, compiled for SMP, with the
following loop (in bash):
while : ; do make dep ; make clean ; make -j3 modules bzImage ; done
It's been going for about 7 and a half hours without a lockup, so far.
Note that I am not using the on-board IDE -- but I did not need the
on-board IDE for my lockups either.
If 2.4.9-ac4 still produces lockups for people, it might be interesting
to try 2.2.19 or 2.2.20pre9, compiled for SMP, and see if the lockups
still happen then.
