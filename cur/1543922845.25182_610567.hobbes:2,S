Yes, and it should have a comment, because for now this is deliberate.
 This was primarily driven by the fact that MD has no way of
recovering from hardware errors during software-memcpy or
software-xor_blocks so there was no where to plug-in
accelerated-memcpy/xor error recovery.  I can foresee other clients
wanting to have this information reported but async_tx based clients
are supposed to be blissfully unaware of under the covers hardware
acceleration.
One idea is to pass an error-pointer as the parameter to callback
routines, but that would hamper the client's ability to recover the
context of the failure...
