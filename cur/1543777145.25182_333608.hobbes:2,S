Uhm. The loop seemed to be related to the Fedora zlib update,
 as both upgrading to 2.6.13-rc2-git5 without slab debugging
 and downgrading to 2.6.12-git5 still exposes the problem;
 this latter kernel didn't show this problem earlier.
Upgrading to bittorrent 4.1.2 from dag (previous was 4.1.1
 still from dag) seems to have fixed the looping issues.
Thanks,
