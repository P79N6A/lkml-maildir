This only make for a DoS attack if the there are user-writable
directories on a filesystem that the system depends on being writable.

If any SUID user writable directories (/tmp, /var/various, /home) are
kept on separate partitions from any SUID executables (belonging in
/bin and /usr/bin), creating such links becomes impossible, and the
problem vanishes.
If a SUID program is found to have a security hole, the administrator
should make sure he removes all links to it when deleting it, just to
be safe.
