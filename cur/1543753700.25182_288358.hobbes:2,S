I'd prefer to continue to export this flag if that isn't a burden.
The reason is that it is the only way we have to globally tell
the ACPI interpreter and all its (usually modularized) policy
drivers to allow or dis-allow support for platforms that openly
violate the ACPI spec.  (By default the flag is clear and is
set explicity with "acpi_strict")
While the ACPI modules in the tree at the moment don't use
this flag, there are other out-of-tree
modules on the way, and they may need it.
