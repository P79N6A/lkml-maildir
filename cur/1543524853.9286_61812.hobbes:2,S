I like the part of being able to poke kswapd via an interface
(wake_up_interruptible), this is something that might help numa
allocators ....
I hate the part of adding in more magic numbers to the balancing
logic, unless you can demonstrate how it helps. I know, 2.2
uses these magic numbers to set freepages.*, but I can't see a
logic to having min/max for zones. It is still probably acceptable 
to have the magic numbers in 2.3 for freepages.* setting (at 
least until we have a zone aware kswapd), for global stuff. If
you do decide to put in the min/max stuff, make sure to add
in the smarts to specify it from the command line (in 
setup_mem_frac).
The ZONE_BALANCED macro is currently a good way to see whether 
we really want to do more compute intensive classfree().
