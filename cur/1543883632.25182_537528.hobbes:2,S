Subject: CFQ IO scheduler patch series - AIM7 DBase results on a 16-way IA64

The results from a single run of an AIM7 DBase load on a 16-way ia64 box 
(64GB RAM + 144 FC disks) showed a slight regression (~0.5%) by adding 
in this patch. (Graph can be found at

   ) It is only a single 
set of runs, on a single platform, but it is something to keep an eye on 
as the regression showed itself across the complete run.
