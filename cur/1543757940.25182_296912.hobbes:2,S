At some point it makes sense to subdivide you mail load because 
serialization of i/o on that one filesystem becomes a bigger issue than 
the performance of your filesystem... We deliver into mbox formatted 
mailboxes inside users homedirs, some folks do a similar thing with 
maildir. In the end you can on make one filesystem so fast. beyond that 
you need more filesystems to acheive any kind of reasonable scaling...
