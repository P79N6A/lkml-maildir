Huh.  Intel firmware used to just not mention the VGA framebuffer
(0xa0000-0xc0000) at all in the EFI memory map.  I think that was
clearly a bug.  So maybe they fixed that by marking it WB (and
hopefully UC as well).
Tiger might support WB to the VGA framebuffer, but I don't think it
make much sense for us to use it that way.  If we did, writes to the
framebuffer would just sit in the cache until forced out by something
else.  Probably using WC would be the best, but we don't have a good
interface for that yet.
Tony, if you agree with this analysis and haven't fixed it yet, here's
a trivial patch.
[IA64] always map VGA framebuffer UC, even if it supports WB
EFI on some machines, e.g., Intel Tiger, reports that the VGA framebuffer
supports WB access.  ioremap() prefers WB when possible, so it can work
when mapping main memory.
But it doesn't make sense to map a framebuffer WB, because the driver
doesn't flush explicitly, so updates won't make it to the device
immediately.
This is due to Zou Nan hai <nanhai.zou@intel.com>.
