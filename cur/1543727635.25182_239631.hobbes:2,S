Indeed.  To a first order it doesn't matter if the default system
namespace is crappy -- applications inventing its own namespaces
(usually inconsistently) means that it's IMPOSSIBLE to make all
applications do the same thing - which is actually more important to
make them all do "the right thing."  Furthermore, it blocks
improvements such as udev.
Note there is nothing that says cdrecord -scanbus can't print out
a list, using the system device names.
