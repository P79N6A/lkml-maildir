This is intentional.  You can set the permissions to anything you want
by making tar honor the umask setting -- without needing to run chmod
after extracting.
So either use the --no-same-permissions option of GNU tar, or simply
don't run tar as root (then this option is on by default), which is a
good idea anyway.
