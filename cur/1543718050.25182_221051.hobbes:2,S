Well, this may be OT (I'm sorry, if so), but I ran pppd yesterday on 2.6.6-mm2 
with no major problems on an SMP box (AMD64).  The only problem I had with it 
is that the pppd died unexpectedly 6-7 minutes after the connection had been 
established, but this might happen for many reasons.  My kernel had been 
built without CONFIG_PREEMPT, though.
