After a second though I think this kind of justification is not 
appropriate :
	- If we play this game of counting the machines that works with your 
patch and the machines that breaks, we may end up removing this patch as 
I have seen other with other laptop model also failing while executing 
the _STA and _INI initialization...
	- Anyway, there are already 3 machines in the black list includings two 
very popular old dells...

Come on, APM is a thing from the past and any recent laptop does not 
even care of supporting it now that Windows XP is  bundled... And in any 
case it is not supported by this particular machine...

While I tried to read the ACPI specs for the fisrt time this morning 
searching for the meaning of _STA and _INI (and found the section 
related to INI rather unclear) I suspect the _INI is just dedicated to 
that purpose for escaping from legacy mode. But frankly, I got lost in 
the code trying to see when and how the function is really called... I 
would really like to have some help from ACPI development team on this 
one...
But if a BIOS function is called and the BIOS expects the APIC disabled, 
I would not blame BIOS writer if calling the function fails... So either 
the APIC should be disabled again or the ACPI initialisation should be 
done before turning the APIC on. But I have no idea about feasability...

My experienec 6 years ago writing a floppy network boot loader (in 32 
bit mode with a BIOS trampoline) is that this is not sufficient : before 
calling the BIOS, you should also restore the interrupt controller 
status in the legacy mode you got when entering (e.g 8259 programmation 
and especially PIC masks or any other legacy emultation). While this is 
not required on many machines, on some machines others, the bootloader 
just do not work without...
