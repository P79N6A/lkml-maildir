Hi Andrew,
[Sorry for sending these twice. My send mbox script failed miserably
 and this batch is sent by hand. Does anyone have one a script that
 works with quilt?]
Here's some pending slab cleanup patches from various people. Please note
that the patch "slab: distinguish between object and buffer size" is a
replacement for the objsize renaming patch you have sitting in -mm.
