You could at least allow changesets to be committed out-of-order if they
don't touch the same files _at_ _all_. Unless you're going to do a
complete compile-and-regression test after every commit, you have no
business being anal about change ordering either.
I don't claim this is _easy_, merely that it's a requirement for me to
be happy with the thing.
I also _really_ miss the ability to 'pull' while there are uncommitted
changes in the checked-out tree. Especially since actually having
_committed_ certain one-line compile fixes makes all my _real_ changes
depend on them, etc...
