If I understand him correctly, he is happy that ext2 has not as much
overhead as FAT32.
esp@pyroshells.com: If you think the FAT32 overhead is a linux problem,
please unpack the same source tree under windows on the same partition
and report back if the space used is less than when unpacking this
source tree under linux.
