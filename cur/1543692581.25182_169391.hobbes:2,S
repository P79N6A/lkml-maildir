The version strings are made from info obtained from vmlinux and the *.o
files.
So vmlinux is a prerequisite to calculate the version string.
And to get vmlinux you need to build the kernel.
And the build system will check all dependencies when it needs vmlinux.

Which require vmlinux and other module.o files.

I would like to know if there exists any cases where _more_ (or less)
is being build.
Mostly I consider it a bug in such case, but there are a few corner cases.
