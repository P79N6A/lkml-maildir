Hi all.
If you're using a 2.4 kernel and haven't tried software suspend, or
haven't tried it in a while, would you please consider giving it a try?
The patches can be found on sourceforge.net/projects/swsusp. You'll want
to download beta19 and then add the patches from the devel section
beta19-0[1-8]. All feedback is welcome on the swsusp list. You'll find a
link to it by going to the homepage from there.
This is the code I'm currently completing a port of to 2.5, so I'll
shortly (DV) be after testers for the 2.5 version too.
Regards,
Nigel
