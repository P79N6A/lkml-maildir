One last plea for the 2.4 scheme:
 a) all the crazy stuff goes in 2.6.x-preN, which ends up being
    equivalent to 2.6.<odd> and friends in your scheme
 b) bugfixes only in 2.6.x-rcN, which ends up being equivalent to
    2.6.<even>-* in your scheme.
 c) 2.6.x is always 2.6.x-rc<last> with just a version number change[1]
This has some nice features:
 - alternates as rapidly as you want between stable and development
 - no brown paper bag bugs sneaking in between -rc<last> and 2.6.x 
 - 2.6.* is suitable for all users, 2.6.*-rc* is suitable for almost
   all users
 - it's already in use for 2.4 and people are happy with it
I _really_ don't want to explain to people that they don't want to use
2.6.13 because it's an odd number but that 2.4.31 is just fine (and so
is 2.6.9). Nor do I want to teach my ketchup tool the difference
between 2.6-stable and 2.6-unstable.

I think naming the interim releases -pre/-rc has done this admirably
for 2.4.
