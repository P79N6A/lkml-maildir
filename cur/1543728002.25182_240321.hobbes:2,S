The submitted patch changing the default rounding mode
caused several regressions in the LSB suite, so it was
NOT the correct fix.
Greg made a finer-grained change which seems to have
made LSB happy.  Unfortunately, he's on vacation this
week, or I'd have him submit the patch he finally used.
I THINK he changed the rouding mode only for a single
corner case in the normalization macro, but that's
about all I remember...
