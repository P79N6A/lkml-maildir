Yah, I agree - this is safe and good.

Do we want to introduce this into 2.4 now?  I realize 2.4-ac is not 2.4
proper, but if there is a chance this interface could change...

Eh, why do this?  BUG_ON is the same effect and it is more readable to
me... seems better that 2.5 gets 2.4-ac's behavior instead of the other
way around.

I did not include this in my original O(1) backport update because
nothing in 2.4-ac seems to use it... so why include it?

Another case of 2.4-ac being right: the priority range is
1..MAX_USER_RT_PRIO-1 (i.e. 1 to 99, inclusive).

I think all three of these hunks look better in 2.4-ac... in all three
cases, the formatting seems better than in 2.5 IMO.
