This is because the whole user input handling was reworked in the mean
time.
For keyboards, things are like this:
  * A low-level port driver implements a serial endpoint. For PCs,
    this are the keyboard and aux channel of the keyboard controller
    i8240. These are called serio ports.
  * Protocol drivers can be hooked up to these serio ports and
    communicate with the actual hardware. This is eg. a driver for AT
    keyboards or a PS2 mouse.
  * All protocol drivers (eg. the atkbd driver) will *never* ever
    stuff the raw I/O anywhere. They interpret the stream and push
    commonly used values into Linux's Input API. That is, if you press
    the "A" button on *any* keyboard, all drivers will issue a KEY_A
    event and never ever tell about the specific raw keycodes
    received.
  * If you talk to the old /dev/psaux interface, of if you use the raw
    mode for keyboard reading, then the formerly issued KEY_A event is
    translated back to the raw sequence. Of course, non-recognized
    events (like two break codes) cannot be emulated, so this doesn't
    work at all.

There's no direct raw level anymore; it's the result of emulation
these days.
There are two solutions:
  * Throw away the atkbd driver. That means there's no more a
    "keyboard" from the system point of view. Write a small daemon
    that uses the serio_raw driver to get the raw I/O coming from the
    keyboard and make it interpret it. Don't forget to also do atkbd's
    work and parse the "normal" keyboard I/O, too, and issue the KEY_A
    (and all the other) events to the kernel using the uinput driver.
  * Write a filter driver for your keyboard. (Actually, write two.)
    I've done that some time ago, with some luck you'll find it. If
    not, that's probably lost (was just a test:-)
    Such a driver is both, a protocol driver and a serio driver. As a
    protocol driver, it accesses a serio port and relays the read data
    to a second driver (which should in your case parse the MSR data
    and relay it to some userland applications). Anything that's not
    specific to the POS functions (non-standard beeps, MSC, barcode
    scanner, background light, LCD display, ...) should be given back
    to the first driver, which (serio half) also registers a new serio
    port to be useable by atkbd.
I'm not sure what the best variant is. The first one is a bit easier
to implement, but if you fsck up your daemon, you no longer have a
keyboard:-)  The second one is a bit harder to implement, but you can
reuse the atkbd driver. As I said, that was already written once and
proved to work.
