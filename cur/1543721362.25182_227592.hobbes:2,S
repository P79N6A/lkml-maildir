Jeff Garzik intends to add a passthru ioctl to libata, specifically for
applications like smartmontools.  As soon as he's done this, we'll add
another '-d sata' device type to utilize that ioctl().

I don't know the answer but suspect that the scsi layer can handle this
'as is'.  In fact the 3ware support in smartmontools passes all commands
through the scsi layer.
I appreciate the offer to act as a tester -- you'll probably hear from me
when this work is in progress, to take you up on it.
Cheers,
