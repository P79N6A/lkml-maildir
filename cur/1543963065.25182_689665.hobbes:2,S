Certainly some cards will take blocks that haven't been changed very
much and exchange them for blocks that have been written more often
(this being physical blocks, not the virtual mapping shown to the
outside).  That way the wear gets spread around more even if some parts
of the flash are never changed (from the point of view of the outside).
The actual algorithm used is vendor specific.
