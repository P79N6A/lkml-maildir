I have almost the same behavior here except that eepro100 works
without freezes. Maybe spylog servers' NIC load is much more higher
than mine :)
Intel support guys advised me to test both versions of e100 driver.
ftp://aiedownload.intel.com/df-support/2896/eng/e100-2.1.15.tar.gz
ftp://aiedownload.intel.com/df-support/2896/eng/e100-1.8.38.tar.gz
Unfortunately, I haven't tested it yet. My investigation shows that
the following fragment of e100_main.c code fails:
<code from="e100_hw_init">
     if (!e100_wait_exec_cmplx(bdp, 0, SCB_RUC_LOAD_BASE))
            return false;
</code>
we returning false here.
And I am stalled for now till the end of next week until the ACM ICPC
Qfinal is over :(
