Interesting. My old testing must have been with an ffs image I guess.

2.5.25-dj1. I expect the same problem to exist in mainline if its
AFFS specific, as I currently have no patches in that area.
Unfortunatly I've not time right now to test mainline, as I've
more important things to do before I catch a flight.  If it's
still happening when I get back in a week or so, I'll try again.
