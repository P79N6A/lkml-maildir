But anyone who is going to free the structure which contains the
work_struct would need to run flush_workqueue() beforehand, after having
ensured that the work won't reschedule itself.  So the
struct-which-contains-the-work_struct is safe during the callback's
execution.
If that's not being done then the code was buggy in 2.6.19, too..
