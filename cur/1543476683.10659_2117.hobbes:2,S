I have not been paying to much attention to this thread so my apoligies if
I am misunderstandiing this. 
the origional proposal was to make ports that are not listened to return
nothing and log the attempt instead of returning a reset. As you mention
this is a firewall function. Can the ipchains do this or does this need to
ba added?
