For minimal versions of secure ?
    Since this memo was first issued (under a different title), the MD5
    algorithm has been found to be vulnerable to collision search attacks
    [Dobb], and is considered by some to be insufficiently strong for
    this type of application.
You'll also find that with SACK it doesn't fit in the tcp header..
