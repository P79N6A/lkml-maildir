Hi!
since at least 2.4.0-test5 (the oldest kernel I have around) floppy support
is broken on alpha.
If I e.g. do
od -c /dev/fd0 | more
I get all sorts of weird stuff (parts of libc, directory contents, other
binary data) but not the floppy's real contents. Mounting of floppies also
doesn't work.
The floppy drive and controller hardware is presumably ok since I currently
sucessfully boot MILO from it.
System is AXPpci33 'noname', onboard floppy controller
gcc version 2.96 20000925 (experimental)
Linux kernel 2.4.0-9-9 (problem exists since at least 2.4.0-5)
Does anbody else have this problem?
Where can I start hunting this down?
Bye,
Thorsten
