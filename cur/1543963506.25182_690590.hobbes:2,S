If you want to solve it that way, it's fine as well. My point is simply
that the asm-generic/topology.h definitions are effectively only sane on
the UP case in the first place. Out of the platforms that do CONFIG_NUMA,
both sh and mips are currently broken due to the cpu_to_node() bits.
sh tends to be the odd one out in doing both UP and SMP NUMA, so I don't
mind doing this in asm-sh/topology.h either. mips is almost certainly
broken, but the generic cpu_to_node() isn't going to be sufficient there
anyways, so "error discovery" there will at least wake up anyone
interested in the broken platform. ip27 seems to be the only effected
platform there, though it's not obvious if NUMA depends on SMP or not in
that case.
