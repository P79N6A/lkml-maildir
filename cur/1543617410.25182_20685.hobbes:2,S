The last time I did it for fs.h et al (this meant pulling the fs.h and 
sched.h codependancy apart), it got 2.4 compiles back down to 2.2 compile 
times (3m -> 2m45s maybe 2m30s iirc) -- about a 10% drop in compile time.  
It's even more noticeable when you're doing a fully blown modular kernel 
build as distributions do.
