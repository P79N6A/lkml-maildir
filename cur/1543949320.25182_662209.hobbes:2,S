Personally, I'd be OK with seeing "dummy" on my Altix on occasion. :-)
Perhaps "SELinux: Not registered, %s is reported" would address the
concern. It would be really good to see the value in the 99 44/100%
of the cases where it is available, even if it means admitting that
there are limited circumstances where you might know that someone
got there ahead of you, but not who it was. I don't think it's
worth going to heroic efforts to make sure it's available.
