If we have no threads this is not a problem. So can you explain to me
where the threads are in this example? I'm too dense to get your
telegraphy, have some pity.

POSIX says that SIGSTOP is unnmaskable because we are worried about
poorly behaved user programs. But instead of putting POSIX "thread
group" logic in the kernel, it seems simpler to have a trusted thread
daemon that does the work and let that daemon get raw signals.
Of course, you are violating POSIX, but only for a process that expects
to get non-POSIX semantics. Ordinary processes don't see this.
