   Overwriting syscall table entries is not safe. Its not safe because
   there is no locking mechanism, and its not safe because of the pentium
   III errata.
It is also non-portable, such syscall overwriting requires knowledge
of the layout of the table on every architecture.  On some platforms
it is a list of pointers + argument count, on some 64-bit platforms
it is a list of 32-bit truncated pointers to save space.
There is simply no portable way to make changes to the system call
table, so exporting it makes zero sense.
