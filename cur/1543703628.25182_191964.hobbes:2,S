Hmm. Looked at it. But it cannot help. All it does is move
cdrom_read_capacity().
But ide-cd remains fundamentally broken for disks.
It sends cdrom commands, and they fail, and it does not do
disk things that are needed. First of all, we need partitions,
but ide-cd.c puts g->minors = 1.
Don't know whether Jens really wants to bend ide-cd.c until
it also handles disks, but it smells like a hack.
