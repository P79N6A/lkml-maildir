That's because your problem requires a change to the
balancing between swap_out() and refill_inactive_scan()
in refill_inactive()...
The big problem here is that no matter which magic
proportion between the two functions we use, it'll always
be wrong for a large proportion of the people out there.
This means we need to have a good way to auto-tune this
thing. I'm thinking of letting swap_out() start out way
less active than refill_inactive_scan() with extra calls
to swapout being made from refill_inactive_scan when we
think it's needed...
(... I'm writing a patch right now ...)
regards,
Rik
