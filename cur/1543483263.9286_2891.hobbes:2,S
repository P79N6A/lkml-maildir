	This was driving me nuts (ok, ok - short putt) until I saw some
remark about using sndconfig.  I had tried different combinations of
esstype=????, irq=??, and dma=?? and had not gotten anything to work.  When
I ran sndconfig, it modified my /etc/conf.modules file with the following
sb line:
	options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=0 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x300
	That worked!  The only reak difference between that and all of the
options combinations that failed was the "dma=0" option!  Everything else
was the same as the combinations that failed.  Haven't had a single problem
since!
	Obviously, I have the sound system compiled as a module...  :-)

	Try running sndconfig and see what it has to say about your setup.
