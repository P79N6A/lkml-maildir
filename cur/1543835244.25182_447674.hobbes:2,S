in userland it works, no question about that.
The problem comes when you want to use this userland abi in kernel
space; for x86-64 it could be done by a 20 line gcc patch, on some other
architectures... it's going to be really incredibly hard.
I'd have loved to make this more generic... but the mechanism behind
this technology on the gcc side is very architecture specific.
