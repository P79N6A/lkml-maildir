are there cases where userspace wants to disable deadlock-detection for 
its own locks?
the deadlock detector in PREEMPT_RT is pretty much specialized for 
debugging (it does all sorts of weird locking tricks to get the first 
deadlock out, and to really report it on the console), but it ought to 
be possible to make it usable for userspace-controlled locks as well.
