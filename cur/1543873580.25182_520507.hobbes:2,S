Thanks Andrew for considering.
I eventually tried to add "pci=assign-busses" as it was suggested by
the initial console output but I still have some issues I think. For
example:
$ dmesg
[...]
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@d0000000 for 0000:01:00.0
[...]
I join the corresponding dmesg.
Hope that helps.
