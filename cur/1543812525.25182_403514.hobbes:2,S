2.4 never officially had cpufreq.

v2 is v1+voltage scaling. As the driver doesn't do voltage scaling,
there's no difference.

No. It's to do with the way frequency scaling is implemented on those CPUs.
It's very tempremental.  If there's any (for eg) IDE DMA that occurs
during a frequency transition, everything goes bang a short time later.
There's an ugly patch below that was submitted, which fixes it for
some people, but as it's a) ide specific, and b) completely the
wrong place to do this and c) racy,  I never merged it to mainline.
I'm hopeful that future generations of their CPUs will behave
in the same manner of other implementations that other x86 vendors
have invented, where we don't need such hacks.
 > Please, somebody fix this frequency scaling issue!
I'm actually contemplating marking it CONFIG_BROKEN in mainline,
as there's not a great deal we can do to make it work without
significant infrastructure to quiesce DMA.
