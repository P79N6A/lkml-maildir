Well this may be a little off topic.
But I would like to thank Kurt for supporting DC390 back in 1997 (or 
1996? I know it was before the France World Cup soccer games)
when I was contemplating of moving to Solaris or linux from OS/2.
Without his support to fix some problems (module usage, etc.),
I would not have moved to linux at all.
The DC390 is still working in my PC box to connect HP DAT2 tape drive
and CD/PD combo while faster SCSI disks are connected on other
boards.
Thank you again, Garloff-san !
PS: This trusty AMD chip board may be still alive in many
PC boxes around the world...
