Right, I thought of that, but how is it that it gets corrupt at exactly 
the same offset in task_struct of that process and every time with 
different processes? (I have run it atleast 20-30 times). And it just 
doesnt come if I kill the process in question? (I couldnt kill kupdate, 
and hence it comes anyways). And I have checked the task_struct of that 
process, the next_task & prev_task & other fields are not corrupted. 
Ofcource, it's still possible, like if the memory allocated & freed by 
my code is then used by scheduler for allocating task_struct; and then 
it is accessed again by mistake by my code at the same offset. 
But you feel sure it's a run queue corruption problem, and not anything 
else? If so, is there any particular way to debug this?

No, it does not:(
