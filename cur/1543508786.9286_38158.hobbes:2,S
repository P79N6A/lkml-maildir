Hi all,
I have heard about 16/32 bit OS. As far as i know a 32 bit Os means
that the instructions that are used to code OS knew only 32 bit
operations. Am i right !!!
Now if i have say a 32 bit Os and the length of my data bus of PC is
64 bit, can i not run a 64 bit program on my PC.
I mean if my compiler and CPU can undertand that instruction where
does the OS come in between to prevent it.
I think as far as i am not needing dynamic memory support from OS
i can run say a simple program which transfers 64 bits from
memory location to my 64 bit register.
Correct me if i am wrong in above logic
Thanks in advance
Sachin
