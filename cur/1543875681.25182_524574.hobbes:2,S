Perhaps. Folks I work with would disagree with that, but I am not  
enough of a storage expert to judge. My statement mirrors the  
judgement of folks I work with that know more than I do.

It theoretically could be, but we are using the latest Adaptec  
firmware. Until there exists firmware that fixes it, it remains an  
issue. We worked with Adaptec to isolate this issue, but no  
resolution has been forthcoming from them. I agree that this does not  
mean that NCQ should be disabled in libata core, but some combination  
of controller/drive/firmware blacklist may need to be managed, as  
distasteful as that is.

I didn't say that it is a majority or that it doesn't work, it just  
often doesn't perform. If it didn't work there would be lots of  
howling for sure. I'm also not saying that it is a libata problem. It  
seems mostly to be controller and drive firmware issues - and the odd  
fan issue (if you saw the thread: [BUG 2.6.21-rc3-git9] SATA NCQ  
failure with Samsum HD401LJ).
I guess I am mainly lamenting the current state of SATA/NCQ devices  
and sharing what little I have picked up about it - which is that I  
want SAS disks in my next system!
