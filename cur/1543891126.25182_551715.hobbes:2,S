Right.  Usually we cannot select them, as it's the wires between
the ATA chipset (motherboard) and the CFCARD that determine this.
So I suppose this means that most implementations are using the I/O access method,
except for some embedded systems where the CFCARD is wired to the host bus
without a separate "controller" chip in between.
