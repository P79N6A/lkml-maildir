find the correct patch below. I've tested it with an NMI watchdog
frequency artificially increased to 10 KHz, and i've instrumented the
new branch in the NMI handler, but even under heavy IRQ load i was not
able to trigger the branch. Maybe newer CPUs handle this case somehow
and make sti;hlt truly atomic? I tried this on an old Celeron
(Mendocino) and on an Athlon64.
