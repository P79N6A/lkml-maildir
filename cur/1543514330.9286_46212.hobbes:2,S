Subject: 2.3.23 random lockups, 2.3.9-2.3.22 won't boot

I had tried compiling the 2.3.x stuff to try out USB.  Somewhere
around 2.3.9, the kernel quit booting for me.  I'm sorry, I don't
remember what all configuration options I had selected.  My strategy
was to take the default on most everything, turn off what I obviously
didn't need, and modularize as much as I could.  After LILO, it would
say it was loading and uncompressing the kernel but never get any
further.  This was with a plain-jane redhat 6.0 system.  I tried
several later kernels with the same result.
I then resorted to reading the stuff in Documentation (go figure :)
).  So, now I have upgraded to:
insmod-2.3.6
egcs-2.91.66
GNU ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1.0.23)
/lib/libc-2.1.1.so
/usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib/libc.so.5.3.12
ldd (GNU libc) 2.1.1
/usr/lib/libg++.so.2.7.2.8
procps version 2.0.2
procinfo version 17 (1999-05-16)
psmisc version 18
net-tools 1.51
(GNU sh-utils) 1.16
Linux automount version 3.1.1
Kernel 2.3.23 compiles and installs fine.  It boots up and runs
appearantly OK.  After a while though it will hang.  I am almost
always in X at the time.  I don't have very much in my kernel (I was
trying to keep it simple so that I could get it to run).  My hardware
is:
SOYO 5EHM Super Socket 7 motherboard
128MB PC100 RAM
IDE with only one 3.2G disk
Matrox Mill g200 AGP video
3x59x ethernet
I have USB, but am not currently loading the modules.  I will try
2.3.24 as soon as I can d/l it.
