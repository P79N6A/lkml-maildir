Sure is, which is why I think it's easier to fork a BSD to make it do
what someone wants than to roll my own linux distribution :-).  
Perhaps that's a problem of perception and not a really good
measurement of the amount of energy involved in either alternative.
Sometimes it sure seems easier to keep the userspace stuff with the kernel.

I'm not sure what you mean by a joinable namespace.  I also am not
sure I want them :-).
I think of namespaces as being fundamental to the process model and
that they are inherited from the parent and new ones are created in a
sort of COW fashion [or at least have similar behavior].
You might want a session namespace instead of a joinable per-process
namespace but I think that might be a slightly different point of
view.
