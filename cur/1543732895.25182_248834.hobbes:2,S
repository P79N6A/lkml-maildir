Yea, but there are other uses than developing and debugging.  For example,  
handheld environments use the leds to display when new mail comes, could  
also turn on the led based on an entry in the calandar to notify the user  
that some event is coming up, etc.
It's not really intended for debugging, because you can't control the leds  
until after module_init/device_initcall.

Hey I agree!  I use the led as a debugging tool on the Sharp Zaurus.   
Before I had the framebuffer or the serial port working, being able to see  
the led told me something was working :)  This patch isn't really intended  
for debugging support, so perhaps some other interface could be added.
On the other hand, perhaps we can just do a #ifdef LEDS_DEBUGGING that  
would toggle the led on a timer.
