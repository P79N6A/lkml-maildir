Hello,
I thing that the bridging code is broken in 2.2.14pre12; it refused to work
after
upgrading from 2.2.13 to 2.2.14pre12. The only difference is ( from user
point
of view ) that BRCFG does not display any port stats...
ie.. 2.2.13
bridging is ENABLED     debugging is DISABLED
bridge id               0x0080 00:c0:6c:65:66:45
designated root         0x0080 00:c0:6c:65:66:45

bridge hello time       2       hello time              2
bridge forward delay    15      forward delay           15
root path cost          0       root port               0

designated port         0       flags                   TOPOLOGY_CHANGE_ACK

but 2.2.14pre12
bridging is ENABLED     debugging is DISABLED
bridge id               0x0080 00:c0:6c:65:66:45

If I remember correctly there was a change in net/bridge/br.c & friends in
some recent 2.2.14pre
release, maybe the ?bug? was introduced then ??
