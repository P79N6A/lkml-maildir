I have and it is very impressive. It looks much more manageable and more
flexible than LIDS. I have played with LIDS quite extensively but having
used both now I really prefer the concept of processes running in
different domains over just assigning capabilities. I'm still learning how
to configure SE Linux though. They are both rather daunting.
