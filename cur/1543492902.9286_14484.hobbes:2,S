[Sorry for me feeling "some people" = "Pavel Machek" ;-)]
Yes. I see usefull subsystem in kernel (capabilites etc.) which is
currently unused. I see very easy way to make that subsystem do
something usefull without need to change any parts of current
semantics. This is major point. I'm NOT CHANGING ANY SEMANTICS.
It may be that I'm implementing without thought...
...still what people keep showing me as counterexamples usually do not
work. 
Anyway, if you feel capabilities should be done some other way, GO
AHEAD AND CODE IT. There was much too much discussion, already.
