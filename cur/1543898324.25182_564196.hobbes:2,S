Hi all.
Suspend2's name is changing to "TuxOnIce".
This is for a couple of reasons:
In recent discussions on LKML, the point was made that the word "Suspend" is 
confusing. It is used to refer to both suspending to disk and suspending to 
ram. Life will be simpler if we more clearly differentiate the two.
The name Suspend2 came about a couple of years ago when we made the 2.0 
release and started self-hosting. If we ever get to a 3.0 release, the name 
could become even more confusing! (And there are already problems with people 
confusing the name with swsusp and talking about uswsusp as version 3!).
http://www.suspend2.net
 is still working at the moment, but we'll shift to 
http://www.tuxonice.net
 over the next while. The wiki and bugzilla are 
already done; email will remain on suspend2.net for a little while and git 
trees will be renamed at the time of the next stable release.
Regards,
Nigel
