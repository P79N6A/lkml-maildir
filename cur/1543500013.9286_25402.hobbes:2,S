The following message was mailed to the Network Flight Recorder Users 
mailing list as part of a debate on the performance of the Linux packet 
filtering implementation.  
Is anyone interested in getting $4000 for writing a good BPF implementation 
for Linux?
I think anyone in security should know who Marcus Ranum is, so take it from 
whence it comes.  I think he should know what he is talking about.

We have had Zero customers make Linux a requirement for 
purchase. Obviously someone could change that, by writing 
"I need Linux" on the back of a Purchase Order for, say, 
200 units, and Linux will get our undivided attention. ;)
Joking aside, we _have_ done a lot with Linux. For each 
version, when it's come out, we've tested its performance 
and found it inadequate. We've explained, in this forum 
and in others, gently and less gently, why Linux' packet 
capture code is mediocre. We've burned considerable man 
hours attempting to transfer clue to Linux religionists, 
and now, I see, to ""technology" journalist" Linux 
religionists. The main answer we get is "if you don't like 
Linux's packet capture, then _FIX_ it."
We don't like it.
Why don't _YOU_ fix it?
C'mon, seriously - one of you Linux heads out there 
could write the bitchenest zero-copy packet capture 
code on the planet. We'll buy you a beer. Hell, we'll 
buy you a case. How about it? We're busy writing studly 
traffic analysis engines. We're busy making them work
at speeds close to 100mb/s on reasonable hardware running 
reasonable operating systems. We're _BUSY_, get it? Fixing 
Linux is not our job, making the best ID software on the 
market is our job.
Tell you what, smarty-pants. I'll give you $4,000 and a 
cool NFR T-shirt if you write a zero copy-per-packet
input bpf emulation for Linux. Ok? I'll do one better than 
you can do: I'll put my money where my mouth is.

Gosh, I'm just a non-technical CEO type who's never done 
any network administration. So I appreciate your educating 
me. Certainly I've never done enough technical work to get 
to the point of realizing that _REAL_ network admins
don't have time to get religion about technology. The 
only technology you can afford to get religious about is 
that it _WORKS_.

Yeah. I'm sure they complain bitterly to Cisco that 
their routers don't run Linux, too.

Oddly, customers are willing to _PAY_ for NT products. That 
means that we get to stay in business and keep doing what 
we do well: building butt-kicking ID systems. I guess we 
could spend all our time fixing freeware, but then we'd
be out of business, now, wouldn't we?

Yeah, I read Wired, too.

I work within lots of limits. The fact that there aren't 
enough hours in the day for my team to do all the stuff 
we're trying to do is one of them.
I find it ironic that someone preaching Linux ideology at me 
would say "don't use it - use something else" is a bogus way 
of handling something inadequate. _THAT_ is the reason many 
Linux users give for not using Windows.
We haven't got anything against Linux* -- it's a good operating 
system. It just doesn't do well the one thing we need an operating 
system to do well. So we ask people not to use it. Seems simple, 
no? No, it's not simple. Things are never so simple when 
technology and fanaticism mix.
