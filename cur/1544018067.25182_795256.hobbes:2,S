But not in the kernel for sure.
I just checked and for example: OSS_init is not used anywhere in the kernel.
The kernel headers are not a "dump all your stuff" ground anymore.
So I encourage you to find a better home for the user space library definitons.
We can let the definiton stay for a while - but eventually they have to
be dropped from the kernel.
