Hi Richard,
That's because you ran it on a 2.5/2.6 kernel, right?  The test code is
meant for 2.4 kernels and earlier :)
Here is a more universal test:
	int main () {
		asm ("movl %%esp,%%ebp;sysenter" : : "a" (1), "b" (0));
		return 0;
	}
I expect it to do the first of these which is applicable:
	- raise SIGILL on Pentium and earlier Intel CPUs
	- raise SIGILL on non-Intel CPUs which don't have the SEP
capability
	- raise SIGSEGV on Pentium Pro CPUs
	- raise SIGSEGV on Pentium II CPUs with model == 3 and stepping
< 3
	- raise SIGSEGV on 2.4 kernels
	- exit with status 0 on 2.6 kernels
Enjoy,
-- Jamie
