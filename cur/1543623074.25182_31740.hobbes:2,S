Ok, I did that. Now I'm getting an error there's not enough swap space 
(logical enough I think).
/critical section: Counting pages to copy[nosave] (pages needed
:18062+152=18574 free 14689)
Couldn't get enough free pages, on 3885 pages short.
Kernel panic: Not enough free pages
If both swap partitions is disallowed, and one swap partition isn't enough 
space, is there anything I can do now to make this work? I'd really like to 
get suspend working.
I know at one point 128MB was the limit on a swap partition. Is this limit 
gone now?
How technically difficult is it to make swsusp work with multiple swap 
partitions?
Cheers,
Shaun
