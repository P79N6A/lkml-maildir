This is basically how uswsusp is designed. (We do not use system call,
you just read from /dev/snapshot, and you have to make few ioctls to
stop the other tasks).

Which is what I did long time ago, during uswsusp development.

Well... We decided not to do this in the fully working system. SIGSTOP
is just not strong enough, and we want the snapshot atomic.
Now, it would be _very_ nice to be able to snapshot system and
continue running, but I just don't see how to do it without extensive
filesystem support.
