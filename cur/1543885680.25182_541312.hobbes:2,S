Probably I don't feel those barriers enough, but IMHO,
there is something wrong, if they are needed here, with
all this made per cpu.

I think there are possible many curious, but correct things yet,
e.g. handler, which fires timer or another work, which rearms
this work... But maybe it would be resonable to try to separate
new things which are really necessary, so IMHO, (practical)
elimination of endless or excessive looping. If there is needed
some more functionality, maybe there should be second version
added e.g. cancel_rearming_delayed_work_sync(). Without this
you risk, people would really think the old version was better,
if you knew what you were doing. And the worst thing possible:
they'll start to use their own, lighter solutions.
I think, there is no reason, such function should need more
than one loop of one cpu workqueue to cancel any "normal" work
(or maybe two - if locking is spared), and it's really hard
to understand, why anybody should  wait all those "not mine",
so probably slow and buggy works in a queue, do their part of
needless locking/sleeping/looping and let "my" excellent
driver to be reloaded... And I think you are doing this now
with some reserves (kind of "with one hand") - because the
_PENDING flag is overloaded here and one flag still free.
I really cannot see how sparing one, two or even three flag
checks during a loop could be worth even one run_workqueue
loop more without them.
Yesterday I've written something probably against my intention:
so, if there is any CPU burning place, which could be fixed,
it's definitely worth fixing. I'm not sure what exactly place
did you mean - if spinlocking in wait_on_work - maybe it's
a sign this place isn't optimal too: it seems to me, this all
inserting/waiting for completion could be done under existing
locks e.g. in run_workqueue (maybe with some flag?).
