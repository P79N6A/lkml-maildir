I recently upgraded from 2.3.41 to 2.3.50 on my Dell Inspiron
3500 with a Linksys EtherFast 10/100 PC Card, at which time I
started getting the following kernel log messages when the
computer is woken from sleep.  This is with no net traffic,
typically with no cable plugged in.  I'd debug it myself, but
it may take a while to get to the top of the runqueue and be
scheduled.
