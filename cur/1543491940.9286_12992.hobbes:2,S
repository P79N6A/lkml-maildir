One way to fix it is to use Eric Youngdale's scsidev utility from
tsx-11.mit.edu. It scans the SCSI bus and generates a /dev/scsi
directory with SYSV style devicenames, containing LUN, ID etc.
Then you can use that directly in /etc/fstab.  
It may need some minor massaging though to compile and run on a 
2.2 kernel.
