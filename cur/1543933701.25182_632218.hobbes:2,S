A tricky question to answer.
On ARM based Zaurus handhelds the kernel has to fit into a 1.2MB
partition. It makes sense to have as much core functionality compiled
into the kernel as possible but its becoming increasingly difficult to
fit functional kernels into the space available. The devices only have
32MB or 64MB of RAM so a small kernel runtime is also a priority.
I wanted to compare a 2.6.17 build with 2.6.23 but comparing kernels is
surprisingly difficult. scripts/bloat-o-meter tells me about the
differences in function size but lots of functions were renamed and
between .17 and .23 the results are nearly meaningless.
The information below is a summary of the quick hacks I used to find out
where the size change (bloat?) was coming from. I'm mentioning it here
since some of the results are interesting and I'm also hoping someone
with more time might be able to improve the script and/or this way of
analysing the kernel...
To look at my specific problem I hacked "bloat-by-subsys" together
(included below). It only cares about the things built into the kernel,
specifically by looking at the "built-in.o" files as I wanted to look at
the "core". It assumes the tree layout didn't change too much between
the two kernel versions (directories move a lot less frequently than
function names change) and that directories make good units for
comparison.
The output from two kernel trees for the poodle machine I happened to
have handy was:

Some information is repeated here as a high level built-in.o contains
the built-in files from the directories below it. I think this
simplistic approach provides a good overview of the status though. 
The single most shocking figure is that for ./kernel which showed a 60%
increase in size:
./kernel/built-in.o                       203261  326552 +123291
./kernel/time/built-in.o                       -   67028  +67028
./kernel/irq/built-in.o                        -   23668  +23668
./kernel/power/built-in.o                   3048    3632    +584
I've not looked into it yet but it makes me wonder what I gained for the
123kb of RAM usage and the increased kernel size... (yes, from the above
I can make some guesses)
The results also highlight other issues, I've given interpretations of
some of the changes below:
function                                     old     new   delta
./drivers/video/logo/built-in.o             4104   38002  +33898
A logo was added into the 2.6.23 defconfig, this highlights the space it
takes up...
./drivers/hid/built-in.o                       -   24970  +24970
This shouldn't be being built in, a defconfig error
./drivers/cpufreq/built-in.o                   -   21910  +21910
2.6.17 didn't have cpufreq support
./arch/arm/mach-pxa/built-in.o             12336   24284  +11948
Probably from the pxa updates to support multiple cpus and the pxa3xx
series in one kernel - it comes at a price.
./lib/lzo/built-in.o                           -    2880   +2880
LZO wasn't present in 2.6.17
./drivers/input/built-in.o                 17008   21132   +4124
./drivers/input/touchscreen/built-in.o         0    2104   +2104
I disabled the touchscreen in 2.6.17 due to build issues so this is
partly bogus. This was the only change I made to the code.
./arch/arm/nwfpe/built-in.o                23697   23737     +40
Probably the NWFPE preempt fixes.
./drivers/video/backlight/built-in.o        3016    2900    -116
Probably the backlight cleanup.
./lib/zlib_deflate/built-in.o              17536   17412    -124
./lib/zlib_inflate/built-in.o              11452    8920   -2532
The zlib update had the side effect of space savings!
./fs/ext2/built-in.o                       27692   27260    -432
I didn't expect that...
./net/xfrm/built-in.o                      45808   35132  -10676
./net increased overall in size though counteracting this quite a bit...
./init/built-in.o                          19803    9412  -10391
./arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o               45613   30028  -15585
Some good looking code size changes here at least at first glance.
So some of the changes were due to extra features, one was an accidental
defconfig misconfiguration. There were surprise space savings and some
worrying size increases.
The script itself, keep in mind this is an extremely quick hack and it
could be a ton more efficient. Certain code was left in case I wanted to
go back to looking at things at a function level too:
