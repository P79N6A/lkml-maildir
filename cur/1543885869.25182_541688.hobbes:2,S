Um, the maintainer replied yesterday morning[1] that libertas-2.6.git 
has already been updated for these requests, will be updated some more, 
and overall was responsive to the entire list of Christoph requests.
I'm mainly concerned with removing the unnecessary ioctls before 2.6.22 
release, since that affects userspace.  The vast majority of other stuff 
is cosmetic, which is being worked on, but lower priority in my book.
