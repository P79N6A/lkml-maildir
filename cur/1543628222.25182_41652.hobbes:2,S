This doesn't work -- there is no BK _push_ to Linus.  There is no "sent
to BK for approval."
Traditional RFC822 email is sent to Linus, telling him that there are BK
changesets to be picked up.  A human-defined length of time ensues,
after which Linus either ignores or comments on the email, and either
does a 'bk pull' or not.
Very similar to the way GNU patches are handled, strangely enough ;-)
