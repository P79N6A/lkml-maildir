It would delay the processing of the softirqs for a full tick or more.
Note that changing to sub_preempt_count(HARDIRQ_OFFSET) is not enough,
you would then need to add a preempt_disable() right afterwards, which
would just be an extra subtraction that is avoided in the current
implementation.
But the big thing is that the softirqs should be handled as soon as they
can be.
