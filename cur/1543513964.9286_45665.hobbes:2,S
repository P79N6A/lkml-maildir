Oops, I remember something about ownership of symlinks. A symlink in /tmp
owned by root should never be unlinkable. Now we all know that the mode
of a symlink is meaningless so its owner must be meaningful in order to
create a difference in /tmp.
As far as I can recall many UNIXes deviate with respect to being able
to unlink files not owned by the euid in a 01777 directory like /tmp
The same UNIXes fail to restore the ownership of symlinks. For example,
on OSF/1 4.x "tar x.." doesn't lchown() symlinks to the original owner
when invoked as root. At the other side, the meaningless effect umask(2)
sometimes has on these symlinks is confusing as well (OSF/1 and linux
do the right thing though).
This dark corner in commercial UNIXes needs to be cleaned up but that's
not our task :-)
