I checked that, but I didn't think any of them were worth fixing. And
since this is a work in progress and a in a state which I do not want
committed yet, I did not sign this patch. mmio-mod.c is still a mess.

I believe the 'volatile' belongs here, it is also in the declaration of
iounmap() in arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c.

These are all in testmmiotrace.c which calls the traced ioremap
functions directly. These direct calls will go away and it will
call the normal ioremap functions.

Since testmmiotrace does not use v for anything other than return value
of ioread8/16/32(), I wanted to prevent the compiler from optimizing
it away. Now thinking it again, ioread*() must guarantee that the read
is always executed. I'll remove v altogether.
Patch for the other issues you mentioned is brewing.
Thanks.
