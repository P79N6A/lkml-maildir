Which is another argument, and bragging rights, to integrate something
like Reiser FS4. :)

They're trying to push their low level storage model into the kernel
after they saw how slow their userspace version of that is. It makes
sense to have this kind of stuff directly apart of a lower level FS
later

I tried to stay out of this thread, but I couldn't resist after this
post. :) MS has other problems, namely, they're a large company trying
to basically replicated Apple's (NeXT) OS X stuff, but onl 10x larger
and slower than it is. It's really silly what's going on with MS
development as well as the greater open source X community. The sooner
folks realize that all rendering models are moving in the direction of
Apple's OS X, the sooner they can just flat out rip it off.
It's going to require both kernel and userspace changes for this to
happen.
