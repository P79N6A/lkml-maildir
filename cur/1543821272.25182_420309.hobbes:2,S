I generally hate interfaces that have some "random base".
So "delay in seconds" is not a random base, because "seconds" is a good SI 
base unit, and there's not a lot of question about it. But once you start 
talking milliseconds on microseconds, I'd actually much rather have a 
"fake floating point number" over having different files have different 
(magic) base constants. How do you remember which are milliseconds, which 
are microseconds, and which are just seconds?
It should be easy to have a helper function or two that takes a "struct 
timeval" and reads/writes a "float".
