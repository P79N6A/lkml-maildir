Well, I'm actually looking at the 2nd idea I mentioned in my e-mail -- a very 
small "kernel package" which has a config script, a list of config options and
the files they depend on and an appropriately tagged CVS tree which can then be
used for a compressed checkout of a version to do a build.  (Or maybe something
more bandwidth-friendly than CVS for the initial checkout.)
Maybe I'll find the spare time to do it, maybe I won't, either way I won't post
any more on the subject until I have something tangible (so far I've just 
done the 'easy bit': written a quick shell script which imported 2.4.x into a
tagged CVS tree; the 'hard bit', to write a script to analyse each kernel rev
and determine which files are used by which config options and mix that in
together with the minimal install for a 'make menuconfig' will take somewhat
longer).
David.
