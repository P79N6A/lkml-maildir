Quoting David Howells (dhowells@redhat.com):
> Create a dynamically sized pool of threads for doing very slow work items, such
> as invoking mkdir() or rmdir() - things that may take a long time and may
> sleep, holding mutexes/semaphores and hogging a thread, and are thus unsuitable
> for workqueues.
> 
> The number of threads is always at least a settable minimum, but more are
> started when there's more work to do, up to a limit.  Because of the nature of
> the load, it's not suitable for a 1-thread-per-CPU type pool.  A system with
> one CPU may well want several threads.
> 
> This is used by FS-Cache to do slow caching operations in the background, such
> as looking up, creating or deleting cache objects.
