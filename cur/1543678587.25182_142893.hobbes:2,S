May I suggest whacking an icon up with "Donate to ReiserFS" up there?
Samba and GNOME are two projects which do this and at least get a bit
of funding for it. Check out the samba one, tridge says it does okay
with the updating list of who's donated money - makes it into a bit
of a fun game for donators :)
You've probably already got the credit card processing infrastructure
around, so it could be minimal effort - with only possible gain.
I'm sure happy reiser users would be willing to chuck a couple of
bucks your way to ensure further development.
