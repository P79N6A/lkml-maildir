Using the method suggested by Ingo and refined by Andrea I was finally
able to fix the free_inodes bug.  Tested successfully overnight with
Benno's rtc_latency tests.  I also tried the fixes on the pure 2.2.14
release but it still crashes.  For now, 2.2.14aa7 is the way to go.
I will test more over the weekend and submit the fixes to Ingo
early next week for review/release.
