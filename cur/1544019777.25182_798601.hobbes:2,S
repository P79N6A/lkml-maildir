Well, I've continued with my approach.  28 patches are currently merged
onto a follow-on branch (scattered throughout the series but in order)
and the result builds for my OMAP1, OMAP2 and OMAP3 test builds.
Patches which I've provided non-trivial comments on by and large haven't
been merged.  Once I've worked through the set, I'll provide a final list
of those outstanding so nothing should be lost.
I would appreciate someone _bouncing_ (not forwarding) the patches I'm
missing to linux@arm.linux.org.uk please.  Those being D6, E2 and F2.
