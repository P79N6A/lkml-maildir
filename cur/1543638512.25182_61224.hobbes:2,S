Preempt is irrelevant here.  To make any difference, there would have
to be an interrupt in the window between reading and updating
p->user->processes _and_ another process would have to be waiting to
enter fork().  Even if that occurred, the result is the user is one
process over their limit, big deal.

The result is just a slightly elevated process count in rare cases.
Even then it is self correcting.  It is not a significant race, just a
bit of fuzzy counting.

nr_threads is protected by tasklist_lock.  How on earth can fuzzy
counting on user->processes corrupt nr_threads?
