Actually, that is not quite true.  Local_save_flags / 
raw_local_irq_restore today is used only for operating on IF flag, and 
raw_local_restore_flags does not exist.  Our implementation of these in 
VMI assumes that only the IF flag is being changed, and this is the 
default assumption under which Xen runs as well.  Using local_restore to 
switch IOPL as well causes the extremely performance critical common 
case of pure IRQ restore to do potentially a lot more work in a hypervisor.
So if you do want us to go with the C approach, I would propose using 
raw_local_iopl_restore, which can make a different hypercall (actually, 
in our case, this is not even a hypercall, merely a VMI call).
