I don't get what you mean? I tested this, if I do "modprobe opl3sa2 
dma=1 dma2=3" it will activate
the card with dma 1,3 (according to /proc/isapnp). However, my card will 
not work with these values.

The idea is that I first try to activate the card without assigning 
fixed values to dma. If this works, then fine. If not,
use whatever the user wants for dma respectively take 0,1 as default 
value. If I do not choose default values, then it
will not work automatically unless the user specifies dma. But if the 
user has to specify values, this is not PnP
IMHO.
 From your previous message I figured that my patch is fine with you?
