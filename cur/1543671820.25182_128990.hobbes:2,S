Out of all the register_ioctl32_conversion functions that were
consolidated with this patch, only s390 and x86_64 did not already use
this same convention. linux/ioctl32.h already documents (and has always
been that way) this feature.
Maybe you feel better about this patch instead? Moved the logic directly
to compat_sys_ioctl. Also note that sys_ioctl is prototyped in
include/linux/ioctl32.h.
