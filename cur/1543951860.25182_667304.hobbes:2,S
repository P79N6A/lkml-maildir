I like the idea and it seems basically sound, but unfortunately Xen 
won't be able to make use of it in the near term, because it doesn't 
support any kind of backing for guest domain memory.  There has been 
some thought about adding this kind of functionality to Xen.  Keir, Ian: 
do you think this kind of support in the kernel be useful to us?
One concern I have is that 4k is really a very fine grain.  We're 
thinking about moving Xen's memory management to operate in 2M chunk 
units, which would allow guests to directly use large pages with the 
corresponding reduction in TLB pressure.  One side-effect of this is 
that we'd need to change ballooning to be in 2M rather than 4k units in 
order to prevent physical memory fragmentation.
Page hinting at 4k resolution poses the same problem.  Would this 
technique still be useful operating on 2M chunks?  Certainly it seems 
less likely that you could easily get a whole 2M area with the same 
fine-grained properties that these patches track.  Would some kind of 
page/sub-page tracking be useful?
My other concern is just correctness over time on the Linux side.  We 
already have enough trouble keeping things like the pte and page 
structure state in sync, with resulting rare data-loss bugs.  Adding 
another layer which only applies in specific environments raises the 
possibility for new bugs to be un-noticed for a long time.  How can we 
structure the VM changes to make sure that its robust in the face of 
maintenance?
