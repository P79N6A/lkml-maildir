Hi,
I compiled user-mode-linux kernel on Ultrasparc with load address set to
00000000e0000000. But, when I try to debug the kernel, it just says
cannot access memory at address 0xa00020b0.
This error message remains the same no matter what I change the load
address to. Can anyone guide me on valid memory addresses for userspace
on Sparc? and how much different is that from x86 architecture?
