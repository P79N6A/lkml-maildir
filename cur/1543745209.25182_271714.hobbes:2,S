The reason they might be useful under uClinux is that access_process_vm()
mucks around with pages in the middle of a high-order allocation.
Technically, with what was integrated to support uClinux and with the patch I
added, it's not actually necessary to use compound pages, I think, if only
because access_process_vm() provides some protections against munmap() and
exit().
However, that doesn't mean there isn't something I and the uClinux community
haven't noticed, or that situations won't arise in the future where the
current scheme is going to cause the kernel to explode.

No, it's not. In put_page() it's _always_ going to be at least one more
pointer chase, and sometimes it's going to be two more; though the dcache may
offset this. put_page() refers not only to data in the first real page of a
compound page, but the second real page too.
Furthermore, put_page() becomes out of line. This means you've got register
clobberage and the mechanisms of function calls to deal with. Also you've got
more conditional instructions. I would propose also that the condition
checking for PG_compound be marked unlikely().

I don't. However, the people hassling me about it might (hch for one).
