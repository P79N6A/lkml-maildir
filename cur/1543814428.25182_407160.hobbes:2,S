Yes, that sounds about right.  Some of the allocations in question are
order-1, and some are higher.

Will do, thanks.  Will the allocator give me a compound page if I ask
for a single page but pass __GFP_COMP, or do I need to be sure I always
make a higher-order request if I pass that flag?

Heh.  Actually, in this case, I really don't want the vma to get shared
with a child.  If the child gets a SEGV after a fork, that's intended
behaviour, as far as I'm concerned.

That's a useful aside, thanks.  It sounds like I want to set VM_DONTCOPY
on the pages I'm doing get_user_pages on too, then.

Is that the case for kernels prior to 2.6.15, too?
The problem is that I need to keep a version of the driver working on
kernels back as far as 2.6.9, in addition to the current mainline.  If
VM_SHM meant nothing back then, too, I can remove it entirely, otherwise
I should drop it only in the for-mainline driver, and leave the backport
version as it stands.

Yes, I actually dropped both of these last night.

Well, uverbs_mem.c only touches locked_vm for pages it's pinned using
get_free_pages.  We do much the same thing in that case.
I'll try turning off VM_LOCKED for the pages we allocate, and see what
breaks :-)
