I ran into the same kind of thing the first time I tried to rebuild the
kernel.  It seems to me that part of the problem is that it is WAY to easy
(especially for the newbie) to miss the warning about backing up the modules
directory.  It seems to me that the solution is to have the version number
changed on each build (i.e.: 2.2.5-15-build1) so that module collisions
don't occur.  This might introduce problems with software that check kernel
version--I don't know the API.  If this is okay, though, instructions in the
documentation about how to do such a thing would be much appreciated.  A
Great Big Button (tm) on make config would be even more appreciated.
