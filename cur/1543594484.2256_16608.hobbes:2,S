Seeing as 256:256 seems to be doing fine on my other two machines, yes, it
might.  But since I'd repartition too (I hate swapfiles) I'd like to do it
once and be done with it.  I'd also like to know what exactly causes the
original problem (Like I said, my workload hasn't changed nor my programs
that much.  And w/ twice my swap I get the same swap usage I used to get
in 2.2/late 2.3..)
