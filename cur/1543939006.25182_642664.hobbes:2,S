No, that's not the problem.  The code should just be using
usb_register_driver() and then doing what it needs to do in the probe()
callback, like any other USB driver.
By calling usb_find_device() it allows more than one driver to talk to
the device at the same time, setting it up for some very bad things to
possibly happen to the device.
So a simple code change should be all that is needed to properly fix
this.
If you want, I can make up a patch, just point me at the version you
wish me to modify.
