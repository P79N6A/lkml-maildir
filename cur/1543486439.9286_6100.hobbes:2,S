I've been seeing lots of these:
Feb 16 10:28:07 fuslwa kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 198789 busy, i_count=2, i_nlink=1
Feb 16 10:28:07 fuslwa kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found eps99/SCRATCH.GRD, d_count=0, hashed=1
Feb 16 10:28:07 fuslwa kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: eps99/SCRATCH.GRD: ino=198789, count=2, nlink=1
Should I worry?
Also some of these:
Feb  8 13:21:06 fuslwa kernel: nfs_revalidate_inode: akers/Oprec.ps getattr failed, ino=162247, error=-116
Feb  8 13:21:06 fuslwa kernel: NFS: bad fh 02001a000300000002000a002e2dc7790000a2a900000a000000020000000100
Feb  8 13:21:06 fuslwa kernel: NFS: lookup failed, error=-2
The machine is running 2.1.131ac13 (more or less ;-).  I've referred
to these as warnings, but maybe they are more serious than that?

(ps: yeah, I'm upgrading to 2.2 rsn)
