currently i only have tested them with a RAID array. That's the main usage 
of I2O controllers i think. But a tape drive would be important too in my 
opinion. If you have some other devices (e. g. scanners) which does or 
doesn't work it would be nice, if you could give me some feedback, so i 
could fix it (hopefully).
Best regards,
