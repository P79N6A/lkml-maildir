As a matter of fact I've been thinking, about one more Re: to myself
to point this all is a good example how problematic such solution
would be, but I've decided it's rather apparent. IMHO learning needs
bad examples too - to better understand why they should be avoided.
On the other hand, I've seen quite a lot of fundamentally right, but
practically broken code, so I'm not sure what's better. And, btw., I
guess this 'fundamentally broken' type of locking could be found in
the kernel too, but I'd prefer not too look after this now.
Thanks,
