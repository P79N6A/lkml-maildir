 Got this strange error in a machine Running RedHat Linux after upgrade from
5.2 to 6.0. Have tried both kernel 2.2.5 and 2.2.10 with the same. The user
seems to access his files without any trouble. The filesystem is exported
via NFS:

acc=1, error=13 
 Please respond me directly because I'm not on this list. Thanks a lot.
