At least on x86-64/i386 the ioremap is actually cached unless a MTRR
changes it, but it normally doesn't here. If one wants to force uncached
access one has to use ioremap_uncached(). You're saying IA64 ioremap
forces uncached access? That seems weird.

I would expect your ioremap to already do such a lookup. That is at least
how MTRRs on i386/x86-64 work.  If it does not how about you fix
ioremap()? Or provide a suitable ia64 dmi_ioremap, but it's likely
better to do it generally.
Regarding physical vs virtual efi.smbios -- it sounds nasty to have such
a difference in the EFI support for different architectures. Matthew, do
you have a suggestion how this can be unified?
