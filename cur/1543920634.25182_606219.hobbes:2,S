Hi,
hm, I guess this is probably due to pie-randomization patch, right? (could 
you please try reverting it, to see whether things get back to normal).
Oh well, this causes more trouble that I have ever imagined ... I will 
look into it, thanks a lot for the report. Andrew, please drop this one 
again, I will fix it up.
Thanks,
