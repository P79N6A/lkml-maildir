Actually I'd probably send you a patch for any bug I found that
triggered on sparc64, since that's faster than asking you to fix a bug
that you are unlikely to be able to trigger on your own systems.
But that's just how I operate.
Ask Thomas Gleixner.  Every single hrtimers/nohz bug I've found on
sparc64, I sent him either a full fix or a full analysis of the bug
and a description of exactly what is going on and what needs to be
changed so he can compose the bug fix patch with minimal effort.
I don't ask people to revert, ever.  It's never necessary when the
parties involved are extremely competent and responsive.
