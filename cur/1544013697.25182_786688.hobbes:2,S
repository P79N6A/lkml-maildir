It's wrong, however:
#define asmlinkage CPP_ASMLINKAGE __attribute__((regparm(0)))

This assumes regparm=3, i.e !asmlinkage.

I think we already have a patch in the tree that changes this to:
asmlinkage unsigned long sys_sigreturn(struct pt_regs regs)
... although doing it as a pointer is better, but requires a change to
the asmlinkage thing.
Getting rid of __attribute__((regparm(0))) for asmlinkage on i386 would
definitely be good, but is a bigger thing than only these couple of
functions.
