Speaking of which, does anybody know a feasible (as in "not too much harder
than manually typing it in manually") way to OCR characters from vga text
mode screen captures - or even digican shots? 
The vga text mode captures are from a remote administration interface (such
as HP RILOE or vmware gsx console) so they are pixel perfect and OCR should
be doable. The digican shots on the other hand... Well at least it would
have hack value :).
(My personal opinion is that Linus' unwillingness to include anything like
kmsgdump (
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/kmsgdump/
) is somewhat unfortunate.)
