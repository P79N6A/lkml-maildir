Not a option.  You can have to had _several_ configurations around
(here at MandrakeSoft we have normal/smp/enterprise) and we have
basically everything that can be compiled as modules compiled as
modules.  Add to that that we build the alpha (normal&smp) from the
same package.  We want to add more architectures to the rpm.  Are you
really serious that _answering_ all the options for several kernels is
an option?  I don't think so.  And the actual olconfig target works
well for me (tm).  I don't see the point to rewrote the configuration
language and made it _less_ powerfull for no good reason.
Later, Juan.
