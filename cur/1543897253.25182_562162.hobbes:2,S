What boards have we seen this on?  It's quite possible this is:
a) an iommu-related problem specific to AMD or specific to Intel
b) a BIOS problem that atl1 happens to be a victim of
I'd rather not disable this unconditionally if we can get more 
information about why it's breaking.  Doing so might just end up 
covering up the most obvious manifestation of a larger problem.
