I'm wondering if this can this be done a lot more simply with assembler
macros.
The below example generates the right code.  It's then just a matter of
getting the redefined pushfl and popfl macros into kernel-wide scope. 
Possibly an explicit `-include' in the makefile system.
asm("
	.macro	popfl
	testl	$(1<<9), 0(%esp)
	jz	69003f
	.byte	0x9d		# popfl
	sti
	jmp	69004f
69003:
	.byte	0x9d		# popfl
	cli
69004:                
	.endm
");
foo()
{
	asm("popfl\n");
}
