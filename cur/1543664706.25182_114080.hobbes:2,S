Jeff Garzik whined about how much stack space was being used by
extract_entropy().  So I went and looked and reclaimed 352 bytes of stack.
Damn SHA ...
It's actually worse (better?) than that -- xfer_secondary_pool() can call
extract_entropy() again, so I may have saved over 700 bytes of stack
usage here.  It's safe for xfer_secondary_pool() to share its parent's
tmp because it hasn't been used at this point.
