and? You can 'manipulate' arbitrary userspace memory, be that used by 
the kernel or not, and you can do a sys_futex(FUTEX_WAKE) on any 
arbitrary userspace memory address too (this is a core property of 
futexes). You must have meant something specific when you said "on the 
surface looks like a malicious users dream variable". In other words: 
please move your statement out of innuendo by backing it up with 
specifics (or by retracting it) - right now it's hanging in the air :)
