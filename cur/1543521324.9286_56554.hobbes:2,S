Nobody's downloaded the 0.9 patch yet, so they wouldn't be in a position
to make any technical judgements about the quality of the code, would
they? The only problems I know of are:
* If the ramdisk runs out of space whilst downloading a compressed image,
under some circumstances the gunzip code locks up. It's a problem in the
generic kernel gunzip stuff (lib/inflate.c) that I haven't bothered to
work around. The gunzip code is a real mess of global variables and stuff,
so I don't want to try to fix it in case I break it in some subtle way.
Since we are usually unable to boot anyway after this point because the
image is too big to fit, it's not really important.
* > 32MB downloads don't work due to a bug in netkit-tftpd. If you fixed
tftpd, I believe you could download files of an arbitrary length.
* When trying to get an arp response from a non existant server, the
kernel generates a spurious "neighbour table overflow" warning.
* Menuconfig doesn't seem to be able to create empty string options. ie.
if you enter a value for one of the strings in the configuration, the only
way to get rid of it again is to edit .config by hand.
