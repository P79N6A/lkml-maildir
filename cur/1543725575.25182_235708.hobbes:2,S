Ideally, yes.  However, there isn't currently a scheduling policy that
allows the softirq thread to run as a moderately high priority
realtime thread for a short period of time, and drop it to a low
priority non-realtime thread if it runs for longer than it "should".
Running it as one high priority non-realtime task would work if all
you want to run are non-realtime tasks and very high priority RT
tasks (which are intended to have higher priority than softirqs). 
This is assuming that a high-priority non-RT task will always preempt
a lower priority task except when it has depleted its timeslice; I'm
not familiar enough with the current scheduler to know whether that
is the case.

Splitting it that way would be nice from the perspective of giving
the user the ability to place more importance on certain types of
softirqs, but it's not what I was trying to do with the high/low
threads.

The dual-thread model is about as simple as the immediate/thread
split that is currently there, IMHO, and while not perfect, it is an
improvement over having to pick only one policy/priority given the
current choices of policy.
