You mean dentry->d_fsdata pointing to nsproxy should take a ref count on
nsproxy? afaics it is not needed as long as you first drop the dentry
before freeing associated nsproxy.

I don't understand this.

I don't have a authoritative view here on whether open file count should
be migrated or not, but from a layman perspective consider this:
	- Task T1 is in Container C1, whose max open files can be 100
	- T1 opens all of those 100 files
	- T1 migrates to Container C2, but its open file count is not
	  migrated
	- T2 is migrated to container C1 and tries opening a file but is 
	  denied. T2 looks for "who is in my container who has opened all
	  files" and doesn't find anyone.
Isn't that a bit abnormal from an end-user pov?

Filesystem root dentry's are special case. They will point to
init_nsproxy which is never deleted and hence they need not add
additional ref counts.
For other directories created, say H1/foo, foo's dentry will point to N1
but need not take additional refcount. N1 won't be deleted w/o dropping
foo's dentry first. I think this is very similar to cpuset case, where
dentry->d_fsdata = cs doesnt take additional ref counts on cpuset.

Again I am not a VM expert to say whether pages should get migrated or
not. But coming to the impact of this discussion on xxx_rmdir() ..

I agree we shouldn't delete a dir going by just the task count. How abt
a (optional) ->can_destroy callback which will return -EBUSY if additional 
non-task objects are pointing to a subsyste's resource object?
