Well, works and effective are two things. In the worst case it

Which is even more broken. Rechecking is less deterministic as the
global lock fall back solution.

No, userspace can request deadlock checking and we have to return
-EDEADLK in that case.
[EDEADLK]
        A deadlock condition was detected or the current thread already
        owns the mutex.
Returning false positives might break well designed applications and
prevent real deadlock detection.
Btw, your get/put_task proposal adds two atomic ops. Atomic ops are
implicit memory barriers and therefor you add two extra slow downs into
the non conflict case.
