Unless there is new API, leave old in place.

Why it is not going to work? I told you couple of times that without
migrating VT from one framebuffer to another your system does not bring
nothing. And btw, all my proposed changes REMOVE 'con' parameter from
fbdev functions - I think that it is removing VT-awareness from fbdev,
not removing features from fbdev you are doing.

Then alloc con2fb_map by kmalloc. Or use pointer in vc_cons and do
  if (vc_cons[i]->fb_info != info) return -EXDEV;

We have working system. Migrating to your changes moves system to nonworking
state. Sorry.

And why we should manage current state in info->var? Why not in
info->currhw->var? I do not believe that copying data from one place
to another and then back is correct solution. Maybe I'm too tied to
database systems, but if you have duplicated information, you cannot
have it right.

How you come to this strange idea? I want to remove calling
fb_set_cmap driver function if con != currcon. Your patches do not
address it. Your patches address that I must copy data from one
area to another on set_var.

Yes. So add wrappers into fbcon - and if you prove that you must change
fbdev interface, lets go. But you are still trying to put some strange
interface which brings nothing, but now even breaks source compatibility 
between 2.2 and 2.4 lines. Without reason. I.e. features are missing,
interface is more complicated.

Please face to it. We have FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO. FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO is
VT aware. Couple of applications believes that it is right thing to have
FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO VT aware. If you want to remove it, please add
vt ioctl for 2.4. And then you can talk about removing FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO
in 2.6. But in any case you cannot change FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO semantic!
