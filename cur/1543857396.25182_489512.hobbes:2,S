The same kernel binary runs on CPUs with 
different cache line sizes. For example P4 has 128 bytes, Core2 64 bytes.
However there is a worst case alignment that is used for static
alignments which is L1_CACHE_BYTES. It would be normally 128 bytes
on a x86 kernel, unless it is especially compiled for a CPU with
a smaller cache line size.
