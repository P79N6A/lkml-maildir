The POSIX-defined userspace concept of a PID requires that all threads 
appear to have the same PID. This is something that Linux didn't comply 
with under the old LinuxThreads implementation and was finally fixed 
with NPTL. This isn't a POSIX-defined interface, but I assume it's 
trying to be consistent with getpid(), etc.
