I'd done a similar thing, but just using smp_call_function (I hacked the
interrupt routine to fish pt_regs back out, and override *info in some
cases). Doing NMIs, as you've done, is probably nicer, but a lot more
work.
The problem with it (and my patch too) is that you're hooking into arch
specific code from generic code, which means you'll break every other
arch apart from i386. Fixing this is a pain in the rear end, but would
be needed to merge the patch. OTOH, the patch is extremely useful, so
would be nice to fix if you have the energy ...
