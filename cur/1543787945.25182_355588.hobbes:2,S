No, the semantics are that at least 'min' objects must be able to
be allocated at one time. The user must be able to proceed far enough
to release its objects in this case, and that ensures no deadlock.
The problem with using the pool first is that it requires the lock
to be taken and is also not NUMA aware. So from a scalability point of
view, I don't think it is a good idea.
Perhaps you could introduce a new mempool allocation interface to do
it your way?
