Me too.  It's a GOOD IDEA.  But... heck we don't all have tape backups.

Dude come on I said put a journal in the datasystem so you DON'T get
inconsistencies like that! (A roll-back journal)

HEY!  It IS the end of the world if I lose /data/audio !!!!!!! I can't code

You forgot something.  I only risk bugs in the code, that's why there's a
journal.  You can have a bug in the filesystem code.  You're taking the
same risks doing the conversion that you are mounting th efilesystem.

Erm?  Not everyone has spare disk space or wants to be assed with it.
Those methods take more work.

that's me.  I cite that I want to go from reiser3.6 to reiser4, but I have only
one reiser3.6.  I used to have all reiserfs, and yes it was a lot faster.  Now
I want it back.
