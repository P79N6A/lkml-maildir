After fixing my nice +5 problem, I'm still seeing pretty much the same
behavior, only with the priority values lowered by five.  The entire
desktop seems a bit snappier when not under load.
I got significantly more skipping in xmms under 2.6.0-test1 than under
the O6.1 patch this time, rather than the two being seemingly the same.
The scrolling behavior in mozilla was pretty much identical to how I
described it before.
I did discover under O6.1int that I could make xmms block indefinitely
when opening a window, with fvwm's wire frame manual placement, which I
hadn't ever noticed before, but I'm not sure if that's because it
actually wasn't there before, or I just placed the windows more quickly.
So, ultimately, no real difference.
