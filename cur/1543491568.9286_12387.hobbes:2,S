!?! I keep hearing unsubstantiated rumours about this.  Since I also just happen
to contract at IBM, I am not sure if those rumours are about me or someone else.  
If anyone can provide something more specific, please let me know.  If you need 
to contact me confidentially within IBM, you know how, once you have my full name:  
I'm Linas Vepstas/Austin/IBM
BTW,  My project is *not* officially sponsored or sanctioned.  Its a stunt. Feel
free to offer me a job to allow me to continue this work :-).
