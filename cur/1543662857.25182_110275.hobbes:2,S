Hi Guys,
and my apologies for the general direction.
I have googled on this topic, asked on discussion boards
and couldn't find any suitable hints.
The problem that I encounter is happening on a mobile P4.
When apm is active (I've compiled it as a module in
both a 2.4.18 and 2.4.20 kernel) my system clock errs
by as much as 90 seconds in an hour. Also, I seem to
experience keyboard related problems (Ctrl, Alt, Shift get
*sticky* -excuse my wording, I can't think of a better 
description- that is, if I press them while typing normally,
even though they are released physically their functionality
carries on. Also the cursor keys sometimes issue numbers rather
than cursor-movement) when apm is running.
The machine in question is a IBM Thinkpad R32, mobile P4 1.8GHz,
512MB RAM.
I'm running Slackware Linux 8.1 with stock kernels.
Note that the identical setup worked flawless on my
previous notebook, a PII 266, same brand (TP770ED)
and that according to IBM (I sent the box in for service
because I couldn't test whether it works with XP because
I wiped it) the machine has no problems in Windows.
