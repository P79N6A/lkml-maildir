Or equally fix the kernel driver to do interrupt mitigation.  From
the article that looks like all they have managed to achieve.  There
may be a valid argument buried in there for remote DMA as well.
But given in the low contention case the kernel with it's own network
drivers was twice as fast.  tcp/ip offload looks to have some serious
weaknesses even for iSCSI.  The embedded processor kept better
performance going for just a little while but then it's performance
crashed as well.
Plus there is the general rule.  The primary CPU, it's memory, and
it's I/O subsystem improve out of necessity, while IO processors
stagnate, because they can.  The only exception to this I have seen
are graphics coprocessors.
