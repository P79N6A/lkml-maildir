 I'm trying to make the things work the same way as with the old
 interface. Once this new code will be as stable as the old one, new
 features can be added. 
 Concurrent reads are certainly possible, but we'd need to lock
 out writes in proper places, and I do not feel safe
 to do it at this stage.

 Ditto, plus there's the irq data inside

 Yes. But I've checked the code and should not harm. I've asked
 for that a couple of weeks ago in this same mailing list
 and got no answer. If there's a working alternative to obtain
 the same result, I'm obviously willing to try.

 What the code implements is actually an interface, so this should
 be the riht place. It is also fully optional, everything could work
 without it. Probably the interface implementation hasn't all the primitives
 to handle this kind of work, but I'm not willing to go into that right now ;)
 Thank you for your hard work Dmitry, after weeks viewing the same
 code I'm going to be lost in all of those locks issues ;)
