Well, I've done quite a bit of
	#ifdef __i386__
	#define __NR_futex	240
	#elif defined (__alpha__)
	#define __NR_futex	394
	#elif defined (__mips__)
	... etc. ...
	#endif
In order to distribute programs which compile with a distro's libc but
will take advantage of features in later kernels when run on them.
That's really unpleasant.  So, in revenge, here's an annoying question:
If userspace applications are ultimately compiled using Linux header
files, indirectly included via Glibc or some other libc, and the
kernel header files are GPL (version 2 only; not LGPL or any later
GPL), isn't distributing those binary applications a gross violation
of the GPL in some cases?
