I can confirm the whole thing.
I have:
cable modem & NIC, using DHCP, no PPPoE or anything like that
heartbeat tunnel from Sixxs.net
Gentoo Linux
Kernel 2.6.7 vanilla, gcc 3.3.3
I have worked with Pasi a couple of days now and he has crashed my
machine many times. With the help of a serial terminal I have gathered
some information about the crashes, including kernel oops/panic messages
and tcpdump output.
The information is here:
http://www.hack.fi/~pq/
My machine crashes immediately when someone runs a tracepath6 on me,
unless I have ip6table_filter module loaded.
To get to the vulnerable state all I have to do is to boot (to single
user mode), bring inet interface up and establish the tunnel.
We have not yet tested if it works with 6to4 connection also.
The data at the URL is somewhat censored, but I can provide the original
data and any other information if needed.
I am also willing to assist in solving the problem, try out patches etc.
I am not a subscriber to LKML.
