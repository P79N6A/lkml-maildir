As I already said, deflate() in this case does only ONE iteration.
stream.avail_in is NOT changed in the loop (except of the deflate()
itself, where it will be set to 0 - provided out buffer have enouth
room).  So the whole while loop does only ONE iteration, returning
Z_NEED_DATA or something the next one.  So no, the semantics here
(actual semantics) does NOT change.
