Something which I forgot to add when mentioning my ioremap patch is
that you can pretty much forget about adding request_mem_region() to the
same drivers since both changes are in the same spot of code and doing
one without doing the other is kind of silly. (i.e. the patches I have
for 8390 based drivers do both at once).
Although simply having a dev->vmem [or dev->base] added to struct
netdevice in 2.4.0, as was discussed many months ago(*) might go a long
way in allowing driver back-compatibility from 2.5.x into 2.4.x - probably
worthwhile.
