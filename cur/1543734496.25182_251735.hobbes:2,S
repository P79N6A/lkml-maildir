While resuming adding __user annotations to the m68k-specific parts of the
code, I stumbled on
    struct task_struct {
	...
	unsigned long sas_ss_sp;
	...
    }
If I'm not mistaken, sas_ss_sp is always a pointer to user stack space.
Shouldn't it be changed to `void __user *sas_ss_sp', or is an
unsigned long/void * change in generic code a too controversial change for
making sparse happy?
And I guess I can find a few more of these...
