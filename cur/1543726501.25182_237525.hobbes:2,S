Hi,
  My paper, "Encrypted Watermarks and Linux Laptop Security" which
describes the watermark attack recently discussed in "Delete cryptoloop"
thread was earlier this week accepted to WISA 2004 (Korea, Aug 23-25.).
I previously restricted its distribution due to the anonymous
review process. A current draft version is now available from:

  All comments are welcome (on list or private).
Cheers,
