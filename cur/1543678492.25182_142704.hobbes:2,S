Hi,
first I want to say that I could compile 2.4.22-pre1 without problems and 
everything works fine for 4 hours on a desktop machine with little load.
However, I had a small problem during my installation:
After the first compilation and reboot, I started menuconfig again and all 
subentries of "ACPI support" were gone. I took a brief look at the .config, 
but there were at least some entries.
So I ignored this, changed my config via menuconfig, recompiled and rebooted 
and ACPI was gone ;-(
After copying my old config and "make oldconfig", everything was back to 
normal. Unfortunately i wasn't able to reproduce this error.
I just wanted to let you know...
