yes and no... basically vanilla 2.4.14 doesn't support ext3,
although you can patch it to get ext3.
either you want to try 2.4.15pre8 and you have to patch your 2.4.14
with
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/testing/patch-2.4.15-pre8.gz
or you can patch 2.4.14 with the ext3 patch at :
http://beta.redhat.com/index.cgi?action=ext3
or you can wait for 2.4.15
