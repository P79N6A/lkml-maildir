Hi Bart,
Thanks !! the patch solves the kernel panic but when after applying the patch,kernel is not
able to mount the filesystem and panics, am i not sure what is likely causing the panic.
Creating root device.
Mounting root filesystem.
mount: could not  find filesystem
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
