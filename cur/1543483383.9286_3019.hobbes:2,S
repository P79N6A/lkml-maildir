Well it looks like I should have investigated more, you're right.  I
assumed this application operated similarly on both operating systems, but
it does not.  On Solaris it spawns a single multi-threaded process which (I
assume) uses the correct number of threads.  On Linux, it spawns multiple
instances of a process - but uses the wrong number!  If given the parameter
P=2, which is supposed to mean 2 CPU's it spawns 3 processes.  So at P=4 it
was spawning 5 processes.  Consider this a retraction.

unfortunately, your message was fairly unuseful, since it was missing
any information about what the QC app was actually doing.  for instance,
was it doing lots of IPC?  file IO?  was it thrashing?  mmaped IO?
if none of the above, do you theorize that it was thrashing pages
due to Linux's lack of page coloring?  Linux developers are definitely
interested, but you have to remember that for the apps developers most
frequently see (parallel makes), Linux scales _nearly_perfectly_.
claiming Linux can't scale to 4x is downright irresponsible unless
you define exactly what you mean...
