How does the generated code change?  Does gcc do something stupid like
statically allocate a prototype structure full of zeros, and then memcpy
it in?  Or does it generate a series of explicit assignments for each
member?  Or does it generate a memset anyway?
Seems to me that this gives gcc the opportunity to be more stupid, and
the only right answer is what we're doing anyway.
