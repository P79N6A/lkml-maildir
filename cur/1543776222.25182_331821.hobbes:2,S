this is where serial logging (or netconsole/netlogging) may be useful.
do you have DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW and latency tracing still enabled?  The 
combination of those two options is pretty good at detecting stack 
overflows. Also, you might want to enable CONFIG_4KSTACKS, that too 
disturbs the stack layout enough so that the error message may make it 
to the console.
