I certainly will work on collating them - over time it will get less and
less of a win. A lot of the now very visible ones are really hard to fix in 2.4 
and will be 2.5 things (like block). And when you fix block you'll find the
next one and so on forever

Im running both 2.4.18/19pre2 on laptops. PLIP still doesnt work but at
least I think I now understand why. If you want to hack on plip ping
Tim Waugh <twaugh@redhat.com> he's definitely as far from the Al Viro end
of polite computing as you can get and can probably tell you what bits you
need to tweak
