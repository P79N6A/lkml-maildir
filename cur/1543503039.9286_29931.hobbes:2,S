Either you've misunderstood what was said, or I have, I'm not sure
which: My understanding is that the "warning shot" says "We are
running low on memory and are likely to run out very shortly. Please
reduce your memory requirement."
If so, then the "warning shot" is fired BEFORE memory runs out, not
after...
Best wishes from Riley.
