Oh, interesting.  Note that we already allocate from the pid space for 
other things, so it's entirely doable.  Another choice would be to simply 
disallow the thread group leader from exec'ing.  Linux threads traditionally 
try to remain as close to process behaviour as possible, and allowing an 
individual thread to exec is very useful, so I'm still in favour of 
allocating a new tgid.
