Sure it would.  It would make the likelihood for errors much lower.
You need to make tarballs anyway.

I think this is much too absolutist of an approach.  There is *always*
a possibility for errors to happen, but automation can reduce the risk

If Marcelo wants, I can write him a "bless" script that he can run
directly on master.kernel.org, which would make it trivial to avoid
error.
