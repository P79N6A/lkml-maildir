Yes, this was a pleasant surprise indeed :)
This useless mail from a mere user is just to testify that I've used reiser4 
on my laptop since June 2004, and that, barring occasional hiccups, I never 
had serious problems with it. In fact I haven't lost a single bit of data 
despite crashes and cold shutdowns due to power outage.
I don't know if this means something or if I've just been lucky, but it seems 
to me that when reiser4 crashes (and sometimes it does, given its young age), 
it behaves very very well. That's the thing that impressed me the most (and 
it is really something, given for example the debacle of a mature filesystem 
like XFS in 2.6.17). Oh, and performance, of course ;)
I really hope that the technical difficulties that are preventing reiser4 from 
entering mainline will be sorted out soon.
Thanks,
  Francesco (crawling back in the shadow)
