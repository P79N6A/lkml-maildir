Passing the page* down one more level would permit cbc_process() to get at
the pageframes themselves, so it can sanely determine if src and dest
overlap.  (I assume this is for encryption-in-place).
Or maybe it's sufficient for crypt() to pass a simple boolean down to the
prfn() callout which says "this is in-place encryption".
