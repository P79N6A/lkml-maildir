Currently only x86 implements smp_prepare_cpu(). On other arch, it is a
no-op. Hence yes, only x86 is exposed to this bug.

Well ..other arch-es need to have a similar check if they get around to
implement physical hot-add (even if they allow offlining of all CPUs). This is 
required since a user can (by mistake maybe) try to bring up an already online 
CPU by writing a '1' to it's sysfs 'online' file. 'store_online' 
(drivers/base/cpu.c) unconditionally calls 'smp_prepare_cpu' w/o checking for 
this error condition. The check added in the patch catches such error 
conditions as well.

Sorry about not commenting my code earlier! How does the patch below look?
Add check for online cpus.
