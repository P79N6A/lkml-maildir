This is what I think:
[   44.482064] INFO: 0xf5f320c0-0xf5f320c0. First byte 0x6a instead of 0x6b
...
[   44.482064]   Object 0xf5f320c0:  6a 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b
6b 6b 6b 6b 6b jkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Only the first byte has been changed. It changed from 0x6b to 0x6a.
Smells like a decrement. And yes, this particular cache allocates
'struct key's, which has an 'atomic_t usage' as its first member. So a
refcounting bug, most likely (key_put() was called too many times). Or
a missing key_get() somewhere?
It also seems noteworthy that no other data has been changed since the
last key_put() (i.e. since the refcount hit zero).
[   44.482064] Bytes b4 0xf5f320b0:  7c 05 ff ff 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a
5a 5a 5a 5a 5a |.��ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
...I guess "bytes b4" means "bytes before"?
