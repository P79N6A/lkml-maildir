The next problem I have relates to irq sharing. 
On my laptop I can't avoid it :
 10:    1070631          XT-PIC  yenta, yenta, uhci_hcd, Intel
82801CA-ICH3, hdsp, eth0
If I set the sound card's interrupt to be non threaded, then I get a
rather long non preemptible section :
http://www.undata.org/~thomas/irq_sharing.trace
As a side note, and this has already been reported here several times,
the SA_INTERRUPT flag set notably by the sound card drivers handlers is
not honored on current kernels if the device is not the first one to be
registered. A simple fix would be to add SA_INTERRUPT handlers at the
beginning instead of the end of the irq queue in setup_irq.
Similarly, when using SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM, all devices on the given irq
contribute to the entropy, even those that have a predictable interrupt
rate (e.g. sound cards), and/or for which the number of interrupts could
outweight the number of interrupts of the original SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM
driver.
