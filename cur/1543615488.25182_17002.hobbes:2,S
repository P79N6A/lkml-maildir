Needing to type 'struct' everywhere is annoying and makes for long lines.
Other than that it's harmless, and actually, the situation where you have two 
ways of spelling everything is annoying too.  Anyway, if it was to be done,
I'd spell it:
	typedef struct super_struct super;
	typedef struct inode_struct inode;
	static inline inode *new_inode(super *sb)
	{
		inode *ni = (inode *) malloc(sizeof(inode));
		...
	}
It won't happen though, because it would generate a massive diff for the sole 
reason of making things prettier, and a very high percentage of existing 
patches would break immediately.  If you're going to clean stuff up, you have 
to do it a bit at a time while you're working on other things.
