But how would you suggest people using 2.2 configure their
Apache?  Will flock/fcntl or semaphores perform better (albeit
"uglier") than unserialized accept()'s in 2.2.  I'm willing
and expecting to rebuild apache when 2.4 is released.  I do
not, though, want to leave performance on the table today,
just so I can say that my apache binary is 2.4-ready.
Do any of the apache serialization methods (flock/fcntl/semops)
have any performance improvement over unserialized accept() with
Apache running on a 2.2 kernel?
