Yes. That's better. It may have been a diagnostic error
in the code of the first person reporting this --also.
The data-rate is so high that I might have wrapped several
times! I didn't think it would be that high, only 2 to 3
gigibyte/second, not over 4 Gb/s (with 130MHz RAM no less)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <time.h>
#define BUF_LEN 0x10000
volatile unsigned long long amount = 0L;
void timer(int unused) {
    fprintf(stdout, "Kilobytes / sec = %llu\n", amount >> 10);
    fflush(stdout);
    amount = 0LL;
    alarm(1);
}
int main() {
    int fd, len;
    char *buf;
    if((fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR)) < 0)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    if((buf = malloc(BUF_LEN)) == NULL)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    (void)signal(SIGALRM, timer);
    alarm(1);
    while((len = write(fd, buf, BUF_LEN)) > 0)
        amount += (unsigned long long) len;
    free(buf);
    return 0;
}
With network:
Kilobytes / sec = 46170080
Kilobytes / sec = 46171576
Kilobytes / sec = 46172944
Kilobytes / sec = 46172192
Kilobytes / sec = 46171840
Kilobytes / sec = 46171576
Without network:
Kilobytes / sec = 46128168
Kilobytes / sec = 46128200
Kilobytes / sec = 46128152
Kilobytes / sec = 46128142
Kilobytes / sec = 46128208
Kilobytes / sec = 46128198
Kilobytes / sec = 46128202
Its interesting that the data-rate is higher with the network
plugged in and getting all those M$ broadcast messages. But, as
expected, its more stable without.
Cheers,
