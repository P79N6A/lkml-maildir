I'd have thought that we'd want the test right at the start of
kobject_add() - fail it if ->name is zero.  I don't know if that'd work for
all callers, but kobject_add() does play around with the ->name field and
will go oops if ->name==NULL and debugging is enabled.
Why did you choose kobject_get_path()?
