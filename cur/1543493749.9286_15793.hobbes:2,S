The issue I see with using PageLocked for synchronizing writes to a page
is that it doesn't work with mmaped pages.  Consider two different users
on the same machine mmap the same page read/write, read the page so it faults
in.  And then write to the mapped page.  Later when msync is called or
the swapper kicks in we notice the page is dirty, and write it out.
Basically I contend that using PageLocked as a "data coherency lock"
is broken, at least when using the generic code.  Unix doesn't
garantee data coherency, on writes.  That's why we have file locks
and append mode.  And since the consistency is up to the application,
or up to a specific filesystem, why do we have some of the
implementation in generic code (particularly generic_file_write)?
