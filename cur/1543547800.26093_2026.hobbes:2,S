Linus,
IPX is a really good LAN protocol (but totally sucks for internet).  A
full blown NCP server in-kernel that's toughtly coupled to the page
cache running over IPX would make flames shoot out of the back of a
Linux server, and make NT like look an old lady hobbling down the
street.  There's no need to configure client addresses with it, and for
file and print, it's the best.
