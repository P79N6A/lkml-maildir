Not quite -- pre-patches are a one-big-patch, diffed against the most
recently released kernel.  Perl could easily parse the linux/Makefile
kernel version and deduce the BK tag (used for diffing) from that.
Finally, I'm not sure that BK can generate these kind of diffs, can it?
One quality of all traditional Linus pre-patches and patches is that
if you have N csets modifying a single file, you see N gnu-style diff
modifications, instead of the single one you would get when generating
the patch via GNU diff.
Also, (assuming Linus wants this, of course) I would want the
'linuspush' script to increment the pre-patch and check in that change,
before pushing.
