Sorry for the delay, it took me some time to RTF code and convince
myself that nothing can tickle this driver's sysfs files after a
CPU_DOWN_PREPARE_FROZEN.  As long as I didn't misread that...

PS: while reading kernel/power/disk.c, I saw this...
335 static void power_down(void)
336 {
337         switch (hibernation_mode) {
338         case HIBERNATION_TEST:
339         case HIBERNATION_TESTPROC:
340                 break;
341         case HIBERNATION_REBOOT:
342                 kernel_restart(NULL);
343                 break;
344         case HIBERNATION_PLATFORM:
345                 hibernation_platform_enter();
346         case HIBERNATION_SHUTDOWN:
347                 kernel_power_off();
348                 break;
349         }
350         kernel_halt();
351         /*
352          * Valid image is on the disk, if we continue we risk serious data
353          * corruption after resume.
354          */
355         printk(KERN_CRIT "Please power me down manually\n");
356         while(1);
357 }
Shouldn't that be while(1) cpu_relax(); ?
