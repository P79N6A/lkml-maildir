Why not have the /proc/config option but instead of being plain text, 
make it binary with a userspace app that can interpret it?
It could have a signature as to kernel version + patches and the rest 
would be just bits.
Instead of:
CONFIG_X86=y
CONFIG_ISA=y
# CONFIG_SBUS is not set
CONFIG_UID16=y
You'd have
2.4.3-pre3:1101111100000100000000 . . . . .
