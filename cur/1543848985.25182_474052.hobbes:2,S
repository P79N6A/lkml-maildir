While that may make some sense internally, the exported interface would
never be workable like that. It needs to be simple, "give me foo kb/sec
with max latency bar for this file", with an access pattern or assumed
sequential io.
Nobody speaks of iops/sec except some silly benchmark programs. I know
that you are describing pseudo-iops, but it still doesn't make it more
clear.
Things aren't as simple
