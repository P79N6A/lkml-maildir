Netscape was open sourced too and look what it took to bring it where
it is now. This is not your average 2,500 lines GNU tool. Even the
Linux kernel isn't that complex. It is written in a much simpler
language (C vs. C++) and if you remove all the drivers, you end up
with quite a compact core.
OpenOffice installed more than 300 (!) Megabytes software while RedHat
8 install. Linux kernel with all options is what? 2 MBytes?
I'd think, most people simply underestimate the complexity of some
dozen millions of lines of projected, specified and engineered
code. This isn't the same league as your average php open source
project. Maybe not even the same discipline.
Enough exercising for you?
