Subject: [PATCH] x86: delete vsyscall files during make clean
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/17/375

make clean failed to delete a few files in
x86/kernel. This is because kbuild does not
see the correct/full kernel/Makefile.
As a workaround until the Makefiles are merged specify
the files to be deleted in the common Makefile.
