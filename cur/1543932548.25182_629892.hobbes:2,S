That would be great, Pavel.  I do prefer your solution over my LSM, so
if we can get an elegant block device control right in the vfs code that
would be my preference.
The only thing that makes me keep wanting to go back to an LSM is the
fact that the code defining the whitelist seems out of place in the vfs.
But I guess that's actually separated into a modular cgroup, with the
actual enforcement built in at the vfs.  So that's really the best
solution.
