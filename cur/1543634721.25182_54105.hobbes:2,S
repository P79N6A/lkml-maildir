Subject: [PATCH][RFC] VISWS support for 2.5.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
attached patch is a forward port of Sourceforge VISWS support patch.
Changes since 2.5.23:
	1) make VISWS sound driver compile again;
	2) replace probe_irq_on(), probe_irq_off() with dummy inlines,
	   instead of ugly #ifdef's in irq.c.
Compiles, untested. Please take a look at it.
