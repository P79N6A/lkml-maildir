When LINUX detects a recently plugged in PCI card (hot swappable), Which 
function of PCMCIA package is invoked by the LINUX O/S to notify the 
device driver?
In other words, In case of hot-swappable cards, how the insertion and 
removal of pnp cards is notified to the device driver in LINUX.
P.S. We use PCI cards.
Thanks and regards,
