   The point I don't like about update_mmu_cache() is that it's called 
   _after_ set_pte(). Practically it's maybe not a problem right now, but 
   the cache synchronization should happen before set_pte().
update_mmu_cache() is specifically supposed to always occur before
anyone could try to use the mapping created.
If this is ever violated, it will be fixed because it is a BUG().
So I don't see what you're worried about.
If the above were not true, sparc64 wouldn't be able to compile
a kernel successfully. :-)
