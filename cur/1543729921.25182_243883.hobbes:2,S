i got many oops from the ext3 commit and this because all of the 
schedulers in the 2.6.8 and 2.6.8.1 traffic control suite are accessing 
data at slightly wrong positions.
this because if any discipline different from pfifo fast is used, the 
kmalloc()ed memory is aligned in the old way, but then it is used in the 
new one.
the results could be catastrophic whenever the accessed data is a 
pointer and the memory referenced is written to. :-\
