Certainly.  It _shouldn't_ be too tricky adding that to the PM core,
but there are issues including how to get the locking right when
tasks are concurrently walking the device tree.  The issue comes
up with PCI/Cardbus hotplugging too, so it's not really offtopic ... ;)

There's a window between "unplug" and "khubd notices unplug"
where requests give controller-specific status reports, some of which
translate directly to "not responding".  The driver's fault recovery
mechanism will eventually start seeing "device gone", once khubd
notices.  Other than network drivers, most drivers usually see the
"gone" status first, or disconnect() if they had no pending URBs.
That's much the same as PCMCIA/Cardbus:  register reads will
return ~0 for a while before disconnect notification.
