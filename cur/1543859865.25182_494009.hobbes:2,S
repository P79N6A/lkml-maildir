This problem happens on kernel-2.6.19-git4 or later.
but does _not_ happen on kernel-2.6.19-git3.
So this problem is introduced to kernel-2.6.19-git4.
I tried the Marvell 88E8001(skge) and Realtek 8139(8139too),
the same problem happens.
I think this is not a network-card-driver problem.
Thanks!
Best Regards
