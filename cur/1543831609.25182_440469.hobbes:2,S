Well, there's some cases where you don't want coherent mappings but
rather alloc_page + dma_map_*.  And having a ZONE_DMA32 that is valid
on all architectures is very valueable for that.
I remember James promised a kmalloc_mask a last Kernel Summit that would
many things easier, but even than having predictable memory zone layouts
overy different architectures is a win.
