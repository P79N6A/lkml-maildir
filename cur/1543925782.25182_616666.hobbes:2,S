Do you feel that making us feel and look like shit helps?
I guess I'm just masterbating here all night long with the 46
bug fixes I've reviewed fully and queued up into my tree.  Along
with all the 10 or so -stable submissions I did tonight as well.
When someone like me is bug fixing full time, I take massive offense
to the impression you're trying to give especially when it's directed
at the networking.
So turn it down a notch Andrew.
I bet if you did things like list explicitly by name every single
person who adds a bug fix (however trivial) to an -mm release instead
of a new feature, you'll better achieve your goal than what you're
doing here.
