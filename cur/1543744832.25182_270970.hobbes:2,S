from glibc-2.3.3(RHEL4b2):
   31 int
   32 __pthread_cond_signal (cond)
   33      pthread_cond_t *cond;
   34 {
   35   /* Make sure we are alone.  */
   36   lll_mutex_lock (cond->__data.__lock);
   37
   38   /* Are there any waiters to be woken?  */
   39   if (cond->__data.__total_seq > cond->__data.__wakeup_seq)
   40     {
   41       /* Yes.  Mark one of them as woken.  */
   42       ++cond->__data.__wakeup_seq;
   43       ++cond->__data.__futex;
   44
   45       /* Wake one.  */
   46       lll_futex_wake (&cond->__data.__futex, 1);
   47     }
   48
   49   /* We are done.  */
   50   lll_mutex_unlock (cond->__data.__lock);

   52   return 0;
   53 }
Ingo, is this buggy?
We should start again with a question:
   Is this a kernel's bug or NPTL's bug?
Thanks,
