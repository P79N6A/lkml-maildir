Losing kpiod isn't an optimization ;(. Losing kpiod is the MAP_SHARED bugfix.
The problem was:
o	swap_out
o	wants to flush a MAP_SHARED dirty page to disk
o	so allocate kpiod-struct
o	sumbit the page-flush request to kpiod
o	don't wait I/O completion to avoid deadlocking on the i_sem
o	swap_out returns 1 and memory balancing code so thinks we did progress
	in freeing memory and goes to allocate memory from the freelist
	without waiting I/O completion
o	repeat N times the above
o	in the meantime kpiod has a big queue but it's blocked slowly writing
	those pages to disk
o	while it writes a few pages swap_out floods again the queue
	without waiting and it empties the freelist (task killed)
The problem was the lack of write throttling due the kpiod async-only nature.

Yes, the same `current' context must run the down/up pair of calls and as you
said it is legal to rely on it on all the places it's used.
