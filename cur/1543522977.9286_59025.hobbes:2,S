Ah, cool. Who's doing it? What language?

Well, in the specific case of the userland download tool we've been
discussing, that's not a problem - it's sitting on a full kernel tree (on
the server) anyway.
It would do the dependancy check as part of assembling the tarball, so
you'd get all the required files up front. The only problem is if options
are selected during "make fooconfig" that differ from the config meta-info
provided to the download tool (ie, I downloaded PPC, but I then try and
build an Intel kernel via "make xconfig") - so then a bulletproof version
of the download tool would have to muck with the makefiles/config system to
disable options that were not provided in the custom tarball.
Hairy, but doable.
