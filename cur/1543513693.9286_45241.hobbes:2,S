Subject: [2.2.13] ZMAGIC executable dumps core

System : RH5.2 + 2.2 upgrades + linux-2.2.13
I have just installed 2.2.13 at home, coming from 2.2.12, and a ZMAGIC
executables of xdvi (from an old TeX distribution I still have around)
dumps core on launch. Going back to 2.2.12, everything is fine.
I have the same executable at work which runs fine with 2.2.13pre15,
and will try to see in which 2.2.13preXX this appeared.
Of course, this is not much of a problem as an upgrade of my TeX setup
is long overdue, but I mention it in case this might be a symptom of
something more important (last time I reported about this executable
being broken, it was due to a problem with a.out programs executed
over NFS :-)
The following error messages appear in /var/log/messages : 
Oct 21 16:03:45 socrate kernel: fd_offset is not page aligned. Please
convert program: xdvi
Oct 21 16:03:45 socrate kernel: N_TXTOFF is not page aligned. Please
convert library: libXaw.so.3.1.0
There is also a warning about virtex, which however does not dump
core. 
1042 $ locate libXaw.so.3.1.0
/usr/i486-linuxaout/lib/libXaw.so.3.1.0
Now, I understand I should do something to convert these files :-),
but what surprises me is that recent versions of the kernel handled
them fine, and I found nothing in the release notes. 
The error messages seems to come from fs/binfmt_aout.c:409 : 
		if ((fd_offset & ~PAGE_MASK) != 0 &&
		    (jiffies-error_time) > 5*HZ)
		{
			printk(KERN_WARNING 
			       "fd_offset is not page aligned. Please convert program: %s\n",
			       file->f_dentry->d_name.name
			       );
			error_time = jiffies;
		}
and from fs/binfmt_aout.c:539 :
	if ((N_TXTOFF(ex) & ~PAGE_MASK) != 0) {
		static unsigned long error_time;
		if ((jiffies-error_time) > 5*HZ)
		{
			printk(KERN_WARNING 
			       "N_TXTOFF is not page aligned. Please convert library: %s\n",
			       file->f_dentry->d_name.name);
			error_time = jiffies;
		}
Looking at the patch, I see that similar warnings (about converting
the files) were present in older versions of the kernel. However, they
were not triggered at all by this executable :
