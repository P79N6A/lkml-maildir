if you mean the stock kernel, this scenario you describe is not how it
behaves, because only IRQ contexts can mark a softirq active again. And
those IRQ contexts will run do_IRQ() naturally, so while *this*
do_softirq() invocation wont run those reactivated softirqs, the IRQ
context that just triggered the softirq will do so.
the real source of softirq latencies is the local_bh_disable()/enable()
behavior, see my previous patch.
