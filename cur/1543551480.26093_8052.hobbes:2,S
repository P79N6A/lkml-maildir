I'm just wondering if I'm the only person who has had problems with
2.4.0-test9 recording on ide-scsi cdr's?
Nobody has posted anything about it and the test10-prex changefiles don't
mention it.   cdrecord reports very weird results when scanning the scsi
bus whereas dmesg shows what one would expect of the ide-scsi detection. 
anyone?
