I found an easy way to hang the kernel when copying a SD-card:
dd if=/dev/sdc of=file bs=1048576
I.e. copy the entire 256MB card in 1MB chunks.  I got about
160MB before the kernel hung.  Not even sysrq+B worked, I needed
the reset button.  The pc has a total of 512MB memory if that matters.
Using bs=4096 instead let me copy the entire card with no problems,
but that seems to progress slower.
The above 'dd' command hangs my office pc every time. So I can repeat
it for debugging purposes.
