Perhaps BitMover could release a client that can't do anything but keep a
local (unmodified) tree in sync with a public repository tree, so that the
"politically objectionable" (to some) parts of the BK license don't matter.
In an idea world, this read-only client could be released in source form, but
I'm under no illusions there :).
