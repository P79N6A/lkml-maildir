OK, lets for the sake of the argument imagine such an
elevator, with Read and Write queues for the following
block numbers:
R:  1 3 4 5 6 20 21 22 100 110 111
W:  2 15 16 17 18 50 52 53
Now imagine what switching randomly between these queues
would do for disk seeks. Especially considering that some
of the writes can be "sandwiched" in-between the reads...
