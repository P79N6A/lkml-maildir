There should be a copy of Disk Manager that you can download from Quantum's
web site.  Get it install it and that should work around the 8GB limit in
your BIOS.  Remember when installing that the disk manager must load before
booting any install program; DM gives you a prompt to boot from a floppy,
which is what you'll want to do.  An even better option, if your lucky there
may even be a BIOS update for your motherboard that eliminates the 8GB
limit.  Check your MB manufacture's webs site.
