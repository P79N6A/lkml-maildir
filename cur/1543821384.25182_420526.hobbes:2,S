he's basically right; the gain you get by disabling the generic things a
distribution enabled is way down in the noise. There are some
compromises a distribution makes to keep the number of kernels they ship
down, and I suspect the worst possible case would add up to say 5%.
(on a Fedora / RHEL that would probably be a SMP system with less than
1Gb of ram)
On the plus side you get the maintenance, building and integration done
for you, including the security fixes. 
There is a third "advantage" in using a distro kernel; there is less
chance of a mistake in the sense of picking a config option that turns
out to be really bad in hindsight. 
Now that doesn't mean that I want to discourage people from building
their own kernel, far from that, but at the same time, the advantages
you get shouldn't be overstated and in a business environment it is
probably not a good use of time nowadays.
