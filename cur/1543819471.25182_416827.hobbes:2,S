kdb does not register a die notifier.  It only does the notify_die
callouts.  Sorry for the confusion.  mca handler and xpc both register
notifiers and both have very early exits.

I think each registered notifier is adding approx 32 nSec.  Actually,
the noise on these samples was about +-9nSec which I assumed was processor
stalls on cacheline load.
I think it looks like a lot of time when viewed as nSec, but when viewed
as a percentage of process run time, it is probably not that great of
an issue which is why it has been allowed to creep by for so long.
I can not think of an easy way to diagnose this slowdown any further.
I could run through this code on the simulator so you can see which
instructions actually got executed.  Would that be helpful?
Thanks,
Robin
