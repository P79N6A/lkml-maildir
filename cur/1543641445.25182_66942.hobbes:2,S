It depends on the architecture.  8KB for x86 and most others.  Some
(all?) 64-bit platforms have 16KB stacks.
Note the effective size is actually (8KB - sizeof(task_struct)) in 2.4
and (8KB - sizeof(thread_info)) in 2.5 since those structures are stored
at the top of the stack.
Also note interrupts share the stack.

I believe 2.4-ac has a stack overflow check in it... as does the RedHat
kernel - check it out.
Also kgdb (or at least our copy here at MontaVista) has a stack overflow
check.
