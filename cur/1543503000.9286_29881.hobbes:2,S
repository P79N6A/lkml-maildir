I'll submit to your decision here, but I hope we don't become too
PC-centric.  I thought you were moving towards broadening the scope of the
kernel...  The FreeBSD guys did the same thing, they let PC-isms creep into
their "system".
If we use PCI to refer to a PCI bus, Im all for it.  But it kind of makes me
shudder to refer to an ISA block of addresses as being in PCI space.
