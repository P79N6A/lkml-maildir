Forgot to mention that the above doesn't make much sense at all. If
there are no errors, you loop through ending all the buffers. Then
you fall through and end the the first (non-existant) chunk? And
end_that_request_first does not need to hold the io_request_lock,
you can move that down to protect end_that_request_last.
