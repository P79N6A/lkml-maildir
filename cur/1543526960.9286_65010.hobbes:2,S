There are several projects already under way for this.   Nbd is already
in the main kernel tree.  gnbd and drbd are works-in-progress.

Yes, it will.

Major deadlock opportunity.  The process holding the request function
can block the other process from proceeding, because there are only a
finite number of requests available in the request table.  So you have
the network-device-using process waiting for the server process to
access the hard disk, and the server process waiting for a free
request... instant deadlock.
