OK, sounds at least somewhat plausible..

Your patch would go a lot further if it came as 2 parts:
PATCH 1/2: Add Generic B-tree implementation
PATCH 2/2: Convert mm/foobar.c to track VM pages using B-trees.
Barring an actual patch 2/2, a *clear* explanation of why it would benefit
a *specific* piece of code so somebody else can do it...
