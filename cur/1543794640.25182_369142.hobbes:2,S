Good description from Rob L. n the CDDL. No, you can't rip off 
everything and put it in Linux just because someone
put it out another another license and made it public.  ZFS will 
contaminate Linux.  There's already plenty of FS's in Linux
as it is, and who cares about some broken piece of crap from Solaris 
anyway.    Putting ZFS into Linux would help
Sun in any event and not Linux.
