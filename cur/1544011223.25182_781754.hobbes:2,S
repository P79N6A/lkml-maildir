I could be convinced to change it but like what I have.  At this point
the file is open.  If it fails after this we are going to call fput()
which calls __fput() which calls fsnotify_close().  Seemed odd to leave
a close without an open (although that's what we have today.)
This doesn't mean the syscall was successful, but the file was opened,
and it will be closed....
