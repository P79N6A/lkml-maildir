I hope Rafael knows how to cross-reference the regression fixes against his list?
I'm sitting on five ACPI patches which look like they (or alternatives?) should
be in 2.6.25:
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/acpi-ec-revert-208c70a45624400fafd7511b96bc426bf01f8f5e.patch
  This was too poorly changelogged for me to remember what problem it
  solves, but it seemed important at the time.
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/drivers-acpi-asus_acpic-correct-use-of-and.patch
  Fix logic error in asus_acpi.c
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/drivers-acpi-asus_acpic-correct-use-of-and.patch
  Fix an overrun.
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/revert-acpi-thermal-fixup.patch
  Hopeully fix a regression which Andrea Arcangeli hit.  Although I'm not sure
  that he has confirmed that this revert actually works?
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/acpi-set-flag-dock_undocking-when-triggered-via-sysfs.patch
  Fix a system lockup related to undocking.
