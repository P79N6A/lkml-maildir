No.  It is not.  The module usage count doesn't have a direct relation
to the number of open devices.  The module count just makes the modules
un-removable if it is non-zero.  It doesn't matter at all, when and where
you in- and decrease it, as long as the module is always protected against
unload when in use (e.g. opened).
