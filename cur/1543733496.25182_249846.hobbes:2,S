  It would solve the problem in Linux. However, it may not be POSIX.1
  compatible. On the other hand I read that NTFS 5.0 is POSIX.1
  compliant - and Windows uses copy system call. NTFS also has streams
  support using special character in the file names to select the
  streams.
  Surely there must be a solution in Linux that will allow things like
  streams and meta-data(meta-streams) be visible to the user.
