Does the patch in appended message fix that?

Sort of. The 4K cardbus windows are working fine for non-x86
architectures where all IO resources are usually well known
and added to the resource tree properly.
However, on x86 there are sometimes "hidden" system IO port
ranges that aren't reported by BIOS, so the large (4K) cardbus
windows overlap these ranges.
Actually I don't like reducing CARDBUS_IO_SIZE to 256 bytes, because
we lose an ability to handle cards with built-in p2p bridges (which
require 4K for IO), plus it won't fix Sony VAIO problem.
Tero and Mikael, can you try this one-liner instead?
Ivan.
