I am working on a file system driver for linux, and have run into a
problem with hard links.  I am attempting to put per-directory quota
support into the filesystem, rather than per-volume, and hard links
across quota-spaces causes some tricky semantic issues.  My favored
solutions are 1) eliminate hard links from the fs, or 2) cause link() to
create a symbolic link instead, emulating it's predicted behavior.  Does
anyone out there see any problems with the second solution that could
arise?  If it may cause problems, does anyone know of any popular
applications that require hard links?  Thanks in advance for your input!
