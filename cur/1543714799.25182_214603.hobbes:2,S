I'd suggest to keep it as simple as you can for the time beeing.  If we
ever find a user with a ISA or whatever variant he can split it out.  And
such a split would work a little different from what you did now.

It looks like nsp_cs at least tries to :-)

Hey, you don't need to apologize.   Anyt 2.6 driver is better than none and
your looks quite okay from the functional standpoint.  We just need to have
a little higher bars for new drivers as we already have lots of maintaince
overhead for old and sloppy written drivers.
