And you're failing to see the problem.

Not acceptable.
We DO NOT want to halt in ALL cases.  There is ONE case where we
definitely do want to GRACEFULLY fail and _NOT_ halt the kernel.
It seems that you're missing this case - the case where lib/inflate.c
is used elsewhere in the kernel apart from the boot time decompressors.
The behaviour you describe is perfectly reasonable for the boot time
decompressors, but _NOT_ once the kernel has been decompressed.
Sorry, I'm disgusted that it's come to this to get my point across.
Do I really have to use capital letters in an attempt to convey the
point?
