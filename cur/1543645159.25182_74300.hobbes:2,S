What we want to know is: does it crash with no NVdriver involved from
boot. Thats the one thing that says 'Maybe the Linux kernel has a
problem' and means people can hunt it down
I'd still start with the hw tests first just because of the description
you give. However if they seem ok and it wont crash without the NVdriver
loaded - talk to Nvidia not us 8)
