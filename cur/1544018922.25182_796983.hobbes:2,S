Hi Dave, Roland,
I'm submitting 2 patches against cxgb3 and iw_cxgb3 respectively.
They are built against net-next-2.6.
The first patch adds a notification mechanism to cxgb3 to alert
the upper layer drivers (iWARP and iSCSI) of a chip reset.
The second patch adds the handler for such an event in the iWARP driver.
Since the second patch depends on the first one, I submit them together,
even though the second patch should be submitted against Roland's tree.
Cheers,
Divy
