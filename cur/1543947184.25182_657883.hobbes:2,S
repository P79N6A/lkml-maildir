I understand what you say Andi, but nothing in the kernel stops us from
supporting 64GB. Should a framework like memory controller make an assumption
that not more than 16GB will be configured on an x86 box?

I see two problems with using vmalloc. One, the reservation needs to be done
across architectures. Two, a big vmalloc chunk is not node aware, if all the
pages come from the same node, we have a penalty to pay in a NUMA system.
