   However writing a test server that stand in blocking wait on a UDP
   socket, and start two instances of the server it's ALWAYS the server
   last started that get the udp message, even if it's not in blocking
   wait, and the first started server is. 
   Smells like a bug to me, this behavior don't make much sence. 
   Using stock 2.4.17.
Can you post your test server/client application so that I
don't have to write it myself and guess how you did things?
Thanks.
