No chroot(2) needed, just a chdir(2) to make your point. And as always,
permissions are checked when they are used (i.e., to go into /dir1/dir2,
they are checked at _that_ point in time). If they are changed later
doesn't matter. A bit surprising perhaps, but the only sane (and efficient)
way of doing business.
