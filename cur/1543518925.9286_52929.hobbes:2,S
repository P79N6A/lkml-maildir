Subject: Filesystem corruption on i686 with 2.3.x kernels?

I'm seeing this here (2.3.20 up to 2.3.31pre1 with jumps between), enough
to scare me from using 2.3 at all. Strangely, 2.3.20 ran for quite some
time with a very similar configuration on a plain Pentium without eating
any filesystems. Recently several people posted their .config files (for
unrelated reasons), and _noone_ was running a kernel configured for
i686. Coincidence?
