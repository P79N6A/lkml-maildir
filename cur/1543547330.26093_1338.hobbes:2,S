Hello
Patch vs pre1 but also applies vs pre2:
    
http://www.hojdpunkten.ac.se/054/samba/smbfs-2.2.18-pre1.patch.gz
Changes are mostly from 2.4.0-test7:
        * proc.c: add back lanman2 support (OS/2 and others)
        * proc.c: check length of paths to avoid buffer overflow
        * proc.c: don't do interruptable_sleep in smb_retry to avoid signal
          problem/race.
        * proc.c: O_RDONLY & smb_revalidate_inode fix (tail -f)
        * proc.c: add nls support
        * sock.c: attempt to fix smb_data_callback (avoid infinite loop)
The lanman2 is a partial undo of some changes made for 2.2.16 that caused
problems for OS/2 users.
"attempt to fix" should perhaps now be "appears to fix". A problem with
lockups (infinite loop with BKL held?) that appears to go away. But the
debug outputs haven't told us why. Doing while(1) after a lock_kernel()
seems dangerous anyway.
