oh, barf.  why does this always happen to me? :-)  i just verified
that a patch i threw together to rid the tree of NORET_TYPE does in
fact (and not surprisingly) produce *exactly* the same 7000+ lines of
output and, based on what we've established so far, that's exactly
what it should have done.
at this point, i'd prefer to submit that patch as is for a couple
reasons.  first, it's a no-brainer if all it does is remove every
reference to NORET_TYPE and leave everything else untouched.  if i go
beyond that, then i'm starting to make judgment calls and possibly
changing the logic, which makes this a totally different cleanup job.
also, in a number of cases, there are some routines that are qualified
with *both* NORET_TYPE and ATTRIB_NORET, suggesting that some
developers knew very well what the difference was, and i was going to
deal with all that ATTRIB_NORET nonsense in another pass.
in short, i'd rather keep this as an aesthetic, no-op kind of cleanup,
otherwise, i just *know* things are going to get ugly.  the final
patch will follow shortly.
