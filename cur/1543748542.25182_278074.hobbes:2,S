I have begun to implement it this but the problem I have now is that
this setup makes tpm_atmel and tpm_nsc dependent on tpm.  Since tpm
calls pci_register_driver in its init (which has to happen before
tpm_<specific> init) probe is called before the "interfaces" are
registered and thus the tpm_probe fails to find the device.  Do I move
the pci_register?  If so what is the proper place to register it? When
one interface registers?  If so then I think devices for the second and
subsequent interfaces would never be discovered for the same reason as I
am currently experiencing.  Do I need to move the current tpm probe
logic to the hw specific drivers?
Thanks,
Kylene
