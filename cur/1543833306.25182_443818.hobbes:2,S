To be fair, the older, "base" numbers are actually stable, such as
what glibc is depending on, have in practice been quite stable.  It's
only the newer fields that tend to be unstable.
But that means we can afford to do an orderly migration away from it;
it's not something that has to be urgently done within a few weeks or
even a few months.
