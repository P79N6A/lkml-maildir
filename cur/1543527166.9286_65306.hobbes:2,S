The speed trade-off is directly related to the predictability of the
branch(es).  A branch which goes rlrlrlrlrlrlrlr will, under most schemes in
use, be mispredicted either 50 or 100% of the time. rrllrrllrrllrrllrrll is
another really bad sequence.
A REALLY good optimizer might take the lazy-branch version of the code,
recognize that the later tests are side effect-free, and chose the version
is thinks is better.  Problem is, such a compiler would likely be helpless
attempting to recognize an alternating branch point such as above.
Each mispredict will cost you several clocks, depending on the processor.  
Each processor has its own prediction scheme.
Which gets us to a Dykstra quote, "Programming is, by definition, what you
have to tell the computer to do."

I'm right when I say "The rules have changed.  Consider bit-logicals.  Time
your critical inner loops".  It all depends on the exact details of the code
& the processor.  When c, d, e, and f are simple variables and the first two
branches are hard to predict, bit-ors should be faster on all the latest
superscalar systems.
