Is it just me or is "make modules" broken.
After doing a make modules there is no modules directory, no modules nothing
(and yes I have some drivers, notably aic, setup to be modules)
Pre-6 was ok
Pre-8 was broken
Pre-9 broken
If I have missed an announcement - put egg on my face and point me in the
right direction please
Andrew
