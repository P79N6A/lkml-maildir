Where were you when I was writing this stuff :).  I agree with most all of it, 
save the following:

As I understand it modern machines, the indirect call does really bad things to 
the pipeline.  The default call, even preceeded by the if, will be much faster 
by this reasoning.  I would, therefor, prefer not defining CLOCK_DISPATCH_DIRECT.
