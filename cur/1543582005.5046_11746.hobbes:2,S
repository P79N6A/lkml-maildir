Hi,
I have had occasional freezes (complete NumLock won't work) for some time.
I blamed HW, irq conflicts, temperature problems, ...
But suddenly with 2.4.2-pre1 the problems disappeared!
Since 2.4.2-pre1 was rather short I took the time to try to find out what 
could be the fix.
I found one candidate, the setting of  TASK_RUNNING in handle_mm_fault.
Since the problem had appeared on both 2.4 and 2.2.18 I started to try to 
reproduce the problem in an unpatched 2.2 - it took some time, got the freeze
today.
During this time I have tried to collect information of the freezes on KDE 
mailing lists - I do now have three additional reports (one running 2.2.17)
Hardware has varied.
I have now compiled and installed this patch but since it can't be proven
to fix the problem I submit it now.
