2.5.1-pre11+devfs-patch-v203
2.5.1-pre11 fails mounting the root fs during boot when
the short name of the root device is given to the loader,
for instance :
root=/dev/discs/disc0/part2
it succeeds only with the long name :
root=/dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part2
2.5.1-pre10 was happy with the short name.
It's not a big issue, one just have to know it.
