        Where did you see a new name? I specially mentioned that era of
new names are gone. We talk about device drivers and platform devices,
plain and straight. It's just a driver which does convenience
operations for a group of platform_devices, and sure, all these
convenience operations are well familiar to anyone in topic.
        How such drivers (SoC base ones) are still useful is also
pretty obvious: first of all, they are there, like mentioned sa1111.c
and locomo.c. This RFC just calls for recognition of them as a special
class of drivers, instead of keeping them hoard arch dirs.
        As for registering subdevices by SoC driver, it should be also
clear why that's useful: as was mentioned, we have 12 devices using
ASIC3 now. Instead of polluting machine definitions with duplicate
subdevices declarations, we declare a SoC chip devices in them, and
let chip driver declare subdevices, handling other boring tasks, as
resource munging, at the same time (like that bus_shift thing - some
ASIC3 devices has 2 byte register spacing, some 4 (essentially
attached to off-by-one address lines)).
