Not. Look at page 26-210, the '*'. About protected mode moves to
segment registers, of the Intel Rag., ISBN 1-55512-159-4, Intel 486
Programmer's reference manual. Also page 26-2, Table 26-1, Effective
size attributes.
	There is no movw in Intel syntax nor is there a movl.
In Intel, if the segment size (the D bit in the segment descriptor),
is set to 32 bits, every instruction that uses 16 bit registers requires
the address-size prefix because this is the only thing that shows
the processor the difference.
If a move to a segment register does not require a segment-override,
then the address-size prefix is not required. This saves an opcode.
	For instance,
	(Intel dest<-source) 32-bit operation.
	mov ds,eax	; Is allowed (no prefix generated)
	mov ds,ax	; Is allowed (prefix is generated)
	mov ds, cs:[foo] ; A prefix is generated and required.
	mov ds, [foo]	; A prefix is not generated nor required
	In all cases, only the low 16-bits are moved into the
	segment register. And, in protected mode, this must
	refer to a valid segment descriptor.
I'm sure Intel would like to hear from you if you have a devised
a better way to use their processors, or if you have discovered
that their documentation is wrong.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
