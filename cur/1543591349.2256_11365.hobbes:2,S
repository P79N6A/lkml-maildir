Haven't heard from him in a while. I've got a patch or two pending
as well, one of which modifies this code to check for 16c2850s.
Usually he just says he's really busy.

Are you using the serial console though? That seems to be
implied by your problem, but I just want to check.

Hm. I didn't really read the comment, since I know what the
code is doing. :-) I can send you an 864 sheet if you'd like;
we most likely have the other 85x sheets around somewhere;
all pdf format.
