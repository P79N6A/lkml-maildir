I've just skimmed through the code in Configure to
see if there is a way to make it shut up and just
default everything new to NO so I can use it inside
a noninteractive script.
Did I miss it or is it something that isn't there
to be found?
I think I'd not be the only one to find it useful
to make it be seen and not heard during a 
make oldconfig :-)
