Hi Andrew,
I just tried 2.4.16 with and without your patch.
During the
test, I wrote a 640 MB file on an IDE disk at an
average
speed of 10 MB/s. Without your patch, I could easily
reproduce the slugginess other people report, mostly
at
the login prompt. But when I applied your patch, I can
log in
immediately, so yes, I can say that your patch
improves
things dramatically.
I can't say yet if there are side effects, but I keep
testing.
Regards,
Willy
