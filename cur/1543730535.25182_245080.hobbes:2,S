Hmm.. Why exactly does the PCI layer re-locate the IO ports?
Afaik, ACPI requesting the region shouldn't matter. The 
"request_resource()" should still be happy..
Ahh. I see the problem. Because the ACPI code allocates the sub-resources, 
the request_resource thing is indeed not happy.
How about this _trivial_ change? Does that fix things for you guys? Can 
you send the /proc/ioport output if this works out for you, just so that 
we can see?
(The difference between "request_resource()" and "insert_resource()" is 
that the latter accepts pre-existing sub-resources that the firmware might 
have allocated within the resource we have..)
