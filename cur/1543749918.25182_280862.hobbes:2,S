I'm pretty sure I do use libata, because /dev/sda is present, and I
see libata in 'lsmod' output.
I was wrong in my previous post. /dev/sda has dma enabled indeed, like
you said. I get this error only when I try to set dma on /dev/hda
disk.
I took vanilla 2.6.9 from kernel.org, compiled in nearly everything I
could just relate to IDE/ATA thing - no luck. I then took 2.6.10.rc3
and got the same result.
What am I missing here?
Please help,
Ed.
