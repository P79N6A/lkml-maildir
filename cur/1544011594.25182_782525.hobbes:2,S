I haven't, although I haven't sat down to implement it yet.

Well, driver modules should be being loaded by udev.  Period.  If  
something requires a manual modprobe, that's a bug IMHO.  The other  
stuff, while non-trivial, is surprisingly doable from udev rules.

I think that once you start getting into this realm, though, you end  
up with an incredibly over-complicated and slow initramfs.  If we  
instead focus on keeping things "fast", the reboot afterwards isn't  
that costly.

Yeah, Dave and I have talked a fair bit about that.  It's just  
significantly easier to get something going _outside_ of the kernel  
sources and then work towards integrating it.  The plus side of  
integrating it is that the existing bits to generate a built-in  
initramfs can go away.
