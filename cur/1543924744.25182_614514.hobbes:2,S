The first 2.6.24-rc1-git-kernel that I patched with your patches did
not boot for me. (Oops send in one of my previous mails) But given
that the stacktrace was not xfs related and I had seen this patch on
the lkml, I tried to fix this Oops this way.
I did not have troubles with the RAID5 otherwise.

Will do this this evening.

Already tried that: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/2/178
See the logs from the second unmerge in the second half of the mail.
The sync did not stop this writeout, but returned immediately.

Yes, I completly agree that this is much to long. Thats why I included
the after-emerge-finished parts of the logs. But I still partly
suspect xfs, because the xfssyncd shows up when I hip SysRq+W.

I don't think its the block device, because reading/writing larger
files do not seem to be troubled. It looks much more like an inode
problem. For example both installing and uninstalling kernel source
trees show these stalls, but during uninstalling this is much more
noticeable.
But I agree that this might not be xfs specific, as this showed up at
the same time as other people started reporting about the 100% iowait
bug. Could be that this is the same bug and the differences between
reiserfs and xfs might explain the iowait vs. idle. Or that I don't
see the 100% iowait is something else on my system...
