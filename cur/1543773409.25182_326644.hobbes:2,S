udev is a great thing is you are putting out a distribution which will 
be used on many configurations. That doesn't include most of us.

One size doesn't fit all with that, it's nice to have hardware that the 
kernel doesn't try to use, particularly if it's hardware that the kernel 
almost but not quite knows HOW to use...
In other words, there are reasons for running static /dev, although I 
suggest trimming it to something resembling what you need.
RELATED TOPIC: It would be really nice of the changelog started with a 
"REQUIRED UPDATES" section, even though the vast majority of cases the 
description would be "none." Seeing that git didn't even provide a full 
Changelog in the previous tradition, I guess that's not likely.
