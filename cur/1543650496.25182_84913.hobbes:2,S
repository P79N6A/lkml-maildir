We have the hwif structures (ugly I know) which know what the interface
is nailed to and what is nailed to each device so it isnt that bad.
There are the odd complications of course - chips that appear as two PCI
devices and either one of them turns off both for example 8)

It is cleaner if the ordering of power off is right. If the model is
right then the first suspend would be the drives. Part of drive suspend
ought to be corking the queue.
