In that case they can contain the firmware and mark it __init.
They need no RAM. They can even mark the code needed to put
firmware into the device as __init.

How and what is the benefit? If you go low on battery you have to suspend,
there's no choice. This means that you have to have it in RAM always.

In this form unworkable. Removing a module could kill the machine.
That scheme requires that drivers formally register and unregister
with fwfs and provide module pointers.
An awful lot of overhead.

No, it isn't. These writes must require CAP_HARDWARE, thus

No, you must not wait for user space.

Sorry.
