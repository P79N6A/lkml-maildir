Will GCC know that it needs to emit code to handle that (mis)alignment?
Preliminary tests show that it does load the value bytewise if we use
the 'packed' attribute structure on ppc64, but doesn't if we use
compat_u64. But then, I don't think it actually _needs_ to handle it n
ppc64 anyway, so maybe that's not such a good test.
I'll send a simple patch to fix the bug for now, just making the new
wrapper conditional on X86_64||IA64.
