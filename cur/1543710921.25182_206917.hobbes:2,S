The driver doesn't claim to have found any device. It just registered
to the EISA framework, which you compiled in for a reason.
Unload the driver and the directory will go.

Sure. When EISA bus is hanging off the PCI bus, which haven't been
probed yet ? When the driver registers, the EISA framework may not
have a f*cking clue about where the EISA bus sits, or if it even
exists.

Feel free to submit a patch. One that works for x86, Alpha, HPPA and
IP22, with EISA connected to PCI, GSC, GIO or CPU bus. It works nicely
enough for me on these platforms.
