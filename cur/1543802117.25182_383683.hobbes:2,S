No worries... and no offence taken! In a sense we are still exploring
possible/desirable workflows and what the missing pieces are. And yes,
some thing don't quite make sense from the outside, perhaps because
they just don't or because we arent' explaining them very well.
In a sense, we do have a bit of a challenge explaining what how all
the parts fit together, even to bk old timers it seems.

As long as you've got enough tools to use a workflow that fits you,
it's all good.
