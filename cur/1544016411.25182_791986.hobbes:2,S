  Yes. And also add a flush in case of fdatasync().

  Well, I thought that a barrier, as an abstraction, only guarantees that
any IO which happened before the barrier hits the iron before any IO which
has been submitted after a barrier. This is actually enough for a
journalling to work correctly but it's not enough for fsync() guarantees.
But I might be wrong...
