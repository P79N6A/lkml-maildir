This looks like a rather expensive operation for the unlikely case
that packets will be received by a packet socket. IMO it should only
be reconstructed if actually needed, by af_packet itself.
As we discussed some time back storing the VLAN tag in the CB on
TX clashes with other users of the CB like qdiscs, so we need a
new field in the skb for this anyway.
