Yes, that's very important.  There was a long-standing security bug in
*BSD's where you could open("/dev/whatever", 0) with no permission on
the inode and then do ioctl()s at it.  Under linux, you're only allowed
to create these special file handles if you have complete permission to
open the file.  It's counter-intuitive, but correct.
