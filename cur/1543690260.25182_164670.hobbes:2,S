We do not know which of these is going to happen, it is entirely up to
the BIOS writers and the BIOS configuration ... i.e. on my laptop, I
have two suspend buttons - one for suspend to ram, one for suspend to disk,
but under APM the kernel merely gets a SUSPEND event no matter which
button I press.
However, there is APM standby
On another note, APM does allow for individual device power management
(i.e. you can tell the BIOS "suspend the first disk" or "power off
all displays").  I have been wondering if we want to disable the BIOS's
device power management now that we are begining to do it ourselves.
