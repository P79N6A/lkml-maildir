Is the below idea feasible or just stupid:
Once a level-sensitive interrupt has been accepted by a local APIC, the IO
APIC will wait for the EIO message prior to delivering again this
interrupt. Therefore masking a level-sensitive interrupt once it has been
delivered and prior to EIOing it should not race with the APIC hardware.
So, why not using a pure software flag in memory and only tampering the
things if the offending interrupt is actually delivered ? If the given
interrupt is delivered and the software mask is set we could simply do:
- MASK the given interrupt
- EOI it.
- return
