I don't think many DVD burners support MRW. At least that's the impression
I got from reading a lot of drive reviews. It's a strange thing because
most combo drives seem to support it. AFAIK the DVD+MRW standard is quite
new so that would explain part of it but I'm still wondering why the
drives wouldn't support CD-MRW.
