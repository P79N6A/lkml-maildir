If killing an noisy printk is not an trivial patch, I do not know what
else is. If you want me to keep some printks, tell me, and we can talk
about that.

Yes, and just now you are contributing for swsusp to stay in the messy
state. Thanx a lot.
If you want to become swsusp maintainer, say so, and you'll be fed
nice and split patches *once*. That's okay to do. But I'm not able/do
not have enough time to produce split patch each time Linus decides to
drop the mail into the bitbucket.
I really don't like "Linus dropped patch -> resubmit 2 patches merged"
resulting in you screaming "SPLIT IT UP!" on the lists.
