The objects (kobjects) are now separate from the sysfs core internals,
so this should all be fixed up now :)
Anyway, sysfs is (hopefully) different from this filesystem, it should
be able to be done using all of the ramfs code, and no "special" backing
logic would be needed.  Like usbfs...
And if you see problems in the usbfs implementation with regards to
lifetime rules (becides the devices file), please let me know.
