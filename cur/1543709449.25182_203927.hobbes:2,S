In the vast majority of cases the application was already racy.  It took
davem a very long time to convince me that this was really a bug ;)

Well first people need to understand the problem and convince themselves
that this really is a bug.  And yes, there are surely other ways of fixing
it up.  One might be to put some sequence counter in the mm_struct and
rerun the mprotect if it detects that someone else snuck in with a
usercopy.  Or add an rwsem to the mm_struct, take it for writing in
mprotect.
