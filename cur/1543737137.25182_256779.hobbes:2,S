This has to stay the way it currently is because of the stealth mode code

doc people don't want to switch

ran most of it through Lindent. check out CVS for results.

There are about 20 open coded lists. I started to fix some of these
but the code involved can be touchy and it's already well tested.
It would be better to wait on these until someone is working on
the code involved. I don't want to introduce bugs because I don't
understand the code 100%.

Changed these to use kernel defaults.

That can probably be fixed. I believe it is because it is hiding a
2.4/2.6 change.

I started to do this to but I didn't want to disrupt know working code. These
may get rewritten for sysfs.
