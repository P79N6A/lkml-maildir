Subject: [PATCH 0/7] AMD Geode GX/LX support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/3/183

The following seven patches add support for the AMD Geode GX and LX
processors, as well as some drivers and fixes for various components within
the processors or the CS5535/CS5536 companion chips.
Two of the patches are IDE related, so I'll only CC the linux-ide list for
those to keep traffic down (please don't be confused by the numbering).
Please CC back to the info-linux@ldcmail.amd.com mailing list so all of
our developers can participate in the discussion.
