This has been said many times, and I have never been able to translate
it into anything other than "pathname access control is bad".
Pathname-based access control systems, among other things, let you write
a policy that says "you may create files under /foo/bar/baz". So when
you attempt to create a file "/foo/bar/baz/biff" the LSM needs to know
which VFS mount you are creating it in.
Multiple mount points, bind mounts, and other fun with mounting, do in
fact allow you to create aliases. Because of that, an LSM that set a
policy of "you can create files anywhere *except* /foo/bar/baz" would be
trivially bypassable. But a policy that says "You may *only* create
files under /foo/bar/baz" (plus whatever other explicit permissions it
grants) does not seem to create any problems, so long as the confined
processes are not permitted to create arbitrary aliases by using fun
with mount.
So just exactly what is dangerous about this?
Caveat: complaints that you can create a policy that is bypassable are
not interesting, you can do that with any policy system. To show
"dangerous" you would have to show how a reasonable policy that should
be secure is in fact bypassable. This threat from mount point aliases,
this has often been conjectured but has never been shown.
