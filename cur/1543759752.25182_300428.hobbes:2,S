Fortunately this one seems to be a simple locking violation, nothing
subtle in the jbd layers.

I'm assuming that's the line
			J_ASSERT_JH(jh, jh->b_next_transaction == NULL);
in the t_forget loop.  That's not one of the most common footprints I
saw due to this bug, but it's certainly a possible one.  We saw one case
where a bh from the wrong transaction was linked onto the j_locked_list,
due to it being freed then reused while in use; and if that can happen,
pretty much anything can go wrong afterwards!
