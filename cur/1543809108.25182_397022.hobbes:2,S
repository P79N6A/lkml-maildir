Dominik maintains the pcmcia development tree, and these are
pcmcia drivers...

pcmcia patches should preferably go via the pcmcia development tree, and
get integrated and reviewed by the maintainer and all that good stuff.
So it wouldn't go via -mm at all - pcmcia only goes into -mm for testing.
The more specific point is that your patch conflicted with Dominik's
current development tree in a big way.   That needs to get sorted out.
