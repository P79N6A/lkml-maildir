Your kernel thread is probably sharing filedescriptors with the parent 
process, so although your application closes its copy, because the kernel 
thread hasn't closed its copy, the ->release() method never gets called.
Make sure you're cleaning up properly when starting the kernel thread. See 
how other kernel threads do it. As Andi says, daemonize() is a good start, 
although it's not always sufficient.
