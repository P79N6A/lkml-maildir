I have a better things with 2.6.24-rc3 ;)
# cd /proc/net
# ls ..
ls: reading directory ..: Not a directory
and this
# cd /proc
# find
...
./net
find: . changed during execution of find
# find net
find: net changed during execution of find
# find net/
<this works ok however>
Moreover. Program that opens /proc/net and dumps the /proc/self/fd
files produces the following:
# cd /
# a.out /proc/net
...
lr-x------  1 root root 64 Nov 20 18:02 3 -> /proc/net/net (deleted)
...
# cd /proc/net
# a.out .
...
lr-x------  1 root root 64 Nov 20 18:03 3 -> /proc/net/net (deleted)
...
# a.out ..
...
lr-x------  1 root root 64 Nov 20 18:03 3 -> /proc/net
...
This all is somehow related to the shadow proc files.
E.g. the first problem (with -ENOTDIR) is due to the shadow /proc/net
dentry doesn't implement the .readdir method:
static const struct file_operations proc_net_dir_operations = {
        .read                   = generic_read_dir,
};
And I haven't managed to find out why the rest problems
occur...
Eric, do you have fixes for it?
