I find the 2.6.15-git6 i386 CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=y doesn't work unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES=y, because of the __mutex_fastpath jumps to fail_fn
(giving two pushes of %ebp to one pop).  Whereas x86_64 __mutex_fastpaths
use calls and work with FRAME_POINTER=y.  Whether i386 deserves asm mods
rather than Kconfigery to force one from other, I've no strong instinct.
