Another datapoint, I've a Cyrix 6x86 running contigniously for 12 days
now, and its never idle. (Running rc5des /and/ framegrabbing a image
from my outside camera every 30 seconds) The reason is only ran for
12 days was because 2.2.10 came out and I (ofcourse) needed to upgrade.
RH6.0; MTRR;BIGPHYSAREA;IPV6; egcs-1.1.2 compiled.
