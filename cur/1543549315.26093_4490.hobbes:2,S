Well the code does a fnsave. Somebody never looked at the damn book! it
takes 143 clocks for this, plus at least 3 for fwait.  Then it sets a
flag to let return code 'know' if the context has to be restored. This
code `exists` sort of like moss. I don't think it is ever executed and
if it is, you get to keep both broken pieces.
If you are going to use floating-point, you __must__ save and restore
the state of the FP unit for every context-switch. With multiple CPUs,
you have to save/restore the state of the right CPU. etc.
And for what?
So someone can do something stupid and put floating-point in the kernel.
Floating-point is used for mathematics on fractional real numbers.
There aren't any in the kernel. If you need fractional parts, which
is most unlikely in a binary operated device, then you must express
them as the ratio of two integers. Which, I will point out, is often a
much more accurate way of handling numbers. 1/3 is denoted exactly.
0.333333......  will never be.
