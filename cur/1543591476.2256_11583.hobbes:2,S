Aunt Tillie doesn't even know what a kernel is, nor does she want to. I
think 
it's fair to assume that people who configure and compile their own
kernel 
(as opposed to using the distribution supplied ones) know what they are
doing.
Or at least make something like a "Expert level" question as first
question, so 
that people who DO know what they are doing can select the options they
want.
Going from "make config" (which has a scary interface for novice users,
agreed)
to "vi" is NOT progress.
