Nobody's done that yet, and it's been a couple years now since that point
was made as a desirable evolution path for pci_pool.  In fact the first
(only!) step on that path was the dma_pool update I just posted.
Modifying the slab allocator like that means passing extra parameters around
(for dma_addr_t), causing extra register pressure even for non-dma allocations.
I have a hard time seeing that not slow things down, even on x86 (etc) where
we know we can already get all the benefits of the slab allocator without any
changes to that critical code.

Yes:  not all drivers need (or want) such a memory-reservation layer.

I'd say instead that drivers which happen to need the protection against
failures that mempool provides can safely layer that behavior on top of
any allocator they want.  (Modulo that buglet, which requires them to be
layered on top of kmalloc.)
Which means that the mempool discussion is just a detour, it's not an
implementation tool for any kind of dma_pool but is instead an option
for drivers (in block i/o paths) to use on top of a dma_pool allocator.
