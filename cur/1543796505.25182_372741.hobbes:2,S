You are running an ancient kernel (with possible security issues) and unless you have some paid support for it I doubt you will get serious help here.
Your choices are to upgrade to latest 2.4 series version 2.4.32 and hope that the problem goes away or upgrade to the latest 2.6 series and then repost if a similar problem occurs there.
Also, if the problem started happening recently and without any kernel related changes, you might want to test the hardware.
