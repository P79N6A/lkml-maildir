Also, at one time, people used to spend a lot of time
minimizing the number of CPU cycles used in the code.
For instance, when it's appropriate, using XOR makes the
resulting generated code simpler and usually faster:
int funct0(int i)
{
     return i ^ 1;
}
int funct1(int i)
{
     return (i != 1);
}
int main()
{
     int i;
     for(i=0; i< 100; i++)
     {
         if(funct0(i))
             printf("Yep %d\n", i);
         if(funct1(i))
             printf("Yep %d\n", i);
     }
     return 0;
}
gcc -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer ...
Here, funct0 clearly uses less code.
Disassembly of section .text:
00000000 <funct0>:
    0:	8b 44 24 04          	mov    0x4(%esp),%eax
    4:	83 f0 01             	xor    $0x1,%eax
    7:	c3                   	ret
00000008 <funct1>:
    8:	31 c0                	xor    %eax,%eax
    a:	83 7c 24 04 01       	cmpl   $0x1,0x4(%esp)
    f:	0f 95 c0             	setne  %al
   12:	c3                   	ret
   13:	90                   	nop
00000014 <main>:
[SNIPPED...]
