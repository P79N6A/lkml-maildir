Your observation was correct.
LMbench tests Interprocess communication using pipes and sockets.
Mingming Cao's IPC lock patch was not touched by LMbench.
The reason for the performance gain when applying the patch is not
yet clear and under investigation. I will share my analysis once it
is completed. I do realize that there is a variance in the data
generated by LMbench.
