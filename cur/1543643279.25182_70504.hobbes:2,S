                                 make sure testing and general user are killed
                                 BEFORE production

I like this. Maybe map it to user gid and provide /proc interface?
Let's say on your server you allocated gids this way:
0   -   system
100 -   support
110 -   payroll
120 -   production
200 -  general user
130 -   production background
500 - testing
# echo "0 100 110 120 200 130 500" >/proc/resourceprio
# echo "0 100 110 120 130 200 500" >/proc/killprio
