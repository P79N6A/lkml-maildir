Roger,
Thanks for the programme Roger!
I'm not sure if I did this right but.....
I ran the programme as follows: (I called it sandisktest :)
# ./sandisktest -b | dd of=/dev/hdc
then I dd'd the image of the flash disk to my local disk and viewed the file 
through midnight commander.
What I have found is that just after the start of a sector, usually 43 to 45 
bytes, 6 bytes are skipped and the sequence starts again.  This continues 
until the next sector starts, where the sequence corrects.  This appears to 
happen every 65536 bytes or some multiple of 65536.  It may skip three blocks 
of 65536 and then corrupt on the next block of 65536 bytes.
I would greatly appreciate some other ideas to try, I'm not game to start 
hacking the kernel code quite yet :)
Paul.
BTW:  I also tried a EXT2 FS and it corrupted files just as the FAT16 
filesystem had.
