Amusing misunderstanding.  Take a look at kmap_atomic_to_page
in arch/i386/mm/highmem.c: it doesn't _do_ a kmap_atomic, it
translates the virtual address already supplied by kmap_atomic
to the address of the struct page of the physical page backing
that virtual address.  So, in the case of try_to_unmap_one, it
operates on the virtual address supplied by rmap_ptep_map
(which does do a kmap_atomic), and at the end there's an
rmap_ptep_unmap (which does the rmap_ptep_unmap).
