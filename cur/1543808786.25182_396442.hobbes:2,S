Hi,
I've recently been experimenting with S3 suspend on my Athlon 64 X2 3800+ 
system, on an nForce4 SLI CK804 mainboard. My machine will suspend-to-mem 
with the command:
echo mem >> /sys/power/state
And when I press the pwr button, it resumes correctly, even back into X11. 
However, things freeze shortly after.
I tracked down the problem to my SATA controller not being reinitialised 
properly on resume. I get an ata timeout message (which I apologise for not 
having handy, but the machine has no serial ports and vesafb is garbled by 
the suspend. If you really need this message I can probably find a way to get 
it).
I'm reporting this because I notice on the Jeff's Linux SATA status page, 
sata_nv is listed as having "full PM". Find my config and dmesg from a 
successful boot at:

http://devzero.co.uk/~alistair/oops-20060213/dmesg
Ignore the directory title, I'm recycling these files from reporting a cpu 
hotplug oops last night.

Cheers,
Alistair.
