No - I am tainting with NVIDIA unfortunately. I was trying to find the time to 
diagnose sans NVIDIA when Anton reported the same leak (turns out he has the 
same Asus P5GDC-V Deluxe board), only in his dmesg he is not tainting at all.
We did determine that Anton and I both use the Marvell sk98lin patch for our 
Yukon2s. However, Anton reported other servers using this patch with no leak. 
Ariel - are you using sk98lin? The only other modules I'm using are the ALSA 
modules for snd-hda-intel as of ALSA version 1.0.11-rc2.
Cheers,
Chase
