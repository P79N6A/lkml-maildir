Interesting, but confusing.
The filehandle of the directory seems to keep changing.  Maybe tcpdump
is showing too many bytes.  Access to the raw dump would help.

'access' should never return 'Permission denied' so there is
definitely something wrong here.  I was expected nfserr_acces rather
than nfserr_perm...
The server logs at the same time would help a lot.
