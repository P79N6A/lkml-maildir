Beginning with Squid 2.STABLE, the default squid configuration file denys access
to all connections, except I believe the Redhat distribution which accepts from
localhost.

Yeah, it was just an observation of Squid's abilities. Squid itself was created
to serve out static pages from it's cache, but this leads to another question..
Why create a specific server in kernel mode designed to serve out static files
to a TCP socket when so many things other than web servers would improve from
this? FTP servers, News servers, Mail servers, etc would all benefit from an
increase in speed.
Wouldn't it be better to generalize khttpd into a series of syscalls userland
servers can use to dish out static files at maximum speed and efficiency?
