Hi Wittman,
How goes the ATA/SCSI chip business?
Did the SCSI drivers you sent me for your products get added?
I hope that AC got them since I had not heard back.
However, I am not an expert on the INITRD process of floppy module disk
installs.
Is there anyone here on LK that can help me help a HOST controller vendor
that is very friendly to Linux based in Taiwan.
If you can help, do so online.
I would like to learn something new, too.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
