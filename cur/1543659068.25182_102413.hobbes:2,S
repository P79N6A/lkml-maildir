I talked to him in person last week, and this was one of the topics of
discussion.  He seemed to think it was fundamentally unfixable.  He
proceed to explain why, and then explained the scheme he worked out to
improve things.  Unfortunately my memory cannot do justice to the
details.
Next time he explains it, I will write it down :)
Sorry for so lame a data point :)
