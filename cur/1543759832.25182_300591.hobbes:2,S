The patch i propose is tiny, simple and straight forward. It
touches only one file and leaves the CSA code in a  configurable
loadable module. It broke nobody's code and it does not need to
redesign existing BSD kernel code and utilities.
If we are to merge the code, there are some detailed discussion
needed to happen on implementation deail. We are talking about
supporting two different internal formats by one piece of code.
We need to maintain BSD acct format because BSD utilities count
on it.
If we are to combine two formats into one, we then need to
modify BSD utilies to understand the new format. How about
the backwards compatibility?
Now this is really an overkill. All i asked for was only
adding a few lines to acct.c.
Thanks,
