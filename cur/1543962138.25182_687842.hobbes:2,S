Maybe your organization's http proxy will let you
tunnel the git protocol through it?
GIT_PROXY_COMMAND as described in 
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/git/0605/20509.html
works for me, except I substitue "nc" for "socket" in the
proxy script.
I.e.:
export GIT_PROXY_COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/proxy-cmd.sh
where proxy-cmd.sh is:
#! /bin/bash
(echo "CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.0"; echo; cat ) | \
    nc my.proxy.com proxy_port | (read a; read a; cat )
In .git/config there's also
gitproxy = /usr/local/bin/proxy-cmd.sh
