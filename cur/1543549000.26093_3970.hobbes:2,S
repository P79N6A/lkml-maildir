You know what?
Start your own kernel (or split one off from Linux - that's what the GPL
is all about), and we'll see where you are in ten years. If kernel
debuggers are so much better, then you'll be quite well off, and you can
prove your silly opinions by _showing_ them right.
In the meantime, I've shown what my opinions are worth. Take a look, any
day. Available at your nearest ftp-site.
Talk is cheap. If you want to convince me, do the WORK.
