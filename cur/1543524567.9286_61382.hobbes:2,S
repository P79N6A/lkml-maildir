You've only invalidated a cache line, which is still bad, but not fatal.
Applications like rendering don't often need shared write access to
anything because they can be set up to be working on different strips of
an image. There are many problems that can be made to look like lots of
separate smaller problems if looked at from the right angle, and many
graphics tasks fall into that category. The ones that aren't tend to be
things like inverting large matrices and aren't very friendly to caches,
let alone SMP.
