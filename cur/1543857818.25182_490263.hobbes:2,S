Yes.  The PTI is a useful vehicle for experimentation with page tables.
The PTI has two components.  The first component provides for architectural
and implementation independent page table access.  The second component
provides for architecture dependendent access, but I have only done this 
for IA64.  However, abstracting out the page table implementation for the 
arch dependent stuff on x86 would enable experimentation with
implementing linear page table mappings for x86, while leaving
the current implementation in place as an alternative page table.
