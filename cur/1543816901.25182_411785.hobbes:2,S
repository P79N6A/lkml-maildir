This morning I got a not-so-complete hang, that is, a sysrq-b key
combination surprisingly rebooted the machine!
So I tried again and managed to get it to hang, and captured a sysrq-T
trace of all running programs through a serial console link, which I
attach to this email (including the boot process that led to it). This
is running 2.6.15.7 + 2.6.15-rt21 + small fix you sent a few days ago on
an Athlon X2. I was logged in running evolution, mozilla and downloading
some iso images with bittorrent. 
Hopefully some clue will be found on what the heck is happening...
Thanks for all the help so far!
