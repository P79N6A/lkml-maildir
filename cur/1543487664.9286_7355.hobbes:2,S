Increasing both ring sizes to 256 had no significant impact for most
messages, but the number of messages spaced by 200 milliseconds shot up
to 30.  Prior to this test, the machines were rebooted and I believe
that they were completely dedicated to this test, so I have no
explanation for the 200 ms delays that were seen.  I'll repeat the test
using a crossover cable, but this made no difference in previous tests. 
With larger ring buffers, 70 messages were spaced by more than 1 ms, and
Andrea's patch did did not help much in those cases.  BTW, this test
measured 414,374 intermessage delays.
Sincerely,
Josip
