It might be interesting to have a more condensed CPU panel, something
like the OLS lightning talks. Gather a larger number of vendors, and give
each a small window to bring up the most relevant issues for them in the
future, while also allowing for some feedback and Q&A.
It would be nice to get more input from CPU architects, but only if it's
possible to keep it entirely technical and moving along without anyone
having to hurry their window of time due to someone else overstepping
theirs. If they only have a small window to present their concerns, I
think we'll see a lot of the fluff (as itemized by davej) go away.
As soon as a vendor starts rambling on about value-added IP blocks, we've
already lost..
