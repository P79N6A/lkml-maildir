Subject: [PATCH] Time to change NR_OPEN value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Time has come to change NR_OPEN value, some production servers hit the 
not so 'ridiculously high value' of 1024*1024 file descriptors per process.
AFAIK this is safe to raise this value, because alloc_fd_array() uses 
vmalloc() for large arrays and vmalloc() returns NULL  if a too large 
allocation is attempted (or in case of memory shortage)
