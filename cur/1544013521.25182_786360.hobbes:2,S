Yes, already done (not just moved things around) in case I wasn't clear.

Oh, I see. You mean the case when kmemtrace is compiled in but not
enabled. For slab_buffer_size() this is no problem, but things like
(1 << order) do result in more computation being performed. I'll fix it.
Heh, I sometimes wish C was more like Haskell (lazy, outer evaluation) :P.

I got that, but I'll try to keep any logic within slab code files. The
kmemtrace probe should call such a function to perform computation, so
developers won't ever need to look at mm/kmemtrace.c.

Hmm, probably having some get_req_size() & get_alloc_size() defined for
all slab allocators might make more sense. Just like we do now to handle
different kmalloc() variants.
I really feel like having to change both slab code and kmemtrace code to
support some new allocator isn't the way to go. Ideally, one should only
insert calls to probes and provide that get_*_size() interface.
I'll see what can be done. But please comment if you think otherwise.

Yes, it really is bogus, sorry. Will fix.
