I think we want to concentrate on the former, though I suspect the latter
will happen eventually. But let's keep our focus on providing a mechanism
for relaying large amounts of data from the kernel to user-space.

We already do write a heartbeat event periodically to have readable
traces in the case where the lower 32 bits of the TSC wrap-around.
As I mentioned elsewhere, please don't think of this in terms of
kbs or mbs of data. What we're talking about here is gbs if not
100gbs of data. Having to start reading each sub-buffer until you
hit a heartbeat really is a killer for such large traces. If there
was a significant impact on relayfs for having this I would have
understood the argument, but relayfs needs to do buffer-management
anyway, so I don't see that much complexity being added by allowing
the channel user to ask relayfs for delimiters.

As above, restoring the original order of events is fine if you are
looking at mbs or kbs of data. It's just totally unrealistic for
the amounts of data we want to handle.
But like I said earlier, the added relayfs mode (kdebug) would allow
for exactly what you are suggesting:
	event_id = atomic_inc_return(&event_cnt);
So here's the new API based on input from Christoph and Tom:
rchan* relay_open(channel_path, bufsize, nbufs);
int    relay_close(*rchan);
int    relay_reset(*rchan)
int    relay_write(*rchan, *data_ptr, count, **wrote-pos);
int    relay_info(*rchan, *channel_info)
void   relay_set_property(*rchan, property, value);
void   relay_get_property(*rchan, property, *value);
For direct writing (currently already used by ltt, for example):
char*  relay_reserve(*rchan, len, *ts, *td, *err, *interrupting)
void   relay_commit(*rchan, *from, len, reserve_code, interrupting);
void   relay_buffers_consumed(*rchan, u32)
These are the related macros:
#define relay_write_direct(DEST, SRC, SIZE) \
#define relay_lock_channel(RCHAN, FLAGS) \
#define relay_unlock_channel(RCHAN, FLAGS) \
What we are dropping for later review: read/write semantics from
user-space. It has to be understood that we believe that this is
a major drawback. For one thing, you won't be able to do something
like:
$ cat /relayfs/xchg/my-file > ~/test-data
Instead, you will have to write a custom app that does open(),
mmap(), write(). We could still provide a small app/library that
did this automagically, but you've got to admit that nothing
beats the real thing.
Also note that there are people who currently use this already,
so there will be some unhappy campers.
