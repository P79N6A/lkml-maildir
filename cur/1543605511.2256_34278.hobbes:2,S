I don't think it's true that there are alternative ISO standards,
otherwise the ISO standard (YYYY-MM-DD) wouldn't be a standard.
The standard applies only to _numerical_ dates, however.
This web page gives a summary:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html
Quotation from the page:
ISO 8601 is only specifying numeric notations and does not cover
dates and times where words are used in the representation. It is
not intended as a replacement for language-dependent worded date
notations such as "24. Dezember 2001" (German) or "February 4, 1995"
(US English).
When writing dates in English I like "4 February 2001" or
"4 Feb 2001" since it reads easily and still puts day, month, year
in a sane order.
I tried to look up the standard itself at the ISO website but
found that I would have to pay 104 Swiss Francs to download the
pdf file.

Hi Randy.

There is also another ISO standard (I forget the number) which states
that the international standard date notation is any of...
	DD.MM.YYYY	(European)
	MM/DD/YYYY	(American)
	YYYY-MM-DD	(Japanese)
...with the punctuation character specifying the one in use. I note that
the dates as originally quoted above are clearly consistant with this
standard, so see no problem myself.
Personally, I prefer to use the DD-MMM-YYYY format myself, where MMM in
the three-letter English abbreviation for the month in question, and
there is thus no room for misreading it as something else.

Best wishes from Riley.
