The standard ARM defconfig is next to useless anyway - most if not all
people will choose one of the other defconfig files in arch/arm/configs
first.
If someone wants to maintain the 46 ARM defconfigs, that's fine by me.
However, traditionally this has ended up producing stupidly massive
patches.
(I'm not saying its a bad thing - I'm just pointing out that keeping
them up to date will be a large job for someone.)
