i'm curious, which "recent trouble" do you refer to? (The NMI watchdog 
bug [which is off by default] was fixed quickly. The C1E bug was found 
and fixed quickly. Anything else i missed?)

i'd like to see the 64-bit clockevents (& dynticks) patches merged. 
Demand from users and distros is high: the 64-bit CE patches are merged 
into the Fedora 8 and Ubuntu kernels already, it's been in -mm and in 
-rt too for a long time and powertop users demand it as well. It also 
makes it obviously easier to unify the 64-bit and 32-bit code. So 
there's multiple good reasons to do it.
