Ah, yes.
The direct-io code will build requests which are larger than
the ips driver is prepared to accept, and the BIO layer correctly
BUGs out over it.
We need to convert direct-io to use the bio_add_page() facility
which Jens has recently added.
Until that's done you'll need to set BIO_MAX_PAGES to 16 in
include/linux/bio.h
