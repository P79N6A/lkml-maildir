i'm not familiar with linux usb implementation so may be it's wrong:
after sending global reset over the bus you can manually check (not 
trough the hub driver) root port connection status and call enumeration 
if needed.
another way- add an option to kernel for booting from usb mass-storage, 
where place an input-waiting code, because my current solution adds such 
delay for all boots (ide,scsi,usb)
