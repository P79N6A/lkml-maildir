Rusty,
What are the full set of patches that should be applied to take  
advantage of the latest module-init-tools?  There has been a lot of
traffic on lkml on modules with lots of little patches.  Its not at
all obvious just what needs be applied to 49/50.
Suspect that almost everything will once the correct patches are applied,
if we get the correct patches...
TIA
