I don't know, maybe.  My router is a fairly new model Cisco and is
pretty major (i.e. pretty expensive), so it's not just a total piece
of crap.  Plus, I never restart it when I see these issues.  I just
turn tcp_sack off, the problem goes away, and I'm able to renable
tcp_sack a few hours later and it works fine until many hours later
when I see the SYN_SENT problem again.
