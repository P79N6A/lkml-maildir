I am surprised that Reiser4 does so well, and I would be interested in
knowing more details of exactly what the test does.  Our tests show
reiser4 not doing THAT much better, so  you must be doing something
different from our tests. 
I learn from almost every benchmark done by other people, because they
almost always test differently from what I had imagined I should test.
