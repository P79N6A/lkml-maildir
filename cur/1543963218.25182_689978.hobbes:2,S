Andrea, you're *this* close to going to my list of people who it is not 
worth reading email from, and where it's better for everybody involved if 
I just teach my spam-filter about it.
That code was CRAP.
That code was crap whether it's used once, or whether it's used a million 
times. Stop making excuses for it just because it's not performance- 
critical.
So give it up already. I told you what the non-crap solution was. It's 
simpler, faster, and is about two lines of code compared to the crappy 
version (which was what - 200 lines of crap with a big comment on top of 
it just to explain the idiocy?).
So until you can understand the better solution, don't even bother 
emailing me, ok? Because the next email I get from you that shows the 
intelligence level of a gnat, I'll just give up and put you in a 
spam-filter.
Because my IQ goes down just from reading your mails. I can't afford to 
continue.
