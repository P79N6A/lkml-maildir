I'm running v2.2.3-ac1 and I too have gotten locked up tight.
I switched subfolders in Netscape Mail, this caused some disk
activity and then everything locked (almost) solid.
The HDD light remained lit constantly and was able to ctrl-alt-bksp
X-windows and that killed off all my windows but never returned me
to the console. after that everything seemed lock solid for real.
I had to hard reset my machine.
I don't have any IDE devices. I have a BusLogic BT-958 SCSI controller.
I haven't been able to replicate the error again so far but I will
try stressing the drives this afternoon and let you know if it happens
again.
