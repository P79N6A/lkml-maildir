And what if the server is Solaris? Same problem (at least in 2.2.10);
get "failed to monitor" messages and no programs that use flock() or
fcntl() will get their lock.  This is a real pain using MUA on NFS
mounted spool, and using dotlocking is rather silly don't you think?.

Isn't that a step backwards?
