There are two places that the subsystem create() function is called -
the first is during the subsystem registration, to create the
subsystem state for the root container. That one passes in dummytop
since that is the container that all subsystems start attached to.
For clarification, the default (dummy) hierarchy is a placeholder for
subsystems that aren't bound to a hierarchy. It always contains
exactly one container (dummytop) and all processes are members of that
container. It isn't reference-counted, since it can never go away, and
it can never have any subcontainers.
When a real subcontainer is created (which must be after a subsystem
has been bound to a hierarchy via a filesystem mount), the new
subcontainer is passed in. From there you can follow the top_container
field in the subcontainer, which leads to the root of the hierarchy.
Andrew has suggested that I need to document this better :-)
