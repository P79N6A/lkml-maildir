If anything this should be a boot time option or perhaps sysctl, not a config.
In general CONFIGs that change runtime behaviour are evil - just makes
changing the option more painful, causes problems for distribution
users, doesn't make much sense, etc.etc.
Also #ifdef as a documentation device is a really really scary concept.
Yuck.
