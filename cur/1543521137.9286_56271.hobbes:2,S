Subject: cmi8330 + pnp fix for sb_card.c

 As the subject says, there's now support for PnP autodetection
 of the CMI8330 sound adapter.
 There was also a severe bug in the ISA PnP code which leaded
 to bad values in /proc/isapnp when the module is unloaded.
 Patch is against 2.3.36, since 2.3.37 has still some troubles.
 Could someone please test it with other cards than the CMI8330?
 I may have breaked up some code while adding the support for it.
