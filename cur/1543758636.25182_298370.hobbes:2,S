Yes, this API just supports drivers wanting to be more RAS-aware.
It would be happy if how implement it could be separate in two part:
  - arch-specific part
     Capability would depend on arch, can only generic thing but couldn't
     be device specific. Device/bus isolation could be(with help of hotplug
     and so on), but re-enable them would not be easily.
  - generic part
     Capability would depend on drivers, should be more device specific.
How divide and connect them is now in discussion and consideration.

Note that here is a difficulty: the MCA handler on some arch would run on
special context - MCA environment. In other words, since some MCA handler
would be called by non-maskable interrupt(e.g. NMI), so it's difficult to
call some driver's callback using protected kernel locks from MCA context.
Therefore what MCA handler could do is just indicates a error was there,
by something like status flag which drivers can refer. And after possible
deley, we would be able to call callbacks.
