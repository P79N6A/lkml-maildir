The bug here seems to be that we're using the same bit (X86_FEATURE_APIC) to
report two _different_ features. 
We don't represent X86_FEATURE_CXMMX and X86_FEATURE_MMX with the same bit, 
even though they are supposed to provide the same functionality - because 
they are in fact different. Likewise we shouldn't use the same bit for the 
two different types of APIC, IMO.
