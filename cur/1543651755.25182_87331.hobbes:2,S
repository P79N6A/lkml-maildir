Interesting.  Would it be possible to get more details on this
problem?
We can shuffle pages around on the LRU from interrupts at present.
But not the address_space lists and buffer stuff.
We could remove the address_space lists and page->list altogether
with a bit of radix tree work.  I started in on that but got distracted.
mapping->clean_pages is actually obsolete now - we never walk it.  It
could be replaced with list_del_init() everywhere.

OK, thanks.  So I guess we make those locks irq-safe.  I don't
expect that would be feasible in 2.4 because of the hold times in 
truncate - it should be OK in 2.5.  I'll do the patch.
