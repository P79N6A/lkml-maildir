Now that we are defaulting to a bzImage (at least on Intelish
stuff).  Shouldn't the build command just be 'make'?  You could specify
'make zImage' if the default didn't work for you.
I'd like to see:
make - builds the default kernel image
make install - builds the default kernel image and proceeds through the
needed steps to make the image bootable (cp to / and lilo or what ever)
make disk - puts a bootable image on the machine's floppy drive, for
systems that support it
The other make commands could be phased out.
