Hmmm. Okay, it isn't listed in my POSIX reference (which is really dated).
I don't have any docs on this... I did grep around some header files on a
Linux box and it looks to be a fairly complex interface. I'm not opposed
to supporting the interface, but I would like the syscall to be fairly
light-weight.
Would my original proposal cover the POSIX spec with some userland glue?
L8r,
