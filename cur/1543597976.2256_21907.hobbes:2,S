Does 2.4.9 support the Promise Ultra100 TX2 IDE controller?
The title suggests it does, yet the Help for that option does not.
Is this card still only supported in the -ac series?

This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. Since
multiple cards can be installed and there are BIOS ROM problems that
happen if the BIOS revisions of all installed cards (three-max) do
not match, the driver attempts to do dynamic tuning of the chipset
at boot-time for max-speed. Ultra33 BIOS 1.25 or newer is required
for more than one card. This card may require that you say Y to
"Special UDMA Feature (EXPERIMENTAL)".
If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default when
available" as well.
Please read the comments at the top of drivers/ide/pdc202xx.c
If unsure, say N.
