A really major one and I doubt that it would spread wide enough to become
really useful. GCC is really resource-hungry. But the alternative would be
to have one copy of the kernel for each architecture and, possibly,
sub-architectures compiled with everything possible as modules. The, given the
configuration, architecture, sub-architecture the server could provide the
user with a ready-to-go kernel binary. That way the compilation takes place
only once when the kernel is released. All the configurations can be stored
and served again when necessary.
