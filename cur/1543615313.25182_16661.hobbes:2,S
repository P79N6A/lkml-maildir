| 5) 'Properly' set things up so that we don't need the RELOC() macros

Dudes, maybe I'm missing something here, but why don't you just mark the
source data as volatile? Then it _can't_ assume it knows the length of
the strcpy because it can't assume it knows the content:
If PTRRELOC cast the pointer type to
	volatile void *
or something else suitable generic but volatile then this discussion might
not be happening. It would at least move the optimisation into "definite
compiler bug" if it still happens.
