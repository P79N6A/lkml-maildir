It seems to me that a guest should be telling a hypervisor how
frequently it needs a timer interrupt, not vice versa.  And
it should be possible for different guests to have different HZ.
Given all the lkml debate on HZ over the last few years
and the compromise solution (configurable HZ_nnn), forcing
100 Hz on the guest appears to be a step backwards.
(BTW, Xen/ia64 honors all guest's configured HZ.)
