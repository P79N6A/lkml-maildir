Or more testers of things other than <whatever we call stable this week>
(which is where I see the *real* problem as being).
It doesn't matter *what* we call the "testing" releases.  They aren't getting
tested enough.  I've posted a fair number of "the latest -mm broke FOO" notes -
but assuming that "the first guy to hit it" is randomly distributed across all
the -mm users, there really can't be a whole lot of others doing it, as my
number seems to come up waaay too often if there's a large pool of testers...
Either that, or I really *am* the most bleeding-edge loon in my time zone.
