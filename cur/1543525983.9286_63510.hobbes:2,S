Your changes to "time_after()" and "time_after_eq()" are seriously broken.
Changing it from "long" to "int" means that 64-bit jiffies suddenly stop
working on 64-bit architectures.
If you think a cast like "(signed)" will just cast to whatever signed type
the thing has, then you're wrong. The cast "(signed)" is equivalent to
"(signed int)" which in turn is the same as "(int)".
What you want to do is to use similar "before()" and "after()" stuff as
used by the TCP layer.  Make it explicit, don't try to re-use the stuff
that is used for time-keeping.
