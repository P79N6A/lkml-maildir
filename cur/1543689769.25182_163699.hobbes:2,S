Scratch that, I just found Ingo's patch.  My patch does essentially the same
thing except it only allows the current active process to be preempted if it
got demoted in priority during the effective priority recalculation.  This
IMHO is better because it doesn't do unnecessary context switches.  If the
process were truly a CPU hog relative other processes on the run queue, then
it'd get preempted eventually when it gets demoted rather than always every
25 ms.  How come Ingo's granular timeslice patch didn't get put into
2.6.0-test4?

This looks exactly like the granular timeslice patch Ingo did?
