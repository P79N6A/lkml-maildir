If you just removed the check, the worst that would happen is that
after a server reboot you have to remount everything on your clients.
If you submit a patch to make it an option, the worst that can happen
is that I jump on you (but I'm not a good long jumper, so you are
pretty safe).
I plan to make a change to knfsd in the near future so that you can
have an option like:
   fs=27
in /etc/exports and the the kernel puts the magic number "27" in the
filehandle instead of the device number.  Then as long as you export
each filesystem with a unique and consistant fs number, you won't need
to worry about the instability of device numbers.
