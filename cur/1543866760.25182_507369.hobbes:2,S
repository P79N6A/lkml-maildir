Even if you have everything, every page, every log file, in the page
cache, everything talking over the network wants to block.
Will you create a thread every time tcp_sendmsg() hits the send queue
limits?
Add some logging to tcp_sendmsg() on a busy web server if you do not
believe me :-)
The idea is probably excellent for operations on real files, but it's
going to stink badly for networking stuff.
