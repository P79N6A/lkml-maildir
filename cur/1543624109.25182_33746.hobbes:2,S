Hi all
I guess someone else did a similar question, but i didn't saw any good
answer.
Has anybody tried to compile a 2.4.x with cd burning  capabilities?, I
have a HP 8230 CD-R usable with RH 7.2 kernels, but when i try to
upgrade to a bigger version (say 1.4.8 or 9pre2-ac4)  The drive is not
recognized, not at boot nor when connected on running system.
I don't know if I'm missing some label on make config, i set scssi
emulation, even the cd-r 82** module for the cd burner, and of course
USB needed flags too.
Anyone have any advice for me?, I have even used a google found how-to,
but nothing have worked in a couple of month of trials.
