 JFTR, in the absence of an external write-back buffer (which some
processors have) the MIPS "sync" instruction has exactly the semantics of
mb().  There is no MIPS instruction to perform writeback, invalidation,
etc. operations on whole caches -- such operations can only be performed
in the kernel mode on a line-by-line basis and are model-specific, though
some standardisation exists.
