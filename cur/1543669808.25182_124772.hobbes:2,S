They are caught by the recently added regexp parser and don't need to be
listed explicitly. If you're running ./lk-changelog.pl --selftest, it'll
print a list of addresses that are matched by a regexp (the printout
actually suggests the opposite, but that's an implementation detail;
these lookups are tuned for speed).
