Hi Marcelo
Ian had some compilation error while trying to compile 2.4.20-pre7
this is the error that he got:
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h: In function `kstat_irqs':
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:57: `smp_num_cpus' undeclared
(first use in this function)
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:57: (Each undeclared
identifier is reported only once
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/kernel_stat.h:57: for each function it
appears in.)make[2]:
*** [ksyms.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/kernel'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2
He got this when he was compiling a UP kernel. When
he tries to compile for a SMP kernel the error goes away.
Which makes sense because smp_num_cpus is only defined fro SMP
kernels. Does the following patch look OK? This is adopted from 2.5.38.
Cheers
