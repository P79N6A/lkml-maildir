_all_ default locking and atomic APIs should be barrier-safe i believe. 
(and that includes atomic_inc() too) Most people dont have barriers on 
their mind when their code. _If_ someone is barrier-conscious then we 
should have barrier-less APIs too for that purpose of squeezing the last 
half cycle out of the code, but it should be a non-default choice. The 
reason: nobody notices an unnecessary barrier, but a missing barrier can 
be nasty.
