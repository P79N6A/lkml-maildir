Creating software costs money.
Open source doesn't produce very much money.
A world in which all software is produced via support contracts doesn't
look like a world in which there is very much new software.
Yes, that makes me unhappy.  I like programming, I like being paid to
do it.  I've done the consulting gig and that's a crappy way to live,
you don't make enough money to actually fix things, you make enough to
hack things so they sort of work.  No customer is going to pay you to
rearchitect GCC when what they want is support for their new chip.
That's probably a good enough test case.  Explain to me how your support
contracts are ever going to provide enough money to redo GCC or build
something equally substantial.
I'm not saying that you can't make a living doing support, you obviously
can.  I'm saying that it doesn't produce enough income to do what needs
to be done.  If it did then CVS would be BK, for example.
