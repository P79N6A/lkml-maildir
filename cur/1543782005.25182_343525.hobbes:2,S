idr was specifically designed with unlocked pre-allocation in mind.  The
change you're proposing wants to allow pre allocation from irq context.
This really doesn't look like a good change because the whole point of
pre allocation is to do it at a point in time when the system can sleep
if it has to.
What I don't understand is why you need to pre allocate this tag from
irq context.  Best practise is to allocate when you have user context
but make use of it in IRQ context.

So you're planning to do some type of tag command queueing outside of
the block framework?  Could you just look at what it would take to do it
within the existing framework first?  I seem to have wasted quite a bit
of time recently pulling spurious queueing code out of Adaptec drivers.
Remember that the code is adaptable ... we have non-block devices that
use block queues for instance.
