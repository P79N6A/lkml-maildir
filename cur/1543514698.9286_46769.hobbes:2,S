Pavel,
The architecture of the RAID drivers is extremely primitive, and
limiting, and does not handle hotixing or distributed cases.  There are
dependencies on NWFS for controlling th mirroring.  At present, the
buffer cache does not support a logical semantic.  It's true we could
"stand on our heads" and map something very unnatural to what's there,
but there are still issues and problems with the buffer cache and how it
acts.  There are also config issues.  NWFS style allows end users to
configure and use mirroring on Linux without needing a degree in
astro-physics to understand how to set it up.  
We basically need a smarter cache than what's there.  Eventually, Linux
will evolve there (Since the page cache already resembles what's in NT).
