Subject: i2c-adap-ite.h is missing from kernel tree

I'm trying to get this i2c-ite.c (formerly 'i2c-adap-ite.c', in the
2.4 kernel) driver to compile in a 2.6.11 kernel, but there is the
following line which is a stumper:
#include <linux/i2c-adap-ite.h>
I can't for the life of me (or anywhere in google even!) find a file
called i2c-adap-ite.h in the 2.6 or 2.4 kernel.
Does anyone out there have it or know where it went?
