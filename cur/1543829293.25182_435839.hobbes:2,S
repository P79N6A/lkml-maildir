Does it have to?  I presume this has been considered before, but what if 
the other CPUs were just idled for suspend rather than "removed"?  Or do 
you actually need to simulate a hot-remove to make sure they get 
suspended properly?  In general, the "hot remove as suspend" thing seems 
semantically awkward.
