It was also made available to root to use so that syslog could continue
to write to the root file system. Also, I believe pipe buffers were optionally
stored in the root filesystem under tight memory conditions. Filling root
with user data usually caused the system to hang trying to handle pipes and
domain sockets (which syslog used...).
The reserve then allowed the root user time to log in and clean up some
things before the system died. Most user processes were put to sleep.
At least this was the case under UNIX System V release 2.
