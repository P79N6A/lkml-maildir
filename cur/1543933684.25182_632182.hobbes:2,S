Well, I wouldn't say it's abotu "preferring" one over the other. It's very 
possible that the BIOS writers were *intending* to prefer ACPI 2.0, and it 
may even be likely that they thought that they wrote it that way, but the 
real issue is that it has apparently never ever been *tested* that way.
So yes, maybe the vendors actually thought they were a good ACPI-2.0 
implementation, but if Windows doesn't do the ordering that the 2.0 spec 
expects, then that is pretty much just a theoretical thing.
But yeah, it would be really nice to have this verified some way. Somebody 
must already know (whether it's a VM person or a BIOS writer, and whether 
they'd tell us, is obviously another issue).
