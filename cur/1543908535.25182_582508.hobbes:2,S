Subject: [2.6.20.16 review 22/28] POWERPC: Fix subtle FP state corruption bug in signal return on SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This fixes a bug which can cause corruption of the floating-point state
on return from a signal handler.  If we have a signal handler that has
used the floating-point registers, and it happens to context-switch to
another task while copying the interrupted floating-point state from the
user stack into the thread struct (e.g. because of a page fault, or
because it gets preempted), the context switch code will think that the
FP registers contain valid FP state that needs to be copied into the
thread_struct, and will thus overwrite the values that the signal return
code has put into the thread_struct.
This can occur because we clear the MSR bits that indicate the presence
of valid FP state after copying the state into the thread_struct.  To fix
this we just move the clearing of the MSR bits to before the copy.  A
similar potential problem also occurs with the Altivec state, and this
fixes that in the same way.
