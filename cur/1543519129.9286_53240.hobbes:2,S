No, they are not. Mostly. DOS world are using cp866 where all graphs are in
the same position as cp437. There was a lot of different encodings initially
but near 1988-89 year cp866 winned. EXACTLY due need to use #$#$%& programs
with imagination that all world is using cp437 :-(( MS Word for DOS macroses
was nightmare however: MS Word is using characters with codes 0xAE and 0xAF to
mark parts of macro. Unfortunatelly 0xAE and 0xAF is just plain russian letters
in cp866 and so macroses locked plain ugly. In Linux world though we are using
KOI8-R (and KOI8-U sometimes but NOT iso-8859-5 like glibc thinks :-) but not
straight: cp866 is loaded via setfont and mapscrn used to map KOI8-R => cp866.
It's needed due VGA limitations. So you can draw pseudographics in "\033(U"
mode and russian filenames in "\033(K". And a lot of programs actually works
this way. I can switch to cp866 with printf "\033(U" and back to koi8-r with
printf "\033(K" but in both modes mc will draw lines just fine !
