Any reasons or concerns as to why I can't reserve any address space 
starting from 0?
To make my motivation clearer, here is the application scenario.
My system will load an initial OS (could be a strip down Linux or some
simple RTOS) into the low memory starting from address 0.  The initial OS
will then load Linux into higher memory region, say @100M.  Then control jumps
to Linux while the initial OS is still lurking in the RAM for future
use.

So if I don't have ISA performing DMA, I should be OK in this regard?
Thanks.
