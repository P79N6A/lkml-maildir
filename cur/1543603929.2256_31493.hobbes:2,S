  Depending on implementation, this may be an acceptable default,
assuming that the code can determine when too many irqs are being
serviced. There are many servers, and even workstations in campus
environments, which would benefit from changing to polling under burst
load. I don't know if even a router need be locked in that state, it
should stay there under normal load.
  I'm convinced that polling under heavy load is beneficial or
non-harmful on virtually every type of networked machine. Actually, any
machine subject to interrupt storms, many device interface or control
systems can get high rates due to physical events, networking is just a
common problem.
