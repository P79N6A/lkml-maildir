write_inode_now() seems ok.
If !mapping_cap_writeback_dirty(), the inode is bdev_inode itself or
ram-based fs's inode, so ->write_inode() is not needed.  And if
backing_dev is ramdisk, mapping->backing_dev_info was setted the
following special bdi.
static struct backing_dev_info rd_file_backing_dev_info = {
	.ra_pages	= 0,			/* No readahead */
	.capabilities	= BDI_CAP_MAP_COPY,	/* Does contribute to dirty memory */
	.unplug_io_fn	= default_unplug_io_fn,
};
