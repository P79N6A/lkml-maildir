kjourald wrote the page's buffers back (ext3 in ordered-data mode).  The VM
didn't know about that, so we have a PageDirty page which has clean
buffers.
We rely upon the VFS writeback code to "discover" that this dirty page has
clean buffers: the VFS will attempt to write the dirty page and will end up
marking the page clean without performing any IO.
