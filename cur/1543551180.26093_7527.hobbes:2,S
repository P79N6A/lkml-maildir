Yes, but there is often the scenario where you have an UDMA66 capable
drive and a say ZIP drive which makes the 80c cable undetectable by the
drive. In that case a command line option would help, so that the kernel
doesn't have to be recompiled for that.
I think it'd be good to think of 'ide0=ata66' as an option that disables
all the 80-wire checks and consider that option dangerous, but still
very useful. 
If you could get the byte93 stuff correct, I'd agree with you that the
'ide0=ata66' should not mess with it, but it's impossible to get it
correct due to devices like IOMEGA ZIP.

Well, yes.

I'll have to try that.
