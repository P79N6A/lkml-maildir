Hello, I tried the patch you wrote (and noticed it is now in 2.4.22-ac3)
but I still have the same hard lockup Pawel Dziekonski has -- and, like
him, everything works when I don't compile ACPI into the kernel. My mobo is
a Soyo K7VTA-PRO, Athlon 950 Mhz, chipset VIA82Csomething.
Is there a piece of information I could send you that would help (BIOS
settings, /proc listings)? Please CC to me at j[CUBAN-DICTATOR'S-SURNAME]
@vialink.com.br, I'm not subscribed to LKML (but could be since I'm getting
broadband today. Yay!) :)
Cheers all,
