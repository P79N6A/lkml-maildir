I will _not_ accept just stupid reverts, if that means that a device 
driver is not available for people to test with.
We do not break drivers like that, and the reason you have clashes with 
other people is that so many drivers ended up being broken for too long. 
Feel free to revert the changes one by one _as_they_get_fixed_. But don't 
even try to send me a patch that reverts things to a broken state. The PnP 
changes have been painful enough as-is.
