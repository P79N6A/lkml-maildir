I'm sure you'll have no problem writing the userland daemon to do this
then, so the people writing the kernel side of the equation know
exactly what it requires of them when they do their job...
Personally, I can't see any point in writing a single line of kernel
code to address this issue until such time as a reasonably working
daemon exists that does its side of the job, and as you don't see any
point in writing the two in parallel...
Best wishes from Riley.
