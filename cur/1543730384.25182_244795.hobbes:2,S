What does this buy you that having the separate daemon just do
a fork/seteuid/exec to do the work, and passing the results back via a
Unix socket or shared mem or what-have-you?
Alternatively, what would this give you that isn't already done by
the SELinux support for cron, or Apache suexec, which already allow
"run the following in another context" functionality?
