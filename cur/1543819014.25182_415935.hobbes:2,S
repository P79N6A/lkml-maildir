	Almost definitely not. Here you have two works that provide two distinctly
different functions and communicate across a well-defined boundary. In
theory, the two works could have been developed completely independently, so
one cannot be a derivative work of the other.
	The thing you need to remember is that the API that userspace uses to
communicate with the kernel is itself a work. In this case, it almost
certainly is purely functional and contains no protectable, copyrightable
content. Both the kernel changes and the user-space code take only from the
API. They do not take from each other.
