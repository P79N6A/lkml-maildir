Yeah, I didn't look closely at your patch. I assumed it was dropping the
mmap_sem for the duration of the IO, so I didn't think there could be
significant read hold time there. Of course reads would still show up
somewhat if there is a lot of write contention, but they would not
necessarily be the cause of the problem.

Yeah... I don't exactly call it a "fix"... It's tricky code... In other
cases you slow down.
Of course we should try to improve the kernel for user workloads, but we
also need to steer users toward workloads that are going to work well and
be nice for us to work with and optimise in future.
Threads are more often than not, not a good solution. There is lots of
other locks in the kernel (and userspace) that are going to slow things
down. I bet this workload would actually be much faster if the app was
designed with processes (and shared memory in the cases where it needs
to be shared).

Because the madvise is just a hint, but you still go through with the
fault, so in rare cases yes perhaps the fault will need to re-read the
page if it has been reclaimed in the meantime, but those are the cases
where the fault retry code has a chance to have a starvation issue.
