 There are issues with that approach:
 - Code with firmware will not be accepted in the kernel, there are
   already two drivers that are being hold back for that reason.
   	- Licensing issues.
	- Memory consumption.
	- "new" kernel policy.
 - A device may need to reload firmware upon reset. And if you mark it
   __init, it will not be there.
 - If you include the firmware in the code you have to recompile the
   kernel to update the firmware. Pavel, back me up on this one with the
   ACPI tables issue.

 If the device losses the firmware upon suspend, the driver will have to
 reinitialize it as if it just got plugged, which somehow makes all
 devices hotplugable.
 If the driver uses request_firmware(), it doesn't need to handle any
 special case, just initialize as usual and it will get the firmware
 when it needs it.
 If the device is needed to access the filesystem, some kind of
 persistence will be needed, so the required firmware is already in
 kernel space. But the driver doesn't need to care, it will just ask for
 the firmware as usual.
 Which brings me to another issue, the same device can be required to
 access the filesystem or not:
	- In a diskless client, it is the network card
	- In a live-cd it is the cdrom drive
	- In a multi disk system just one of them will be holding
	  required firmware.
 So you can not decide at coding time, the latest at compile time, and
 ideally at runtime (which is what I am trying to do).

 OK, how about:
  int request_firmware_nowait (
  		struct module *module,
 		const char *name, const char *device, void *context,
 		void (*cont)(const struct firmware *fw, void context)
  );
  request_firmware code will try_module_get/module_put as needed.
  Would that fix the issue?

 I'll do the timeout anyway, and make it configurable just in case.

 Don't be, this is still the kind of feedback I want. Weather I manage
 or not, I get the chance to fix the issues.
