Interrupts default to OFF within an interrupt handler. Given this,
why would you use a spin-lock within the ISR on a single-processor
machine?
To directly answer your question, YES, you can use a spin-lock
within an ISR even though it won't do anything except add code
on a single processor machine.
On multiple CPU machines, you can use the form of spin-lock that
does not save/restore interrupts within the ISR, and use the
save/restore versions, with the same lock variable, outside the
ISR.
