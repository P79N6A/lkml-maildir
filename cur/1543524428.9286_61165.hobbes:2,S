Some information available from the system is quite valuable for attacker
with local access to the system - e.g. the CPU in the machine (think of the
ancient F00F bug for example and possibility to exploit it), memory size
(now everyone can type 'free' or just browse through /proc to find all there
is about memory size and usage), partition sizes of the attached block
devices,  interrupts, IO ports and many more. That information is not always
security hazard when given away, but nevertheless it (IMHO) shouldn't be
available for the common user but just for the privileged processes which,
in turn, wouldn't have to be ran as UID0 if there were appropriate
capabilities. My particular case was that I'm developing a WWW-based system
for the users that have no shell access to the server and therefore cannot
check what is their quota, disk usage etc. Now, to check that info the quota
utility has to be ran either as root or as the user being checked. In my
case, the process to examine the quotas is a CGI script written (for
example) in C and I WON'T allow CGI execution as UID0 and change of UID to
the target user's is out of the question since the httpd runs as its own
user permamently and has no way to change its personality. Now, if I had a
possibility to equip my CGI with capabilities to READ quotas of any user,
then everything would work just fine. As it is now, I won't equip the
process with any capabilities that woyuld allow it to read quotas, since
these same caps allow the process to change quotas and CGI code is never
safe when allowed to do too much... For now I have just written a daemon
process that runs chrooted as root and the CGI script connects to it
(running as specific user), passess its credentials and if they match a
compile-time defaults, the quota information is returned and shown to the
user. Well... it works, but is far from elegant and much more complicated
than it would be if I had the capabilities we're discussing now.
