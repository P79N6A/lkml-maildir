Subject: a Preliminary Linux porting Guide draft, please give your feedback and corrections

Hi,
Over the last few weeks, I had looked into Linux from _porting
perspective_, but as there where no good porting guides, I thought I will
put down what  ever I find into a document format.
So I have uploaded it into my website
www.hanishkvc.com - my work/my documents section (Linux and Portability)
or if the direct link can be accesed then
http://hanishkvc.tripod.com/work/docs/LinuxAJourney.html
It talks about the Hardware Abstraction Layer of Linux, which one has to
update/modify in order for Linux to work on a new target.
So do go thro it, had give me your suggestions and any corrections.
Also a strange thing happened in that the earlier emails which I had sent
to the list along with the html doc as attachment never surfaced on the
list. I did that so that I can get feedback on it before I put it on my site.
However because of the problem, this time I haven't attached it to the
email.
So If anyone got this email earlier, then I apologize for this repeat. I
am sending this again as I will be happy to know as to how right or wrong
I am regarding Linux porting issues.
Keep :-)
