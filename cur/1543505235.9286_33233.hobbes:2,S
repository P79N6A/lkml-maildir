1. Go to "General Setup".
2. Set "PCI support" to No.
3. "PCI access mode" is not dimmed, and you are still allowed to set it.
This is reproducible with xconfig, but not with menuconfig (menuconfig
doesn't let you set "PCI access mode" if "PCI support" is set to no).
I have no idea if this bug exists in earlier kernels. I just noticed it
now, while configuring a relatively small kernel for a PCI-less 486 I
have.
