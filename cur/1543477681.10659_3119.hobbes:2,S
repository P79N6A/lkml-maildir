Yes, thanks.  It's XCHG where it's implicit.

Um, yes, but the other half is the cmpxchg instruction, which is only
available on the 486 and up.  One won't work without the other.

486, actualy.  CMPXCHG8B is new to the Pentium.

Ah, right, thanks.
Um, in truth I just thought of a technique that should work on the 386
without the semaphore.
Remembering that the basic operation is
	if (sem->waiting > 0) {
		sem->waiting--;
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
I think that (with %0 being "=m" (sem->waiting)) : "0" (sem->waiting))
the following code ought to work.
1:	lock; decl %0
	jns 2f	/* If result >= 0, success */
	lock; incl %0	/* Went too far; go back */
	jg 1b	/* If result > 0, retry */
	return 0;
2:
	return 1;
Here, we're transiently letting sem->waiting drop below zero.
As long as nobody gets confused, that should be fine.
Imagine it's one and four processes land on this code at once.
The first one will decrement it to zero and succeed.
The other three will decrement it to -3 and all get negative
results (-1, -2 and -3, but only the sign bit is visible afterwards).
Now suppose somebody increments it in the meantime, so it's now -2.
The first two processes will increment it to -1 ans 0 respectively,
and fail (as they should).  The last will increment it to one and
fall into the retry loop.
I think I've traced through all the paths and it works, but I'd like
a second set of eyes, if possible, to make sure I haven't missed anything.
Thanks!
