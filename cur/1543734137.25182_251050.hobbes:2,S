If 2.95.3 is broken, then drop that. Before dropping gcc2 support entirely,
you should prove all versions are broken.
And yes, the 2.95.4 I've been using happily for about 4 years is Debian.
Not only does it compile about twice as quickly, it produces better code
than anything else I've tested (though 3.x is finally getting close).
