Very much depends on your view of consistent :-)

Ah, see, you're missing a detail (see below for the full story). Its the
irq state that must be consistent. So if at any one point you take the
lock in an irq safe context, you must always take it irq safe.

Quite, but we must also take note of the irq state.

Right, which is where I gleaned your usage from..

Ah, you can play tricks here :-) All you need to ensure are consisent
class uses. So if your normal usage is 0->1->2->3 etc.. all you need to
ensure is that the reverse never happens.
Also, have you looked at explicit lock_class_key usage per chip? That
way you can avoid using the _nested annotation. You can set a class on a
lock right after spin_lock_init() using lockdep_set_class*().
Look at it this way:
 spin_lock_irq()   := local_irq_disable(); spin_lock();
 spin_unlock_irq() := spin_unlock(); local_irq_enable();
 spin_lock_irq_nested() : local_irq_disable(); spin_lock_nested();
 spin_lock_irq(&parent_desc->lock);	local_irq_disable();
					spin_lock(&parent_desc->lock);
 spin_lock_irq_nested(&desc->lock, 1);	local_irq_disable();
 					spin_lock_nested(&desc->lock, 1)
 spin_unlock_irq(&desc->lock);		spin_unlock(&desc->lock);
					local_irq_enable(); <--- BUG!
 spin_unlock_irq(&parent_desc->lock);	spin_unlock(&parent_desc->lock);
					local_irq_enable();
At the BUG site lockdep will warn because parent_desc->lock is still
held as hardirq-safe lock, but the context is hardirq-unsafe.
It will become an actual deadlock if at that point an IRQ happens and
tries to acquire parent_desc->lock.
The safe approach is using spin_lock_irqsave{,_nested}().
