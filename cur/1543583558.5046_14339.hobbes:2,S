Stevens' example code assumes that it does. And given the number of people
that regard his work as Holy, it might not be a bad idea to implement Linux
so that it does what people think it does.
I would've sworn, based on the fact that I saw people do it, that ftruncate
was a legitimate way to extend a file - especially useful in combination
with mmap().
I don't really care where it is done, in glibc or in the kernel - but let's
honor this convention and not needlessly break code.
