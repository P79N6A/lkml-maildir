For the record: I was surprised to see early_param() patches go into the
-mm tree during 2.6.  However, the way they were done was too invasive
and introduced a third parser in the kernel.  I reworked them to be
minimal and use existing parsers: this patch is 1/2 in that series.

I support that, if there's no real need for an arch-indep early_param().
