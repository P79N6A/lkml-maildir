If your distribution ships 2.6.x and your hardware is not supported 
before 2.6.x+1 you need your own kernel.
The expectation "only kernel hackers don't use distribution kernels" is 
wrong in too many cases.
"System administrator" is a target audience of the kernel configuration, 
and we should make it as easy as possible for such people to compile 
their own kernel.
