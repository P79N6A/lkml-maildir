    I agree.  VesaFB is the only code (as far as I know) which attempts to grab
an MTRR more than once.  The restrictions on MTRR size and alignment are too
numerous to attempt a logical resizing in a small amount of code-- especially
since the retrictions are different depending on the processor.  Might I suggest
that the looping code be taken out entirely, perhaps outputting success or
failure like:
#ifdef CONFIG_MTRR
if (mtrr)
  if (mtrr_add(video_base, video_size, MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB, 1) == -EINVAL)
    printk(KERN_INFO "vesafb:  Could not allocate MTRR\n");
  else
    printk(KERN_INFO "vesafb:  MTRR Write-Combining enabled\n");
#endif  /* CONFIG_MTRR */
