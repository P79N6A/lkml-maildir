Okay.  I've been looking at stock 2.6.1 noticed  that the fix for this
issue that Rusty proposed, and that ultimately made it into 2.6.1-rc3
(or so) is not correct.  The problem is that we do:
err = module_frob_arch_sections(hdr, sechdrs, secstrings, mod);
/* Which goes over every .debug section and can take _ages_ on something
 * like ipv6 */
... skip 100 lines ...
.... Checks Rusty / Linus added ...
The following patch fixes the problem for me on PPC32:

IMHO, this shouldn't be covered under a PPC32 test since at least PPC32,
PPC64 and Alpha have this issue, and I suspect that ia64, parisc, s390
and v850 have the problem as well (based on what their module_arch_frob
bits look to be doing).
