I have tried this on Red Hat 9 with 2.5.68 kernel (no modules), nfs-utils
version 1.0.1.
NFS3 server was running on the box and it was exporting a mounted /mnt/cdrom to
the world. On "umount /mnt/cdrom" it reported "device busy". On "eject
/mnt/cdrom" it locked the system hard.
One of the previous 2.5.x kernels that I've tried was .65 and that one would
lock up on NFS startup. So, things are better, but not yet completely good.
What kind of information would help debugging this?
