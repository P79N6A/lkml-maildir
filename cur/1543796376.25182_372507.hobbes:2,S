Maybe, but wouldn't that be a workaround?

Maybe I shouldn't have cc'd kernel.

Yes! And much more...
One reason why linux is great is because it's flexible.  But flexibility 
sometimes leads you to fulfill requirements in a workaround fashion.  Things 
get worse when you start building on these workarounds.
GNU/OpenSource is prone to such a development.
What I propose is to stop and think always; identify the problem and provide 
for a _scalable_ solution.  Procrastinating using workarounds may make your 
development cycle seem faster, when in fact you are inhibiting it.
Here specifically, ip/ifconfig is implemented upside-down requiring a 
link/dev to exist for an address to be defined, in effect containing layer 3 
inside layer 2, when an address should be allowed to be defined w/o a 
link/dev much like an app is allowed to be defined w/o an address.
Thanks for all your comments!
