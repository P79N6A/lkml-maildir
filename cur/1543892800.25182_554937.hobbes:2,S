Hi folks,
the following patch series is a backport of the futex fixups for stable.
Patch 1 and 2 are identical to the mainline version.
Patch 3 is a backport as there were other major changes in the futex code
in mainline. The design of the fixes is identical to the mainline version.
Should be applicable to 2.6.20 and earlier as well.
Please apply ASAP. The bugs in the futex code cause memory leaks and
kernel oopsen and are easily exploitable from user space.
Thanks,
	tglx
