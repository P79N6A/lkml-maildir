Because I consider this as the only correct way.
sendmsg() behaviour is not prescribed by any standards
and this way is preferred, because:
- it is error prone: bad msg_name and msg_namelen!=0 is
  usual application bug, showing malloc failure or memory corruption.
- it saves one statement if (name==NULL) namelen=0
BTW some time ago recvfrom() behaved in the same manner,
but broken way appeared to be described as valid in UNIX98,
so that it was changed.
