Do I understand this correctly?  You've got special handling for the 
case where a bus handler doesn't have a resume routine, but no special 
handling for the case where it doesn't have a suspend routine?  Why 
bother to remove the device if neither routine exists (there won't be 
any need to revive it since the bus never got suspended)?
And why not simply fail the suspend if the resume routine doesn't exist
and the suspend routine does?  Maybe with an error message in the
system log.
