The commit is not strange it is wrong :( Sorry David, when I checked
the according proc files, I saw that both files show sockets, but
overlooked that the raw6 one shows the ipv4 part of the ipv6 socket.
Denis noticed that this morning and has already prepared a fix.
So please, do not revert the commit, the fix will be at your mailbox today.
Thanks, Adrian.
