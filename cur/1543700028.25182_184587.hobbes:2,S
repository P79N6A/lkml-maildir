Maybe I don't get it, but shouldn't large stripes help RAID5 as well?
For any write, you do the rmw stuff, so you have two seeks on two
drives, one of which is the parity one.  For RAID0, the same access
would result in one seek on one drive, but no fundamental difference.
With more than three drives, you should be able to parallelize the
seeks on RAID5 as well, shouldn't you?  So the same reasoning wrt long
stripes should apply, unless I'm stupid again.
