Getting locking right if you want to allow access from above and below
the stackable filesystems will be a pain.  Note that I can't see any
way to exclude direct access to the underlying filesystem in ecryptfs.

I don't think there's too much of example for the behaviour I want.
But lets explain it a little better:
 - The idea is to avoid having the underlying filesystem mounted in any
   public namespace.
 - Linux has the concept of mount points that only the kernel can use and
   that aren't visible to any public namespace.  They can be created using
   the *kern_mount family of APIs.
 - I suggest to use this API to mount the underlying filesystems from
   ecryptfs.  It will have a reference to the vfsmount * and thus all
   important data for the underlying filesystem.  Because it is the only
   user of that filesystem locking and other operations get a lot simpler.
