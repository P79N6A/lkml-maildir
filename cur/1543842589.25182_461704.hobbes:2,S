Thanks! The key (mentioned in the documentation there) is to disable
framebuffer (ATI video card). First time I've had suspend-to-RAM working
on this machine. ;)
Suspending works with `s2ram -f`, no other options needed, from X.
# s2ram -i
This machine can be identified by:
    sys_vendor   = "Dell Computer Corporation"
    sys_product  = "Inspiron 5100                   "
    sys_version  = ""
    bios_version = "A23"
Though you may want to rename the /usr/sbin/suspend command to something
other than 'suspend' as, at least for me, it is a shell command which
puts the current shell in the background.
The HOWTO *does* mention:
[Warning: some shells have "suspend" built in command, so specifing
exact path like ./suspend is more important than usual.]
Though I still believe it'd be a good idea to pick a non-conflicting name.
