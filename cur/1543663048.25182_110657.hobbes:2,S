From dmesg:
serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ IRQ sharing enabled
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
pnp: the driver 'serial' has been registered
pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:12' and the driver 'serial'
pnp: res: the device '00:12' has been activated.
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:13' and the driver 'serial'
pnp: match found with the PnP device '01:02.00' and the driver 'serial'
pnp: res: the device '01:02.00' has been activated.
ttyS2 at I/O 0x3e8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
Notice ttyS1 and ttyS0 are both reporting irq 3. This is impossible because 
IBM's BIOS refuses to let me share IRQ's with serial ports. This is also 
causing a problem with the ISA PnP modem which apparently doesn't have an IRQ 
that it can use because of this.
Shawn.
