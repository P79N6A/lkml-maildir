His does. From his cpuinfo:
processor	: 7
vendor_id	: GenuineIntel
cpu family	: 15
model		: 1
model name	: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 1.40GHz
stepping	: 1
cpu MHz		: 1399.982
cache size	: 256 KB
fdiv_bug	: no
hlt_bug		: no
f00f_bug	: no
coma_bug	: no
fpu		: yes
fpu_exception	: yes
cpuid level	: 2
wp		: yes
flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm
bogomips	: 2798.38
See that ht flag near the end?
Don't know why he doesn't go with RH 9 or RH AS though.
