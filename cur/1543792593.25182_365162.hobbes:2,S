Depending on the CONFIG_MIGRATION, the type of buffer_migrate_page(a,b)
expansion is either int or void *, which doesn't look right.
Moreover below you have initializations
        .migrate_page		= buffer_migrate_page,
that wouldn't compile when CONFIG_MIGRATION is not defined (as macro
requires two arguments).
Nikita.
