Nice tool. 
Some remarks. You can build high resolution timer support without the
extra lib package from the HRT sourceforge site. You need a recent glibc
and  some quirks in the source. See the cyclictest program I'm using.

It would also be cute to add tests for the PI support for
pthread_mutexes.
