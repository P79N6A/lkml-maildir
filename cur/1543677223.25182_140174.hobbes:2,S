Subject: [PATCH][LSM] Early init for security modules and various cleanups 0/4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/13/22

The subsequent patches are LSM updates relative to current bk.
The early init patch has been reviewed by arch maintainers, and nearly
all acked the first version.  This current version is a slight refinement
based on feedback from Sam Ravnborg, and was acked by at least DaveM.
I would be glad to split it apart however necessary to get it merged.
It's the last piece needed before the SELinux module can begin working
on merging.  The cleanups include removal of two unused hooks, and a bug
fix from Jakub Jelinek.  These patches have been tested on x86.  Please
let me know if there is any problem with merging these patches.
thanks,
-chris
