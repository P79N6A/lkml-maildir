PATCH 2.6.24-rc3-mm1:  bnx2x depends on ZLIB_INFLATE
The bnx2x module depends on the zlib_inflate functions.  The
build will fail if ZLIB_INFLATE has not been selected manually
or by building another module that automatically selects it.
Modify BNX2X config option to 'select ZLIB_INFLATE' like BNX2
and others.  This seems to fix it.
