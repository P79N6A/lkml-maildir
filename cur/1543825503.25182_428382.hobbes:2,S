Yes, it just seemed confusing to be including these two items in the
same patch.  I was trying to indicate that the 64k block support should
be submitted to Mingming as a standalone patch atop her patch series,
which is the one that will be submitted for kernel inclusion.

Agreed.  However, there will be a different COMPAT flag for large
filesystems introduced as part of the other 48-bit ext3 changes.
Cheers, Andreas
