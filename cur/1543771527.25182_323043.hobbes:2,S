The latest 2.6.12-rc5-mm2 tree fails to boot on some of the 64p
SGI systems. The system hangs immediately after printing:
	...
	Inode-cache hash table entries: 8388608 (order: 12, 67108864 bytes)
	Mount-cache hash table entries: 1024
	Boot processor id 0x0/0x0
	Brought up 64 CPUs
	Total of 64 processors activated (118415.36 BogoMIPS).
I have isolated the failure to cpu 0 hanging in sched_balance_self() during
a fork (or clone).  The "while" loop at the end of function never 
terminates, ie. sd is never NULL.
Is this a problem that you have seen before. If not, I'll do some
more digging & isolate the problem.
