I suspect there may be a problem with interrupts handling on your system.
There is 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11698
 describing a very
similar (if not the same) issue.  Please attach a boot log and the contents
of /proc/interrupts to that bug.

Unfortunately, I don't.  If I have any patches that can possibly fix the
problem, I'll let you know.

Please check if the appended patch from Len changes anything.

    ACPI: PCI Interrupt Links -- disable when unused
    
    We start the system off with disabled links.
    Here we enable the reference counting
    on the links so that when drivers free IRQs
    the links can return to the disabled state.
    
    Drivers free their IRQ and reference on a link
    when they unload.  They may also do so upon
    suspend.  However, if they don't, irqrouter_resume()
    will still resume any links that were
    not disabled before suspend.
