I asked because I had thought it would be a serious conflict: obviously
the patches as such would conflict quite a bit, but that's not serious,
one or the other just gets fixed up.
But now I don't see it - we both want to grab a further bit from the
low bits of the page->mapping pointer, you PAGE_MAPPING_INFO and me
PAGE_MAPPING_SWAP; but that's okay, so long as whoever is left using
bit (1<<2) is careful about the 32-bit case and remembers to put
__attribute__((aligned(sizeof(long long))))
on the declarations of struct address_space and struct anon_vma
and your struct page_mapping_info.
Would that waste a little memory?  I think not with SLUB,
but perhaps with SLOB, which packs a little tighter.
