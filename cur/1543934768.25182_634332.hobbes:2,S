My base patch only touches other architectures to remove the no longer
needed HAVE_ARCH_BUG. Given the new ifdef in bug.h, there's nothing
functional that breaks if they're left in (i.e. split up in two
patches).
The only problem with merging it up the x86 path is that the powerpc
patch that builds on it would need to be ordered after the x86 merge
(in mm etc), or it'll cause build breaks. Keeping it in -mm is nice in
that way since Andrew could sequence them right when sending to Linus.
Easiest of all might be to get an Acked-by from Paul on the powerpc patch,
and merge it all up through x86.git?
(Paul: This is powerpc-switch-to-generic-warn_on-bug_on.patch in -mm
I'm talking about).
