It does not give me what I requested.  I requested 1280x1024.  I get a 
broken 1024x768.
I know that when EDID reports only 1280x1024, everything works fine, but 
for whatever reason, my LCD monitor reports 1024x768 first, and that's 
what it uses.
I did some searching, and I'm not the only person who reports this 
problem.  I found a patch for it online.  I'll see if I can't dig that 
up for you.
