We don't have that luxury on IBM System p machines, where the
hypervisor manages memory in much larger units than a page.  Typically
the size of memory block that the hypervisor uses to manage memory is
16MB or more -- which makes sense from the point of view that if the
hypervisor had to manage individual pages, it would end up adding a
lot more overhead than it does.
