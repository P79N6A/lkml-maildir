Hi,
I have a question about scheduling latencies in 2.4.20. We are seeing
that our
process (started with default priority, normal fork, exec) is not
scheduled
on the CPU for 4 seconds (from our kernel traces). Is that possible
under
heavy load ? We believe the process is still alive but I wanted to know
if
anybody has an idea from experimental results, about the worst case
scenario.
From syscall trace, we also know that the process is not inside any
blocking
system call.
Thanks,
Ravi
