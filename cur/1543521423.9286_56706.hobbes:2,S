	The problem is that too much code makes assumptions about the structure of
'time_t'. If we're going to change that structure, we're going to break
things. So we'd either have to break current code, wait until everything
else is fixed to change it, or replace it with a new API. I strongly prefer
the third option.

	It can't be. As soon as we enlarge 'time_t', non-compliant code will break.
There's too much non-compliant code out there. I don't want to wait until
all the non-compliant code is fixed to begin working on the problem. And I
don't want to needlessly break code today that would work fine for 30+
years.
