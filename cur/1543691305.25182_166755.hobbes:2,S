No.
I didn't benchmark it at all. I'd expect one or two cycles.
The 30% difference are due to misaligned buffers: The sysvmsg ABI uses
struct msgbuf {
    unsigned long type;
    char data[];
};
msgbuf was aligned, thus data on an not 8-byte aligned address. Thus the 
"rep;movsl" microcode fastpath didn't kick in, and that caused the 
30-50% slowdown.
After manually misaligning the msgbuf structure, and properly aligning 
the kernel buffers, the performance of sysvmsg is now identical to 
pipes: Around 4 k cycles for a one-byte ping-pong, and around 10k cycles 
for 4 kB ping-pong, with a Celeron mobile 1.13 GHz.
I haven't decided yet if a patch to align the kernel buffers is a good 
thing or not - it only helps my benchmark, I'm not aware of a real-world 
app that uses sysvmsg for bulk data transfers.
