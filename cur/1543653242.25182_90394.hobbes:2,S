I couple of weeks ago I read a post from David Dillow about drivers for the
3CR990 NICs
(
http://www.3com.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=features&pathtype=purchase&s
ku=3CR990-TX-95).
Now I wonder how work is progressing as I've got a hand of one of these cards
for free :)
The current drivers from 3com (download at
http://support.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/linux/3c990-24-1.0.0a.tar.gz
) compile
but doesn't load, it only spits out:
Nov 18 14:51:58 sm-wks1 3Com  3c990.c  v1.0.0b  10/2000
Nov 18 14:52:03 sm-wks1 3c990: There appear to be inadequate resources at this
time and on this machine for this driver.  Killing further initialization.
If there will be a 2.4 backport of the driver David is writing, I'll be happy to
beta-test it for him :)
