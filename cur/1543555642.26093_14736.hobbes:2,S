As just said your patch is wrong for vanilla 2.2.18pre23.
The right fix for that problem in 2.2.18pre23 (2.2.x vanilla doesn't include
LFS) is here:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre22/lseek-2g-ext2-1
I also uploaded separately your right fix for /dev/mem:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre22/lseek-2g-mem-hjl-1

and this the right fix for the largefile handling in ext2:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.18pre22/notify-change-2g-ext2-1
