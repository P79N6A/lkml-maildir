I once complained about the s390 port not compiling because
_stext had conflicting types.
You seem to have changed include/asm/irq.h then, adding [] to it,
like it is in kernel/ksyms.c.
I just did a little grepping, And saw this:
./init/main.c:extern char _stext, _etext;
./kernel/ksyms.c:extern char _stext[], _etext[];
./include/asm-s390/irq.h:extern char _stext[];
./arch/i386/kernel/irq.h:extern char _stext, _etext;
./arch/alpha/kernel/traps.c:            extern unsigned long
_stext, _etext;
./arch/alpha/kernel/irq.h:extern char _stext;
./arch/sparc/kernel/sun4d_smp.c:                extern int
_stext;
./arch/sparc/kernel/sun4m_smp.c:                extern int
_stext;
./arch/sparc/mm/btfixup.c:extern unsigned int _stext[], _end[],
__start___ksymtab[], __stop___ksymtab[];
./arch/sparc/ap1000/timer.c:    extern int _stext;
./arch/mips/kernel/traps.c:     extern char _stext, _etext;
./arch/mips/kernel/time.c:                      extern int
_stext;
./arch/ppc/mm/init.c:extern char etext[], _stext[];
./arch/m68k/kernel/time.c:              extern int _stext;
./arch/sparc64/kernel/smp.c:            extern int _stext;
./arch/arm/kernel/setup.c:extern int _stext, _text, _etext,
_edata, _end;
./arch/arm/kernel/time.c:               extern int _stext;
./arch/arm/mm/init.c:extern char _etext, _stext, _edata,
__bss_start, _end;
As you can see, most of them don't have the [], but some do.
Others are (still?) signed or unsigned, int or long's.
I think all of them should be pointers, it doesn't make much
sense for them to be a char, altho most are just chars.
Doing the same in 2.4.0-test10, shows about the same.
What should be done with this?
