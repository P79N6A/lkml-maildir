Subject: 2.4.28 - kswapd excessive cpu usage under heavy IO

(apologies if this is sent more than once)
I've found similar incidences in the archives, but none that indicates that a
solution was found. 
I'm seeing excessive cpu usage by kswapd on a 4way 500MHZ Xeon with 2GB RAM.  A
find in a directory containing perhaps 6-700,000 files makes the box almost
grind to a halt.  In 12days uptime, kswap has used 590:43.82, and during the
find-exercise usually runs with 90-100% util.
The file-system is 150GB with JFS117 on a software-RAID5 - not exactly optimal,
I agree, but reasonably workable.
I've read that 2.6 has significant improvements in this area, but upgrading is
not currently an option.  
All hints & suggestions much appreciated.
