Yeah, the efforts from Alexander, Peter and Cyrill are fantastic.
The most positive effects of it isnt just the optimizations and code 
compression. What is important is the fact that this piece of code 
(entry_*.S) has not gotten systematic attention for a decade, and has 
become a rather crufty patchwork of hit-and-run changes. It has become 
very hard to review and it has become a reoccuring source of nasty bugs.
It is now being reworked and re-measured. It does not matter how small 
and hard to measure the gain is in one specific case - we are mainly 
concerned about not creating measurable _harm_, and we are after the 
cleanups and the increase in maintainability. Once the code is cleaner, 
improvements are much easier to do and bugs are much easier to fix.
