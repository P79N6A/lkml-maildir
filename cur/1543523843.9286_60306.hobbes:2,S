Hmmm... What card is this... eepro100?  We had the same problem as well
(no response until ethernet modules removed and reinserted) until I
patched on the same update that went into 2.2.15pre1 to the eepro100
driver (over 2.2.14), and now this has happened instead:
[sroot@worf:/root]# ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:90:27:0F:96:9B
          inet addr:209.153.___.___  Bcast:209.153.___.___  Mask:255.255.255.252
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:2147483647 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:2147483647 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:5 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100
          Interrupt:3 Base address:0x5000
eth1 is the same (stuck at ceiling and working), eth2 and eth3 haven't
gone that high yet.  PROMISC mode is set on eth0 because of an IP
accounting program I wrote that is running on the machine.
Was a counter wraparound problem fixed in the updated eepro100 driver,
perhaps?
When the problem happened on the unpatched kernel, I was able to login to
the machine from the outside (eth0) but couldn't reach anything on the
inside (via eth1).  eth0, eth2, and eth3 were still working, and only
eth1 had the 2^31-1 RX packet count.  eth0 was close, but not there yet
-- probably why it was still working.   The TX packet counter had wrapped
as in your output and it was around 150 or something (I think).
