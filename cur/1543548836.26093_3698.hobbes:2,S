actually i am porting linux on to a board previously using HCORUS operating 
sysem. That was using flat address space. I want to retain the MMU in linux. 
to set the swap size to zero, where should i configure that ? and in that 
case, what happens to KERNELBASE and KERNELLOAD - can i initialize them with 
physical addresses ?
regards,
tulika
