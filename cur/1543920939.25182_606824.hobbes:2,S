Can we get some detail as to why these north bridges have to have MSI
disabled completely?  I can't believe that all 6 of these ATI
controllers which will now be listed in the quirk table cannot use MSI
at all.
I've discovered several cases where it was a buggy device or a driver
bug that caused someone to erroneously submit patches that disable MSI
completely for the bridge they were behind.
I don't want that to happen any more.  One way to prevent that is to
have a full detailed justification for the MSI disabling in the
changelog or in the comments for the MSI quirk.
Thank you.
