Don't forget that there are benefits of not polluting the cache with the 
traffic for the incoming skbs.

Yes, that's something I'd like to try soon.

In the I/O AT case it might make sense to do a few prefetch()es of the 
userland data on the return-to-userspace code path.  Similarly, we should 
make sure that network drivers prefetch the header at the earliest possible 
time, too.

*grin*  but you could use it for such cool tasks as MFM en/decoding! =-)
