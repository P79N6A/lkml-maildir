I took them from the patched 8250_pci.c file in Jacques' previous mail:
/*
 * pci devices with appropriate class declared, but known as
 * non modems or serial
 */
static struct pci_device_id __devinitdata non_serial_pci_tbl[] = {
	{	PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M5451,
		PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0 },
	{	PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL, 0x5457,
		PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0 },
	{	PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL, 0x5459,
		PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0 },
	{ 0, }
};
