In 2.4.x, you'll get it on the stack as one of the ELF auxilliary
entries (AT_CLKTCK). 
Strictly speaking that's the "frequency at which 'times()' counts", ie
the kernel CLOCKS_PER_SEC, not HZ. But from a user perspective the two
should hopefully always be the same (if any of the /proc fields etc
should really use CLOCKS_PER_SEC, not HZ).
