Subject: [PATCH] wait_task_stopped: pass correct exit_code to wait_noreap_copyout
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In wait_task_stopped() exit_code already contains the right value for
the si_status member of siginfo, and this is simply set in the non
WNOWAIT case.
Pass it unchanged to wait_noreap_copyout();  we would only need to
shift it and add 0x7f if we were returning it in the user status field
and that isn't used for any function that permits WNOWAIT.
