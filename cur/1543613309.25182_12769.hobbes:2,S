As it requires userspace, complete realmode 16bit DOS environment, it 
should not live in kernel (due to being 16bit code, and requiring its 
own mm). There was some patch which used protected mode VESA services 
to set videomode, but as nobody uses these services, BIOSes either do 
not provide them at all, or services provided are buggy and unusable.
If VESA BIOS virtualization it is something like (debian) 'read-edid' 
package does - then please no. It prints dozens of messages to screen 
for about 2 minutes on Matrox hardware, and if you switch consoles 
during that, CRTC setting is hopelessly damaged and only starting X 
brings picture back to you. And it does not read any EDID, of course...
