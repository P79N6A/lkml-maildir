For the last few months we have had "hangs" where the machine
will respond to pings , but nothing else. After upgrading the kernel
we now get a useful message when it hangs, so I thought that
with the message and an example program perhaps someone can track this down.
The nature of the issue is with a program that execs many processes
quickly in succession on an SMP machine and these processes read the 
some of the same
files over a CIFS share. At random times the machine hangs under this load.
I created a shell script (below) that does a similar thing and can 
reliably cause the
machine to hang.
We are running:
    Linux prodeng2 2.6.17-1.2142_FC4smp #1 SMP Tue Jul 11 22:57:02 EDT
    2006 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
we get the following error:

...after googling a little, the closest similar report I find is:
    
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.xen.devel/day=20060916
To tickle this bug do:
   1. Create a CIFS  share, ideally on a  real Windows server since that
      is the current context of the issue I am reporting
   2. Run this shell script using a path to a file on the share:
file_on_cifs_mnt=$1
while true
do
# limited fork bomb...repeat until hang
c=1;
while [ $c -lt 10000 ]
do
 # cif mounted file will cause hang
 (cat $file_on_cifs_mnt > /dev/null ; ) &
 # local file won't hang me
 # (cat /etc/passwd > /dev/null ; ) &
 let c=c+1
done
wait
done
NOTE: sometimes it would hang immediately, sometimes after a time, 
sometimes I had to run 2 instances of the script concurrently to get the 
BUG.
If anyone has a fix OR a work around I would very much appreciate the help.
Thx.
