It's probably not a kernel problem.  It looks like you have inetd trying
to listen to a port that a standalone daemon is already listening to. In
this case, bind is a system call, and has nothing to do with BIND (named),
which doesn't run out of inetd anyway. 
auth/tcp is the service associated with the annoying identd daemon, so
you've probably got a bunch of in.identd processes hanging around.  If I
were you, I'd just comment that line out of /etc/inetd.conf, restart
inetd, and then kill all identd processes.  On redhat systems et. al.,
this can be accomplished by:
  killall in.identd
cheers.
