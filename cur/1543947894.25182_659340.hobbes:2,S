Subject: Should a x86 gdb work under an x86_64 kernel?

Hi,
	I've noticed that if I try to use a 32-bit x86 gdb to debug a
32-bit program under a 64-bit x86_64 kernel, gdb (version 6.6-debian,
from Ubuntu Gutsy) immediately core dumps as soon as I run the test
program under the debugger.  Is this normal/expected/known bug?
	I haven't tried bisecting it yet, but it's been broken as early
as a little after 2.6.25-rc1, in late January.  But before I spend a
large amount of time doing the bisect, I thought I'd ask if anyone has
heard of this issue.  Does this sound familiar?
