We swap pages out all of the time in 2.4.x, and that is all I was suggesting 
swap out some but not all of the pages, on a very long pte_chain.  And swapping
out a page is not terribly complex, unless something very drastic has changed.

I will agree with that if everything works so the sharing happens,
this is a nice feature.

???
Last I checked we already had those in 2.4.x, and still in 2.5.x.  The
list of place the address space is mapped.
