I wouldn't say 'very poor taste' -- just something that should be
done infrequently, with good reason, and with reasonable concensus,
especially from the key maintainers in the affected area.
Good names are good taste, in my book.  But stable naming is good too.
I wonder what Nick thinks of this?  Looks like he added
__GFP_NOMEMALLOC a year ago, following the naming style of PF_MEMALLOC.
I added him to the cc list.
