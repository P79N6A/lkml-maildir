kbuild costs go up a bit (average of 30 builds)
elapsed
non-pv: AVG=53.31s STD=0.99
pv:     AVG=53.54s STD=0.94
user
non-pv: AVG=318.63s STD=0.19
pv:     AVG=319.33s STD=0.23
system
non-pv: AVG=30.56s STD=0.15
pv:     AVG=31.80s STD=0.15
kernel side of the kbuild workload slows down by 4.1%. User time also
increases a bit (probably more cache and branch misses).

Will try to get one to do some runs on.
Thanks,
