	Same observation here (kernel 2.6.23). I can see this bug when I try to 
synchronize a raid1 volume over iSCSI (each element is a raid5 volume), 
or sometimes only with a 1,5 TB raid5 volume. When this bug occurs, md 
subsystem eats 100% of one CPU and pdflush remains in D state too. What 
is your architecture ? I use two 32-threads T1000 (sparc64), and I'm 
trying to determine if this bug is arch specific.
