No no - for 28456 calls you suffered from inability to read documentation

Go and read up on POSIX and Unix. When you've read about signal handling
and signal related issues and the fact you can control behaviours then 
come back with a possibly valid criticism
The Unix API isnt perfect. Im sure of that. But people who moan about things
it can do are wasting time when they could be moaning (and better yet fixing)
things that it cant
