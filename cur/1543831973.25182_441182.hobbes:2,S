No, no, I was commenting on your (incorrect) statement that kernel "was
patched up by introducing MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS=8". It never was: this
limit is part of the original design, not some "patch".

Because this is not needed for current pdflush usage patterns. pdflush
is used for light background write-out, and small number of pdflush
threads is able to achieve necessary IO concurrency level, because they
are mostly non-blocking, thanks to the current_is_pdflush() checks. If
asynchronous write-out cannot cope with the rate of dirtying,
synchronous write-out starts.
You, on the other hand, are trying to use pdflush for the goal it wasn't
designed for. No wonder it doesn't work.

You didn't look carefully enough. :-)
/*
 * When balance_dirty_pages decides that the caller needs to perform some
 * non-background writeback, this is how many pages it will attempt to write.
 * It should be somewhat larger than RATELIMIT_PAGES to ensure that reasonably
 * large amounts of I/O are submitted.
 */
static inline long sync_writeback_pages(void)
{
	return ratelimit_pages + ratelimit_pages / 2;
}
ratelimit_pages = 32, hence, sync_writeback_pages() returns 48. It could
be different, of course, if ratelimit_pages were.

No, I think the fewer hard-coded constants are here---the better. I'd
happily eliminate MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS, but just dropping this constraint
is a non-solution in search of a problem, obviously.
But this discussion is degenerating, so I shall participate in it no
longer.
