Yes, that.

You're getting very confused.
1. kernel is loaded.
2. firmware scans loaded kernel, finds gzip magic numbers (the compressed
   kernel.)
3. firmware sets initrd pointeres to point at the compressed kernel.
4. firmware calls kernel decompressor.
5. kernel decompresses and self-relocates.
6. compressed kernel image is thereby partly corrupted.
7. kernel boots.
8. kernel tries to decompress the compressed kernel image.
9. decompressor gets confused and tries to gobble more data than is
   available.
10. kernel sits there being a dumb fuck.

It's very simple.  With fix, the kernel successfully boots on these
machines.  Without fix, the kernel hangs on these machines for _no_
good reason other than the firmware did something that was stupid.
I'm sorry, I just do not see why you're being soo bloody difficult
over this.
The buggest bloody thing about this is that _lots_ of time was wasted
on working out what the fuck was going on.  I have no intention of
allowing any supposed "cleanup" to return us to the days where we have
to go though such crap again - and I will keep bitching about it until
the message gets through.
As far as I'm concerned, we're better off keeping the existing code if
this is the extent to which folk have to go to in order to preserve
needed bug fixes.
