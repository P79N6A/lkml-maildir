Hmm, you must have missed my report I sent to you earlier.
After a fresh reboot, I booted into the console (no X/kde started) and ran the
while looped kernel compile for a couple days.  Then I switched to single
user mode to see if the address space was recovered, but it was not.
Is there any way (I don't thing so, but...) that KDE can affect this when
there aren't any KDE processes running?
