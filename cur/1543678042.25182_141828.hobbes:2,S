/me is quite uneasy with that assumption; not that it is not
correct (it should), but I can think of cases where that does 
not need to happen (for example, if you have another FIFO/99 
task B after your user task A that depends on kernel task K0),
and that task B happens to hold it for too long for A to miss
deadlines.

I can think of a OpenOffice + sched_yield() style or a brain-damaged 
poll for previous art. It would screw the whole equation.
Another example, I changed NGPT to do spin+futex for spinlocks, 
but then it was changed back by someone to spinning again -- 
performance reasons [they said] - of course, Thou Shall Not 
Use NGPT + Real-Time (tm). But how many of these are left? I am
so scared of JVMs...
This is even more prone to happen when you have priority
inheritance ... been there, done that, SysRq+E was my friend. 
It gets uncomfortably close to the "not my problem if you don't 
know to set up your system" area, but I would really prefer that
safeguard that then I can disable manually (by prioritizing down)
if I know where to push.
