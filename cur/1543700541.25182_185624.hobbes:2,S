Yep.  After a very partial and preliminary look (ctype.h, signal.h, errno.h)
  I would recommend that SCO sue the much larger pot of Microsoft Windows
  users out there.
So far as I can tell, Visual Studio ships with these files as well, although
  I can't compare the Linux, SCO, and Windows versions of them.
Anyone with more info?
