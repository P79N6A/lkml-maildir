Not necessarily. It can lock up the bus and require a hard reset.
That's why they make some pins longer than others -- so you can get an
interrupt which lets you know it's going away a split second before it's
actually gone, and you have time to remove power from the socket and call
some kind of abort method on the driver so it knows it must never touch
the hardware again.
