Hi,
Could you please CC to david.gordon@ericsson.se ? Thank you.
I built a script to startup an IPv6 web server (Jigsaw) automatically at
boot. Jigsaw requires a java-like interpreter (jipsy) to start the web
class.  However, I get the following error message:
"Salvaging resource manager state
resource store state salvaged using 1
Salvagin resource manager state
resource store state salvaged using 25"
What does this mean ?
David Gordon
