No thanks.
Just use the process address space management as-is, and make the
vmalloc address list be the same as any other address list: it would just
be the "native" address list for "init_mm".
You could probably even use "insert_vm_struct()" directly, and have that
do the AVL tree stuff for you, no changes needed.

It's definitely not a 2.4.x thing.
