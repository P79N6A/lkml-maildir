IMO the problem with a pre-emptable kernel is that you'll increase of an
order of magnitude the possibility of races in the code. And it's not
clear to me what to do in critical section where you can't preempt a
process without risk of deadlocking (maybe because you are holding a
spinlock). If you take irq disabled while holding all spinlocks you'll be
safe of course but you'll increase irq latency...
