Anyone can send a patch.  Whether it gets applied depends on
several factors.

Depends on who you ask to merge it.  Andrew put patches into
the -mm patchset within minutes sometimes, depending on how
busy he is, what else he is doing, etc.
But it varies quite a bit by driver or subsystem maintainer.

Send it to the correct maintainer (driver or subsystem usually).
If you can't find a correct maintainer, then send it to Andrew
(akpm@osdl.org).  Maybe put "[RFC]" in the Subject: line to
get (more) comments on it.
