Hi,
  I am using Red Hat Linux6.0. When i boot my PC I get
the following message
Starting NFS statd : neighbour table Overflow
it fails to start any NFS service. I also get the
error
cannot register RPC Unable to send: errono = No buffer
Space availaible
My PC is connected to a LAN. But when the PC boots it
works fine. I am able to browse, telnet ftp.
Any clues to whats happening.
SUJIT
