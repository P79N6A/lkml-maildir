Actually its to cover the case where you have a floppy drive, and you've
booted the kernel from a floppy disk, and the kernel doesn't have the
floppy driver built in.  It turns the floppy drive off, cause there's
nothing else to do that.
Obviously putting it in the floppy driver wouldn't be meaningful.
