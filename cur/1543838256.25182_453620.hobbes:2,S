That may depend heavily on the architecture.  PA-RISC has the concept of 
spaceid's, and bits from the spaceid can be included in the hash along 
with bits from the offset.  So, it is not possible to simply match the 
offset, one has to make sure that hash bits from the spaceid hash the 
same as well.
Now, PA-RISC CPUs have the ability to disable spaceid hashing, and it is 
entirely possible that the PA-RISC linux port does that, but I thought I 
would mention it as an example.  I'm sure the "official" PA-RISC linux 
folks can expand on that much much better than I can.
