I mostly agree on this, and thought it myself (I *never* use Emacs, only Vim, 
but no flames here).
However, let's be kind with Jeff, since he's the UML maintainer. You can be 
right, but there's also courtesy.
If Jeff says "OK", then someone can submit a separate patch removing all the 
final comments.
Until then, please don't.
And never mix such unrelated changes in a patch.
