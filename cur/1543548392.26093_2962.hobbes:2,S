I agree with Ted.  If your debugger is a highly effective, easy-to-use tool,
people will use it and help you with improving it. If the distributions 
include it, then developers building software with "stable" kernels will 
use it for checking code that interacts with their kernels in ways that 
cause trouble.  This would be very valuable.
This means you get to focus on supporting released kernels.  This might be 
a viable way for you to build a user base.  This could eventually lead to 
use with the development kernel and the growth of support for keeping 
the debugger in sync with the kernel's architectural changes.
I am a Linux tester, not a kernel developer, so this is 
"for what it's worth."
