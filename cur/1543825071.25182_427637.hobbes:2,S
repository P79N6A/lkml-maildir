Hello,
I want to ask, if there is any function to call (as we debated with Jeff), which
does something like this:
1) I have some vendor/device ids in table
2) I want to traverse raws of the table and compare to system devices, and if
found, stop and return pci_dev struct (or raw in the table).
I have this code for the time being:
static struct pci_device_id ids[] = {
    { PCI_DEVICE(0x1234, 0x4321) },
    /* ... whatever ... */
    { 0 }
};
for (id = ids; id->vendor; id++) {
  d = pci_get_device(id->vendor, id->device, NULL);
  if (d != NULL) {
    /* get some info */
    pci_dev_put(d);
    break;
  }
}
I'm searching for a bus or something, which is only one in the system, but would
be made by more vendors.
Simply, something like pci_dev_present(), but with a result of pci_dev or index
of the raw in the ids table corresponding to the found device (instead of
returning 0/1).
thanks,
