Actually...this is also related to how the controller reports the error. 
If it reports a device level death/failure rather than a read error, Linux 
is just taking that on face value.  Yup, it should retry though.  Other 
possibilities exist including the volume going offline at the controller 
level, having nothing to do with Linux, this is most often the problem I 
see with RAIDs.
