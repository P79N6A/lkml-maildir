there is no problem at all with Apache. Wake-one does not need any
application-side change, this is a common misconception. [Apache does
provide an optimization to avoid OS-level accept() inefficiencies, but
that is a different issue and it can be turned on/off freely.] The
wake-one implementation in 2.3 works automatically and works just fine.
