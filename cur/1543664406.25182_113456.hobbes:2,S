The thing is, on sparc64, these pointers were cast to u32's, so the
struct was only 12 bytes instead of the current 24. Dave's concern is
the doubling of this pretty large array.
What you could do is allow each architecture to define the ioctl_trans
struct, and also macros for acessing and setting each member. That would
probably satisfy this special cases.

If you make the change that Dave suggests, it will be fixed :) Even with
this patch, sparc64 is still broken for modules (like alsa and ieee1394)
that register conversions on load.
