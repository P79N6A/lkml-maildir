Hello Renato,
I understand that this is possible, but would not be possible to
generate one .config of modules that are running to compile a kernel
optimized?
The idea is that the kernel of my distribution is too fat and I only
generate a kernel module that I use automatically from a kernel fat.
understand?
I thank in advance.
