    Ho hum.  It's up to the hordes of scheduler hackers really.  If they
    want, and can agree upon a patch then go wild.  It should be against
    -mm minus staircase, as there's a fair amount of scheduler stuff
    banked up for post-2.6.8.
The patch exists for both -mm2 and -mm1, but I've been holding off
posting it until I get a chance to do more than simply compile it.
Our lab machines are back up now so I'll test a (-mm2 - staircase)
patch this afternoon.
