That's _exactly_ why you need the _real_ kernel headers and not what
glibc _thinks_ are kernel headers. I just had this argument today w/
some Debian people (Debian has /usr/include/linux as glibc stuff and
i'm on a RH having /usr/include/linux pointing in the kernel source ---
IMHO _rightfully_).
Florian.
