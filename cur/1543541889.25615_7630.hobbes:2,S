Hi,
On this laptop (Armada 7360DMT), a user suspend screws up the current
console. 
After it resumes, all keys are non-functional (they either do nothing, or
it thinks that enter is pressed).
It looks like the keyboard is in raw mode or something like that. Console
switching works fine, and on other consoles the keyboard is fine.
The machine runs on kernel 2.2.17pre18
	Regards,
		Igmar
