RFC1122 compliant reporting does not really make too much sense with
IP_RECVERR because you never know where the error came from. The only
reason to keep the report-all-errors-without-connect linux policy
would be backwards compatibility to older Linux. I think using sysctls
for such application private things are the wrong approach, because they're 
too global and fix one thing and break another.  So on further thought
it is probably best to keep the current 2.4 behaviour and fix applications
to use IP_RECVERR as appropiate.
