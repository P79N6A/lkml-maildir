Hello,
I use RedHat 6.2 with 2.2.16 kernel and 4 NICs in my lab at school.
3 of NICs are private network 172.x.x.x, and the other is public 140.o.o.o
But when I use this box, I got following messages...
card3: response no resource
card3: Too much work at interrupt, status = 0x4050
card2: response no resource
card2: Too much work at interrupt, status = 0x4050
Could you give me a hint? Thanks a lot.
Cheers,
Tom
