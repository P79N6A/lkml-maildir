 I failed to track down a single 486 SMP system that would adhere to the 
MP spec.  There were and possibly still are APIC-based 486 SMP systems out 
there, but most likely they are not Intel MPS-compliant, by not providing 
the MP header at the very least.  Thus Linux would have to be ported and I 
gather the interest in doing so is epsilon.
 Myself, I could not resist trying an APIC-based 486 SMP box and possibly 
fixing issues if I found one and it was MPS-compliant, but nothing beyond 
that I would say.  Life's too short.
