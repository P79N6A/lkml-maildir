That's unfortunate considering we did cure the DRM cases :-)
My only thought is that virt_to_bus() and friends are a special case
because they mean compilation failure on most non-x86 platforms.
And frankly, __deprecated serves a different purpose as far as I'm
concerned.  It let's people working on stuff outside the tree know
that "oops you shouldn't be using that interface".
The deprecated warnings are so easy to filter out, so I don't think
noise is a good argument.  I see them all the time too.
The whole DMA API we have today was added 4+ years ago specifically
to get rid of virt_to_bus() and friends.  It's been mostly successful,
but one last nudge like this deprecation marking might help get us over
the edge and finally delete the thing for good. :-)
Anyways, my 2cents.
