The text I'm using for telling people how to bisect is:
<--  snip  -->
# install git and cogito on your computer
# clone Linus' tree:
cg-clone \ 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
# start bisecting:
cd linux-2.6
git bisect start
git bisect bad v2.6.21
git bisect good v2.6.20
cp /path/to/.config .
# start a round
make oldconfig
make
# install kernel, check whether it's good or bad, then:
git bisect [bad|good]
# start next round
After at about 12 reboots you'll have found the guilty commit
("...  is first bad commit").
More information on git bisecting:
  man git-bisect
<--  snip  -->
Is this text understandable?
If not, what is missing?
