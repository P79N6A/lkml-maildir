Subject: NFS Lockd Kernel Patch Proposal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following file includes patch to export set/reset capabilityes of the
grace period to user-level via the proc filesystem.
Traces of the need for this feature were included in the code but the code
was not actually included so this should not be
big news to the previous writers of the lockd code.
I will appreciate this to be considered for inclusion in the kernel
distribution. This feature is an enabler for HA-NFS.
(See attached file: svc.c)
