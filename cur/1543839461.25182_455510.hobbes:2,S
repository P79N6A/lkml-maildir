Hardly.  The _GPL is a hint as to the intent of the author, but it is no 
more than a hint.
My intent here (and I think the intent of the other authors) is not to 
cause breakage of things which currently work, so the _GPL is not 
appropriate for that reason.  Paravirt_ops is a restatement of many 
interfaces which already exist in Linux in a non-_GPL form, so making 
the structure _GPL is effectively relicensing them.
