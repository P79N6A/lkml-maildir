uidx is an index, starting from which there are unread entries. It is
updated by userspace when it commits entries, so it is 'consumer'
pointer, while kidx is an index where kernel will put new entries, i.e.
'producer' index. We definitely need them both.
Userspace can only update (implicitly by calling kevent_commit()) uidx.
