Well, where "properly" means "conforming to the ACPI spec". If _GTF is 
there, it's meant to be called. The _GTF buffer contents can potentially 
vary depending on BIOS settings, so there's no way for Linux to know 
what the correct commands to send are. And since _GTF responses can also 
depend on the information passed to _SDD, it's necessary to support that 
as well.

I was under the impression that ICH5 and ICH6 in non-AHCI mode didn't 
generate any sort of hotswap interrupt. This gets around that.
