How about the really simple so-obvious-its-impossible-to-misread  
solution?
par->PanelDispCntlRegRead = !blank_mode;
Personally I tend to get ?: constructs confused a _lot_, especially  
mistaking the really short ones like x?0:1 and x?1:0.  Those two are  
usually better represented as !x or !!x, respectively.
