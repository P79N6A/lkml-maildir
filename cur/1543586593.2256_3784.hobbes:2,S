Subject: How to make ramdisk based system?

Please forgive me that this is not exactly a kernel question.
I'm trying to figure out how to make a primaryly ram-disk based
Linux system (which should then be able to access "real" storage,
but that is really the last step).
Could some kind soul please point me to a HOWTO or cookbook how
to build such a system (there are boot/root floppy systems around,
but I cannot figure out how to create them or something similar,
and "live filesystem" CDs seem to be no longer en vogue)?
Many thanks,
 Steffen
