Greg, there will always be stupid people who don't understand the work
of others. These are the same type of people who won't understand at all
why there's a -stable branch. When I started 2.4-hf, I've been told
"you're dumb, 2.4 is dead". I'm very glad that you take care of people
who cannot easily upgrade to latest version, and I'm sure that a lot of
users are too.
