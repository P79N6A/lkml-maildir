blk_get_queue() is easy to 'fix', it grabs io_request_lock for no good
reason at all. I think this must have been a failed attempt to protect
switching of queues, however it's obviously very broken in this regard.
So in fact no skin is off our nose for just removing the io_request_lock
in that path. 2.5 will have it properly reference counted...

Sure is, the bio patches have not had io_request_lock in them for some
time.
