Hi,
Mike Fedyk:

Such encoding isn't valid UTF-8.
Of course you could use ⁄ instead (fractional slash, U+2044).
Or perhaps ∕ (division slash, U+2215).
How to visually distinguish these from a / (U+002F) is left as an
exercise to the reader.  :-/
The fun part about this email is that I'm writing it with plain old vi
(ummm.... I _do_ know that there's nothing "plain old" about vim ;-)
and I don't see silly square boxes here.
