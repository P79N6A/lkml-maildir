The problem was definitely in the exit_notify code, where it manipulated
the task links indefinitely.  (I think it was cptr never becomes null,
so the loop never terminates).
However, if we're saying that "pid1 must not die" then maybe we should get
rid of the 'killall' sysrq option since it serves no useful purpose, and
add a suitable panic in the do_exit path?
I'll generate a patch for that if there's interest.
