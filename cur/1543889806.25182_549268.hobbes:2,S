correct.

2 physical CPUs can't select the same VCPU at the same time.
i.e. VCPU can be running on 1 PCPU only at the moment.
and vice versa: PCPU can run only 1 VCPU at the given moment.
So serialization is done when we need to assign VCPU to PCPU moment only,
not when we select a particular task from the runqueue.
About the contention: you can control how often VCPUs should be rescheduled,
so the contention can be quite small. This contention is unavoidable in any fair
scheduler since fairness implies across CPUs accounting and decision making at least
with some period of time.
Well it is possible to avoid contention at all - if we do fair scheduling
separately on each CPU. But in this case we still do user-based balancing
(which requires serialization) and precision can be nasty.

load balancing is done taking into account *current* VCPUs assignments to PCPUs.
i.e. sched domains are taken into account.
nothing is introduces at schedule() time - not sure what you meant actually by this.

by default every user is given num_online_cpus() VCPUs, i.e. it can
run on all physical CPUs at the same time. If needed a user can be limited.

yes.

yes. but for user space this has no any implications. You see, there is no way for user space
to determine whether it is "-truly simultaneously- running on /same/ cpu 0".

very simple imho.
the only way from user space to get some task CPU id is /proc.
All you need is to return *some* value there.
For example, one can report PCPU id to which VCPU is assigned.

if there is no high load - tasks will be running on different PCPUs
as the author was planning, since VCPUs will get different PCPUs for sure.
Otherwise - it is not performance critical, and moreover *controversial* to *fairness*.
Let me provide an example why binding is controversial to fairness.
Imagine that we have 2 USERs - USER1 and USER2 and 2 CPUs in the system.
USER1 has 50 tasks binded to CPU0 and 50 tasks binded to CPU1.
USER2 has 1 task.
Let USER2 to be as important as USER1 is, so these USERs should
share summary CPU time as 1:1.
How will it work with your approach?

sure. The "perfect" solution doesn't exist :( So I would be happy to know Ingo
opinion as well.
