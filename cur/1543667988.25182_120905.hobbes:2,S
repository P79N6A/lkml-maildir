Zlib compression is used in many places in the kernel, cramfs, jffs2,
squashfs, zisofs, cloop, ppp, maybe more.
There used to be several copies of the code in the kernel tree, I
still have a not-so-old compiled kernel with *three* copies of the
zlib code in it. It's centralized now under lib/, which is a good
thing (TM).
When configuring the kernel, chances are you don't have to touch it.
Anything else should be reported and get fixed. :)
