Alan,
I just tried 2.4.20-pre5-ac1 on my Gigabyte 8IGX 845G chipset board.
I have the same problem as reported previously. No IDE drives when
booting 2.4.20pre5-ac1, but drives do appear when booting
2.4.20-pre1-ac1. I don't know if
you or Andre have begun to sort it out yet, but maybe someone else
can 
report in who is using another 845G board to see if my problem is 
unique or not.
Dmesg snippets below, full http links to dmesg,lspci, kernel 
config at the end of the message. I will also  try on my 
Gigabyte 8IEX 845E chipset board later.  If it works I will report
in.
2.4.20pre1ac1 works great. (ide-scsi, DVD viewing etc)
I'm running stock RedHat 7.3 all updates. No binary proprietary
drivers
were built, intalled etc for 2.4.20pre5ac1.
Thanks for all the work you and the rest of the IDE team are doing.
Tony
(If I'm doing something stupid let me know)
