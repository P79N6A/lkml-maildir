Yeah, it turns out that x86 is doing
+k8-y                      += ../../x86_64/kernel/k8.o
which I failed to spot.  This, along with the "amd64" in the name fooled me
into believing that x86 wasn't supposed to be using this code.
x86_64 uses numerous x86 files in this manner, and now we we have x86 using
a couple of x86_64 files in a siilar manner.  I think this is a bad thing,
and that we should make all these cross-references operate in the same
direction rather than in both directions.  x86_64 developers already have
to deal with this problem, so why make start burdening x86 developers also?
Anyway.  Andi, I'll drop x86_64-mm-new-northbridge-fix.patch.  Please add
these exports to your copy of x86_64-mm-new-northbridge.patch
