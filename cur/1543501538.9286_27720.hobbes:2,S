This is something that I've been thinking about. One thing that I
don't like about LD_PRELOAD is that it's indiscriminant. There's no
control.
I propose a system-wide and per-user configuration file that can be
used to specify extra shared libraries to load. Part of the syntax
would be to limit the extra libraries based on argv[0]. Then various
"interesting" functions in libc would call "known" symbols in these
extra libraries.
An alternative is that "interesting" functions in libc allow the
application to register overload functions. Each interface function
(i.e. open(), stat() and so on) would call the overload function
first. If that fails, the next overload function is called (yep, a
stack). Finally, the internal implementation is called if none of the
overload functions succeed.
You can even set it up so that if an overload function calls the
calling interface function, the next overload function is called.
I've implemented the overloading technique in one of my libraries, and
it works really well.

The unwashed masses have discovered the ivory tower ;-)
