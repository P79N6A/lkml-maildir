I think the drive just takes too long to recongize the disc. My 4163B has
the same problem which is why I always close the tray manually or with
eject -t and wait a while before mounting or burning the disc. Of course
that won't help in your case. I guess the real fix would be to
increase some ide-cd timeout.
