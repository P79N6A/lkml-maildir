I heartily approve of this; and yes, it's the per-arch one which should
go (since its "alignment" looks nasty).  But there's a lot more arches
than just x86 which should be fixed (and so rather more work, preparing
those patches for the various maintainers) - is that something you'd
have time to do?  (Don't worry, "No" is a perfectly fair answer, and
it's no way essential that all change at once.)
Thanks,
Hugh
