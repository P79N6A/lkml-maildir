A fatal signal is placed to ->shared_pending in any (non tkill) case, so I
think it is not lost (but may be unnoticed for a while).
sig_kernel_coredump() is different. It could be stealed by one of sub-threads
while another one does de_thread(), that is why it could be lost.
What do you think about something like this untested patch instead?
I am far from sure it is correct, I need a sleep ...
Oleg.
