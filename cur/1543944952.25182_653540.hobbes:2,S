i wonder if these #ifdef's are really needed at all, even if one doesn't
use -fstack-protector, having the code set up the canary has like 0
performance impact. not to mention that i think the change in switch_to
means that it won't compile without CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR enabled and
instead of making that macro conditional it's just a lot easier to enable
the canary all the time.
