Hmm.  This comment should be a little more forceful than a suggestion
to make ti clear you have made that change somewhere in this
patch.

Call it negative for failure, or possibly nonzero.  !0 == 1  Which
isn't what you meant, and is confusing comparing it to the code.
Ok.  This is likely me limit of picking on your patches for tonight.

Setting desc->irq just before set_irq_msi appears redundant here.
