Nick,
	Putting some more pressure I finally saw the awaited behaviour from np
: rss gaining 1MB (or at least 1 byte :) : top reports 10M -> 11M )
directly after make was done with 10 threads.
But I guess it can do much better than that (IOW recover original rss).
Where does re-attribution takes place in np ?
Regards,
FabF
