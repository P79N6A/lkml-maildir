One suggestion would be to have a set of man pages included in the
kernel tree.  And try to make them sufficiently useful that people
would want to keep them up to date.  In this case, I think adding to
the kernel tree would be a good thing, because it keeps the
documentation in the same place as what it is documenting.  I'd be
willing to write man pages for a few things myself.  The current
documentation in the kernel tree is a bit too informal and incomplete.
Maybe have a lower volume mailing list just for people in the kernel
maintainers file (and require all maintainers to subscribe), used just
for announcing/discussing kernel API changes.
Part of it could be just encouraging an attitude of sensitivity to
compatibility issues.  I don't think I'll convince anyone who doesn't
already appreciate the value of that.
