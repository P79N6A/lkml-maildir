Wouldn't this be solvable by giving userspace a way of invalidating
a range of mmapped pages?  I.e. a "minvalidate();" to use when
the other node tells you it is about to write?
This will cause the pages to be paged in again on next reference,
or you can issue a read in advance if you believe you'll need them.
