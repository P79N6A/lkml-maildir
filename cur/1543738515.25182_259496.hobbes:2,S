Well... it doesn't work on paul's laptop, but anyway, ok, let's go for
the struct thing and forget about this for 2.6.9.
Now paul and I are trying to figure out what to put in that struct and
what kind of information actually make any sense. It's not trivial. We
have to deal with several things.
We have the system state (cause of the request if you prefer), that is
"idle" (we mostly don't implement that one yet but it's useful to make
"room" for it, handhelds wants that badly), "suspend to ram" and
"suspend to disk".
But what about user /sysfs originated requests ? (that is random numbers
the user whacks in /sys/devices/...../power) what are their semantics ?
Also, do we carry around a "suggested" D state for what it means ? it's
really an obscure PCI concept. However, as you can see with the hacks
in drivers like radeonfb, we would be happy to be able to tell the
driver wether the chip will be leaved alone, powered off, unclocked,
etc... so the driver can take the right decision vs. what it supports.
That would mean, at least for PCI, a kind of platform hook that provides
that information, and in what form ? a D state ? I would vote for a
simple PCI specific pci_* (no good name comes to mind at the moment)
that would provide the platform suggested D state based on the pci_dev
and the struct we pass.

Ok, ok ... well, it's broken with your "fix" for paul's box, but it's
ok, the ppc suspend-to-disk code isn't upstream yet anyway.

Paul and I would love do the right thing, it's just difficult to define
what the right thing is at this point. Actually, I have a pretty good
idea for a lot but what happens via /sysfs...

Agreed.
