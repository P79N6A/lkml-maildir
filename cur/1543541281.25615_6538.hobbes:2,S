Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0-test6 netfilter and aic7xxx issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

2.4.0-test6 has various multiply-exported symbols associated with
the netfilter code.  Patch not included, because the intent of the
authors isn't clear, i.e., are we trying to move the EXPORT_SYMBOL()
calls into or out of netsyms.c?  The fix is straightforward enough
once the direction is clear: the involved source files (so far)
include "net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_ftp.c" and
"net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c".
The aic7xxx driver has contained a small type-thinko for the past
several kernel versions.  The driver compiles fine with MMAPIO
undefined, which probably explains how this went undetected for as
long as it did.
