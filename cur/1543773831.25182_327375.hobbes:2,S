Ahh, it seems I misread your earlier e-mail! In any case, I'll add those to
the list of missing features.

Yeah, I'm not sure how high a priority chflags are right now. Keeping in
mind that I'm mostly ignorant of cifs / samba, is there a particular set of
attributes there that it likes to use?
I'll have to look into why we don't currently support readpages /
writepages. I'm guessing it boiled down to lack of developer time :)
