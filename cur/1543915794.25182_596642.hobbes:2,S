Well, I temporarily added a key field, which is only used to store the

I'll pull/build this and test my migration problem there.  All I have to
do is to add a nice 19 chew-max to my make -j2, and all hell breaks
loose.  Always suspecting myself first in the search for dirty rotten

I'm not the SOB this time.. it got much worse, with max Xorg latency of
>500ms.
