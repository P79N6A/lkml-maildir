AFAIK, ia64 creates nodes just depends on SRAT's possible resource information.
Then, ia64 can create cpu-memory-less-node(node with no available resource.).
(*)I don't like this.
If we don't allow memory-less-node, we may have to add several codes for cpu-hot-add.
cpus should be moved to nearby node at hotadd .
And node-hot-add have to care that cpus mustn't be added before memory, cpu-driven 
node-hot-add will never occur. (ACPI's 'container' device spec can't guaranntee this.)
