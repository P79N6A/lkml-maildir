The first question would be, patches between the current kernel and 
what? Vendor kernel, people may not have it. Kernel.org kernal, just the 
patches to a current vendor kernel diff would be pretty huge in some cases.
Let's say it looks like a high cost/benefit ratio, would be much less 
effective unless it were used for every patch, and feels like something 
you might want to do within an organization rather than as a general 
practice.
Sorry, you asked for comments...
