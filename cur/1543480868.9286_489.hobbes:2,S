Hi!
Partly out of interest, and partly for a production OS choice, I have
decided to do a comparison of FreeBSD against Linux. I would like whatever
input/opinions can be thrown at me before I begin.
Here is the hardware I plan on testing with (My home PC)
Dual P II - 300mhz
256mb RAM
Adaptec 2940U2W SCSI adapter
3com 10BT network card
Diamond Stealth II G460 AGP graphics
Seagate Cheetah 9.1G U2W SCSI HDD
IOMega Jaz 
Wangdate 4mm DAT backup
Pioneer CD-ROM
Yamaha CDRW
FDD
Soundblaster 16
Erm, I think that's all I've got in it. Most of these components won't be
used and shouldn't make a difference in comparisons...
Anyway; here's my game plan. Install Linux (I need distro suggestions, but
slackware would be my first choice) on a jaz disk. Install FreeBSD (prolly
3.0-RELEASE) on a second Jaz disk. Test/time the crap out of both os's
and report which won on each test. I plan to do a few variations to see
how different variables affect the times. For example, I will pull 1 CPU
for one set of tests or run non-SMP kernels, whichever (I doubt it makes a
diff) I want to primarily test web server performance and database
performance, but I have no ideas what else might give a better overall
picture. 
Right now I am in the planning stage, and totally open to suggestions. 
I am really interested in:
a) test suites
b) benchmarking programs
c) some way to load/evaluate the response under load.
Whatever suggestions could be offered would be a great help.
Thanks
-Michael
