The current Mellanox InfiniBand driver goes to some trouble to mark
the memory being registered with VM_DONTCOPY.  This means the vmas
don't get copied into the child of a fork(), so the COW doesn't
happen.  However, this certainly leads to some quirks in semantics.
In particular, an application using fork() has to be careful that
registered memory doesn't share a page with something the child
process wants to use.
I don't think copying all the registered memory on fork() is feasible,
because it's going to kill performance (especially since exec() is
likely to immediately follow the fork() in the child).  Also, there
may not be enough memory around to copy everything.
Out of curiousity, what happens if I fork with pending AIO in the
current kernel?
