there would be a couple of natural objects to group events by:
	1) callsite [IP] of kmalloc()/kfree()/etc.
	2) slab cache
	3) slab object
for 1) callsite based histograms, i think ftrace should have a built-in 
mechanism for that. kmemtrace tracepoints already pass in a call_site 
argument that can be used to drive it.
for 2) slab cache based histograms (counts) - we need some knowledge about 
the affected slab caches, and we need some space as well. The tracepoints 
could be extended with a kmem_cache argument perhaps. A callback is needed 
at cache creation time (which could be in the form of a tracepoint) that 
gives kernel/tracing/kmemtrace.c the right place to allocate the per slab 
histogram. (so that the other tracepoints dont have to do it implicitly - 
which would be fragile as we are in the SLAB code, often with spinlocks 
taken, so we cannot allocate)
i think 3) is the hardest so lets skip it for now ;-)
