People do not expect this - since the Kbuild filename is not used expect in
the top-level directory.
So as a principle of minimum suprise I left the old Makefile as-is,
and introduced the new Kbuild file.
If xfs people likes it different then they can change it anytime.
If I one day start my little "kbuild file parser to a single makefile" project
it may be the day where we do the transition.
