i did that simply to make those initializations *consistent* across
all of the other dozen or so semaphore.h files that *do* explicitly
initialize that structure member (as you point out, for no good
reason).  i'm just as happy to whack out all of those useless
initializations, though, and submit another patch.  either way works
for me.
