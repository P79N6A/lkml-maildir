Well they do! It's just not allowed for us (the users) to know that they
__didn't__ run completely out of power!  If the thing is so dead
that it won't recharge, it still has 'power' (enough to keep static RAM
alive). Just remove the battery, wait about 120 seconds for a capacitor
to discharge,  and, zap, no more stored phone numbers. Static RAM with
an electrolytic capacitor, isolated with a diode, takes so little power
that you can normally change defective batteries if you don't take
too long.

Correct!
