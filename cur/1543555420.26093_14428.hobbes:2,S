Just "off", i.e. as soon as it should start entering standby or hibernation,
it powers off directly, leaving the system in a bad, bad state :o(
I stress that it (seemed it) worked fine with 2.2.16, and that I didn't
change my config scripts (/etc/sysconfig/apm*) until then. But with
2.2.17, I have random power-off instead of clean standby/hibernate.
