frankly, such systems are rare, and are an afterthought at most. Think 
about it: 8 CPUs and only one hres timer source? It cannot work nor 
scale well.
i agree that they might eventually be handled (although i think we 
shouldnt bother, all sane SMP designs have per-CPU timers), but we 
definite wont design for them. What such an architecture has to do is to 
provide the proper do_hr_timer_int() and arch_hrtimer_reprogram() 
semantics, via locking around that timer source (naturally), and via 
cross-CPU calls - as if they were per-CPU timers.
