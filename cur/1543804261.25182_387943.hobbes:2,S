This patch has nothing to do with vfsmount references and doesn't hide 
anything. It just adds syncronization barrier between do_umount() and 
shrink_dcache() since the latter can work with dentries/inodes without 
holding locks.
So if you think there is something wrong with it, please, be more specific.
