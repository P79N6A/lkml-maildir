True.  You can trick the MMU into faulting into the kernel (PaX does
this to apply non-executable pages-- pages, not halves of VM-- on x86),
but it's orders of magnitude slower as I understand and the petty gains
you can get over the hardware MMU doing it are not going to outweigh it.

Yeah, only exception being if L1 and L2 are both physically addressed,
and thing like libc's .text are shared, leading to shared working sets
in I1 and L2.
