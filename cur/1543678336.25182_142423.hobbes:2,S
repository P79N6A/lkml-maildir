IDE seems like a great example, thanks. In this sense each NIC on the 
host then (more especially slower ones like 100Mbps NICs) is something 
of a sync point relative to the IDE channel. Very good image indeed!!! I 
will redo the patch shortly with just a single lock. Most hosts have 
just a single NIC anyway and the argument for saving space is compelling 
too!! I suppose based on the NIC being the sync point it could be argued 
that I should check and then use literally a lock per NIC, but I'm not 
going to make this argument. Simpler (especially to start with) is just 
better by me. :-) As is saving space. :-)
As for the disease... personally I just didn't even begin to understand 
what you've explained until now. I suspect others who're suffering were 
just thinking - as I did - that these were in simplistic terms just 
logically independent queues and so deserved logically independent 
locks. The cache line problem seems like an entirely seperate problem 
that has its very own merits (ie. is arguably reason enough to have just 
the single lock).
Maybe there's a good place to add some cautionary comments about this if 
it's not somewhere already (like under 
Documentation/block/request_queue.txt)??? That's just a thought 
though... I'd like to just focus on NBD myself. ;-)
