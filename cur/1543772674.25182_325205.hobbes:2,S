Which i2c patch please? The changes I made should not cause any trouble
to V4L drivers. If they do this is a bug, please report it as such.
Also, a comment on your patch (which I didn't actually review, as I do
not feel qualified to do so):
> +#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,0)
> +#include "tuner.h"
> +#include "i2c-compat.h"
> +#else
> +#include <media/tuner.h>
> +#endif
No such test please, it is useless. This is Linux 2.6.x, no need to
check this.
