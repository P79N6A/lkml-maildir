Hi,
I would like to inform you that Max Berger (max-berger@usa.net) and me
(geier@psi5.com, in case the rewriting rules don't work) have just started
working on implementing ACPI into the Linux kernel. Unfortunately, we
don't have an own WWW/CVS server yet, but I hope to get this settled
during the next week.
