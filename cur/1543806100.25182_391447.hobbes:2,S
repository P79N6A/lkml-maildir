(the way you sent this patch means that it's not possible to reply
inline to the patch. Please fix your mailer for this)
I would hope TSS and such remain in the kernel static space, because
those are the kind of things I'd like to be read only over time...
Also the last chunk of your patch has nothing to do with what you
describe here... and seems sort of suprious. (it might be a useful
cleanup, but it should be independent)
