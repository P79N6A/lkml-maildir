But from a user perspective, how one is supposed to identify between 2
identical burners named D: and E: on their system if cdrecord only
provides b,t,l naming and "b,t,l to cd burner name" mapping?
The "OS specific to b,t,l" mapping is clearly lacking although
cdrecord knows it there as well. Cf. scsi-wnt.c:
#ifdef _DEBUG_SCSIPT
        js_fprintf(scgp_errfile,  "SPTI: Adding drive %c: (%d:%d:%d)\n", 'A'+i,
                                        pDrive->ha, pDrive->tgt, pDrive->lun);
#endif
