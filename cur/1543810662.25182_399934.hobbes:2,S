How do I remove a kernel thread in kernel mode ?
I write a C-function in one of the Linux source files and create a
kernel thread by invoking kernel_thread() to run the function, like:
"kernel_thread(a1, NULL, CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGNAL);"
Function a1 simply invokes printk() to output some message on console.
I invoke do_exit(0); at the end of a1, but a1's task_struct still
exists in in task_struct list after its execution.
How do I remove it a1's task_struct upon its completion? I thought
explicitly invoke do_exit() ensures the removal of task_struct?
