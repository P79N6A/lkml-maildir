I've had a couple of problems with framebuffer console, when 
compiling several different versions of the 2.5 kernel.  I 
included all the FB support, but when I boot up using, LILO 
option, vga=791 or anything about normal, the screen either 
goes black, and the system stops responding or the entire 
screen becomes scrambled.  I have an NVidia Geforce4 video 
card if that matters.  I've talked to a couple other users 
who have encountered the same problem.  It's most likely just 
a stupid mistake on my part, but any help would be extremely 
appreciated.
Thank you.
