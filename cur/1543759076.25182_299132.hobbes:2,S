It depends on what you call a "user visible API".
Changes which are visible to userspace are treated with great caution
nowadays[*].  I keep on rejecting patches...
Changes which are visible to third-party kernel modules are more
acceptable, but we're still fairly reluctant to make them.
So I think you exaggerate.  And I don't see that the problem which you
describe is inevitably a part of the "new 2.6 way".
[*] I don't know any details of the /proc incompatibility which davej
    mentions, and I'd like to.  That sounds like a screw-up.
