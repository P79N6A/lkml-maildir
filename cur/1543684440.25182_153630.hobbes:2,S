Hello,
In the last few days I read some security advisories about security
patches for Linux Kernels of the 2.4-series which have been published by
various distributors. 
Does anybody know of a URL where such fixes for the stable Kernel 2.4.21
can be found? The best place would be a place where always actual kernel
security fixes can be found and where, if the patches are already
integrated into the kernel, it contains no other differences from the
stable release.
Thanks
  Christoph
