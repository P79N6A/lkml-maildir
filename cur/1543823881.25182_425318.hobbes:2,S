Not quite. udelay is a macro on ARM so this ends up as an integer before
it ever hits a function call. In an ideal world I'd use "ndelay(40);"
but that would result in a delay of over 1µs as ARM doesn't have ndelay
defined so we hit the generic fallback.

This format is used throughout the drivers/mtd/nand/ directory. I'd
suggest it'd be more appropriate to have a separate patch that did this
for all of them if it's desired, rather than having each driver do its
own thing.
Agreed on all the spacing comments you raised; hangovers from toto.c
that I used as a base.
