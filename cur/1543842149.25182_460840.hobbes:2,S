Your patch has this in it too:
/* 
 * We check for constant values with __builtin_constant_p() since 
 * it's not interesting to profile them, and there is a compiler 
 * bug in gcc 3.x which blows up during constant evalution when 
 * CONFIG_PROFILE_LIKELY is turned on. 
 */ 
#define likely(x)       (__builtin_constant_p(x) ? (!!(x)) : __check_likely((x), 1)) 
#define unlikely(x)     (__builtin_constant_p(x) ? (!!(x)) : __check_likely((x), 0)) 
Could you define "blows up"? My reading of the text above is: "this code
below makes sure it does work with gcc 3.x as well".
Now I used gcc 3.4.1 and get random memory corruptions while with gcc 4.1.1
everything seems to be ok....
