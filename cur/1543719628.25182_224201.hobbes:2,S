It would be nice to have keyboard in kernel because that means
keyboard works even on heavilly overloaded system, in case of oops
etc. (Unfortunately steps back were already taken; console switching
is no longer so robust w.r.t. kernel crashes :-( ).
Are you able to provide accurate timestamps for input events from
userland?
