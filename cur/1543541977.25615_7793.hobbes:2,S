Actually that does make more sense. And yes, this could be a problem.
But if we are going to call out every SMP problem in the USB drivers, we
would have a long list :)
David Brownell's recent patch for the dc2xx driver shows what needs to
be done to the drivers that don't have mechanisms to protect their
internal data structures and urbs from reentrancy. Do you want me to go
through the driver code to get a feel of which drivers have problems?
Hopefully I get a SMP box soon...
