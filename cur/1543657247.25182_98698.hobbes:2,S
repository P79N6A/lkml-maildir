I suspect Valgrind could use this too at some point.  There hasn't been
much discussion about it yet, but I think Valgrind may well move towards
a more complete virtualization in a later round of development, and
isolating the virtual virtual address space from the Valgrind's real
virtual address space would be very useful.  (Jeff suggested the idea of
merging Valgrind and UML at some level, which does raise some
interesting possibilities.)
