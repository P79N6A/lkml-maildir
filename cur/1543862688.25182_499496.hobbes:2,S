"ping6 -I eth0 ff02::1" worked fine for 2.6.20-rc3, with both Linux
systems on the link responding.  Somewhere in either -rc4 or -rc5 this
quit working.
"tcpdump -i eth0 -l -n ip6" on the remote (same link) Linux system shows
the icmp6 echo request going out on the wire, but no one responds.
One host is running 2.6.20-rc4, the other -rc5.  The results are the
same no matter which direction the test is run.
