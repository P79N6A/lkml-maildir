Hello Linus, my name is Rick Jones. I am the person at Hewlett-Packard
who drafted the "so _obviously_ stupid" sendfile() interface of HP-UX.
Some of your critique (quoted above) found its way to my inbox and I
thought I would introduce myself to you to give you an opportunity to
expand a bit on your criticism. In return, if you like, I would be more
than happy to describe a bit of the history of sendfile() on HP-UX.
Perhaps (though I cannot say with any certainty) it will help explain
why HP-UX sendfile() is spec'd the way it is.
