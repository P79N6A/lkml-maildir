Jens' patch is technical correct for SATA, but really we want to do more 
stuff at the SCSI layer (see James Bottomley's response to Jens' patch).
Unfortunately, this also implies that we have to figure out which SCSI 
devices are available to be power-managed, and which SCSI devices are on 
a shared bus that should never be suspended.
So currently we are in limbo...
