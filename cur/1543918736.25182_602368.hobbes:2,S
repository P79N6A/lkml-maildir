+# Check source files for compliance with coding standards, using terse
+# output in the style that g/cc produces.  This output can be easily parsed
+# within text editors (e.g., emacs/vim) which can produce a split text
+# screen showing in one screen the error message, and in another screen the
+# corresponding source file, with the cursor placed on the offending line.
+# See for example the documentation for Emacs's "next-error" command, often
+# bound to M-x ` (ESC x back-tick).
+
+# Usage: checkfiles file [files...]
+#        if "file" is a directory, will check all *.[hc] files recursively
+
+# check usage
+usage() {
+	echo "Usage: checkfiles file [files...]"
