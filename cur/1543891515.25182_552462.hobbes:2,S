nope, this function is on on hardware IRQ 19 in both cases.
it just looks like IRQ 17 in the ACPI case due to this:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.2[D] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 17
Totally bogus?  Yes.
google "Kill IRQ compression"
But while I truly hate this particular hack and I've wanted it gone for a long time,
it doesn't appear to be related to the failure at hand -- it just makes
it more irritating to debug.
