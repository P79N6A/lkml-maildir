Sorry, but that's just plain wrong. We shouldn't keep inode table in
buffer-cache at all. And we should be more aggressive on icache -
dcache looks sane now (recent 2.4.4-pre), but icache holds unused
inodes for too long. And freeing them is very slow _and_ random -
recipe for kmem_cache fragmentation.
/me sits down to port inode-table-in-pagecache to 2.4.4-pre4...
