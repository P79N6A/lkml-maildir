This can already be solved in userspace (and I'm sure it already has been
in some backup programs).  Use the FIBMAP ioctl() against the fd to find
out whether a particular block in the file is actually instantiated.
Not all filesystems necessarily implement FIBMAP, so one would need to fall
back to sucky mode if FIBMAP failed.
