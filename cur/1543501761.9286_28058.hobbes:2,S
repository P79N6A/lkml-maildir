And rewrite each program to _not_ open("/proc/self/fd/3") as
this is just a symlink to the real file, i.e. I could have passed
the filename right away.
stdin replacement seems the only way to deal with this _without_
rewriting the interpreters to know about /proc/self/script.
[I could just add an option to interpreter to take a fd as argument
anyway]

see above. of course, with appropriate /proc/self/script that handles
open() just fine (in fact ignores the open and just returns the fd)
this would be fine. Implementation would be ugly though. How (where)
do you pass the information to /proc? (that 3 is the script fd)
Probably you have to add this to struct task? or just reserve fd number
3 for this and nothing else (would this break any userspace semantics?
i.e. open() never returns fd 3, fd 3 is reserved for script passing
only).
Richard.
