They were removed because of possible incompatibility warning.
Maybe they should stay - I posted only currently used by me linux terminal
definition. As I said before there should be the official linux terminal
definition and description included with kernel sources because vt.c
in sources defines console behaviour.
Anyway acs, enacs, smacs and rmacs sequences are defined here 
to stick to the controls interpretation used in vt.c 
do_con_trol function and to get desired behaviour.
