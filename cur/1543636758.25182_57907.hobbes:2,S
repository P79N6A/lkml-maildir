Relax Alan.  Nothing is set in stone and we need to pick some number to
start playing with.
My test suite was _not_ Oracle (and who would run Oracle on a swapless
machine?) and I was not able to OOM the machine with my tests.  I in no
way contend 95% is perfect.  Even your 50% mode is not (nothing but
solely backing store can make any guarantees).
But "works for me" is a start and we can work on tuning it.  No
"swapless" mode will be perfect and while 65% may work for, another load
with gross overhead may need more room.
I sent you an email and told you I was doing this and asked your opinion
on a percentage.  Why are you picking on me now?
