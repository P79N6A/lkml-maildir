I know it does and people use it to casually browse the tree, not as an
update mechanism.  What you are talking about is something which makes
BK a GNU patch server.  A useful thing, I can imagine, but it isn't
happening on bkbits.net unless someone offers to pick up the cost of
another T1 line.  $800/month.
As it is we share the T1 line that bkbits.net uses with everything else,
including our voice over IP phone system.  I can definitely tell when 
someone does something on bkbits, it tends to garble the phone.
