Christian,
What does the output of "cat /proc/scsi/sg/*" look like?
Cdrecord should see your plextor writer both as /dev/scd0
and /dev/sg0 (assuming you don't have any other scsi devices).
Cdrecord goes on to scan the parallel generic devices (i.e. /dev/pg*)
if it doesn't find anything suitable on its /dev/sg* scan.
Your post doesn't supply any information that would link
this problem with the sym53c8xxx driver. If there is some
problem then there will be some "noise" in the /var/log/messages
file [typically showing multiple scsi bus resets].
BTW The "-vv" switch (and/or "-VV") on cdrecord will yield more
debug information. strace may also be useful.
