  Good day.
  I got the following, rather odd warning when building 2.6.17.6:
  MODPOST
WARNING: drivers/acpi/processor.o - Section mismatch: reference to
.init.data: from .text between 'acpi_processor_power_init' (at offset
0xe80) and 'acpi_safe_halt'
  No idea whether it affects anything for real, just thought it worth a
mention. My .config is attached.
