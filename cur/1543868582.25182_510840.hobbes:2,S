Hi,
Thank you for your comments.

Core dumping is separated two phases, one is the phase of writing
headers, the other is the phase of writing memory segments.  If the
coredump_omit_anon_shared setting is changed between these two phases,
a corrupted core file will be generated because the offsets written
in headers don't match their bodies.  So we need to use the same
setting in both phases.
I think that locking makes codes complex and generates overhead.
So I wouldn't like to use lock as far as possible.  I think passing
the flag as an extra argument is the simplest implementation to
avoid the core file corruption.
Thanks,
