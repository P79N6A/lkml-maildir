Well, PowerPC "dcbt" does prefetch() correctly, it doesn't ever raise  
exceptions, doesn't have any side effects, takes only enough CPU to  
decode the address, and is ignored if it would have to do anything  
other than load the cacheline from RAM.  Prefetch streams are halted  
when they reach the end of a page boundary (no trapping to the MMU)  
and if the TLB entry isn't present then they would asynchronously  
abort.  This is a suitable prefetch implementation for G5:
   #define prefetch(x) __asm__ __volatile__ ("dcbt 0, %0"::"r"(x));
On GCC4+ the "__builtin_prefetch" built-in functions is probably  
mildly better tuned for most architectures:
   #define PREFETCH_RD 0
   #define PREFETCH_WR 1
   #define PREFETCH_LOCALITY_NONE 0
   #define PREFETCH_LOCALITY_LOW  1
   #define PREFETCH_LOCALITY_MED  2
   #define PREFETCH_LOCALITY_HIGH 3
   #define prefetch(x, args...) __builtin_prefetch(x ,##args)
