Are you sure?  Do all bioses perform this auto correction?  I would have 
thought that they would simply fail the request because you asked for a 
sector or head that is outside the valid range.  Even if some bioses 
will accept illegal values and auto translate, I doubt that they all do.
And what if you error in the other direction?  If the MBR lists a LOWER 
number of heads than the bios thinks there is?  In that case you're 
going to ask the bios for a larger cylinder number, and it will happily 
read a sector from the disk that is further from the start than you 
intended.
