i'm wondering, could we go with Thomas' temporary patch that disables 
sky2 MSI if CONFIG_PM is enabled - we could revert that after 2.6.20. 
It's not like MSI is a life and death feature. On IO-APIC systems 
vectors are abundant and in any case we share irqs just fine. The true 
advantage of MSI is minimal. (MSI-X has the potential to be better by 
being message based, but in reality it still goes through the full IRQ 
layer.) MSI might be useful on really, really large systems - but i 
really hope those really large systems dont rely on CONFIG_PM. Meanwhile 
Thomas' patch maximizes the amount of working hardware (it has the 
chance to produce working systems in 100% of the cases) - which is a few 
orders of magnitude more important than IRQ management micro-costs. Am i 
missing anything?
