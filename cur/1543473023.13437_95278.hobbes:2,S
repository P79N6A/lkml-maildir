my last bad "storm" of bad checksums was the night my mirror program
grabbed all the XFree 3.3.3 updates from the RedHat site.  However, that
isn't the only time I get them.
I'm about half-convinced that the common thread in my case is which line
I end up on at the terminal server at my ISP.  I don't have enough data
at this point to say that conclusively, nor have I had the time to make
a detailed analysis of what data I do have.  It's especially aggravating
that I can't reliably trigger it yet.  I went for a week with no
checksum errors, then I got them for several days in a row.  I haven't
yet got to the point of logging all the TCP data and doing hand
validation of suspect packets.  I probably need to be able to trigger
the effect before I go there.
One participant in this thread suspects Ascend equipment is one of the
main culprits.  Just on general impressions, he could be right from my
point of view.
