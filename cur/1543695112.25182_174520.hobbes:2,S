AFAIK no,  pci_dev only  stores one pointer  to the  driver. Two drivers
fiddling with the same hw can be dangerous. What will happen if radeonfb
starts using hw  accel, touching registers without  DRM knowing it? What
is (IMHO) needed is a common  layer that works with hardware and exposes
an interface to both radeonfb and DRM. I think that Jon Smirl is working
on something like this.
