Thanks, I'll be looking at it ... the one thing I strongly dislike is
this change:

That removes the ability to display all kinds of significant
chip-specific state ... like whether a given signal has active
pullups or pulldowns, uses open-drain signaling, and so forth.
It also makes access a lot slower ... e.g. rather than one
batch of I2C or SPI operations for all N signals on a chip,
it's got to do N batches.
Plus it just needlessly breaks existing code.
I'll put together a version without that problem.
