CONFIG_USB_BANDWIDTH just controls whether usb_submit_urb()
fails or passes based on current bandwidth usage.
You shouldn't see the <clipped> messages about bandwidth alloc
increased|reduced unless you are running at console loglevel
7 or higher (KERN_DEBUG) (could be via Alt-SysRq-7).
I'll see about removing them anyway.
I don't know about the sound hickups you are hearing.  Tom Sailer
suggested just a day or two ago something about changing the
latency for the USB controller by using setpci.
BTW, lspci -vv would give much more useful info than just
using lspci.  E.g., it would show the current latency
value being used.
