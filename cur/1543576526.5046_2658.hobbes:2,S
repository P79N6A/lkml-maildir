I get this when patch'ing in test13-pre4-ac2 (with ReiserFS and Netfilter
patches, none of which touch SMP).
patching file arch/i386/kernel/smp.c
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] 
Apply anyway? [n] y
Hunk #1 FAILED at 278.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 511 (offset 9 lines).
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/i386/kernel/smp.c.rej
Works fine if I reverse it and then put it back in. ?
