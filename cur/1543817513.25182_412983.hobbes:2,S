Currently I cannot reproduce this, this may have to do with:
 - moved pl2303 adapter from one usb2 hub to another because kernel
barfed about it and that solved the barfing
 - compiled various versions of the kernel so many times, I lost track
of the exact config
 - different usb hub and perifs at home and at work.
As soon as I can reproduce the issue, I'll file a proper bug report
including photographs of the output.
Thanks for your time and effort.
