Could you look at these patches:
[PATCH 1/5] vmalloc: introduce __vmalloc_area() function
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111013183331326
[PATCH 5/5] vmalloc: use list of pages instead of array in vm_struct
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111013224029332
There are in mm3 now. Note that the second one will conflict with
your patch.
Is it possible to use __vmalloc_area()?
Oleg.
