Hello,
I find the kernel.org first page inconvenient for some people somehow
since the security stable came.
Now on the kernel.org page, we have 2.6.13.3 and 2.6.14-rc3. If one
wants to get 2.6.14-rc3, he shouldn't get 2.6.14-rc3 Full, but
2.6.14-rc3 Patch and 2.6.13 Full, which isn't there unfortunately. I
suggest we name 2.6.13.3 "security stable", and 2.6.13 "stable".
Fix the 1st line as:
s/The latest stable version/The latest security stable version/
Add a line below:
+The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:  	2.6.13
And adjust the F,V on the right accordingly.
The rational behind is:
2.6.13.3 is security stable, which we suggest users to use. However
the stable is still 2.6.13.
Comments?
