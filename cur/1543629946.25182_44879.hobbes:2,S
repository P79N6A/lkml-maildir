Yes. Seems like that module has not those options.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
     Maybe you own a Cirrus Logic soundcard instead ?
     ac97 reports that your soundcard uses a codec from Cirrus L.
     See /usr/src/linux/Documentation/sound/cs46xx maybe
     It could be possible that your sndconfig from RedHat detects a wrong one..

These entries only save and restore your mixer settings before/after (un)loading sound-slot-0.
So you can try to modprobe cs46xx or cs4232 for a Cirrus Logic Soundcard - but I suspect that this won't work correctly. Or try to load ac97_codec and ac97 only. Those es1371 soundcards have 2 dsps. ;-) But one should be enough for now.
If your model is not a Creative one try to use ES1370. Try lspci -n for that.
The PCI ID "1274:1371" should indicate that your card is from Creative, the ID "1274:5000" incidates that it is from Ensoniq.
