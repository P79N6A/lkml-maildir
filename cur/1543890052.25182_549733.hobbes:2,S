Uwe, when people ban you from posting to mailing lists it's  
incredibly rude to create a new email account and continue the same  
flamage that got you banned in the first place.  Why don't you go  
elsewhere until you can learn to be respectful and polite and keep a  
civil tone with people who are trying to help you?  At such time you  
may be welcome once more on these lists, but not until then.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
P.S: Don't bother replying since your new email address has already  
been placed adjacent to the old one in my killfile.
