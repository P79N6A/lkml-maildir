Sure.

I agree.  But "detecting the fact that the file has been changed" is a
really important use!  I think the challenge would be to come up with
applications that really depend on timestamps and that use them for
anything *other* than detecting when a file has changed.
(OK, so make is a special case--it cares not only about whether a file
has changed, but also about whether it has changed more recently than
some other file.  But I'd think a simple version would useful to any
network filesystem, or more generally to anything that caches a view of
the filesystem either on another machine or in userspace.)

Betraying my own interests--the NFSv4 protocol (unlike v2 or v3) uses a
specialized "change" attribute to maintain cache consistency instead of
depending on mtime/ctime.  So nfsd would be one immediate in-kernel
user.  Currently we're using ctime, which causes obvious problems.
But an improved ctime--one that actually increased whenever the file
changed--would also do the job.
