I assume you're talking about the patch I looked at a couple of days ago.
It's vulnerable to the same deadlock as work_on_cpu() has always been.
Just as an example, take a look at allocate_threshold_blocks().  That
function way down in the innards of x86 has blotted out large amounts of
kernel code, so that code can now not use work_on_cpu().  Anything which
happens inside ext3 commit (the entire block layer and all drivers
underneath it).  Large lumps of networking code.  Parts of the page
allocator and the VFS which I haven't started to think about yet.

Not!  The difference here is the queueing and serialisation which
introduces dependencies between unrelated subsystems which happen to
use this piece of core infrastructure.
