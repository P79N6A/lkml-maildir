Yikes! Sayings about never saying "never" aside... I should think the
goal is for everyone to be able to use kernel.org trees with reasonable
expectations. I'd like to see the day when distros can include a
pristine tree. I don't expect it, and the need for outside trees isn't
going away, but I'd like to see kernel.org be the canonical Linux for
more production systems, development starts, and non-i386 arch's.
With respect to Aunt Tillie, hardware discovery and kernel configuration
are separate issues. Can't the hardware probes be a separate package?
The autoconfigurator I think will be useful, but can't the configurator
just be dependent on outside packages like other functionality is
dependent on isdn4k-utils or iptables?
