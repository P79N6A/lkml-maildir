You want mencoder to use 80% of your cpu and be scheduled fast enough to
not drop frames. Sounds to me like both latency and cpu share are
required, no? And if something uses up 80% of your cpu your
interactivity drops. Why is that a surprise? If something wants lower
latency but doesnt want a lot of cpu, it will only use what it wants. I
don't see a problem here.
If X is not smooth, then that is a problem. This scheduler is still
under development.
