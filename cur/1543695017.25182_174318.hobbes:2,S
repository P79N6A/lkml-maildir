Subject: Fix x86 subarch breakage by the patch to allow more APIC irq sources

The problem with this patch was that it defined a new quantity
NR_IRQ_VECTORS.  However, the definition of NR_IRQ_VECTORS is only in
mach-default/irq_vectors.h.  Every subarch which defines it's own
irq_vectors.h (that's voyager, visws and pc9800) now won't compile.
I think the best fix is the attached (although you could clean up
mach-default/irq_vectors.h with this too).
