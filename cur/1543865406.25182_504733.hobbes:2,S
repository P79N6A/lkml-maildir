Doesn't matter - you can just do it lazily. If you find a page that is
locked, move it to the locked list. when unlocking a page you *always*
move it back to the normal list. If someone else is still locking it,
we'll move it back to the lock list on next reclaim pass.
I have a half-finished patch from 6 months ago that does this, but never
found time to complete it ;-(
