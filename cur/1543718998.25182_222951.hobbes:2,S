Conclusion:
You really should learn how to read :)
This is a *technical* discussion list. So far you been able to post 7
mails about vague ramblings about what you think the VM should do and
what swapping is (not to mention unjustified personal attacks).
If you really think there is a problem with the VM post benchmarks
demonstrating the problem. 
If you don't think there is a problem, don't waste our time.
If you want to continue this discussion, please do so off-list.
Best regards,
