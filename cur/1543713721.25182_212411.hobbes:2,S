I described the possible solution (virtual stack)
which can easily take care of this problem for some
subsystems, or am I wrong. If code doesn't allocate
big buffers in stack my solution can make conversion
of existing code possible without _lot_ of work. (I'm
lazy - remember :-)
What do you think about my solution? Despite some
additional overhead, but I don't think that it is
significant.
Serge.
