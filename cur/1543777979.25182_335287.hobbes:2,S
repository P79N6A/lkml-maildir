It's about tunning the VM parameters...
That's my first question on list:
"Is HugeTBL proc memory parameters only to hugetlbfs "filesystem" or are 
these parameters affect ramfs, shm and tmpfs too?
What is the basic difference between ramfs, hugetlbfs, shm and tmpfs to 
the memory management / process VLM utilization?

Márcio."
