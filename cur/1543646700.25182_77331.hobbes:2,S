   Dave says I'm wierd and no one else sees these bizarre problems, btw :)
The only case where I'm really concerned about the health
of your PCI controller is the most recent case you've
reported to me where pci_find_capability(pdev, PCI_CAP_ID_PM)
fails.  That is just completely bizarre.
I hope your boards aren't being permanently harmed by your box which
is overheating.:(
