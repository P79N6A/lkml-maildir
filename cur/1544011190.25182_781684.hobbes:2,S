Since I recommended an internal helper function, we could have:
int globmatch(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
	int ret;
	ret = globmatch_internal(pat, str, 0);
	if (ret < 0)
		WARN_ON();
	return ret;
}
int globmatch_user(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
	return globmatch_internal(pat, str, 0);
}
This would warn on if a kernel user caused the overflow, and also gives
a function that user space input could use, that would not warn on
overflow.
