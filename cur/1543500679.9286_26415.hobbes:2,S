Well, that's maybe too confusing to the user. For the simple opening/
writing of files they're not neccessary so one would maybe omit them
for the first try (there is actually also not that many software
which is using it).
But actually the idea about using a modified NFS-Server sounds
interesting..
The question might then be if it's not a good idea to have
a general stub in the kernel for attaching user space filesystems.
There might be some more ideas for filesystems which will be too
much code to be in the kernel (and the DAV-FS would one of these
as also XML has to be parsed inside it, etc.)

Well, as far as I understand it that's then only for GNOME apps.
Thus not the goal ;-) But maybe at least a good start.

I know that it's useful, I see on Windows. But you're right that it will
blow up the kernel too much.

The only problem is that I don't have time to code that and my only question
was also if someone's maybe working on it so that I might test it.
Well, and as the answer is apparently "No" that's all I want to know.
When I have time I might start looking at the NFS-Server and maybe extending
it to make it a general server for user space filesystems (and not only
DAV).
Anyway, have a nice weekend!
