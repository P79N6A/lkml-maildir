Jeff, this no longer causes build failure whether libata is configured
built-in or as a module.  I have no idea what's going on but there
doesn't seem to be a proper solution on the horizon yet.  I think we can
go ahead and commit this one and convert it to __initdataconst when it
becomes available.
Thanks.
