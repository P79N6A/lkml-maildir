I have a bunch of servers from rackable, dual core cpu, 2G ram 2xgigE on the 
motherboard (1x100M on motherboard), 4x Intel E1000 quad port cards, 120G SATA 
drive, DVD burner, floppy
3u, 18 gig ports, just under $5k
if you have 36" deep racks you can put them back to back and have two of these 
in 3u (12 gig ports per u)
not nessasarily the cheapest available, but they've been reliable, and there's 
pleanty of CPU and ram to handle firewall tasks.
besides, sometimes you don't want to trust the closed-source vlan 
implementations on the switches ;-)
