   Was this behavior intentionally changed and why?
   Looks like 2.2.X gives ECONNREFUSED, but 2.4.X doesn't and times out.
It was intentionally changed because there is no way for the "ICMP
port unreachable" message coming back to be uniquely matched to that
UDP socket.  It can reset sockets illegally in high load scenerios.
Solaris and other systems act identically.
