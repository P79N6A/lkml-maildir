That ought to be a case of flipping the way the kernel hands out pages.
I've always wondered why we get them often in reverse order but never
sat down and worked it out

The AMD64 is a little unusual in that it has an IO MMU, so requests for
mappings that are physically high memory, not easy to merge, etc can
be made to appear in a convenient order lower down in memory. Thus
asking to map memory at virtual addresses above 4Gb probably hands back
a PCI address around 3.5Gb. That mapping will also vanish (gone forever
and the PCI address will show other data instead) when you unmap it.
