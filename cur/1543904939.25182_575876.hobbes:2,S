These options control *who* may mount and *when* to mount.  They are
not a property of the mount itself and are not added to /etc/mtab.
There's a "user=ID" option that is added to /etc/mtab in case of user
mounts.  This identifies the owner of the mount, so that it can be
unmounted by that user.  There are patches in -mm that enable the
kernel to store this info.
Do you have other examples in mind?
