Actually, BenH's patch touched code that is in the slow path.  The font
rotation is done on the entire fontdata, then stored, on a console switch.
Thus the rest of the drawing functions need not do repetitive and expensive
bitmap rotation.
Scrolling performance of a normally oriented and upside-down rotation is
practically the same (1024x768 8x16 redraw).
con_rotate = 0
real    0m2.550s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m2.543s
con_rotate = 2
real    0m2.559s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m2.545s
CCW and CW rotation, is of course slower, because the blit direction
tends to be top->down, rather than left->right.
con_rotate = 1
real    0m4.675s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m4.663s
con_rotate = 3
real    0m4.701s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m4.684s
