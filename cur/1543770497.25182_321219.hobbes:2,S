Subject: Will __pa(vmalloc()) ever work?

I have a driver that calls __pa() on an address obtained via vmalloc().  This is not 
supposed to work, and yet oddly it appears to.  Is there a possibility, even a remote one, 
that __pa() will return the correct physical address for a buffer returned by the 
vmalloc() function?
Also, does the pgd/pmd/pte page-table walking work on addresses returned by kmalloc(), or 
do I have to use __pa() to get the physical address?
