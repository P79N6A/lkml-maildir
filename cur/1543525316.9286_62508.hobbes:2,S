There should be no differenace appart from the defined timeout in
/etc/lilo.conf.
It should take the same amount of time to uncompress the image on
both a boot floppy created with dd in your case, as booting from a
lilo floppy, the only differance is, the time is measured from the
time you hit enter on the lilo floppy. Or the files are not the same.
If there is a big differance and the files are the same, it could be
that one floopy is on the virge of going corrupt.
