Subject: inode leakage fix proposed for 2.2.14

I propose the inode leakage fixes I posted here some day ago to be merged
in 2.2.14. It makes sure that the icache will be shrunk properly. Without
my fix you'll get inode-max message during heavy dcache/inode intesive
operations (or even worse you'll leak memory on <2.2.14pre). rsync
exploits such design leak trivially. The patch is not changed at all. It's
the same I posted to the list some day ago.
