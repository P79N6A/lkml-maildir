This has not been my experience.  Reading from hda continues to
work as expected.  But the process reading from hdc stays stuck
in D state for a _long_ time....  A kill -9 takes like 10 minutes
before it gets around to actually killing anything.

Sure.  Same as above.

There is a certain amount of delay when a drive hits a bad
sector.  But Linux handles things pretty badly IMHO, and could 
do a much better job.
