The "Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English"
(1995 edition) says that a disc is:
(also esp US disk)
1. a flat, thin, round object, eg a coin (he wears an identity disc
   around his neck)
2. a round surface that appears to be flat (the moon's disc)
3. = record (recordings on disc and cassette) see also compact disc
4. = disk 2
5. (anatomy) a layer of cartilage between the bones of the spine

And a disk is:
1. (esp US) disc
2. (computing) a circular plate on which data can be recorded in a
   form that can be used by a computer
