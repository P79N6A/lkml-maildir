There isn't a single one.  Even for Debian, it was a hard struggle to
get sown to just two (or three?).  Now try that across distributions,
or for people who own choosy hardware. (I once had to deal with a box
which didn't like anything else except 2.6.0-test9.  I believe it's
still running this version, maybe slightly patched.)

In essence, this is just a slower version of the current model.  It
won't change that much, unless the speed of the development cycle (and
its phase) matches your needs, which is unlikely.  Security bugs would
still be discovered at about the same rate.
