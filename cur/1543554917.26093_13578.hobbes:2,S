I tried to push this through when I was hacking heavily on fbdev
drivers, especially S3, and it didn't fly.  On x86's, those addresses
are already reserved:
[jgarzik@rum linux_2_4]$ cat /proc/iomem
00000000-0009efff : System RAM
000a0000-000bffff : Video RAM area
000c0000-000c7fff : Video ROM
000f0000-000fffff : System ROM
[...]
If they are not reserved on your arch, I think the driver should
definitely reserve the region.  (though if its an ISA-compatible arch,
Linus might desire the above reservations as done by the core, not by
the fbdev driver)
Another alternative I thought of is freeing the resource if it is
allocated by the system, and having the driver allocate its own
resource.  When the driver unloads, it frees its resources and allocates
the whole region back to the system.  I look at this as the fbdev
driver's "clarifying the picture" of the hardware resource usage. 
[again, this hullabaloo might only be necessary on x86]
