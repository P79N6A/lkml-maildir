Hi there,
just gave 2.6.9-rc1 a try. gcc warning:
fs/smbfs/inode.c: In function `smb_fill_super':
fs/smbfs/inode.c:563: warning: comparison is always false due to limited
range of data type
fs/smbfs/inode.c:564: warning: comparison is always false due to limited
range of data type
Paul Jackson has already submitted a patch (on the 8 of August) about
this warning but i guess it was forgotten. Just informing about it.
Boris.
