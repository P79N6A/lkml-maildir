I am able to reproduce this with 2.6.16-rc5 - 2.6.16.  There is a problem in 
scsi_req_map_sg which is called by scsi_execute_async.
Currently, scsi_req_map_sg assumes every sgl entry is page aligned.  It will 
cause later slab corruption by under-allocating the number of bio entries if 
sgl[0].offset + sgl[last].length > PAGE_SIZE.
Dan pointed this out, and I have submitted a patch that I believe correctly 
fixes the issue.  Just waiting for some feedback.
