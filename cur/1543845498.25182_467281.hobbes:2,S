Uhm.... yes.  Thanks.
But are the pages that totalram is measure in, normal pages, of
page_cache pages?  And is there a difference?
Should we use PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT, or PAGE_SHIFT?
And why do we have both if they are numerically identical?
I'll submit a patch which uses
        12 - PAGE_SHIFT
in a little while.
Thanks,
