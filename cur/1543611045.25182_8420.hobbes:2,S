Perhaps you or one of the other gurus could explain the following
observations, which I am sure that I and many other readers would find
very enlightening:
I have an IBM-DTLA-307045 drive connected to a PDC20265 controller on
an ia32 machine running 2.4.16.  After reading this discussion and
hearing about the problems that others have had with the IBM 75GXP
series, I thought that I should test out my drive to see if it is OK.
So I ran 'dd if=/dev/hde of=/dev/null bs=128k'.  Every thing went
fine, except for about five seconds in the middle, when the disk made
a lot of grinding sounds and the system was unresponsive.  That
generated the log messages messages appended below.
However, running the dd command again (after a reboot) produced no
errors.  So the drive remapped some bad sectors the first time
through?  The common wisdom here is that once you get to the point
where the drive reports a bad sector, you are in trouble.  If so, why
did the second dd command work OK?  I have had no other problems with
this drive.
Thanks, Wayne
