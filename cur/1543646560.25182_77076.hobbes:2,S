That you have that many processes hanging in the D-state is
a concern.  That the load number is inflated is telling you
something is wrong.  If not then the logic feeding the load
number needs changing.
Are all those processes hanging because of NFS?  If so, i'd
start by looking at the mount options as i said before.  I'd
also look into the network and fileserver because something
is wrong.  In my experience Solaris behaved the same way.
