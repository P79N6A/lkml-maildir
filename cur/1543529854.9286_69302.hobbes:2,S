xargs already does an implicit `--max-chars=20k'.  `--max-files'
wouldn't help.
The problem seems to be a very large environment, and the kernel
complains because it has a limit on total environment and argument
space.
The solution is probably to clear the offending environment variable,
either using `env', `unset' or the makefile itself.
