Thanks for this - you saved me a headache :-)

All this really belongs in fs/compat.c ...
One thing that Linus (and I) wanted from the compatability layer is
to try to keep all 32 bit assumptions out of the generic code - I
understand that this my not be possible, but we would like to try.
So maybe you could start by changing ioctl32 to compat_ioctl everywhere -
I know that this is just cosmetic, but it gives the better impression of
what the code is about ...
