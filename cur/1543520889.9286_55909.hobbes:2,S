Actually, the PCI1225 has two functions - there's one per slot. So you
just see the code noticing them both (ie it's doing the right thing so
far, but is just a bit too verbose about it ;)

I actually have access to that particular controller, so I know the
controller itself works with the driver, but one likely problem is just
interrupt routing. Mind sending me the full kernel log of the thing?

We'll want to move these functions over to generic files anyway - that has
been discussed due to entirely different reasons wrt the alpha (ie Andrea
Arkangeli and Richard Henderson). So that wart should go away.
