Not to say it is perfect either. Normal semantics say not to touch
a page if it is not somehow pinned. So this may cause problems in
corner cases (DEBUG_PAGEALLOC comes to mind... hopefully nothing else).
But I think a plain read of the page when it isn't pinned is less
yucky than writing into the non-pinned struct page.
