a quick suggestion: could you add this near the top of sched.c (below
the #include lines):
 #define static
this will turn off all inlining and makes the scheduler-internal
functions visible. If there's any scheduler-internal overhead we should
see it. Maybe this is the CR3 flush (switch_mm()) - but 274 usecs is
still excessive ...
