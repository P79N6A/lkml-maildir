Mhm, I'm not a kernel developer but I think that people how need the newest 
kernel can also use a patch. In this case 2.4.19 pre1 which doesn't need much 
time.
So I see no Problem.
I think Marcelo does his work well.
If anyone needs a new kernel, your dist will have well tested working kernels 
for your arch.
If a person has a special arch, he must know how to patch a kernel.
So there is no need to make special things for __any__ architecture.
The final release is fine and very usefull, but if you have problems with it, 
you should be able to use the pre versions from the next release.
I only write this, because I don't like it that people say: The 2.4.x is too 
buggy, you miss some of the other archs, I need a wallpaper in the background 
of my xconfig.
I am a user, I make mistakes with the configuration of the kernel.
I use new kernel, but if something goes wrong I know that it's my fault, 
because I don't want to wait.
Mhm, should be enough ;)
thanks for all people who work on Open Source products
have fun
