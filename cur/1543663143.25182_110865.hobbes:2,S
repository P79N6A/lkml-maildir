OK.  For reference, the "state of 2.4" solution (which is also the
"state of 2.5" solution) looks like:
> 	struct proc_dir_entry *de = create_proc_entry(...);
> 	void *my_data;
> 
> 	de->data = my_data = kmalloc(...);
=====>  de->owner = THIS_MODULE;

And have proc_file_operations do the standard owner get and release:
	open: proc_open,
	release: proc_release,
static int proc_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
{
	struct proc_dir_entry *dp = PDE(inode);
	if (!try_module_get(dp->owner))
		return -ENOENT;
	return 0;
}
static int proc_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
{
	struct proc_dir_entry *dp = PDE(inode);
	module_put(dp->owner);
	return 0;
}
Now, if remove_proc_entry() is called from module_exit(), the kfree()
works fine, since (1) we wouldn't be in module_exit() if the proc
entry was in used, and (2) the try_module_get() prevents any new
users.
Of course, if you wanted to remove the entry at any other time
(eg. hotplug), this doesn't help you one damn bit (which is kind of
your point).

This is what network devices do, and what the sockopt registration
code does, too, so this is already in the kernel, too.  It's not
great, but it becomes a noop for the module deregistration stuff.
Thanks!
Rusty.
