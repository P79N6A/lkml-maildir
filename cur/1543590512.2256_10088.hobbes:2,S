I would encourage all of you to consider using a fractal fileset generator such as
reiserfs_fract_tree.c such as we use for mongo.pl which we use for internal
benchmarking.  You can get a copy at www.namesys.com in the benchmarking section,
and then tune it as suits your needs.  I think that one needs randomly generated
non-uniform sized files and directories and directory trees to have a good
benchmark.
We gratefully accept enhancements of it.
Now that we are stable we can go back to tuning things like large file performance.
