Hi all,
My manpage for munmap(2) says:
On success, munmap returns 0, on failure -1, and errno is set (probably to EINVAL).
In reality munmap always returns 0, except for when the address is
not page-aligned (-EINVAL) or if allocation of kernel structures
fails (-ENOMEM).
Shouldn't munmap return -EINVAL also if there is nothing mapped
at the specified address?
Regards,
Udo.
