About 0.2% on database transaction processing benchmark.  It was done a while
back on top of a major Linux vendor kernel. I will retest it again for 2.6.19.

I will try that too.  I'm a bit touchy about sharing a cache line for different
bio.  But given that there are 200,000 I/O per second we are currently pushing
the kernel, the chances of two cpu working on two bio that sits in the same
cache line are pretty small.
