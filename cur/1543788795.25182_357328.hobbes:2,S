You've just introduced a leak here, obviously.
Please, read the code before "fixing" that stuff; slapping returns at random
and hoping that it will help is not a good way to deal with that - the only
thing you achieve is hiding the problem.
The same goes for the rest of patch - in each case it's not obvious that your
changes are correct.
