Now _that_ was an improvement. After hald has been stopped the problem
is gone.
Even better: Seems that hald was responsible for keeping my CD drive
spinning all the time. Since hald is gone the CD drive stops spinning
after a few seconds :-). And playing DVDs the whole system is _much_
more responsive, the DVD navigation menus are faster, etc.
Hopefully there is a configure option to tell hald to keep the CD drive
alone.
Thanx very much
Harri
