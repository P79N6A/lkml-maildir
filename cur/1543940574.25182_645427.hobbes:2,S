I think using a separate taint flag that does not disable GPL symbols
for the ndiswrapper case would be a fair solution. After all the main
motivation for tainting ndiswrapper is to make it visible in oopses, but not 
prevent it from loading in the first place.
How about you submit an incremental patch to do that?
