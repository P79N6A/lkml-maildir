It would not stop if you queued the events.
What is the difference between queueing events to be read from
a pipe or socket or queueing them for a kernel thread that empties
the queue by executing /sbin/hotplug for each entry in the queue.
The pipe/socket solution is probably better anyway, I was just
wondering why /sbin/hotplug wasn't serialized from the start.
