   However, shouldn't pci_dma_sync_*() be called *before* each
   PCI_DMA_TODEVICE DMA transfer (after the CPU write, of course) and
   *after* each PCI_DMA_FROMDEVICE DMA transfer (before CPU access)? And,
   of course, before and after a "bidirectional" DMA, if appropriate.
CPU owns the data before pci_map_{sg,single}(), afterwards device
owns the data.  If CPU wants ownership again, it must wait for
device to finish with the data when do a pci_sync_{sg,single}().
You are thinking about CPU cache flushing, and that is a detail
handled transparently to the DMA apis.  If you follow the rules
described in the documentation and in my previous paragraph,
the ARCH specific code does the right thing for you.
