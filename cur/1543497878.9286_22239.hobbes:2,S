  Hi, all. Version 99.2 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: the devfs-patch-v99.x patches are backports to 2.2.x kernels of
the latest devfs-patches (which are for 2.3.x kernels). This effort is
being undertaken by Zoltan Balaton.
This is against 2.2.9. Highlights of this release:
- Backported devfs-patch-v107 to kernel 2.2.9
  Thanks to Zoltan BALATON <balaton@eik.bme.hu>
				Regards,
					Richard....
