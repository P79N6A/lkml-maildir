some more information on the "zip-issue":
I removed the reference to my ide-zip-drive (noauto,user /dev/hdb1) from fstab.
Again e2fsck /dev/hda3 failed after a reboot. After a mount/unmount-cycle of
/dev/hdb1 a e2fsck -f -n /dev/hda3 finished without any problems. So it seems
necessary that the partition-table of hdb is read before e2fsck can check a
partition (> 2 GB) on hda.
