Subject: [PATCH] IPMI: fix occasional oops on module unload
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/30/170

Olaf Kirch of SuSE tracked down a problem where module unloads of
the IPMI driver would occasionally result in Oopses.  He tracked
that down to a variable that wasn't always initialized properly
in some situations.  This patch initializes that variable.
Olaf sent a patch that kzalloc-ed the data, but this structure
is large enough that I would perfer to not do that.
Thanks Olaf!
