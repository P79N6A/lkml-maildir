Trying to do a stock install with RH6 we continuously get a kernel panic
followed by a NON REENTRANT failure with the fdomain.o driver. We have an
Adaptec 2920a w BIOS version 3.2 and a Seagate 2GB disk on an Intel P150 with
64Mb of RAM. We've tried several different things...
we used the fdomain.o driver from the 2.2.5-22 kernel by insmod and succeeded
once (but that success has not been duplicatable)
we used a cdrom boot install instead of a floppy boot install and succeeded once
there as well, though we haven't been able to duplicate that success either
What is the problem with the fdomain.o driver?
Is there a known bug/fix pair here?
What to do?
