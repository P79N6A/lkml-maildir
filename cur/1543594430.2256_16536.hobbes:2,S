It should also be good for streaming file use.  It gives a natural way
of detecting when you should be doing drop-behind (things fall out of
the fifo without ever making it into the LRU); doubly nice because it
works for both reads and writes without needing to treat them
differently.  It's also nice that it gives a natural interpretation to
the various madvise() flags.
