I think you are right about that. But that of course only
helps if it was not modified by code before Linux is loaded.

I believe you are right that the IRQ controller is the most
important hardware component to reprogram. But I don't think
it is the only. Certainly you ought to reprogram the PIT to
the right speed, but there might be other hardware that
needs to be reprogrammed as well.

Isn't that code conventionally called by jumping to
0xffff:0x0000? (Not that it matters, because the first
instruction in all BIOSes I have seen is a jump to
0xf000:0xe05b.)

Yes, the BIOS code usually knows almost everything that
needs to be initialized. If you are in real mode, and
jump to 0xFFFF:0x0000 there is almost nothing that can
possibly go wrong because you left some hardware in the
wrong state.
