Multilink PPP likes to get the kernel in a tight loop that spams the 
console at a high rate and totally freezes the machine. I'm getting
details to post more info but it is reproducable with a USR Dual standard
on COM1 and a USR NonWinModem PCI modem on pseudo-COM4 dialed in and bonded
together. Usually occurs within an hour of bondage. This has happened
as long as MPPP has been in the kernel so I'm working on finding the offending
bug. (2.3.xx -> present)
