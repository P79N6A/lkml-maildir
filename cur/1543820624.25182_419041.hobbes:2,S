vmalloc mappings are $$$ on many archs so they should be avoided if in
any way possible. Also, kmalloc can handle more than just a page, and it
might be better to just use that here rather than alloc_pages actually
since I presume there is nothing preventing the bitmap sharing pages
with other data.
In this case I think adding the vmalloc call is overkill, I would simply
make it call kmalloc_node() unconditionally for all sizes and let it
fail if that situation occurs, given how unlikely it is.

I would expect this part of the patch to be able to go in as is,
straight away so I don't think it should be a problem. It's not a big
deal whether we do it one way or another to me.
