Maybe this quote will summarize the situation:
Judith: [on Stan's desire to be a mother] Here! I've got an idea: Suppose you
	agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb - which is
	nobody's fault, not even the Romans' - but that he can have the *right*
	to have babies.
Francis: Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for your right to
	have babies, brother... sister, sorry.
Reg: What's the *point*?
Francis: What?
Reg: What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies, when he can't
	have babies?
Francis: It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
Reg: It's symbolic of his struggle against reality.
