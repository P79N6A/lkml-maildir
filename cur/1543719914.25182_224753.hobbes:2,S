Well bear in mind that we can then rip all the pt_regs passing out from
everywhere, so as long as you edit every IRQ handler in the kernel it's a
net win ;)
I _think_ it'll work - as long as all architectures go through a common
dispatch function like do_IRQ(), which surely they do.  The above code
could be an arch-neutral inline actually.
I'm not sure what's best really.  But something this general is more
attractive than something which is purely for sysrs-T.
