Recently, a openoffice hacker wrote in his blog that the kernel was
culprit of applications not starting as fast as in other systems.
Most of the reasons he gave were wrong, but there was a interesting
one: When you start your system, you've lots of free memory. Since
you have lots of memory, he said it was reasonable to expect that
kernel would readahead *heavily* everything it can to fill that
memory as soon as possible (hoping that what you readahead'ed was
part of the kde/gnome/openoffice libraries etc) and go back to the
normal behaviour when your free memory is used by caches etc.
"Teorically" it looks like a nice heuristic for desktops. Does
adaptative readahead does something like this?
