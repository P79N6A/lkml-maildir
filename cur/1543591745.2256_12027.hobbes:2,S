Which is an utterly stupid thing to do.
Please construct a plausable situation where this would occur legally
and not be a driver bug, given the maximum number of PCI busses and
slots found on sparc64 and the maximum _concurrent_ usage of PCI dma
space for any given driver (which isn't doing something stupid).
