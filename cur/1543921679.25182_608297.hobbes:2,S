The purpose of the API, as defines itself is meant to be generic and 
architecture neutral, and the few functions it defines are.
Since I needed some GPIO helpers for the RDC R-321x SoC, I picked up this one. 
Now if you want to propose another one go ahead, and I will rebase my code on 
top of yours.
