If I catch a signal (SIGUSR2) using "sigaction" call
then is the signal handler replaced with default
handling, if I don't install the signal handler again?
I remember that in UNIX "signal" system call default
signal bahavior was to replace the signal handler with
default after everytime signal was received?
My observation is that even if I get same signal
twice, I get the same print (which I have in my signal
handler) again, illustrating that signal handler was
not replaced with default !!! Is that the correct
behavior of "sigaction"?
Thanks,
Tom
