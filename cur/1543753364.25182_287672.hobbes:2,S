Quote from loop-AES README file
"
Loop device encrypts data but does not authenticate ciphertext. In other
words, it delivers data privacy, but does not guarantee that data has not
been tampered with. Admins setting up encrypted file systems should ensure
that neither ciphertext, nor tools used to access ciphertext (kernel +
kernel modules, mount, losetup, and other utilities) can be trojaned or
tampered.
