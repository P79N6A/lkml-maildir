Thanks!!!!
Can you tell me if it was crashing only if raid controller was used, or did
it crash on normal ide too?
I could wait until stable kernel is out, living only with software raid and
use HW afterwards. or use your patch of course!
Does this motherboard have any other (Linux or any other) performance and
stability issues?
Rgds,
Vasja
