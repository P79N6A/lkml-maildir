i suspect some kobject related race, and i have the feeling this all is 
timing dependent.
Andrew started seeing reboot hangs roughly around the time when the 
kobject changes went upstream. Given that x86.git had flux in that 
timeframe too i couldnt be sure what caused them.
i have the fixlet below in x86.git but it didnt solve Andrew's problem 
so it's parking now at the end of the queue, with no clear purpose in 
life :-) If it would solve someone's problem it might be revitalized.
Note: this does not fix any particular bug i know about, it's just a 
hack.
