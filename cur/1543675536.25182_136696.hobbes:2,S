Maybe the following should be unnecessary after all these years since
the ANSI C standard was introduced, but several files associated with
zlib were using the old-style function declaration.
So, here is a proposed addition to CodingStyle, just to make it clear.

 and it gets confused.  You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like
 to understand what you did 2 weeks from now. 
 
+Function declarations should be new-style:
+
+int foo(long bar, long day, struct magic *xyzzy)
+or
+int foo(
+	long bar,
+	long day,
+	struct magic *xyzzy
+)
+
+Old-style function declarations are deprecated:
+
+int foo(bar, day, xyzzy)
+long bar, day;
+struct magic *xyzzy;
