There must have been more output than that?  Please transcribe some more of
the backtrace and send it.  Don't worry about all the hex numbers: the
important parts are these:
 EIP is at i810fb_cursor+0x1da/0x240 [i810fb]
 Call Trace:
 [<...>] apic_timer_interrupt+0x1a/0x20
 [<...>] bh_lru_install+0xb5/0x100
 [<...>] __find_get_block+0x73/0xf0
 [<...>] __getblk+0x2b/0x60
 [<...>] is_tree_node+0x6b/0x70
 [<...>] search_by_key+0x6f9/0xf30
 [<...>] search_for_position_by_key+0x1be/0x3d0
 [<...>] apic_timer_interrupt+0x1a/0x20
Also, try stripping your kernel down by unconfiguring drivers and features
which are not needed for a successful boot.  This will help identify the
buggy component.
Also, try adding the string `initcall_debug' to the kernel boot command
line.  Watch out for the messages "calling initcall 0xNNNNNNNN".  Take a
note of the final address which is printed before the crash and look it up
in the 2.6 kernel's System.map file.
Thanks.
