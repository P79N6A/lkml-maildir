Subject: Diskstats inconsistancy between 2.4.23 & 2.6 was: Linux 2.6.0

A while back there was a flamewar about adding diskstats to
/proc/partitions, and so /proc/diskstats was created, also it is a config
option in 2.4.  In 2.6, the stats are in /proc/partitions, but there is no
/proc/diskstats or config option.
Is /proc/diskstats going to be forward ported?
