Hello all,
for some reason a 2.6.18-rc2-mm1 build seems to kill my /dev/null device!
A simple
# make bzImage modules modules_install
managed to reduce my
crw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       1,   3 27. Jul 12:04 null
into the charred remains equivalent of
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 27. Jul 12:02 null
, *twice* (I tried it the first time and had that issue,
then rebuilt the device and rebooted, same problem once build started).
Any idea why this might happen?
This did not happen with a 2.6.18-rc1-mm2 build.
A simple
rm /dev/null
mknod /dev/null c 1 3
chmod 666 /dev/null
corrects the problem, BTW.
Thanks,
Andreas Mohr
