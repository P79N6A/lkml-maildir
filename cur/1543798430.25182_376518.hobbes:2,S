Actually Thomas, the above code doesn't handle it correctly, although,
the code you have in hrtimer.c does.  Here you say ">" where it should
be ">=", otherwise you can have the affect that I explained in the
reference that Roman stated.
Although run_hrtimer_queue is still correct, I think you might want to
change the hrtimer_forward.  It has a ">" where it should be ">=".
