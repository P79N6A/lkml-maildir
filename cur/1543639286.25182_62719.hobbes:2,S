No, I don't claim it is standard behavior (I also don't claim it isn't
and unfortunately the C99 standard is not free so I cannot check it).
I just claim that if the value isn't going to be reused, using the
instruction with memory operands should be faster, because otherwise
there would have been little reason to include it in the instruction set
(except code size optimization, but it seems very unlikely that a CPU
would include CISC instructions just for that).
So a working GCC with optimization enabled should generate it and
especially should always generate it if it generates it in one
compilation (because of volatility).
Of course there is a risk of failure, but it seems small enough to not
worry about it unless there are other good reasons for the compiler to
behave differently.
However OTOH if it fails it would fail subtly so maybe it's better to do
it safely with inline assembly.
