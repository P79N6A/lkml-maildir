I have just released a file system driver for the RBF file system as
used by the real-time operating system OS-9/OS-9000 from Microware
Systems Corp (now Radisys). Patches are available for a number of
different kernels in the 2.4 series. These have been tested for the i386
and m68k architectures - others should work. If interested, you can
download a patch from <
http://www.geocities.com/linuxrbf>.
This is my first pass at a Linux File System, so any comments, feedback,
suggestions etc would be welcome!
Andrew
