I downloaded 2.6.13-rc2-mm2-broken-out.tar.bz2 and verified the signature.
Then I untarred it and moved it to the patches/ dir.
Output of 'quilt push -a' ends with:
    Applying git-netdev-janitor-fixup.patch
    patch: **** Only garbage was found in the patch input.
    Patch git-netdev-janitor-fixup.patch does not apply (enforce with -f)
There were also a slew of patches that applied with offset errors before that.
Is the broken-out tarfile supposed to be usable like this?
