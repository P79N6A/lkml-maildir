Hello!
    This small patch fixes a savelinks problem on bigendian platforms, where
    savelinks were not working at all because of incorrect cpu->disk endianness conversion.
    Savelinks are used on reiserfs to remember "truncate" and "unlink" events
    so that if crash happens in the middle of truncate/unlink, we do not endup with
    lost or half truncated files.
