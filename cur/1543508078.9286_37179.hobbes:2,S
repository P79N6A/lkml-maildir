Hi guys,
i've just finished my military service so i'm in again ;-)
1.) This file had been last updated on 4.8.1997!
2.) The most of inline asm statements are obsolete. New
gcc family (gcc/egxs 2.9x) generate errors when find input register in
clobber list. It seems gcc-2.7.X.Y don't have this problem and accept
new convention.
So is there interest to be rewriten for newer compilers or just
will be removed from the tree?
Alan? Linus?
