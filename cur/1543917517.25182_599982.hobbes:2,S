The original purpose was to catch the most tivial coding style errors.
But then people started to be far too innovative and we now ended
up with a checkpatch that try to check for every lillte glory detail.
It would be much preferable to have a checkpatch - and that may be an
incarnation of the current one or a new one.
What it should do would be to catch the trivialities that we see happens
in many patch submissions like:
a) wrong patch format (-p1, unified diff)
b) Whitespace versus tabs
c) PascalCasing in new functions
d) excessive line length
e) C99 comments '//' (not that I see why they are banned)
and maybe a few more trivial chacks.
This would benefit from a very low false-positive rate and it could then
be used as a patch-bot.
As it is now where it tries to check for everything and a bit more
it generates too much noise so a patch-bot usage is not possible.
And users get annoyed by the excessive output.
If we then have the same script that in a -pedantic mode generate
more noise - fine. But leave the default simple.
