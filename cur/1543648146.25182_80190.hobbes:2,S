I've applied most of this to my tree, except for the NOOP bits.  My 
concern is that the way you've implemented NOOP does not allow for all 
possible return codes to be passed in due to the error checking the 
iocb submit code performs on the inputs.  It can also spuriously fail 
if the filedescriptor field points to an fd that doesn't exist, which 
could be somewhat unexpected (especially if it is initialized to 0 by 
default, and therefore would not fail during normal operation where a 
program is run with stdin).  Got any idea for cleaning those problems 
up?
