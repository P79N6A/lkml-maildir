gnome-terminal should be an exact copy of the xterm codes without the
tek graphics extensions. Roughly speaking thats vt220. If you know of
any it gets wrong please file a bug report.
It should also be preserving tabs (WORKKSFORME 8)). People with 
replicable cases where it doesn't should stick them in gnome bugzilla.
https://bugzilla.gnome.org
. Konsole should also have the same properties
as xterm with regard to these features.
