It is just implemented wrong. It should use 
local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore() instead. But my bigger problem
with local_t is these few architectures (IA64, PPC64) who implement it 
with atomic_t. This means we can't replace local statistics counters
with local_t because it would be regression for them. I haven't done the
benchmarks yet, but I suspect both IA64 and PPC64 really should
just turn off interrupts.
