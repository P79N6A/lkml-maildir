	Hi;
	I just thought I would toss this in: For some classes
of users, latency is extremely critical. For example, people
making music live, doing realtime audio effects processing, or
recording audio. These people would probably like it below 2ms.
	mp3 playing latency requirements are very
loose-- the buffer takes up the slack, unless the latency is
insane.
	The good news is that for me, using the ck4 patchset,
my smp system is stable, and has a max latency of 3.5ms under
latencytest (during a make -j4 kernel compile no less) _and_
outperformed (slightly) virgin 2.4.19 on generic benchmarks.
(like building a kernel, bonnie,...)	
	Latency may not be the holy grail, but it remains
a valid requirement for a class of user. It may not merit
degredation for the common case, but perhaps it need not?

ps. ck4 uses the aa vm, but if there was a version with rmap,
I would test it.
