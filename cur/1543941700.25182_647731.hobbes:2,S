thank you good point out.
to be honest, the zone awareness of current mem_notify is premature.
I think we need enhancement rss statistics to per zone rss.
but not implemented yet ;-)
and, unfortunately I have no highmem machine.
the mem_notify is not so tested on highmem machine.
if you help to test, I am very happy!
Thanks.
