Using your glib sample thingy from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/inotify/glib/
  $ mkdir snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: snozzberries, a directory, was created
  $ rmdir snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: snozzberries, a directory, was deleted
  $ mkdir snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: bunneh, a directory, was created
  $ rm -r snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: The watch was opened
Also seen, watching a directory after some other traffic:
  $ mkdir snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: snozzberries, a directory, was created
  $ rm -r snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: The watch was opened
  Event on wd=0:  was closed (was not writable)
If I use absolute paths the rmdir/mkdir case is the same.
However:
  $ mkdir ~/tmp/snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: snozzberries, a directory, was created
  $ rm -r ~/tmp/snozzberries
  Event on wd=0: snozzberries was opened
