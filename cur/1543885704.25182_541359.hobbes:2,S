Subject: [PATCH] Cleanup libata HPA support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The original HPA patch that Kyle worked on has gone into current git
without some fixes that we worked through late in the Ubuntu feisty
release. Here's the main copy of the notes I sent to Alan a few weeks
ago in regards to the original patch, and a repatch against current git
to fix things up. Note we have released feisty with the patch attached
(albeit we have HPA enabled by default), and we have not had any reports
directly attributed to it. However, in gutsy (devel for next release,
based on current stock linux-2.6.git), we are already seeing reports of
the same issues we already fixed. 
The issues we saw were mainly that some controllers didn't return the
correct size from the SET_MAX command (sata_nv is a good example). So I
added a re IDENTIFY after the SET_MAX, and compared all the numbers. If
re-id was correct, but return value from SET_MAX wasn't we print a
warning and use the IDENTIFY value regardless (since that's what the
device is going to use).
Because we re IDENTIFY, there was also no need to keep n_sectors_boot
around, so that was removed. The ata_hpa_resize() was changed to handle
everything in a single call (checks for HPA support of the device, and
whether ignore_hpa is set or not), and it also sets dev->n_sectors
before returning.
So far with this patch, we were able to fix all the problems we were
seeing with it (except the sata_nv issue where we had to revert to not
using adma for NO_DATA transactions, already reported to libata-dev).
We've not had any reports of further problems.
