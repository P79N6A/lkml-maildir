You can do that, can have separate branches, distributed repository, any 
normal development tree can be an arch. You have reconcile among 
distributed versions, star-merge, patches replay or update in any 
direction. You choose what you want to merge, you can always list the 
missing patches, you can generate the needed patches to join the 
branches...

Patchsets are available too.

No fancy graphical tools, but great text tools by now.

Doable, BTW it's the normal way of working in arch.

That's what you are expected to do, you work in your code derived from a 
concret point in the, let's call, reference repository.
You can always see the differences, move them from one branch to the 
other, make the mavailable to others to "get"... No need to register 
anything, only to get a remote public archive you need to specify the 
location and version that you want to download.

You can't. But you can pull from the branches you need the patchsets you 
choose to. And make your branches public and available for others. It's 
very easy if you understand what's your development branch and your 
private branch. You move patches back and forth automatically. Even 
patches coming from the original trunk.
