I compiled my kernel (2.6.11) with the floppy driver as a module - so it
is not loaded on boot.  When the floppy driver is laoded, the LED
behaves as expected.  When I unload it, the LED stays in its current
state.  So if I do this...
# modprobe floppy; sleep 5; dd if=/dev/fd0 count=1 of=/dev/null; rmmod
floppy
...then the LED will be on when the driver is unloaded, so it will stay
that way until the driver is loaded again.
Its not at all important, and its probably known, but it doesn't look
very professional :).  Any thoughts?  Would it be possible to tell
whether the LED is on or not, and wait until its off?
