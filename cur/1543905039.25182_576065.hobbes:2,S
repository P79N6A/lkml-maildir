Unless I misunderstand the question, the "write" and "writev" function
of the "struct file_operations" should return an appropriate error value
(which is here -EACCES).
You may think of returning an error in the "open" if someone wants to
open it to write to it (so that the must open it read-only).
But I don't know if that is common practice or not (or even disliked) as
it may interfere with not properly implemented tools which open devices
read-write even if they never write to it.
