Subject: SCSI "asking for cache data failed"

I'm wondering about the following messages, which appeared when I upgraded from
2.4 to 2.6:
| sda: asking for cache data failed
| sda: assuming drive cache: write through
(a larger log snippet below)
I have found another message:
http://groups.google.com/group/fa.linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/853b2b5a5cc2f837/87bcabcf8a07f065
whosese author asks about whether this means that data inconsistencies can
appear. I also have a megaraid card, and a similar situation, but I have a
bit more general question.
I'm wondering WHY can't the caching mode cannot be obtained by the kernel?
 - Is it because the kernel is trying to inquire about the cache on a physical
   disk, and the sda and sdb it sees are actually logical drives, and the
   situation is perfectly normal?
 - Or is it something wrong with the card?
 - Or maybe there is no support for such operation in the megaraid
   driver?
 - Is it something else even? Do I need to do something more to find
   out?
The message is simply a little worrying for me, because I don't understand why
the "asking" fails.
here's some context:

This is kernel 2.6.12 with Debian patches.
