Sure there is: To the extent that there is a real license problem,
work with the copyright owner(s) for the files and binary blobs to
resolve the problem.  If the copyright owner intentionally contributed
them to Linux, they should be willing to resolve it by changing their
license.  Contrary to your (and SCO's) allegations, kernel gatekeepers
generally exercise care with respect to new contributions.
If you see a lit match in a movie theater, it is reasonable to ask the
person to put it out *before* you shout "fire" and evacuate.
