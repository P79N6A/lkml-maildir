Subject: specifics of aic7xxx-5.1.17-2.2.9.patch??

Hello....what is that the the aic7xxx-5.1.17 patch specifically fixes?  
I'm asking because I have a clone box with AHA-3944W's in it running RH v6.0
upgraded to v2.2.9.  I patched it with the aic7xxx-5.1.17-2.2.9.patch and
completely recompiled the kernel, but upon reboot, the system refuses to
come up.  The host isn't consistent on where it hangs on reboot either - it
will hang at INIT v2.74, the at daemon, modules dependencies.
(I have used v2.2.9 and the patch before on a few other hosts and it worked
without a problem.)
If someone could tell me specifically what it fixes, that would be greatly
appreciated.
Thank you!
Heather
