I did some more tests:
  - The problem also occurs when tarring up files from a disk on the Sym53c875.
  - The corrupted data always occurs at offset 32*x (the `+1' above was caused
    by hexdump, starting counting at 1).
  - The 32 bytes of corrupted data at offset 32*x are always a copy of the data
    at offset 32*x-10240.
  - Since 10240 is the default blocksize of tar (bug in tar?), I made a tarball
    on disk instead of on tape, but no corruption.
  - 32 is the size of a cacheline on PPC. Is there a missing cacheflush
    somewhere in the Sym53c875 driver? But then it should happen on disk as
    well?
