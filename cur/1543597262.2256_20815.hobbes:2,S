We need this, bad.  Two suggested changes:

All these macros are a waste of space :)
Much better to have:
#define VM_STAT_ZONE(zone, op)	zone->stat.op
Then, at the call site:
	VM_STAT_ZONE(some_zone, vm_pteunmap++);
Or, if you prefer,
#define VM_STAT_ZONE_INC(zone, field)	zone->field++
That way, you don't have to add a new macro each time
you add a new field.
Also, a sysrq key which dumps the stats out, please - when
your box has wedged there ain't no way you'll be running
vmstat.
