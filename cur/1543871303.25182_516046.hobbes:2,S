If you can restrict the virtual machine which AML runs in to a limited
amount of memory/storage, you can solve halting for it in exponential
time.
Unfortunately the problem here is even harder than halting. With the
halting problem you get all inputs beforehand. For AML, the locations
it accesses could be dependent on what it reads off of the hardware.
