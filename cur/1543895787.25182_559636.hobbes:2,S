Its worse. I get a hard hang (sysrq doesn't work) during boot, 
just when the system goes to read the partition table.
Recap: this is an older dual cpu intel box, with a vintage
HTP366 (and not a newer HPT370) on the system planar.  I'm
testing a configration that works fine with the old ide
drivers.
It looks like libata and scsi comes up. The disk is correctly
recognized; i.e. its brand, model number & size are correctly 
reported. printk shows that it hangs in msdos_partition, trying 
to read the partition table. The drive light is on full-solid,
again suggesting a possible irq storm.
Same behaviour for both 2.6.22-rc5-git1 and for 2.6.22-rc4-mm2
I seem to have trouble turning on scsi logging; it doesn't
seem to generate any output ... 
Any suggestions on how to proceed?
