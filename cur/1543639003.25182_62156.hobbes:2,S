I think you overstate the seriousness here - it's not unheard of for
manufacturers to ship hardware with duplicate MAC addresses - a trivial
search on Google turns up Cisco as one offender:

Worse than GE?

Being able to permanently fix a screwed up card that duplicated another
card on my LAN would be nice, imo.
Of course, this assumes that IEEE Station Address == MAC address.
