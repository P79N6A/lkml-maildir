Subject: where to put kernel code to run on exec?

I've added a field to the task struct to keep track of whether or not 
the process wants to be notified of various events.  On exec() I'd like 
to clear this field.
I'm having problems finding a nice clean place to put the code to clear 
it.  The obvious choice would be in the last bit of the success path in 
do_execve(), but there's nothing similar there already, so I'm probably 
missing something.
Is there some standard place to put code to run on a successful call to 
exec()?
