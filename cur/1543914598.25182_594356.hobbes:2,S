No, I'm not concerned about Vista.  Read: MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN BE AN OS.
 In fact, non-OS system software, such as bootloaders or diagnostic
systems, are in fact much more difficult in this than OSes.

They probably won't, which is highly unfortunate.  AMD is unlikely to
admit that they have a serious bug in their compliance, and BIOS vendors
are unlikely to catch on.  It's still broken.

To err is human (and, in silicon manufacturing, both common and
extremely expensive.)  It's now you deal with the fallout that matters,
and it's quite unforgiving, because we're dealing with computer
protocols here.  You MUST NOT advertise compliance with a protocol that
you don't actually have (MCFG).  You then SHOULD promulgate workarounds
that say "oh, I'm on chip X, that means that I can enable mmconfig as
long as I play within these chip-specific rules."

Uhm, it's hardware.  Bugs happen.  What gets ugly is when marketing gets
involved, and says "we can't afford to say we don't have <feature X>, so
let's advertise it anyway."
