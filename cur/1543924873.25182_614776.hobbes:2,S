I'm not in a position at the moment to test it as my IPoIB systems are offline, 
and not sure you are either, but I will note that with IPoIB bits circa OFED1.2 
the default MTU for IPoIB goes up to 65520 bytes.  If indeed the problem you 
were seeing was related to sub-mss sends and window probing and such, it might 
appear on IPoIB in addition to loopback.
