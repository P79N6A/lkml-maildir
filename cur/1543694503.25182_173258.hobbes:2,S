First to answer literally, the reasons are:
(1)  Everything else in this discussion have been public with additional
copies to individuals participating in the discussion.  (The same has been
true of most messages in other LKML discussions that I've seen.)
(2)  I didn't notice anything in your previous message that looked like it
needed to be kept secret, i.e. deliberately not posted publicly.
Now taking it non-literally, obviously I owe you an apology.  I should not
have quoted any of your words publicly without asking you first.  I am sorry
for quoting you without asking.
Now taking it intellectually, I am genuinely puzzled.  Sorry to repeat, but
I didn't notice anything in your previous message that looked like it needed
to be kept secret, i.e. deliberately not posted publicly.  Why was your
previous message private?
Sincerely,
Norman Diamond
