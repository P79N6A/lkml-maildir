It is impossible to compile a network device driver which uses code from
8390.c into the kernel and another one as a module, because the 8390
module isn't built and installed then (but required by the modularized
driver). For example, building ne2k-pci into the kernel and ne as a
module doesn't work.
Perhaps this should be documented somewhere, or caught by configure
process.
