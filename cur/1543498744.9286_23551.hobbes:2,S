You _can't_ use it with your wake_up_sem(). I just thought about that. But
I think it would be better to do a real FIFO instead of your goodness
approch. We should have a way to choose which kind of wakeup to do on
waitqueues. And now that waitqueues are double linked list choosing
between FIFO and LIFO should be trivial.
