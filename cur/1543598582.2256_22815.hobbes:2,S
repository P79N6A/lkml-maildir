I have not received a reply to either of my two bug reports.
Investigating, I have found a little more out.  Basically
It comes down to the two video cards.  When I boot with PCI
as the primary card Linux crashes.  When I set it to one card
then it boots.  The problem occurs with all kernels at least from 
2.4.6 - 2.4.9.
The kernel does get past the Synchronization, etc, just fine.
I have tried both FB and non-FB code. I suspect that it is a
VGA/Video-SMP 
initialization interation issue since I can boot non-SMP kernels fine.
Is there anything that I should do to narrow this down more?
I would appreciate any help with this.  I have not yet had a response
from
the mailing list.
