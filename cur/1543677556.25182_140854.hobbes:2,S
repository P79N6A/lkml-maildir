I don't know what this magicdev thing is, but from what you say you
turned off I assume it's something that accesses the CD drive and
polls its status regularly.  So your problem looks remarkably like
mine, which I have already reported here, except I do get a panic.  My
problem occurs when the GNOME 2 CD applet is running, and it seems to
me the culprit is an ioctl() that tries to get the status of the
drive.  Look for my message with "Subject: Still [OOPS] ide-scsi
panic, now in 2.4.21 too" (just reposted it, first time only went to
specific people).
  Glad to know I'm not alone :-)
Roland.
