Is there any chance you could try bisecting the problem? Either just 
binary-searching the patches or by using the git bisect helper scripts?
Obviously the git approach needs a "good" kernel in git, but if 
2.6.13-rc4-mm1 is ok, then I assume that 2.6.13-rc4 is ok too? That's a 
fair number of changes:
	 git-rev-list v2.6.13-rc4..v2.6.13-rc6 | wc
	    340     340   13940
but if you can tighten it up a bit (you already had trouble at rc5, I 
think), it shouldn't require testing more than a few kernels.
Git has had bisection support for a while, but the helper scripts to use 
it sanely are fairly new, so I think you'd need the git-0.99.4 release for 
those. But then you'd just do
	git bisect start
	git bisect bad v2.6.13-rc5
	git bisect good v2.6.13-rc4
and start bisecting (that will check out a mid-way point automatically, 
you build it, and then do "git bisect bad" or "git bisect good" depending 
on whether the result is bad or good - it will continue to try to find 
half-way points until it has found the point that turns from good to 
bad..)
