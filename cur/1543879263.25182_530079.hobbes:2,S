That is a fairly significant and sudden change to the existing
kernel/user interface.

This is untrue. The process can get there (via fd passing with another
task) and the process can be producing output for the human operators,
who most definitely need to know and see this stuff.

I don't think this is fit to apply in current form. The hiding of mounts
and mountstats is the wrong approach. The changes to getcwd behaviour
bother me too as we are changing user space behaviour without warning.
The general idea of pushing some of the fail detect logic into __d_path()
seems good though.
