There's a dependency between SERIO and KEYBOARD_ATKBD that must be 
represented in the config rules.
Let me paraphrase the dependency the other way round (I'm not sure 
whether the syntax is 100% correct):
config KEYBOARD_ATKBD
	tristate "AT keyboard support" if EMBEDDED || !X86 
	default y
	depends on INPUT_KEYBOARD
	select SERIO=m
	select SERIO=y if KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
	help
	  ...
