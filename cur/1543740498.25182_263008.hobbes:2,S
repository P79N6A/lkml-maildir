You use a semaphore to protect data, a completion isn't protecting data
but preserving a certain kind of wait ordering in the code. The
possibility of overloading the current mutex_t for PI makes for a conceptual
mismatch when used in this case since having a kind of priority for
completions is a bit odd. It's better to flat out use a completion
instead, IMO.
