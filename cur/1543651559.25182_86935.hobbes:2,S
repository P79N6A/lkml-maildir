There is too much in it.
You got ALI chipset and there is a lot of problems with ALI chipsets
- I got a serious one (no PCMCIA) myself.
I suggest you to search the archive for 
ALI and IRQ
There is a patch in pci-irq.c for broken HP Pavilion BIOS (ALI chipset
as well) - if your problem is similar - may work for you.
good luck,
Jacek
