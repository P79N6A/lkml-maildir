Please don't put page clustering anywhere near that blacklist. There's
a lot more to it than "gee, wli shrank mem_map[] again".

Maybe some way to get feedback to/from cpu vendors about this would
help. If we really want to kill highmem dead in 2.7, beating cpu
vendors with a baseball bat until they^W^W^W^W^W^W^W^Wkindly asking
cpu vendors to kill that fucking PAE shit dead (goddammit!) might help.
