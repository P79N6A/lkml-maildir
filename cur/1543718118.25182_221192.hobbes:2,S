Subject: [2.6.5, ext3] getdents reports files that stat says aren't there

I keep getting this effect on my ext3 file system.
Applications like ls call readdir, get long deleted files, then stat
them, and get ENOENT.
Most applications can handle this, but some report ugly errors or
warnings.  I wonder: why does getdents report entries of deleted files?
I ran e2fsck on the partition, but it found nothing.  So I guess it's
not a file system error.  I have been seeing this for months now.  It
does not actually hurt a lot, but I think it should be fixed
nonetheless.
