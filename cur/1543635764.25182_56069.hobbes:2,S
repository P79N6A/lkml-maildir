Yes, thanks, I was in fact feeling a little guilty about proposing that
non-nested solution, even if it would in practice point you at the
correct culprit most of the time.
So in schedule() we check the task struct field and oops if it's non-null.
In other words, one instance of SLEEPS goes in shedule() and others are
sprinkled around the kernel as executable documentation.

What is the problem?  It looks like (struct thread_info *) can be forward
declared, and hence current_thread_info and get_current can be defined
early.  Maybe I didn't sniff at enough architectures.
Anyway, if there are nasty dependencies then they are probably similar
to the ones I unravelled with my early-page patch, which allows struct
page to be declared right at the start of mm.h instead of way later,
below a lot of things that want to reference it.

And since the stack is chained through the locks, that just works.

Yes, that one's already been rejected as largely pointless.
