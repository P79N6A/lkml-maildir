Yes, I'm using 2.2.1 with Tronds nfsv2-wsize-0.9 patch and mounting 3
NFS volumes from a Digital Unix 3.2 box.
(mount options=rw,bg,hard,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192; one volume has
additional actimeo=0 because noac didn't work for me)

The server didn't crash.

Which version of DU? What mount options do you use? NFS v3?
