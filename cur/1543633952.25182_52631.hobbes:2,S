First of all, _that_ is still recursive.  And it's not easy to deal with -
you need to release the object holding the link body (BTW, that can
be almost anything - page, inode, kmalloc'ed area, vmalloc'ed area, etc.)
after __vfs_follow_link() is done.  And that means (at the very least)
a stack of such objects, along with the information about their nature.
Which exposes a lot of information about the filesystem guts - so much
that we are basically introducing a cookie created by your ->prepare_...()
and having a destructor of its own.
I'd implemented that variant about 3 years ago.  And it got vetoed by Linus -
for a very good reason.  It was too damn ugly, with more ugliness to come
as we add more filesystems.

D'oh.  Indeed it is wrong - not to mention anything else, if we keep it
over the lifetime of struct block_device, there is no possible reason
to recalculate it.  Sure thing, it's cached.  And stays cached until
we are either told that it needs to be reread (BLKRRPART or your ioctls)
or that device itself is gone or that we didn't have that device (or
any of its partitions) for a long time, all their page caches are evicted
from memory and memory pressure is so bad that we want to start dropping
ancient and long-unused struct block_device.
Normal case is that we read partition table once - on the first open().
Then it stays cached.

Sure - why would it?  If we already know where partition is - why would
we bother rereading that stuff?

FSVO "permanent".  Basically, struct block_device of entire disk is
going to be a lot more long-living beast than it is right now...
