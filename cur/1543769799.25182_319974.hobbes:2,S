Actually it has
http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/dvdrtools/
It's a fork of the last "free" cdrecord (as in, without #ifdef NOT_MY_VERSION 
printf("Warning, you're using broken crap") and eliminates quite a few 
braindamages, such as the build system, the absence of DVD support, the 
anti-Linux and anti-GNU-Make comments and associated delays, but is otherwise 
still pretty close to the original (help in fixing the rest of the rest is 
welcome!).
