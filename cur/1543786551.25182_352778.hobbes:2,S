Gene,
In order to update your copy of the kernel repository just run "git pull".
   Unfortunately there still seem to be some issues with kernel.org,
hopefully that'll be fixed up soon.
The warning you're getting from git about "alternates" will be fixed in
the next release of git.   You _could_ use your current version of git to
track the official git repository and get this fix before it's officially
released:
$ cd ~
$ git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ git-repo
$ cd git-repo
$ git checkout
$ make install
Which should upgrade your current version of git to the very latest. 
After which you can upgrade git whenever you like by running:
$ cd ~/git-repo
$ git pull
$ make install
Cheers,
Sean
