Subject: PROBLEM: Both 2.2.7-pre4 and 2.2.6-ac3 fail to boot on SparcStation 10

After compiling the listed (pre)releases of the Kernel, booting
freezes after the "Booting Linux..." message. Not even "BREAK" to
get to the PROM works anymore, the system needs a cold start.
This happens both with SMP and UP kernels.
2.2.5-ac4 works quite happily after i fixed the unresolved symbol
in fs/proc/mem.c (as reported earlier to the sparclinux mailing list).
From looking at the patches in question, both contain a lot of SPARC-related
changes, especially in the startup and irq-handling code.
Could it be that those two patches are missing some SPARC-related stuff?
Yours,
