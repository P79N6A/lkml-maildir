Let's just set the record straight. I actually discussed cpusets over a year 
ago in this nonsense and was told by sgi folk there was no need to get my 
head around cpusets and honouring node placement should be enough which, by 
the way, swap prefetch does. So I by no means ignored this; we just hit an 
impasse on just how much more featured it should be for the sake of a goddamn 
home desktop pc feature.
Anyway why the hell am I resurrecting this thread? The code is declared dead 
already. Leave it be.
