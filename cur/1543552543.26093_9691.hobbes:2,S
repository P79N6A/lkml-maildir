I don't follow. The patch avoids to lose the high 32bit of information
during the setattr call. I'm not limiting anything, I'm just allowing
the server to see the whole information that cames from the client.

NFS server needs to open with O_LARGEFILE to go over 2G. Currently
it does that unconditionally (nfsv2 can't ask over 4G by design anyways,
and in lfs in 2.2.18pre17aa1 we put an hard limit of 2G for nfsv2 clients
to avoid triggering bugs with any other non-linux server, if you need
more than 2G just use nfsv3).
