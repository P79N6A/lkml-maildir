The only way this would happen at atalk_unregister_sysctl is if the 
kmalloc failed on register_sysctl_table during init.  In that case there 
is no need to unregister atalk in the first place since it never came up, 
so this doesn't appear to be the correct fix.  Even if it were possible, 
this check should be done at atalk_exit instead of 
atalk_unregister_sysctl.
