Nods.  No such thing in Ubuntu; and they just tore out most of their
kernels due to management overhead, saying that you should install the
BigIron (giant x86 servers with tens of gigs of memory) kernel if you
want PAE.  Of course, the BigIron kernel is for a server and doesn't
have nice low-latency features (our default desktop kernel is a 250HZ
VOLUNTARY_PREEMPT one, the low-latency kernel has 1000HZ PREEMPT; I
always thought 1000HZ PREEMPT was a good desktop default).
Things like preempt or PAE adjustment at boot time are awesome pipe
dreams, but none of them are awesomely possible/easy.  Distro
maintainers don't seem to want to supply 30 combinations ....
