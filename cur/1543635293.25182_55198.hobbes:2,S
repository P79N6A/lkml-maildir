I believe Linux-ATM on sourceforge 
http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/
I noticed you posted this same question there a month ago...
Developers of Linux-ATM on SourceForge
Werner Almesberger  almesber    almesber at users.sourceforge.net
Mitchell Blank Jr   mblank      mblank at users.sourceforge.net
Paul B. Schroeder   paulsch     paulsch at users.sourceforge.net
You could sign up as a developer to that project on
sourceforge and make CVS changes there.
Of course you could always send the patches to the lk list
and/or you could become the maintainer.

I've got some feature enhancement patches for ATM and SONET drivers, as well
as
an API enhancement to support VBR traffic shaping.
Who is the appropriate person to send them to?  I don't see an entry in
MAINTAINERS for ATM/SONET.
