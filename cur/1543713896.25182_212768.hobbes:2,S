I've been thinking about it.
I guess our page remap patches would be overkill for your purpose.
Point of our patches is that:
   1. Blocks new access to a specified page.
   2. Waits for the page going into quiescent state.
   3. Copies data from the page to a new page and exchanges them.
In my understanding you want to handle only anonymous pages
which don't have backing store yet. This means that you only need
step 3.

If you use the HW assisted hot page detection, just notify our remapping
functions of hot pages directly. Everything would be handled well and
pagefault handler would be blocked by PG_lock bit.
