Hello Ed !
Thanks for the feedback.

Your explanation makes sense to me. With this information I built the
table:
   IGNPAR    INPCK         ACTION:
     0         0           Deliver all data to the user-level
     0         1           Check parity. Discard erroneous bytes
     1         0           ????
     1         1           Check parity. Discard erroneous bytes 
What goes on ????   ?

When the driver copy the data from the controler to the flip buffer it
copies the data to the buffer tty->flip.char_buf_ptr and it set a flag
(TTY_NORMAL, TTY_PARITY, TTY_FRAME, etc) on the buffer
tty->flip.flag_buf_ptr telling the TTY how this byte was received. So
the TTY knows if certain byte was problematic or not. Did you understand
my doubt know ?
Thanks for your patience
Henrique
