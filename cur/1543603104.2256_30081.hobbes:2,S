I'm just dumb.  The message was new, but the behavior (non-APIC
interrupts) was not.  I'm truly sorry for any confusion.
I was trying to track down another problem (the PNPBios issue that looks
to have been patched and an ALSA driver issue) when I just saw the
message, which I had never seen before.
Sorry.
