If you only have a couple of integers to set, you can probably
get away with atomic operations.  Without knowing more though,
I'm not sure what else to suggest.  But here's my advice:
-if you are checking against these values often, a rwlock is
 probably the best choice (e.g. while(var < end) { foo() };)
-if you check begin+end once, atomic ops are the way to go
 (e.g. start = buf+begin ; count = end-start)
-if you have to update begin/end non-atomically and check them
 only once, use a spinlock, it's the least expensive lock
