It would be great to have a Linux "Build Verification Test"
(pronounced "bee vee tee" in the testing world) suite.  The 
suite verifies that all essencial system functions are working
within the bounds of normal, correct usage.  BVTs could be 
written on a subsystem by subsystem basis.  The Test Script
Manager would check to see what hardware was detected at boot
time by examining "dmesg" (if Linux ever gets a full 
implementation of Plug and Play, the script could perform
PNP detection).  Then the Test Script Manager could fire off 
tests as appropriate.  The Script Manager should support 
selecting various test suite profiles:
	Build Verification Testing
	Stress Testing
	Application Testing (we'd need some sort of 
		test harness that would allow scripted 
		driving of applications through both X 
		and command shells)
	And so on...

Well said.  And much more succinctly than I.  :-)
