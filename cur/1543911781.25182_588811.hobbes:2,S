Yupe, using AHCI.
I've just rebooted after adding that blacklist line to the kernel and
recompiling but it doesn't seem to have taken effect:
  ata1: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
  ata1.00: ATA-7: WDC WD800BEVS-07RST0, 04.01G04, max UDMA/133
  ata1.00: 156301488 sectors, multi 1: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)
If NCQ is disabled/blacklisted shouldn't the depth say 0/32 ?
I used the string "WDC WD800BEVS-07" in the patch, maybe I should use
"WDC WD800BEVS-07RST0" instead?
cat /sys/bus/scsi/devices/0\:0\:0\:0/model shows "WDC WD800BEVS-07"
