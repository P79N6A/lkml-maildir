If my memory serves well, you wrote once long ago that your project needs
the "legacy" value to make things work.
Kernel 2.4 guessed usually legacy, right? 
Kernel 2.6 returns extended and it more upsets tools and users with
trashed partitions.
So a simple question: why is returning the extended values better than
returning always the legacy values (or even the previous guess)?
I _do_ know that that won't be perfect either but perhaps it weren't so
broken as it is now. 
BTW, so far nobody answered what the technical benefit returning the
extended values instead of the legacy ones or the previous guess. 
We only know the current values hurt more and there are only better
alternatives, right?
