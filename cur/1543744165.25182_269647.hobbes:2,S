But you can't flush the fifo from that callback, you don't have any
locking on it. What are you locking semantics ? Define them, versus
open, versus close, versus other I/O.

So you want to replace a tasklet that responds to the event with a
tasklet which is called by the event ? Tell me how they differ when low
latency is set on the tty - I don't see any difference in performance

If you can't define the locking semantics, its not viable anyway. I see
two things we can do usefully here. The first is to teach
tty_flip_buffer_push more about urgency - since the new tty code I'm
running/crashing/debugging has a real packet queue not just flip buffers
we can queue a tiny message to the queue front and we can probably begin
to cheat a bit more on low_latency v immediate.
