[... applies to Kernels 2.4.0 test4, test5 at least ...]
On my system, kapmd is using up a lot of cpu.  Is this the normal state
of affairs? I mean, are cycles consumed by kapmd run in power-save
mode?  If so, I can live with it. 
Otherwise, this looks like a bug. 
$ uptime
  1:21pm  up 19 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.01, 0.02, 0.00
$ ps aux|grep kapmd
root         2 39.7  0.0     0    0 ?        SW   13:01   8:02 [kapmd]
In other words, 8 minutes of consumed CPU time in 19 minutes of uptime.
My only complaint if this is the correct behavior, is that the system
loadavg goes up when system is idle.  This seems strange.  Load
monitoring programs will be fooled, and programs that want to run when
system is idle might be fooled (although I don't seriously think the
latter could happen, given that the scheduler can take of this more
precisely anyway).
Here is my system in any case:
