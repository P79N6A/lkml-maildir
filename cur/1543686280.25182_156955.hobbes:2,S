Oops, I overlooked the change.  Tried it with a relatively
stripped-down 22-rc2 build (slimmed the vmlinuz down by about 100K),
but that made no difference.  I popped a CMD648-based card in, disabled
the on-board Promise chip, and it booted right up and works fine with
22-rc2.  So if the .id -> .present is the only change that affected the
Promise driver (I did some looking for obvious, but gave up after
realizing that unless the change actually had a /* borks Promise IDE
controllers*/ in it I wouldn't be likely to recognize it), then I guess
that's it.

Does this really mean that the Promise has been running at only 33MHz
all along, and that with this fix it stopped choking the speed and
that's the cause of the problem?  I know that back when I first setup
this drive on the Promise (over a year ago - I'm pretty sure I was
runnign 2.2.latest back then and had to jumper the drive to get around
the 64K cylinders problem) I know I saw transfer speeds greater than
33MB reported by hdparm -T.
Okay, for completeness I should back out that change and retest it with
the Promise, and I'll try to remember to throw a quick throughput test
in just to see what it's been doing to me.  ;-)
BTW, yes, I am (and have been) using an 80-pin cable with this drive.
