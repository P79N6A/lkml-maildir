I have ASUS A7V266-E (AS99127F chip) and lm_sensors 2.6.2
shows 43 C for CPU without any additional lines in /etc/sensors.conf
Which sounds reasonable.   However this temperature is rarely ever change !
I typically have 43.1,   sometimes 42.8   and that's it.   Even after 2-3 min
compiles.    So something is wrong
