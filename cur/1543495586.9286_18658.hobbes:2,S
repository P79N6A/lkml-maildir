Linus said:

If you are coming to Linux Expo, we will have a booth and at that booth
we will have BitKeeper, docs on BitKeeper, and a pass at the linux kernel
all shoved into one repository.  Please stop by and check it out.  
There will also be a BitKeeper BOF, I think it is 7:30PM Thursday, which
is where you should come to get an overview of BK and to discuss its usage
for the kernel development process.  Please attend it you can.
: BitKeeper doesn't imply any quality assurance either, but it _should_ make
: it easier to keep in sync.
That's the plan and I think we'll get there pretty soon.  I suspect we
will have growing pains but BitMover is prepared to focus almost 100%
of its engineers (we're up to 4) on making this stuff work for the Linux
kernel team.
See you at Linux Expo!
