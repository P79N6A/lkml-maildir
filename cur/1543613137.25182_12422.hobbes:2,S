The multi queue scheduler i'm currently working on uses a balancing method
that relies on a metric table :
unsigned char cpus_dmap[NR_CPUS][NR_CPUS];
that lists metrics between CPUs, ie :
metric(I, J) = F(cpus_dmap[I][J])
and this is the easy part.
How to detect CPUs that are "near" ( on the same bus/mb ) on x86/ia64 hardware ?
Is the MP configuration data structured in a way that makes you understand
this mapping, ie :
HDR-ENTRY
BUS-ENTRY
CPU-ENTRY
...
BUS-ENTRY
...
