	I'm still working in a cache filesystem for linux 2.2. think 
that most of problems solved, but have a little problem with inode 
number assignment
	My idea is that make any cache-pending entry in cache directory
is defined by mean a device special file. this device performs these ops:
- when inode_read, stat, lookup or so, look into cached filesystem and
  fill inode data properly
- when read, readdir, mmap or so, ask daemon to make a cache copy of
  requested file/directory. When cache copy is done replace special file
  with retrieved data and complete system call
My problem: inode number changes between special file and cached file, and
don't know how to inform VFS about this change. So i'm trying to do any of
these items:
- Try to force inode number on cachefs daemon ( that runs in user space )
  to the one owned by the special file, when caching is done
- Try to notify VFS that older inode number is no longer valid an force to
  use new one
- Try to make a reverse stat(2) call to change status of a given inode
  ( eg change it from special file to regfile/directory/symlink or so )
Is any of these items possible? how to make it?. Perhaps this is not the
correct way to work...
	Any suggestions will be welcomed
