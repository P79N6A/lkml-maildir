OK, I backed out those 4, and the degredation mostly went away.
See 
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/abat/perf/kernbench.moe.png
and more specifically, see the +p5150 near the right hand side.
I don't think it's quite as good as mainline, but much closer.
I did this run with HZ=1000, and the the one with no scheduler
patches at all with HZ=250, so I'll try to do a run that's more
directly comparable as well
Thanks,
M.
