Don't believe everything you read in comments.  That one is very out of 
date.  It should be removed.

Wrong.  usb_root_hub_lost_power does _not_ mark the ports as gone, and 
it does _not_ tell khubd to disconnect them.  (Depending on which 
version of the kernel you are looking at -- I'm referring to the latest 
development kernel including the gregkh-all patch set.  Earlier 
versions did behave the way you describe.)

So the system is behaving the way you want, but not for the reason you 
think.  I bet you could remove the call to usb_root_hub_lost_power() 
entirely and it wouldn't make any difference at all.
