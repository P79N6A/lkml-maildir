This reference describes roughly what I had in mind for active 
defragmentation, which depends on reverse mapping.  The main additional
wrinkle I'd contemplated is introducing a new ZONE_LARGE, and GPF_LARGE,
which means the caller promises not to pin the allocation unit for long
periods and does not mind if the underlying physical page changes
spontaneously.  Defragmenting in this zone is straightforward.
