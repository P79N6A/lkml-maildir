Despite a fairly specific case, I'd still like to get the problem fixed
for 2.6.23. I've posted up an alternative fix under the subject "Use one
zonelist per node instead of multiple zonelists v2". It's a more invasive
fix although arguably it's better overall than the hack because it's not
dealing with a specific special case and has a sensible path forward that
makes policies a saner ultimately. However, unlike the hack it affects all
callers of the page allocator so lets see what the reaction from reviewers
is before forgetting about the hack altogether.
