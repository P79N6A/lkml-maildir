Which is refuted only by your personal experience, not by any facts that have 
yet been posted.

This has gone too far. I said NO such thing. I repeatedly stated in previous 
emails that the decision was based on code that, _although not perfect on 
submission_ could most rapidly be made to work. You have just twisted what 
I've said here to contradict that. Please read ALL of my emails, instead of 
selectively attacking only what you disagree with.
( I also don't appreciate being copied back onto LKML, after a long email 
diatribe (which you selectively did not copy). It's just bad netiquette. )

I certainly wouldn't expect my code to be taken. If somebody else's was taken, 
I would accept that I was powerless to make them do otherwise. That's what 
benevolent dictatorships are all about and what somebody familiar with Linux 
development should expect.
The best way to deal with "injustices" is to constructively move past them. 
Con decided to leave the community, and that's another option. I just think 
everybody's lost out, himself included.

LKML isn't _normally_ a place for compassion, but for code, and I'm pretty 
sure that if there was less compassion we'd have fewer flamewars and less of 
the petty politics that you are complaining so loudly about.
Either you can convince Linus to change his mind, or you can't. Complaining 
about it will achieve nothing other than to increase the noise to signal on 
LKML.
