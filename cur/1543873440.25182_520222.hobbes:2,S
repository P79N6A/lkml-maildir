One of us is confused, and it may very well be me, but...
the /bin/tar -f - >/tmp/test/ looks to me like it should fail exactly as
bash says it does. the output redirect (>) will only write out to a
file, not a directory. (So, /tmp/file should work, /tmp/file/ won't.)
Are you trying to redirect where the files get restored? That should be
done with a cd before doing the uncompress.
Or am I misunderstanding what you're telling me?
