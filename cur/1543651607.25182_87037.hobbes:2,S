After seing your ACPI bios I cannot find out the reason why it 
interferes with the USB subsystem.
The failed commands happen when sonypi tries to access the 0x62
and 0x66 ports, which are (wrongly) reserved by the keyboard 
(this is why sonypi cannot reserve them). These registers are
also used by ACPI 'Embedded Controller'.
But I still cannot understand what the USB does in this area.
You didn't say if you compiled in the ACPI susbystem. Does it
change something if you do not compile it (in case you did
previously) or if you do compile it (in case you didn't) ?
