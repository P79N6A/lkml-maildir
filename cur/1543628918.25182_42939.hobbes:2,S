Please note that ->read_inode2() is reiserfs-specific hack. Adding more
users for it would make it permanent. The only reason for ->read_inode2
existence was that iget() was called by code external to the
file-system, knfsd used to do this, now it can call ->fh_to_dentry() in
stead. As iget() is never called outside of file-ssytem, you can set
ntfs->read_inode to no-op and write your own function ntfs_iget(...) to
be called from ntfs_lookup() and ntfs_fill_super().
ntfs_iget() calls iget() (->read_inode is no-op, hence iget doesn't
access disk) and, if new inode were allocated, reads data from the disk
and initializes inode, etc.
I guess coda_iget() is example of this.
