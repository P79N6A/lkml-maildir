Yes, this is a biggie.  It needs one of:
    * fix gcc
    * post-process the .s file
    * drop support for stack-protector (does it really help? do people
      use it?)

I don't see the problem.  The way i386 does it inherently supports
per-cpu data very early on (it uses the prototype percpu section until
the real percpu values are set up).

I don't see that's terribly important.  percpu references aren't all
that common overall, and - at least on x86 - using a 16-bit offset
(assuming its possible) would require a prefix anyway, so it would only
save 1 byte per reference.  But I can't convince gas to generate a
16-bit offset anyway.

The asm used to generate these references is inherently arch-specific
anyway, so the type and size of offset needed from the per-cpu base
register to the data itself can be arch-dependent without loss of
generality.  
I definitely see that small offsets might be useful for other
architectures, but for x86 it doesn't help and makes things more
complex.  The only difference between 32- and 64-bit is whether we
generate an offset from %fs, %gs or nothing (for the UP case).

I was never quite sure what that was for.
