Then my comment above is bad.  Should add that it frees the old block.

My code is bad probably.  I should return if malloc() fails.

Memory managment is annoying.  I'm working on a reference counting 
scheme on the side; but that's a fair bit of overhead.  I've never been 
able to argue that reference counting is less overhead than manual mm; 
but I've also never been able to argue that trying to guess if you can 
free memory based on your program's internal state is less overhead than 
reference counting.
There's places where this is inappropriate, and places where it's 
appropriate.  Inside the kernel, though, I can't imagine where it'd be 
appropriate.   . . . yeh this is a bad idea, isn't it?  :p

The function isn't made to segfault; segfaulting is what happens when 
you screw up your code.  :)
I guess it should describe INPUT, OUTPUT, PROCESS, STATE CHANGE, and 
ERRORS :/

Readable.  Don't guess what the code does.

Of course not.  The goal I was aiming for was to create an extremely 
structured documentation scheme in the hopes that it would provide a 
great deal of ease in understanding what a function does.  "if you don't 
understand what it does, don't fuck with my code"
