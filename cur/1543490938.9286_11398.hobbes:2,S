	Not necessarily.  You can fairly easily do dynamic major
	number assignment, and then use a tool which does essentially:
	MAJOR=`cat /proc/devices | grep YourDeviceName | cut -c-4`
	for MINOR in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
	do
	    mknod -m 0600 /dev/octo$MINOR c $MAJOR $MINOR
	done
	That's all.
	(Or you can support the devfs subsystem by Richard Goosh (sp?)
	 and use its registration functions to get all device entries
	 automagically.)
	Of course, while /dev/ directory is persistent storage (except
	with  devfs), dynamically assigned major number for a dynamically
	loaded module might not be the same every time..
