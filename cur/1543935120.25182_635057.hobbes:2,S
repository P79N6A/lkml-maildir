Heh heh, that can be dealt with by skipping the first chain if the first
chain is empty after chaining.  Please take a look at
ata_sg_setup_extra() in the following.
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tj/libata-dev.git;a=blob;f=drivers/ata/libata-core.c;h=32dde5bbc75ed53e89ac17040da2cd0621a37161;hb=c8847e473a4a2844244784226eb362be10d52ce9
That said, yeah, it's seriously ugly.  Restoring the original sg is ugly
too.  I definitely agree that we need some improvements here.
