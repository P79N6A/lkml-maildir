As our press announcement said, XFS will be released in open source.
That does not contradict/preclude its being structured as a loadable
module. XFS is a pretty large file system (100k+ lines of code) and
it wouldn't be reasonable for something that large to be statically
linked with the kernel, as there are probably lots of applications
and configurations that don't need its capabilities.
I hope this clarifies things.
