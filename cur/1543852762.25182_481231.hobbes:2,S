Hi, I just upgraded my workstation to 2.6.18.2. It has four SATA
drives in a RAID10, connected to the system in pairs on Promise and
Via on-board controllers.
Now on every boot, I see several messages like this for the drives
connected to the VIA controller (VT6420):
  ata2.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
  ata2.00: tag 0 cmd 0xb0 Emask 0x2 stat 0x50 err 0x0 (HSM violation)
  ata1.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
  ata1.00: tag 0 cmd 0xb0 Emask 0x2 stat 0x50 err 0x0 (HSM violation)
What do these mean?
Also, for the first of the two drives on the Promise/FastTrak
PDC20378 controller, I see messages like this:
  ata3: translated ATA stat/err 0x50/00 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/00/00
What about those?
I saw none of that under 2.6.17.x. Should I be worried?

the unix philosophy basically involves
giving you enough rope to hang yourself.
and then some more, just to be sure.
