This is wrong. SIGKILL can be sent "internally", for example by
do_group_exit().

This is not right too. It is possible that init had a handler when
the signal was sent, and the handler was set to SIG_DFL before the
signal was dequeued.

No need to check signal_group_exit(signal). It was needed to
handle SIGKILL when it is sent by do_group_exit()/de_thread().
With this patch this is covered by sig_kernel_only().
Personally, I'd prefer to retain this check inline with a small
comment
		/* SMALL COMMENT ;) */
		if (unlikely(signal->flags & SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE) &&
		    !sig_kernel_only(signr))
			continue;
