Warning: there is a big difference between *can* and *want*.  On ia64
machines with an Intel chipset, the PCI DMA interface is implemented
via bounce buffers, so it will be *much* slower than DAC.  For this
reason, it is preferable on ia64 to use DAC where possible (and just
in case Dave Miller starts asking about this: yes, the hp zx1 chipset
for Itanium 2 does have a hardware I/O TLB... ;-).
