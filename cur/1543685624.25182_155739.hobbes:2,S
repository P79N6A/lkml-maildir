You are confused, but it seems you are not alone.  I don't understand
where this talk of ABI came from.
There are two patches.  Both reduce the size of the "struct rcu_head".
One simply changes the struct rcu_head from a double linked list to a
single linked list.  The other eliminates the "void *data" arg, and
changes the prototype of the call_rcu() function to take a pointer to
the struct rcu_head, rather than a user-defined data ptr.
It is the latter that I am concerned about changing mid-stable-series.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
