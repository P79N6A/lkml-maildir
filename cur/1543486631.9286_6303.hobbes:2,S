I've seen it on two machines now so I decided to try and
track it down. When there is no keyboard plugged, the kernel
gets stuck right after the Loading linux...... from LILO.
I tracked it down to empty_8042 in arch/i386/boot/setup.S:758
How do you tell the difference between a broken 8042 and
no keyboard present? I added a limit to the number of times
the code could loop and the kernel booted fine. It's been
working fine ever since.
Is this the right solution or is there something better?
