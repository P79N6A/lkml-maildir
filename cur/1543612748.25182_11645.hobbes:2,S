I've noticed a couple more things with the memory allocation problem
with large buffer and cache allocation. Some applications will fail
with ENOMEM *even if* there is a considerable amount (say, 62 MB as
below) of "truly" free memory.
The second thing I've noticed is that all these apps that die with
ENOMEM pretty much have the same strace output towards the end. What
is strange is "display *.tif" dies while "ee *.tif" and "gimp *.tif"
does not. Piping the strace output of commands that *don't* cause this
behavior and grepping for modify_ldt shows that modify_ldt is *not*
being called for apps that *don't* die.
So I don't know if it's a symptom or a cause, but modify_ldt seems to be
triggering the problem. Not being a kernel hacker, I leave the analysis
of this to those who are.
