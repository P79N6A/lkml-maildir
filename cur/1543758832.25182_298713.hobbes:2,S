Certainly -mm can be the feature tree, but i've noticed that not that many 
people run -mm aside from developers. Meaning that a fair number of bugs 
seep into Linus' tree before they get attended to. It would even be more 
effective if we could get more -mm user coverage. A Linus based odd number 
might be closer to that if we hope on people unwittingly running them.
