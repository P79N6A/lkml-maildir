	It does. Kernel is not a separate process and system call is
served on the same processor where the process runs. What the original
article probably refered to is the kernel_lock. It doesn't cover
everything, so saying that there can't be two processors actually running
in the kernel mode is wrong. But it still covers too many places in the
kernel. Bottom halves are SMP-safe, so they may run on *all* processors
simultaneously.
