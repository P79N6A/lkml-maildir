I think it'd be a good idea to merge scheduler classes before changing
over the policy so future changes to policy have smaller code impact.
Basically, get scheduler classes going with the mainline scheduler.
There are other pieces that can be merged earlier, too, for instance,
the correction to the comment in init/main.c. Directed yields can
probably also go in as nops or -ENOSYS returns if not fully implemented,
though I suspect there shouldn't be much in the way of implementing them.
p->array vs. p->on_rq can be merged early too. Common code for rbtree-
based priority queues can be factored out of cfq, cfs, and hrtimers.
There are extensive /proc/ reporting changes, large chunks of which
could go in before the policy as well.
I'm camping in this weekend, so I'll see what I can eke out.
