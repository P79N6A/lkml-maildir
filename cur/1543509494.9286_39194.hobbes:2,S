It's not really that difficult to code. It could be done with a simple
mount flag exactly like we do for 'nolock'.
The recipe is as follows:
  - Define another flag in nfs_mount.h (NFS_MOUNT_NOPAD) which is
    passed via the nfs_mount_data into the server->flags.
  - Define some simple way of passing it through 'struct
    nfs_writeargs', from nfs_proc_write() and create_write_request()
    to nfs_xdr_writeargs().
  - replace the #ifdef in nfs_xdr_writeargs().
You'll then have to convince Andries to accept another mount flag in
the nfs_mount.c parser, and finally convince Linus to accept a patch
for a bug that isn't in our kernel.
Guess which is the difficult bit ;-)...
Cheers,
  Trond
