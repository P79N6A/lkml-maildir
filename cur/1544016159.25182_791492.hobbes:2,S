I was concerning more about lilo side, is it use this param.
So here is a link
	
http://lists.linuxcoding.com/kernel/2006-q3/msg18665.html
is seems LILO has it's own definition for COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.
On the other hand it touches boot protocol. Peter should know
if it safe to hide/change COMMAND_LINE_SIZE. Peter?
