... except that any kernel < 2.6 didn't account tasks waiting for disk
IO. Load average has always been somewhat related to tasks contending
for CPU power. It's easy to say "shrug, it changed, live with it", but
at least give applications that want to be nice to the system a way to
figure out the real cpu load.
