Maybe -- but still, that's quite a steep requirement, and would also
require a fairly major redesign of the current kbuild architecture. 
I'm inclined to stick with per-directory builds for now, which is both
relatively simple to implement and where the _majority_ of the benefit
it likely to be seen.
Whole-kernel optimisation is something I'm inclined to leave until LTO
happens -- but don't let me stop you from investigating it.

Not that I'm aware of. There's overhead in the resulting ELF files, but
we combine sections in the vmlinux.lds so there isn't even that overhead
in the vmlinux.
