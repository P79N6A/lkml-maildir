Your make moveold script didn't take into account that the modutils from 
RedHat and Keith Owens have lsmod, modprobe, and rmmod as symlinks to 
insmod.  I worked around that by doing a "cp insmod lsmod", etc.
I took a stock 2.5.50-bk and added the namei.c patch and the patch to 
module.h out of the NEWS file.  The RedHat 8.0 bootup scripts did not 
autoload the pcmcia_core, yenta_socket, ds, orinoco_cs, orinoco, and 
hermes modules, but I could load them by hand.  Unfortuantely, it still 
does not allow the ethernet interface to be brought up an configured.
I then tried using the 2.4.18 kernel provided by RedHat.  I didn't get the 
error messages I got using your 0.8 module init tools, but it also 
wouldn't load the ethernet drivers for my SMC2632W PCMCIA card.
When I run stock RedHat I get <beep> <beep> when the card is inserted.  Is 
it true that the first beep is when the card insertion event is handled by 
the system, and the second beep is when the ethernet interface is brought 
up an configured?
In any case, on boot up I get <beep> <boop>.  I believe this means that 
the card insertion event was handled correctly, but that the ethernet 
interface was not brought up and configured.  lsmod does show that 
pcmcia_core, yenta_socket, and ds modules were loaded, but hermes, 
orinoco, and orinoco_cs were not.  The modules could be loaded by hand, 
but that still didn't allow the ethernet interface to be brought up and 
configured.  Following is a console extract from that session (The dhcp 
command at the end is a bash script which runs dhclient with the 
parameters required for me to connect):
