PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 12)
Just to add a bit more information, I've just build up a GA-965P-DS3  
with a Q6600 and the onboard Marvell doesn't seem to be working  
either with 2.6.21.3, 2.6.23-rc3 or a recent gentoo-sources kernel.
$ grep Marvell lspci
03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Unknown  
device 4364 (rev 12)
I've attached the lspci -vvv. I haven't had a chance to do much  
investigation since I just threw an 10/100 in for the time being. Let  
me know if I can provide any assistance in diagnosing or testing.
