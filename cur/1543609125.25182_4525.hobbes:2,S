What is a good way to test SYN cookies?  I can induce a three-second
delay (on victim host V) before new TCP connections are accepted by
sending a burst of 2000 SYN packets (from attacker A), where V is
running a 2.2.14 or 2.2.17 kernel.  During the three seconds ICMP echo
requests from A to V are being answered.
Turning on SYN cookies after /proc is mounted does not affect the
three-second pause, though, so I figure that either the pause is not
on account of a full half-open connection queue or SYN cookies are not
working.
