We should not be accepting of this situation, surely. I mean, the firewalls
have to get fixed. Multiple things are breaking here, due to this. What
are the other options they are messing with, and and any idea why?

If the firewall is actually stripping the TCP window scaling option,
then that tells the other end that we can't *receive* scaled windows
either, since the option indicates both, we are sending and capable
of receiving. i.e. The other end will not send us scaled windows.
There is no way we can fix this on the rcv end.

Does this need to be the default behaviour? Just how prevalent is
this??
