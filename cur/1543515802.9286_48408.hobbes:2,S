Good question! :)
My answer was just based on the following serial.c code fragment:
        if (info->tty->termios->c_cflag & CBAUD)
                info->MCR = UART_MCR_DTR | UART_MCR_RTS;
So, if no baud rate is set, the two signals do not go high. As this
function (startup) is only called when the port is first opened, that
means that the signals won't change.
Now, how to open the port with baud rate 0 (zero) is a good question. Ted?

Ivan
