NAK. This is an ABI change and one that was rejected before when this was
last discussed in detail. Moving it out of BKL makes a ton of sense, even
adding a "don't check" flag makes a lot of sense. Removing the checking
does not.
I'd much rather see
	if (flags & FL_NODLCHECK)
		posix_deadlock_detect(....)
The failure case for removing this feature is obscure and hard to debug
application hangs for the afflicted programs - not nice for users at all.
