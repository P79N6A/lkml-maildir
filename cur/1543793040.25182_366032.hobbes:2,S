I was wrong again. There is only one failure mode, with apparent huge 
traffic, but that traffic doesn't appear immediately after the keyboard 
bug. One more note: if a key is pressed when the bug manifests itself, 
it autorepeats in X indefinitely.
An archive that contains both the tcpdump and pppdump of the bug is 
available at:
http://ums.usu.ru/~patrakov/bad-dump.tar.bz2
Taken with commands:
pppd call motiv record ppp0.pppdump nodetach
tcpdump -i ppp0 -s 0 -w ppp0.tcpdump
Then irrelevant tails that consist of repeating packets were cut off by 
hand.
