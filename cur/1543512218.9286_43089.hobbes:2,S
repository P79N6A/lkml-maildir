there are quota files for users and groups that reside on disk.  when you init quota,
these files are read into the in core map.  from that point on until shutdown, the in
core map is used to maintain state.  at shutdown, any changes not already flushed to
these files are then done.
no daemon need be running to keep the kernel and userland in sync.  utilities can
make changes to the in core map which may also update the on disk file at the same
time.
