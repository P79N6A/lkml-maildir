Sure is :)

Going to try that tomorrow (or tonight if the coffee-gods deny me
sleep 8-) )...
Hmmm... what would be the proper part of the kernel to detect buggy ISA
chipsets? isa-quirks.c or something? Certainly not pci.c ...
Just bugged VIA tech support again... anyone care to bet on the odds of me
ever receiving a reply?
But if there is a DMA hang bug... *any* ISA device using DMA might hang,
right? Even SCSI cards and such?
