Yes the kernels prior to 2.6.24-rc1 did not have this bug.
The oops always appear when i plug in or remove the battery.

The bug went away on my Dell Latitude C610. I applied the patch on two boxes 
(2.6.24-rc1-git12) and the haldaemon is not killed and no oops when i remove 
the battery or plug it in. 
But on the Portege 3110CT the bug remains.
