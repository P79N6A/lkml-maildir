Subject: 2.6.0-test11 brings out gettimeofday() non-monotonicity

Hi,
I (and several others) have had some problems on dual AMD platform with
time going backwards.
The 2.6.0-test11 -kernel seems to bring it forth very well. I can
trigger this behaviour _almost_ every time, simply by running 'updatedb'.
Result is that 'gettimeofday()' starts jumping backwards.
I used a program (from earlier gettimeofday() monotonicity discusion),
attached below.

$ ./gtod-test | gawk '{ print $5; }' > avtime 
# about 30sec here, then ^C
$ sort avtime | uniq -c

On the other hand I recently heard from a developer that monotonic_clock
gave in some cases values of about 0xffffffff00000756, which to me looks
like a botched 64bit math. This was happening on UP, AMD board.
I've looked at the i386/kernel/time.co/do_gettimeofday(), but don't find
any fault with it.
