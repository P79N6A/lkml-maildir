thanks. I feel a little bit better :)

Yeah - I believe some people did test the DVB -stable patches, but obviously 
without the budget-av driver compile option enabled, so it didn't compile 
that code. DVB supports quite a few cards, so its easy to accidentally leave 
off one of the options when doing a mass compile of all drivers.
The only thing I can think of would be to require -stable patch submitters to 
supply a list of CONFIG options that must be on to enable compilation of the 
new code so people know exactly how to enable it for testing... but obviously 
since those would be manually specified, they can be wrong too. But at least 
it would show they'd thought about it a bit....
