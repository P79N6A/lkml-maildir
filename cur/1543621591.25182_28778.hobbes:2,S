So is the prototype config file, what's your point? You need BOTH the
actual config file and the actual kernel source including patches to
really know what happened and to replicate it. As in kernel.org source,
Redhat source, etc. There is no "the source."

That's the point, you probably only do the very simple stuff, booting from
a multi-GB disk. People who have more complex boot systems want the boot
image small, that's why it was gzipped and later bzipped, so it would fot
more places.
