this has to be one of the most bizarre arguments i've read in this 
thread as of date. Are you seriously questioning the notion that it's a 
good and legitimate idea for a hardware vendor to make the system 
fixable, patchable and upgradable? Are you seriously suggesting that for 
a hardware vendor to be able to offer such a solution, if they are under 
the unescapable restriction of content providers that the system itself 
must be tamper-proof, it should not be able to use a GPL-ed kernel at 
all? Because that is what your arguments lead to, and that is what the 
GPLv3 implements. In case you didnt notice: RMS _does not want the Tivo 
to use a GPLv3 kernel_, simple as that, and the GPLv3 achieves that. He 
wants Tivo to either to go out of business or to go to WinCE or some 
other OS. Did you ever think about the meaning of the "anti" word in the 
"anti-Tivo" expression? Hint: it's not some friendly suggestion of 
cooperation and working together ;)
