Subject: [PATCH 0/10] Convert gameport to driver model/sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
This series of patches adds a new "gameport" bus to the driver model.
It is implemented very similarly to "serio" bus and also allows
individual drivers to be manually bound/disconnected from a port
by manipulating port's "drvctl" attribute.
01-gameport-renames1.patch
- rename gameport->driver to gameport->port_data in preparation
  to sysfs integration to avoid confusion with real drivers.
02-gameport-renames2.patch
- more renames in gameport in preparations to sysfs integration,
  gameport_dev renamed to gameport_driver, gameport_[un]register_device
  renamed to gameport_[un]register_driver
03-gameport-connect-mandatory.patch
- make connect and disconnect mandatory as these call gameport_open
  and gameport_close which actually bind driver and port together.
04-gameport-dynalloc-prepare.patch
- sysfs/kobjects requires objects be allocated synamically. Prepare
  to dynamic gameport allocation, create gameport_allocate_port and
  gameport_free_port; dynamically allocated ports are freed by core
  upon release. Also add gameport_set_name and gameport_set_phys
  to ease transition.
05-gameport-dynalloc-input.patch
- convert drivers in input/gameport to dynamic gameport allocation.
06-gameport-dynalloc-sound-oss.patch
- convert drivers in sound/oss to dynamic gameport allocation.
07-gameport-dynalloc-sound-alsa.patch
- convert drivers in sound/pci to dynamic gameport allocation.
08-gameport-drivers-sysfs.patch
- add "gameport" bus and have joystick gameport drivers register
  themselves on this bus.
09-gameport-devices-sysfs.patch
- complete gameport sysfs integration. Gameports are registered on
  the "gameport" bus.
10-gameport-drvdata.patch
- Get rid of gameport->private, use driver-specific data in device
  structure, access through gameport_get/set_drvdata helpers.
The changes can also be pulled from my tree (which has Vojtech's
input tree as a parent):
	bk pull bk://dtor.bkbits.net/input 
I am CC-ing ALSA list as the changes touch quite a few sound drivers.
Comments/testing is appreciated.
