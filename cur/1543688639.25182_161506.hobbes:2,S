Cool.  Can you point me towards any background-reading on MCE?  This's got me 
interested.
Rather ironically, since I changed my kernel back to starting from 0, I 
haven't seen any errors.  Having said that, I was only getting a couple each 
day anyway, so I'll leave it a few days and see what develops.  I think it's 
happening only once on boot, every now and again, but I've not had time to 
analyse the logs properly yet.  Maybe there's a problem when my machine's 
cold...

Thanks for responding; it was fairly clear to me that I was out of my depth, 
and it's nice to know that there's someone out there that isn't *grin*
Cheers,
Matt
