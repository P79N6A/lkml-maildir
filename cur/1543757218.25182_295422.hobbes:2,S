This looks very similar (at least to me) to an OOPS I posted with 2.6.9
on 12/03/2004.

My system is also a dual Xeon using SMP and Hyperthreading
(/proc/cpuinfo shows 4 cpus).
Mine, like Ralf's, is also a mail server running postfix using ext3 for
the spool directory.

I've actually hit this bug (assuming it's the same) with 2.6.10 also.  I
had to power cycle remotely and unfortunately didn't have the serial
console logging enabled when it happened with 2.6.10.  I upgraded from
2.4.23 to 2.6.8.1 and crashed within a week, and continued to crash at
least monthly after that.  It had been running 2.4.23 for 200+ days with
no problems.
Hope this helps trace it back.
