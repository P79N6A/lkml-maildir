Perhaps this is good idea? It should be documented
somewhere... Please apply,

+Some notes about kgdb over ethernet
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ 2004 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
+
+Pass this on kernel commandline:
+
+	kgdbeth=interfacenum,localmac,listenport,remoteip,remotemac gdb
+
+Boot local machine. At the point where you enable eth0, machine will
+hang, waiting for remote gdb to connect. At that point, type this on
+remote machine:
+
+   $ gdb ./vmlinux
+   (gdb) target remote udp:HOSTNAME:6443
