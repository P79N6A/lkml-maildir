	All Linux apps currently overlook SIGDANGER.  I don't think
you mean to imply that all apps are buggy, bloated, memory hogs.
	Adding the above type of handling would seem to require source
changes to every app that wants take other than default memory handling.
	I'd like to see a way to minimally impact 1st, source, 2nd, Binary
compatibility.  If we are out of non-RT signals, the 2nd may be unavoidable.
	Perhaps the default with a SIGNMEM would be to ignore for
legacy apps, so they would just 'hang' on a malloc waiting for memory.
I dunno how many legacy apps are not written properly to handle an
error condition back from malloc, But if that's thought to be a 
problem default could be set to ignore.  Perhaps if the action if
SIGNMEM was 'received' (but not caught) would be to return a failure
from the operation that caused the SIGNMEM.  The default behavior
could be set, perhaps, via a /proc interface?  
	Ya know -- just as a point of amusement, WIN-CE has a 'SIGDANGER'
type functionality -- when memory is low, it calls a 'low memory' handler
in each app so they can release all the data they can, with, I believe,
the default on no handler to be to do nothing.  :-)  Now if they could
just get the random killing part down instead of suspending all
processes and asking the user what processes to kill, they'd have
pretty close to AIX functionality.
