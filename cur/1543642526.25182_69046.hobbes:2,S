No wonder it ran for 2 years. Are you using this machine frequently at
all? :)

This is exactly the mistake I've been meaning to warn you of.
The disk will corrupt sooner or later again and you'll have to go
through all the torture (possible backup/restore, missing data) again
and if you're unlucky (which is quite possible with your frequency of
use) the warranty is void until the problems appear the next time.
