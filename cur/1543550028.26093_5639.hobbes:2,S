C++ gives an overhead only if you abuse it.  The C++ code in my drivers does
nothing that the equivalent C doesn't also do, except that it's easier to read.

Again, you don't need to use exception handling in order to use C++.  None of
my C++ drivers use exception handling, and they don't need to.

True, but all the driver programmers I know personally already know C++.
