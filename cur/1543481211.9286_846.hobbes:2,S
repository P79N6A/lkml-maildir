I have a new arca-vm-28. I don't have time to comment the changes right
now, but I would like if you could try it and feedback. This is not
intended to be good in low memory system, it _could_ work fine also with
low mem, but I don't know...
I can tell you that the bench that was running in 100 sec in pre1 and in
50 sec since I killed kswapd, now it runs in 20 sec. Iteractive
performances seems good. Let me know.
Forget to tell, if it will be crazy or it will not compile, I could have
done mistakes in diffing the stuff (it's becoming a relevant work ;), in
such case you can download arca-109 that has arca-vm-28 included as well.
