The current code to do detect MDA fails for some cards. I tried it on my
Matrox Millenium card and it detected it as a mda card. At the time I was
also running vgacon and I was testing to see what would happen if mdacon
was called with no MDA card. I was hoping it would fail.  
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
