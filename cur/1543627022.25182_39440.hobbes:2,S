You don't say what kind of disk controllers but 2.4.18 was broken with
respect to error handling and Promise IDE controllers. I have one flakey disk
that would reboot a new machine after a few minutes activity. 2.4.19pre6 just
prints an error message, retrys and gos merrily on it way.
So if you have Promise chips maybe try switching boot drives?
