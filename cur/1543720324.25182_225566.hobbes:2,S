Trond also clearly spoke against it and Anton didn't seem to be impressed
by the code quality of your patches either ;-)  Only lmb who certainly
has a vested interest by beeing responsible for cluster at one of the above
mentioned vendors has speaken for it.  Given that SLES9 will already have
lustre life should already be much simpler for you.  If clusterfs is
actually interested in maintaining lustre as part of the linux kernel I'm
the last one to object, but without you place the burden of maintaining
all the hooks that are very specific to your filesystem on us.
p.s. where's lustre's current cvs tree?  I'd like to actually build a module
vs the hooks that you posted and growel in the cvs history a little.
