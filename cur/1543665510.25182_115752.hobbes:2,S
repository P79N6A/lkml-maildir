No. It may be measurable, but I've seen posts from very competent people
indicating that penalties of 2-5% are usual. Swapping to disk is going to
hurt a lot more than that, so if a system has lots of processes more
memory is usually better.
Maybe some of the benchmark gurus can point you to numbers on this.
