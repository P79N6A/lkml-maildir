I probably don't agree, but I think there might be a better way to deal
with this line of code - remove the entire routine ;).
I have a patch set I am about to send in to lkml for comment, that
removes the entire mechanism connecting cpusets to sched domains,
replacing it with a much simpler (even I can understand) mechanism to
update the isolated_cpu_map on the fly.
If that flies, then this present patch becomes obsolete and irrelevant.
