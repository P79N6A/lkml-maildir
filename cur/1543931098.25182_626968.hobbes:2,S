If we can roll the whole thing together, that would be nice.  However,
the way you're doing it with this patch, we now have an asymmetrical
interface:  The request routine must explicitly start the tag, but now
doesn't have to end it.
We really need symmetry.  Either go back to start tag/end tag, or absorb
the whole lot into the block infrastructure.
The original reason for the explicit start/end is that there are some
requests on a tagged device that aren't able to be tagged by the block
layer (some devices reserve tag numbers for specific meanings).
However, I don't think there's any driver that actually implemented this
feature.
