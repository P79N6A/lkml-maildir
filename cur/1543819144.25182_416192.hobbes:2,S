Something very bad has allegedly been happening in -mm.  It would have been
nice to have heard about this problem in that multi-month wwindow there. 
Does no human look at these numbers?

The 2.6.15-git5 -> 2.6.15-git6 diff is enormous.  I'd assume some bad thing
got transferred into mainline then.
How does one reproduce this?  Which type of filesystem, which command
line/config file?
Thanks.
