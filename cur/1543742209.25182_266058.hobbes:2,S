Alan already pointed out the inaccuracies in my statement.
The point is that the distribution is so sharply peaked on such a tiny
subset of the kernel, it's rather predictable what proportion of users
will be affected by a given bug according to what it's in. So, you can
in principle rank the areas of the kernel in need of verification by
this probability distribution, and carry out audits etc. that way. Even
your "variety" of drivers and architectures adds up to a truly tiny
fraction of the kernel. Worse yet, I was already counting the whole of
drivers/ide/, arch/i386/, and include/asm-i386/ in my accounting, so
you're actually describing a narrower subset of the kernel than I was.

These arguments are all proportions, but there's actually a rather large
chance that increasing the number of users would all happen by means of
more widely distributing some already-extremely-common hardware. That is,
there would be almost no additional users of the marginalized systems
(even in absolute terms), and the distribution across drivers etc.
would become even more sharply peaked on the same code than it is now.
