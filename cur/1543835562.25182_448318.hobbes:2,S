If the function is exported by md then md.h would be an appropriate place
for the declaration.

If we went that way then patch #1 would be "add a notifier" and patch #2
would be "use it in md".
Do we anticipate that there would ever be other users of this notifier
callback API?

I guess it sounds logical, but I'm not sure what the end result would look
like.  Which amounts to noncommittal Sunday afternoon waffling ;)
The notifier certainly makes sense if we anticipate other users of it.  If
we think it'll always be an md-special thing then yeah, I guess we can code
it that way.
