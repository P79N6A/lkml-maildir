Part of the problem here is that ACPI already has its own terminology, 
and you're trying to invent a new one instead of using the existing 
one.
I agree, it would be good to have a non-ACPI-specific hibernation mode,
something which would look to ACPI like a normal shutdown.  But I'm not 
so sure this is possible.
You have to understand that the ACPI spec is weird and complex.  The
mere fact that you have written a system image to disk changes the way
ACPI regards the shutdown procedure.  Even though you may treat all the
devices and the rest of the hardware exactly the same, it's a different
operation as far as ACPI is concerned, with different requirements.
Yes, it's bizarre.  Why do you think so many people have complained so 
vehemently about ACPI for all these years?
