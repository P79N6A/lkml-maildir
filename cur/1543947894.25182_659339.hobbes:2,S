More precisely, reads and writes of pointers are always atomic.  That 
is, if a write and a read occur concurrently, it is guaranteed that the 
read will obtain either the old or the new value of the pointer, never 
a mish-mash of the two.  If this were not so then RCU wouldn't work.

Forget it, I'm going to withdraw the entire thing.  The whole approach 
is wrong.  More details in a new email thread, to follow soon.
