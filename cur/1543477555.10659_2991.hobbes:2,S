Not exactly. Real point is that in C++ you have non-optimal realization of
objects (it should be non-optimal since for different tasks optimal solution
is different :-) while in C you could make realization of YOUR (not compiler!)
choice ! Sometimes it's important, sometimes not so important. IMO kernel is
place where such flexibily is REALLY important...

INEVITABLE ? Are you joking ? Just add pointer to vtable and use one additional
memory reference (just like C++ :-). Here is the point: in C you have CHOICE
unlike C++ ! If you need fast call and not need fast copy or initialization
(like filesystem objects: there are exactly one object for each loaded
filesystem and thus speed of initialization is not matter even if there are
a lot of virtual functions; and copy is not allowed at all) you could have it.
If you need fast copy and not need fast call you could have this as well !
This is not so big deal for application programming but for kernel this is
real win...
