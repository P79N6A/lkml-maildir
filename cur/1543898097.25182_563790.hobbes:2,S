The GPL forces nobody to not release his module under PD, therefore it can't
protect you from that. Even minor changes - like adjusting the module to use
to the current API - won't change that, at least in Germany they'd have to
qualify as a work of their own in order to create a GPL-only derived work,
because anything not qualifying for that could also be integrated into the
PD version, and both would remain identical.
