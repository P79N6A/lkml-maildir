That's a bit ugly, isn't it?  We don't want to modify the pte permissions
in this case.  We just want the page frame.  But we do still want to call
handle_mm_fault() if the page isn't there at all, or to COW it.
One way to handle that would be to give the `write' arg to
handle_mm_fault() a third value which means "give us a writeable page, but
don't make the pte writeable".  Maybe that isn't warranted for this special
case.  But it would be better, really.

This guy forgot to flush the tlb after modifying the pte permissions, and
symbol `entry' is not defined.  We've hit the latter problem multiple
times.  It's a good argument for empty inlines rather than empty macros.
