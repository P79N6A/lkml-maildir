But isn't a '/' character a valid character for a file or directory
name?  :) 
Yeah, it's pathalogical, but why burden the core from something that is
instantly obvious to the developer as a "wrong" thing to do?
It's much easier to see, "Oh, my driver created a stupid directory name
because of the string I told it to use", than "why in the world is the
driver core rejecting my register call when I _know_ it's a correct
structure".
