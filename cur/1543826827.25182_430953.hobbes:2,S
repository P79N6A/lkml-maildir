Solve the naming conflict when compiling. Seemed to me like it is impossible to create a
twofish.o out of twofish.o and twofish_common.o . And since having the original module name
seemed more important to me i changed the name. I didn't find any other way in documentation
of the kernel makefiles. I hope this isn't another newbie mistake. =)
