Well someone said the VIA uses INTA for the DN19 on their riser card,
although is that INTA from the CPUs point of view or INTA from the slot
the riser card is plugged into?  There was also mention of a BIOS update
needed on some boards to even support the riser card at all.  Maybe that
applies.

Which bridge?  Interrupts on the mainboard can do anything they want
(and do).

This would be true, if the bios assigned interrupts to devices that way
all the time, but this is bus 0 and there are no rules.  After all if
slot 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 all used INTA->INTA then that would make
sense, but slot 20 (0x14) is using INTB->INTA so that isn't the case.
And why would slot 18 (0x12) and slot 19 (0x13) both use INTA?  If the
bios doesn't expect a device in slot 19 then it won't assing an irq
correctly, and it will only be correct if the bios knows how it was
wired.

Are there any bios options for enabling support for slot 19 devices on
riser cards?
