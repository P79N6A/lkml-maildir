I am trying to write a file system for 2.6.  I have written the
required things to mount my file system and now i am trying to get
some f_op's and d_op's. I was trying to make the 'ls' command work. So
i wrote a myfs_readdir() and linked it to the f_op field. My routine
gets called and also filldir gets called and stores the data in the
dirent but i dont get the output in stdout.
  On using strace i find that "ls" does not perform all the calls that
a "ls" in a directory mountedf in ext2 performs. To be specific, the
strace ouput ends after the getdents64 system call. In the normal "ls"
strace, i find there are a couple of more system calls namely a fstat
followed by a write to stdout and some more mmap calls.
  I dont understand the reason behind why the write is not called. My
guess is i have not over-ridden some function that i have to write as
part of my file system instead of using the default method.
  Any help regarding this would be appreciated...
  regards
