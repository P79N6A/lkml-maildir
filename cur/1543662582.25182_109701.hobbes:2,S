Happy St. Valentine's Day!
We are glad to announce the [1]USAGI STABLE RELEASE 4.1, dated on the
February 14th, 2003. This is the maintenance release of the STABLE
RELEASE 4 dated on October 7th, 2002. People who use previous releases
are encouraged to upgrade to this release.
Changes from the STABLE RELEASE 4 are:
  * based on latest kernel linux-2.4.20.
  * glibc-2.3.x friendly.
  * IPsec tunnel mode support and DH Group 1 support in Pluto.
  * fixed (possible) panic in rawv6_recvmsg().
  * fixed memory leakages in getifaddrs() and if_nameindex().
  * fixed NI message format of ping6.
and so on.
You can get our complete kit which includes kernel tree, library and
applications from <

We also provide separate patches against the main-line kernel and the
tools <
ftp://ftp.linux-ipv6.org/pub/usagi/stable/split/>.
We have a plan to provide the binary packages for some distributions.
They will appear under

Some of our efforts are already in mainline kernel tree. We continue
working spliting our changes into reasonable size and trying merging
it into mainline kernel tree.
