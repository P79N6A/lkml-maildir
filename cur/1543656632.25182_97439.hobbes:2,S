I've just noticed, the help text for this driver says:
> This driver can support up to four CD-ROM controller cards, and each
> card can support up to four CD-ROM drives; if you say Y here, you
> will be asked how many controller cards you have.
but it doesn't seem to prompt for the second and subsequent interfaces
like 2.4 does.
I know, there are probably not many people using five or more of the
corresponding CD-ROM drives on a 2.5 machine, (I don't even own one of
the drives), but I thought I'd point it out.
John.
