I'm very encouraged to read of your expanded testing efforts. As a bcm43xx developer, Ubuntu has
been our problem distro, mostly because your standard kernels have debugging turned off for bcm43xx.
When a Ubuntu user reports a problem and we ask for the relevant output from dmesg, they have no
information. I ask two things of all distros: (1) Turn on debugging - we don't spam the logs that
badly, and (2) forward any bugs found by your testing to the maintainer, and/or the bcm43xx mailing
list.
Thanks,
Larry
