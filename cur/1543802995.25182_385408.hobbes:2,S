[cleaned up some Cc as this is not interesting to all MLs]
Andrew,
first bisection spotted the cause of the stalls at boot (happening while
starting portmap and after usb-storage scan):
time-clocksource-infrastructure.patch
time-generic-timekeeping-infrastructure.patch
time-i386-conversion-part-1-move-timer_pitc-to-i8253c.patch
time-i386-conversion-part-2-rework-tsc-support.patch
time-i386-conversion-part-3-enable-generic-timekeeping.patch
time-i386-conversion-part-4-remove-old-timer_opts-code.patch
time-i386-conversion-part-5-acpi-pm-variable-renaming-and-config-change.patch
time-i386-clocksource-drivers.patch
time-fix-cpu-frequency-detection.patch
Cc-ed john stultz
actually git bisect[1] pointed to time-fix-cpu-frequency-detection.patch
but it's clearly wrong. Reverting all the above patches (I suppose they
are somewhat related) fixes the stalls I experience. I can test
corrections if necessary.
eh, see: during the multiple boots I noticed that just hitting sysrq
make the boot process go on when stuck

I'll re-bisect the thing tomorrow to spot what's causing reiserfs oops
[1]: I imported the patches into git by means of:
while [ $(quilt next) ] ; do 
	quilt push && git add && git commit -a -m "$(quilt top)" ; 
done
