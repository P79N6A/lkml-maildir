Trond can probably answer this better than me...
As I read it, currently the nfs client matches both the fileid and the
filehandle (in nfs_find_actor). This means that different filehandles
for the same file would result in different inodes :(.
Strictly following the nfs protocol, comparing only the fileid should
be enough IF fileids are indeed unique within the filesystem.
Comparing the filehandle works as a workaround when the exported filesystem
(or the nfs server) violates that.  From a user stand point I think that
this should be configurable, probably per mount point.
