Just as a quick update -- I seem to only be able to reproduce this
crash when my ppp session drops, which seems associated with marginal
signal.  And unfortunately I have great coverage at home so I haven't
been able to reproduce this again today.  Maybe on the train tomorrow
I can crash my laptop...
