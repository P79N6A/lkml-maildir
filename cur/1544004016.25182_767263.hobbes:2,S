That's a regression in current gcc, surely?
static void serial_unlink_irq_chain(struct uart_8250_port *up)
{
	struct irq_info *i;
	struct hlist_node *n;
	struct hlist_head *h;
	mutex_lock(&hash_mutex);
	h = &irq_lists[up->port.irq % NR_IRQ_HASH];
	hlist_for_each(n, h) {
		i = hlist_entry(n, struct irq_info, node);
		if (i->irq == up->port.irq)
			break;
	}
	BUG_ON(n == NULL);
	BUG_ON(i->head == NULL);
#define hlist_for_each(pos, head) \
	for (pos = (head)->first; pos && ({ prefetch(pos->next); 1; }); \
	     pos = pos->next)
hlist_for_each() can execute that loop zero times, in which case
serial_unlink_irq_chain will dereference an uninitialised variable.
Presumably the list shouldn't be empty at this stage, but this
is not particularly robust behaviour if that should happen..
