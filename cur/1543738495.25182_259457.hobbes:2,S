A couple questions:
- Is it possible to boot with an empty /dev, until udev builds it ?
No, it isn't as far as I know.
- If this is not the case, which are the minimal nodes that should be
  present ?
/dev/null and /dev/console is needed to boot into the envoirment
- For any answer to previous question, shouldn't the distro set up minimal
  /dev (empty or with a few nodes) and _delete_ the old /dev tree ?
At least I could do so, but at the moment /dev are also elemental for some distros..I have moved with gentoo and have had no problems along x86 32bit
but x86_64 driving me creazy
I you want more to know have a look at decibiles udev primer
