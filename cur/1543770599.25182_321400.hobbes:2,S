I traced a puzzling bug down to the combination of SS_CAP_STATIC_MAP,
finicky hardware, and a bug fixed by the following patch.  The fix
is a one-liner that won't affect any socket driver that's yet merged;
basically, it stops discarding I/O attributes for static mappings.
- Dave
The PCMCIA card services layer is never setting the i/o map attributes
when SS_CAP_STATIC_MAP is specified.  Net result, sockets' set_io_map()
calls always see requests with most flags clear, meaning 8 bit access.
For hardware that always autosizes, that won't matter; and all current
STATIC_MAP drivers ignore those attributes.  A new driver (for at91rm9200)
suffers badly from this, since this forces everything into 8 bit mode and
that breaks both (a) cards requiring 16 bit access, and (b) ide-cs; but
of course 8-bit cards work OK (as does accessing card attributes).
So this patch arranges to pass the attributes down, matching the behavior
for non-static mappings (using the first/only I/O window).
