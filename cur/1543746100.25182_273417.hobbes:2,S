Once again:
  _this will break at link time if two such modules are included 
   statically into the kernel_
obj-$(CONFIG_W1_DS9490)         += ds9490r.o 
ds9490r-objs    := dscore.o
obj-$(CONFIG_W1_FOO)         += foo.o 
foo-objs    := dscore.o
This will break with CONFIG_W1_DS9490=y and CONFIG_W1_FOO=y.
That drivers/w1/ contains many EXPORT_SYMBOL's with no in-kernel users 
is a different issue I might send a separate patch for (that besides 
proprietary modules there might come some day open source drivers using 
them is not a reason).
