For some things. I do it a bit because you can use it to fake
failures that are tricky to do in the real world. It won't tell you the
driver works but its suprisingly good for testing for races (forcing IRQ
delivery at specific points), buggy hardware you don't posess, and things
like media failures and timeouts your real hardware refuses to do.
