	How do you generate a one-time-pad? a one time pad must be by definition 
truly random, and be used only once. and if you can send the Securikey 
via a secure channel at the same time as the message, then you don't need 
the OTP.
	I should also mention that the problem with 'generating' an OTP via any 
mechanical or algorithmic means is impossible as at best an OTP will only 
be pseudo-random, and therefore with identical inputs (assuming it is 
possible, which we can assume here for the sake of theory and security), 
the same OTP can be generated, thus breaking our assumption/necessity of 
non-deterministic output.
	I'd say more but I'm on my way to work.
