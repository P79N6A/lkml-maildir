Hi all.
Hope everyone had a great Christmas (or holiday in general if you don't
celebrate Christmas).
I've got a couple of questions about scsi devices and scsi equivalents of
ioctl() calls.
The HDIO_GET_IDENTITY ioctl() call is very useful for IDE devices, and 
it has a couple of manpages.  But I cannot find a simple-enough scsi
equivalent.  I've looked at the linux/scsi* headers as well as the scsi
drivers in the kernel, even including the code that handles the /proc/scsi
tree.
I haven't found any simple documentation (manpage style =P) for scsi_ioctl.
Anyhow, all I am looking for is a scsi-equivalent to
ioctl(int d, HDIO_GET_IDENTITY, struct hd_driveid *hd)
Also, there are a couple of scsi-related ioctl() calls (most notably the
calls that enable and disable tagged command queneing), but none of the
good stuff, like a HDIO_GET_IDENTITY equivalent.  Why are such calls not
implemented in ioctl() for non-IDE devices?  It seems to me that perhaps
implementing a SCSI_GET_IDENTITY command in ioctl() would make things
easier.  But then again, I don't do kernel development.  =)
Thanks,
Mike
