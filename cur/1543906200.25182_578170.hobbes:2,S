That would only matter if you're interested in absolute system
performance of different systems.
But comparable performance testing in general only makes sense when you
only change one variable: either you change the hardware or
you change the software. If you change both at the same time
you'll never know where the difference comes from. 
I assume this facility is aimed at software performance testing:
this means it doesn't make much sense to compare numbers
between different systems; just relative numbers on the same
system with different software.
If you want absolute comparable system performance benchmarks I don't think
micro-instrumenting the kernel is a good approach.
But for relative performance cycles are fine. Anyways if you really
wanted to do ns it's possible too, but far more complicated to do correctly.
