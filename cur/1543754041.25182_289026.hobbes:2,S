I've been silently maintaining it offlist. No real development but 
keeping it in sync and fixing obvious bugs that show up that I can fix.
Here's a patch for 2.6.10-ck5 (should apply fairly cleanly to 2.6.10):
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.10/2.6.10-ck5/patches/supermount-ng208-10ck5.diff
and for 2.6.11-rc1
http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.11-rc1/patches/supermount-ng208-2611rc1.diff
