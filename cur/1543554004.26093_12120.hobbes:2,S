I think you should never do that. Those macros are outdated and were
removed from kernel. Patch NVdriver instead. Patch is attached.
BTW: does your board run ok on 2.4 ? I have a TNT2 and have not been able
to get it working on a 2.4-smp. In 2.2-smp works fine. I don't know what
is bad...In a recent strace (with test10), it seemed to be hanged on a
poll() call...
