It's a sad day when the author of COPYING gets dissed in a
public linux forum.
On a technical level, gcc is an essential tool for kernel hacking.
On a philosophical level, Mr. Stallman articulated seminal ideas
that have guided the development of a simply amazing quality and
quantity of software.
He deserves respect.
