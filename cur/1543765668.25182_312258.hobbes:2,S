TOEs can remove the data copy on receive. In some applications (notably
storage), where the application does not touch most of the data, this is
a significant advantage that cannot be achieved in a software-only
solution.

again, this depends on the application.
a copyless solution is probably necessary to achieve 10Gb/s speeds.
