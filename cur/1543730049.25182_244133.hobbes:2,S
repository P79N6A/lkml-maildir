In the config file I've changed template from linux to checktunnel. With 
kernel 2.6.7 it shows all the options it receives from the server. With 
2.6.8.1:
root@noname:~# tspc -f /etc/freenet6/tspc.conf -vvv
tspc - Tunnel Server Protocol Client
Loading configuration file
Connecting to server
[now waits until Ctrl-c]
