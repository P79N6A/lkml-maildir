Not so. Your first instance tested if the assignment succeeded. It
is a common error called 'boolean test of assignment' and is the
most common error I've seen in 'C' coding.
The next instance makes the assignment first, then makes a boolean
test. This is actually another error which Lint will pick up. However,
since a boolean type is commonly 'int', but not always, it is
probably acceptable.
#include <stdio.h>
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
int main()
{
 int i;
 if(i=foo())
     (void)puts("If this is not seen, it is a compiler BUG!");
 return 0;
}
This is the output from Lint which was configured to allow most
'gcc' anomolies to get through.
LCLint 2.2a --- 04 Sep 96
xxx.c: (in function main)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if is assignment expression: i = foo()
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use ==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (-predassign will suppress
  message)
xxx.c:13,5: Test expression for if not bool, type int: i = foo()
  Test expression type is not boolean or int. (-predboolint will suppress
  message)
Finished LCLint checking --- 2 code errors found
