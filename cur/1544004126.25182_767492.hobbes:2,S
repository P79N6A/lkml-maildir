Hi!
I'm wondering about the status of Xen support in the vanilla kernel.
I know that DomU support is inside the kernel an evolving, but I did
not find an up-to-date hint about the status of Dom0 support.
A while ago I read that it should be included in 2.6.28, but I do not
find any current pointer about the status of this.
Thanks for hacking on it!
