Accessing a kernel pointer from user-space isn't going to work.
But you can transfer data to/from user-space/kernel-space so
just don't use a pointer, do...
struct test struct {
      char name[BIG_ENOUGN];
      int size;
      ....
      };
Write your strings to the name[] buffer-member and everybody is happy.
