This is my understanding:
case 1:
   rm library.so; cp library.so.NEW library.so
   # You have just changed the inode. The library `file' is still
   # open and referenced, and thus will be deleted only when closed.
   # Presumably new programs will start using the new version
   # (it's probably best to use mv, unless cp doesn't need library.so)
case 2:
   cp library.so.NEW library.so
   # You overwrite data in the shared library. Bad.
I would have expected case 2 to return `Text file busy' as it does
on many UNIXen.
