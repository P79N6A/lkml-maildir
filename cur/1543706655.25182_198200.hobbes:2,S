APIC, ACPI, IOAPIC, enabled or disabled..  lots of different kernels
soltek frn2 nforce2 based board, barton XP 2500+, 512mb ddr
Bios doesn't allow disabling of stop grant, but I've tried both states
with athcool.
It's really entering the stop grant state, because when completely idle it
makes a measurable heat difference.  (though when playing mp3s, almost all
of the cooling benefit is lost)
This machine hasn't crashed yet.
If there's something I can do to crash it so I don't feel special
anymore,  or if there's some way I can provide useful information, let me
know.

I hope my email wasn't interpreted as an attack on the patch.  I think
getting linux running on flakey hardware without any support at all from
the manufacturer is incredibly cool.
