You've misunderstood my comment - it isn't that I think the hard disks
WILL be trashed, more that I'm not in a position to risk having them
trashed. Looked at from that perspective, "should be" just isn't good
enough...
Therefore, as stated in my comment quoted above, I'll wait until it's
finished and debugged...
Best wishes from Riley.
