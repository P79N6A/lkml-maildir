If you mean critical as in "the kernel panics on boot without this patch", 
then yes, this patch is not critical.
But if you think it's important to allow -stable to make full use of rootfs, 
then this patch offers a much needed fix, by simply replugging existing 
code.
Again, it's your call.
Thanks!
