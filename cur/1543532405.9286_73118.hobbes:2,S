Hi,
I've posted this message to comp.protocols.time.ntp newsgroup but
didn't get any response.
I thought may be you guys could help me since this bind thing concerns
the
kernel anyway.

I'll be glad if you could explain me what's the reason for that message,
since that address is not supposed to be in use.
Thanks a lot,
Art.
