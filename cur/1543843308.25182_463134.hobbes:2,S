That is good news. The current list of changes we are considering is
1) provide batched state transitions for state changes to unused on page
free, from unused to stable on page allocation and to volatile for
page/swap cache pages. Details are still under discussion but I think it
is doable.
2) Get rid of the PG_state_change page flags bit. Use a hashed lock on
the page index instead
3) Get rid of page_host_discards() by defining PageDiscarded() and
friends conditional on CONFIG_PAGE_STATES.
If you can think of anything else that would help wiht the VMware
implementation let me know.
