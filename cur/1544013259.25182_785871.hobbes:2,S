EMBEDDED leads to following options :
Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)
[*]   Enable 16-bit UID system calls (NEW)
[*]   Sysctl syscall support (NEW)
[*]   Load all symbols for debugging/ksymoops (NEW)
[*]     Include all symbols in kallsyms
[*]       Strip machine generated symbols from kallsyms
[*]     Do an extra kallsyms pass
[*]   Support for hot-pluggable devices (NEW)
[*]   Enable support for printk (NEW)
and these are perfect options for Embedded.
But selection of the PROCESSOR based on EMBEDDED is not a good logic.
CONFIG_PROCESSOR_SELECT should be an independent and by default should
select all related CPUs but user can specify its own CPU if he wants.
If I know what is my CPU there is no point for supporting all related
CPUs in my kernel.
This needs to be fixed.
