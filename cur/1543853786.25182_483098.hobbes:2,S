Hold on a minute.  These "problem machines" are completely compliant
with all the relevant ia64 specs in this area.  There is no spec that
says a keyboard controller must be present or that reading a non-
existent I/O port should be safe.
What about the FADT iapc_boot_arch bit?  Did you determine that isn't
sufficient for some reason?  That's available very early.
