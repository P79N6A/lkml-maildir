hi,
i'm looking for a solution to issue a DMA directly from a peripheral
interface card to user space, and i'm wondering if there are any ongoing
projects/implementations/plans to put that stuff into 2.3.X
possible (naive) solutions:
	o Robert Kaisers udma patch (or something similar)
	o adding a syscall which does something like kmalloc (..., GFP_DMA)
		... because it would be nice to have a concaternated
		physical memory to dma without the need to scatter/gather
	o something completely different (and more elegant ways ...)
thanks for any response
	++dent
