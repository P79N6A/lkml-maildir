Do you really think exposing low level internals as memory layout / zone
split up to userspace is a good idea ? (and worth it given that the VM
already has a cpu locality preference?)
I'd much rather see the VM have an arch-specified "cost" for getting
memory from not-the-prefered zones than exposing all this stuff to
userspace and depending on userspace to do the right thing.... it's the
kernel's task to abstract the low level details of the hardware after
all.
