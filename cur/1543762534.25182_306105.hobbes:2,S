Without the call_usermodehelper in kobject_hotplug, the first suspend
seems to work OK (which I think confirms the theory).  But after resume,
the second suspend hangs in the same place.  It's calling
call_usermodehelper from input_call_hotplug... time to comment out
another one and recompile.
I also tried -mm1 and it hangs in the same place.
