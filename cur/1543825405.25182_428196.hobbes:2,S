Hmmm... That's a good point.  It doesn't any more.  This patch is obsolete and
can be dropped.
It used to be used to set up a separate namespace in which to do NFSv4 path
traversal during mount so that we could walk from '/' to the nominated
directory on the NFS4 server using link_path_walk(), but the patches don't do
that now.
