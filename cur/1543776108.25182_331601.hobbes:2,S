Hey, sounds like the idea I proposed a couple months ago of storing the
path names in each file, instead of in directories.  Only better, since
each path component isn't text but a link instead.
It still has the performance and locking problem of having to update
every child file when moving a directory tree to a new parent.  On the
other hand, maybe the benefit is worth the cost.
