Yes, this problem is known. The have_submounts() patch that was
included in linux-2.2.14 in order to fix the same problem hasn't yet
been prepared for the 2.3.x series due to lack of time.
I'll see if I can't start work on merging stuff in to 2.3.x once I get
back from next week's Lake Louise conference. In particular, I've
already prepared a few new SunRPC updates that (assuming Alexey agrees
with them) should fix the outstanding problems with the xprt/socket
code.
Cheers,
  Trond
