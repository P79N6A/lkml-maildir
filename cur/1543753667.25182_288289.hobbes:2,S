I see different behaviours on different architectures.
	i386 - machine hang
	Power5 ppc64 - only the process hang
	Power3 ppc64 - machine hang
I modified it to use spin_lock() instead of spin_lock_irq()  -
things are the way I was expecting. Only process hang, not
the system. 
You may be right on other CPUs stuck on IPI.
Thanks,
Badari
