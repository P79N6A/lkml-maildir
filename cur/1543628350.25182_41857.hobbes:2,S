Depends on how small each piece ends up having to be with the lowest
common denominator approach. (Shouldn't end up with too small pieces)
Its easy to miss/forget that merging chains redundantly does have a 
bit of extra cost on the completion path - extra callback invokations 
(bi_end_io)to collate results.

Yes, the mempool alloc aspects get quite confusing even when thinking
about
the normal bio path ... (e.g bounce bio's are probably already an aspect
of
concern since we have multiple allocations by the same thread drawing
into the 
same pool, a generic condition that has earlier been cited as a source
of potential deadlock) With splitting it gets worse. (BTW, for similar
reasons. drawing from 
the common pool may not be the best thing to do when splitting ..,
though 
multiple pools probably come with their source of problems)
But then, the situation of writeout of the last page again is not a
common
case. In this case it makes sense to revert to the lowest common
denominator
... , but must we do so in every case ?
Again, it really depends on how small the lowest common denominator
turns
out to be. If one can have the entire layout information abstracted in
a way to be able to compute it in advance for a given block so it
doesn't
limit one to be too conservative fine ... but I don't know if that's
always feasible.
As such, its good to avoid splitting in general relying on good hints,
but
perhaps have room for the stray case that crops up -- either handle the
split,
or maybe have a way pass back an error to retry with smaller size.
Maybe 2 limits (one that indicates that anything bigger than this is
sure to
get split, so always break it up, and another that says that anything
smaller
than this is sure not to be split, so use this size when you can't
afford a
split).
