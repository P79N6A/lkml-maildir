if you run tcpdump, i'm betting you -will- see those responses appear on
your linux router.  those packets don't however make it out of the kernel
and onto your lan.  they hit the bit bucket.
i've reported this with regards to the GRE tunneling.  to be specific, i see
the GRE encapsulated packet arrive over ppp0, but it disappears instead of
making it out to eth0.
