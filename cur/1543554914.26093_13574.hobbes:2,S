Ignore this code.  It's bullshit -- you can't just go and poke random
boards -- even with IN's -- indiscriminately.  As usual, Richard is
writing long lectures on subjects he is seriously mistaken about (and
probably will send me yet another email trying to browbeat me into not
calling him on all his errors.)
The standard algorithm, documented in many places, is the one I gave
before:
	(port >= 0x1000 && (port & 0x0300) == 0)
Allocating ports in any other ranges is unsafe.
