I am interested in seeing the changes. I am right now working on getting parts of OpenSSI (www.openssi.org)
changes merged  upstream. Bruce Walker of the OpenSSI project have a design of implementing cluster wide procs. The
same doc can be found on www.openssi.org website. The paper talks about how to implement cluster wide proccess model
without requiring home/deputy concept. But yes it require some core kernel changes. But should be Conditionally enabled
like selinux. So overhead for non cluster users should be nill.
Regarding my work you can see the status here
http://git.openssi.org/~kvaneesh/gitweb.cgi?p=ci-to-linus.git;a=summary
It only gets the ICS changes. That means it introduce a transport independent kernel cluster framework. Right now it supports two interconnect IPV4 and infiniband verbs. 
I am planning on taking the CFS changes. That should bring in clusterwide shared memory too. The way it was done in OpenSSI
was to hook a new nopage() function for CFS so that when we page fault, we bring the pages from other node.So i am not sure whether
one need a VM hook for getting clusterwide shared memory. But without seeing the code i am clueless.
