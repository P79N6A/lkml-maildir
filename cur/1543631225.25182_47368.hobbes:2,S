Off the top of my head, it looks like ide_init_default_hwifs creates
an uninitialised "hw_regs_t hw;" variable, fills in some fields, then
calls "ide_register_hw(&hw, NULL);" which does "memcpy(&hwif->hw, hw,
sizeof(*hw));" thus copying the unitialised fields (such as "chipset")
right over the area zeroed by init_ide_data().
Am I on the right track?
