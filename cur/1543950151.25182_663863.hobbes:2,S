Unless it explicitly requests padding, it shouldn't be a problem
extra_len will always be zero and currently the only driver which uses
padding and draining is libata.

Maybe I'm from Mars but I don't really understand all this fuss.  The
two patches I posted way back work perfectly fine and don't have any of
these problems and as I have said again and again that's because it
doesn't break the assumption which our internal mechanics depend on.
Can you please put the "true" size aside for a while and consider those
patches?  There's nothing fundamentally wrong with letting the
rq->data_len be sum(sg) which can differ from user requested data length
if and only if low level driver requests so.
If you can come up with something nicer, that will be great too but I
really don't think the current scheme will work.
Thanks.
