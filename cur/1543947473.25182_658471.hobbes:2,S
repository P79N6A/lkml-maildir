How about this?

Align the members of the SSB device structure to a 32 bit boundary so
that the b43 driver can be built for arm using a cross compiler. This
change is required so that the test in scripts/mod/file2alias.c that
checks that the size of the device ID type against the size of the
section in the object file succeeds (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/18/481
 for discussion).
