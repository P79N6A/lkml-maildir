The PDC20276 is embedded on my Athlon motherboard and
supposedly offers ATA133 & (software) RAID.
I can offer testing support and whatever information I can
gather from the hardware itself and the accompanying windoze
drivers for anyone working on this.  
I tried 2.4.18pre3-ac2 (ie. with andre hedrick patches)
without success and grepping the source turns up references
to  the 2026x and 20270.
the lkml and ata-raid archives and google's groups doesn't
turn up anything.
please CC me in replies.
cheers,
kobus
