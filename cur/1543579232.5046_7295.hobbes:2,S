BTW, are you having any trouble with your ps/2 mouse port in X?  On my new
ASUS board, ps/2 mouse devices (just in X, gpm works fine) act a little
crazy (random mouse movement, random clicking, etc., except I'm not the
one doing all the random movement).  I'm not sure what it is, though I do
know it's not as bad once I upgraded from 2.2.18pre21 to 2.4.0.  I think
I'm going to try using the mouse as a usb device and see if I still have
trouble.  Anyway, just wondering if you're seeing the same problem.
