Ok, I'll try to narrow the barrier usage a bit, I'm waiting on the
barrier write once it is sent, so I'm not worried about anything done
after the ordered tag.
write X log blocks   (simple tag)
write 1 commit block (ordered tag)
wait on all of them.
All I care about is knowing that all of the log blocks hit the disk
before the commit.  So, if one of the log blocks aborts, I want it
to abort the commit too.  Is this a little easier to implement?

I do see that on my drives ;-)  The main reason I think its worth trying
is because the commit block is directly adjacent to the last log block,
so I'm hoping the drive can optimize the commit (even though it is ordered)
better when the OS sends it directly after the last log block.
While I've got linux-scsi cc'd, I'll reask a question from yesterday.
Do the targets with write back caches usually ignore the order tag, 
doing the write in the most efficient way possible instead?
