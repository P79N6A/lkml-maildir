I reproduced this with vanilla 2.6.12.2 now, and I'm quoting
the entire message for the benefit of the guys over at
linux-poweredge@dell.com
To make it short, the suspend/wakeup loop didn't occur with 2.6.12.2
vanilla.
Still the bug happens, the box is apparently usable, but not
for the remote administration, so usability is quite shaky
a definition ;)
The relevant stuff is still at the url below, the two new interesting
files are:
http://mjt.nysv.org/kernelbugfest/usb_bug_2.6.12.2.ksymoops
http://mjt.nysv.org/kernelbugfest/netconsole_panic_2.6.12.2
(The netconsole issue is probably not related and I'll look into it
later, if ever, as we're not really using it...)
I also got a hint that disabling power management might help,
but that has to wait until tomorrow.. Anyone want to back
this theory? :)
Thanks!
