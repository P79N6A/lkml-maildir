Maybe for consistency with other packages, the default "make install" should 
imply modules_install too.
I know you can hack around this with /sbin/installkernel (on at least x86 and 
x86_64), but it's counterintuitive. I guess the reason is that 'install' has 
always meant "just the bzImage please", and sometimes it's valid to install 
only a bzImage without reinstalling modules. However, it just leads to 
problems such at the original poster's.
