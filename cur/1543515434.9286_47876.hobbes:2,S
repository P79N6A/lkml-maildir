Hmm, strange, when I tell my motherboard to use MPS 1.4, I still get the
following message when booting 2.3.26:
Nov  9 12:17:06 spaans-smp kernel: found SMP MP-table at 01006384
Nov  9 12:17:06 spaans-smp kernel: Intel MultiProcessor Specification v1.1
Nov  9 12:17:06 spaans-smp kernel:     Virtual Wire compatibility mode.
Nov  9 12:17:06 spaans-smp kernel: OEM ID: OEM00000 Product ID: PROD00000000 APIC at: 0xFEE00000
So, probably the bios does get it wrong -- maybe a reason for a blacklist?
Browsing through the sources, I wasn't able to find any hooks for this; as a
side note, my BIOS seems to set up the OEM ID and Product ID wrongly, but it
does this both in the 1.1 and 1.4 mode.
Well, I'll just put my bios back into the 1.1 mode, and never touch that
setting anymore.
Bye!
