Hello all,
I'm running 2.6.3-mm2 on Debian SID with gcc 3.3.3 (Debian) and my logs
are spammed with the following message:
Feb 22 20:01:24 mhcln03 kernel:      osl-0886 [218724]
os_wait_semaphore     : Failed to acquire semaphore[dff6e680|1|0],
AE_TIME
I've searched Google about this issue but didn't find anything helpful.
Since this system (a Centrino laptop) is running fine (besides borked
ACPI resume-to-$ANYTHING ) i wonder what this message is trying to tell
me.
Details about this laptop (dmesg, lspci etc) can be found here:

TIA & HAND
PS: Please excuse the line breaks. Evolution in SID is kinda borked....
