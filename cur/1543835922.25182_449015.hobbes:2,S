Well, I do have to say that I like the notion of trying to have the _same_ 
semantics for "force_sig_info()" and "force_sig_specific()", so in that 
way your patch is fine - I just missed the fact that it changed it back to 
the old broken ones (that results in endless SIGSEGV's if the SIGSEGV 
happens when setting up the handler for the SIGSEGV and other 
"interesting" issues, where a bug can result in the user process hanging 
instead of just killing it outright).
However, I wonder if the _proper_ fix is to just either remove 
"force_sig_specific()" entirely, or just make that one match the semantics 
of "force_sig_info()" instead (rather than doing it the other way - change 
for_sig_specific() to match force_sig_info()).
force_sig_info() has only two uses, and both should be ok with the 
force_sig_specific() semantics, since they are for SIGSTOP and SIGKILL 
respectively, and those should not be blockable unless you're a kernel 
thread (and I don't think either of them could validly ever be used with 
kernel threads anyway), so doing it the other way around _should_ be ok.
Paul, Suresh, would something like this work for you instead?
