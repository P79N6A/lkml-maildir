We have been looking at write performance with RAM disk, battery backed 
Clariion array & slow laptop drives in another thread on fs-devel, but 
the rough numbers should be interesting.
If you are not doing an fsync() at the end of writing a file, you are 
writing to the page cache (as long as it fits in DRAM) so you are 
basically getting thousands of small files/sec.
We did a test which showed the following for synchronous (fsync()) 
writers of small files with a SLES10/SP1 kernel but the results still 
hold for upstream kernels (at least for the order of magnitude).
Ramdisk test backed testing showed over 4600 small 4k files/sec with 1 
thread.
Midrange array (looks like a ramdisk behind a fibre channel port) hit 
around 778 files/sec with 1 thread.
With a local disk, write cached enabled and barriers on, you are getting 
around 47 4k files/sec.
The tests were run on ext3, different file systems perform differently 
but all fall in the same order of magnitude of performance with the same 
class of storage behind it ;-)
