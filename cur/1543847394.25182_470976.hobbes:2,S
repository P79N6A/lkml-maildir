why not replace the mov+test with "xor %eax,%eax" and then change the 0x75 
to a 0x74 to change from jne to je when you want to enable the marker?
i.e. disabled:
	31 c0	xor %eax,%eax
	75 07	jne 13
enabled:
	31 c0	xor %eax,%eax
	74 07	je 13
it would save 2 bytes, 1 instruction and avoid partial register writes... 
and still has the nice property that a single byte store into the code is 
required for enable/disable (which sounds like a great property -- i 
assume you were deliberately going for that).
i assume there's probably no reason to tie the sequence to eax either -- 
you could let gcc choose it (or maybe you already do).
