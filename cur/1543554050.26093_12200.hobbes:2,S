Should be fine..  If the driver distinguishes between the irqs, maybe
you should do "eth0-rx dma", "eth0-tx dma", etc.

Probably...  but there may be a reason for that, too. 
drivers/net/atp.c, for example, does not use request_region because it
uses the standard parallel ports.  (ideally, of course, it should use
the parport API...)
