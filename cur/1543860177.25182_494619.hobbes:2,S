This is not the corruption Linus is after.  Note that the corruption starts
at offset '1'.  Also note that:
89 = 1113 & 255
93 = 1113 & 255 | (1113 >> 8)
and if you look at glibc's memset() function, you'll notice that's exactly
what you expect if you pass a non-8bit value to it.  Ergo, what you're
seeing is utterly expected given glibc's memset() implementation on ARM.
Fixing Linus' test program to pass nr & 255 to memset results in clean
passes on 2.6.9 on TheCus N2100 (IOP8032x) and 2.6.16.9 StrongARM
machines (as would be expected.)
