Because the pci core sets the needed pci_driver.driver structure fields
that the driver core needs in order to properly hook up things.
I'm considering a change to this that would allow pci (and all other)
driver structures be const, and then dynamically create the needed
driver core structure based on this "template" which would also let us
do some other things that the driver core wants, but that work is a few
months away.  When/if I get to that, I'll go through and mark all of the
driver structures const to move them to the read-only kernel section.
thanks,
