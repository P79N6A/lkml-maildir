Hi all!
Phew... Three hours and I'm starting to have a functional Linux system
once again. I hit quite bad ext2 corruption this afternoon, my root fs was
hosed. Uptime was around one day.
What happened?
==============
1) Came home from work and tried to use some programs, ps and top gave
   corrupted outputs (couple of lines jumbled around text). 
   Decided to reboot...
2) fsck wants to check / - filesystems and gives long list of errors,
   have to run e2fsck manually. New reboot...
3) System boots up, but not fully, many critical /bin/ -files are
   corrupted. 
Nothing suspicious in the kernel log -files.
Cause?
======
I suspect the bttv-driver. Yesterday I set up a webcam software that takes
a picture every five minutes trough a Hauppauge WinTV card and puts it up
on a web page. It had been running the whole day.
About a week ago I got a system hang after I had tried the videostreaming
software from 
http://www.ee.up.ac.za/~justin/bttv/
 . I tried the patch on
the page: 
http://www.ee.up.ac.za/~justin/bttv/bttv-0.5.22.diff
 but it
didn't help. System hanged some time (few hours) after some stream
capturing.
If I don't do any capture operations the systems stays stable... (Uptimes
usually > week before the next kernel patch arrives and I have to reboot
:-)
