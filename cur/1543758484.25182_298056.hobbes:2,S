There is a change to the generic IRQ handling in the ARM RT patch (as of
today) that should be discussed here.
I added a macro define called __ARCH_HAS_IRQ_DESC_T that removes the
generic irq_desc_t and hw_irq_controller if the architecture has them
defined already. I don't see any problems with this, and it makes ARM
integration a little easier . 
I also modified the make files so that individual files in kernel/irq/
can be compiled depending on config options. 
The full ARM RT patch is here,
