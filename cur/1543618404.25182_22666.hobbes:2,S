Just testing with ACPI power saving without amd_disconnect. I'm back to
45°C cpuwise, but without 14% background load from apmd. Looks nicer in
gkrellm, but no measurable/noticable difference otherwise. Will stay at
amd unconnected ACPI power savings for now.
Most important: vlc (CVS 0.2.92) is happily working again.
