Assume a thread is monitoring a set of fd's which include both ends of
a pipe (using poll, for example). If the thread writes to the pipe (in
order to notify itself for whatever reason) is it reasonable to expect
that it will be able to return to its poll loop and get the event
without a context switch? (provided it quickly returns to the poll
loop).
