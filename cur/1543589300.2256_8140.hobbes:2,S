	I have reproduced this on a uniprocessor machine and determined
that it is a bash bug.  I will submit a bash bug report and sample
patch that fixes the problem (but may be incorrect in other ways), and
will cc it to linux-kernel.  Look for the subject "Patch(?): bash-2.05/jobs.c
loses interrupts."
	I have not yet investigated the other report of "sluggish" behavior.
