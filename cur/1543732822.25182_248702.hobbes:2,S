That was one of the examples you gave, that and .jpg.  I believe they
are both ridiculous.

If I understand Hans' plugins, they are not user-loadable, but rather a
statically built part of the kernel.

I would not argue against an encryption plugin.

This I agree with.

As kernel modules, this would make sense.  I don't see just any
unprivileged user being able to add code into the file system, though.

I'm not against reiser4 plugins.  I don't think file system code should
care about the type of data in a file, and do any interpretation based
on it.
