Use the xfs_info command on a mount point:
meta-data=/xfs                   isize=256    agcount=8, agsize=131031
blks
         =                       sectsz=512  
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=1048241, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks, unwritten=1
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096  
log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=16384, version=1
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks
realtime =none                   extsz=65536  blocks=0, rtextents=0
bsize=4096 is the vlock size.
