Hello you all
The uhci-hcd module causes the cpu to work at highest frequecy
(according to x86info -mhz). If I unload it, cpu frequency dropps from full
(1.8GHz) to ~2/3 (1.1GHz). In both cases top shows 97% or even 99% idle.
modprobing it again speeds the cpu up again.
So module uhci-hcd prehibits the cpu clock from saving power on notebooks. (At 
least theese with P4-M cpus)
What code forces the cpu to run at high speed? Can I tweak the module to 
permit slower cpu speed?
