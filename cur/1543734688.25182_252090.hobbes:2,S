Subject: [patch] sched, net: fix scheduling latencies in __release_sock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/14/103

the attached patch fixes long scheduling latencies caused by backlog
triggered by __release_sock(). That code only executes in process
context, and we've made the backlog queue private already at this point
so it is safe to do a cond_resched_softirq().
This patch has been in the -VP patchset for some time.
