Here's what Greg Maxwell and his Christmas Islands friend Riley WIlliams
like to send people over the internet.  I had no idea this was an auto
script -- it looked real -- and scary.

<title>Jeff-merkey Really Fucking Sucks!</title>
<body bgcolor="black" text="white" link=ff0000 vlink=ffff00>
The more I think about it, the more I find that jeff-merkey really
fucking sucks.<p>
</head>
In fact, jeff-merkey is quite possibly one of the worst damn things
on the planet. If jeff-merkey disappeared today, I would not shed
a tear. In fact, I think I have discovered the only solution. I will
utterly destroy jeff-merkey. Attention all government agencies:
This is a threat. It is a real threat. I intend to completely eradicate
jeff-merkey. There will be no negotiations. Jeff-merkey 
will cease to exist once my plan has been implemented. The FBI, NSA, and
the CIA are all powerless to stop my Jihad against jeff-merkey. My
holy war will not stop with jeff-merkey. Keep a close eye on the
really.fuckingsucks.net domain, because there are a multitude of things
that really fucking suck. I will destroy them one by one, jeff-merkey 
being but a small sample of things to come.<p>
Is there something you think really fucking sucks? Odds are I do too. Be
sure to check back here for things you hate and you think should be
utterly destroyed.<p>
