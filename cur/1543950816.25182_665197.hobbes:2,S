And where is the patch to set the system (or cpuset....) default policy? 
;-)
Note that the system default policy changes during bootup. Could that be 
done with the default policy? We had some issues a while back with 
processes spawned at boot inheriting the interleave policy. If they could 
refer to default_policy instead then a change of default_policy would 
switch all spawned processes to use MPOL_DEFAULT?
