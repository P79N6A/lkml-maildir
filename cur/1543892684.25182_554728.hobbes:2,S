Set a flag in the thread-struct.
In fact, that's how "access()" already works.
And yes, syslets would need to have their own thread-structs and/or 
save/restore the thing.

Well, I do suspect that we'd need to basically make the flags be 
per-system call. With "common features" (ie a system call that doesn't 
return a file descriptor would re-use the bit for "nonlinear-fd" for 
something else, while a system call that doesn't do path lookup would use 
all the LOOKUP_xyzzy bits for something else).
I agree that if we kept flags _totally_ separate, we'd run out of them 
really quickly. But I don't think we want to ever be in the situation 
where _one_ set of system calls would need that many flags. If we get 
there, we'd really be much better off with a new system call!

I'd say no.

I think that may well be a really good idea.
