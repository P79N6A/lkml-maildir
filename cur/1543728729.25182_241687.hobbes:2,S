I have been looking, but I cannot find out if anyone has already done 
what I want.
I have a problem that my desktop linux system becomes un-responsive when 
there is a lot of Hard Disc access. I.E. During HD access, the mouse 
fails to move.
I suspect that this is due to a certain kernel process holding onto the 
CPU resources too long without letting the kernel schedule a different 
process.
I therefore need a kernel profiler that will log every kernel 
schedule/context switch, and if the interval between any switch is 
greater than X, it will write a log entry, telling me which 
process/function/module was holding onto the CPU for too long.
I could then use this tool to help me track down exactly where the 
problem is, and therefore hopefully find a fix for it.
Does a tool like this already exist?
