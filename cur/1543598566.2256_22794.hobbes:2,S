[Funny - we just discussed this last week.]
    The kernel has nothing to do with reinitializing the mouse: X has to do
    that.
[Indeed. Or gpm.]
     I plan to submit a
    patch that replaces much of the existing pc keyboard/mouse code with state
    machine driven code that doesn't block interrupts out for long periods of
    time, as well as fixing a few of the lockup issues the current driver has.
Have you written the patch already?
There are interesting difficulties here.
