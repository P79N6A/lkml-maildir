Hi Alexey,
Thanks for the info.
Another thing: sorry for pestering, but I really need to confirm.
With the sll_pkttype parameter, when our machine receives a packet not
destined for it, but rather destined for another host on another interface
(in other words, our machine is functioning as a router), does it still
return the incoming packet as PACKET_HOST or what?
Thanks.
Gerard
