    tcp_fin_timeout is of no help here, since the server is not stuck
in FIN_WAIT2, and in addition to this, the connection is not closed,
that is exactly the problem. tcp_max_orphans refer to TCP connections
not attached to any user file handle, but a connection in state
CLOSE_WAIT is still attached to a file handle, to a valid one indeed.
    A grep in the kernel sources didn't give any useful guide about
which sysctl parameter will help :((
    Thanks anyway, William :) Maybe tcp_max_orphans can help, don't
know.
