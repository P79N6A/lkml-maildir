can you reproduce with 2.4.19pre9aa2? I expect at least the deadlock
(if it's a deadlock and not a livelock) should go away.
Also I read in another email that somebody grown the per-socket buffer
to hundred mbytes, if you do that on a 32bit arch with highmem you'll
run into troubles, too much ZONE_NORMAL ram will be constantly pinned
for the tcp pipeline and the machine can enter livelocks.
