In that case, A should insert the dependency into the
freeze_me_first_list as B is unaware of the dependency yet.
What if by the time A has inserted the dependency B is already frozen?
Can very well happen right?
A:			B:			freezer

Example: A = a thread doing flush_workqueue.
	 B = worker thread.
Of course, we can always use the freezer_skip around this
wait_for_completion as well as long as the thread A is not marked
PF_NOFREEZE. But with multiple freeze events, it won't be as simple as
that.
