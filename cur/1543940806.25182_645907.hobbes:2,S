Subject: [GIT PULL] dlm updates for 2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Linus,
Please pull dlm updates for 2.6.25 from:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/teigland/dlm.git for-linus
In the past, the dlm patches went through the gfs2 git tree.  We've moved
to a separate tree because the dlm work is now largely independent from
gfs2, and dlm patches are mostly relevant for other applications.
There are no new features, only fixes for various bugs or problems.  They
stem mainly from mixed architecture testing, and new tests that overlap
recovery with userland stress tests.
Thanks,
Dave
