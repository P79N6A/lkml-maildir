If by people you mean developer, I might agree. If by people you mean
user, I disagree.
As a Linux user, the only reason I do cdrecord -scanbus is to comply
to the cdrecord way of doing likes. I don't personally like it.
I'd rather use /dev/cdrw, in a machine independent way, as in:
  ssh user@host cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrw /path/to/file.iso
