Jeff,
I resubmit the patch supporting the latest Chelsio T3 adapter.
It incorporates the last feedbacks for code cleanup.
It is built gainst Linus'tree.
We think the driver is now ready to be merged.
Can you please advise on the next steps for inclusion in 2.6.20 ?
A corresponding monolithic patch is posted at the following URL:
http://service.chelsio.com/kernel.org/cxgb3.patch.bz2
This driver is required by the Chelsio T3 RDMA driver
which was updated on 12/10/2006.
Cheers,
Divy
