To stay on systems probably more familiar to the user who asked this 
question, there are also some 64 core X86_64 bot AMD and Intel out there, 
here the 2.6 kernel is doing 
very well even on those intel CPU with shared L2 cache.
I have some 16 and 32 core Opteron and never had scalability problems.
You have to pay a lot of attention to your kernel configuration  (100 HZ, 
just BKL preemption), and to the 
filesystems you decide to use.
