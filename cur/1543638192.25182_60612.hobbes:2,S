My own PAS16 sports the following chips (may have misidentified their 
function):
MV Spectrum MVD101D - Multimedia controller (native interface)
MV Spectrum MVA416  - PCM
MV Spectrum MVA508  - Mixer
MV Thunder  MVD201A - SB Pro compatible part
and a 28MHz oscilator (which is I believe relevant since not all PASs use the 
same clock or something)
Note: the PAS16 is not SB Pro compatible, it just /has/ an SB Pro compatible 
part; with the current OSS drivers you get /dev/{audio,dsp,mixer}{0,1} with 0 
being the native PAS16 stuff and, unless you disable it, 1 the SBP stuff
The card's quirky in that it doesn't seem to (directly, natively) support a 
44100 sampling rate; I had to resample to a supported rate to get it to 
produce something audible under Linux. The Windows driver seems to compensate 
for that automagically (and has that "28MHz clock source" as a driver 
option). Simply catting an .au to /dev/audio0 does let Linus pronounce Linux 
(in both Swedish and English) though.
