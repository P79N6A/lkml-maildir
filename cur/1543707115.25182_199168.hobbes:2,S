Are ou sure? 
My scanner works well (excepted if i unplug it-> kernel oops) with the 
deprecated module and isn't reconised without.
I have usb libraries and  hotplug installed, and i am running kernel 2.6.2 
also.
I am sorry but I will use this deprecated module until my scanner is reconised 
without.
