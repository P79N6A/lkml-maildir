The VSA CGA/EGA/VGA text emulation seems to be rather awful and has
lots of bugs.  Compile in the VESA framebuffer support in your Linux
kernel and add vga=785 (see linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt) to
your kernel command line.  It's a choice of:
    Linux kernel frobs the text console -> buggy VSA emulation -> framebuffer
or
    Linux kernel frobs the framebuffer directly
Guess which works better?  *grin*
