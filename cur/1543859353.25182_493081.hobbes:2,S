Exactly, those "power" files actually pre-date the actual tree of
devices itself.  They were just holders for what the original developer
thought was going to be needed, but was never properly implemented due
to some job changes (note, this was not myself...)

I would be very interested to see any newer SuSE programs using that
interface.  Just point them out to me and I'll quickly fix them.
And yes, as a SuSE developer (and one of the people in charge of the
SuSE kernels), I have no problem with these files just going away.
Because, as David keeps repeating, they are broken and wrong.
