Userspace would have to tell the kernel which set of devices is
available.  (In your example:  The set consists of m1 and m2; but does
not include m0 nor m3 nor m6391.)
So instead of telling the kernel beforehand what to enqueue for
registration and in which order to enqueue it, we simply let userspace
give persistent alias names to devices after the fact.
