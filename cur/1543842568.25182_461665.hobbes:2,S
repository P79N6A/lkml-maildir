Oh, we know about this.  The powerpc writel() used to have memory
barriers in 2.4 kernels but not any more in 2.6 kernels.  Red Hat's
version of tg3 has extra wmb()'s to fix this problem.  David doesn't
think that the upstream version of tg3 should have these wmb()'s, and
the problem should instead be fixed in powerpc's writel().
