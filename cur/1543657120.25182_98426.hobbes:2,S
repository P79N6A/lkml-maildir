With Jurriaan's hack 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/radeon.tgz
should work - it is 2.4.18 version of driver ported to 2.5.50. Only thing I can
say about it is that it works on my Compaq notebook in 1600x1200, with 
2.5.51-bkSomething.
I did not talked to Ani Joshi about it yet, as it does not work in latest 2.5.x
kernels, so as is patch is of no use for anyone using 2.5.52+.
