fair enough. there may be times when people won't agree when something
is actually "deprecated."  but in cases of actual disagreement, the
easiest solution is to do nothing -- leave that feature untagged, it
won't hurt anything.  it would be like arguing about whether something
should currently depend on EXPERIMENTAL.  who cares?  a user can
simply click on whether they want to see EXPERIMENTAL stuff, anyway.
the places where this makes sense is where everyone agrees that
something is now officially deprecated -- like when it gets its own
entry in the features removal file with a scheduled removal date.
once that happens, it's beyond the point of debate.
but so what if something gets mis-classified every so often?  you
always have the ability to ignore all that attribute classification in
the end, anyway.  no harm, no foul.
