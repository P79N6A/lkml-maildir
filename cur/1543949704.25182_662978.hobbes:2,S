This is sort of an extension to the per-task area. And this needs to be done
before any task starts using this state. Thought this is the nice place to
initialize the extension caches along with the main task_struct init.

Not an oversight. setup_thread_stack comes with its own baggage called
__HAVE_THREAD_FUNCTIONS. Thought of keeping this simple and separate
by using an inline or weak linkage.

hmm.. any better suggestion?
