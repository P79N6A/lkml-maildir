True, that is done, but we then discard this packet at the very first
moment we know it's not for a special socket. This way we know this
piece of memory will not get stuck waiting on some unimportant blocked
process. So even though we allocate the packet we do not loose the
memory.

I've done that throughout the patches, in various forms of brokenness.
Only with this full allocator could I implement all the semantics needed
for all skb operations though.
Previous attempts had some horrors build on alloc_pages() in there.

I have looked at setsockopt(), but since I'm not sure I want to expose
this to userspace I chose to not do that.
