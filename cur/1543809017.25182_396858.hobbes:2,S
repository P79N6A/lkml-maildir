Ah sorry about that.  You were just about to go to LCA when that came
up, so I figured I'd wait until you had time to look at it again :)
There's a log at 
http://people.redhat.com/davej/Xorg.0.log
That doesn't have drm disabled, but it is being run on a kernel
with the pci id commented out.  I'm a bit reluctant to reboot
the workstation to try a non-drm enabled X at the moment, until
some stuff finishes.  Let me know if that log is insufficient or not.
