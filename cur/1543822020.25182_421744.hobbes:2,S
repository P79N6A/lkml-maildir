Point is, sometimes you have plenty of enthropy available and
sometimes you only have the network card (and maybe an HD). Two
different situations, in one of them we can accept (it's even beter)
not acquiring enthropy from the network card completely.

Agreed

Yes, that situation is pretty common.
Here is my point: I don't think the kernel shoud "try very hard" to
fix "lack of good enthropy sources". Yes, you've presented situations
where someone (ultimately) could guess what is being read from
/dev/random.
In practice, though, it should ultimatelly fall upon the
end-user/developer to have a system with good enough (for him/her)
enthropy sources. If he is happy with lots of "bad enthropy" so be it.
Hovever, if he wants / needs to be sure that /dev/random is not
predictable, (IMHO) he can always plug a hardware RNG and only read
from that (hence what I said about configuring who are your enthropy
sources).
