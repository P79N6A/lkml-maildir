That patch is in the -mm tree, and has been there for a while, so it is 
pretty much stable by now. There were 4 seperate patches, but since they 
were pretty much dependant, I think akpm merged them into 
"kallsyms-data-size-reduction--lookup-speedup.patch".
For those who don't know what the patch is about, it changes the format 
of the compressed kallsyms, so that they occupy less space, decompress 
faster (a lot faster) and include the same type char that was output by nm.
The code in kernel/kallsyms.c handles "aliases" (symbols with the same 
address) in a way that it shows a consistent output: the symbol shown is 
always the first. This can be easily changed, but I didn't want to 
change the old behavior.
The patch by Russel King seems ok to me, although I prefer Rusty's idea 
of not using any symbol that is not in the form "[A-Za-z0-9_]+". We just 
need to check if there are any real world users of these "weird" symbols.
If this seems ok to everyone I can cook up a patch to do this.
