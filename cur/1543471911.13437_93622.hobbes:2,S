Have you experimented with different RAID chunk sizes? The way
accesses are distributed across disks in RAID 0 or 1 pairs
tends to mean that, for sequential access greater than the
chunk size, you read n sectors, skip n sectors, read n sectors, etc.
This interacts badly with some drives caching strategies.
  As I mentioned in a previous message my own experimentation
with a pair of Seagates (ST15150s) show that a chunk size of 32k
pretty much doubles the throughput when they are paired in a
RADI0 group. *Any* other chunk size causes such a collapse in
throughput that it is barely better than a single drive could
manage. It sounds like this is what is happening to you.
