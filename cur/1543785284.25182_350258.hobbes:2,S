The bootblock code is 497 bytes long. It must as simple as possible.
Complex algorithms like fingerprinting can't be used.
Geometry detection works with usual floppies. This patch goal is to
support them like < 2.6 bootblocks did and fix 1M limitation and
special formatting like 1.68M floppies.
Geometry detection may work with non-traditional floppies but is not
designed to.
BTW, if this kind of floppies doesn't handle error, it's a bug in the
firmware, but not in bootblock code !

1.44M floppies are told dead for more than 10 years. In 2005 most of
computers are sold with these drives. Sometime I have to boot with
a floppy when nothing works (blush).
Kernel code is always growing. The bootblock spares filesystem and
external kernel loader overhead.
While linux kernel has a floppy driver the bootblock is usefull.
Now two solutions:
- without this patch = linux kernel are never directly bootable
- with this patch = linux kernel is directly bootable with some
  devices.
What is the better idea ?
