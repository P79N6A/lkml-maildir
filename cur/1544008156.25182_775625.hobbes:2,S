We also need to document that we depend on this reference in the hash to
keep the object around.  Take a look at cr_read_fd_data().  Once that
cr_attach_file() has been performed, the only thing keeping the 'file'
around is the hash reference.  If someone happened to remove it from the
hash, the vfs_llseek() below would be bogus.
I don't know how we document that the hash is one-way: writes only and
no later deletions.
