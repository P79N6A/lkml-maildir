Yeah, and I'm claiming that databases etc count for a whole lot less than
most other apps.

Oh, not Itanium for sure. But if AMD succeeds even reasonably with Hammer,
Intel will certainly see the error of its ways (except they won't admit
it) and make their version of a 64-bit P4 core available. They're
reportedly working on it already, just in case the Itanic sinks (and
judging by current market behaviour it certainly isn't flying).

That's not an umlaut, that's an "ä", which is a real letter in Finnish and
Swedish (it just _looks_ like an a with an umlaut to you uncultured
people), and it happens to be a letter that is just left of the ' mark on
a Finnish keyboard.
