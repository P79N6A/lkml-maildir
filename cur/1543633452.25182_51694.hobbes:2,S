The better way to solve this is to include:
/*
 * Overrides for Emacs so that we follow Linus's tabbing style.
 * Emacs will notice this stuff at the end of the file and automatically
 * adjust the settings for this buffer only.  This must remain at the end
 * of the file.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Local variables:
 * c-indent-level: 8
 * c-brace-imaginary-offset: 0
 * c-brace-offset: -8
 * c-argdecl-indent: 8
 * c-label-offset: -8
 * c-continued-statement-offset: 8
 * c-continued-brace-offset: 0
 * End:
 */
at the end of each file these people who cannot use their editor touch.
That's how I solved it with my own team mates ;-)
