I can confine a process to my idea of it's expected behavior.

I can guarantee that if my profile does not allow write access to /etc
that apache's write to "/etc/new_file" will not be allowed.
The argument that somehow someone would setup a soft link or something
so that apache could write to /etc via indirection is not my primary
concern.  That is systematic of a more concerted attack and a very
determined attacker.  Or at the very least, a mistake on my part. And
in that case, I cannot protect myself from myself.

I have no requirements like that. I just would prefer that when people
try to exploit my internet services, that the programs are not allowed
to do things that I would rather it not do. AA seems to fulfill that
requirement.
