Hi,
sorry, the problem was just caused by an empty line in front of a closing
bracket... This somehow removed some (although not all) of the safe_for_read
commands from the list.
I thought I had missed some piece of information here, but it were just my
bad editing skills :-)
Sorry for bothering! Everything works fine now that I added some commands.
Thanks for all your help!
cu,
Frank
