Subject: question regarding to NFS synchronous writes on metadata

Hi,
I was told that NFS writes metadata synchronously even if the
directory is exported and mounted with 'async' option. Is this true?
If so, can someone point me to the place where the client write
metadata synchronously to the server and the server writes the
metadata synchronously to the disk?
Many thanks!
