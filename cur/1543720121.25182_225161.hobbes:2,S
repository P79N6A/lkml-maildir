Paulus brought this up on IRC, it seems to be a bad DRM merge: The code
#ifndef VMAP_4_ARGS
       if ( dev->agp->cant_use_aperture )
               return -EINVAL;
#endif
in DRM(agp_acquire) should be removed altogether in a 2.6 kernel because
its vmap() takes 4 arguments; however, only the guards seem to have been
removed, which causes this function to erroneously fail if the AGP
aperture can't be directly accessed by the CPU.
