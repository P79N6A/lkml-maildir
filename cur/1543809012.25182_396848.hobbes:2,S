A very good question.  Supporting waitpid and the normal process management
semantics seems to be a requirement for usability.  Completely separate pid
spaces would probably be easier to implement.  However then we would need
to implement another interface like waitpid to allow for notifications when
the all of the processes exited.
I have not seen any alternatives being proposed to handle that case.

Largely correct.  Looking at it from the outside is like looking at a thread
group leader.  Sometimes you see the leader sometimes you see the entire
group of processes.

Sure.  Any attempt to build a general purpose mechanism will suffer from
that.  But it is easy enough to drop the external references from the
init processes, and then it's children don't have a chance to get them.

It's not sloth.  Simply trying to extend the existing API.  Not changing
what doesn't need to be changed is a virtue.
But yes fully isolated pid spaces are unmanageable unless you add and API
to deal with it.  My api is using the wid to allow a parent process to manage
it essentially like normal.

You also don't find them interesting enough to implement.  Or else we are using
the same terms to mean different things.

Sure you need to introduce new semantics, etc.  But nothing more
than what you already have in OpenVZ.  The only necessary difference
is in how you name the process.   The target process is still being
manipulated by a process outside of it's scope of existence.
So if the need for doing that is as great as you say it is something
that is doable, and their may be other methods that are easier to work
with.
Personally I only implemented as much manipulation of the init
processes as I did because it came for free.  I don't see the need
to manipulate a process in another pid namespace.
