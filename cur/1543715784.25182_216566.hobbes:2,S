Why not make a program that does all of this from userspace?  It would
turn off the proper CPUs, memory, and pci slots for a specific "board".
Otherwise you are going to have to either:
	- hook the current CPU, memory, and pci hotplug code to allow it
	  to be called from within the kernel
	- have your kernel code write to a the sysfs files from within
	  kernelspace.
Neither of which are acceptable things :(
