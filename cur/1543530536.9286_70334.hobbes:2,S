Yes, you COULD have COW without overcommitting - but you still lose one of
the major benefits of COW, namely huge savings on VM usage. If I fork()
100 Apache processes of 20Mb each, I need perhaps 30Mb of VM total.
WITHOUT overcommitted COW, I end up needing 2Gb of swap space - 1.98Gb of
which I will never use! This is certainly not an efficient use of swap
space, IMO...
