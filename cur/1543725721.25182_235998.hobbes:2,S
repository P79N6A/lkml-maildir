Yeah that is like what I had in mind.
You might have the theoretical problem of ending up with more than
one disjoint top level domain (ie. no overlap, basically partitioning
the CPUs).
No doubt you could come up with something provably correct, however
it might just be good enough to examine the end result and check that
it is good. At least while you test different configurations.
