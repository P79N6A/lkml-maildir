The problem with linux/irq.h is that it makes many assumptions about the
per-architecture irq code.  If anyone needs to include it (in its current
form), then they're accessing architecture private data that may or may
not be present.
Maybe the correct thing would be to move linux/irq.h to linux/hw_irq.h
(so it matches asm/hw_irq.h) and move request_irq() and friends into a
new linux/irq.h
