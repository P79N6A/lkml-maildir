hm. I'd suggest to do this without changing request_irq() - and then we 
could avoid the 'massive, every driver affected' change, right?
i.e. because we'll (have to) have an nr_to_desc() and desc_to_nr() 
mapping facility anyway, lets just not change the driver APIs massively. 
There dont seem to be that many drivers that assume that irq_desc[] is 
an array - are there?
otherwise, in terms of the irqchips infrastructure and the API between 
genirq and the irqchip arch-level drivers, this change makes quite a bit 
of sense i think.
or am i missing something fundamental?
