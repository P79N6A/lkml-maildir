Hello All,
 I am experiencing complete system lockup rather too frequently with and SMP
kernel 2.2.13. It seems to happen just after authentication on dialin when
pppd is
setting up the IP connection. Has anyone else seen this? What could be the
cause?
Dialout using ISDN/ppp seems to be fine.
Thanks in advance,
Nicholas Waltham
