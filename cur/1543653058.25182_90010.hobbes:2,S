Subject: RFC: [2.5 patch] Create a "Subarchitecture" menu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

My impression is that it's currently easy to accidentially activate the
Voyager support in 2.5.47 by typing once too often "y" which results in
a kernel that doesn't boot on a PC. The patch below is a suggestion to
to create a "Subarchitecture" choice.
The wording might not be perfect and it might make sense to add other
subarchs there, too. I'm interested in comments whether this is a good
idea or whether there are reasons why this is a bad idea.
TIA
Adrian
