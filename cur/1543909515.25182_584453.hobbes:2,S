OK, that makes sense and is reassuring, but note that some MIPS boxes
have only part of their physical memory below 1GB; IIRC the
BCM4704/BCM5836 supports up to 512MB of physical memory, with 256MB in
the first GB and the second 256MB located above the 1GB line.  (But it's
been a while since I've run such a machine, so I could be misremembering
the sizes and offsets.)
Yeah, if you stick a PCI chip with a 30-bit PCI DMA mask into a machine
with memory above 1GB, then copying has to happen.  Unless the memory
allocator can avoid returning memory in the un-dma-able region...
