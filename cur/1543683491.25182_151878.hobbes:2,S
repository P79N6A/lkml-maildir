Thank you very much for your answer mr Neakum,
Funny, but now i did the menuconfig again and clear, dep, bzImage, modules
and it is ok, maybe i missed removing some module before as i want to
compile a quite light kernel.
Many times i wanted to compile a kernel with just a fiew options and get
some errors, and when want to kompile with lot of options it's ok. I guess
there are some dependency problems, which are not handled properly by make
dep? And i heard somewhere that it is a common error.
Is there a dedicated site, forum about this problem?
Thanks again!
