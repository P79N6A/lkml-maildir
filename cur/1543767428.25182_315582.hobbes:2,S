The 2 processes which I  am measuring  are parent and child processes.I want 
both of'em to be scheduled at the same time.My code simply does the 
following:
1) From main(i.e., parent) create a shared memory seg. using shmget() and 
shmat(). This is for communication between parent and child. I am trying to 
use this as a locking mechanism to make them tightly coupled so that one 
does not race before the other.
2) create child by fork() and call shmat() to attach this segment to child 
too
3) In parent and child call ioctl() to pass their PID's from user space to 
kernel space...so that I can measure when the particular PID's are scheduled 
in the scheduler
I suppose shmget() dosent use a system call.So still confused about the 
occasional resechedule behavior.
