Ok, state 'this allows nasty user to induce failures in setgid
programs it execs' in changelog when you submit.
No, I do not think 'safe enough' is good enough for little or no gain.

...as does someone who introduces known-bad security-related changes
withou *very* good reason.

'on most systems' is keyword here, and remember that other ways of
inducing fork failures are normally very easy to detect.
Also... fork was first example. There are probably better examples.

Yes. Any setuid/setgid exec is a security barrier, and weird (or new)
semantics may not cross that barrier.

Go for security here. (Normally, consensus on the list is needed for
merging the patch).

No, I meant 'teach users to remove CAP_REG_XUID_EXEC when removing
others'.

Agreed, I'd call that slightly ugly.

...so you prefer enabling DoS attack on the core file. I bet some
combination of your new capabilities will allow game to lock the core
file, but make it crash without unlocking it.
Or do you volunteer to audit all the games in Debian each time new
capability is added? :-)
