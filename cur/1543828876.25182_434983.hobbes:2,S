Hi Jouni,
I have problem with 2.6.17 kernel.
When I insert card or boot with card in pcmcia slot, kernel always freezes!
dmesg:
hostap_cs: Registered netdevice wifi0
unexpected IRQ trap at vector b0
hostap_cs: index 0x01, irq3, io 0x3100-0x313f
kernel freeze
up to 2.6.16 everythink worked fine!
Can you please fix this ASAP? This is my only connection to the internet.
Thanks
Michal
