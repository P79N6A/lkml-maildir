I had wondered where he'd gone to - Jeff was one of the few from who I
read every email, and it's been a while since I saw anything from him.

I offered to go through Configure.help and split it up a while back, and
I was drowned in several dozen emails saying that such was a BAD THING,
with absolutely zilch saying otherwise. I'm more than willing to have a
go at splitting it up into separate files by directory, but before I do,
I would need to know how you wished to deal with symbols that are
referenced all over the source tree rather than just in a single
directory.
Another thing I'd like to do is to introduce a "boilerplate" mechanism
whereby help text that's repeated in multiple options gets stored just
once and dragged in when it's needed. I've made a start on doing that
with the current Configure.help file and the `make config` and `make
menuconfig` commands, and have patches available against the 2.0.39,
2.2.20 and 2.4.17 trees to provide the base implementation for `make
config` but gather that such is pointless as those commands will soon be
extracted from the Linux kernel.
Best wishes from Riley.
