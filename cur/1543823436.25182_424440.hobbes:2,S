I noticed that you added the mask inside the case while Nathan
added it outside. So, he did it for all nVidia silicon.
I would think it may be better if he tested your patch very
exactly on top of a clean kernel (e.g. make sure that his own
patch is not in the way), and also sent us the lspci output
with the chip revision numbers.
