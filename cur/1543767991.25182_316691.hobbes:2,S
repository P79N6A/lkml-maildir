Obviously it must be a tree of CPU groups. CPUs in one NUMA node go into
one group, multi-core CPUs have all cores in one group and HT is a group,
too. This will scale from UP (degenerated tree with just one CPU) to
clusters with multicore HT-capable CPUs on PCI boards.
e.g. if you choose to represent it as a string:
Object            = <Offline-Indicator>? (<CPU>|<Group>) <Details>?
Offline-Indicator = "-"
CPU               = qr/[a-z0-9_]+/ # or more restrictive
Group             = "[" (<Object>)("," <Object>)* "]"
Details           = "{" (<vardef)("," <Vardef>)* "}"
Vardef            = <Key> "=" <Value> # or "=>" if you think perl
Key               = qr/[a-z0-9_]+/
Value             = qr/"([^"\000]|"")*"/
The described board in a UP system might look like:
[cpu0{speed="4.77MHz", RAM="80KB"},
 [[[boardcpu0_0, boardcpu0_0_ht]{group="ht"},
   [boardcpu0_1, boardcpu0_1_ht]{group="ht"}],
  [[boardcpu1_0, boardcpu1_0_ht]{group="ht"},
   [boardcpu1_1, boardcpu1_1_ht]{group="ht"}]{group="numa",RAM="4GB"}]
To count them, do:
#/usr/bin/perl
s/"[^"]*"//g;
s/\{[^}]*\}//g;
$numcpus=s/,/,/g + 1;
