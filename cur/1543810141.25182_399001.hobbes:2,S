Likely -EUDEV?

The minor numbers can be assigned dyanmically if
CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set, so it may be even confusing to list
up there as if static only.

If you hear something, it's definitely a mixer configuration problem,
maybe screwed up by some reason.  In such a case, it's easier to
re-initialize from the scratch:
Unload the module first, then remove /etc/asound.state (or whatever
the distro uses) to prevent the automatic "alsactl restore".
Reload the module, then unmute/adjust the volume "PCM" and "Master".
The other volumes should have been initialized to be audible.
