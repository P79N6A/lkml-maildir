OK, here's the latest Linux 2.4 issues/bug list, to celebrate the
rebirth of the linux-kernel list.  :-)
As always, please let me know if there are any corrections that need to
be made to this list, and remember that the version of at the web page

                         Linux 2.4 Status/TODO Page
                                      
   This list is almost always out of date, by definition, since kernel
   development moves so quickly. I try to keep it as up to date as
   possible, though.  Please send updates to tytso@mit.edu.
   
   Every few days or so, I periodically send updated versions of this
   list to the linux-kernel list, but you should consult
   
http://linux24.sourceforge.net
 to get the latest information.

   Hopefully up to date as of: test7-pre5
   
1. Should Be Fixed (Confirmation Wanted)
     * Fbcon races (cursor problems when running continual streaming
       output mixed with printk + races when switching from X while doing
       continuous rapid printing --- Alan)
       
2. Capable Of Corrupting Your FS
     * Use PCI DMA by default in IDE is unsafe (must not do so on via
       VPx, x < 3) (requires chipset tuning to be enabled according to
       Andre Hedrick --- we need to turn this on by default -- TYT)
     * Fix the OOPS in usb-storage from the error-recovery handler.
       (reported by Matthew Dharm)
     * Innd data corruption, probably caused by bug in filemap.c? (Rik
       van Riel)
       
3. Security
     * Fix module remove race bug (still to be done: TTY, ldisc, I2C,
       video_device - Al Viro) (Rogier Wolff will handle ATM) (ipchains
       modules -- Rusty)
       
4. Boot Time Failures
     * Use PCI DMA 'lost interrupt' problem with some hw [which ?] (NEC
       Versa LX with PIIX tuning)
     * HT6560/UMC8672 ide sets up stuff too early (before region stuff
       can be done)
     * Crashes on boot on some Compaqs ? (may be fixed)
     * Boot hangs on a range of Dell docking stations (Latitude)
          + Almost certainly related: PCI code doesn't see devices behind
            DECchip 21150 PCI bridges (used in Dell Latitude). Reported
            by Simon Trimmer .
          + Derek Fawcus at Cisco reports similar problems with Toshiba
            Tecra 8000 attached to the DeskStation V+ docking station.
            (once again, caused by bridge returning 0 when reading the
            I/O base/limit and Memory base/limit registers which confuses
            the new PCI resource code).
     * Some Ultra-I sbus sparc64 systems fail to boot since 2.4.0-test3,
       may be due to specific memory configurations.
     * IBM Thinkpad 390 won't boot since 2.3.11 (See Decklin Foster for
       more info)
       
5. Compile errors
     * netfilter doesn't compile correctly (test7-pre3, reported by Pau
       Aliagas)
     * If all the ISO NLS's are modules, there can be an undefined ref to
       CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT in inode.c (Dale Amon)
       
6. In Progress
     * Finish I2O merge (Intel/Alan)
     * Restore O_SYNC functionality (Stephen) - core code and ext2 done
     * Fix all remaining PCI code to use pci_enable_device (mostly done)
     * Fix, um, interesting races around dup2() and friends. (Al Viro)
     * Finish the audit/code review of the code dealing with descriptor
       tables. (Al Viro)
     * NCR5380 isnt smp safe (Frank Davis)
     * DMFE is not SMP safe (Frank Davis)
     * Audit all char and block drivers to ensure they are safe with the
       2.3 locking - a lot of them are not especially on the
       read()/write() path. (Frank Davis)
       
7. Obvious Projects For People (well if you have the hardware..)
     * Make syncppp use new ppp code
     * Fix SPX socket code
       
8. Fix Exists But Isnt Merged
     * Update SGI VisWS to new-style IRQ handling (Ingo)
     * Support MP table above 1Gig (Ingo)
     * Dont panic on boot when meeting HP boxes with wacked APIC table
       numbering (AC)
     * Scheduler bugs in RT (Dimitris)
     * AIC7xxx doesnt work non PCI ? (Doug says OK, new version due
       anyway)
     * Fix boards with different TSC per CPU and kill TSC use on them
     * Floppy last block cache flush error
     * PPC-specific: won't boot on 601 CPU's (powermac) (Andreas Tobler;
       Paul Mackerras has fix in PPC tree)
     * IRDA fixes (patches from Russell King sent to Linus and DAG)
          + IRDA calls get_random_bytes before random is set up 
          + Infinite loop in IrDA parameter code
          + Device name in /proc/net/irda/irias is not updated when
            /proc/sys/net/irda/devname is written
          + IrDA Discovery slot allocation is not random
     * Splitting a posix lock causes an infinite loop (Stephen Rothwell)
     * Symbol clashes from ppp and irda compression code (Arjan van de
       Ven)
       
9. To Do
     * Check all devices use resources properly (Everyone now has to use
       request_region and check the return since we no longer single
       thread driver inits in all module cases. Also memory regions are
       now requestable and a lot of old drivers dont know this yet. --
       Alan Cox)
     * Tulip hang on rmmod/crashes sometimes
     * Devfs races (mostly done - Al Viro)
     * Fix further NFS races (Al Viro)
     * Test other file systems on write
     * Fix mount failures due to copy_* user mishandling
     * Check all file systems are either LFS compliant or error large
       files
     * Issue with notifiers that try to deregister themselves? (lnz;
       notifier locking change by Garzik should backed out, according to
       Jeff)
     * Mount of new fs over existing mointpoint should return an error
       unless forced (Andrew McNabb, Alan Cox)
     * Kernel build has race conditions when building modversions.h
       (Mikael Pettersson)
     * Misc locking problems
          + drivers/pcmcia/ds.c: ds_read & ds_write. SMP locks are
            missing, on UP the sleep_on() use is unsafe.
          + drivers/usb/*.c
               o unsafe sleep_on in ibmcam and ov511 drivers
               o usbpl_{read,write}(): on UP concurrent read/write
                 operations could corrupt the urb structures if
                 copy_to_user sleeps, on SMP it's worse.
          + do_execve (Al Viro, reported by Manfred)
          + fix the quota races (Al Viro)
          + complete the ext2 races fixes (truncate) (Al Viro)
          + fix the UFS, minixfs and sysvfs SMP races(the latter couple
            is broken as ext2 was, UFS is _completely_ broken; eats
            filesystems) (Al Viro)
     * Fix sysinfo interface so it is binary compatible with 2.2.x (i.e.
       mem_unit=1), except when memory >= 4Gb (Erik Andersen)
     * SCSI CD-ROM doesn't work on filesystems with < 2kb block size
       (Jens Axboe will fix)
     * Audit list of drivers that dereference ioremap's return (Abramo
       Bagnara)
     * 2.4.0-test2 breaks the behaviour of the ether=0,0,eth1 boot
       parameter (dwguest)
     * Writing to tapes > 2.4G causes tar to fail with EIO (using
       2.4.0-test7-pre5; it works under 2.4.0-test1-ac18 --- Tigran
       Aivazian)
     * USB Pegasus driver explodes on disconnect (lots of printk and/or
       OOPS spewage to the console. David Ford)
       
10. To Do But Non Showstopper
     * Go through as 2.4pre kicks in and figure what we should mark
       obsolete for the final 2.4 (i.e. XT hard disk support?)
     * Union mount (Al Viro)
     * Per Process rtsigio limit
     * iget abuse in knfsd
     * Some people report 2.3.x serial problems
     * ISAPnP IRQ handling failing on SB1000 + resource handling bug
     * Parallel ports should set SA_SHIRQ if PCI (eg in Plip)
     * Devfs compiled in but not mounted causes crap for ->mnt_devname of
       root (Al Viro)
     * PCMCIA/Cardbus hangs (Basically unusable - Hinds pcmcia code is
       reliable)
          + PCMCIA crashes on unloading pci_socket
     * RTL 8139 cards sometimes stop responding. Both drivers don't
       handle this quite good enough yet. (reported by Rogier Wolff)
     * ATM phy-chip-driver interface change for Firestream ATM card
       (Rogier Wolff)
       
11. To Check
     * Check O_APPEND atomicity bug fixing is complete
     * Protection on i_size (sct) [Al Viro mostly done]
     * Mikulas claims we need to fix the getblk/mark_buffer_uptodate
       thing for 2.3.x as well
     * Network block device seems broken by block device changes
     * VFS?VM - mmap/write deadlock (demo code seems to show lock is
       there)
     * kiobuf seperate lock functions/bounce/page_address fixes
     * Fix routing by fwmark
     * rw semaphores on inodes to fix read/truncate races ? [Probably
       fixed]
     * Not all device drivers are safe now the write inode lock isnt
       taken on write
     * Multiwrite IDE breaks on a disk error [minor issue at best]
       (hopefully fixed)
     * ACPI/APM suspend issue - IDE related stuff ? (requires full
       taskfile support that was vetoed by Linus)
     * NFS bugs are fixed
     * Chase reports of SMB not working
     * Some AWE cards are not being found by ISAPnP ??
     * SHM segments not always being detached and destroyed right ?
       (problem reported by Lincoln Dale)
     * RAM disk contents vanishing on cramfs (block change) and bforget
       cases
     * ACPI hangs on boot for some systems (Are there any cases left ?)
     * Disappointing performance of Software Raid, esp. write performance
       (reported by Nils Rennebarth)
     * List of potential problems found by Stanford students using g++
       hacks:
          + Andy Chou's list of mismatched spinlocks and interrupts/bh
            enable/disable.
          + Seth Andrew Hallem's list potentially sleeping functions
            called with interrupts off or spinlocks held.
          + Dawson Engler's list of potential kmalloc/kfree bugs
     * Potential races in file locking code (Christian Ehrhardt)
          + locks_verify_area checks the wrong range if O_APPEND is set
            and the current file position is not at the end of the file.
          + dito if the file position changes between the call to
            locks_verify_area and the actual read/write (requires a
            shared file pointer, an attacker can use this to circumvent
            virtually any mandatory lock).
          + active writes should prevent anyone from getting mandatory
            locks for the area beeing written.
          + active reads should prevent anyone from getting mandatory
            write locks for the area beeing read.
     * Possible ppp problem (fail to connect; may be user error; reported
       by Matt Spong; claims worked on 2.3.40)
       
12. Probably Post 2.4
     * per super block write_super needs an async flag
     * addres_space needs a VM pressure/flush callback (Ingo)
     * per file_op rw_kiovec
     * rw sempahores on page faults (mmap_sem) (Currently protected by
       mmap_sem)

     * PCMCIA IRQ routing should now be fixed modulo ISA cards and bios
       doesn't tell us that an IRQ is ISA-only (Martin Mares)
     * TB Multisound driver hasnt been updated for new isa I/O totally.
       (reported fixed by John Coiner; see
       
http://atv.ne.mediaone.net/linux-multisound
)
     * yenta (PCMCIA) and pci_socket modules have mutual dependency
       (cardbus_register, yenta_operations) (test5, worked in test3)
       (reported fixed by Erik Mouw)
     * Keyboard/mouse problems (should be fixed?)
     * Loop device hangs (Peter Enderborg can duplicate by writing large
       file to dosfs mounted via loop device; Steve Dodd reports deadlock
       issues; Linus says fixed in test6)
     * Floppy driver broken by VFS changes. Other drivers may be too
       (Stuff gets called after _close now - unload race possibly too;
       should be fixed in test6)
     * OSS module remove races (fixed by Christoph Hellwig)
     * Merge the 2.2 ServeRAID driver into 2.4 (Christoph Hellwig)
     * AHA27xx is broken (maybe 28xx too) (reported fixed by Doug
       Ledford)
     * Merge the network fixes (DaveM)
     * Finish 64bit vfs merges (lockf64 and friends missing -- willy?)
       (Andreas Jaeger reports that lockf64 has been added for Intel and
       Alpha; other architectures may not be done, but if not, they won't
       build :-)
     * Can't compile CONFIG_IBMTR and CONFIG_PCMCIA_IBMTR in kernel at
       once; kernel link failes (rasmus; fixed in a kludgy way by not
       allowing the combination by arjan)
     * Merge the RIO driver
     * Potential deadlock in EMU10K driver when running SMP
       (orre@nada.kth.se, Alan)
       
Probably Hardware Bugs
     * Data corruption on IDE disks (Generic PCI DMA and SiS support
       Steven Walter) (sounds like PCChips #M599LMR motherboard doesn't
       disable UDMA when a non-UDMA cable is used. If you disable UDMA in
       the BIOS, then there is no problem. hardware bug?)
     * AHA29xx driver appears to stomp other cards (may be BIOS; probably
       motherboard has assigned to small of a range to a card, so that
       it's overlapping with some other card -- Doug Ledford)
     * USB hangs on APM suspend on some machines (fixed more most; Alan
       has one still that fails but the BIOS has 'issues')
