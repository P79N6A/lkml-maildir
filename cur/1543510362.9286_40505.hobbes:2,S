   I am not proposing a cappy band aid that will make mess and it will
   be hard to remove. I am _only_ tuning by hand the hash for the most
   machines that are running 2.3.18ac8 _right_now_.
Several of the core developers are running 2.3.x _right_now_ with 4mb
and 8mb of memory, therefore your changes are doubly unacceptable even
by your own arguments for it.
Later,
