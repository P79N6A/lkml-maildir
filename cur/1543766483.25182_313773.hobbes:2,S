ia32 platform:
kernel linux-2.4.25 
kernel-patch-gcov-0.5 applied
gcov configuration:
#
# GCOV coverage profiling
#
CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE=y
CONFIG_GCOV_ALL=y
CONFIG_GCOV_PROC=y
the data files are generated as expected - copied them into the kernel tree
touched all c,h files and reran make bzImage - it runs for quite some time
obviously using the .da files (for those where there are none warnings are 
issued) and then fails with the below error. 
 Can anybody suggest what could cause this error ? No make clean/distclean/mrproper or the like was run between the generation of the profiling data and the recompilation ?
init/version.c:0: warning: file init/version.da not found, execution counts assumed to be zero
