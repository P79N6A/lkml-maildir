I agree completely, for complex returns the parentheses should remain. In 
most cases it's pretty obvious that they should just go away, in the few 
cases where I'm in doubt or when the expression is clearly complex 
enough to warrent them for readabillity, I'll leave them.
That's two people agreeing (I got one reply off list that's in agreement 
as well), a few more and I'll go into patch-mania mode ;)
Thank you for commenting.
