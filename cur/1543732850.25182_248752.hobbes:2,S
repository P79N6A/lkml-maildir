Hi Andrew,
I debugged this some more. Here is whats happening:
The test program used program text address as buffer to do the READ to.
DIO get_user_pages() returned EFAULT. We called finished_one_bio()
as part of dropping the ref. to dio. It called aio_complete().
do_direct_IO() returned EFAULT to the caller. aio_run_iocb() expects
to see EIOCBQUEUED/RETRY, otherwise it calls aio_complete() with the
"ret" value. This is where the second aio_complete() is coming from.
So we cleanup "req" and on the next de-ref we get OOPS.
The problem here is, finished_one_bio() shouldn't call aio_complete()
since no work has been done. I have a fix for this - can you verify this
? I am not really comfortable with this "tweaking". (I am not really
sure about IO errors like EIO etc. - if they can lead to calling
aio_complete() twice)
Fix is to call aio_complete() ONLY if there is something to report.
Note the we don't update dio->result with any error codes from
get_user_pages(), they just passed as "ret" value from do_direct_IO().
Thanks,
Badari
