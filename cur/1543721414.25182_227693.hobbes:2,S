Not exactly: lost_count is increased for every "tick" where lost ticks are
detected, but re-set anytime there is no lost tick.

So if this heuristic works, no more ticks will be lost (at least in the near
future), so lost_count will be set to zero again. If, due to some new event,
ticks are lost again, lost_count will start at zero, reach 25 after some
time, and cpufreq_delayed_get() will be called again.
However: inaccuracies are only detected in _one_ direction: ticks being
missed, not "too many ticks" -- and only if it's a factor of two or
higher... Probably a better run-time check of the sanity of a timesource is
needed in future... on the other hand, frequencies shouldn't change behind
the kernel's back. That's what my other patch sent to the ACPI list a few
days ago (pstate_cnt) tries to address.
