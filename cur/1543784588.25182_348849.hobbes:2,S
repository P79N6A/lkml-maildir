If something like a PCI power management function fails then it will likely
cause suspend or resume to malfunction, and we have a lot of such problems.
So we-the-developers do need to hear about it when such functions fail.  So
either a) each and every driver has to blurt a printk (dumb) or b) we stick
a warning and a backtrace in the failing function (better).
