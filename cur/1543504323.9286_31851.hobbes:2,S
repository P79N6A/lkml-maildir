Chip's patch to "ext2_notify_change" also fixes another problem:
without it, "sys_truncate" and "sys_ftruncate" return EPERM if you
don't own the file you're trying to truncate.  Obviously, this
function never worked as intended; it was just luck that it was left
out of the "ext2_sops" structure before "proposed-2.2.11pre2".
Also, I see that the "ATTR_FLAG_*" code in "ext2_notify_change" is
still broken.  It needs the included patch, in addition to Chip's
patch.  Currently, "notify_change" is never called with
"ATTR_ATTR_FLAGS" set, so the patch won't have any affect, but if
you're going to include dead code, it might as well be *correct* dead
code.  Also, it might save us from some surprises down the road.
All this stuff is still broken in 2.3.12, too: "ext2_sops" has "NULL"
for the "notify_change" function and the "ext2_notify_change" is the
same old hopeless mess.  Alan, has Linus already gotten patches for
this, or does someone still need to do them (and maybe move the
non-ext2-specific RLIMIT_FSIZE checks into the generic filesystem code
while they're at it)?
