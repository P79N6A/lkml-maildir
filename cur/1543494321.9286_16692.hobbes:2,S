Actually; I believe if you use the state-flipping trick I mentioned
previously, you will have no performance issues, since the dynamic
linker will run with the pages in the writable state.  Only when
execution starts will the code pages flip into the execute state.
The downside, of course, is that you don't get the error until at
runtime, but that's the normal behaviour for illegal instructions anyway
(SIGILL).
