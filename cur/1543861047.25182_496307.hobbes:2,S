-          The User-Mode Linux port can provide support for IO Memory
-          emulation with this option.  This allows a host file to be
-          specified as an I/O region on the kernel command line. That file
-          will be mapped into UML's kernel address space where a driver can
-          locate it and do whatever it wants with the memory, including
-          providing an interface to it for UML processes to use.

-          For more information, see

-          If you'd like to be able to provide a simulated IO port space for
-          User-Mode Linux processes, say Y.  If unsure, say N.
