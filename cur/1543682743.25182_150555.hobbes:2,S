Current syslog has problems handling it. These problems are a lot worse
than they appear too. Since the file system encoding is UTF-8 for file
naming the syslog daemon is sometimes logging kernel file path objects
which are unicode utf-8 format. 
The highbit corrupted characters in the C files (as well as being iffy
C) causes problems we just don't need. 
It doens't really matter if we pick UTF-8 (which does mean things like
names can be handled ok) or plain 7bit ascii C locale but we need to
pick something.
