s/lock/reserve/.

And that's the problem.  Either we create small temporary windows, in
which case we may end up thrashing through vast numbers of them before
we find a bit that's available --- very expensive as the disk gets full
--- or we use large windows but get worse layout when there are parallel
allocators going on.
