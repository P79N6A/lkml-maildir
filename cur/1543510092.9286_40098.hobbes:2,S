Hi all !
I have a server running kernel 2.2.x. It needs iqmasquerading between eth0
and eth0:0. If the client machines running 2.0.x everything's ok. If I
change the kernel on the clients to 2.2.x then only a few packages get
through and the connection died. Tcpdump (on the server) shows that the
client keeps sending the requests but can't get through to their
destination. A little bit weird 'cause when I use 2.2.x on clients
(pc01) then in arp table appears the router's arp behind the server.
If I use 2.0.x then - properly - not. 
pc01 eth0 ---- eth0:0 server eth0 ---- router ---..

pc02 eth0 --|

pc03 eth0 --|
