Ingo,
Due to email problems, I never got your reply on this thread. But I saw
your reply when reading this thread on lkml.org (nor did I receive Linus's
first reply).
Anyway, I booted 2.6.24-rc4-mm1 with the same config, and accepted the
defaults to the new config options as the git version I checked. And it
gave me an average of 12.5 second runs.
Here's the oprofile for it:
