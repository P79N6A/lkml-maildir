Hi Linus,
A problem has been found for the XFS commit b394e43e995d08821588a22561c6a71a63b4ff27
and it needs to be reverted.
It has the potential for worse corruption than what it is meant to fix.
Please pull from the for-linus branch:
    git pull git://oss.sgi.com:8090/xfs/xfs-2.6.git for-linus
Lachlan's description:
    This fix is for a problem that has been in XFS since day one.
    [XFS] Avoid replaying inode buffer initialisation log items if on-disk version is newer.
    It tries to fix an issue where log replay is replaying an inode cluster
    initialisation transaction that should not be replayed because the inode
    cluster on disk is more up to date.  Since we don't log file sizes (we
    rely on inode flushing to get them to disk) then we can't just replay
    all the transations in the log and expect the inode to be completely
    restored.  We lose file size updates.  Unfortunately this fix is causing
    more (serious) problems than it is fixing so please don't push this one
    back just yet.
This will update the following files:
