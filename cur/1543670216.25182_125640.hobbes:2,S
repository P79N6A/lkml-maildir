I've also just installed rh9 and I'm compiling a 2.5.66 kernel right now,
so we may share experiences. This will my desktop machine, all important
stuff is done on another one but I'll try my kernel patches on it.
To avoid module-related problems and easier booting, I've left everything
I need compiled inline and turned off modules. I'm net-booting, so I'm
also compiling NFS-root and in-kernel DHCP autoconfig just in case I
need it later on.
Will keep the list informed about progress.
Greets, Antonio.
ps. what are the keyboard/mouse/monitor issues???
