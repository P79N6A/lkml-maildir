     Actually, this reminds me very much of SIGDANGER on AIX.  AIX
broadcasts SIGDANGER when paging space reaches its warning threshold,
allowing processes to handle it as they wish.  If nobody frees any memory,
and paging space reaches the kill threshold, AIX starts to send SIGKILL.
There is even a function, psdanger(), which allows programs to query
available swap and the relative proximity to either of the paging space
thresholds.
