Amazing! This patch also fixes IO-APIC problems on my EPOX 8k5a3+ (VIA KT333).
Onboard devices like usb, sound and net (via-rhine) never worked, when the 
mobo operated in APIC mode - now they do, great!
There's also a patch for 2.6 on bugzilla - see Bug #10.
So, if everyone with ACPI/IO-APIC probs with via chipsets would test this one, 
it hopefully would make it into mainstream 2.4 / 2.6  soon.
Thanks!
Christian
