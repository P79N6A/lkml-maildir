Hi Dave,
We do care for multipath cached option.  We do use it often with node
aware multipath.  We haven't experienced oopsen or crashes for our use cases
since the past year.  We will test Amit and Pekka's patch with fault injection.
We will also go through the core multipath-cached code and give a try at
cleaning it up.

Can you please point us to any open bug reports on multipath cached?  We did 
a Call for testing on netdev sometime back but did not get any bug reports.  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=114827370231872&w=2
The kernel bugzilla shows zaroo boogs for multipath cached as well.
Thanks,
Kiran
