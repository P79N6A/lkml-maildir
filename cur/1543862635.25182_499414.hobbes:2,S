This is not what I'm mostly concerned about.  The patches create a
bottleneck since _all_ processes use the same resource.  Plus, this code
has to be run on a machine with multiple processors to get RFOs into play.
So, please do this: on an SMP (4p or more) machine, rig the test so that
it runs quite a while.  Then, in a script, start the program a bunch of
times, all in parallel.  Have the script wait until all program runs are
done and time the time until the last program finishes.
