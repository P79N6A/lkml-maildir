Sorry, was late at night when we did the release - monitor.c was posted - 
and i just posted hello.c it half an hour ago :)

It doesnt matter in practice.
Also, look at our code: we buffer notification events and do not have to 
stop the thread for recording the context information.
Also, if you _do_ care about getting immediate readouts, the _monitoring_ 
task can be set to higher priority. (not that i'd advocate it in general: 
any task stopping or scheduling can destroy a workload's true behavior)

Even if the two read()s are done apart, stopping a task is _far_ more 
intrusive to the event flow of a single application. Most workloads are 
multithreaded - so stopping a task causes another task to be scheduled 
in, which would not have occured were the profiling more transparent and 
less intrusive.
Furthermore, even for the special case of single task monitoring, a 
context-switch is more expensive than a system call.
Furthermore, in most of the practical cases there's very few events 
happening between two read()s. The interval of profiling versus the 
interval between two reads()s is a couple of orders of magnitude.
This 'task has to be stopped' aspect is a red herring that has no 
technical basis.

It's possible with our code too: what you are asking for is in essence a 
sys_read_fds() system call extension - a bit like readv(), but from a 
vector of separate fds.
Such kind of 'group system call facility' has been suggested several 
times in the past - but ... never got anywhere because system calls are 
cheap enough, it really does not count in practice.
It could be implemented, and note that because our code uses a proper 
Linux file descriptor abstraction, such a sys_read_fds() facility would 
help _other_ applications as well, not just performance counters.
But it brings complications: demultiplexing of error conditions on 
individual counters is a real pain with any compound abstraction. We very 
consciously went with the 'one fd, one object, one counter' design.
