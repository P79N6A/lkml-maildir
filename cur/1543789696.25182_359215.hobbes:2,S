I have this in kthread instead, so that multithreaded userspace
processes only need to have NOFREEZE set once (before forking). Yes, I
have one that fits this scenario - I'm working on a userspace storage
maanger, which will setup and tear down a network connection at
appropriate times during a suspend-to-disk cycle. The initial version is
based on nbd and uses two threads because the one that sets up storage
blocks in a syscall as Pavel & others have written it.
Anyway, I agree that the general need you're trying to address is real.
