I think we counted them in the order of 1400 external IRQs (actual
ioapics/slots plus possible on-card bridges), and yes numbers for used
IRQs were close to 250. Actual customer configurations could've big
bigger, I don't have such data.

Yes, since x86_64 boxes never had a problem once dynamic vectors were
incorporated.
