Well the initial enthusiasm appears to have passed, and nothing
is happening.
Is there interest in getting together to resolve this issue?
I note that the next major conference appears to be
Linux Kongress (Koln/Cologne) in early September. Maybe
we can get some glibc / other-libraries people there, and
make some progress.
If there is some interest (post off-list if preferred), I'll contact the
organisers and try to get a BoF together for this.
I'll look at linux.conf.au as an additional opportunity when
time gets a bit closer.
