I'm not sure in what cases a drive will remap a sector. Manufacturers
are not publishing this.
So if you get a read-error (showing you that some of your data was just
lost!), you could just rewrite that sector and hope for the drive to
remap it. Well, you just lost some of your data. Maybe it was part of a
file you got from a CD. Fine. Easy to replace. Maybe it was part of your
CD-collection-backup. Fine. Easy to replace. Maybe it was part of your
thesis document. Oops. Difficult to replace.

Right. Support for bad sectors is really easy to build into a
filesystem. If Reiserfs doesn't (yet) support it, another reason not 
to use Reiserfs. 
You create a file called something like ".badblocks" in the root
directory. If as a filesystem you get to know of a bad block, just
allocate it towards that file. Next it pays to make the file invisble
from userspace. (otherwise "tar backups" would try to read it!). 
This is usually done by just allocating an inodenumber for it, and
telling  fsck about it, to prevent it being linked into lost+found 
on the first fsck....

On the other hand, I once bumped my knee against the bottom of the table
that my computer was on. That was the exact moment that one of my
sectors went bad. So now I know the cause, and want to remap the sector. 
No gradual decay.
