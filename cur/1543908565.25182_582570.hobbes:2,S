Some security systems that have the concept of "no default access"
(task labeled "*") also allow access by those tasks but only if there
is an explicit rule giving access to the task.  IOW, rule 6 is applied
before rule 1.  In my experience this simplifies special cases where a
task should only have access to a very small set of resources.  I'm
curious why smack goes the other way?
