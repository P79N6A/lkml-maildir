I agree.  We are not at all likely to see it in practice.  Even
if my memory is correct and vga cards and non-monochrome cga
cards supported that mode.
That doesn't mean checking for 0x00 is sufficient to detect
an initialized struct screen_info, or a lack of a video screen.
We have in kernel historical precedent for using 0x00 as just meaning
a text mode.  I'm fairly certain that I looked I more closely I could
find this convention of using 0x00 to mean a text mode on ia64, mips,
and ppc, in addition to the instances I found on alpha, arm,
Since the whole point is to detect the case where we don't have
a screen at all it makes sense to check several additional variables
and make certain that they are all 0.  Agreed?
