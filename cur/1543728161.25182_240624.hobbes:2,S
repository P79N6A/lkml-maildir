Look at lkml. For sure, you'll find a good number of examples of really
small (and not really intrusive/important/...) changes that took more
than a dozen emails to discuss (and probably to not come to an end at
all).  Right, I think distro's people should go through all that for
every single change, even while continueing to work on that. Patch
resync isn't an easy thing (even for "single" projects like the Linux
kernel) and nearly an endless game if you bring in something of the
scale of a whole distro. ...and then, there exist several of them.
So I think IFF you (as a distro) attempt to do any changes (be it adding
a well-selling feature like DVD toasting), you *will* somewhen reach a
critical mass: the point of no return (of good patches).
Seems we're slowly reaching there. (I'm just waiting to see a giant Arch
repo of a single, unified Linux distro because of that.)

What's more important to whom? First ship the feature, or first getting
consens with the initial author? Exactly--there are two answers:(
