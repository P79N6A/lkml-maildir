I was poking around replacing the boolean_t typedef in e1000, so it's nothing 
upstream. Just run `sed -i s/boolean_t/bool/g` on all the files in 
drivers/net/e1000 to see :)
the version of sparse is that in fc6, so that may be out-of-date (?).

well the sparse warning is about signedness. Either sparse needs to "know" that 
bool is unsigned, or the kernel headers need to somehow make bool unsigned... 
the latter choice would come down to just that, but it doesn't look like a good 
idea to me either somehow.
