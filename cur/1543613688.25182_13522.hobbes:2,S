Well, you explicitly _asked_ me why I had been silent on the issue. I told
you.
I also told you that I thought it wasn't that big of a deal, and that
patches already exist.
So I'm letting the patches fight it out among the people who _do_ care.
Then, eventually, I'll do something about it, when we have a winner.
If that isn't "Divide et Impera", I don't know _what_ is. Remember: the
romans didn't much care for their subjects. They just wanted the glory,
and the taxes.
