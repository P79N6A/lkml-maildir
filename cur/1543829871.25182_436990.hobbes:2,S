This all makes sense. But 64 bit and 32 bit apps should get the same
treatment right? Currently 64 bit apps get read_implies_exec with
exec_stack but 32 bit apps do not. Obviously the 64 bit behaviour is the
intended one this is clear from the comments in the code for
elf_read_implies_exec.
I don't feel very strongly about which way it is fixed. Biggest problem
is probably that developers on non NX boxes do not even see a problem if
they get the exec flag wrong.

It is the demo of the newly released game by linuxgamepublishing Gorky
17. Don't know wether it is in the full version as well but it seems
likely.
Anyway I care more about the kernel getting fixed.
I guess I can put a personality wrapper in place to force
read_implies_exec for individual apps anyway.
