And glory, glory, my Acer Aspire 1520 (1524) AMD64 notebook with the
old vt8235 chipset got a good kick in the behind as well. I didn't
even enable anything hpet related in the .config:
root@sleipner:~# grep -i hpet /var/log/kern.log
Sep  2 05:36:59 sleipner kernel: Force enabled HPET at base address

Sep  2 05:36:59 sleipner kernel: hpet clockevent registered

For the benefit of Andreas Mohr (and other interested parties) I now
follow the instructions in "HPET force-enable investigations on Via
VT8235 (was: Re: extra"
