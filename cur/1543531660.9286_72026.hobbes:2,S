	I've noticed this problem on my network. I'm behind an Ascend
pipeline 50. I had thought that this might be the root of the problem.
Supposedly there's something similar reported as a problem with older
ascend software.
	Any idea what the other people experiencing the prolbem are using
as gateway routers?
