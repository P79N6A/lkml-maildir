cool.  I had support for this in the mega-patch I posted long ago, but
I never seperated and submitted those changes 'cause I'm a moron.

careful.  you just used the indirect ac97 registers without holding the
card's lock..  if another processor does a mixer ioctl while this is
happening you'll get weird behaviour.
it looks like you should just be able to spin_{,un}lock(card->lock)
around that call, but the maestro locking is so friggin' twisty.. this
gets even more exciting when the driver uses ac97_codec, which the
mega-patch also had in it.
Fix the locking (and the obscure parameter name? :)) and it looks
fine.. good work.
