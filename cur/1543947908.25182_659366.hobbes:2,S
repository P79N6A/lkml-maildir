Would it make more sense to have a generic cgroups boot option for this?
Something like cgroup_disable=xxx, which would be parsed by cgroups
and would cause:
- a "disabled" flag to be set to true in the subsys object (you could
use this in place of the mem_cgroup_on flag)
- prevent the disabled cgroup from being bound to any mounted
hierarchy (so it would be ignored in a mount with no subsystem
options, and a mount with options that specifically pick that
subsystem would give an error)
