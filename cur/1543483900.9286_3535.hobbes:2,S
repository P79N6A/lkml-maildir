I haven't found anything.  
* The mixer works for Loudness/Enhance/Mute but seemingly nothing
  else.
* Changing default_levels in pas2_mixer.c registers in xmixer and
  other mixer programs, but the actual sound volume is not changed.
  Changing volume in the mixer seems to call all the proper functions
  as far as I can tell/gr0k.
* The 2.0.36 driver doesn't compile for 2.2.1 out of the box (duh).
* I tried diff'ing pas2_mixer.c with the 2.0.36 one but most of the
  changes are whitespace and I don't understand anything in the rest.
  (If I get bored, I'll eventually try to back out the recent mixer
  changes and see what happens.)
* On the bright side, the commercial driver from www.opensound.com
  works (note: It also initialises the sound card to a much more
  acceptable volume than the free driver.  So you can use it to
  initialise the card and then continue using the free driver,
  although the mixer will still not work and this use is probably
  infringing the OSS evaluation license.)
Navin.
PS Sorry, but I'm Cc'ing this to the list as your email and another
   one makes it clearer that this is not only an isolated problem with
   my own system/setup.
