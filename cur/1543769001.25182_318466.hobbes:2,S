A simple server-side CGI would be a "send me all changeset SHA-1s,
starting at HEAD until you reach FOO" operation (FOO being the SHA1 of
the previous head you've pulled before). This operation is simple enough
that it people should have no problem installing such a CGI.
You could then stream-pull the actual contents over HTTP/1.1 without
further CGI interaction.
