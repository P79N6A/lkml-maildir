Hi!

Looks mostly okay, few nits...

Could we make it SNAPSHOT_IOC_FREEZE or even better SNAPSHOT_FREEZE?

Is this still true?

Nice.

Is this good idea? It will overflow on 32-bit systems. Ammount of
available swap can be >4GB. [Or maybe it is in something else than
bytes, then you need to specify it.]

Parse error on last sentence.
"because the code to set the resume partition could be removed from
future kernels"?

We should specify that userland suspend/resume utilities should lock
themselves in memory before freezing system, and not attempt
filesystem operations after freeze. (Probably not even reads).
We may want to specify if it is okay to snapshot system and then
unfreeze and continue. I'd suggest supporting that -- it will be handy
for "esc to abort" and "suspend to RAM and disk".
Ouch and you have my ACK on next attempt :-).
