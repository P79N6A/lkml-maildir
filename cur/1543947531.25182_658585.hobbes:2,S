Can't get_personality() mean getting the personality of current task?
Or you want a more generic macro like this?
#define get_task_personality(tsk) ((tsk)->personality)
No, that is _too_ generic. Look at the code, (nearly) all references to
'personality' are via 'current'. So get_personality() is enough.
I am not a fan of C++, I know that sometimes the get/set method in C++
is really a bit pointless, but, of course, *not* all the times.
