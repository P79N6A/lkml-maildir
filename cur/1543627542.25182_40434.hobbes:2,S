You umount the file system (that is the best you can do with a random
error anyways, BSD doesn't do any better except in the special case
of lost blocks in the bitmap) and fsck it again on the real volume.
In theory you could build a mechanism to pass some state from the 
first fsck to the second to speed the second up, but it is probably not 
worth it.
