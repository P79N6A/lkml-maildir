Hello everybody,
I am building up a library using xmm and mmx registers in Linux environment.
At the begin of this activity I was given a sample routine,  which contains
a line
.align   16
in a text segment.
As far as I can understand the line of the sort does not have any sense and
GCC-compiler must ignore it. Nevertheless I noticed by running test programs
that unpredictably some times the line does impact on execution time,
sometimes it does not.
Any explanation ?
Thanks, Lev
