What is "System Time" here? Does in include CPU consumption by, say,
kswapd? If not, then one may conjecture that mark_page_accessed batching
modifies ordering of pages on zone "LRU" lists in a way that measurably
changes efficiency of VM scanning, and mostly affects process that scans
most---kswapd.
