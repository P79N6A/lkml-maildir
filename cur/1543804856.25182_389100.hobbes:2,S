While ripping this out may break things, leaving it in has
been breaking things as well. That line just keeps growing.
Many times, I have found that my buffer was too small to
read that file. (shall I make it a megabyte or what?)
Looking around a bit, I can only find use of the first number.
(so don't remove that)
I suggest removing the excess values for all architectures.
It's in /proc/interrupts anyway.
If some architectures will keep the data, then please limit
the data to the original 16 PC-AT interrupts and #if it like so:
#if defined(CONFIG_X86) && defined(CONFIG_ISA)
        for (i = 0; i < 16; i++)  /* only the 16 legacy ones */
                seq_printf(p, " %u", kstat_irqs(i));
#endif
Those 16 are the only ones you can hope to identify
without looking in /proc/interrupts anyway.
