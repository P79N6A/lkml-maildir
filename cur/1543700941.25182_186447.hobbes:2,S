Ack, just noticed that. I haven't seen famd messing with audio CDs, but 
also Joshua said that he didn't have famd installed on his machine, so 
that cuts that out. Strange how he said that eject(1) worked. Not sure, 
but just to reiterate to people though if you have mounted removable 
media it might not eject if you have famd installed on your machine, not 
sure if nautilus has been updated to drop its proxied dnotify when they 
are umounted.
