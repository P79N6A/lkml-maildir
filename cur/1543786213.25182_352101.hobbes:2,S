I have the exact same problem on a ASUS A8N-SLI Premium board and 
Athlon64 4800+ X2 with every BIOS up to 1008-01.  Running with notsc is 
the only way to get it to work.
As an aside BIOS version 1008-003 is available for this board however 
this one seems to be WAY worse as the board won't even boot.  It gets 
panics before the boot messages unless you boot with noapic and after 
that it gets checksum errors on the RSDP.  I'm afraid to see what the 
next official BIOS version does. :/
