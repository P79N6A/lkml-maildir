Thanks for the reply Alan,
I think I see what you mean.  The ldisc write_chan code is actually
invoked from the terminal process and if this is I/O blocked then the
terminal process cannot invoke release_dev().  So why did I experience
calls to hvc_write() after the final open instance was closed with
release_dev()?

In hvc_console we don't have a serial side, but I do have the device
side which will invoke a tty_hangup() if an hvc adapter was hotplug
removed.  This doesn't happen for the actual console adapter (hvc0)
because it isn't allowed in firmware.
So my strategy for now is going to be to get rid of the tty->driver_data
= NULL in hvc_close() and simply check the open count in hvc_hangup()
and hvc_write() to verify that these operations are actually relevant.
thanks again Alan,
