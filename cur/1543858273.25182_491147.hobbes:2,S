Sorry, I should have clarified this earlier--the Quantum GoVault is a
removable disk drive, not a CD-ROM.  The device is reminiscent of Zip
disks, but the cartridge is a sealed unit and contains a 2.5" SATA disk
inside; hence it's not a CD-ROM.  So the patch below won't work for me,
because sdev->type == TYPE_DISK.
I wonder if the same sort of REPORT LUNS screw-up might apply to other
ATAPI devices too, such as tape drives.  Since we've seen that
manufacturers of CD-ROMs and removable disks don't implement it, it
would not surprise me if the other ATAPI devices don't either.  But,
that's speculation on my part.
