The file drivers/perfctr/version.h is missing, apparently due
to an incomplete merge of the external perfctr package. This
will result in the compilation errors you quoted.
Look at the top of drivers/perfctr/RELEASE-NOTES and you'll see
which version of perfctr OSDL is using, get the corresponding
tarball from 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/,
 and
copy its linux/drivers/perfctr/version.h into your kernel.
You should also file a bug report with the OSDL people.
