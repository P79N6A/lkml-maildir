OK. I *have* to ask.. ;)
What's the *second* most advanced configfs-enabled storage engine?
The only in-tree users of configfs I could find (grepping for the string
'config_item_init') were drivers/net/netconsole, fs/ocfs2, and fs/dlm, so
"most advanced configfs" is well into "world's tallest midget" territory...
