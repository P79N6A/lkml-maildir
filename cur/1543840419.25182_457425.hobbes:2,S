Hi,
I was just trying to reproduce that 'register_one_node'
build error (and couldn't even with the supplied .config file;
weird).  Anyway, after I enabled CONFIG_NUMA (but not CONFIG_ACPI),
I got the following error message.  Seems that some config
options should prevent this config from even being possible
to create.  Any ideas or suggestions?
This is still on 2.6.18-rc4-git1.
