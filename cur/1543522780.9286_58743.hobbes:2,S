Yes, yes! It's worth it! That one extra "write" will take a seek, and
a write. Say 20ms total (Provided the disk is turning). I find that an
acceptable "price" to pay if I haven't written to a filesystem for say
a minute. (*) But if that's "too close" for you, feel free to set the
default timeout at half an hour.
I have a computer with 21G of "dead" harddisks. They would be nice to
have mounted, but I'm currently working on projects (driver
development) that crash the machine regularly, so I have to keep the
fstab from mounting them, otherwise I'd "dirty" them way too often...

(*) Moreover, it is highly likely that I'm writing to a mounted
filesystem. The system knows five to thirty seconds before the actual
first write that dirty buffers for that disk exist!
