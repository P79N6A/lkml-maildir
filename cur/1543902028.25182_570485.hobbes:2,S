OK, thanks.

Yes, but having the "pid == &init_struct_pid" in free_pid() is imho worse,

Wouldn't it better if copy_process()'s error path does
	if (pid != &init_struct_pid)
		free_pid(pid);
instead? OK, "cleaner" is a matter of taste, but from the perfomance POV
this would be better, even if not noticable.
