Actually - not. CONFIG_USB_HID enables or disables the hid.o module, and
has three states - Y, N, M. The HIDINPUT/HIDDEV are just options for
that module, enabling/disabling some of its functionality, having only Y
and N states.
So it's quite straightforward. And there are 7 useful combinations,
out of 9 possible.
And in your suggested case, you would either have to make
HIDDEV/HIDINPUT tristate, resulting in illegal combinations of Y+M, or
you wouldn't be able to express that the driver should be built as a
module.
