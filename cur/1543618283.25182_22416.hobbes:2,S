I've been getting many errors due to timeouts, everything was fine while
I was at home, but here at school it's a major problem:

Jan 22 18:10:34 bouncybouncy kernel: eth0: reset did not complete in 10
ms.
once it complains about that, it stops working until I reboot.
It seems to happen everytime a large transer is done.(apt-get updgrade
-d the last 3 times.)
Is this a problem with me, or are the hubs screwy?  The hubs I'm on are
"smart hubs", lets just say they aren't too bright:)
I have a soyo k7vdragon+ using 2.4.17:
eth0: VIA VT6102 Rhine-II at 0xe800, 00:50:2c:01:64:a9, IRQ 11.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x782d advertising 01e1 Link
0021.
