Attempting to run pppd causes a cold boot in version 2.3.22 leaving no
useful information in the log file.

Oct 17 09:28:36 Quarto syslogd 1.3-3: restart.
There is a great flurry of info too fast to read just before the reboot
but it is clearly not logged.
This may have been true in 2.3.21 since I never got it to compile.
I haven't tried this again since it is a slow reboot with all file systems
fsck'ed.
