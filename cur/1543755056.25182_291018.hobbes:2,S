I said "configure the restrictions dynamically" but I meant "doesn't
need a recompile to change settings".  I expect the umask to be
specified in /etc/fstab and rarely changed in a running system.  With
that in mind I think the patch is useful as-is, especially because it's
so small.  But I agree, that thing is a dirty hack. :]

Aww, that sounds expensive.  My favourite solution would be to only 
allow the umask to be changed at mount time, not when remounting.
Calling parse_options from proc_fill_super, only and not from 
proc_remount does not help very much because proc_fill_super is only 
called at boot (or proc module load time).  Is there another way?
While we are here: how would one change the uid or gid parameter? With a 
built-in proc fs the mount -a -t proc in the init scripts only results 
in a proc_remount call which (in mainline) doesn't bother looking at 
parameters at all.  The same is true for a unmount, mount sequence.
Thanks,
Rene
