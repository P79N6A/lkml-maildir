Good design can avoid these problems.  If it isn't obvious what a lock 
protects, you should rethink your locking structure.

I wasn't arguing that 16 way SMP is OK.  Everyone knows it isn't.
Are you saying that clusters of small SMP machines are better?  So the locking 
moves from the kernels to the application layer.  You still have the same 
synchronization concerns, it's just a matter of what layer they are 
implemented at.
