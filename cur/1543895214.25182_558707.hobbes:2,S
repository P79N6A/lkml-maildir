Perhaps make lists of
  - bug reports which never lead to any debug activity
    (no responsible person/team was found, or a seemingly person/team
    did not start to debug the report)
  - known regressions on release,
  - regressions that became known after release,
  - subsystems with notable backlogs of old bugs,
  - other categories?
Select typical cases from each categories, analyze what went wrong in
these cases, and try to identify practicable countermeasures.
Another approach:  Figure out areas where quality is exemplary and try
to draw conclusions for areas where quality is lacking.
