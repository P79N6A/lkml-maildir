Actually, use "git diff -M --stat --summary master..for-linus".
The "--summary" thing generates an additional summary at the end of the 
diffstat that lists deleted/created/moved/copied files, which is nice to 
see. There's a difference between a
   drivers/char/myserial.c  | 50 ++++++++
   1 file changed, 50 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
and
   drivers/char/myserial.c  | 50 ++++++++
   1 file changed, 50 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
   create mode 100644 drivers/char/myserial.c
because the latter tells that the new lines are actually in a new file, 
while the previous says that you just added lines to an old one.
(Without "--summary", you can't tell the difference between these two 
cases)
And the "-M" flag obviously means the difference between:
 drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h          |  236 ----------------------
 include/linux/pci_hotplug.h                |  236 ++++++++++++++++++++++

 delete mode 100644 drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h
 create mode 100644 include/linux/pci_hotplug.h
and
 .../pci/hotplug => include/linux}/pci_hotplug.h    |    2 +-
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
 rename drivers/pci/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h => include/linux/pci_hotplug.h (99%)
where the latter version clearly tells you a whole lot more about the 
patch than the non-renaming one.
The reason rename detection isn't on by default is that non-git tools 
don't understand the rename diffs. But if anybody sends me patches, please 
feel free to use "git diff -M" to make them smaller and more readable in 
the face of renames.
