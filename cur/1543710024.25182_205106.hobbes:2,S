Subject: AW: Kernel 2.6.3 patch for Intel Compiler 8.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I used the patch to compile two identical kernels with gcc 3.3.3 and
icc 8.0 with oprofile support built in.
The optimization switches were chosen quite conservative, i.e.
"-O2 -Ob1", no IPO, and of course: no MMX, SSE, and SSE2 stuff inside
the kernel (thus disabling Intel's great vectorizer).
Profiling: lmbench ran ten times but time measurements were taken from
oprofile (on Pentium 4, GLOBAL_POWER_EVENTS in kernel space only, 
counter overflow: 3.000).
Results: 33% of the lmbench procs faster on icc, 66% faster on gcc.
Thus, take the kernel patch as a good basis for modifying the 
compiler switches and other things to get more performance gains. As
I know, a lot of people are looking for a patch.
Please check the patch file; you have to modify a lot of things in 2.6.3
to create a quite stable working version of the kernel. The patch is not
just about changing some minor Makefile things...
Kind rgs., Ingo.

Speed improvements over same kernel compiled with gcc?
Thanks,
