Are you guys trying to target the highest or lowest common denominator
here? Because the more of this thread I read the more of the population
you guys are excluding.
(Oh but I have my 2 friends have 5 dvd players, 3 cdrws, 4 zip drives,
7 ls-120's and a partridge in their pc and as such I must conclude that
the vast majority of the world does also).
