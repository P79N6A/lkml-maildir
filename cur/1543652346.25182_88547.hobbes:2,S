Yes, that is rather generic -- somewhat like a variable-sized ramdisk.  
I think the key difference is that the ramdisk wants to hold blobs of
data that will be accessed from user-mode by read & write.
A "blob of bytes" for kexec, and maybe for a few other uses, wants to be
accessed (perhaps a page at a time) by pointers while in kernel space.
I'm not so sure of the generality, though.  It's my guess that there
many special-case requirements that might make it difficult to become
useful infrastructure (eg, maybe the DSP on a soundcard needs it to be
4M aligned and contiguous, or the texture memory for the video card
wants to be able to walk a data structure that only it knows about).
