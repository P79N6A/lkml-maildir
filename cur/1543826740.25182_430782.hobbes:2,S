I don't see how driver matching will help here. It seems wrong to
enable a device first, and then check if the resources it is
decoding actually conflict with some other device's resources.
Regarding quirks, all the ones that mess around with resources
are marked as HEADER quirks. So they should be called right
after a device is probed and before its driver can call
pci_request_regions(). What problems do you see if regions are
requested before the device is enabled?
