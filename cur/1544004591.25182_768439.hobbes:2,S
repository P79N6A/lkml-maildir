[
  As Andrew pointed out, the previous version had a lot of ugly
  #ifdefs. This patch removes them and just does the check at
  the resize. It also hides the max latency recording functions
  behind the config option.
  The git tree now has this version instead.

Ingo,
The following patches are against mainline, and need to go in 2.6.28:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-2.6-trace.git

      ftrace: do not update max buffer with no users
