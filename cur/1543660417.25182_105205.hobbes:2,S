> When I originally wrote the patches implementing the in-kernel topology macros, they were meant to be called as a second layer of functions, sans underbars.  This additional layer was deemed unnecessary and summarily dropped.  As such, carrying around (and typing!) all these extra underbars is quite pointless.  Here's a patch to nip this in the (sorta) bud.  The macros only appear in 16 files so far, most of them being the definitions themselves.
Whee! much cleaner ;-) Very cool.
