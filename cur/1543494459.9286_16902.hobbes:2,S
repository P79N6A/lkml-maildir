This whole thread has a distinct ring to it, since NT can't boast speed or
reliability the numbers have moved to "scaling". They show nice graphs
that show speed improvement when you stick more processors into a system,
but no actual speed tests.  NT's increased latency should make it easier
for speed to improve with multiple processors.  So technically he is right
it scales more.
It reminds me of an MS supporter who once told me the only reason Linux
was the only OS running at a descent speed on my system was because my
system was too slow.
I've seen the odd real point in these types of reports from the
NT camp.  I don't think we need to wait for them to remove the plank from
their eye before we remove our slivers. ;)

As a computer I find your faith in technology amusing.
