I think that is actually a very minor bug you've found.  If someone
were posting a work request at the same time as they transitioned a QP
to reset (which is a legitimate if not sensible thing to do), then the
spinlock could get reinitialized while it was held.  Which would be
bad.  So I think I like your original patch the best.
