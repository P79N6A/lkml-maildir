Please try to declare u64 timestamp_ns, then copy it into the *ev
instead of copying whole *ev. This ought to fix the problem if
buffer[] ends aligned to 32 bits or better.
Also... Since Linus does not take patches in general off l-k anymore,
you have to find whoever herds the connector and feed the patch through
him/her.
