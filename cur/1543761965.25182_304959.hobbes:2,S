The page contains the data part of the skbuff, so I guess it is used by 
a slab.
Isn't this the idea of mapcount? to keep count of number of mapping to a 
page, and free the page only when this ref-count reaches zero??
I don't mind the slab being freed and the page not. My application won't 
access that page until the net-driver allocates a buffer on this page and 
I receive its pointer.
Will this page be used again, if I keep a mapping to it?
I don't see any reasons not to.
