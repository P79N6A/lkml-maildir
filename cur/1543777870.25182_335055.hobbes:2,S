I've seen some massive latencies on mainline when throwing network loads from 
outside, but with my limited knowledge I haven't found a way to implement 
such a thing locally. I'll look at this gnutella test at some stage to see 
what it is and if I can adopt the load within interbench. Thanks for the 
suggestion.
Cheers,
