You've already been told that syscalls are very fast.  For any small
number of calls the overhead is neglectable.  Only for possibly huge
numbers of calls (like those needed to transfer memory content) is the
overhead significant but that is irrelevant because of /proc/*/mem.
Whatever other problems you have (accessing multiple registers) is an
arch-specific problem.  If this is a real problem talk to the arch
maintainer about adding a call to get all registers at once.  This is
nothing which should be handled with a construct like hte
PTRACE_MULTI.
