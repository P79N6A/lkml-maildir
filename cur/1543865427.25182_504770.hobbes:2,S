I forgot to tell about the important part for GIT users. As Greg KH
recommended to me when I opened the 2.4-stable branch, I have created
separate trees for 2.4.33.y and 2.4.34.y. In order to make it easier
for people (and possibly automated scripts) to find those trees, Greg
and Chris accepted that I stored these trees close to theirs, in the
/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable directory.
Unless someone stops me with a good reason (which I doubt), I will
soon remove the old 2.4-stable tree in my own GIT directory to
avoid confusing duplicates and to save disk space. However, standard
2.4 will stay there of course.
Regards,
Willy
