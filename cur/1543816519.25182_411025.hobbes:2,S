Oh, I'm not exactly a fan of verbosity myself (essentially for the
lines too long and hard to read), which is why I suggested __labi_ as
a prefix --I wasn't arguing in favour of __linux_abi_.
However, as far as I know all programmer-friendly editors have some
form of easy to use code-completion feature (e.g. in vim ctrl+n/ctrl+p
are very handy without the need to define specific shortcuts, and the
new completion code in the future vim 7 is extremely promising ...)
and while I do agree that __linux_abi_ is too long, you remarked
yourself __[ukl]abi_ is still annoying, albeit shorter :) *Any* prefix
chosen will benefit from completion ;)
