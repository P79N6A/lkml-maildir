Yes, please put a current driver in, I can't seem to get tulip.c before
0.89H to work on Linksys LNE100TX cards (LC82C169 chip).  I copy v0.90
into the tree and use it as a module, and everything works fine.  Only
thing I get during compile time is a warning about suggesting braces to
fix an ambiguous else.  
Stuff you probably want to know:
gcc version egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release)
GNU ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1.0.16)
System is P200 128MB EDO 
Thanks.
