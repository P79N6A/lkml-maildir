Well, thanks to the generosity of Google, I too now have a SATA device.
What I find is that your patches work perfectly for a directly attached
SATA device.  However, they don't seem to work at all for a SATA device
attached to an expander.  It looks like the SATA expander discovery
process isn't working correctly (it also looks like the expander I have
has to be specially programmed ... the SATA device shows a flashing
orange light until the fusion sas card discovers it; with aic94xx it
always shows a flashing orange light, even after discovery).
I'll try to find time next week to dig into the discovery process.
