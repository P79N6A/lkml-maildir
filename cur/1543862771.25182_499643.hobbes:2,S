I agree the overlap issue is a problem and I hope it can be addressed 
somehow for the rare cases in which such nesting takes place.
One easy solution may be to check the dirty ratio before engaging in 
reclaim. If the dirty ratio is sufficiently high then trigger writeout via 
pdflush (we already wakeup pdflush while scanning and you already noted 
that pdflush writeout is not occurring within the context of the current 
cpuset) and pass over any dirty pages during LRU scans until some pages 
have been cleaned up.
This means we allow allocation of additional kernel memory outside of the 
cpuset while triggering writeout of inodes that have pages on the nodes 
of the cpuset. The memory directly used by the application is still 
limited. Just the temporary information needed for writeback is allocated 
outside.
Well sounds somehow still like a hack. Any other ideas out there?
