At first guess I'd suspect MTU Path discovery doesn't work. This is a
mechanism used by many systems to optimize the size of transmitted TCP
packets to avoid fragmentation. (The website sends big packets with "do not
fragment" flag and reduces packet size if it receives ICMP unreachable:
"need fragment" errors back). 
In my experience this is most often caused by misconfiguration at the
"other end" of your connection. meaning: nothing much you can do about it;
some sysadmin has set up a firewall between you and the webserver which
doesn't allow the ICMP unreachable messages to reach the webserver.
Only thing you can do is a) set your MRU to 1500 so the problem doesn't
occur or b) contact affected websites on a case by case basis and get them
to fix their setup by EITHER alloing ICMP unreachable packets to reach
their webserver OR turning off MTU Path discovery on the websever (for
linux it's a compile-time option of the kernel).
Bye, Martin
