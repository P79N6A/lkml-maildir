Hi,
after detecting problems with the do_gettimeofday() function in
my interrupt handler on a 486 (no TSC), where sometimes this
functions returns a value in the past, the following patch made
it work again, it is against 2.4.3.
I noticed that the added outb_p() line is in for mips architechture
and in kernels 2.2 for i386, but not in any 2.4. Was it removed by
purpose ?
