Hi, all...
[I'm sending this both to lkml and distro support, beacause I am not sure who
is to blame...]
Well, fast synopsys: iniscripts use /sbin/ip from iproute2-2.2.4. That needs:
CONFIG_NETLINK=y
CONFIG_RTNETLINK=y
to work. If I enable that, pump breaks (I have to try with another dhcp client...)
So I can not enable correctly bot 'lo' and 'eth0' (with dhcp via cable modem) at
the same time.
????
Thanks, let's hope this rings any bell...
