From the POV of dentry_stat.nr_unused.  From the slab POV, dentry_stat.nr_dentry
always equals the number of objects used as reported in /proc/slabinfo.  If I
could remember my stats from ages back I could take a stab at estimating the
fragmentation...  From experience if you look at memory_pressure before and 
after a shrink of the dcache you will usually see it decrease if there if
there is more that 75% or so free reported by dentry_stat.nr_unused.  
The inode cache is not as good.  With fewer inodes per page (slab) I 
would expect that percentage to be lower.  Instead it usually has to be
above 80% to get pages free...
I am trying your change now.
