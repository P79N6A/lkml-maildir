Take a look at wakeup_kswapd() for yourself ;).
No need to speculate.
Do you recall why you posted this patch?  The
wording made it sound like you had hit some
problem with waking up kswapd for all the nodes.
If you really saw that, then it would seem that
we still have a problem, that is now lacking a fix.
