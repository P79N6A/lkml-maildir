Yeah, I don't think EXPERIMENTAL makes sense here. Either you need the
PWM or you don't.

I've turned it into ARCH_AT91. I think listing the specific chips that
have it is a bit too much; it won't break if you enable it on a chip
that doesn't have it, it will just be useless. That's what defconfigs
are for, and we still want people that test allmodconfigs on e.g.
AT91RM9200 to report any breakage.
Patch below.
