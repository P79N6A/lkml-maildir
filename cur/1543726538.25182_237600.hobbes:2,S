This happened to me, also twice necessitating a reboot.  I am pretty
sure I did *not* hit Num Lock last, though the system was under load -
multiple builds going on, jackd running, and video playback.  I tried to
toggle Num Lock to see if the machine was really locked hard, and it
worked for a while (though it did not go on/off exactly once for each
time I hit it), then stopped responding.
This happened with the timer + soundcard IRQs direct, and with timer +
soundcard + RTC direct.
