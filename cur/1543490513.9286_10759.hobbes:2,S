I can see how one can make a good argument against \r\n as a line terminator
(the only argument I see *for* it are that it's the way lines are terminated
in most, if not all, line-oriented internet protocols, such as FTP, SMTP,
POP, NNTP, and HTTP, which was probably not a consideration with CP/M), but
what's the argument against \r alone?  I see no logical reason to prefer \n
over \r other than Unix is older than Mac and so it would have been nice for
Apple to have picked \n for compatibility (since I can see no reason to
prefer \r over \n).
