"If" bit can be safely snipped. linuxconf is a pile of junk and relying
on it for anything other than eventual fsckup is insanity. Sad that it has
"linux" in name...

== ide-disk is not in the kernel, even if you have it as module it's
unlikely to do you any good since you have no filesystems mounted, so
there's nowhere to fetch the module from and ...

	... you are unlikely to do it anyway, since your root filesystem
is on IDE disk and chances to read anything from there without ide-disk
are, erm, not too exciting.

	WTF were you thinking about when you placed the driver of IDE
disks into module living on IDE disk? Think a bit - how it was supposed
to be loaded, by magic?
	Send linuxconf to the place where the sun never shines and read
/usr/src/linux/README.
