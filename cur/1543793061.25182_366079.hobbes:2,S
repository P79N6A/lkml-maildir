int 0x80 can be called from long mode too. We especially kept 
this option to allow JITs like valgrind to run a 32bit process in a 64bit
image. In this case we shouldn't leak kernel registers.
You're right they normally shouldn't be leaked anyways because the
C ABI will save/restore it. I will think about it.

Can you please resubmit that as a separate patch?
