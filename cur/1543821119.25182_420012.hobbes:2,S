Subject: [patch 2.6.17-rc3] i386: fix broken FP exception handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/29/61

The FXSAVE information leak patch introduced a bug in FP exception
handling: it clears FP exceptions only when there are already
none outstanding.  Mikael Pettersson reported that causes problems
with the Erlang runtime and has tested this fix.
