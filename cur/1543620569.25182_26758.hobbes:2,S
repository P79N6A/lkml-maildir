What about distributors ?  These user space daemons and device ownership
changes can be done by the installation process of any given distro.  I
know Mandrake allows users to choose their "security level" from
install.  The options range from "Welcome to crackers" to "Paranoid". 
I'm certain that distros could perform the proper steps upon detection
of, say, a RNG.
