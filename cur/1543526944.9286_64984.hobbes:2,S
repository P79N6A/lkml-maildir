Hi Greg,
Hm.. Very interersting reading...
I've looked into the USB code and find it well commented, so it could be usefull too..
Just to make the problem / question more simple...
Is it just me or is it hard to do this? Hihihi :-)
A shortened version.....
Lets say something writes this string to my driver "/dev/ci-v" 
"satRadioA: 00314212 USB 29.850000"
and the driver reformats it into the CI-V format.
How much would it take for me to configure, lets say "/dev/ttyS0" to 1200 baud, no parity, 8 bits, 1 stopbit and raw mode,
and put the reformated data on that port?
Or am I (as it could be, and pointed out in your reply) heading totally in the wrong direction with this?
Man,this is tough! Hoho :-)
Thanks!

Ok, let me see if I understand what you are trying to do:
+----------+      +-------------+      +------------+      +-------------+      +-------+
| SatTrack | <--> | your driver | <--> | tty driver | <--> | serial port | <--> | radio |
+----------+      +-------------+      +------------+      +-------------+      +-------+
Is this correct?
If so, and you REALLY want to write a driver, you might want to try:
+----------+      +-------------+      +-------------+      +-------+
| SatTrack | <--> | your driver | <--> | serial port | <--> | radio |
+----------+      +-------------+      +-------------+      +-------+
and have your driver take over the serial port logic.
Now that would involve a lot of duplication of the serial tty driver in
your driver, but would allow you to write a driver that should do what
you need.
But you could just do the following, if you want to stay out of kernel
space:
+----------+      +--------------+      +------------+      +-------------+      +-------+
| SatTrack | <--> | your program | <--> | tty driver | <--> | serial port | <--> | radio |
+----------+      +--------------+      +------------+      +-------------+      +-------+
And have all of your formatting logic live in a user program which just
reads the data from the file that the SatTrack program is outputting and
spits out the correct serial commands to the serial driver.
Does this sound like what you want to do?

Your driver can implement the tty interface, looking like a tty device
to userspace. For instance, the usb-serial driver looks like a tty
device to all user programs that interface to it, but it spits out and
talks USB out through kernel space. The usb-serial driver implements a
tty driver interface.
Take a look at include/linux/tty_driver.h for more description of what a
tty driver needs in order to hook up to the tty system.
Hope this helps, and if you have anymore questions, please feel free to
ask.
