I have complained about breaking existing programs many times, but in 
this case I think the default should be no exec on all user writable 
data, and let the admin relax the security as needed. Or at least make a 
really obnoxious whine default, so people will know they have to deal 
with what's coming in some (near) future release.
And this should be noted at the top of the ChangeLog for versions where 
it changes, please! This will bite people, I just think it's needed to 
keep Linux the most secure o/s around. Yes, I know about openBSD...
