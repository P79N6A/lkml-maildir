Hi all.
I compile the kernel 2.1.99 with the ipv6.o
module.(I digit "make modules; make modules_install") .
I replace ipv6.o with another module,
rou_ipv6.o by Lancaster University and I call it in ipv6.o.
Now I reboot the system and I digit "depmod -a "
and the machine respose me with this message
"can't handle sections of type 553648128".
Can someone help me?
Thanks Luca.
