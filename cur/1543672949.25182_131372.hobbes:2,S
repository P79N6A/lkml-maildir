That's completely irrelevant to my point.  Whether MAP_32BIT actually
has a 31 bit limit or not doesn't matter, it's limited as well in the
possible mmap blocks it can return.
The only thing I care about is to have a hint and not a fixed
requirement for mmap().  All your proposals completely ignored this.
