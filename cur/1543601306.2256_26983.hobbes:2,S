Subject: [PATCH]: PCnet/HOME media type
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I recently had the misfortune of having to use a one of those
PCnet/HOME RJ11 networking devices, and I noticed that the pcnet32
driver in 2.4.9 wasn't setting the media type for that device.
(Actually, it appeared to be moved within an #if 0, so all I really had
to do was move it back out). For some reason the default type on my
device was to use 10BaseT (0x8000), and not the HomePNA (0x8001).
Also, the tech docs for the PCnet/Home say it uses a 79c971 core, so I
was wondering if the flags for the 79c971 should be set for it as well.
Since it worked for me either way, I just left the new flags commented
in this patch.
