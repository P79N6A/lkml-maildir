Recompile iptables against your new kernel.
A major NAT patch (newnat) went into 2.4.20 which changed a lot of
structures. A recompile against a >= 2.4.20 kernel will get it working
again.
I suggest that you post further mail about iptables-problems to
netfilter@lists.netfilter.org as that's where you are most likely to get
help.
