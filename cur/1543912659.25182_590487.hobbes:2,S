Well, between the time jump and the rpc debugging output, you've got
some great clues there--given some time I'm sure it would be possible to
completely figure out what's going on.
Unfortunately the people with the most knowledge of the code probably
don't have the time to fix problems on old kernels, so unless somebody
else recognizes the problem immediately, I'm not sure what to suggest.
Obviously, a wholesale upgrade to a more recent kernel would be the one
sure bet....

I suspect it's a lost cause.  A lot has happened in the last couple
years.
