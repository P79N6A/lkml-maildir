Ah. Shame on me. Of course, I noticed these 2 correct_wcount's, but
didn't realize we can safely use "inode" after fput(). Not only the
caller should have a reference, vma_merge() requires that vm_file == file,
so fput(file) can't destroy the last reference.

Thanks Hugh, I'll redo this cleanup.
Oleg.
