InfiniBand specifications provides tools to implement QoS.
Service Level (SL) and Virtual Lane (VL) managed by the SM determines how
the SL->VL mapping is performed these attributes are carried in the local
routing headers when a node sources the packet to the fabric.
The SL is not modified when the packet crosses subnets. IB spec has more
details on how these could be used. There is a separate congestion control
work group in IBTA that is trying to address these issue, but i have not see
that very active. Possibly since the update to 1.0a is due in very short
time.

My interest is in the question "does infiniband have usable congestion
control for tcp/clustering/networking". I don't actually care if it doesn't
and I'd rather have most congestion control in software anyway.
