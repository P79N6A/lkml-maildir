The CUV266-D is indeed in wide production, and i bought it from
www.komplett.no Unfortunately that site is here in Norway.
I am sure several international sites sell it aswell.

The CUV266-DLS is also available from that page, and they even
have them in stock..

When I'm looking at the lspci -v output, i keep wondering why two
of the chips read "Unknown device 8064".. Shouldn't this be fixed
by a kernel maintainer?
I'll send you the .config tomorrow, and I'll test the 1004 bios version then
too, as i'm not at work today.. =/
