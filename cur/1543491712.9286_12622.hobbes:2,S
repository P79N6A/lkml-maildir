I've been seeing lines in my syslog similar to the following:
Mar 30 12:49:27 meteng kernel: eth0: CU wedged, status 0040 0000, resetting...
There are several entries like this at various times in the day.
Today the machine froze solid for no apparent reason just after
displaying the above message on the console.
The machine is using an EtherExpress 16 (ISA) currently.  Is this
card or driver flawed?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  The machine required
manual fsck after rebooting, and contained a corrupt superblock.
Thanks in advance.
TTYL
