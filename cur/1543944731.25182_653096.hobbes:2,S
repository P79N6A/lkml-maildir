Almost all of them merge perfectly, with no problems what-so-ever. And the 
merge conflicts, when they happen, are generally really trivial, and never 
cause any subtle run-time bugs even if they were to happen.
So in that sense, I think both MAINTAINERS and the deprecation schedule 
are totally uninteresting. Yes, they have merge conflicts. But those merge 
conflicts are really really easy to handle.
