Confused ... you did get the first pull request in the first week.  That
was this:

OK ... that's arguable.  This one is larger than I like because of the
lpfc bug fix patch ... I accept I need to do a better job getting these
into the merge window via the scsi-misc tree.  So I will accept the "too
big" criticism and try to manage the driver maintainers better.
However, I won't accept the "not bug fixes only" criticism at -rc1.  The
problem is that we're trying to stabilise a new feature: bsg.
Unfortunately, the closure of the merge window was really the first time
anyone got to play with all of these features together.  The non-bug fix
changes around bsg have been trying to achieve stability.  The problem
is that there were a few fairly problematic pieces: dependence on
non-modular SCSI; SG header layout and driver implementation.  What we
really don't want is to have a problematic API baked in stone because we
can't do anything other than bug fix updates once the merge window
closes.
The real root cause of all of this is that there's no tree I can
persuade all the interested parties to test that includes all of these
features.  In spite of the fact they've all been incubating in -mm for
at least 3 months, no-one apparently tested all the features together
until 2.6.23-rc1 was released, so then we're scrambling to address the
issues as they arise.
I really, *really* think we need a pre-release tree that consists of all
the upstream targetted features (i.e. all of the for the next merge
window git trees) and nothing else.  -mm doesn't really satisfy this,
because it has so much other stuff that the people I need to get testing
this don't trust it.  The lack of a tree like this that we could have
persuaded people to test for the last month is what's causing us to
scramble like this at the closure of the merge window.
