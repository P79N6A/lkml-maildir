Linus before sounding off why not have a look at the patches concerned. Its
bad when you go around pronouncing on things before looking hard. Eg the
direct I/O stuff has all the hooks to do direct I/O from/to a file system

And funnily enough the instructions for applying his patch start
"copy fs/ext2 to fs/ext3 then..."
