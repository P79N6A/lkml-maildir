- Andy, do you have any number on non largepage order allocations? 
But anti fragmentation as per Mel's patches is not good enough to
provide largepage allocations since we would need to shoot down most of
the LRU to obtain such a large contiguous area. Lumpy reclaim however
can quickly achieve these sizes.
