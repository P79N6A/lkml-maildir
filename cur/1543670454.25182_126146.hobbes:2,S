No, I don't.
I'm using devfs and it works perfectly under 2.5.67-mm3.
Below is part of my .config related to devpts and devfs:
nick@nikolas:/boot$ egrep "DEVFS|DEVPTS" config-2.5.67-mm4-1
CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y
CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y
# CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y
BTW, system is Debian/unstable, daily updated.
Thanks,
	Nick.
