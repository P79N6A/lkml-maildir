Building the 3c509 network driver as a module depends on
netdev_boot_setup_check() which is not exported as a symbol. Patch to
export it is at the end of the email but is probably the wrong fix as this
dependancy was only introduced between 2.5.70 and 2.5.72 somewhere. Other
drivers which now appear to need this symbol are
drivers/net/tokenring/skisa.c
drivers/net/tokenring/smctr.c
drivers/net/tokenring/proteon.c

I would give a "Good luck from me too" but I appear to have left it in my
other email account :-)
