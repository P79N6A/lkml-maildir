It should work fine.  tmpfs has the same limits as any other file system,
2 TB or more, and more than that with CONFIG_LBD.
NOTE, however, that tmpfs does NOT guarantee the data will be in RAM!  It
uses the page cache just like any other file system, and pages out unused
data just like any other file system.  If you just want average-case fast,
it'll work fine.  If you want guaranteed fast, you'll have to work harder.

So create a 15 GB file on an existing machine.  Make it sparse, so you
don't need so much RAM, but test to verify that the kernel doesn't
wrap at 4 GB, and can keep the data at offsets 0, 4 GB, 8 GB, and 12 GB
separate.
Works for me (test code below).

If you're working with > 4GB data sets, I would recommend you think VERY hard
before deciding not to get a 64-bit machine.  If you could just put all 15 GB
into your application's address space:
- The application would be much simpler and faster.
- The kernel wouldn't be slowed by HIGHMEM workarounds.  It's not that bad,
  but it's definitely noticeable.
- Your expensive new machine won't be obsolete quite as fast.
I'd also like to mention that AMD's large L2 TLB is enormously helpful when
working with large data sets.  It's not discussed much on the web sites that
benchmark with games, but it really helps crunch a lot of data.
