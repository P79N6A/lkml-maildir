Yes, and almost none of the kernel headers that have inline code should be
pulled in by libc5.  Those that are required (like socket.h) should have
the code #if'd out.

If that's the case, please explain how I use the C library from C++ on
libc5 systems?  There are commercial apps that require this -- libc5 is
not dead yet!
