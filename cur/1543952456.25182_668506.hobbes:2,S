I'd like to avoid assuming the huge page size is some multiple of MB.
PowerPC will have a 64KB huge page.  Granted, you do fix this in a later
patch, so as long as the whole series goes together this shouldn't cause
a problem.

Since mask can always be derived from order, is there a reason we don't
always calculate it?  I guess it boils down to storage cost vs.
calculation cost and I don't feel too strongly either way.
