I don't know why you want large block device support in 2.4, but it's
now available at  
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/patches
 for IA64
against Bjorn's latest tree.
I haven't tried LVM, but MD with megaraid works on a 4-way Itanium.
JFS doesn't currently work; XFS should but I've only tried ext[23],
reiserfs (both of which work) and JFS (which doesn't).
You'll be limited to 16TB for ext2, and a maximum 2TB file size; XFS
is a better bet, but is not in the core kernel.
