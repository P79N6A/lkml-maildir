Sounds like what you want is a dynamically resizing tmpfs based on the
amount of memory (ram+swap) available. That's a much bigger goose to fry
I believe.
Now, even if the percentile patch took into account swap, you'd still
need to remount tmpfs in order to get it to take into account of any
swap you add on the fly.

I use it for /tmp now just fine. :) It's sized at 63% of 256MB of RAM.
