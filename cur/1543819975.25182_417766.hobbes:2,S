Nothing strikes me, but maybe Andi has a clue.

That looks bogus. %eip is 0x00495000, and might well have taken a fault, 
but it sure ain't a write access. According to the built-in wine debugger 
it was
> 0x00495000 EntryPoint in war3: pushl    %eax
which does do a write, but to %esp (which is 7f9eff0c according to the 
dump, and which is unlikely to have taken a fault, since it's almost 256 
bytes off the end of a page in the stack area).
Alistair, if you can do a "git bisect" on this one, that would help. 
Unless Andi goes "Duh!".
