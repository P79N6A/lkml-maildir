Well if people are doing embedded in close quarters and they can use the
knowledge, they need to have it.  The drive is/was designed to deal with
this issue in several ways.
Testing the for the decay from POST for DEVICE side detection of any
capable cable.  Next if the HOST also supports detection and it senses its
own cable capacitance is acceptable, then it will work.
You need to be able to support conclusions of how and why, because people
will see this in the real world and wonder why.
