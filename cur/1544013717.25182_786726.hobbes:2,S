this is not correct.
when the async_synchronize_cookie() call returns, all previous
acpi_bus_register_async() calls have completed. So no older ones can be
running.
there also can be no newer ones, because newer ones will wait for the
current one to entirely complete before they will return from
acpi_bus_register_async()
so.. since all older ones are complete, and no new ones can happen..
the sequence is strictly followed.
