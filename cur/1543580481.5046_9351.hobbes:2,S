After I compiled kernel 2.4.1 on rh 6.2 I enabled module support for 2
of those devices.
However when I rebooted my machine both of those devices are not
working.
I don't know what's wrong since I did make moudle and make
module_install.
When I try to configure mdoule for the sound card, I get a message
saying that module wasn't found.
For the network card I get Delaying initialization
any suggestions on how to fix it?
