Except running gpm without the -R switch on /dev/psaux can stop the
keyboard from working on a quite large percentage of computers. It
will generate bogus mouse movements and button presses on others. It's
just something that you shouldn't do.
On /dev/ttySx it works, for most mice (those that only use unidirectional
communication), yes.
So, gpm -R is the way to do it now (you have to patch gpm to get wheel
support, though). I hope my drivers will provide a better way to handle
mice, keyboards and other input stuff for the future.
