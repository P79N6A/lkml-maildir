Certainly on my setup, the kernel never even attempts to read the RTC
itself and that's left to a userspace program (hwclock) that gets run
from the boot scripts with the relevant parameters. The said program
also makes use of a SymLink that tells it what the local timezone is,
so has all the information needed to RE-initialise the system clock to
match what the hardware clock claims is the case.

Both are already part of the hwclock program.

Your wording is ambiguous, so I'll deal with both possible meanings:
 a. There are various programs available to synchronise the system
    clock with some external time standard. I use rdate as part of
    my dial up script, and a friend of mine uses a program that
    synchronises his system clock with that broadcast on teletext.
 b. The hwclock program also has the ability to set the RTC from
    the system clock.
The combination of those two means that it is already possible to both
synchronise the RTC with an external time standard and to ensure that
the kernel is itself so synchronised.

Unfortunately, it's already been dealt with in userspace, so any
kernel patch you developed would be unlikely to be applied anyway.
Best wishes from Riley.
