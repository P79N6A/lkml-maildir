How will the path be preserved? Does BK do it now? Can it be transferred
into CVS (for paranoid CVS-won't-screw-us-ever people)? Does this mean
that only the repositories contain the certificates, "final source"
doesn't?

[Nice idea snipped]
Just make sure the relevant open source licenses are in Documentation, and
so is the Certificate du jour. And hash out ideas/scripts to retrieve
proof(s) of origin for a particular line (consider its convoluted history,
originated by Joe Random Hacker, modified by Jane Random and rewritten by
Al Hacker, even Aunt Tillie might have touched it ;-).
