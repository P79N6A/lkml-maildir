Hi guys - could someone please tell me if any Linux kernel currently has
support for I2O (Intelligent Input/Output)?
Sorry to cross-post this - but I need to know urgently...
While I'm here - does anyone know what is a decent amount of I20 Cache for a
RAID controller?  We only seem to have 16Mb out of a possible 128Mb.. it has
been suggested that this could be the cause of an IO bottleneck we're having
with an HP NetServer LH4...
Regards,
Matthew Clark.
