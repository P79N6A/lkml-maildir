It is implined in the background scrubbing, that if a background scrub
page read causes an ECC correctable error to be flagged, the normal
"fix through scrub" behaviour of the memory controller will be
triggered (possibly, the software scrubbing described above).
And if an uncorretable error is detected during the scrub, we have to
do something about it as well.  And that won't be that easy: locate
whatever process is using that page, and so something smart to it...
or do some emergency evasive actions if it is one of the kernel's data
scructures, etc.
So, as you said, "background scrubbing" and "software scrubbing" really are
very different things, and one has to expect that background scrubbing will
eventually trigger software scrubbing, major system emergency handling
(uncorrectable errors in kernel memory) or minor system emergency
handling (uncorrectable errors in process memory).

One might want the possibility of doing inconditional writes, because
it helps with memory bitrot on crappy hardware where the refresh
cycles aren't enough to avoid bitrot.  But you definately won't want
it most of the time.
You can also implement software-based ECC using a background scrubber
and setting aside pages to store the ECC information.  Now, THAT is
probably not worth bothering with due to the performance impact, but
who knows...
