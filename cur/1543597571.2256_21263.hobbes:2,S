Sorry, I've been away for a few days.

So does my usb controller. It seems that all the integrated stuff use IRQ
11.

You know. 2.2.19 uses my cardbus controller on IRQ 11 without a
problem. Could it be something in the way the yenta_socket driver sets up
the controller? I was thinking of dumping the read/write's from the i82365
from 2.2.19, and comparing it to the yenta_socket driver. Do you think
this is worthwhile? I know your time is precious, but I'd like to fix this
problem and will happily do the work if you can spare a few brain cycles
on the problem. ;)
Thanks, Martin
