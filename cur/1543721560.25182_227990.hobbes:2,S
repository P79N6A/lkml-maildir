Yes, I ported the code forward to 2.6.  The netpoll infrastructure needed a
little tweaking to accommodate netdump, but nothing major.  Namely, we need
to reset some locks, and I added an element to the netpoll data structure
for the dump function.  I also updated the zap_completion_queue function to
touch the nmi watchdog.

I'm not quite sure what infrastructure would be shared between the two.
Page selection, perhaps?  Anything else?
