Can you explain what you mean by "pauses for ages when using PIT"? Is it
while running pmstat? What command line options did you use? I think I ran it 
on my LapTop in PIT mode w/o any problems. One problem that I am seeing on a 
SMP machines is that time drifts. I am yet to investigate whether it is a 
problem with that machine or my patch. As I had mentioned before, time 
recovery is still a concern that I have. I dont think it was any better in the
old patch.

Thanks for consolidating all the patches and putting it up on your website! 
Makes it easier for me to send any further patches on top of the above one.
