Your macro modification is wrong.
Take 0x12345600, which is aligned on a 16-byte boundary.
Now, with your macro, we have for a 0x10 alignment:
      (0x12345600 & 0x0f) = (0x00 == 0) == TRUE (correct)
For an 0x20 alignment:
      (0x12345600 & 0x1f) = (0x00 == 0) == TRUE (incorrect)
In other words, the macro may work for some alignments, but
not all. It is therefore wrong. You need the modulus, the
remainder after division. Anything else is broken.
