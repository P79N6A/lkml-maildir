Subject: 2.2.0-"final": aic7xxx still doesn't work with Promise Ultra33 (etc.)

Not surprising since Doug Ledford is away, but nothing has changed in
recent versions of the aic7xxx driver, and it still has serious
problems.  Trying to use an Adaptec 2940UW SCSI card together with a
Promise DC20246 Ultra33 IDE adapter results in either a hard freeze or a
bunch of PCI Master Abort errors, depending on which driver is started
first.  It is unclear if the root of the problem is really in aic7xxx,
the IDE code, or somewhere down in the BIOS code.  This setup worked
fine with the Promise Ultra33 patch in 2.0.35 (and I believe DC20246
support was incorporated by default in later 2.0 kernels).
In addition, there are problems with several types of SCSI tape drives,
which hang up and cannot be reset by anything short of a reboot.  The
problem is said to be in st.c, but that's all I know.  The point is that
this is another facility that worked fine in earlier kernels, and is now
seriously broken.
Finally, there are still some oddities in the xconfig menus, like having
the QIC-02 tape driver and watchdog timer support items show up under
"Mice".
I don't know about Linus, but I would be embarrassed to release a kernel
with that many formerly-working things broken in it.  If I were a
Microsoft publicist, I would be rubbing my hands in anticipation of the
excellent FUD fodder in the new Linux kernel.  New features and new
devices are one thing, but breaking stuff that used to
work--particularly if it prevents systems from booting, like the
aic7xxx-DC20246 conflict does--should be an absolute no-no.
How about having a *real* code freeze, as in: the only fixes allowed are
those that deal with disabling problems in subsystems that worked
properly in 2.0.xx?  Things like swapper optimizations and fixes to
platforms and devices that were not supported previously don't qualify.
