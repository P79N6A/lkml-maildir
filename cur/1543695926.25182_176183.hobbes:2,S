Bluetooth USB crashses
I'm playing with a Bluetooth USB dongle (D-LINK DBT 120) and it works quite 
well,  but when I unplug the dongle the system freeezes immediately. I've 
tried to unplug other USB devices as scanner or printer but without crashes.
System: PIV 2.8 Abit IC7-G MB;
2.6.0-test9 #3 SMP
Relevant Modules:
bnep
l2cap
bluetooth
uhci_hcd
ehci_hcd
hci_usb
rfcomm
I'm not using devfs but udev/sysfs.
I get no informations/messages in logs.
I'm using the same dogle and usb devices on a 2.4.21 kernel (on a different 
HW) and I can remove the dongle without any problem.
If more informations or tries are needed just let me know.
