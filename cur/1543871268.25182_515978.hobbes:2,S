... and if that worries you, use a 64-bit counter.  They're cheap 
(compared to an sprintf), and even if they advance once a nanosecond 
they won't wrap around for over 584 years.

That only makes sense if it matters that the numbers are kept small. 
This is in fact a highly suboptimal constraint, as it is almost 
guaranteed to create wraparounds much sooner, but there are situations 
in which that's the only option, e.g. for pty number allocations due to 
glibc braindamage.
