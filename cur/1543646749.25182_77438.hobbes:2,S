Hi Linus,
The implementation of bcopy() in lib/string.c (and some other places such as
the XFS header files) is incorrect as it implements bcopy as memcpy. This is
wrong: bcopy should be the equivalent of memmove (which handles overlapping
areas correctly).
I've dicussed it with a number of people, and the general consensus seems to
be that it should be nuked entirely? Do you agree?
David
