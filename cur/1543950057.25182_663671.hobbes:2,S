The spec says that IAAD gets cleared when IAA is set.  Clearing
IAAD should strictly speaking never be needed if IAA is seen ...
but my latest patch will do so (on both watchdog and IRQ paths)
when it's set.  Call it paranoia.

Yes; I re-ordered that to read IAAD first, to give more useful
diagnostics in case of an extremely belated trigger of IAA
that follows reading IAAD.

How does the appended patch look?

The appended patch does include a bit of paranoia around IAA and IAAD;
I figure it can't hurt, although at this point I have no particular
reason to believe anyone except VIA has bugs in those areas.

Yeah, that seems like a better place to do it.  All the other callers
guarantee ehci->reclaim is non-null before calling it.  The fact that
it happens in this case suggests IAAD and/or IAAD didn't get cleared
properly.

========== CUT HERE
The recent EHCI driver update to split the IAA watchdog timer out from
the other timers made several things work better, but not everything;
and it created a couple new issues in bugzilla.  Ergo this patch:
  - Handle a should-be-rare SMP race between the watchdog firing
    and (very late) IAA interrupts;
  - Remove a shouldn't-have-been-added WARN_ON() test;
  - Guard against one observed OOPS;
  - If this watchdog fires during clean HC shutdown, it should act
    as a NOP instead of interfering with the shutdown sequence;
  - Guard against silicon errata hypothesized by some vendors:
      * IAA status latch broken, but IAAD cleared OK;
      * IAAD wasn't cleared when IAA status got reported;
The WARN_ON is in bugzilla as 10168; the OOPS as 10078.
