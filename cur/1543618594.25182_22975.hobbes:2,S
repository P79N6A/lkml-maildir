I have experienced corruption under 2.4.17 similar to this, not massive, but
enough corruption to severely restrict operation - files in /etc were
corrupted, mtab couldn't be created on boot thus no other drives were mounted.
Machine was shut down properly prior to this, no oopses or other strange
behaviour (other than my inability to get a Sycard PCMCIA adapter working)
I was still able to log in as root and force a check of / on next reboot,
which fixed the problem up (about 3 files were cleared, including mtab, IIRC).
Config file/system details available if anyone is interested.
Regards,
    Richard
