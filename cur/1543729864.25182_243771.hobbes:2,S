If I am not too confused, you need #4 and #5 out of Manfred's set of
five RCU_HUGE patchset.  They are at:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108546358123902&w=2
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108546384711797&w=2
A little work will be required to get them to apply.  For example, in
the first patch, instead of:
	spin_lock(&rcu_state.mutex);
one would say:
	spin_lock(&rsp->lock);
due to the addition of the _bh() primitives.  The "rcu_ctrlblk."
and "rcu_state." have been replaced by pointers in order to handle
multiple different types of grace periods:
o	Traditional grace periods based on context switch, executing
	in user mode, or running the idle loop.
o	New-age low-latency grace periods based on running with
	interrupts enabled.
