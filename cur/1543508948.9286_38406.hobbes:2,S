At work, I have a dual p5-233mmx (256mb ram) 2 adaptec aha-2940U with a
yamaha 6x 4x recorder (not rw) running on 2.2.10
My home machine is still on 2.2.7.  I have a dual pII-450mhz (512mb ram),
same adaptec controller (one) with a yamaha 4416s.  No problems at all.
Work machine uses debian slink, home uses packages from potato, slink and
hamm (never bothered to completely upgrade).  cdrecord & friends are from
potato as of about a month ago.
