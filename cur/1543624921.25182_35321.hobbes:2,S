Hence my suggestion for a short term solution that's immediately useful 
-- allowing some way to answer "local changes take precedence 100% of 
the time" or "remote changes ..." with a single command.  That was my 
hack solution that I thought would people might find useful when stuck 
with the duplicate-patch situation.
In the command line merge tool, when merging a file-create, "rla" would 
cause the current file conflict, and all future file-create conflicts, 
to be "won" by the remote side -- essentially creating the effect of 
typing "rl" 300 times.
Apply similar logic to the file-rename merge case.  I think the merge 
command I used in 100% of the cases, during that merge, was 'r'.
If you are stuck with the duplicate patch case, as happened here, I just 
want to see the pain eased a bit :)  IMO you can put off the hard 
problem if you make the UI a bit better.
