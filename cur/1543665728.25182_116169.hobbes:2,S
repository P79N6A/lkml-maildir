The biggest bootimage I'm using here is (SuSE 8.2b3 Inst. Kernel+initrd):
-r--r--r--    1 nobody   nogroup   6009856 Mar  6 10:07 bootimage-ziggy
created with mknbi-linux V1.2, so this isn't really the problem.
I'm also using ~4MB sized dos boot images (PQMagic, BIOS updates) without
problems. Don't try this with floppies...
Etherboot is simply pure fun and saved my life a couple of times ;-)
Thanks, Eric!
Bye,
Pete
