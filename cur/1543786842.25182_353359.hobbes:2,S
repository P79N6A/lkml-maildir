I'm not sure that a brsem would make a noticable difference.
It isn't that cpu hotplug semaphore is a performance problem
now, but that it isn't being used in as many cases as it could
be due to its unscalable nature. For example, a while back I
wanted to use it in the fork() path in the scheduler but
couldn't.
Anyway, as I said, you need to be able to back it up with
numbers ;)
