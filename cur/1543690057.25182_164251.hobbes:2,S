The only thing it can break is tg3, which appears to be placing a competing
interpretation upon the handling of this flag.
Given that tg3_netif_stop() will set __LINK_STATE_RX_SCHED and dev_close()
will then loop on it getting cleared again there appears to be a risk that
a dev_close() against tg3 will lock up.
It's all very unclear.  And uncommented, but that is experientially the
same thing :(
