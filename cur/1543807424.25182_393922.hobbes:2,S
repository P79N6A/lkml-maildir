well, if the pagecache is filled on a node above a certain ratio then 
one would have to spread it out forcibly. But otherwise, try to keep 
things as local as possible, because that will perform best. This is 
different from the case Paul's patch is addressing: workloads which are 
known to be global (and hence spreading out is the best-performing 
allocation).
(for which problem i suggested a per-mount/directory/file 
locality-of-reference attribute in another post.)
