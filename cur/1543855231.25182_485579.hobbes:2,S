Subject: [PATCH] MPT:  make all Fusion MPT sub-choices singly selectable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Put all of the Fusion MPT sub-choices under a single top-level
config entry.

  Is there any reason that the sub-choices for Fusion MPT can't be
selected or deselected en masse, the way it's done for, say, MTD
support and other components?
  There are other locations where this simplification could be used
but I thought I'd wait for some feedback on this example first.
