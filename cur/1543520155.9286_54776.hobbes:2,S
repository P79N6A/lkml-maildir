Not enough. You'll have to wire the source - otherwise you are in for
interesting races. Yes, doing it on per-target-page basis is probably the
right thing, _but_ you may be in for very nasty situations with massive
writev() (think scatter-gather IO from a thousand of pages - each
contributing a couple of bytes).
