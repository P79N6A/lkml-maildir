Ah, ok, so you're saying that these warnings would not lead to build
failures in any case, so we might as well not print the warnings at all?
I can't confirm that, have never tried to build these drivers here (don't
have m68k / powerpc boxen), so perhaps you're right.

There is nothing that is "made worse" by the "select -> default .. if .."
kind of conversion here.
In any case, the problem with Sam's patch is that it gets rid of
warnings for all cases where someone is trying to "select" a config
option that does not exist at all (and perhaps some of those cases
_could_ lead to build breakages).
