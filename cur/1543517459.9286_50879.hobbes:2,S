Hi All,
I'm hoping someone can help.  I royally hosed this system!!  I have a system
with an 8GB drive with 3 partitions (hopefully):  NT 2.1GB, swap 133MB and
Linux having the rest.  I am desparately trying to get it so it will dual
boot properly.
NT isn't booting because there isn't any type of BootManager software there
to tell it to boot so the host automatically went to Linux (RH v6.0 upgraded
to v2.2.13).  I wanted to go back into NT, add some sort of BootManager
software (probably from PartitionMagic), and then use it to dual boot, but I
couldn't boot into NT from Lilo, etc.
I tried fdisking the drive to clear it and to create new partitions from
both Dos and Linux floppies, but the host still tries booting from Linux.
I've tried reinstalling both NT & Linux and reformatting the drive from Dos
(not necessarily in that order!), but Linux still tries to boot.
Does the MBR still hold the boot files for Linux?  How do I entirely clear
the drive so I can do a clean install of NT and Linux??
I apologize if this is off-topic or not the forum for this question.  Any
suggestions are greatly appreciated!
TIA!
Heather
