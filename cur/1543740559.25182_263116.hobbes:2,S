OK, so this is the patch then.  We strip " when we hand to __setup or
put into the environment.
Rusty.
Name: Remove quotes around environment variables
Status: Booted on 2.6-bk
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
As noticed by Joey Hess (and thanks for Christoph for forwarding it).
Also requirements from Werner Almesberger.
If someone passes 'foo="some value"' the param engine removes the
quotes and hands 'foo' and 'some value'.  The __setup() parameters
expect a single string, and so we try to regenerate it from the two
parts.  Finally, we try to place it as an environment variable.
Werner wants quotes stripped out of the environment variable.  It
makes sense to do that for __setup, too (so it sees 'foo=some value'),
since __setup functions don't usually handle quotes.
