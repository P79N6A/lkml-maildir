That may be the case but when I've measured the actual delay of schedule 
timeout when using nanosleep from userspace, the average at 1000Hz was 1.4ms 
+/- 1.5 sd . When we're expecting a sleep of "up to 1ms" we're getting 50% 
longer than the longest expected. Purely mathematically the accuracy of 
changing HZ from 1000 -> 864 will not bring with it any significant change to 
the accuracy. This can easily be measured as well to confirm. 
Using schedule timeout as an argument against it doesn't hold for me. 
Vojtech's comment of :

is probably the most valid argument against such a funky number.
