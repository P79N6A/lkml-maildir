Subject: cpu binding bug?

Afaics cpu bindings could allow a thread to run with an "unlimited"
timeslice.
cpu0: one thread running with 'nice==19'.
	NICE_TO_TICKS==1.
cpu1: lots of other threads with 'nice==0' (NICE_TO_TICKS==6)
cpu0 will enter schedule() every tick.
can_schedule() returns '0' for all threads bound to cpu1, thus
'recalculate' will be called every tick - that's faster than the threads
on cpu1 can use up their slice.
The currently running thread will run forever.
Is that problem fixed in the patches that allow user space to write
cpus_allowed?
