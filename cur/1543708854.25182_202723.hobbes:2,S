Well the tools are in ext3 CVS (
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/ext3/
)
but the issue is how to drive them to create a particular scenario.
I never wrote that down, but there's heaps and heaps of info in the
changelogs:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/user=akpm/ChangeSet?nav=
!-|index.html|stats|!+|index.html
22000 lines of stuff there, so `bk revtool' and a fast computer may be a
more convenient navigation system.
That's not particularly useful, sorry.
