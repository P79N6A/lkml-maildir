Yes, it isn't "obviously" the place at all.
However, the SB AWE series all have a severe bug in their PnP
information; specifically, the WaveTable device ("CTL009C" or
"CTL00E4" on the two cards I have) claims to want a single I/O address
at 0x0620; in fact, it wants *three* addresses (at 0x0620, 0x0A20,
0x0E20) and they all have to be activated.  Every single AWE card I
have seen has this bug.
