As Christian Borntraeger already said, it's not so much an explosion of 
module probes but rather the triggering of quite a lot of events. 
Imagine loading scsi_debug with 512 devices or more ...

Hmm; looks good, but: It's not possible to reliably change the maximum 
number of processes on the fly.
The trivial way of course it when the waitqueue is empty and no 
processes are holding the semaphore. But it's quite non-obvious how this 
should work if processes are already holding the semaphore.
We would need to wait for those processes to finish, setting the length 
of the queue to 0 (to disallow any other process from grabbing the 
semaphore), and atomically set the queue length to the new value.
Apart from the fact that we would need a worker thread for that 
(otherwise the calling process might block indefinitely), there is no 
guarantee that the queue ever will become empty, as hotplug processes 
might be generated at any time.
Or is there an easier way?
Cheers,
Hannes
