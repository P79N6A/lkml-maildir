16550A, built into the motherboard. I've only got ttyS0 and ttyS1. None
of the bios options I found seemed to affect this. (They were only io
Port/IRQ and enable/disable settings)

setserial -a /dev/ttyS0:
/dev/ttyS0, Line 0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4
	Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
	closing_wait: 3000, closing_wait2: infinte
	Flags: spd_normal skip_test
setserial -a /dev/ttyS1:
/dev/ttyS1, Line 1, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x02f8, IRQ: 3
	Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor: 0
	closing_wait: 3000, closing_wait2: infinte
	Flags: spd_normal skip_test
It says this in both 2.2.13pre15 and 2.3.19, before and after the
setserial command.
2.3.19 was the first 2.3 kernel I've tried since 2.3.3 or so. (As I said
above, I only recently switched kernel series). I can try backing out
the serial changes that went in during 2.3.16 if you want, but I've got
an assignment due tommorrow, so I won't be able to until then.
