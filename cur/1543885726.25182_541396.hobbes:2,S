There is one small problem with any of such approach, and this problem
is called Adrian Bunk :)
Eventually he will remove whatever changes you did if there are no
in-kernel users.
But since find bus users are now going into the tree, it is possible to
make a lot of people happy, who remove ifdef around find_bus() in own
embedded trees.
So, my vote is for exporting generic find_bus in mainline with related
to w1 and battery status changes.
