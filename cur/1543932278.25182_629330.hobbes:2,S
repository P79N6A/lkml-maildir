Yes. That's the purpose of this filesystem.

Excuse me, but I guess you meant "mount --bind /dev/ /root/" or something
because mount operation requires directories.
MAC can prevent a rogue CAP_SYS_MOUNT process from doing
"mount --bind /dev/ /root/".
For example, regarding TOMOYO Linux, you need to give
"allow_mount /dev/ /root/ --bind 0" permission
to permit "mount --bind /dev/ /root/" request.
Did you mean "ln -s /dev/hda1 /dev/null" or "ln /dev/hda1 /dev/null"?
No problem. MAC can prevent such requests too.
Regards.
