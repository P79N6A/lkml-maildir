With classic 512 byte sectors the top size is right about 2TB.
The basic thought is that 64bit numbers tend to suck, so we don't
want then in any fast paths on a 32bit system.

For now yes it does.

Using a 64bit number of 32bit systems has so far been trashed.
Though this does look like a real problem that needs to be solved
at some point.  I doubt we can wait past 2.5 though if we want the
code ready when the hardware is.
