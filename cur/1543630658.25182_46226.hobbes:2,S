The pdf's there are somewhat up to date, the html version has fallen
behind quite a bit due to lack of time on my part. Christoph Hellwig
offered to update that, but I believe he's also been quite busy of
late.
In theory it could be mostly automated. The only reason I didn't do it
already was every time I updated it so far, the names of the html
files changed, which meant lots of manual 'cvs add' & 'cvs remove'
operations to kernelnewbies CVS.
iirc, Christoph had a workaround for this problem..
