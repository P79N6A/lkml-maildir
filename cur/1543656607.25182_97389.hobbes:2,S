OK, I'm sorry. This is a little different from what we have at
bugizlla.redhat.com. I suspect OSDL's OPEN roughly corresponds
to NEW. They appear to use Bugzilla which closely resembles the
mother of all them at Mozilla.

I see the point. I would say, having an owner does not mean
much. Owner is just a person who makes sure bugs do not get lost.
You can work on my bugs if you'd like :)
I understand now that I carry a whole load of misconceptions
caused by extensive use of a slighly different process at Red Hat.
Perhaps we ought to tap into Mozilla people expirience.
