the NFS ones seemed to be the least clear ones. I'm glad you converted
those already :-)

it is not strictly a bug, but that technique was discouraged for years -
completions are cleaner and faster for that purpose anyway. (they were
designed for what in the semaphore case is the slowpath.)

Applied. The sym53c8xx_2 looks good. aic7xxx is good too except for a
minor cleanup issue: i've changed all _sem symbols to be _done symbols.
It's not a semaphore anymore, lets avoid the namespace-rotting effect. 
I've put these into -U8 so anyone hitting aic7xxx or sym53c8xx_2 should
re-download the -U8 patch. (others who have already downloaded it should
not bother.)
