Subject: [PATCH 0/2] x86: move warning message of polling idle and HT enabled, take 3

This patch set for printing properly the warning message;
"polling idle and HT enabled, performance may degrade"
The warning message is never shown because smp_num_sibling hasn't
been updated yet at idle_setup().
So I moved the warning to select_idle_routine() and made it called
after detect_ht().
It also needs Andi's patch for 32-bit.
