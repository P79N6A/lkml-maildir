Hmm, why would it do that?  This seems like it's glibc being stupid.
That said, you are right that the libfs readdir implementation is not
strictly standards conforming.  But neither is your patch: this
algorithm will break if the entry at the current position is removed
and then a new entry with the same name is created.

Unfortunately I can't since I don't have such old glibc.
