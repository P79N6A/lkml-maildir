Thomas has indicated that these trees might not be very long-lived. So
instead, I've added the ability to make local extensions:
.ketchuprc:
local_trees = {
    '2.6-kt': (latest_dir,
               "
http://www.tglx.de/projects/ktimers/patch-
%(full)s.patch",
               r'patch-(2.6.*?)',
               0, "Thomas Gleixner's ktimers."),
    '2.6-kthrt': (latest_dir,
                  "
http://www.tglx.de/projects/ktimers/patch-
%(full)s.patch",
                  r'patch-(2.6.*?)',
                  0, "Thomas Gleixner's ktimers and HRT patches.")
    }
$ ./ketchup -s 2.6-kt
2.6.14-rc4-kthrt3.patch

That's been in tip for a while:
