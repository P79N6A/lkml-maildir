Yup.

Yes, it can.

I'd expect it to occur if you simply pass an unmapped address
to write()?

It matters.  -ac kernels handle this by clearing out the blocks
on the error path in __block_prepare_write().  If you retest with
-ac kernels, you should just see zeroes.

abort_write() is an expediency - it was (much) easier and safer
to add a new operation rather than running all over the kernel
and redefining the commit_write() API.
ext3 definitely needs to know about prepare/commit imbalance in
lo_send() and generic_file_write(), and in block_symlink() if that
is ever changed to error out after the prepare_write().
But long-term, we need to change the commit_write() definition so
that it is called even in the error case, thus informing the
underlying fs of the partial write.
