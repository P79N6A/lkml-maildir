   then I get another unresolved symbol:
   __umodi3
Someone needs to add this routine under arch/sparc/lib/
   I'm guessing that there is some optimization the compiler is doing that
   is using the mod operator somehow, but I am unsure about how to work around
   this.
"guessing"?  Have a look the definition of do_div in asm-sparc/div64.h
it explicitly does a mod operation :-)
