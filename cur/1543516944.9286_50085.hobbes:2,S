This I know, but I guess you didn't understand my question.
From what I understood, what the Rocketport driver does is:
- Copy data from the hardware to a memory buffer (coincidentally, but not 
  necessarily, the flip buffer, correct ?!?!);
- Call ldisc.receive_buf directly, passing the memory buffer address and
  the number of bytes on this buffer (among other arguments);
My question is: what happens if the number of bytes passed to
ldisc.receive_buf is bigger than the number of available bytes in the TTY
buffer??
My concern is because with the flip buffers, the data was in a "safe
place", i.e., in a place the TTY driver knows the location, so that it
could go back to it later if necessary. With the flip buffer bypass, the
location of the buffer is random (i.e., depends on the serial driver), so
how will the TTY driver handle the data that it couldn't place in its
internal TTY buffer due to lack of space??
One more question: if the driver is supposed to know this limit
beforehand, where can it get this information (i.e., info about how many
bytes are available in the TTY Rx buffer) ?? I don't see any check of this
kind in the Rocketport driver ...

Ivan
