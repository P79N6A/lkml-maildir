Yes, my earlier-posted algorithm was just plain wrong.  So that's one
item out of the way.

It doesn't strike me as difficult or costly to accomodate this.

It only needs to be turned off when unloading one of the "hard" modules.
This would be an incrementing disable to accodate simultaneous unloads.
During the unload your desktop might get a little bit less interactive,
but that's better than not being able to unload at all.

Then everybody would complain about the extra overhead, no matter how
small it is.  Conceptually, are there any outstanding issues with "hard"
way of unloading modules, assuming we can use the TRY_INC way[1] for
"easy" modules?  One I don't recall being discussed, is the inherent
difficulty of unhooking an interface like LSM, one function at a time.
[1] Or a related way, to be determined via the tag-team mud-wrestling
method.
