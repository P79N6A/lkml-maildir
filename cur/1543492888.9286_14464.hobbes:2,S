From your writing it appears that you're assuming that the Linux kernel
contains true capability support. Unfortunatelly, this is not so. The Linux
kernel contains support for capability lists, which is a different concept than
true (or pure) capabilities. Since most of the people refer to what is in the
kernel as 'capabilities', the confusion is inherent as newcomers who have read
about computer security get an impression that the kernel contains a powerful
token (aka key/lock aka descriptor aka true (pure) capability) based security
mechanism, when it really contains a fundamentally broken and abandoned (by the
people who put it together) concept of POSIX privileges (aka capability lists).
People who have studied security systems have learned to make a clear
distinction between the two concepts as the similiarities (besides them both
being security mechanisms) between them usually boil down to the word
'capability'.

As they say, the proof is in the pudding, so by all means, feel free to pursue
your implementation. Using capability lists is usually the last mistake that
people make when designing their security components, so I'd expect to have
this topic brought up relatively soon again.
