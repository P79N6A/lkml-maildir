I actually used 2.3.47pre7/inode-corruption-2.gz, applied over
2.3.47pre7 obviously, and under conditions which would previously have
been guaranteed to give me the Input/output error bug (unpacked 2.3.0,
applied each patch from 2.3.1 up to 2.3.47pre7 in two different trees
simultaneously, all while debian apt upgraded my system), there was no
corruption.  Keeping my fingers crossed...
Thanks for the good work.
