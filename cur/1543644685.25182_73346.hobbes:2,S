Sure, but then every process that is concerned with a single event has to
not only receive every event, but parse every event.  And if this is to be
truly generic, that could be a lot of events.

True, and if a dev_event file were created, I'd consider doing it that way.
But in that case it's easier for apps to talk to eventd (nee acpid) and get
only the messages they want.
