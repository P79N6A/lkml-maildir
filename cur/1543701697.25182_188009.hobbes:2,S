Hi,
I'm mailing to inform you of a possible bug in the vesa framebuffer module 
which has been appearing in the kernel since 2.5.51. I posted at the
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org mailinglist but wasn't able to get feedback so 
I'm directing it directly to the developers of the framebuffer layer and to 
you specifically since you were involved with most of the changes in 2.5.51.
I have attached grabbed framebuffer distortion pics (png) since I think those 
speak clearer than my previous attempts to put the problem into words through 
the mailing list. 
Hope you can shed more light on the situation.
Thanks,
S Ait-Kassi
