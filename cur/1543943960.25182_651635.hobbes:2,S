+   Linux memory policy supports the following optional mode flag:

+	MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES:  This flag specifies that the nodemask passed by
+	the user should not be remapped if the task or VMA's set of accessible
+	nodes changes after the memory policy has been defined.

+	    Without this flag, anytime a mempolicy is rebound because of a

+	    previously undesired.  With this flag, the policy is either
+	    effected over the user's specified nodemask or the Default
