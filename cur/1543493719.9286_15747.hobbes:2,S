Hello, all.
I've got a Fujitsu MO drive which uses 2048-byte sectors and is attached
through a BusLogic PCI controller. Everything worked well in 2.2.1, but in
2.2.5 (yes, I am aware that this is a jump) and 2.2.6, all disks formatted
under 2.2.1 cannot be mounted -- no superblock can be found.
Using mke2fs -b 2048 under 2.2.5/6 reveals that the device is now
considered to have 1241056 blocks -- exactly 4 times too many (the drive
should normally have 310264 2048-byte blocks), leading me to believe that
somewhere we're back to thinking that this is a 512-byte sector drive
again, even though mke2fs reports that it's using a 2048-byte sector size,
and the kernel reports this as well when a disk is inserted. And indeed,
trying to make an ext2 filesystem on a disk under 2.2.5/2.2.6 goes well
until we reach the end of the available disk space, and mke2fs then goes
on to print an endless string of errors, one per block (because they're
not there!)
I've tried checking for changes between 2.2.1 and 2.2.5/6 in a few places
in fs/ext2, fs, and drivers/scsi, but not being a kernel hacker in any
sense of the word, I haven't found anything that seems to be the problem.
Has anyone else experienced this problem?
