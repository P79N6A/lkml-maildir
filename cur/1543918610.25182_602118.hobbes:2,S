Yes.  So what is it to be?
Is limiting by device queues enough?
Or do we need some global limit?
If so, the cleanest way I see is to separately account and limit
swap-writeback pages, so the global counters don't interfere with the
limiting.
This shouldn't be hard to do, as we have the per-bdi writeback
counting infrastructure already, and also a pseudo bdi for swap in
swapper_space.backing_dev_info.
