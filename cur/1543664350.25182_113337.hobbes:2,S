	Right.  I've checked in the fix.  Thanks.

	I've just come across a bug with in in 2.5.63 where
devfs_helper hangs while trying to down a semaphore.  I think it is
doing down(&dir->i_sem) in some lookup routine in fs/namei.c.
I am trying to figure out what exactly inode->i_sem protects
so I can determine if it is OK for the routine that calls
defvs_helper to release it and reacquire it when devfs_helper
exits.  Once I think I've fixed this, I'll post a new patch.
