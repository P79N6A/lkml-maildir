I think the "jiffies variable is special" part misses the
"for stupid legacy reasons" explanation.
According to the other volatile rules one should use
something like that:
extern unsigned long __jiffies;
static inline unsigned long read_ulong(unsigned long *addr)
{
	return *(volatile unsigned long *)addr;
}
static inline unsigned long get_jiffies(void)
{
	return read_ulong(&__jiffies);
}
But of course changing all references to jiffies in the kernel would
be insane, thus jiffies is special "for stupid legacy reasons".
Right?
