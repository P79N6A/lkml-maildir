Apologies if this is a known issue, but:
DMA'ing across hard drives (note: NOT CD-ROM) will cause
file corruption on a heavily loaded system with kernel
2.2.14 and VIA MVP3
Details:
Test consists of compiling a kernel while playing an MP3 and
copying files from one location to another. When the copy is
done, diff --recursive states that files differ.
This is true of:
-DMA enabled on both drives, copying from one hard drive to
another, playing the MP3 from one drive and compiling on the
other.
-DMA enabled on both drives and the CD, playing and copying
from the CD to one drive (this is known to possibly cause a
lockup bug on VIA chipsets, IIRC). Also true of copying off
the CD and playing from the drive.
-DMA enabled on both drives but *not* the CD, copying CD to
drive and playing from either the CD or the drive
The *only* reliable situation is when DMA is disabled for
all drives. Then, any combination of the above works.
Q: Might this be addressed in 2.3? Would trying 2.3 provide
useful data?
System details:
FIC PA-2013 rev 2.0 via MVP3 chipset, BIOS 1.15
128MB RAM
WD Caviar 17GB (hdc) and Quantum Fireball 4.3 (hda) IDE.
2.2.14
loosely Debian 2.0 based install.
If I can provide any more information, please let me know.
