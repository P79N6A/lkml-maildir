I think we agree.  But we still live in the present.

Indeed.

Which is why each architecture must always have the option of providing 
its own fast path implementation according to a number of factors that 
cannot be made into a generic layer.  But this is the same issue whether 
we talk about semaphores or mutexes.

Because embedded people want it.  ARM is also about the only 
architecture besides x86 that currently sees most of the RT work for the 
same reason.  And yes preemption does make a difference.

The above is 5 cycles.  About the same as the preemption-safe swp-based 
mutex implementation on non-Intel ARM.  It is broken wrt interrupts when 
the swp is not.  It doesn't work with preemption while the swp 
implementation is potentially smaller with cse and it works in all 
cases.
I mean...... what is it with mutexes that you dislike to the point of 
bending backward that far, and even after seeing the numbers, with such 
a semaphore implementation that _I_ even wouldn't trust people to use 
correctly?  Yes we should use complete() from interrupt handlers but I 
can bet you that a lot of people are still using up() there, and with 
the current up() implementation it just _works_ at least on ARM.

On XScale you should add 2 cycles to branch to the out of line code and 
2 other cycles to branch back.
The ARM mutex implementation can save that and have an extremely small 
inlined footprint already.
Again what do you dislike so much about mutexes?  It must not have much 
to do with technical issues at this point.  ;-)
