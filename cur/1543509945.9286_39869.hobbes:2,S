I've seen something that looks exactly like this using vesafb and
fbcon on i386 hardware. Same reproduction scenario, only the oops was
in fbcon_cfb8_putcs. I'm at work right now, so I don't have the oops
at hand, but I'd be more that happy to provide further information if
needed.

Unfortunately yes - in my case it occurred on a UP system.
