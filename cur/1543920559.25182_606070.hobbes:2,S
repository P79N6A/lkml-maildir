After that, is the ramdisk useful for anything aside from testing?

We have 2 problems. First is that, for testing/consistency, we
don't want BLKFLSBUF to throw out the data. Maybe hardly anything
uses BLKFLSBUF now, so it could be just a minor problem, but still
one to fix.
Second is actually throwing out the ramdisk data. dd from /dev/null
isn't trivial because it isn't a "command" from the kernel's POV.
rd could examine the writes to see if they are zero and page aligned,
I suppose... but if you're transitioning everyone over to a new
method anyway, might as well make it a nice one ;)

truncate_range, I suppose. A file descriptor syscall based
alternative for madvise would be nice though (like fallocate).
We could always put something in /sys/block/ram*/xxx
