Looks like Greg's patch to use more dev_*() debug macros changed
some conditional structures too ... so the sysfs debug files are
always compiled in, rather than only with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG which
is what defines them.
Workaround by enabling USB debugging in your configuration.
I'll send some patch around later, likely to just revert that
part of his patch since I actually like having "production"
OHCI modules be less than 12K.  Though maybe those files should
be enabled with some other Kconfig option.  Thoughts?
