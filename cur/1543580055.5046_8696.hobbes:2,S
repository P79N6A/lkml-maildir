Looks like one you've already fixed. I've retested and recreated it 
but it only happens with 2.2.13 not with the other two kernel sources 
I have (2.2.18 and 2.4.0). I also misinformed you about the way to 
recreate it, I had specified only append="matrox" in my lilo.conf. It 
was 2.2.13 that I did my experimentation on to get it to work in the 
first place and never bothered to retest afterwards. Sorry for the 
false alarm...
