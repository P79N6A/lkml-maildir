I've watched the vmscan code at work.  The memory pressure is so high
that it reclaims mapped pages zealously.  The program's code pages are
being evicted frequently.
I would like to show a video of the ls -l /proc command.  It's
remarkable.  The program pauses after displaying each line.

    # mount
    rootfs on / type rootfs (rw)
    /dev/root on / type nfs (rw,v2,rsize=4096,wsize=4096,hard,udp,nolock,addr=192.168.8.1)
    proc on /proc type proc (rw)
    devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
I've been wondering if the swappiness isn't a red herring.  Is it
reasonable that the distress value (in refill_inactive_zones ()) be
50?
