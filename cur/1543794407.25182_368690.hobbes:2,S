Such a patchset would be pretty intrusive and it's not exactly trivial - at
each site we need to decide whether we should be using signed or unsigned,
then change one or the other, then do a full-scope check to see what the
implications of that change are.
I think the two risks of signedness sloppiness are a) inadvertent or
premature overflow and b) comparisons, where the signed quantity went
negative.
Problem b) is more serious, and `gcc -Wsigned-compare' may be used to
identify possible problems.  There are quite a lot of places need checking,
iirc.
