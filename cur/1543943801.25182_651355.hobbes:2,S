Hi Abel,
lkml is the most official forum you can find.

Well, bb386nc has its e_flags set to 0x2, which means that the binary is 
of type EF_BFIN_FDPIC.
The fdpic handler returns ENOENT if the PT_INTERP field of the binary is 
malformed, which is what you are probabling hitting here:
                        retval = -ENOENT;
                        if (interpreter_name[phdr->p_filesz - 1] != '\0')
                                goto error;
The 'standard' ELF binary handler returns ENOEXEC in such cases, and this 
is the difference you are seeing here.
I basically think that both errnos are allowed here:
ENOENT The file filename or a script or ELF interpreter does not exist, or 
a shared library needed for file or interpreter cannot be found.
ENOEXEC An executable is not in a recognized format, is for the wrong 
architecture, or has some other format error that means it cannot be 
executed.
