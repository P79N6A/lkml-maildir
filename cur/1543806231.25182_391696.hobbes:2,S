Well, Jörg is not giving us answers to the extent that might convince a
Linux kernel hacker to change things, except for a few handrails besides
the staircase, such as Ted's suggestion WRT RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, or people
offering to fix ide-tape to talk SG_IO - Jörg however has not yet
documented how ide-tape fixes are relevant for the CD writing
application (no doubt that a SCSI /GENERAL/ interface library has
interest in such, it does not matter to the CD writing topic).

I find it fascinating that everyone talks about the first public GPL v3
draft as though it were the final version. Now is the time to express
concerns, for instance, the GPL's incompatibility, to the FSF.
And no, I do not have current plans to work on a cdrecord fork as it is.
