You mean 
arch/i386/boot/.gitignore
arch/i386/boot/tools/.gitignore
arch/i386/oprofile/Kconfig
include/asm-i386/poll.h
include/asm-i386/emergency-restart.h
include/asm-i386/spinlock_types.h
include/asm-i386/vga.h
include/asm-i386/msidef.h
include/asm-i386/hypertransport.h
include/asm-i386/ioctl.h
include/asm-i386/fcntl.h
? 
[of which several just #include <asm-generic/foo.h] ? 
I suppose msidef.h and hypertransport.h should be shared agreed; 
for the others it is not obvious. spinlock_types will likely fork soon;
it used to be different in the past already and will be again.
