Hello Everyone,
Please accept my apologies if this topic has been covered before, however I
need to setup a linux system to test and collect the variation in reboot time
after a hard reboot of the system, (i.e. power cycle).  Therefore, I was hoping
that at least one or more of the Linux gurus could provide me with different
ways to perform a hard reboot in software if possible...
Specifically at a high level, I am planning to setup two machines that utilize 
the HA heartbeat facility to monitor some number of heartbeats and then tell the
other machine to do a hard crash and then time how long it takes for the other
machine to re-establish the heartbeat...
Thanks in advance for any help or advice...
Please feel free to respond directly to me through email, as well 
-- Chris
