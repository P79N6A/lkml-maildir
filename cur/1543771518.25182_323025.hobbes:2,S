Hi Clemens,
I think it could. However for conveniance I implemented it as a
seperate addressable entity.
For userspace I want things to be simple, just a simple echo should be
sufficient to manipulate the LCD:
For example:
   echo -n "3 A  1.0 0 0" > /sys/.../line1
in order to set the lcd. In order to read back the contents of the lcd:
  cat  /sys/.../line1
  8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.888  <= format string, see below
  3 A   1.0 0 0        <= contents
When the dot is encoded in the digit you would lose a digit when a 
dot is printed. In a two segment display with dots "1.0" can not be 
printed.
I don't want kernelcode trying to decide if it should collapse "1." in
a single digit or not. These implicit functional rules are always a
pain in the ass when not implmented at the right level. And don't 
belong in the kernel.
Best regards,
Henk
