It seems to me that a ramdisk is a waste of space if it's preloaded by the 
bootloader from anywhere that's physically accessible by the kernel.
Many people have been doing so on embedded systems because we haven't had 
drivers for flash chips and flash filing systems. (plug plug)
My current inclination is to make CONFIG_BLK_DEV a config option, turn it
off to save space, and use JFFS directly on flash chips, with ramfs for /tmp
and possibly also /var
I'm fairly sure that ramfs does share pages as you'd hope it does.
