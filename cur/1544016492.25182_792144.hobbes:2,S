It's not good to randomly sprinkle blkdev_issue_flush() calls all over
the filesystem like this.  How do we know that you didn't miss a site? 
How do we ensure that people who modify the fs in the future don't
forget to add the blkdev_issue_flush() call, if needed?
IOW, it is fragile.  Is there anything we can do to make this more
robust?  Do the flush calls from some higher-level callsite?  Perhaps
even the VFS?

The patch itself would have been a bit neater if it had added
int ext3_blkdev_issue_flush(struct inode *inode)
and called that, IMO.
Also, the changelog needs some work, methinks.
/**
 * blkdev_issue_flush - queue a flush
 * @bdev:	blockdev to issue flush for
 * @error_sector:	error sector
 *
 * Description:
 *    Issue a flush for the block device in question. Caller can supply
 *    room for storing the error offset in case of a flush error, if they
 *    wish to.  Caller must run wait_for_completion() on its own.
 */
So afaict the change you've made is incomplete.  We'll queue a
writeback command to the disk but we won't wait for it to be sent down
the wire.  Nor do we wait for the command to complete at the device
end.  So it can still be a looong time (seconds!) before the data which
the user thinks is on disk really is safe.
Yes?
If so, this design decision should be described in the changelog, and
justified.  Actually, doing this in the comment over
ext3_blkdev_issue_flush() would be good.
