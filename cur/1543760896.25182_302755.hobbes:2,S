Yes - is pretty much exactly what I saw with this too, even if we only
prefaulted up to 4 pages that were already in the pagecache. The additional
cost in zap_pte_rage etc killed us, and it was wholly detrimental.
I think we need better locality in glibc, etc before this is of much use.
I had a debug patch somewhere to show how sparse the layout of ptes was,
I'll see if I can find it.
