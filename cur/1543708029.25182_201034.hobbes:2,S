The patch '[Bluetooth] Initial sysfs and device class support', is the
usual misguided sysfs conversion attempt levaing oopsable races, so
please back it out until the bluetooth folks have understood and cared
for the lifetime rule issues of using the driver model.
Guys, if you do use the driver model you have to adhere to it's life
time rules.  And that's most importantely you _must_ free the device
only in it's ->release routine.
And no, the code doesn't warn about the lack of a release method only
that everyone adds an empty one, sigh..
