Btw, if you want to have the _question_ always be y/n only, that's easy 
enough to do, just make that one do
	config SATA_MENU
		bool "Want to see SATA drivers"
		depends on SCSI != n
	config SCSI_SATA
		tristate
		depends on SCSI && SATA_MENU
		default y
and now you have a totally sensible setup, where the low-level drivers can 
depend on something sane. 
I don't think it _buys_ you anything, but hey, at least it's logical. 
Btw, wouldn't it be much nicer to also have this all in a totally separate 
Kconfig file? That SCSI Kconfig file is one of the biggest ones (yeah, 
drivers/net/Kconfig is bigger, but hey, that's not a surprise, is it ;)
