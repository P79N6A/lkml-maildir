I have the eepro driver compiled into a monolithic kernel. After rebooting
a couple dozen times trying to find a pattern I can't see one, except for
one fact worth noticing.
As long as the network cable is pulled, everything's groovy. Kernel boots
nicely without triggering it, ifconfig doesn't trigger it, route doesn't
trigger it, but putting the cable in, immediately triggers it upon packet
traffic.
* put cable in *
eth0: card reports no RX buffers.
eth0: card reports no resources.
eth0: card reports no RX buffers.
eth0: card reports no resources.
:> ifconfig eth0 down
eth0: 0 multicast blocks dropped.
Is it worth analyzing packet traffic and comparing with the timestamps in
syslog to see what kind of packet triggers it, or whether any packet
triggers it?

Maybe due to the issues with the NIC. All interesting hosts are now
in /etc/hosts, so we'll see.
Other stuff that might be of interest:
PCI Info:
  Bus  0, device  13, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 8).
      IRQ 9.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd4800000 [0xd4800fff].
      I/O at 0x9800 [0x983f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd4000000 [0xd40fffff].               
Card shares IRQ 9 with 2 other devices:
    irq  9:       620 acpi, bttv, eth0
Need any other info?
