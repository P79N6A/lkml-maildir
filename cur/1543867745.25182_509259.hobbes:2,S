I definitely agree that the above is an accurate assessment.
There is a flip side too.  For hardware vendors, there is an interesting 
dynamic of cooperation /and/ competition.  Hardware vendors still 
compete based on features, IP, and many other levels.
A hardware vendor that is unaware of how to compete in an open source 
world is a hardware vendor with a big fat hole in their business model.
It isn't usually politically correct to state this out loud, but, 
hardware vendors still compete quite heavily using "closed" intellectual 
property.  With open source, the lines just shift.
