It would almost have to be emulation.. I haven't seen a system that supports
segmentation in user mode in quite a while.

news to my AIDA compiler... (though that may be due to DOS no longer working
on anything recent.. BTW.. it is the old z compiler thing that only supported 
16bit addressing with segmentation.. I'm dropping that turd and only keeping
the language reference after my relocation completes.. and the 286 is going 
in the spare parts bin).
Though I did know AMD supported the IA32, I didn't think the Itanium supported
that old an instruction set as the 186 segmentation support.
