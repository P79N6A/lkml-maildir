Most of a watchdog's intelligence should be in userspace. However,
it's interesting to put the basic watchdog driver in kernel so that
you have the choice to use any watchdog daemon which will ping
/dev/watchdog. So I think that basically, your driver should turn
any write to /dev/watchdog into a write to 0x1EF.
Now about your concern that there's no way to detect the presence
of the hardware, well, it's already a problem with most such hardware.
I think you don't have to worry about that. Just put a big config
warning, put a message at startup reminding that it will write to
0x1EE and 0x1EF, and that's all.
