What about this (what we'd have on alpha):
int
legacy_ioport_remap(struct resource *res)
{
	switch (res->start) {
	case 0x3c0:	/* VGA */
		res->start += pci_vga_hose->io_space->start;
		res->end += pci_vga_hose->io_space->start;
	case ???
		...
	default:
		return -ENODEV;
	}
	return request_resource(pci_vga_hose->io_space, res);
}
void
legacy_ioport_unmap(struct resource *res)
{
	release_resource(res);
}
Then vgacon.c would be changed like this:
...
-	request_resource(&ioport_resource, &vga_console_resource);
+	if (legacy_ioport_remap(&vga_console_resource) < 0)
+		goto failure;
...
And all in/out port calls would use respective resource.start+offset:
...
-	outb_p(6, 0x3ce)
+	outb_p(6, vga_console_resource.start + 0xe);
No need for other special IO functions then.
Ivan.
