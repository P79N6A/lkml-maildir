(1) you're right, the SCSI subsystem itself uses scsi_malloc(). But I 
wonder, would it be okay to simply replace scsi_malloc() invocations 
with kmalloc of GFP_ATOMIC and GFP_DMA? I mean, to take the relevant
bits out of the 2.5.1-pre11 patch and give it a shot?
(2) you are right again, but fact is that 2.4.x is still being used 
on some production systems for stability reasons (and also because 
the SCSI kernel interfaces in 2.6.x weren't stabilized yet).
More specifically, I've made that patch to be able to connect to 
a large number of iSCSI targets without problems. I wonder if 
there's another way for doing that instead of upgrading to 2.6.x.
