The patch has been modified (courtesy Andi Kleen) to do something a bit 
smarter and only allocate for detected cpus in MADT or MP table. But my 
prime concern was that for_each_cpu didn't work at all during boot.

This should be taken care of using above.

Great, that takes care of my concerns regarding processors which aren't 
enumerated during smp boot.
Thanks for the feedback,
