Do we want to make this sort of source code change?  I thought that
the consensus about the kernel was that we wanted to avoid relying of
implicit includes of <Y.h> by <X.h> -- in this case a better change
would actually seem to be to explicitly include moduleparam.h in files
using module parameters and then remove the include from module.h.
