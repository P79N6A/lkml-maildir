I think I understand the GPL, but I'm not a lawyer :-)

The comparison between proprietary and GPLv3 code is disconcerting and 
strangely funny in this way :-/
What I think *is* new here is that some people would consider GPLv3 a 
logical extension of GPLv2 (in the sense of enhancing freedom), but if 
it turns out that it's so different from GPLv2 that GPLv3 code cannot be 
mixed into the v2 kernel, which does stem from the same philosophy.
I suppose I'll just wait for the next draft and check again...
thanks for the feedback!
