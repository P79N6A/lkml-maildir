I am receiving the following, every 10 minutes:
Subject: Cron <root@pooh>    /sbin/rmmod -as
rmmod: Function not implemented
This is a stock RedHat 6.0 install, with kernel 2.2.7ac4, compiled as a
monolithic kernel. How do I get the module cleanup process (I assume this
is what's going on, since rmmod -as is "remove all unused modules, output
to syslog") to stop running, since there are no modules in the kernel?
Best,
