I'd shoot that down, too.  Using udev in an
embedded, reliable environment is very
troublesome.  Although, products I've
developed using more than 4 UARTs had
some custom /dev work done to it just
to get everything mapped.  My only
concern is we don't add a new range for
QE UARTs, that we use the same minors
for both CPM and QE.
Thanks.
