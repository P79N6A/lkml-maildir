But isn't this a problem with sysfs in general? Restricted process still
observes all devices, busses, etc. through /sys. If such information is
sensitive, shouldn't there be some way to selectively mount only
portions of kobject trees? For example, when file system is mounted, its
/sys/fs/foofs/sb-id tree is mounted in the same namespace. That is, we
need something like
    int sysfs_mount(struct kobject *root, char *mountpoint);
What I am concerned about is that building special foofs-meta
file-system on top of fs/libfs.c for each file-system foofs would lead
to the code duplication, while sysfs/kobjects already have all the
paraphernalia in place.
Nikita.
