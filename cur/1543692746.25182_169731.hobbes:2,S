Neil, the function SVCFH_fmt uses a static variable to sprintf into.
Looks like this variable is declared locally for every .c file
including nfsfh.h, which is quite a few.
You could remove the static, but that would increase the stack usage,
which might be a problem too.  The buffer could be reduced to 64
chars, to reduce that problem.  kmalloc()ing it seems a bit expensive,
but might be an option, too.
Thanks!
Jörn
