Compute is very functional. However it isn't remotely meant to be run on 
a desktop because of very large scheduling latencies (on purpose).

I don't understand your question. Can what be enhanced?

Once again I dont quite understand you. Are you saying that there is 
more than 50% cpu overhead when running 8 processes? Or that the cpu is 
distributed unfairly such that the longest will run for 47s?

Compute mode is by far the most scalable mode in staircase for purely 
computational tasks. The cost is that of interactivity; it is bad on 
purpose since it is a no-compromise maximum cpu cache utilisation policy.
