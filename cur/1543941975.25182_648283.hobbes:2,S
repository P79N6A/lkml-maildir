Yes, it is the central management for these, but also ensures that any
of the sub-drivers have properly locked access to the clocks, gpio and
other shared resources.
The mfd driver for the sm501 exports a number of functions for the
sub drivers to use, you should be able to see what is exported easily
by the fact they are exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). The header
files should document basic functionality of this.

Are you trying to write your own SM501, or something else? It seems
you are writing for something else.
If the chip you are targetting has shared resources, such as clock
gates, PLLs, or gpio that other drivers need to touch, then the best
way to go is for an mfd driver to provide this functionality and have
all the child drivers use the exported functionality.
