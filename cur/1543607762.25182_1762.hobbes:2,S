You can remove it completely. It should not be '#ifdef LATER', but
'#ifdef OLDVERSION'... ncp_add_mem_fromfs was invoked with lock on
ncp_server structure, but then it directly accessed userspace. It was
possible to use this to cause deadlock, so now ncpfs uses bounce buffers
and double copy instead of this.
I have some ncpfs patches, but I though that I'll leave them for 2.5.x.
Maybe it is time to change this decision.
                                            Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
