Why do you feel this way.  We document how to get patches applied very
well (look in Documentation/SubmittingPatches and Documentation/HOWTO),
and provide good review comments on anything that is posted.
We also have a kernel-mentors mailing list that people use to vet their
patches to get them into shape for submission.
So please feel free to submit your patch, especially as without another
LSM user in the kernel tree, the interface will probably go away.
thanks,
