Subject: 2.6.0-test3 XF86Config-4 mouse resolution doesn't work

Hello,
In my XF86Config-4 file, I have my mouse set to use the "Resolution"
option, in order to have faster pointer motion without using
acceleration. This worked fine in 2.4.21, but now that I'm trying out
2.6.0-test3 it doesn't seem to work. That is, changing the value of
"Resolution" has no effect whatsoever. The mouse is slow, like it used
to be in 2.4 before I added the Resolution option.
I know I can use "xset m" to adjust the acceleration, but I very much
prefer to be able to have the mouse constant-speed, yet faster than
default.

forgetting any information that I ought to have included.

into the PS/2 port.
