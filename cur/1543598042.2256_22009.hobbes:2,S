Why not just print out the address of the 'mm_struct'? 
That lets 'ps' treat the address as a cookie, and
thus count the number of occurences of each vm.
This has the additional advantages of:
* moving the intelligence out to the app
* reducing the kernel size, and
* make it easy to find out exactly which processes
are using which vm. (you just search for all occurences
of the cookie).
