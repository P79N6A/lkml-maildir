  We definitely are aware.  I even told the list a week or
  two ago that this is going to happen more and more.
  Those are now coming thru to the list because I decided to
  let even lines looking like majordomo commands to get thru.
  Perhaps I could block AUTH lines.
  This was done because several messages per week got rejected
  when they contained lines smelling too much like Majordomo
  commands.
