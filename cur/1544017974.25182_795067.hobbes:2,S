So the worst-case ping latency is more than 10 times lower?
I'd say this points in the direction of some sort of KVM-internal 
wakeup/signalling latency that happens if KVM does not deschedule. For 
example it could be a bug like this: if a guest image runs at 100% CPU 
time for a long time, IRQ injections might not propagate up until the 
preemption callbacks run. (but i'm just speculating here)
