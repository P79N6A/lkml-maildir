A couple questions:
1) Have you installed the lm-sensors package?
2) What kernel version?
Even with 2.6, you need to install the lm-sensors package, but not the 
i2c package as the kernel already has everything needed in it.  The 
lm-sensors packages contains drivers for all the sensor chips.  After 
you get lm-sensors installed on your current kernel, run sensors-detect 
to get the proper modules loaded for your hardware.
