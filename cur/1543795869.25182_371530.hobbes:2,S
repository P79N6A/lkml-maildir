But on my system gettimeofday uses the TSC and it's still ~35x slower
than RDTSC:
rlrevell@mindpipe:~$ ./timetest 
rdtsc: 10000 calls in 1079 usecs
gettimeofday: 10000 calls in 36628 usecs
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
typedef unsigned long long cycles_t;
#define rdtscll(val) \
     __asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=A" (val))
static inline cycles_t get_cycles_tsc (void)
{
	unsigned long long ret;
	rdtscll(ret);
	return ret;
}
static inline cycles_t get_cycles_gtod (void)
{
       struct timeval tv;
       gettimeofday (&tv, NULL);
       return tv.tv_usec;
}
int main (void) {
	int i;
	cycles_t start_time;
	start_time= get_cycles_gtod();
	for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
		get_cycles_tsc();
	}
	printf("rdtsc: %i calls in %llu usecs\n", i, get_cycles_gtod() - start_time);
	start_time = get_cycles_gtod();
	for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
		get_cycles_gtod();
	}
	printf("gettimeofday: %i calls in %llu usecs\n", i, get_cycles_gtod() - start_time);
	return 0;
}
