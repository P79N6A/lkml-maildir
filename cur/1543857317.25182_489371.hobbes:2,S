well C-states do cause latencies... as advertized in
the /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power file.
You can prevent linux from going into c-states that just take too long,
by setting the latency you can tolerate via the
set_acceptable_latency(). You can see the active maximum latency via the
same power file...
(right now audio playback is the main user of this api; of other parts
should use it too lets talk about it)
