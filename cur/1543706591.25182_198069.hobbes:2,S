Well, I don't know whether my system actually locks up, it is like it 
seems the log gets flooded (when I wait long enough) but I cannot do 
anything with the system at that point, ie it seems like frozen. 
Furthermore I am using latest 53.36 drivers and I am not the only one 
having this problem if I look into nvnews forums. As I said this is a 
problem which came with something changed in the newer kernels. 2.6.1 
(and 2.6.2-rc1) works OK for me, 2.6.2-rc2 and later not.
