Sometimes the functionality would have to be entirely reimplemented to
make it viable for userspace. For FR-V we set aside a condition register
for use in the kernel, so we can emulate ll/sc with multiple-issue
instructions. That can never work in userspace.
We can't just pretend there isn't a problem here.
