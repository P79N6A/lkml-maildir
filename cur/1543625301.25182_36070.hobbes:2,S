Subject: dnotify defines not in headers

How do I get my dnotify #defines which I put in <linux/fcntl.h> into <fcntl.h>
?  I have already recompiled glibc and such as suggested.  I am sure for 
dnotify to be useful the defines must be added to the standard headers.
My kernel builds correctly as does glibc using my new headers (using the 
--with-headers= option).  In fact I remade all the standard headers from 
scratch, wiping out the old ones using the special --with-headers option. 
Still my defines are not being merged into the standard header.
