That's -Os mostly.  Some awful CPUs really need higher
loop/label/function alignment though to get any
performance; you could add -falign-xxx options for those.

You told it to unroll loops, so it did.  No flaw.  If you
feel the optimisations enabled by -O2 should depend on the
CPU tuning selected, please file a PR.
Also note that whether or not it is profitable to unroll
a particular loop depends largely on how "hot" that loop
is, and GCC doesn't know much about that if you don't feed
it profiling information (it can guess a bit, sure, but it
can guess wrong too).
