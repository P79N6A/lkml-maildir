I _should_ have thought of that though, because when this change was 
done originally i had to reintroduce it both for exec-shield and for 
-rt, so apparently it must have triggered in certain circumstances - i 
just didnt notice the reason. (but recent exec-shield and -rt patches 
dont have this revert, so the condition must have gone away. But it was 
a long time ago.)
