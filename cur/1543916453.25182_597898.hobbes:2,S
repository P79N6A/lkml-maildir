Hi,
I am upgrading from kernel 2.6.11 to 2.6.22 on ARM S3C2400A and found
a following issue on 2.6.22.
On 2.6.11, I selected CONFIG_ISA,  CONFIG_NET_PCI and CONFIG_CS89X0 to
build  CS8900A Ethernet driver to kernel, it was running perfect.
But on 2.6.22, I made the same configuration for CS8900A, the cs89x0.o
could not be compiled in to the kernel (or as a module when I tried to
CONFIG_CS89X0=m) unless I commented out depends statement in
drivers/net/Kconfig. I double checked all three are CONFIG_ISA=y,
CONFIG_NET_PCI=y and CONFIG_CS89X0=y. Any explanation please, was I
missing something here?
Thank you.
Regards,
Jim
