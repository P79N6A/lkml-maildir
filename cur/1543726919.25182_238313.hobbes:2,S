OK.  Now I understand.
The main reason that I didn't do something like that is that 
(considering that real time tasks don't get promoted) it would complicate:
1. the selection (in schedule()) of the next task to be run as it would 
no longer be a case of just finding the first bit in the bitmap,
2. determining the appropriate list to put the task on in 
enqueue_task(), etc., and
3. determining the right bit to turn off in the bit map when dequeuing 
the last task in a slot.
As these are frequent operations compared to promotion I thought it 
would be better to leave the complexity in do_promotion().  Now that 
you've caused me to think about it again I realize that the changes in 
the above areas may not be as complicated as I thought would be 
necessary.  So I'll give it some more thought.
Thanks for the suggestion
Peter
