I forgot to mention re this - yes, there's just one caller, in another set of 
patches I'll send later (this was just the first set!). Having the function 
to be inlined in this .h so that it's with other module specific code, and 
then used in the caller once it has been #included, isn't that the right way 
to do things?
Regards,
Nigel
