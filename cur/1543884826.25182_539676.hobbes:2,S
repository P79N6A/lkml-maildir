I mean the mail from Helge Hafting (thread  [linux-dvb] Critical
points about kernel 2.6.21 and pseudo-authorities) at the very first
beginning.

I sent several comments to Uwe to stop flaming, Trent was in the CC
sometimes I never wrote that he should flame on anyone.
I can simply forward you all mails I sent to Uwe there's not one bad mail.
My point is moreover to get that issue sorted out by either accepting
his "proposal" or stating out why not to add it (and there must be a
reason behind it, and no mail which is 2 years old, or explaining what
the device is, again it got explained what's required from you)
seems like your response is based on that misunderstood sentence,
sorry for not beeing clear enough.
