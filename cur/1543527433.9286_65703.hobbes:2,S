This is mostly the input side of it developed by Vojtech. I have been
working on the fbdev side. His patch has some multiheaded support to it. 
After 2.4.X is out we will join forces to find a complete solution :)

The latency issue. The problem is alot of fbdev drivers do everything
pixel by pixel. This is very slow. I have been working on a patch that
makes a standard way for fbdev drivers to take advantage of the accel
engine to preform accel functions.

We are aware that only one scrollback buffer exist for all fbdev drivers.
This does need to be fixed.
