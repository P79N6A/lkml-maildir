if ($_ !~ /^[\(\[\{]/ && $_ =~ /^(\S+)/) {
    print "@@ -a,b +c,d @@ $1\n"
}
So
label:
will be the 'mark[er]' for the @@ line
Just try yourself:
<<< foo.c <<<
int main(void)
{
	x
	y
	z
label:
	a
	b
	c
	d
	e
	f
}
>>>
<<< foo2.c <<<
int main(void)
{
	x
	y
	z
label:
	a
	b
	c
	d
	d+
	e
	f
}
>>>
<<< diff -dpru foo.c foo2.c <<<
--- foo.c       2007-05-30 10:33:45.714222656 +0200
+++ foo2.c      2007-05-30 18:03:43.061471495 +0200
@@ -8,6 +8,7 @@ label:
 	b
 	c
