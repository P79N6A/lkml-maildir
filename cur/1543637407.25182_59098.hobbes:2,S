Not the end, just the start, and not in addition, but only the start
address of each module without any symbol.

valuable for what? you need the system.map or the .o disassembly of the
module anyways to take advantage of such symbol. I don't find it useful.
Furthmore ksymoops will prefer to work with hex numbers rather than
doing the reverse lookup to the number and then resolving to the right
symbol (and not only ksymoops, me too while doing by hand and that's why
I prefer hex there)
One thing is if you have ksymall ala kdb and you can resolve to
something where you don't need the system.map to guess what happened,
but without the ksymall you need the system.map or vmlinux anyways.
