Subject: Patch: 2.0.37pre4

>* Note: There's a weirdness about 2.0.37pre kernels which appears to be
related
>* to some older versions of binutils. If your kernel locks as it boots
please
>* mail me your binutils version (ld -v). It appears at the moment to affect
>* a small number of people only, so Im guessing its an unusual binutils
>* species.
>*
>* With binutils 2.9.1.0.12 life seems to be ok. I'd like to pin down the
>* problem ones to be sure it is a binutils problem.
