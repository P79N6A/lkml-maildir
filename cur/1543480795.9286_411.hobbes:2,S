If you don't open O_NONBLOCK cdrom tries to open the device for data
and fails when no medium is inserted. You should be able to eject
it fine (or issue other ioctl's), as long as you do that. strace of
eject :
open("/dev/hdb", O_RDONLY)              = -1 ERRNO_123 (No medium found)
Whereas
fd = open("/dev/hdb", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
ioctl(fs, CDROMEJECT);
works fine.
