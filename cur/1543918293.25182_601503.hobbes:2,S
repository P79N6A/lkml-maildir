My sign-off got lost when Casey smooshed the patch I sent him into the SMACK 
mega-patch so I'll throw it back in the thread for accounting purposes.

As for SMACK's use of NetLabel - it looks fine to me, especially now that 
there is better preservation of the NetLabel/LSM boundary.  As has been 
discussed on the various lists during earlier revisions of the patch I 
believe there are still some optimizations that can be made regarding how 
SMACK uses NetLabel but that is something we can always work on at a later 
date.
