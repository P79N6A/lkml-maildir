"restrict" exists for this reason. const is only about lvalue.
You should draw a line, not to make C more complex!
Changing the name of variables in your example:
extern print_int(const int *);
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   extern int errno;
   errno = 0;
   print_int(&i);
   return errno;
}
print_int() doesn't know that errno is also the argument.
and this compilation unit doesn't know that print_int() will
modify errno.
Ok, I changed int to extern int, but you see the point?
Do you want complex rules about const, depending on
context (extern, volatile,...) ?
