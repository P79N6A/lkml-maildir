For trivial at least, please split the patches.  It makes it easy for
me and/or Linus to accept only one.
Also, please mention clearly if you obsolete a previous trivial patch...

Like code, descriptions develop scar tissue when you do the "minimally
invasive" change.  Consider this classic trap-for-skimmers from the
glibc "snprintf" man page, and learn:
Return value
       These  functions  return  the number of characters printed
       (not including the trailing `\0' used  to  end  output  to
       strings).   snprintf  and vsnprintf do not write more than
       size bytes (including the trailing '\0'), and return -1 if
       the  output  was truncated due to this limit.  (Thus until
       glibc 2.0.6. Since glibc 2.1 these  functions  follow  the
       C99  standard and return the number of characters (exclud­
       ing the trailing '\0') which would have  been  written  to
       the final string if enough space had been available.)
