I prefer to run stock kernels so I don't have as much
experience with the -aa patches.  However, I took a
look at the relevant code in 2.4.22pre7aa1 and I
believe my patch should help there as well.  The
writepage() and page rotation behaviour is similar to
stock 2.4.22 though the inactive_list is per-classzone
in -aa.  I am less sure about the inode/dcache part
though under -aa.
