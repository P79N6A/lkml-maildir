Hi,
Answering to David:
Well, I have not tried that yet. But that is not a real solution.
You are not supposed to be flushing the cache manualy
(Although it might work as kind of workaround)
the kernel should detect that this is a stale cached entry
and delete it.
Answering to Martin:
Sure for most of the people that's not a big deal.
And yes, you are right: if the tcp connection has
been stablished before playing with routing tables
then everything works just fine.
But, IMHO I thing TCP should not make any assumptions about
routing tables (not even during the stablishment of connection).
So, I personaly see this as a kernel bug.
I understand that this is an "optimization" of the kernel
code, but I thing you should have the possibility of
disabling it.
Regards,
