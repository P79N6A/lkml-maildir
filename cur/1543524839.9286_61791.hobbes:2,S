The constraint is, I have to use 2.2.5 kernel. I can't use any other
kernel.
So, kiovec does the reverse mapping (user memory to kernel) right.
Can it be associated with a device driver like mmap?
Do you think porting is a good idea or follow the lines of kiovec and
implement similar thing for my driver?
Thanks,
Pramodh
