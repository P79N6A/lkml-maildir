Hi Alex,
I was referring to your statement "constant inumbers during the life of
an *open* file" -- it suggests the inumbers may change when the file is
not open.
cpio, tar, cp etc. use stat() to check inumbers to find hard links.  Of
course if inumbers change then they won't find the hard links.
If your implementation provides stronger guarantees then great.

Isn't there problem that if the file is renamed, then leaves the kernel
cache, and is brought back by a later stat(), it gets a different ino?
Thus breaking hard link detection, but nothing else.
