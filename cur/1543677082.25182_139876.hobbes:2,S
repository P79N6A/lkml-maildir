Hi everybody ?
Is there any plans to support aforementioned combination ? I've seen remarks 
in driver sources about unavailability of (sufficient) documentation for this 
chipset - does it means SpeedStep for IBM T20/21 series of laptops will not 
be available ? Or, maybe, some progress is already underway ? How could I 
help ?
