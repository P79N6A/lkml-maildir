Think of PAGs as "session"-style management of credentials. If you
want to add/remove a credential without sharing that operation with
all the other processes that are currently in the same session/PAG
then you change PAGs.
Otherwise, the credential operation affects all processes in the same
PAG.
Under normal circumstances, changing real uid/gid should involve
changing your PAG, but it doesn't necessarily have to do so.
