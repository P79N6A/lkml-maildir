On a PC the lp data port is a single readable register normally living
on a side bus of the PCI chipset (so fast). Just read it and check it
is some specific magic value.

Very, although its harder to check instantly in kernel. I guess you'd have
to put in code that allows key based changing of securelevel via an ioctl

They are simply more fine grained. Chris Evans has found a couple of problems
with the current model but they are fixable
