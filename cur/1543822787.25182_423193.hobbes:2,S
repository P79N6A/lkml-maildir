I suppose so - we're taking the lock with spin_lock_bh(), but it can also
be taken by this CPU from the interrupt, so it'll deadlock.  But lo!  We've
done disable_irq(), so the interrupt won't be happening.
So yes, doing spin_lock_irq() (irqrestore isn't needed in a timer handler)
instead of disable_irq() in vortex_timer() looks OK.
One does wonder how long we'll hold off interrupts though.
