Yes and no.
The thing is, for architectures that care, you can just grep for
"virt_to_phys()". It's basically _never_ the right thing to do on
something like sparc.
My personal preference would actually be to keep "virt_to_bus()" for x86
for now, and undo the change to make it complain. Instead, make it
complain on other architectures where it _is_ wrong, so that you don't
have to fix up drivers that simply aren't an issue. What's the point of
breaking some drivers that only exist on x86?
That, together with a warning and educating more driver writers.
