Let me try to rephrase it:
If you think an open source project does something wrong you have the 
right to fork it and offer an (in your opinion) better version.
This is the right you have.
But if you think open source gives you any legal or moral right to 
demand any featurs or choices or whatever from developers you are 
completely mistaken.

The question how many I/O schedulers we need is anyway in no direction 
related to my patch.
