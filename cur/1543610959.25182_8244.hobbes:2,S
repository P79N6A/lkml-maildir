Hi, all
just tried to compile the mentioned alsa drivers under 2.4.16.
Mixer doesnt work, yes. It compiles, installs, loads. And
any program trying to open mixer (through libasound) get EINVAL.
All is compiled with gcc-2.95.3,
single CPU, with APIC (is any sense to enable it on
uniprocessors?).
Does anybody know what to do about it?
