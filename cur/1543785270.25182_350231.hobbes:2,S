But that implies that there's some piece of code somewhere (could be
userspace, could be kernel) which is doing a timer-based sleep() in between
each CDB.  It shouldn't do that - it should be using the disk
controller's completion interrupt for synchronisation.
What userspace application are you using to write the DVDs, and is it
possible to test a different one?
