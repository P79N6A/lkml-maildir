Only BP should be active at this point. At least not until
we implement IO-APIC hotplug, but so far that isn't there.
Ok in theory the BIOS could have put the other CPUs into
weird states where they are still doing something and causing
interrupts, but that would be a BIOS bug.
I suppose it could happen with kexec, but that has still
other problems anyways.
The common case of no kexec shouldn't be affected at least.
