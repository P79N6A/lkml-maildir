Ouch.  So we somehow got the call of ppa_pb_claim() with dev->cur_cmd being
0x7232b2df, which wasn't a valid address.  Better yet, we've got it from
ppa_attach() and that bugger had just explicitly zeroed *dev out.  And that
bites us only in the built-in case.
Very interesting...  Could you add
	printk("dev = %p, dev->cur_cmd = %p\n", dev, dev->cur_cmd);
right before the call of ppa_pb_claim() call in __ppa_attach(), the
same - right before if (dev->wanted) in the same function and
	printk("dev = %p, dev->cur_cmd set to %p\n", dev, dev->cur_cmd);
right after dev->cur_cmd = cmd; in ppa_queuecommand()?
