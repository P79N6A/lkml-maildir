	Jeff,
	This was discussed publically on this mailing list last
January.
		http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=113710086000009&r=1&w=2
	I made clear at that time that I did not like this change
because the userspace ABI would change, but I was overruled by a wide
consensus. So, don't blame me.
	This change was rediscussed and reconfirmed at the Wireless
Summit. I only tried to make such change smooth, but it was not my
idea.
	Now it's too late, those changes have propagated to userspace
tools, and are now shipping in some actual release of some distro. So,
what are we going to say to Mandriva 2007 and FC6 users, to revert
back to an *older* version of the tools ?
	Because userspace has already been updated, we have only two
options, merge it now, or in 2.6.20.
	Regards,
	Jean
