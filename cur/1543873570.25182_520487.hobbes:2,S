I reviewed Rudolf Marek's patches a few days ago and my first comment
was along these lines:
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2007-March/019169.html
I do indeed believe that the functions in lib/msr-on-cpu.c should be
improved to be suitable for our needs. Others are likely to need the
same feature. Library functions should really return the errors, and
leave it up to the caller to decide whether to ignore them or not,
rather than hiding them.
Could you possibly propose a separate patch fixing lib/msr-on-cpu.c (on
both i386 and x86_64) to reliably report the errors? I guess it's a
simple matter of changing the prototypes of the functions? If we can
get this upstream, this would make the integration of the coretemp
driver easier and faster.
Thanks,
