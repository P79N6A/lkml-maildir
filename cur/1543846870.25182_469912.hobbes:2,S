This seems like The Right Thing (TM) to me, but we need someone from

This seems like a plausible alternative.
The MAC address validation schemes suggested by others would probably
"work", but they would be a bit fragile.  For example, every new vendor
of forcedeth hardware would have a new OUI to be added to the list.
