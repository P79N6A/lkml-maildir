We could add a field to the process struct to record that. (Since PIDs 
can wrap, they can't be relied upon for this).
One potential problem is that we'd race with processes that were 
forking, but that's a problem with the existing implementation anyway.
I can see that the only way I'm going to convince people that we need 
the method I settled on is by showing the deficiencies of the current one :<
