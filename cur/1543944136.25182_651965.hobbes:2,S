Thanks, they are very useful.

Well I did a trial run with the 40 git trees in the latest -mm and got
only 6 conflicts (which actually were not trivial, unfortunately).  Of
course, a lot of them have already been pulled into Linus' tree by now.

I was hoping to be able to automatically find the other tree involved in
a conflict and point both maintainers at the problem.  Also, there is
always the possibility of reordering the trees ;-)

I am hoping (one of Andrew's bugbears) that over time we will end up with
several branches from git using trees (the vast majority) most of which
are completely contained within their own subsystem and don't depend on
anything but Linus' tree.  The conflicting and dependent branches will be
merged later in the sequence.  Thus we will end up with a large amount of
the tree becoming stable as the merge window approaches.  (Yes, sometimes
I am an optimist :-))

I have a couple of lackeys who already do this stuff :-)
Thanks for the comments - I will keep them in mind as I sink into the abyss :-)
