I've done some updates to my autofs hacks:
- the kernel code was not blocking processes from expiring mountpoints, which
means a process may see an inconsistent (partial) tree, and prevent the expire
from finishing properly.  This has been fixed.
- various small bugs in the daemon, most noticably a parsing problem with the
nosymlinks flag (noticed by Joerg Diederich)
Please test and inspect these changes:
