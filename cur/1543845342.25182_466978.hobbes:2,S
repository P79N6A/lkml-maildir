Hi Arnd,
Sorry, I would say I made a logic mistake here. The schedule in the
return_from_int() will only be called when the process steps from the
user space into the kerner space( i.e. sys call). So, what you
described are all correct.
And, we have already had a solution to fix the issue you pointed out.
==================
inline static void default_idle(void)
{
       int flag;
       while (!need_resched()) {
               leds_switch(LED_OFF);
               local_irq_save(flag);
               if ( likely(!need_resched()) {
#if defined (ANOMALY_05000244) && defined (CONFIG_BLKFIN_CACHE)
                     __asm__("nop; nop;\n");
#endif
                     __asm__(".align 64;\n STI %0; IDLE;\n"
                             : %0 (flag): :"cc");
               }
               local_irq_restore(flag);
               leds_switch(LED_ON);
       }
}======================================
Here, according to design, it's not possible that interrupt occurs
between "STI %0"(enable interrupt) and "IDLE".
__asm__(".align 64; STI %0; IDLE;" : %0 (x):  :"cc");
Robin can explain more details.
