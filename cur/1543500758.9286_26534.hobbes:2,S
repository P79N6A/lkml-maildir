mount -o remount,ro on Linux. What was the problem? Indeed you can't do it
if you have files opened for write there (or pending removal of files
from unlinks), but that limitation is reasonable, IMHO.

The *only* way to make it reasonable would be to have a hierarchical
namespace for the options. Otherwise you are just getting the ioctl()
mess, and that's the last thing I'ld like to see.
