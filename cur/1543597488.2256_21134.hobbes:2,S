In short: it doesn't work: it reads 100 while I changed it to 1024 in my
kernel.

Neither RedHat 6.2 (glibc-2.1.3) nor SuSE 7.2 (glibc-2.2.2) works, so what
glibc version are you suggesting?
And suppose I have the right glibc, then the kernel may become a little
confusing:
bash# cd linux-2.4.6
bash# find . -name "*.c" -exec grep -q CLK_TCK {} \; -print
#define   _SC_CLK_TCK             3
./arch/sparc/kernel/sys_sunos.c
#define   _SC_CLK_TCK             3
./arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sunos32.c
#define	SOLARIS_CONFIG_CLK_TCK			7
./arch/sparc64/solaris/misc.c
bash# find . -name "*.h" -exec grep CLK_TCK {} \; -print
#define   _SC_CLK_TCK             3
./include/asm-sparc64/unistd.h
Seems OK for sparc and maybe for solaris, for others it's a mess.
