That's right.  The systems administrator should, and will set
appropriate limits for users on his/her system that apply from login.
This is how the systems I first used were configured (lucky me had a
damn fine sysadmin), and so this is how I configure mine.

I would disagree with this, I believe this is exactly the root of
people's problems with Netscape (and the same theory should apply to
other apps).  The application doesn't know what's _right_ - it knows
what it _wants_.  Big difference.
