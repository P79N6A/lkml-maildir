I've given up on hdparm.  With my generic IDE disk, I get 8 MB/sec, and
about 22 MB/sec if I read from the cache.  With my 7200 rpm SCSI disks (OK,
SCSI-2, not SCSI-3, but still...), I get between 1.8 and 3.5 MB/sec
(depending on wind direction, it seems) reading the disk, and 25 to 33
MB/sec reading the cache (which presumably means it's not the controller
being slower than IDE).
Meanwhile my own informal benchmarks (copy from /dev/xdx to /dev/null) show
the SCSI disks to be slightly faster than the IDE disk, which seems
reasonable.  Are the hdparm numbers from the same school of thought that
gave us bogoMIPs ?
