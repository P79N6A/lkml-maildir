Hi Folks
I have a doubt in Kernel Timers, Can we delete the
Timer with out adding it to the timer List.
What do i mean is with out Doing add_timer() can we
use del_timer(). 
If we can not do that, how do we check whether the
particular timer is running or not. 
Your help will be greatly Appreciated, Please CC me
the Answer as i am not Subscribe to the mailing list.
Thanks in Advance
