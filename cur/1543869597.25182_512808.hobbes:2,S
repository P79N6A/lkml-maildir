OK.
 drivers/kvm/kvm.h         |   13 +
 drivers/kvm/kvm_main.c    |  774 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-------------
 drivers/kvm/kvm_svm.h     |    3 
 drivers/kvm/mmu.c         |   36 +-
 drivers/kvm/paging_tmpl.h |   18 +
 drivers/kvm/svm.c         |   42 ++

 include/linux/kvm_para.h  |   73 ++++
However things might get messy later on if that tree starts introducing changes
outside drivers/kvm.  There's a ton of activity in x86-world.
But if there are problems, you'll hear about it ;)
