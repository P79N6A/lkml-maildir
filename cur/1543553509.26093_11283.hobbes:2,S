i can unserialise the single socket case, but the multiple socket case is
not so simple.
the executive summary is that when you've got multiple sockets you have to
use select().  select is necessarily wake-all.  remember there's N
children trying to do select/accept.  if the listening socket is
non-blocking then you spin in N-1 children; if it's blocking then you
starve other sockets.
see 
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf-tuning.html,
 search for "multiple
sockets" for my full analysis of the problem.

counter-example:  freebsd had wake-one semantics a few years before linux.

Unserialized accept() should be safe (in all versions) and efficient
(in anything vaguely recent) on FreeBSD.
ok, we done finger pointing? :)
