Well, when you think about it, the iorl patch makes lockups less likely,
and when they do occur they are likely to effect a smaller subset of the
scsi subsystem.  When you have one lock and you get a lockup, the whole
system stops.  When you have one lock per device and one lock per
controller, when they deadlock, they only deadlock a subset of the scsi
subsystem.
