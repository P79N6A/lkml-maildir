Subject: Long standing bug in alternate stack handling

Hi,
I just found this out the hard way:
If a signal handler is registered with the SA_ONSTACK flag the
kernel will try to execute the signal handler on the alternate
stack even if no such stack is registered.
This is an explicit violation of Unix98 and probably Posix.
Architectures affected include at least i386 (don't know about others).
     regards Christian
