It's probably a memory, disk, or disk subsystem problem.  Bit #2
in your a's and p's are getting set, giving e's and t's.  I had
a similar problem with letters getting capitalized (bit #5 getting
cleared) that resulted in massive disk corruption.  I decided
it was either a cabling problem or because I had the disk installed
upside-down (label side down).  Replacing the cable and reinstalling
the disk fixed the problem.  I've been running other drives
label-side down with no problem.
a = 0b01100001
e = 0b01100101
p = 0b01110000
t = 0b01110100
You probably only notice these, since 1->5 transpositions would
not cause errors... (ick)
