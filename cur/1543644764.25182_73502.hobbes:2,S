Is there a historic reason why we pre-compute and store the loop device
size instead of re-calculating it each time we do a BLKGETSZ ioctl?
Re-calculating it each time allows you to increase the size of the
backing file if needed while it is in use, and I don't think we actually
get the size of the loop device very often, so it is not a big deal,
especially given the simple calculation needed.
Cheers, Andreas
