1) Please note that the overscheduling problem was NOT caused by HZ being
   high. (I guess you know, I just wanted to point out again.)
2) The kernel can wake up processes immediately, if they blocked on I/O
   before, orif they get a signal, so the interactive feeling does not
   necessarily on HZ. From what I know, the Linux kernel does it that way.
3) There might still be cases where processes should be scheduled ASAP but
   are only on the next scheduler tick. I got some multithreaded (pthreads)
   numerical benchmark which depends on the HZ setting. (At least it did,
   when I last tested (2.2.2 or smth similar), but maybe Ingo has changed
   something soince then.) 
   This is the reason for my HZ=400 on ix86 patch.
