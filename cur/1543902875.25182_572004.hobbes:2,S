Sure. And adding unnecessary checking that doesn't make sense makes bugs 
*more* likely rather than less.

There are absolutely tons of functions that can return errors (or other 
values), and where many users MAY SIMPLY NOT CARE.
I think "must_check" is an abomination. It makes the callee dictate what 
the caller has to do, but dammit, if the callee really "knows" its errors 
are that serious, it should damn well handle them itself.
The whole "sysfs_create_file()" thing is an example of that. If it fails, 
it fails. The caller can't do anythign about it anyway, except perhaps 
print a message.  Why the hell does such a function have the "right" to 
dictate what the user should do?
That doesn't mean that *all* callers migth not care. Maybe some internal 
sysfs routines really should care. But not a random driver.
