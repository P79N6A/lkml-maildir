Paul Davis and Chris Morgan have been chasing down a problem with
xmms_jack and it really looks like this bug, thought to have been fixed
in 2.6.10, is the culprit.

(for more info google "futex_wait 2.6 hang")
It's simple to reproduce.  Run JACK and launch xmms with the JACK output
plugin.  Close XMMS.  The xmms process hangs.  Strace looks like this:
rlrevell@krustophenia:~$ strace -p 7935
Process 7935 attached - interrupt to quit
futex(0xb5341bf8, FUTEX_WAIT, 7939, NULL
Just like in the above bug report, if xmms is run with
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19, it works perfectly.
I have reproduced the bug with 2.6.12-rc1.
