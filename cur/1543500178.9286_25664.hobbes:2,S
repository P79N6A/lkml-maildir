Hello,
I have 2 boxes 2.2.9-ac4, one as NFS V2 client, and one as knfsd server.
The client is a compilation machine. Sometimes, I have failures during
compilation :
/usr/bin/ranlib  libgoutils.a
/usr/bin/ranlib: libgoutils.a: Aucun espace disponible sur le périphérique
			       No space left on device (I guess)
There is obviously no space problem on any of the partitions (whether
local disks or NFS partitions) : between 500 Mo and 2 Go free space
on each of them.
It happens very seldom, and there is no particular output in the log files.
I guess I will be proposed to upgrade to 2.2.10-acx :-)
A+,
