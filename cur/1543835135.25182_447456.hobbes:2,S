http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/testing/patch-2.4.33-rc3.bz2
is only 854 bytes long, and once bunzip2:ed it looks like it's the
incremental diff between rc2 and rc3. Usually the full pre/rc patches
go in testing/ with the incrementals going into testing/incr/.
No big deal, but it would feel better with a proper -rc3 patch there.
