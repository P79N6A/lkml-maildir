This might be silly in your opinion, but it is simply the reality,
especially in the US, but also in Europe we have an increasing madness
in liability jurisdiction. Do you believe that any responsible corporate
lawyer will buy your "with a warning" argument when he is aware of
rulings stating the opposite ?
I talked to very reasonable corporate lawyers about this and they
provided enough prove, that I take this serious. 
Your argument is logical and should reflect common sense, but reality is
different. If we could rely on common sense, we would not have this
discussion at all.
