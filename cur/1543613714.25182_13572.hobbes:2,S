   You apparently don't know what an embedded system does.
   It is a device that uses a processor to perform some
   designed functions. It cannot do something that it
   was not designed to do although it can certainly fail
   to do what it was designed to do.
   If you want to break it, it's easier to hit it with a
   hammer or an axe. There is not any capability to "break in".
   Even if there was, what could you do? Shut off a motor?
   Screw up the ignition timing? Put porn pictures into
   medical images?
   Most embedded systems don't have network capabilities.
   Those that do are like your network printer. It's possible
   to send it junk. It's possible to send 20,000 form-feeds
   so it runs out of paper, but basically, you are just
   creating havoc with something you, or your company, owns.
   There is no way that you can teach your Hewlett-Packard
   printer to become a network rogue and break into the
   Pentagon --regardless of what you send it.
   Embedded systems that perform critical functions such
   as FMS (Flight Management Systems) have a reset button.
   If it's screwing up, and they often do, the pilot not
   flying says some four-letter prayers to be picked up
   by the cockpit microphone, hits the reset switch, waits
   for it to re-boot, and enters everything from scratch
   again --usually the entire day's flight-plan routes,
   taking nearly 1,000 key-strokes. Now, that's an embedded
   system.
Cheers,
