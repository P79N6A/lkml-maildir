Thanks!

Right, it's been fully converted to sysfs.  Just for reference, the 
resultant sysfs tree looks something like:
/sys |
     ...
     |-firmware 
	       |-efi
		   |-systab
		   |-vars 
			 |- BootNext-xxxx-xxx-x-x-x-x *
				|-attributes
				|-data
				|-guid
				|-raw_var
				|-size
			 |- BootCurrent-xxxxxx-x-x-x-x *
			 |- ConOut-xxxx-x-x-x-x-x-x-*
			 ...
			 |- del_var
			 |- new_var 
where xxxx-x-x-x-x-x is the GUID.

Yes, I plan to consolidate as much of the common code as possible soon.
