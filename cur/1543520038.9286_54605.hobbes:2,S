Over the past few weeks I have been testing the lowlatency patch
(lowlatency-2.2.13-A1) on a PIII 500MHz machine with kernel 2.2.13
compiled UP.  The scheduling latencies I have now are +/-200usec max
and are a significant improvement.  To achieve this, additional patches 
have been provided by Andrea Arcangeli, Ingo Molnar, and Jamie Lokier.
There are two remaining holes that I am aware of; the ps2 mouse driver
disables interrupts for 3msec during aux_write_dev (and probably other
functions) which is a bad thing for scheduling latency and the bottom
half patches I have are probably not complete for the SMP case.
Would it be useful for me to create a new lowlatency-2.2.13-?? patch
with the above patches merged in? I could submit it to Ingo and other
interested people for review/approval.  Would it be adviseable to
also create a lowlatency-2.2.13aa6-?? patch, the 2.2.13aa6 bugfix
release seems to have some pretty important patches.
Is it too late for any of this to get into the 2.2.14 release?
