Hi all,
after switching to 2.6.21 the system clock sporadically loses time on my
box (i386, Athlon MP).
It's always around 4.68 seconds and happened 7 times in the last 12
hours.  A simple calculation (2 ^ ACPI_PM_MASK / PMTMR_TICKS_PER_SEC =
2 ^ 24 / 3579545 = 4.686968875) shows: There is almost exactly one
pmtmr-cycle missing.  Could this be caused by a pmtmr-wrap when the
system is in a sleep state?
