That builds OK on ia32, sparc64, ppc64 and, I assume, ia64.
x86_64 has a problem in ipc/util.c:
	int ipc_parse_version (int *cmd)
	{
comes out as
	int 0x0100
	{
due to:
#if defined(__ia64__) || defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__hppa__)
  /* On IA-64, we always use the "64-bit version" of the IPC structures.  */ 
# define ipc_parse_version(cmd)	IPC_64
#else
int ipc_parse_version (int *cmd);
#endif
