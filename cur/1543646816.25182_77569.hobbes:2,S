1 minute universal time or 1 minute gettimeofday time or 1 minute
internal kernel time? 
The current kernels do the last ...
I guess correct would probably be the second ...
While the first is what the user would expect. ;_
Anyway, if you do an usleep(20000) on a 2.4 (with 100 Hz timer), you
probably expect it to sleep two (and not three) ticks, while with NTP
running you can easily get that it took 19998 usec. Or do we really want
it to go off at 39997 us?

Btw, current kernel NTP implementation (at least 2.4, didn't check 2.5
yet, but it looks very similar) is broken enough, that with NTP running,
the time can jump -1us or -2us backward if the 14.318... MHz clock in
the computer goes slightly faster than it should per spec. Errors of
+200 ppm are quite common.
This is quite a problem ...
