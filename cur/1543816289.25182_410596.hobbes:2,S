Thanks,
It's working OK in my test cases: FC1/64 and the customer's RHEL3.  I
just #include <asm/ioctl32.h> and register all my ioctls.  Ugh.
The location of ioctl32.h seems to move from 2.4 kernel to kernel (and
distro to distro??).  Any suggestion how to include in a universal way
and how to detect all the appropriate 64 bit configs for conditional
inclusion w/a 2.4 kernel?  I detest #ifdef'd code but I guess I have to
do that too, or just keep one version around for this specific case :(
Thanks again,
Bill
