Great!
I tested your changes in 2.2.0-pre1 and I'm astonished with a
performance change.
Before, swap files (unlike swap partitions) were not usable at all,
that is, speed was abysmal. With your changes swap files now perform
at about 80% of swap partition performance, exactly as I was
expecting.
Very good work, indeed.
Happy New Year to you and yours!
Happy New 1999. to all the Linux hackers!
