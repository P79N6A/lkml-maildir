Sorry, i was not clear enough....
The system, what i want to debug is RedHat 9.0, with kernel 2.6.15, 2.6.16-*
The syslog server is Fedora, and the syslog to syslog messages is works, but
netconsole to syslog (and netconsole to netcat) is the problem, including
the init-message!
At this time i try to receive with another redhat 9, but it looks like the
netconsole did not working properly for me. :(
Thanks,
Janos
