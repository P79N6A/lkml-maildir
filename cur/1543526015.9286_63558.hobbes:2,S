Hmm, the cardbus stuff doesn't find a single working interrupt for some
reason.. There's no PCI interrupt, and it can't even seem to probe the
ISA irq's. Everything else seems ok, and it does find the actual card,
it's just that the card driver is understandably unhappy about not
having an interrupt allocated to it.
That's a regular TI PCI1131 controller, others have reported that
working. Hmm..
