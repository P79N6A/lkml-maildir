OK. The crash with bootimg implementation was known to have occasional
difficulties when boot got triggered (via panic) while in X -- sometimes 
having the console messed up, and on some occasions even hangs.
How's been your experience - no problems in kexec'ing from X, 
anytime ?

That would be machine_kexec, and the kimage struct, right ?
So far looks ok, though I haven't looked at it critically. One thing that 
that I require was a way to pass information across boots - 
maybe that could be done through command line parameters to the new 
kernel.

I commented out the EM_486 check from the kexec code, and it built
cleanly. I was able to boot a 2-way system with it, though it seemed
to take a while, perhaps more so because I didn't seem to be getting
any of the bootup/startup messages on my console. In one case there were 
some INIT respawning messages that came up. Not sure the fact that
I'm using a serial console matters.
