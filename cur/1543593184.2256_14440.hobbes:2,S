That's what I did, almost. I think you meant root=/dev/rd/0 init=/linuxrc ( with
devfs) though init parameter is made redundant by the new "root change
mechanism" pivot_root.
But the problem still remains. How do I make my /sbin/init run with PID 1 using
initial ramdisk under the new root change mechanism? I don't want to use the old
change_root mechanism since the Documentation/initrd.txt says:
Obsolete root change mechanism
------------------------------
The following mechanism was used before the introduction of pivot_root.
Current kernels still support it, but you should _not_ rely on its
continued availability.
...
This old, deprecated mechanism is commonly called "change_root", while
the new, supported mechanism is called "pivot_root".
