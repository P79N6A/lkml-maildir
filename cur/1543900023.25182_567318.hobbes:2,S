Well, my bookmark is to SUSv3, which I think is equivalent these days?
And that specifically says malloc() or mmap() in the RLIMIT_AS case,
but only malloc() in the RLIMIT_DATA case.  We're wrong either way.

That may be a good argument (though "extremely unlikely to break"s
have a nasty habit of biting).  I'd still say that the contribution
to Committed_AS is more appropriate and more useful here.

Mapped private readonly yes, but vm_stat_account() says
	if (file) {
		mm->shared_vm += pages;
		if ((flags & (VM_EXEC|VM_WRITE)) == VM_EXEC)
			mm->exec_vm += pages;
