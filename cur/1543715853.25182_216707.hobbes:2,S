I would like to tune pdflush so the writeback isn't too greedy, right 
now the system is unusable due to high disk I/O after creating a bunch 
of files. I know, faster disks would be better.. Tuning the writeback 
would also be a nice option, we had it in 2.4 with /proc/sys/vm/bdflush.
Thanks,
Brett
