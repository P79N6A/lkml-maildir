There's a macro trick that adds a pad member after the buffer too, so
that it gets rounded up to the cacheline size:
 > +#define __dma_aligned	  	__attribute__((aligned(ARCH_MIN_DMA_ALIGNMENT)))
 > +#define __dma_buffer		__dma_buffer_line(__LINE__)
 > +#define __dma_buffer_line(line)	__dma_aligned;\
 > +				char __dma_pad_##line[0] __dma_aligned
So that part is OK at least.
