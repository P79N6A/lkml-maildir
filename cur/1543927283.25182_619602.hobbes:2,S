another question: do you feel and see these timer latencies? If unsure 
you can do a timing test from a remote (known-good) box:
   while :; do time ssh testbox sleep 0.01; done
there'll be a fair bit of offset cost and noise, but these fluctuations 
should still be there and should be noticeable.
but i suspect the delays are "real", i.e. caused by timers not firing at 
the right moment and not by some GTOD anomaly. Once you send the debug 
data we might be able to tell more.
