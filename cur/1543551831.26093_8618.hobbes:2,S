OK, it appears your 'restrict' keyword has *nothing* to do with
"constant functions" as gcc implements them.  'restrict' is all about
pointers not being aliased.  A gcc constant function, OTOH, is one
guaranteed not to have any side effects, so its return value can be
cached and reused by the optimizer.  Two completely different things.
And I have no idea if gcc implements 'restrict' or not.  As of 2.95 it
does do type-based alias optimizing, so I imagine at least a lot of the
infrastructure is there.
