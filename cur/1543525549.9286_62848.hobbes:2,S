Subject: Soundblaster broken in 2.3.4[3,4]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The ISA PnP changes to the Soundblaster code between 2.3.42 and 2.3.43
seams to have caused problems with my Soundblaster AWE32 card. If I boot
back to 2.3.42 it works properly again. These problems are present in
2.3.44 as well.
This is what happens when I try to load sb in 2.3.4[3,4]:
#modprobe -k sb
sb_card: No ISAPnP cards found
/lib/modules/2.3.44/misc/sb.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
/lib/modules/2.3.44/misc/sb.o: insmod sb failed
It claims to not find any ISAPnP cards, but during boot isapnp seams to
find my card fine:
#dmesg | grep isapnp
isapnp: Scanning for Pnp cards...
isapnp: Card 'Creative SB32 PnP'
isapnp: 1 Plug & Play card detected total
Like I mentioned earlier, everything works properly if I boot back to 
2.3.42.
I've attached my .config and I can provide more info if needed.
