	Sorry, but you are confusing segments and paging. Segments give you
windows into the *same* linear space. 4G. Paged. Segments don't add a
thing to memory mapping. Yes, it sounds cool - tons of virtual address
space. Not. Unless you are playing with 36-bit space all you can get is a
window into 4G linear address space. To change the mapping you'll need to
flush TLB - it works below segments.

idea.
