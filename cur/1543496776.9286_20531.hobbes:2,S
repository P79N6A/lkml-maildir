More information on my SuSE 6.1/kernel 2.2.9/diald/pppd problem. To recap:

Well it also seems that diald can die immediately after bringing the link up:
Setting pointopoint route for ppp0
running '/sbin/route add 158.152.1.222 metric 0  dev ppp0'
SIGCHLD[5]: pid 2646 system, status 0
Establishing routes for ppp0
running '/sbin/route add default metric 0  dev ppp0'
SIGCHLD[6]: pid 2647 system, status 0
Then diald disappears.
OK. I captured the routing table under various circumstances. Here goes:
Before diald has started up (note pristine routing table):
jove:~ # netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface

While diald is running but link has not been brought up yet (note THREE sl0
routes - there should only be two created by diald: one default and one
point-to-point):
jove:~ # netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface

After diald has brought up the link (note THREE ppp0 and THREE sl0 devices).
NB. ppp is configured to set itself up as a default route because if you don't do
this then diald doesn't bring up the link.

After diald has been manually shut down again (note the one of the point-to-point
sl0 routes doesn't go away when it should).

When diald dies unexpectedly, even if pppd is brought down, it fails to clear any
of the sl0 routes.

I found the following posting on the linux-kernel list. It clearly points the
finger at some reckless changes in the 2.2 kernel:

However this doesn't explain why I get THREE sl0 interfaces. And I don't know how
to use this information to fix the problem anyway. I don't know what I have to
change to get the routing to behave. My own /etc/route.conf is innocuous. It
contains only this line:
192.168.0.0             0.0.0.0                 255.255.255.0           eth0
Can somebody figure this out for me? Per Yoda's dictum, I promise to pass on
whatever I learn from this.
