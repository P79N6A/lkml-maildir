hpa,
I'd remove the __BIG_ENDIAN test cases if I were you. Having written
many a iso9660 decoder I will tell you that the "required" bi-endian
implementation is sometimes broken as many vendors only test CDs with a
certain single endian OS. I've seen these set to 0s, or -1 or just a
copy of the le data byte for byte. I opened many a bug report with the
different CD formatting software vendors, some fixed them, many didn't
care. The extra savings does not justify the hassles IMHO.
The other changes look great!
