It depends on the card model. The chipset (S3 Virge) does not give a
damn about Vesa, this is a bios matter. My S3V card is fairly recent
(three months old) and includes a Vesa 2.0 bios. My older (1995) S3 Trio
64 V+ does not. But I know one S3 Trio 64 V+ that does include such a
bios.
It is possible to patch arch/i386/boot/video.S so that it prints out at
boot time which version is present. I have not this patch handy, but it
is simple (it requires some knowledge of i386 assembly though). If I
have some time, I will do it again and post it on the list.
