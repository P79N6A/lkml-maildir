... and by the same logics you should make fsck implement its own
drivers - after all, right now b0rken driver affects both the kernel
ext2 and fsck ;-)
I'm not sure that fsck of fs mounted read/write is worth doing in the
first place, but I'd rather do that via fs/ext2 exporting its metadata
explicitly than by playing silly buggers with device/fs coherency.
