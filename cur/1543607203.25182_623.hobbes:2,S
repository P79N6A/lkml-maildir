What is the intended behavior of poll within a module when
two or more tasks are sleeping in poll? Specifically, when
wake_up_interruptible is executed from a module, are all
tasks awakened or is only one? If only one, is it the
first task to call poll/select or the last, which is awakened
first? 
Cheers,

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
