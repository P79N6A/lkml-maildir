Well, the timing data _I_ would be interested in would be pure data, no  
code. Indeed, *please* no code. Code is slow.
What I's want is something like this:
struct {
        int jiffies;
        int jiffies_per_second;
} timing_data;
Then, I can do stuff like, say,
int interval = jiffies_per_second / 10;
for (;;) {
        if (abs(oldjiffies-jiffies)>interval1) {
                printf("\rRecord = %d", recno);
                oldjiffies = jiffies;
        }
        /* do something long, with fast iterations */
}
or
int interval = jiffies_per_second / 2;
struct tm current_time;
void make_current_time(void)
{
        static int last = 0;
        time_t t;
        if (abs(last-jiffies)<interval)
                return;
        last = jiffies;
        time(&t);
        current_time = *(localtime(&t));
        return;
}
