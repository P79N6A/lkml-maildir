yes, I'm very much in "slow things down, do it more carefully" mode.  I
have 350 patches sitting awaiting later consideration at present.
It's not so much that I'm personally swamped - it's more that I think we've
hit (exceeded) the rate at which we can feed stuff into the tree while
maintaining acceptable quality.
If others were to increase the amount of time they spend on testing,
reviewing and bugfixing it would help to level things out. 
I should have got the 2.6.22-mm-merge-plans email out a week or two
earlier, I'm afraid.  Things are looking somewhat messy.
