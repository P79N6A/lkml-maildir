Probably. There is something flaky in ACPI event (it happened sometime
between 2.6.7 and 2.6.9, i tried to check all the patches, but I had find
nothing. 
Could someone please check 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4124
 and
tell me what to do to help in debugging it? 
What is very strange is why "power button" and "read battery current capacity" 
events are working ok, and "sleep button" or "CRT switch button" or "ac
plugged/unplugged" seems more or less random delayed.
