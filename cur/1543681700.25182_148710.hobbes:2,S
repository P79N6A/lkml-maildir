I don't think it's an issue on 32M only, my point was that it's still a
relevant amount of ram on 64M and 128M boxes too and it may be more than
what the VM allows to be dirty in those ram setups (even with the
default sysctl), especially during vm congestion that is when you most
need to dominate the amount of that locked ram.
