Yes. They are much easier to use from a practical standpoint. They do
not require repartitioning of your drives. They are easy to back up
using rsync. They are reasonably easy to resize (by creating another
file-backed loop side by side and copying the data).
Probably the biggest reason is that repartitioning laptop drives is a
difficult task. You can't just connect a second drive to a laptop, so
when you have a laptop that's full of data, there is no easy way to
repartition.
All in all, it's not a strict requirement, it's a convenience thing,
especially for those of us who do not sit in front of huge desktops,
where you can easily add and replace drives.

I have used cryptoapi (as modules) for the last 2 years (or so) now,
without encountering any problems whatsoever. I therefore beg to differ:
if the same deadlocks are there, then for some reason they are not
triggered on my machine. Two years versus an hour, that's a rather
significant difference in terms of reliability.

I would humbly suggest that this annotation be made more explicit. Had
it said "DO NOT use file backed loop devices, as these do not work and
cause deadlocks", I would have never even tried loop-AES. As it stands,
I did, and it took about an hour to get a deadlock.

PS: just as a clarification: my setup consists of reiserfs on top of an
encrypted file-backed loop device, the file sits on an ext3 fs mounted
with data=ordered.
