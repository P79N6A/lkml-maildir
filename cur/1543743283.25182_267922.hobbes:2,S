That seems to be the only kind of dead processes I get, and thats not 
too often.  Booted to 2.6.10-rc1-bk11 now, its all working just fine 
except for on messydos patch that finally must have made it into the 
tree.
As it appears I do not have a prayer of convincing folks otherwise 
about this issue, I suggest we let this thread die a well deserved 
death till it bites me or someone else again.  I'll summerize that 
os9/nitros9 handles this situation effortlessly and flawlessly, and I 
expected a 150x more sophisticated os to do likewise.  My mistake.  
OTOH, its one hell of a versatile os IMNSHO.  I'm not going away just 
because it bites me occasionally.
