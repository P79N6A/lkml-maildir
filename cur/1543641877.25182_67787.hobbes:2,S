Linus will be the final arbiter of taste here. I've largely said my
peace, but will step forth from the shadows long enough to say the
decision here (and dear gawd, this is a trivial issue) hinges on this:
(1) one may describe the data structure as accurately as possible, so
	struct list_marker, struct list_node, or (gawd forbid)
	struct list_head is the proper name in this context.
(2) brevity is the soul of wit, and the rest may be assumed to be the
	burden of knowing how to program, so struct list must be
	twisted a very small bit so it's understood this is a list node
	and/or head when the abbreviated name is used.
At this point, I beg of you all, defer to Linus and produce useful
things instead of debating this kind of issue endlessly. It's basic.
It's fundamental. It's trivial. And it's his kernel. Yes, I'm
authoritarian, and no, I'm not in charge. These simple things are too
easy to debate. The real coding lies elsewhere. Now let's move on please.
Thanks,
Bill
