Bad EXTRAVERSION naming on my part.  2.5.62-mm2 _was_ booted with 
elevator=cfq.
How it happened:
2.5.61-mm1 tested
2.5.61-mm1-cfq tested and elevator=cfq added to boot flags
2.5.62-mm1 tested (elevator=cfq still in lilo boot boot flags)
Then to test the other two schedulers I changed extraversion and boot
flags.

AFAICT, that's the one request in over 500,000 that took the longest.
The numbers are fairly consistent.  How relevant they are is debatable.

2.5.62-mm3 or 2.5.63-mm1?  (-mm3 is running now)
