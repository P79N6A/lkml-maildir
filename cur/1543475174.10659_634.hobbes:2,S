Hi all.
How I can make tcpdump (preferrable, but other packet sniffer may be
helpful) work in 2.2.0pre*?
I've getting the following message:
tcpdump: snoop socket: Socket type not supported
Also, my DEC 21140 network card is telling me the following:
fox:/root# ifconfig eth0
eth0     Link encap: Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:E8:24:7A:38
           inet addr:1.5.112.0  Bcast:1.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0
           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
           RX packets:2175 erros:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:1
           TX packets:0 errors:18745 dropped:144 overruns:0 carrier:0

fox:/root# lsmod
Module      Size  Used by
tulip       25076   1
fox:/root# _
I can ping, telnet, browse, etc.
Is there something i forget to do or something i need to do? I've enabled
the full-duplex of the card.
The configuration is basically the same as 2.0.36 (and work in this).
Thanks in advance.
