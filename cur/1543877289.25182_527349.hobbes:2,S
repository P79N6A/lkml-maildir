Also you may want to switch off slab merging. That will allow you to 
determine the cache involved if its not a kmalloc alloc and the slab was 
merged.
Note that switching off merging may seem to cure the problem because 
the object was corrupted after allocation and then the slab was never 
touched again. It may surface only if its merged because merging creates 
more activity on the slabs that will expose the problem.
