You seem to be freely switching between describing the targeted and
strict policies here (the link is describing targeted and your example
implies strict), ending up with a description that is not accurate for
either. On a targeted FC5 system httpd_sys_content_t works for users web
pages and SELinux makes no attempt to limit the editing of the files by
the users because they are unconfined. Users are, of course, still
subject to DAC permissions.
With a strict policy it is a simple matter to label user web pages with
httpd_user_content_t (see below) and system web pages with
httpd_sys_content_t and have SELinux determine which users can edit the
system web pages by role. I don't see how the same could be accomplished
with App Armor, so it is strange that you are trying to portray this as
a weakness in SELinux.

I'm not certain where you came up with this straw man, but arguing that
SELinux is hard because things don't work when you label user's public
html files with types not intended for that purpose is somewhat
surprising.
Following the directions in the faq entry you link to on a FC5 system
works perfectly well for me. Not certain why you are confused about
whether users are allowed to do this relabeling since the faq explicitly
shows how to do this and includes an example session where it
successfully works. As for which applications can edit that type a) most
user applications are unconfined so they will work and b) the question
is easy to answer with any policy analysis tool like Apol or examining
the policy manually.
I would also note that no policy development was needed to enable user
web pages, which I think much easier regardless of how simple the policy
language 
If you want to know why SELinux does not support multiple contexts per
object (by design) there is a long discussion start at
http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/list-archive/0501/thread_body50.cfm.
