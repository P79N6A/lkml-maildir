It appears as Button4 (click) and Button5 (spin).  xterm will use them for
scrolling - see /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.
My ergonomic Logitech MouseMan has a fourth button that X currently seems
to think is a second button 2.  Must (a) fix that and (b) figure out a use
for it.
BTW, if someone's working on the console driver, why don't you implement an
ioctl() that will copy the current selection to/from a buffer, so that you
don't have to trigger a paste and try to figure out where it ends?  I've
thought about this a couple times in the last few years, and it'd make a
gpm<->X cut buffer gateway much easier.
