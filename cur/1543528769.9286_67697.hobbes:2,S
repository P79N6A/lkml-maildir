I've already submitted a similar patch (except it allowed selection
of the multicast/unicast address through ioctl).
Alan Cox decided that the address selection should be made
on a per packet basis to reflect the broadcast/directed status
of the packet. (so my patch was rejected).
I looked at doing this, but currently the rest of the networking
code (upper layer) does not currently handle selection of this
address if IFF_NOARP or IFF_POINTOPOINT is set for the
device (which both are set for syncppp).
Alan stated that he wanted to do it 'right', which I take to mean
reworking the upper layer to make the correct address selection
for this case. He seems busy right now so I don't know
when this will change.
