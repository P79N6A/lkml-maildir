This is what the adaptive patch set does.  All current spinners exit the
loop on an owner change.  
In this case each "spinner" will traverse the outer rt lock loop and
re-attempt to acquire the lock.  If unsuccessful, the task will re-enter
the adaptive wait loop again, providing that there are still "timeout"
iterations left for that particular task. 
I do have some stats on the rt lock/adaptive algorithm from a crude
patch used during development.  As Bill has noted, the correct way to
obtain these would be to extend lockstats.  It was just more expedient
to create this crude patch at the time.  If it is helpful to look at
these results in the meantime, I can easily make them, as well as the
patch, available.
