This wouldn't be the first time this week I've read this part of
page_launder wrong, but I don't see a difference between a NULL writepage
func, and a writepage func that returns 1.  I read the code like this:
if(PageDirty(page)) {
...
	if (!writepage)
		goto page_active ;
...
	result = writepage(page)
	if (result != 1)
		continue ;
	SetPageDirty(page);
	goto page_active ;
}
