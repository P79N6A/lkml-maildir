could you enable latency timing and tracing in the .config:
 CONFIG_CRITICAL_PREEMPT_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE=y
and start a new search for a maximum latency via:
 echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
and then do the X test - what is the largest latency reported in 
'dmesg'? Also, please send me a (bzip2 -9 compressed, if too large) 
/proc/latency_trace trace output of the largest incident.
