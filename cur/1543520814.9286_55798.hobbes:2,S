I would really like to see that patch go into the main distribution... It
seems I've run into the problem several times, and I definitely don't
think an infinite loop is desirable behavior.   
Is there any disadvantage to putting a limit on the the number of
concurrent modprobe's run by kmod?  Certainly on a heavily modularized
system the number may be higher... However couldn't the limit be set to a
reasonably high number, which wouldn't occur under heavy module load, but
would occur under a circular dependency loop?
Just my opinion.... Thanks for listening.
