Yes.
Story is like this:
I was using Fedora 8 on my machine with one hard disk, So I was
planning to add another OS 'Rock Cluster 5.1', so I added another
working drive as primary slave and start loading Rock cluster 5.1
during installation machine reboots so when I log on to Fedora 8
machine I get uncorrectable error, I thought may be somehow this drive
is broken so I connected another drive as primary slave and I also
verified that it is mounting on Fedora 8 and also showing correct
data.
So I again started Rock Cluster frontend installation , I did manual
partition on hdb and during format it shows me unrecoverable error. So
when I started Fedora 8 it also show uncorrectable error on another
drive also.
So I am still trying what goes wrong.

I am attaching dmesg because from /var/log/messages because dmesg is
clipping data and also attaching config file.
