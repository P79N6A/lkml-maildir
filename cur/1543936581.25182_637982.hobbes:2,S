Yes, that is a usual bug/problem in common distributions[0] as there is
no real guarantee that your clock is not far off.
Add your timeservers in /etc/ntp/step-tickers whereever your
distribution looks into to decide if ntpdate should run or activate the
ntpdate init.d script.
And some distributions run `ntpdate` quite late BTW ....

That the reason to activate `ntpdate` unconditionally: It sets the
current time to an (somewhat) accurate value and `ntpd` handles the
rest.
