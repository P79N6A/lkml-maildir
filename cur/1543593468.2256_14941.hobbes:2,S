Actually, I suspect apm.c is at fault here. Suspend works,
which proves that the PM code in apic.c and nmi.c works.
But note how apm.c:send_event() ignores standby events and fails
to propagate them to PM clients. Thus, Remi's box will have an
activated local APIC and live NMI watchdog when the APM BIOS
finally gets to do whatever it does at standby.
It is fatal to have an active local APIC and NMI watchdog at suspend,
and I can only assume that this is true for standby as well.
Please try changing apm.c:send_event() to propagate standbys to PM
clients just like suspends. Does this fix the problem?
(Any why use standby in the first place? Any reason you don't
want to / can't use suspend?)
