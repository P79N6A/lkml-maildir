These symbols are getting in there anyways.  "nm vmlinux" shows:
00000000 a EBX
00000000 a state
00000001 a CF_MASK
00000004 a ECX
00000004 a flags
00000008 a EDX
00000008 a sigpending
0000000c a ESI
0000000c a addr_limit
0000000c a addr_limit
0000000c a addr_limit
00000010 a EDI
00000010 a exec_domain
00000014 a EBP
00000014 a need_resched
00000018 a EAX
00000018 a tsk_ptrace
0000001c a DS
00000020 a ES
00000024 a ORIG_EAX
00000026 a ENOSYS
00000028 a EIP
0000002c a CS
00000030 a EFLAGS
00000034 a OLDESP
00000034 a processor
00000038 a OLDSS
00000200 a IF_MASK
00004000 a NT_MASK
00020000 a VM_MASK
most of these are from entry.S.  They are grepped out when we create
System.map.

The point is that we let gcc/ld take care of these offsets by itself
instead of hacking up an external program (which complicates
cross-compiling) to extract them.
