Well, the thing is, if we ever do want to support it (and I suspect we 
do), we should have the infrastructure ready. It shouldn't be too hard to 
support SMP suspend in a 2.7.x timeframe, since it from a technology angle 
looks like simply hot-plug CPU's. Some of the infrastructure for that 
already exists.
But I seriously doubt we want to do CPU hot-plug as a device driver. 
Having a hook in place for it in the arch directory will make it easyish 
to add once we integrate all the other hotplug code (which is very 
unlikely in the 2.6.x timeframe).

Sounds reasonable to me. In fact, it looks like it really already exists
as the current "restore_processor_state()" thing.
In fact, that one already _does_ call "enable_sep_cpu()", so what's up?
