IMHO vgacon is at the top of the list of modules that should get cleaned
up 'the right way'.  I am definitely interested in having multi-head
with VGA cards, and getting vgacon to play nice with that sort of
situation is something I am looking at.
Anyway, for whoever does the vgacon update, it should clean itself up
too:

I like this approach much better, especially since the data structure is
much more generic and flexible than before.  I can use it for mmio or
pio resources, store arbitrary data, etc.
'flags' in 'struct resource' should be renamed to 'data'.  That makes it
more clear that the entire long is available for usage by the driver. 
It might be a pointer to an additional data structure for example.
