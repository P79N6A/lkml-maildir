          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Then why does it (presumably) prevent
	people from using there equipment .  Otherwise there is no
	point in making alot of noise over a simple message .
	I still beleive that a manually setable value s/b available,
	ie: at boot: or lilo.conf/... time .  If it prevents usage .

	Spewing a message about it is OK .

	Why, Not all those overclockers are kernel hackers they may be
	hardware geeks .  Not everyone in the world knows kernel level
	hacking & not everyone who is a kernel hacker knows -every-
	idiosyncracy of hardware .
