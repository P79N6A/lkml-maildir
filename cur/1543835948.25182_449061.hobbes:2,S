Sorry Dave,
The delay on that issue is my fault.  While Dan is an Intel employee,
he's in a totally separate part of the company (and a different state)
from me and the other networking folks.
I was trying to determine if reordering so that the spin_lock was inside
the lock_cpu_hotplug would work, or if something else was needed, Dan
suggested making the net_dma_event_lock a mutex, but then as Andrew
pointed out as long as a lock is being held preemption is disabled and
we're safe from cpu hotplug.
Simple patch to remove the lock_cpu_hotplug/unlock_cpu_hotplug calls as
Andrew suggested coming up.
