No effect on my init segvs.  BTW, even #define'ing _PAGE_GLOBAL to
zero doesn't help, and I still see the problem when booting with
maxcpus=1, so it's definitely not a cross-cpu TLB invalidation problem
(and the individual invlpg() calls you previously had in the kmap code
should affect even global pages on a single CPU system, shouldn't
they?)
