How is a buffer overrun in a script/application less "harmless" with IMA? 
Please be specific. Preliminary IMA patches are out on the mailing lists.
The only thing that IMA does with respect to existing known buffer 
overruns is that it enables remote parties to know that there is an application 
with a known buffer overrun if this application/script was measured. Such 
information is sensitive and this is one reason why direct access to the 
measurements are restricted to authorized/trusted parties.
Thanks
Reiner
