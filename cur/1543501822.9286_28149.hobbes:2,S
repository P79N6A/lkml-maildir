Subject: Slooooooow iozone on IDE with 2.2.5-2.2.10

Hello,
As usual, I have tried to run iozone on my local IDE hard disk and got
very bad results. Running 'iozone 200 8192 /tmp/zz' gives the low
figures à 2 Mo/s writing and 4 Mo/s reading, with kernels ranging
from 2.2.5-22 (RH 6.0 kernel) to 2.2.10-ac8.
These figures are bad, but worse is that during writing, the entire
machine seems frozen (under X, nothing is refreshed during seconds,
even the mouse does not mouve). On the console login, I can not
even log. Once iozone is starting reading, things are a little better.
I do not remember having had that bad performance in the time of
RH 5.2 with 2.0.36 kernel. If I remember correctly, I had around
9+ Mo/s writing and 7+ Mo/s reading.
I have much better results with a Tekram 390F UW card (15 Mb/s writing,
10 Mb/s reading), with no real interactive response loss.
