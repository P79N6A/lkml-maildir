Hi Andi,
Here's a little batch of cleanups:
 - re-enable VDSO when PARAVIRT is enabled
 - make the parainstructions symbols match the
   other altinstructions naming convention
 - add kernel command-line options to disable altinstructions for
   smp and pv_ops
Oh, and I'm mailing your noreplacement patch back at you, for no
particularly good reason.
