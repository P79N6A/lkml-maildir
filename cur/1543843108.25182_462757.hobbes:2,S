the header file <asm/unistd.h> that used to provide the necessary _syscallX()
macros doesn't do that any more. You can still use your own copy of the
macros though, like every libc does internally.

char *pathname = "/tmp/dir";
int mode = 0644;
int result;
__asm__ volatile ("push %%ebx ; movl %2,%%ebx ; int $0x80 ; pop %%ebx"
	: "=a" (result)

Understanding that inline assembly in detail is beyond what most people
do at university, but interesting nonetheless.
