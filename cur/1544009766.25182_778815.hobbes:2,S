Actually now that I'm starting to wrap my head around it I think it
might be the fact that I call
idr_get_new_above with 64, then later with 0. I'm not sure the new
code is dealing with that case so
well.
We don't do that in the standard kernel tree yet, so it explains why
nobody's noticed, however the KMS
changes introduce it, and we have those in f10.
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git;a=blob;f=drivers/gpu/drm/drm_stub.c;h=5ca132afa4f2e128999e319e44e31ad156e6ab74;hb=drm-next
is the drm_stub.c from drm-next that will trigger the issue.
Again I'm not sure if this is a legal use of idrs.
Dave.
