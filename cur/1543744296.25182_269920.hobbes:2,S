seems mostly correct. The issue is that if a wakeup is done from within
an irqs-off critical section (perfectly possible - a simple printk can
trigger a wakeup) then the current task may be marked for rescheduling
but cannot do it just yet. So when interrupts are re-enabled again
(outside of a critical section) a manual preempt_check_resched() is
necessary in the generic case, or else we miss the reschedule.
In special cases, if no wakeup may happen from within the irqs-off
section then the manual preemption can be skipped, because asynchronous
reschedules (e.g. on SMP) always come in the form of interrupts. I'd
wager that in fact these 'special cases' are in the majority, but
there's no guarantee.
