i addressed this when you first raised this issue (back in the ktimers 
flamewars), and generally the feeling of people i asked was that doing 
the container_of() approach is less readable than an explicit 'data' 
field. It also deviates from struct timer_list, which we wanted to stay 
close to. Furthermore, for standalone hrtimers this creates the need to 
generate a wrapper structure. So i dont really like this change - but no 
strong feelings either way.
