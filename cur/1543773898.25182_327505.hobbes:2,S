look at the CPU# column, we have trace entries from both CPU#0 and CPU#1 
- and both of them are delayed by 200 usecs! The CPU#0 delay happened in 
the idle thread, between preempt_schedule() in __schedule() and 
_raw_spin_lock in __schedule(). It's a codepath where there's no 
spinning done. The CPU#1 delay happened in the wmResh process, between 
__up_mutex()'s entry and the first _raw_spin_lock() it did. This too is 
a codepath where no spinning is done. (and even if there was spinning, 
the two locks are not the same.)
in other words, since there is no OS-level explanation for the delay, 
this can only be an effect of the hardware/system. (Or it could be a bug 
in the measurement, but the likelyhood of seeing a 200 usec bump in the 
measurement is quite small.)
