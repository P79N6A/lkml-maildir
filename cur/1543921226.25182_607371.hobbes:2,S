kvm.git is actually 2.6.24-rc, pulled from -linus at a random point in
time, so it's not at all surprising if something is broken.
One option is for you to pull -linus to get the latest and hopefully
greatest and see if the bug is fixed.
Another is to use the external module capability to build kvm.git
against 2.6.23.1.
