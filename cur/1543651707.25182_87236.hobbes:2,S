Was this just to cover the possibilities or do you know of such? I guess
all system which build kernels have QT, it won't build without it :-( I
know that's going to be fixed RSN.

That's not likely, but perhaps all the groups which have or want a GUI
could define a standard interface which could go in the kernel, and then
any GIU could interpret the metadata from that and display it any way they
want.
Just a thought, I have no axe to grind, menuconfig is the only thing
reasonable to config remote machines. Any GUI over ssh over somewhat slow
open net connections is vastly unproductive.
