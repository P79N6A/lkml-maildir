I know I'm replying to my own message, but it took from Monday to
Thursday to come back via the list!
Now, unfortunately, I get so many oopses followed by a spontaneous
reboot on 2.3.3-ac3 (ISDN included) when connecting to the Internet
that I can't begin to debug it. Not a sausage is left in the logs
either due to the reboot happening before a sync.
One thing: the process named in the "oops" as it flashes by is
totally bogus (full of graphics characters, etc.) so maybe I
miscompiled something, though the compilation went off without any
bother at all.
