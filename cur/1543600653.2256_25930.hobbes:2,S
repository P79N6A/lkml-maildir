Subject: Plaguing ATAPI Tape drive errors in kernel 2.4.x

Hello,
I have been using a Seagate ST20000A (10GB/20GB) ATAPI tape drive since kernel
2.2.x.
This tape drive worked flawlessly as an IDE tape drive in kernel 2.2.x (up to
2.2.18).
When I upgraded to kernel 2.4.4, it failed as an IDE tape drive. It was
recommended to me that I use SCSI emulation to "fix" the problem. I did this and
although I got profuse SCSI errors on the console during tape operations, the
operations seemed to work anyway (perhaps the errors were non-fatal). I had
posted these errors with no replies or suggestions.
Now as I try kernel 2.4.9, nothing works. SCSI emulation no longer works. I get
a failure as soon as it attempts to write the tape. I have had to go back to
2.4.4 as a result. I did not attempt to go back and try IDE again on 2.4.9.
I scanned the mailing list archive and found one other person who seems to have
the same problem, but no solutions have been posted. Any ideas?
Thanks.
