I am not trying to reinvent SELinux. But I do not know how to accomplish what 
I want with SELinux.
Here it is what I want:
- have security labels applied to sockets based on their owners (ok, I guess 
SELinux does this by default)
- the security labels of processes be assigned based on their executable's 
inode+mountpoint.
Is there a way to do auto-labeling with SELinux? I mean having a security 
context applied based on the inode, without me having to run 'make relabel', 
setfiles, and so on....
Let's say I compile&install a program. Can it have a security label 
auto(magically) applied, based on the inode of its executable? (without 
recompiling, & reloading the policy)
(From my very limited understanding of SELinux, this would mean creating a 
context for each executable, that is altering the policy, if each executable 
needs to have a separate context. Is it possible to dinamically generate the 
context at runtime? Is it possible to integrate my autolabel.c with SELinux?)
It doesn't have to have a security label applied by its inode, but that is 
unique, I don't know how secure would it be to identify processes by path...
If the above is possible, could you please provide pointers to documentation?
How can I implement auto-labeling with SELinux? (is there a possibility to 
write some sort of plugins that provide this functionality?)
To sum up, I wrote my LSM stuff because I didn't know how to use SELinux to 
accomplish what I wanted. 
If it can be done with SELinux easily, I'm happy to switch to that. (easy from 
the end-user's perspective, using fireflier for example. it doesn't matter 
how much work it would imply to make fireflier handle the stuff "behind the 
scenes")
Thanks in advance,
Edwin
