This was my recommendation as well.
Using a work queue not only solves this locking problem, but it also 
enables the possibility of sleeping, a common operation during the 
hardware resets that often occur during ->tx_timeout()
Anyone who wants to make this change in a driver, don't forget that this 
could race with other operations, notably dev->stop() or suspend.
