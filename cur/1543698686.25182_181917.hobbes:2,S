It's CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD, in the kernel.  But the behavior I noticed
is, with that kernel option, system assigns hda for the first disk on
the second controller (Promise here, not HPT, but that shouldn't matter
at all), and the drives on the motherboard controller get hde and so on.
Is OP sure that kernel really doesn't see the drives at all?  And
ofcourse if turning off CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD in the kernel fixes the
problem...
