Hi,
I just compiled 2.2.13 and found that the kernel would not uncompress at
boot time ("Out of memory").
I notice that 2.2.13 changes the gzip compression level from 9 to 3. It seems
that this change causes gunzip() to use more memory.
I changed the compression level back to 9, and the kernel was able to boot
again. Is this the correct "fix", or should I be increasing HEAP_SIZE in
arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c (or neither :-)?
Many thanks for your help,
Julian
