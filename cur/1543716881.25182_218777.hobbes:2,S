It also might be a "memory location" that isn't really in memory (a local
variable whose value resides in one register up to your asm() fragment, and
from then on in another one or in memory; it might also be useful to load a
value into a register from memory and restore it into memory after sundry
manipulations, and even from a different register, much later).
Today's compilers don't necessarily do things the way a naive understanding
of the source language would say they do. Ever wonder why nobody uses
"register" anymore (compilers are smarter than binding one value to a
register today), and why fiddling with pointers when accessing arrays is
not standard fare (compilers optimize the (bulky, slow) array accesses via
indices out as a matter of course)?
