I had the same problem with an ACER 8101 WLMI. I reverted the initialization
partly and it works now, but I don't know if it really fixes the bug.
Something seems to wrong in the pci initcode.
But other hardware errors with the acer notebook still remain. The detection
of the ioapic results in a deadlock in the boot process (the
multiple-ioapic-fix or "noapic" solved this).
yenta related:
- pccard hardware is working now
- O2 Micro 4-1 cardreader is not working
Does someone have ideas, configs or patches for the cardreader? Do you need 
more info? Let me know.
