The NDIS drivers require the 8K stack, not ndiswrapper.

Because I use MDB, a kernel debugger I wrote that inserts beneath Linux 
via DRLX or inside of it, and I watched it crash in the Linux SCSI 
code.  There's code in Linux proper that also walks off the end of the 
stack.  No I did not report it.  But now I have.
