Thanks.  It's good to have BIOS experts involved too.  :)

I was more thinking that when CONFIG_PCI it should just always
descend into the relevant USB dirs; right now it only does it
when CONFIG_USB, and that shouldn't matter.
This is a reason to update that (a) patch before merging.

Yes.  That would be part of (b.1) patches above.  Ditto for UHCI, OHCI;
the resulting routine would be exported to HCDs given CONFIG_USB.
It's probably too early to talk about whether the driver model
should include platform-specific device reset() methods, though
that could be handy in some other board customization cases.  :)
