1) It was not my intent to produce FUD, and speculation is because I
   understood this was not a freely available standard (it can be
   found at 
http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/standards
 ).
2) I have now downloaded and read some of this standard.  You do
   realize that a uint16_t can take 32 bits, don't you?  (Hint: reread
   section 6.2.6.2 for the definition of width.)
3) There is still the issue that these types are not guaranteed to
   exist, as you have quoted.  Also the issue that what Linux
   guarantees for these types is not specified.
