EUhm now a bit more constructive than my last reply (sorry, couldn't help
myself :)
Referring to Mel Gorman's excellent v2.4 kernel VM documentation:
Understanding The
Linux Virtual Memory Manager
"
12. Swap Management
Just as Linux uses free memory for purposes such as buffering data from
disk, there eventually is a need to free up private or anonymous pages used
by a process. These pages, unlike those backed by a file on disk, cannot be
simply discarded to be read in later. Instead they have to be carefully
copied to backing storage, sometimes called the swap area. This chapter
details how Linux uses and manages its backing storage.
