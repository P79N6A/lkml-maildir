You were the one who asked for that patch.

Ack.

I care about Linux. I absolutely don't need a bridging firewall for anything. 
I just happen to know something about it.

This brings me to another question: I've been told it is the general concensus 
that this bridge firewall should be compiled in the kernel if 
CONFIG_NETFILTER=y. Or should it be a user option? It is predicted that using 
a user option will give alot of questions about the bridge firewall not 
working.

Will do.
