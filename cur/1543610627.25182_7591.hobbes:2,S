You do not understand the reasons behind the thread.
.journal files are only created when an ext2 FS is converted to ext3 *while*
it is mounted.  In this case tune2fs just creates a file (.journal) and
modifies a couple fields in the super block.
The newest e2fsck (1.25) will hide the file for you, just like it would be
if the conversion was done on an unmounted FS.
