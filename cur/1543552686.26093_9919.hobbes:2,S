IMHO, the modification of file-system code causes the weird
performance.
Most of processes are slept at:
	posix_lock_file()->locks_block_on()->interruptible_sleep_on_locks()
We revert two of test9 files (fs/fcntl.c fs/flock.c), to the previous
version, the performance problem disappeared and it becomes to the
same level as test8.
To narrow the problem, we measured performance of 3 configuration:
1) test9 with test8 fs/fcntl.c, test8 fs/flock.c
2) test9 with test8 fs/fcntl.c
3) test9 with test8 fs/flock.c
Only 3) shows the problem, so the main problem reside in fcntl.c (not
in flock.c).
So it seems:
the web-server, apache-1.3.9 in the redhat-6.1, issues lots of fcntl
to the file and those fcntls collide each other, and the processes
are blocked.
What has happend to fcntl.c?
