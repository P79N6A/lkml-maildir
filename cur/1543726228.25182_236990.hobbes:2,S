With L2, 1:3, max_sectors_kb=256, and the above change, the performance
is truly amazing.  Over 20 million interrupts, on a 600Mhz machine, the
worst latency I was able to trigger was 46 usecs.  There does not seem
to be any adverse affect on any aspect of the system.
This looks like the perfect setup for a DAW.
