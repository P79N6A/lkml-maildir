Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I'm pleased to say I've cleaned up the memory hotremoval patch
Mr. Iwamoto implemented. Part of ugly code has gone.
Main changes are:
  - Replaced the name remap with mmigrate as it was used for
    another fuctionality.
  - Made some of the memory hotremoval code share with the swapout-code.
  - Added many comments to describe the design of the memory hotremoval.
  - Added a basic funtion to support for memsection.
    try_to_migrate_page() is it. It continues to get a proper page
    in a specified section and migrate it while there remain pages
    in the section.
The patches are against linux-2.6.7.
Note that some patches are to fix bugs. Without the patches hugetlbpage
migration won't work.
Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
