| How do you solve priority inversion?
I don't solve it. It is relatively resistant to priority inversion by
tasks traversing all the priorities lower than itself rather than
sitting at one priority. It does this more strictly when interactive is
disabled which I recommend for server and multiuser setups.
| Can you do "true idle threads" now? (I.e. nice +infinity?)
Not safely, no. I have a batch(idle) implementation that is relatively
safe but can be abused (it's in my -ck patchset only). At some stage if
the codebase settles down enough I'll try and introduce semaphore
tracking for batch processes that will elevate them to normal scheduling
~ to prevent DoSing.
Cheers,
Con
