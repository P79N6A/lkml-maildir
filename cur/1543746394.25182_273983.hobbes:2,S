That was the main thing, yes. Of course I may make mistakes and end up 
posting patches that are less than perfect, but review and fix bugs is 
my intent, building with -W is merely a way for me to find relevant bits 
to review.
But enough of this, I understand your views on the issue and thank you for 
your examples, now I'll focus on the code and see if it results in a few 
patches :)
