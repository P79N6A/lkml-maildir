	You blew it...
	It didn't come from AOL (check the Received-By headers).  It
came by way of PSI, and I've already sent a complaint to abuse there.
AOL may want to take action for fraudulent use of one of their addresses,
though, and I did let them know, as well.  I also contacted commnections.com
and ccgnv.net who are, somehow, associated with the targetnow.com domain
(DNS support is coming from them).  Do a "whois targetnow.com" and then
a "whois ccgnv.net" to find the appropriate points of contact.
	Anyone in states which have made it criminal to fraudulently modify
addresses for spamming (Washington and California, I think) might want to
contact their law enforcement agencies to take legal action...
