For a moment there is thought adding:
escape 2b
to the ppp options file would fix it, but '2b' in not escapable :-(
So either disabling it or renaming it (as you said) to something escapable
is the only option.  I assume using software compression might hide the
bug, as three +++ will surely compress to something else. 
This has to be near the top of the list of recent hardware braindamge.  I
wonder who has Hayes patent now that it went chapter 11, and what
ludricous amount is being charged for licensing to warrant this.
