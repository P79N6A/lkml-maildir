The meaning of a cap would change every time you took a CPU off/on line. 
  This makes the behaviour less predictable not more predictable (at 
least in my opinion).  You also have the possibility of a cap being 
larger than the capacity of a single CPU which doesn't make sense when 
capping at the task level.
However, if you still preferred that interface, it could be implemented 
as a wrapper around these functionalities out in user space or inside a 
resource management component.

I look forward to your comments.
