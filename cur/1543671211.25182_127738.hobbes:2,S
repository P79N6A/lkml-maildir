Oops, this analysis is wrong..  The svwks_revision variable is set
in the init_chipset_svwks() function, which doesn't appear to ever
get called because dev->irq==0.  The init_chipset function is also
responsible for the call to ide_pci_register_host_proc(), so since
it isn't being called there is no /proc/ide/svwks.
I think for Serverworks IDE you will never get a valid dev->irq out
of the pci config register, so maybe should there still be a call to
d->init_chipset in this block from drivers/ide/setup-pci.c:
   } else if (!pciirq) {
       if (noisy)
           printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: bad irq (%d): will probe later\n",
                  d->name, pciirq);
       pciirq = 0;
   }
