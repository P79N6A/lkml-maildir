OK, then you have worse hardware than I had when I started to measure
latency :-)

I would say that the numbers are quite good :-)
For comparation check
  
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/
There are some load tests there that you can use
to generate load: disk access, memory pressure, X11, ...
Note that more memory can result in worse latency, longer linked lists
to walk...
