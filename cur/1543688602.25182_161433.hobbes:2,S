Sorry for a bit off topic.
I have a Dell 8200 laptop and a docking station, both with 3c905C 
ethenet chips. I wish to use the 3c905c internal to the docking 
station when the system is docked. Otherwise the 3c905c internal to 
the 8200. In my office I would like to run with both eth0 and eth1, 
but I need to be able to connect the correct interface to the correct 
cable. The same module is loaded for both devices.
The HOWTOs I found all assumed you had old cards with fixed addresses. 
These could be specified as options in modules.conf. From the Net-HOWTO:
         alias eth0 ne
         alias eth1 ne
         alias eth2 ne
         options ne io=0x220,0x240,0x300
But this does not seem to apply to the 3c59x driver. modinfo doesn't 
even list "io" as a valid option.
I did find:
  1) in /proc/ioports, one of the devices is listed with "(#2)" after it.
  2) in /etc/sysconfig/hwconf, one of the devices has
subDeviceId = 00d4, the other 00de.
I have tried changing the order of loading modules, along with a few 
vain attempts in modules.conf. For info, this is a Redhat system. 
Where is the definition as to which device will be associated with 
eth0 made?
Any assistance would be appreciated. I did try to RTFM, I just can't 
find the correct "fine manual";-)
thanks
don
