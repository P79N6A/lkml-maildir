Yes. By the way, there's nothing that really requires that you
use a /smack symlink if you don't want to. /tmp can still be a
real directory, a mount point, a symlink to /var/tmp, or whatever
else you want it to be if that suits your needs better. For the
simplest scenarios /tmp -> /smack/tmp -> /moldy/<label> has every
other scheme I've seen throughly beaten.

Who said anything about mounting under /moldy? I never did.

Is the objection that there is a default value coded in?
