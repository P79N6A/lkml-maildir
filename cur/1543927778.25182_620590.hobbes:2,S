You're not calling pci_enable_device anywhere. Unless you do this before 
requesting the IRQ, the IRQ routing may not be set up properly for your 
device and it may not even give you the right IRQ number. You should see 
a line like this somewhere in dmesg for the IRQ your card is on:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.2[D] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 17
I think this behavior changed in the somewhat recent past..
