Yes, I object. I want to understand why it would matter. If this is a 
compiler bug, it's a really rather bad one. And if it's just some stupid 
bug in our pmd_bad() macro, I still want to know what the problem was.
Can you compile both ways and look at what changed at the offending site 
(which is apparently "follow_page()")?
And do you have some odd compiler version?
