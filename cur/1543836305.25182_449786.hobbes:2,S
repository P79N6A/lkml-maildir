Many thanks for kind replies.
You said inode cache is never swapped at all. In other words, the
inode cache pages are not swappable. How do you know the pages are
never swapped out? How can I tell whether a specific memory page is
swappable?  Can you point me to the right place in the kernel so that
I can see more details?
If my understanding is right, inode cache shrinker only frees the
reclaimable inodes, which means, if a lot of files are opened when
shrinker is activated, the shrinker may not find sufficient
reclaimable inodes to free enough space. What will Linux do under such
condition?
