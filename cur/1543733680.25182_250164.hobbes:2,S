I have heard of someone using two 3D displays, but he
used separate cards.  Can you get this on a single G550, which
supports two monitors but don't duplicate all hardware?
I have tried running two 2D-drivers, that works. But running
even one 3D app then froze 2D on the other display until
the 3D action ended. Simultaneous 3D was impossible, the
second user got segfaults when 3D was "busy" on the first display.
