As far as I know the tabs/spaces are exactly the way I want them. 
There are tabs for the number of indentation levels. From then on
there are only spaces.
Although the "kernel-rules" say that tabs are 8 spaces, if you set
your tabsize to 4, my sources should still be nicely formatted.  If
I'd perform your substitute it wouldn't.
