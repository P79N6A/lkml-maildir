Why is all this sophistication needed for hashing pages to wait queues?
I understand that you should avoid a stupid hash (such as one where all
pages end up on the same wait queue), and I understand why a cache needs
a well-chosen hash, and I understand why shift is preferred to multiply;
but I don't get why so much discussion of the precise hash for choosing
the wait queue of a page: aren't the waits rare, and the pages mostly
well-distributed anyway?
