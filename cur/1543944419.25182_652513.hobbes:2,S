boots! For some reason, i had to apply it by hand (to 2.6.24.2), and i
was too stupid to examine how to produce a new patch. Looks like i have
to read the documentation at kernelnewbies.org...
Anyway, the patch fits perfectly and now UDMA/33 (due to 40wire-cable,
vendor says UDMA/100 should work either) on a HDD using pata_cs5536 just
works =)
