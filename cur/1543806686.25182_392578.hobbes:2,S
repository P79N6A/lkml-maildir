There is the convention that for the compat system calls all the args
will be 32-bit zero extended by the platform syscall entry code before
the C code is invoked.  This topic used to come up a lot and finally
we all decided that was the thing to do.
It's important (at least I think so :-) for all of this generic compat
code to be able to have a well defined argument environment.
Anyways, I think that's how Stephen arrived at his patch.
