Did I miss something?  Is it not the case that as soon as the
library returns a handle, rather than an fd, then the whole
advantage of timerfd() (being able to select/poll/epoll on 
the timer as well as other fds) is lost?

POSIX may goof in places, but in general it is the result of
many smart people thinking about how to design/standardize APIs.
So the onus is on us to explain why they got this point wrong.
And it is not merely POSIX that did things things in the
way I've described: so did the earlier setitimer()/getitimer().
Cheers,
Michael
