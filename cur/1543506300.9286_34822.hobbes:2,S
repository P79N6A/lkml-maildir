Riley, 
there are several ways of getting things sorted. Some are better 
than others. Let him do it his way. Don't force your preference on
others. 
Really, the qmail method has its advantages. For example, when the
mailing-list administrator starts messing with the list and sending
messages to ...-outgoing, some of the procmail-recognized-headers end
up missing. And the Email ends up in my regular mailbox. No such
problem if I'd subscribed wolff-kernel instead of my regular email
address.
