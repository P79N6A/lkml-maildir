It wasn't my cards, but was reported by several other folk.  I don't think
we can revert on this without breakage.
However, we should probably ensure that we don't end up setting voltage
bits which the cards don't support.  So maybe masking the resulting OCR
value with the received combined OCR would be a good idea?  Such as:
