The copy_*_user() inside kmap_atomic() is problematic.
On some configs (eg, x86, highmem) the process is running atomically, hence
the copy_*_user() will *refuse* to fault in the user's page if it's not
present.  Because pagefaulting involves doing things which sleep.
So
a) This code will generate might_sleep() warnings at runtime and
b) It'll return -EFAULT for user pages which haven't been faulted in yet.
We do all sorts of gruesome tricks in mm/filemap.c to get around all this. 
I don't think your code is as performance-sensitive, so a suitable fix
might be to double-copy the data.  Make sure that the same physical page is
used as a bounce page for each copy (ie: get the caller to pass it in) and
that page will be cache-hot and the performance should be acceptable.
If it really is performance-sensitive then you'll need to play filemap.c
games.  It'd be better to use a sleeping kmap instead, if poss.  That's
kmap().
Please send an incremental patch when it's sorted.
