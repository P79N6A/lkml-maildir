that's an xfs bug found by Andrew, it started to be visible in -aa
because of the objrmap hardness checks from Dave. You can safely ignore
it, the xfs folks are already testing a fix. I didn't delete the WARN_ON
because it's a race condition we want to trap, but you can go ahead and
delete by hand mm/filemap.c:104 and mm/objrmap.c:379 if you're annoyed
by these warning messages. Kernel will work as stable as mainline
despite of the warnings.
