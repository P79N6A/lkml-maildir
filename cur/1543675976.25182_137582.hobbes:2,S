Hi,
I'm finding it difficult to create more than, say 80, logical partitions 
on a server.  The symptoms are that lvcreate keeps segfaulting.  The 
reason is that /proc/partitions contains invalid data.
I initially wondered whether it might be the device naming convention 
since when we go above 26 logical paritions we start writing out lvm{, 
lvm}, lvm[ etc. so I added the following patch to write out the devices 
as digits but this didn't have any effect.

                 case MD_MAJOR:

                         sprintf(buf, "%s%d", maj, unit);
                         return buf;
         }
This is quite easy to replicate, just create many logical volumes until 
lvcreate fails e.g.
$ lvcreate -L 10M -n foo01 vol01
etc.
The attached file is simply the output of:
$ cat /proc/partitions >/root/foo.txt
Any thoughts ?
Regards,
Nick.
