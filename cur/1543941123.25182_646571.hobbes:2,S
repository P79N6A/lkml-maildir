I think so. There was one objection that it introduced a dependency on 
pnpacpi loading after PCI bus enumeration, though.
Linus also suggested that pnpacpi could be marking the resources as 
"present but unused" so that drivers can request those regions but we 
still prevent dynamically assigning resources into them.
