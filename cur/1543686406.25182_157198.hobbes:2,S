This patch is ok with me.
And I agree with David that, in generic, C99 initializers is the way to 
go.  However, the higher level point remains:
PCI IDs, and data like them, are fundamentally not C code.
I'm a strong believer in putting data in its most natural form, and then 
transforming it via automated tools into the desired form.  C code is a 
natural form of data that describes "process and procedure", and the 
compiler is the automated tool that transforms it.  PCI ID tables are 
data that is not process/procedure, but instead much more of a 
traditional data table.  So it should be a form more suitable for its 
multiple uses.  Distro installers and other utilities already pay 
attention to the PCI ID tables in drivers.  Why are we compiling 
non-code into ELF .o objects, and then forcing people to extract that 
non-code from .o files?  In the South we call it "going around your 
elbow to get to your thumb" :)
