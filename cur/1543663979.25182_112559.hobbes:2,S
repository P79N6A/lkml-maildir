This requires a complete analysis of the loop body, which means that the
warning must be moved down from the front end (the common type of the
operands only depends on the type of the operands, not of any current
value of the expressions).

But array[-1] is wrong.  An array can never have a negative index (I'm
*not* talking about pointers).
