This was noticed as a distro regression as they moved from the kernels
that used to invalidate the entire address space on direct io ops to
more modern ones that only invalidate the region being written.
You can end up with significant memory pressure after this change with a
large enough working set on disk.

Yeah, I failed to tell Jeff that it should be calling
filemap_fdatawrite() first to get things into writeback.  (And
presumably not truncating if that returns an error.)
