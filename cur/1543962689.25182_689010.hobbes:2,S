on nohz we still keep jiffies uptodate - despite there not being an 
explicit 'keep jiffies uptodate' tick interrupt anymore. So on every 
irq_enter() we roll jiffies forward - if needed - and thus emulate 
jiffies behavior to drivers and core kernel code, etc.
if an IPI on Power does not do an irq_enter() then you might miss out on 
updated jiffies. That might not matter for most jiffies, but you might 
also miss out on the 'touch the softlockup watchdog because we just woke 
from idle' action. This is what triggered the false positive warnings on 
Sparc64.
the same bug existed on x86 too: that too does a few IPIs without 
irq_enter/irq_exit. We now removed the softlockup dependency so it 
should not be required to do an irq_enter()/exit anymore - unless the 
code that the IPI uses accesses jiffies. (but that would be unusual)
