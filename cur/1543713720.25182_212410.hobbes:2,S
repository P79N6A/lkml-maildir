Christophs away for a few days, so I'll jump in.  The patch was not
quite right - the first part should be dropped, the second section
is right.  In the first hunk (i.e. the pagebuf_lookup_pages changes)
we are always working with page cache pages there, so the change was
unnecessary (it also tested a flag which only gets set several lines
down in that call, so wasn't quite right anyway).  The second part of
the patch is the critical piece, as it avoids updating the page->private
field in the IO completion handler for non-pagecache pages.  I've been
testing with just that piece, and it looks good.
I'll be putting this into our local XFS trees shortly, and will send
it on to Linus and Andrew soon.
thanks Andrea.
