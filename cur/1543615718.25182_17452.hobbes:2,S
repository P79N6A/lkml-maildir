	The kdev_t changes have exposed an amusing bug in
linux-2.5.2-pre8/drivers/isdn/sc/command.c.  A routine that
was intended to return the error "-ENODEV" was actually
returning "-NODEV" (prevously zero, now a compilation error).
Here is the fix.
	I have already checked to see that '-NODEV' and '- NODEV' do
not appear anywhere else in the kernel sources.
