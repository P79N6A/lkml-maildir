OK, I suppose that it's the final variant of FAT patch. It's stable, it
had grown large enough, so I'ld rather put UMSDOS cleanup in a separate
patch. This one will go to Linus for 2.2.8 if there will be no bug
reports, so please test it.
The only change since v16:
	Fix for Microsoft idiocy wrt so-called FAT32. Actually it's FAT28.
In other words, upper 4 bits of FAT entry are "reserved and undefined".
I.e. contain random garbage. Fix: in fat_access() &=0xfffffff before any
further tests.
	If you've seen random "attempt to access beyond end of device" on
FAT filesystems that were OK from the Windows POV - see if this patch will
fix the situation.
Patch lives on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/fat-patch-17.gz
     							Cheers,
     								Al
