I like it.  Especially the way you eliminated the situation where
we would have multiple tasks waiting for schedule.  Hope this is
not a frequent situation!!!  The only thing I don't like is the
use of has_cpu to prevent the task from being scheduled.  Right
now, I can't think of any problems with it.  However, in the past
I have been bit by using fields for purposes other than what they
were designed for.
