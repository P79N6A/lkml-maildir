Well, thats what I've been thinking thats screwing me. Because I've been using 
ALSA since my 2.4.x days (I switched over to 2.6 and 2.6.1), and I know my 
analog joystick works with ALSA and 2.6 (I just don't know when the bug 
appeared) and I've also upgraded my ALSA userland over the years. Infact, I'm 
almost convinced that the ALSA userland is causing the bug.
