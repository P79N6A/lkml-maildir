Yes, I see. I did not realize before that the lock_sock and the
sk->backlog framework are not two independent things. They really
seem to be designed for team work only.  Did I get this right?
And I realize that the lock_sock framework is superior to my approach.
It does not only serialize output, it also serialized output and input
such that other problems are solved as well (the current code, even
after serializing output, could still suffer from atomicity problems
when input path interrupts output path an modifies protocol control
block variables in a non-atomic manner). The lock_sock framework properly
applied seems to make socket propgramming as easy as in the old cli()/sti()
days again. Basically, it seems to be a Ždisable interrupts for this socketŽ

Well, the term Žprotocol globalŽ was misleading. I should have
said Žglobal to the protocol-familyŽ. E.g. there are currently some
cli()/sti() pairs to protect socket list and routing table manipulations.
tcp also seems to use some additional protocol-global spinlocks
(like tcp_portalloc_lock).

The reason why I was asking is that I recently got IP and PPP tunneling
over X.25 working (in-kernel). In that case, protocol output processing
would be done from NET_TX_SOFTIRQ context, which is only allowed to
to bh_lock_sock(), but not lock_sock(). As bh_lock_sock() is just
spin_lock() -- and not spin_lock_bh() -- this could stall the CPU
if NET_TX_SOFTIRQ were preempted by a timer or NET_RX_SOFTIRQ while holding
the spinlock. In that case, beeing preemptable would make a very essential
difference.

Thanks for the insight. I hope this is sufficient to migrate the code.
Not before 2.4.0-final, however :-).
Anyway, it seems that I can already make use the lock_sock() infrastructure
for fixing the output serialization, even without making the whole
protocol stack SMP-aware at once.
