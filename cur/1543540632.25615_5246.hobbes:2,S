I have tracked this linker problem to the an auto-generated program
called 'conmakehash' that appears to build unicode tables for the os
that get linked to the kernel image.  If I attempt to invoke this
program from an NWFS volume, it returns the linker error message above.
Anyone got any ideas?  I looked at the source code for the program and
it appears benign enough.
