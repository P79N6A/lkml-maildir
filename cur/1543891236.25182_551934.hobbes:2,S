Other than the fact that it is not a piece of candy to implement correctly.

Debian does, for one.  And I am pretty sure it is not the only one.
Also, let me state right now that IMO, this "I need X to be running and
logged in" for dock, eject, suspend, wlan on/off and other *system* level
activity to work is an extremely bad idea and broken on so many levels it is
not funny.
I have nothing against allowing such activities to be *modified* to suit the
logged in user, subject to approval by the system administrator.  But to
have them implemented in that level? Yuck.
But I don't see what this means for input device keyboard maps.  Any of the
proposed solutions to the problem so far will work equally well (or not well
:) ) for console and X users, even the "lots of KEY_UNKNOWN" one...
