That then doesn't include interrupt latency.  The nice thing about the
amlat tests is that the test predicts when the next interrupt should
occur, then measures the time between that prediction and the process
running in userspace.  If you just timestamp at wakeup, you miss all
the time between interrupt generation and noticing that the process is
to wake up.

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories,   all slightly different.
