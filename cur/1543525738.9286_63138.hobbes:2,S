    Because it's machine generated, and any fancy formatting or
    comments that you put in will be toasted as soon as you run
    any of the tools [1]
    I do that with all the config files that Mastodon's admintool
    understands -- people can still hand-edit their files, but any
    commentary will go *poof* as soon as admintool is run again.
