Well ... the other users are supposed to be going away.  They're
actually all coded wrongly in some way or other ... perhaps I should
speed up the process.

The block layer speaks in terms of requests and the scsi layers in terms
of commands.  The scsi_request_fn() actually associates a request with a
command.  However, since SCSI uses the block layer for queueing, all the
internal scsi command submit paths have to use requests.  This is what a
scsi_request is.  The reason for the special casing is that we can't use
the normal REQ_CMD or REQ_BLOCK_PC paths because they need ULD
initialisation and back end processing.
