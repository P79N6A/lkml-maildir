Of course you can hack the kernel to do it.
However, by replacing that box with Linux device you
get one more Linux box and you will be capable of
doing whole slew of useful things, like traffic filtering, shaping,
accounting, Ethernet bridging, etc etc etc, if/when you will need it.
You can easily debug problems with tools like tcpdump and ethereal.
I simply cannot list everything Linux can do, I don't plan to write
a novel here ;]
I bet current 'crazy box' has nothing even vaguely resembling
these capabilities. Heck, it cannot do standard TCP properly.
So there is little reason to waste your time trying to work around it.
