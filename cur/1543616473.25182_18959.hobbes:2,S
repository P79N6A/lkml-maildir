Subject: USB Sandisk SDDR-31 problems in 2.4.9 - 2.4.17

My system is currently an AMD Athlon with kernel 2.4.17, Adaptec 2940 PCI
SCSI card, Plextor 40X SCSI CD-ROM, Plextor 8x CD-R and the USB Sandisk
SDDR-31 compact flash reader.  With the 2.4.x series of the kernel, in
particular with RedHat's 2.4.9 kernel, 2.4.15, 2.4.16, and 2.4.17 I have
been experiencing the same two problems.
1. the SCSI CD-ROM on my system works fine, that is until I mount the USB
cf reader.  After doing so, any attempts to mount a CD in the CD-ROM gives
me the message "mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on
/dev/cdrom, or too many mounted file systems".  If the CD-ROM is already
mounted and I then mount the USB cf reader, the CD-ROM will no longer
respond...  unmounting and mounting the CD-ROM at this point seems to work
but any attempt to access the information is futile.  The physical eject
on the CD-ROM also ceases to function after this.  Tried removing all the
USB modules followed by the SCSI modules and then modprobe them all again
but doing that does not affect anything.  Only way to access my CD-ROM
again is a reboot of the machine.  The wierd thing to this is, it does not
affect my CD-R drive as it continues to work fine.  This happens again if
I were to repeat the above mentioned steps.
2. after mounting the USB cf reader, the shutting down of the system
stalls for quite a bit at the point where it tries to unmount all the file
systems.  This occurs regardless of whether I unmounted the drive or not.
Lastly, I know both the CD-ROM and USB cf reader are fine as they have
worked fine under the later 2.2.x kernels, as well as in Windows.
