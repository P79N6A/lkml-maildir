This is not a "change". Existing behaviour clearly cannot change. We're 
talking about new interfaces to export capabilities in the filesystem.
And pathnames are a _hell_ of a lot better and straightforward interface
than inode numbers are. It's confusing when you change the permission on
one path to notice that another path magically changed too.
