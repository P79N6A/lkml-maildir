Hi Andrew,
4 patches for s390. The first one contains the definition of
ptep_set_access_flags for s390. We need to flush the tlbs to
reflect changes in the _PAGE_RO bit. The generic function
flushes all tlbs, for s390 we can do better. We want to use
ipte to flush only the tlbs of a single page. Using good old
ptep_establish for ptep_set_access_flags is working just fine.
Short descriptions:
1) s390 core changes.
2) common i/o layer changes.
3) block device driver changes.
4) network driver fixes.
Patches apply against BitKeeper dated 02.06.2004.
blue skies,
  Martin.
