I share your surprise, it does seem rather odd.  I think what it's
really trying to do is distinguish how 2.6.9 starts the "Code:" bytes
at eip - 43, where 2.6.8 started at eip; but flag that since it's VLI
then it's got a bit of guessing to do.  I'd have preferred to work it
out from i386 and the new "<%02x>" around the eip byte itself, rather
than stick a "VLI" somewhere else; but let's not interfere now it's so.
