You know, I am glad you posted this, as my system bell stopped working
ages ago and I didn't know why (I am on x86 though).
So this post is in case anybody else has this peculiar problem.
I didn't have a CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR in my .config, so investigated...
It is cunningly hidden in Device Drivers->Input device
support->Miscellaneous devices->PC Speaker support
Then to get KDE to use it (I used KDE sound to *beep* before I sussed
this tonight), even more peculiar configuration is required:

All now works!  I did really miss the beeps for some silly reason...
