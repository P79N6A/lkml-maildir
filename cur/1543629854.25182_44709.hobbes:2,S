Well personally I would just love if there where a "go ahead and don't
care about "compatibility" for the following:
Make hdX gone and use the scsi device major/minor number stuff instead.
And then just making the ATA driver looking like if it where some
incapable SCSI would actually reduce tons of code from kudzu and
friends without the need for any adjustment there.
