Yuck.  Please.  No.  Doing it this way means you have to modify every
single serial driver out there which is a mamouth task.

Did you not look to see what's in this helper?  You'll find within here
the following code:
#ifdef CONFIG_HARD_PPS
        if ((port->flags & UPF_HARDPPS_CD) && status)
                hardpps();
#endif
which should've been a big sign lit up in bright lights in Times Square
pointing you towards the right place to put your code.

Why not continue to leave it as a decision of the administrator - if
you want ports to default to having PPS support enabled, change all
the registration to set UPF_HARDPPS_CD.  But leave the admin with
the ability to disable it.

This means that PPS support is not available for any port which wasn't
autoprobed at device discovery time.  That seems quite restrictive.
Maybe it needs to be coupled with the setting/clearing of UPF_HARDPPS_CD ?
