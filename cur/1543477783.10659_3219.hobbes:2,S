While initially liking the idea of /proc/config.gz, some thoughts.
A "nice" tool would read /proc/version, combine with clues from 
/proc/cmdline, parse /etc/lilo.conf or whatever, and then read the end of the
zImage.
However, this relies on a lot of things having not changed, to be able
to find the correct kernel.
Worst case, something like find, searching for the string from /proc/version
would find it.
To get more useable than this, you either need /proc/config.gz (which has
to be live in ram, all the time, otherwise it's of no more use than
the userspace solution, or some way of putting the filename in /proc/cmdline,
which I don't see a clean way of doing.
/proc/config.gz would be handy, if the kernel had been deleted, or is not
available, maybe the system was booted from a floppy, the kernel was re-built,
/etc/lilo.conf is not up to date, etc etc
