1. What do you mean by "allocating extra ptes during read-ahead"?  You mean
allocate pmds when read-ahead crosses a table boundary, e.g. every 1024
pages on x86?
2. I think, for non-swap ptes, that "fill in a pte, but only if the pte is
'not present' already" means exactly the same as "do not diddle entries
in existing ptes" so I must be missing your point.

I still don't see what you mean be pre-allocate ptes without faulting in
pages.  Are you proposing to store "not present" references to the
read-ahead physical pages so that future faults can avoid the hash
lookup?
so many questions :-)
