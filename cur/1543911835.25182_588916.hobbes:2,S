Judging from the regression lists and the regression reports we get 
post-release both on lkml and in the kernel Bugzilla we have much more 
than 100 unfixed regressions since 2.6.20 (plus regressions from older 
kernels...).
Tracking that many regressions is one problem (although getting all bug 
reports in Bugzilla would make this quite easy), but the bigger problem 
is how to get them debugged and resolved.
