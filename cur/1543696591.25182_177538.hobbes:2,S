2.6.0-test8 on a box with an AIC7899 performs exactly as expected. I'll
pull the mirror from the MPT and see what I get. 
The box with the aic7xxx is a 1P 1Ghz. I'll compile test9-bk11 on that
one just to be sure, but it looks like it may be a driver issue. I can
replicate this on another box with a 53C1030 running a mirror, so I
don't think it's specific hardware.
