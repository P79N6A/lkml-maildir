If you do this, you should probably also return -EAGAIN if the printer
is out of paper, otherwise I would still lose data when the printer
goes out of paper. Currently it returns -ENOSPC in this situation. I
suppose the different return codes were meant as a way for user space
to be able to know why printing failed, so that it could take
appropriate actions, but maybe this is not used by any programs.
