2.6.12-rc5-git9 on both x86 and x86_64. On the x86 I have as follows:-
177:     178576   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd:usb3, eth0
185:         64   IO-APIC-level  eth1
193:          5   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd:usb1, ohci1394
201:        961   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd:usb2, NVidia nForce2
The interrupts are increasing, but they come from eth0 only, usb3 and 
eth0 share the same interrupt.
On the x86_64, all joystick controls and buttons are functional
193:     107220   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd:usb1, uhci_hcd:usb2, 
uhci_hcd:usb3, uhci_hcd:usb4
201:      20940   IO-APIC-level  eth0
Possible problem with interrupt routing on the x86 box?. I shall try 
"pci=routeirq" next boot.
Regards
Sid.
