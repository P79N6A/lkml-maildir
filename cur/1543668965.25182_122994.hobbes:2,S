2.4.21pre -ac and I think now base trees have 24bit support in the
core code included and support for 24bit USB devices added. OSS 
doesn't really think happily in 24bit mode and the apps don't know
about it either. The ALSA layer in 2.5.x is a rather nicer replacement
without a lot of the limitations
