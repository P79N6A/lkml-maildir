Thanks, yes, that could well account for the residual difference: the
machines in question have 2 or 4 cpus, so the old slub_min_objects=4
has effectively become slub_min_objects=12 or slub_min_objects=16.
I'm now trying with slub_max_order=1 slub_min_objects=4 on the boot
lines (though I'll need to curtail tests on a couple of machines),
and will report back later.
It's great that SLUB provides these knobs; not so great that it needs them.
