Further to that, here's the patch I sent to Jeff Dike that changes the contents
of UML's page tables from virtual to physical addresses.  (UML 'physical'
addresses are are really user virtual addresses in a memory-mapped file, and its
kernel 'virtual' addresses are just constant offsets from that, as in native
Linux.)  It's interesting that only three lines had to be changed.  Nonetheless,
to find the correct three lines I had to make several hundred lines worth of
changes, to discover all the paths affected by the change from virtual to
physical.  The BUG added below is on a path that was certainly wrong in the
original but is never used, which is proven by booting UML with the BUG.
The new version is not less efficient than the original, perhaps slightly more
efficient if anything.  It is a whole lot more correct.
This together with the previously described header file cleanup put me in
position to test a UML prototype of a CONFIG_NONLINEAR option that maps
nonlinear physical memory to linear, contiguous kernel virtual addresses.
