Hello..
Linux kernel names the scsi drives sda, sdb .... so in case you switch
slots, or move across to a different controller
then its possible you can have very bad effects. Worst case is removing a
drive and the drive device files dont have a persistant assiciation with the
location, or do we have a magic superblock what the configured name was. 
is there a solution to Linux for this? i was looking at raid, but the config
file says /dev/sda etc, and it says it does do the superblock magic to avoid
this. In a SAN its more important as a remote scsi disk may be detectect in
a different order.
Please reply to me directly.
