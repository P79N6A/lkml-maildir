They certainly point out to the reader that one can expect a slab page 
here where one may not expect one since flush_dcache_page is a page
cache function.

VM_BUG_ON is different from BUG_ON. BUG_ON is always checked. VM_BUG_ON 
depends on a debug config option.

Others seemed to have encountered the same surprises before me. So it is 
better to point out these issues in the sources. There is the danger of 
other pagecache functions getting called for slab pages in the I/O 
layer and the check in page_mapping provides some protection from such 
changes. The checks/comments in the functions where we allow slab page use 
help the ones enhancing the code to keep these issues in mind and help 
them to not be surprised in turn.
