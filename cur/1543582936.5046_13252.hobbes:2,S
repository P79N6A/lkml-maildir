Hmm. This one goes in the "catastrophic" category.
For actual names:
N=557398, m=51 sz=2048, min 82, max 4002, av 272.17, stddev 45122.99
For generated names:
N=557398, m=51 sz=2048, min 0, max 44800, av 272.17, stddev 10208445.83
A very non-uniform distribution.

It has seven irreducible factors. Hardly "almost irreducible".
Shifting the 7-bit ASCII characters over 7 bits makes sure that there
is very little interaction to start with. And the final AND that truncates
to the final size of the hash chain kills the high order bits.
No good.
