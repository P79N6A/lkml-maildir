Since this is a monolithic kernel, that shouldn't be required.
I now have the box up on an ATA disk, root=/dev/hda1
but I don't see the sata drive or any scsi devices in
/proc/sys/dev/scsi/
This seems to indicate "sata_sil" which is more than lspci
# cat /proc/bus/pci/devices | grep sata
00a0    10953112        f       0000dc01        0000e001        0000e401        0000e801    0000ec01 e4400000        00000000        00000008        00000004        00000008        00000004     00000010        00000200        00080000        sata_sil
do I need to change my partition types to md or something? (...oh, atm I
can't.) Why isn't the controler in /proc/sys/dev/scsi/?
