As Dipankar pointed out, counters part of dynamically allocated structures; 
Like:
1. k_atm_dev_stats in atm_dev -- they are all atomic_t types right now.
   we must see a major benefit with statctrs here.  
   I don't have access to  atm infrastructure to test it though :(((
2. Atomic counters like dst->__refcnt; we might be able to hack
   route cache so that the periodic garbage collector can tolerate
   stale reads on the refcnt.  A dst_entry might get gc'd late, nevertheless
   it would boost performance on networking loads. (I still  have to 
   investigate  if we can do it at all...). 
This is what I have in mind for now.  Of course, if these primitives
are available to all, programmers will have more flexibility in 
designing datastructures.  We can then afford to have  non atomic_t
global counters for debugging etc., anywhere in the kernel; modules/dynamic
structures...
Thanks,
Kiran
