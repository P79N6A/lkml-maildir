Minimal (or no) core intervention on the DMA code path is a good thing.
I need to fix some broken hardware with software and must to move 96
bytes from one SPI device to another on the same SPI bus every for 4ms.
Needless memcpy's will cause substantial performance problems in my
application. Thinner is definitely better.
