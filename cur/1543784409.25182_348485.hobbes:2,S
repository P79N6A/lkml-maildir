Ah, but the seqlock's write side will cause cacheline bouncing in
the readside. Currently the lockless pagecache patches allow IO to
be busily populating one part of the cache while readers can look
up another part without any cacheline transfers.
Presumably you mean rcu_read_lock's preempt_disable(), however this
is a noop on non preempt kernels, and will almost certainly be hot
in cache in preempt kernels. What's more it should not cause bouncing.

Well the lockless radix tree read side patches (which I have actually
updated to fix some bugs and be rebased on top of your nice cleanup)
do provide that the radix trees are always traversable.
