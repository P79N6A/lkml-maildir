I think that my bind)mode patches which allow to control binding through
sysfs on pre-device and per-driver base should suffice here. I really doubt
that anybody would want to keep autoattach disabled and do all matching
manually ;). Besides having per-driver attribute allows drivers authors
control binding.

Do we really need 2 or even 3 files ("attach", "detach" and "rescan")?
Given that you really can't (at least not yet) do all there operations
for all buses from the core that woudl require 3 per-bus callbacks.
I think reserving special values such as "none" or "detach" and "rescan"
shoudl work just fine and also willallow extending supported operations
on per-bus basis. For example serio bus supports "reconnect" option which
tries to re-initialize device if something happened to it. It does not
want to do rescan as that would generate new input devices while it is
much more convenient to re-use old ones.

But when 2+ drivers can be bound to a device then particular _device_
gets to decide which driver is best suited for it, like in cases of
e100/eepro100 or psmouse/serio_raw.

Well, PCI does add a new ID to a driver allowing it to bind to a whole
new set of devices. I agree that this is a "driver" operation.

I disagree. Here you working with particular device. You are not saying
"from now on I want e100 to bind all my 5 new network cards that happen
to have id XXXX:YYYY". Instead you are saying "I want to bind e100 driver
to this card residing at /sys/bus/pci/0000.....". In other word it is
operation on particular device and should be done by manipulating device
attribute.
