FS's that require some ordering (journal) should be handling
this sort of stuff already. I have the same expectations as
Linas does WRT design. FS's that don't, will have the same sort
of problems that they would have as if the OS crashed.

See "Write Cache Enabled" (aka WCE or in HPUX speak "Immediate Reporting").
WCE must be disabled if data corruption can not be tolerated.
"Desktop" (ie unix workstations) systems typically have WCE enabled
so they look good on (stupid) performance benchmarks.
The only devices that lie about WCE have battery backed RAM buffers.
(e.g. SCSI RAID *devices* - multi-LUN, dual controller beasts)

It won't happen because of WCE. None of the major HW vendors will
sell or support HW with WCE enabled. Exactly for the reasons you
point out.
