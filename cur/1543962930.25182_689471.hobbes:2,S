I suspect that will just cause more problems, as the 'q' for an md
device never gets ->queue_lock initialised.
I suspect the correct thing to do is set
	q->queue_lock = &conf->device_lock;
at some stage, probably immediately after device_lock is initialised
in 'run'.
I was discussing this with Dan Williams starting
  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&m=120951839903995&w=4
though we don't have an agreed patch yet.
I'm wondering why you mention the issues of stacked devices though.  I
don't see how it applies.  Could you explain?
Thanks,
