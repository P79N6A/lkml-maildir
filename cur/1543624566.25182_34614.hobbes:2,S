Not sure right off the top of my head. I'm planning on using 2 controllers, 
each from a different manufactures. My reasoning behind this is two fold. 
Number one is in case a "bug" creeps up with one of the drivers I can still 
string all the drives off the other controller. Performance will decrease, 
but I'd rather be slow than dead in the water. The second reason is the 
probability of both controllers failing (hardware) at same time due to a bad 
chip batch at the manufacture.  Do you have any suggestions on controllers? 
Adaptec and IBM (not sure which models) ?
Thanks for your input!
