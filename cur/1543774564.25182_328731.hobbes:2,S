Thanks, but still no go, as I am using Gentoo and a totally bloated 
self-grown glibc initramfs environment. Whenever I boot 2.6.11.12, there 
is no problem whatsoever about modprobe returning before device nodes 
are created. Any ideas? I changed udev versions back and forth between 
058 and 056, did not make any difference either...
I can send any information of interest later tonight, but have to run 
for now. Thanks in advance!
