I'm using Ultra2 LVD drives, with an Adaptec AIC7xxx controller (AIC-7890), and
this is all with stock 2.2.12 and 2.2.12 with memory leak bug fixed.
I've also recently tried compiling the kernel with no IDE support (I only
have a CDROM and floppy on the machines as well), and reverting the
ll_rw_block.c in stock 2.2.12 back to the version from 2.2.5 (the last kernel
that definitely didn't show these errors), I don't actually know if this was a
sensible thing to do but I thought I'd give it a whirl!  Anyhow, neither of
these changes made any difference, I still got the same errors going to the
syslog.  However, without looking too hard I don't seem to have got the file
corruption that I saw before these changes (yet, the code is still running!).
