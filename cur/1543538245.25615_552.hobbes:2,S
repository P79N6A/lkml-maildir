Yes.

Problem with this is that `gcc -Wall' will generate a warning when it
checks the format string.
I proposed a little hack which avoided that a while back, but it got
loudly ignored at.
#define FMT_IP4	"\001%ld"
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "foo: src=" FMT_IP4 " dst= " FMT_IP4 "\n", src, dst);
and then teach vsprintf about control-A's in format strings.
And..
#define FMT_IP6 "\001%p"
	struct in6_addr *a;
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "foo: src=" FMT_IP6 "\n", a);
