I find that running these kernels (because of a netfilter modules
compile error, didn't try test13-pre1 or 2) in X my entire system
freezes, requiring a hard reboot.  With test12 final, suddenly
the screen streaked, then froze.
No oops, just the freeze.
Been a while (when I used to run Windoze) since I saw a frozen
screen complete with frozen mouse hour-glass. :)
FWIW. Bob L.
