I came to the conclusion that an rw-lock would make all writers
non-deterministic. I had a small discussion on this list with Ingo about
it. He had also come to the same conclusion.

No, I got stock there too.
But right now the following ideas spring to my mind:
If it is to solve the problem of having a callback wrap every use
in macroes and use the TYPE_EQUAL() to expclicit call the right function.
Only if the explicit type is unknown in the macro use the callback. That
should optimize stuff a little bit.. Just a wild idea.
If it is explicitly for PI you can do a thing like
 waiter->get_next_waiter();
to resolve the chain of waiters. Then you can have the PI algotithm work
iteratively without knowing the explicit kind of lock involved.
