Davide,
A further question: what is the expected behavior in the
following scenario:
1. Create a timerfd and arm it.
2. Wait until M timer expirations have occurred
3. Modify the settings of the timer
4. Wait for N further timer expirations have occurred
5. read() from the timerfd
Does the buffer returned by the read() contain the value
N or (M+N)?  In other words, should modifying the timer
settings reset the expiration count to zero?
Cheers,
Michael
