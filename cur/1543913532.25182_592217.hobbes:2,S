Will do next time.

It is more complex.
Currently a __grab_cache_page, a_ops->prepare_write,
filemap_copy_from_user[_iovec] and a_ops->commit_write is done
whenever we hit
  a) a page boundary
  b) a segment boundary
Those two cases don't have to, and from the stats basically never,
coincide. For NFSd this means we do this TWICE per segment and TWICE
per page.

What actually locks the page? Is it __grab_cache_page or
a_ops->prepare_write?
Note that the patch does not change the number of copy_from_user calls
being made nor does it change their arguments. If we need 2 (or more)
segments to fill a page we still do 2 seperate calls to
filemap_copy_from_user_iovec, both only spanning (part of) one
segment.
What the patch changes is the number of copy_from_user calls between
__grab_cache_page and a_ops->commit_write.
Copying a full PAGE_SIZE bytes from multiple segments in one go would
be a further improvement if that is possible.

Yes. We changed the order of copy_from_user calls and
a_ops->prepare_write by mistake. We will rectify that and do the
prepare_write for the full page (when possible) before copying the
data into the page.

Later than 2.6.23-rc5?
