So the buffer is big enought for your traffic, I suppose.
I saw something similar to your report, but indeed the buffer was too
small.
A good thing would be to see a packet dropped and the entries in
/proc/net/ip_conntrack, so that it will be possible to infer something.
with 2.4.10 i see packet tracing working very well also under
eavy network loads if the buffer is big enought...
and you are not using the controvers unclean module...
