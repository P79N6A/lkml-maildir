Yes, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
Filesystemcodes(extfs)
Ramdiskcodes
All compiled with kernel
So I can't find the problem:p

Have you enabled the rest of the initrd with CONFIG_INITRD (or something
like that?); is the filesystem code compiled into the kernel?  Is the
ramdisk code compiled into the kernel?
(I write this privately because these are too "trivial" problems for
linux-kernel, IMHO; but it would be nice if you wrote something about
how you did it in the end, what caused the errors..)
