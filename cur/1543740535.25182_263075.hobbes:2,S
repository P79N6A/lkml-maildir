Are you thinking something along the lines of an optimizing+profiling
host-CPU-software-renderer to FPGA-reprogrammed JIT accelerator? :)
The idea of reprogramming the hardware to toss out the line drawing and
other things that GTK and friends probably only present to X as pixmaps
anyway, and use that 'die space' for something else, is certainly appealing.
Of course, for a software -> hardware JITc, I think the budget required would
be a few magnitudes more than mentioned here earlier, and half a decade
of debugging or more ontop..
