I strongly disagree with this.  If you are reading documentation, you
should at least be intertained a bit, and if you take the "flavor" of

No, "exactly same C compiler" doesn't parse well in English.

Hm, but you understood the idea conveyed here, right?  That's the
important issue, we can argue about the exact structure of words all
