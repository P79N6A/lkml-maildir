I don't know. I only tried that kernel once and when it broke on me
went back to the previous 2.6.11 kernel it was running before.

Sure.
The machine is semi-production, so there are limits to how much and
when I can test on it.
roughly wednesday and thursday each week I should be able to run
experimental kernels on it, the rest of the week the box needs to be
stable.

What I'll do is apply that patch to the 2.6.18-rc3-git3 kernel that
BUG'ed on me, then wednesday next week I'll boot the machine with the
patched kernel and it should be able to run for ~24hrs, then I can
report back to you if it crashed or not.
Or is there some other way you'd rather have me do it (subject to the
constraint that I can only do experiments one and a half to two days a
week) ?
