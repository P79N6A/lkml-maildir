	The GPL is a grant of permission.  So, if you have an activity
that is restricted by copyright, you have to find something in the GPL
that gives you permission.  It's not just me saying that.  A representative
from the FSF explained that to room of ~50 lawyers and ~50 lay people
at a seminar that I went to on it.

	The FSF has addressed the question of interpretation of the
GPL with respect to how running a program in RAM may not by itself
make it a derivative work of other programs in RAM while dynamically
loading a module into a program (including a kernel) does in their
FAQ at
