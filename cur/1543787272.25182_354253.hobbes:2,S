(Sheesh, what is it with people thinking signals are something to be
used in any design after the 1970's?)
You're out of luck. Either register a sigio handler as a dispatcher in
your loader (shell) process before either of the two shared objects
do, and then somehow echo the signal to the correct object by hand
(assuming you can determine which HBA raised the signal -- and no idea
how'd you do this, actually), or fork() the main shell process into at
least one other one to allow receiving of the signals separately. I'd
suggest fork()ing twice, once per HBA, as that'd probably end up
simpler code-wise.
