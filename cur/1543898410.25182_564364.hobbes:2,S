More likely -EACCES, but otherwise not so terribly far off.

It's a deficiency of the file system semantics invented by
Kernighan, Thompson, et. al. in the later 1970's, favoring
speed and size of implementation over a pristine namespace.
The LSM is reasonably faithfull in presenting both the good
and the bad of the file system semantics.

While that is true of SELinux and AppArmor I would suggest that
is an artifact of the design goals of those two sophisticated
security schemes, not an attribute of the LSM.

Weeeelllll ... Module stacking has been a contentious issue from
day one of the LSM. Now that SELiunx is proposing to take over
capability processing for it's own purposes it's easy to think
that while other schemes may be up to stacking SELinux ain't gonna.

I don't think so. I see much greater social/political problems
than I see technical ones.

It's true that the code review for AppArmor has proven difficult.
That's going to be true of any change to the vfs layer, for any
reason. Have someone who was there tell you about the original XFS
proposals some time. Again, it's not LSM's fault.

That's pretty close to what you get with SELinux, and one reason
why that crowd has advocated that LSM be dumped in favor of SELinux
as the sole interface.

Sort of. While the SELinux kernel code isn't much, less than 20k lines,
the reference policy it requires is 200k lines, and the smallest policy
I've ever heard anyone claim runs is 600. Yes, you get interesting
functionality, but I don't recall there being many claims that policy
development is simple of late.

The LSM stacking problem, to my mind, is waiting on two modules that
really want to work together and enough thick skin to get past those
who don't want LSM to get better in hopes it will go away.
> I'm really not familiar with the security issues the LSM addresses
It addresses none, it is a tool put in place so that Linus doesn't
have to listen to security people argue over which scheme is better.

Please, examples.

The "additional" architecture of the LSM, as opposed to the originally
proposed "authoritative" model is responsible for a good deal of the
limited deficiency and uasability, but was considered necessary to
prevent kernel "highjacking". If it's fragile, it's mostly due to the
organic growth of security implementation in the kernel. It is under
utilized, and there are a number of reasons for that, but recent events
are encouraging.
