That seems very unlikely.  If you're booting a Xen-enabled kernel on
bare hardware, the Xen code should have no effect at all.  It certainly
shouldn't prevent you from probing devices.
Could you send me your .config and dmesg output?  Are you saying that
leaving PARAVIRT enabled but XEN disabled will allow your system to
boot?  What happens if you enable VMI and/or LGUEST?
Thanks,
