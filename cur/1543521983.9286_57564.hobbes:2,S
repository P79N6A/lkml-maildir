I'm writing a driver for a PCI device, which also has an External I/O
(XIO) Bus Interface. I need to reserve some memory from the PC 's address
space to be used by the XIO Interface.
How do i find out a 'memory hole' which could be used, & how do i
'reserve' this memory range, so that it doesn't get allocated/used by any
other device? 
Anand.
