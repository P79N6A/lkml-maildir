Ugh, very sorry about that, I was thinking of the USB and PCI new_id
stuff.  You are right.
Yes, bind happening after the __init data section is thrown away, if
CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not enabled would be a bad thing.  But unbind can
stay.  I'll go make up a patch for that.

I don't have a problem moving the code if it makes it easier.  Have a
patch?  :)
