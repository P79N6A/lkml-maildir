Thanks for review Kame, this patch should be just dropped.
Actually the only code snippet which make me nervious is
sizeof (mem_section) part. Which is to remain power of
two and even doesn't have 'packed' attribute neither any
comments above. And if it happens that it will be modified
or say gcc decide to add some bytes here (bugs happens) we
would silently address wrong mem_section. So I think at least
the 'comment' part of my patch is deserve to be applied :)
