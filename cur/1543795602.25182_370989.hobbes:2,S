I investigated the issue a bit  more. When the system under heavy load
(%100 cpu usage), hard lock up/complete freeze occures a few minutes later.
For example, compiling a software or issuing "updatedb" causes this.
At this point, system responds anything. I just hardly caught this
event while freezing:
~#>echo "t" > /proc/sysrq-trigger
[  849.651134 ]  SysRq : Show State
My syslog and lsmod output attached
