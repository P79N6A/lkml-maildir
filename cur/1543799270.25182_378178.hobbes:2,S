Accessing a mounted VFAT for this is probably not a good idea.
However, a userland solution should be possible and much easier than
trying this from the kernel.
Look at the mtools package:
	
http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/mtools.html
where you should find tools that do such access already.  Then, start
hacking the mdir(1) tool, or some such, to sort the VFAT orders
however you like them.
