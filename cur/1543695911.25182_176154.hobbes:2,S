There are no separate patches.  You can check the README.Debian file
for the details of the changes.

I submit them as they come in.  The bulk of the size comes from the
making IDE modules work which isn't right yet.
The rest of them which are suitable for general consumption have
been submitted previously.  I will resend them later.

Actually grow_dev_page will free the wrong-sized ones.
It seems that the only problem is that we don't check the size in
__find_get_block_slow().  So what about this patch?
The point of all this is to avoid unnecessary reads, and more importantly
preserve the contents of RAM disks when someone calls set_blocksize().
