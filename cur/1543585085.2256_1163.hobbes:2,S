Marcelo (et al),
I'll give it a whirl with the patch.  Should I also
try setting `nmi_watchdog=0' in lilo.conf, as Andrew
Morton suggests?
Additionally, I'll upgrade my version of ksymoops.
Unfortunately, I won't get a chance to test all of
this until Monday; at which time I'll report back to
the group.
v/r
Shane
