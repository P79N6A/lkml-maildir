Have you looked at 8250_early.c already in the kernel?
        console=        [KNL] Output console device and options.
                uart,io,<addr>[,options]
                uart,mmio,<addr>[,options]
                        Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
                        UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address,
                        switching to the matching ttyS device later.  The
                        options are the same as for ttyS, above.
