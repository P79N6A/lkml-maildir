AS> When I user the ieee1394 subsystem to transmit data from a camcorder to an 
AS> IDE disk and the IDE driver is not using DMA, then there will be some data 
AS> lost in the ieee1394 driver. If I turn on DMA in the IDE driver (hdparm -d1 
AS> /dev/hda), I do not have any data loss in the ieee1394 driver. Also, on a 
IDE is blocking interrupts for too long in non-DMA mode? Try hdparm -u 1
in non-dma mode - this may help if interrupt latency is the issue.
