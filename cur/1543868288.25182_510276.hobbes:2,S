How about extendign the current 'option' syntax to do this?
So we could do something like:
choice
	prompt "choice prompt"
	default VAL_FIRST
	option multivalue if !CONFIG_ONLY_HAVE_ONE
config VAL_FIRST
	bool "first"
config VAL_SECOND
	bool "second"
endchoice
It seems to fit well with how option is used today, and extends current
syntax nicely.
