Hello,
I get repeatable errors with 2.4.6 patched with the international encryption 
patch patch-int-2.4.3.1.bz2 when building loop device filesystems on top of 
Reiserfs.
All I have to do is:
1. dd if=/dev/zero of=testfs bs=1024 count=100000
2. losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 ./testfs
3. mke2fs /dev/loop0
4. mount /dev/loop0 ./test
5. cd test ; touch m ; cd ..
6. umount ./test
7. losetup -d /dev/loop0
8. losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 ./testfs
9. e2fsck /dev/loop0  *** All heck breaks loose.
The thing is, I can still mount previously created AES loopback filesystems 
but I can't e2fsck them. Well, if I do I get the following:
e2fsck 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Group descriptors look bad... trying backup blocks...
Inode count in superblock is 27112, should be 25064.
Fix? yes
Block bitmap for group 0 is not in group.  (block 1569951131)
Relocate? yes
Inode bitmap for group 0 is not in group.  (block 1258458187)
Relocate? yes
Inode table for group 0 is not in group.  (block 865539952)
WARNING: SEVERE DATA LOSS POSSIBLE.
Relocate?
