Daniel Stone, the administrator of freedesk.org, has just taken it
upon himself to censor my article on the state of the X server. His
lame excuse is that I have stopped working the core of Xegl. It
doesn't seem to matter that I contributed 1,000s of lines of code to
fd.o that I am continuing to do maintenance on. So much for this being
a free desktop.
Can some else provide a place for me to host the article?
