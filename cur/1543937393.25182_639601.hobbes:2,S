Subject: [PATCH] x86: clean arch/[i386|x86_64] in make mrproper
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/17/131

Applies to: 2.6.24-rc8-git1
For backward compatibility with earlier (< 2.6.24) kernels,
arch/i386/boot/bzImage or arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage
symbolic links to arch/x86/boot/bzImage
are created when you build an x86 kernel.
The arch/i386 or arch/x86_64 directories are then
created for this only purpose.
Issue: these generated directories and symbolic
links are *not cleaned up* when you run
"make mrproper" (and thus "make distclean").
This disturbs the production of patches,
because the source tree is left with generated files
and directories.
Proposed fix: add arch/i386 and arch/x86_84 to
the list of directories cleaned by "make mrproper"
Cleaner solution: stop creating these symbolic
links, but this could cause issues with scripts
still expecting bzImage in arch/i386/boot/bzImage
or in arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage.
What do you think? I can submit another patch for
the second option.
Michael.
