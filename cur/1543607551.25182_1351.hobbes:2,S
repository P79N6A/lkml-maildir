List,
I am having a problem with a 3c905C and later kernels (2.4.9, 2.4.12 and
2.4.13).  When I try to use my 3c905C with these kernels I get this error
message:
Cannot open netlink socket: Address family not supported by protocol
Kernel 2.4.7 works fine with this nic tho. I also tried this on another
machine with the same results.
Any suggestions?
thank you,
