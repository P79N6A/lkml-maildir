Because the CPU only offers these two states.

However, the CPU only supports 500 MHz or 600 MHz. Possibly, the other
effect you're seeing is from CPU frequency throttling which is (mostly)
useless.

The ACPI driver most likely would export the same two states. If it doesn't
work, it is (most likely) a BIOS issue [i.e. the BIOS only is ACPI
1.0-compliant and not 2.0] and not an ACPI issue.
