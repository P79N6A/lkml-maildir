Ok test done.
With kernel 1. the behavior is the same as with your plain second
patch only (flush input works but I cannot read anymore from the
serial that was flushed without closing and reopening the port). See
previous mail for the details of the test.
With kernel 2 the behavior is the same as mainline (multiple flushes
are needed to completely empty the buffers). And I _can_ read further
chars from the serial line after the flush. Here it is the ipython
session that document the test with kernel 2:
	In [1]: import serial
	In [2]: s0 = serial.Serial(0, timeout=1)
	In [3]: s1 = serial.Serial(1, timeout=1)
	In [4]: s0.write('test\n')
	In [5]: s1.inWaiting()
	Out[5]: 5L
	In [6]: s1.readline()
	Out[6]: 'test\n'
	In [7]: for i in xrange(1000):
	   ...:     s0.write(str(i).zfill(8)+'\n')
	   ...:
	In [8]: s1.inWaiting()
	Out[8]: 4095L
	In [9]: s1.flushInput()
	In [10]: s1.inWaiting()
	Out[10]: 4095L                               # NOTE the buffer is still full!
	In [11]: s1.flushInput()
	In [12]: s1.inWaiting()
	Out[12]: 810L                                # The buffer beginning
to be drained
	In [13]: s1.flushInput()
	In [14]: s1.inWaiting()
	Out[14]: 0L                                   # Now the buffer is empty
	In [15]: s0.write('test\n')                  # An reading further chars works
	In [16]: s1.inWaiting()
	Out[16]: 5L
	In [17]: s1.readline()
	Out[17]: 'test\n'
