Besides - if you aren't root you can't do it. If you ARE root and are
going to do it, then you gain the additional priveleges first. The test
just becomes irrelevent. (usually the sequence is: gain "security
administrator", add "system administrator", and (sometimes) add "bypass
permissions" before doing the function. (Of course the terms are different
for each system).
Doesn't really matter - there are systems without a special purpose root
now - UNICOS can be configured that way, and I believe trusted Solaris,
trusted IRIX (if you can get it..) and HP has a version. Root is just the
account that owns the system files, but doesn't necessarily have the
ability/capability to change them.
