Subject: make xconfig too big to fit on 1024x768 display

I don't know if anyone else uses 1024x768 mode without panning, but the
2.2.0pre kernels' "make xconfig" window is too tall to fit on such a screen
-- running it on such a display, there are lots of subsections I can't see
and can get to only via the "next" buttons. I can't see any subsections past
"Network File Systems".
Wouldn't it be nice if the program used a scrollable list of subsections,
similarly to how it uses a scrollable list of options within subsections?
(Also, the help window for CONFIG_APM has a similar problem, the help text
is soo long I can't see it all on my screen, nor can I see the OK button.)
