For device discovery and initialization, the generic PCI code has to muck
with PCI specific resources (IO Port, MMIO, and IRQ related stuff primarily).

uhmm...If we are going to touch dma_mask in pci_dev, then just move it
to struct device and be done with it. Then fixup pci_set_dma_mask()
to do the right thing.

Duck! (that's going to get fixed it seems) ;^)
