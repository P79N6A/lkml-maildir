I'm running tar (the regular version not star) right now on an Athlon @
850. The fs is ext3 and the disk is a scsi drive.
So far, tar has been running for 17 min 25 sec, and that's what top says:
CPU states:  1.7% user, 98.2% system,  0.0% nice,  0.0% idle
(FYI, nothing else is taking some large amount of cpu time)
So I would say Joerg is right... :-(
