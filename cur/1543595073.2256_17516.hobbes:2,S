Then how does 1.44 megabytes of data from a floppy disk (that won't
fit below 1 megabyte), that is accessed in real-mode, ever get to
above 1 megabyte where it can be decompressed?
I think LILO copies each buffer read from a below 1 Megabyte buffer
(which is the only place the floppy can put its data via the BIOS),
to above 1 megabyte using the BIOS block-move function.
