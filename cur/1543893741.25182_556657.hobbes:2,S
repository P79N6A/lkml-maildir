Neat! It's great to see somebody else waking up to the idea that
storage media is NOT to be trusted.
Judging by the design paper, it looks like your structs have some
alignment problems.
The usual wishlist:
* inode-to-pathnames mapping
* a subvolume that is a single file (disk image, database, etc.)
* directory indexes to better support Wine and Samba
* secure delete via destruction of per-file or per-block random crypto keys
* fast (seekless) access to normal-sized SE Linux data
* atomic creation of copy-on-write directory trees
* immutable bits like UFS has
* hole punch ability
* insert/delete ability (add/remove a chunk in the middle of a file)
