Generally x86 is the most up-to-date, followed by PPC, Alpha, Sparc, and
ARM.
Other architectures receive less frequent updates, and you should use
that port's latest supported kernel, rather than the one downloaded from
the Linux kernel archives.
Though if someone wanted to send me an Indy...... :)
