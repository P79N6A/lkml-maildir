Unless you made some kind of agreement with the copyright holder or did
not lawfully acquire the software, you have every right to study it and
learn from it. You have every right to use your own knowledge to implement
a driver any way you want.
What you can't do, of course, is steal protected expression from the
driver. Function is not protected. Facts are not protected.
