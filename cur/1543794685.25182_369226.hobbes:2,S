As I said before, you should not rely on getpid() to work.  Any other
process in the system can bind to your pid which makes it unavailable
to your process.  In which case the kernel will pick an arbitrary
negative pid as your address.
You should always use getsockaddr(2) to get your local address.
Cheers,
