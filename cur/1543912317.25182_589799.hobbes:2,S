Hi, Nick,
As I said, I wasn't sure what to name the constants for the path and
height arrays, so I just commented the +1 there.  I've been running
this on one of my 64bit test systems successfully for about a day,
now.  The one code path I was concerned about was
radix_tree_node_alloc, since the prealloc array changes size with this
patch.  I stepped through the code by hand and it looks right to me.
Additionally, I wrote a kprobe that would simulate the
kmem_cache_alloc failure.  I then inserted a node at max height into
an empty tree with preemption disabled.  I verified, using the crash
utility, that the tree was constructed and filled in properly.
You can find the kprobe at
