Two totally separate issues should be two totally separate patches.
For the first:
* just add the missing zeroes.  No need to revert PCI_DEVICE() usage.
For the second:
* the sata_via PCI ID has been queued for 2.6.19 for quite a while.  I 
don't see a hugely pressing need for it to be in 2.6.18, but it's not a 
big deal to me.
