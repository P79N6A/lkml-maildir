Umm. We already do, since we effectively ignore what the actual hardware 
says, and replace it with our own version.

This in fact is likely the best part of it.
Because that at least guarantees that we never say we have a good PAT when 
the hardware doesn't even report it.
As it is, we seem to just blindly override hardware. It may be correct for 
all the models we override, but still..
