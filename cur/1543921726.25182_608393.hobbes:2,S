I still do not know for sure, but I have found some code that
puzzles me.
At fork() time, task->pid is set to task->pid->numbers[0].nr
On the other hand, fork() returns to the parent process:
task->pid[PIDTYPE_PID]->numbers[task->pid->level].nr
I have not unravelled the code enough yet to be sure whether
this is always the same number, but having a wrong PID number
somewhere could certainly explain these autofs4 errors:
Oct 22 14:39:01 kenny automount[2299]: cache_readlock: mapent cache
rwlock lock failed
Oct 22 14:39:01 kenny automount[2299]: unexpected pthreads error: 11 at
65 in cache.c
After all, autofs4 puts various kinds of PID information of the
daemon into the autofs4 waitqueue:
fs/autofs4/waitq.c:296:
                wq->uid = current->uid;
                wq->gid = current->gid;
                wq->pid = current->pid;
                wq->tgid = current->tgid;
Could this be related?
Wrt. the UML failures that Miklos is seeing, I imagine UML needs
to do some similar tricks.
