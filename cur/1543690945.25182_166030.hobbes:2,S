Hi Russell,
That was the problem, stupidly I had it compiled as module and somehow
it wasn't getting loaded. Once I compiled it into the kernel it seems to
work now so far. 
Also the problem in test4 where the wireless card was being detected as
a memory card seems to have fixed now :) 
Thanks a lot
-Phil
