The only problem I have is that the keyboard used to die from time
to time with 2.3.47.  Could be fixed by unplugging and reconnecting
it.  Did not happen yet since I've upgraded to 2.3.51.  Both
keyboard (original apple) and mouse (logitech) are connected to the
root-ports, the keyboards hub is'nt used.
