Fully secure == powered off, disconnected from the net, embedded into
concrete block and put into the collapsed mine. There is no such thing as
full security.

	Great. Except that you broke sudo, gave special attributes to half
of fileutils, broke perl scripts running from crontab (unless you bestow
full-caps on perl, or, better yet, keep a copy for each possible
combination of caps). With all due respect, is this proposal backed by
a single *working* system or is it a committee-designed OSIesque? In other
words, is it a codification of existing practice (on some research system,
whatever)? It may be a low blow, but... do you remember the late OSI/ISO?
If you can show the existing implementation - my thanks and apologies.
Otherwise... I dearly hope that it will not make its way into the official
tree. For a year or two.
