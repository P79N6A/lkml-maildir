When using netlabelctl on a dell laptop
I'm able to define the addresses that I want:
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:wlan0 address:<radiostation> 
label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add interface:wlan0 address:<myaddress> 
label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl  -p unlbl accept off
{the above was from 
http://paulmoore.livejournal.com/1758.html
 };
(I'm able to listen to the radio station allowed, then if I choose 
another station; if I haven't defined an address like the above, mplayer 
just sits there.denying the unlabeled packet. that is until I allow the 
address);
The problem I have is when I do the same on my macbook pro ati chipset.
with the ath9k module, I'm able to listen to any station, search the web 
etc..
it seems netlabelctl  -p unlbl accept off makes no difference if it's on 
or off.
 
Is this built into ath9k yet, or is there something I'm missing?
