The problem is called Andre Hedrick, a guy who is talking in miracles,
but seems to be unable to fix either the issues with:
 - the single TX4 with multiple PDC20270
nor:
 - multiple TX2 with PDC20268
or at least ignores further communication on that problems, if you
don't use some magic storage peoples language.(*) TM in a parallel 
universe, not too far from here...
Most other kernel guys prefer SCSI or simple IDE solutions.

Nope. In one board, I got two TX2 running fine. In different other
boards (tyan thunder dual athlon), only a single TX2 is working fine.
(System crashed shortly after IDE driver init in above mentioned 
combinations.
BTW: This is a 2 way communication problem: 
 - Andre ignores bugging user requests to some extend
 - He gets ignored by leading kernel hackers to some extend
both based on (*) 
One can only hope, that Andre gets his bablefish running, and
using it then to communicate with the rest of _this_ universe.
