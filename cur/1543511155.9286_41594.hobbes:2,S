I do not know if it is related, but a couple of weeks ago, I had a
similar problem. 
On running "cp -ax / archive", to create a backup for burning to CD, the
system exhibited similar symptoms. CPU usage went to 100%, load was over
3 and X became very sluggish, with the mouse pointer updating taking
several seconds. Running top showed that kflushd was using 35-40% CPU.
I repeated this several times with the same result. This was with kernel
2.2.10 + raid patch.
Currently, I cannot reproduce the problem. I now run 2.2.12 + latest
raid patch and the latest snapshot of the egcs compiler, ( an earlier
version used to compile 2.2.10).
The system is a PII300, 64Mb, 2x Quantum EIDE drives in raid 0.
