Hi,

Adding BIO_RW_SYNC doesn't make generic_make_request() synchronous as
in "generic_make_request() returns only after write completion".
BIO_RW_SYNC only asks the I/O layer to unplug immediatly. But
generic_make_request() still returns before the completion of the I/O,
and the completion is notified asynchronously.

Sincerly,
