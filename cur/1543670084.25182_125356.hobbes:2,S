Hi,
I made blank UDF image with mkudffs 1.0.0b2 (Debian) on ext3fs,and 
I mount this image to write files to udf image as below:
# mount -t udf -o loop image.img dvd/
And,when I trying to write latrge (>>100MB) files from ext3fs to this partition,
sometimes freeze kernel.
I don't know what's wrong,but before 2.4.21-pre6, this issue was *not* happened.
Regards,
 Ohta.
