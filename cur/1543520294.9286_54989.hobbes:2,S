Hello people,
Recently I needed some way of attacking the classical problem of walking a
spinlock-protected linked list while copying some node data to userspace.
A minute ago I noticed email from Scott Henry <scotth@sgi.com> asking
about map_user_kiobuf() and looking in the relevant source code I found
make_pages_present() which seems to be exactly what I wanted.
Can someone confirm that it is valid to do something like this:
if (make_pages_present(uaddr, uaddr + count))
   return -EFAULT;
lock a spinlock
while (walking linked list) {
  examine the data and, if needed __copy_to_user(uaddr, kaddr, size)
}
unlock a spinlock
But if that works why isn't it done in the places that need it?
Thanks in advance,
