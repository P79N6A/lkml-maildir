Well then in this case why not block out /proc/PID/maps then?  In general
the first entry of this file _IS_ /proc/PID/exe!!
Also, in such systems there exist modification to the proc fs so that
processes can't see any other users, and so that proc fs is VERY empty
and provides minimal information.
This still isn't a good reason for not allowing people to see
/prod/PID/exe.. anyone else have an idea as to why this policy exists in
the kernel?
