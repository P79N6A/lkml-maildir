I also noticed that struct task_struct -> state uses a volatile long ,
but it seems to only use a few bits . exit_state also uses a long type
and only uses a few bits .. They could be combined into one long (or
even and int) .. I noticed the comment below,
 * We have two separate sets of flags: task->state
 * is about runnability, while task->exit_state are
 * about the task exiting. Confusing, but this way
 * modifying one set can't modify the other one by

I think if it was all inside macro's it wouldn't be so easy to
accidentally set the exit_state when touching just state ..
