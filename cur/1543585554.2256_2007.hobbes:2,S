i also have a patched linux-2.4.2-ac20 tree for my own use at
ftp://acid.ch.pw.edu.pl/pub/sq5bpf/linux-2.4.2-ac20
+dpt.tar.gz  that
supports dpt smartraid V (i found a patch for 2.4.0-pre6 and hand patched
it in). it seems to work with my ISP2150 (didn't crash yet :), after
compiling with egcs 1.1.2 (some people warned about using anything else
than gcc 2.7.2.3).
the only caveat is that if you set the ramsize 49152, root flags to 0 etc
so it loads a floppy after a prompt, the dpt controller (and eepro100
that was also compiled in) gets initialised _after_ the root floppy is
loaded. i'm not sure if this is a bug with the dpt patch or with the
original kernel (will  check tomorrow).
