Valdis, you don't have to enable CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP in your system kernel.
The moment you enable it, by default it thinks that I am the capture kernel
and sets the value of CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START to 16MB (0x1000000) instead
of 1MB (0x100000).
Your procedure seems to be right. Please also paste output of /proc/iomem
in first kernel.
You can find more info on following link.
http://lse.sourceforge.net/kdump/
I am also copying the mail to fastboot mailing list where generally
kexec/kdump discussions take place
Thanks
Vivek
