I have (or to be fair, my work has) an old HP7200 parallel port CD-R
and CD-RW drive, and it runs perfectly under 2.4.0-test7... Haven't had
a single burn that has failed. It's max speed is 2x, but i always use
the
speed=2... Dunno why.. Just does... I'll try without, but I can't see
what it should change...
