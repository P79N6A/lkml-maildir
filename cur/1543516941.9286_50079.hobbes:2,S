well, this is probably mostly semantics anyway - because the boot loading
process (which loads the kernel image into RAM) doesnt analyze the BIOS
bootmap either (on x86, i dont know about Alpha). We basically can assume
that if a kernel image fits into some piece of memory, then the bootmap
fits there as well. The bootmap on a box with 1GB RAM is 32k on x86, and
16k on the Alpha, so we are not talking big memory here.
the real problem was never the bootmap but mem_map[]: much bigger, and
potentially problematic. This is mainly why bootmem.c got written.
