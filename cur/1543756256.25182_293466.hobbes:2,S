Note there is no detection. It just writes to a particular IO port
(2E by default).

You need to ask them what watchdog they use exactly.
I've seen motherboards that have w83637hf chips but
actually wire the intel watchdog up so you need the i8xx_tco driver
If they are using the w83726hf chip you need to ask
what IO port they're using.
