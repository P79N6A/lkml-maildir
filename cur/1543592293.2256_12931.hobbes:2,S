It will depends upon lot of thing :-
1.What is your size of ramfs ,
2. Are you using any harddisk ,
3. How many many files are you creating ,
4. How frequently you are making files .
5. What are the size of your files ?
In my case , my ramfs is of 14 MB , using no hard-disk , i am continously
making and deleting files of 4 K size , my Machine hangs within 5 minutes ,
by saying no memory left.
Please tell me about your system and what you are doing on it ?
Thanks ,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
