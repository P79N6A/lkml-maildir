Subject: IP changes in 2.3.4x make things wierd?

At some moment between 2.3.40 and 2.3.45 something changed in the
IP logic apparently.  My system is Glibc2 based, it is non-networked
most of the time, so I do not run network-related daemons like
portmapper.  When I first booted 2.3.45, I noticed that all operations
that require resolver slowed to a crawl.  I did investigation and
found that glibc resolver, among other things, is trying to query
the portmapper at localhost.  On 2.3.40, it immediately gets 
ECONNREFUSED but on 2.3.45 it succeeds and waits for answer for
5 seconds, and then makes several more attempts.  This is how it looks:
=========2.3.40:
bind(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(772), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
ioctl(3, FIONBIO, [1])                  = 0
sendto(3, "Z\224\37\311\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\2\0\1\206\240\0\0\0\2\0\0\0"..., 56, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(111), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 56
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLERR}], 1, 5000) = 1
recvfrom(3, 0x805d938, 400, 0, 0xbffff5bc, 0xbffff568) = -1 ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)
close(3)
==========2.3.45:
bind(3, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(767), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
ioctl(3, FIONBIO, [1])                  = 0
sendto(3, "x\266\301\6\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\2\0\1\206\240\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\3"..., 56, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(111), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 56
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN}], 1, 5000)  = 0
ioctl(3, SIOCGIFCONF, 0xbfffd274)       = 0
ioctl(3, SIOCGIFFLAGS, 0xbfffd27c)      = 0
sendto(3, "x\266\301\6\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\2\0\1\206\240\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\3"..., 56, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(111), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 56
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN}], 1, 5000)  = 0
ioctl(3, SIOCGIFCONF, 0xbfffd274)       = 0
ioctl(3, SIOCGIFFLAGS, 0xbfffd27c)      = 0
sendto(3, "x\266\301\6\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\2\0\1\206\240\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\3"..., 56, 0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(111), sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 56
poll( <unfinished ...>
My questions are: is this change of semantics intended, what's the
reason behind it and what is the "proper" workaround?
Thanks.
Eugene
