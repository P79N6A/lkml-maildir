Well ... or we had different meanings ;-) yes, lots of stuff is in 2.5
but I was meaning 2.4. If there's stuff that's in both RH and UL kernels,
and it's stable enough for them both to ship as their product, it sounds
mergeable to me.

I don't see what's wrong with putting 2.5 backports into 2.4 once they're
stable. And I'd rather have an ugly-hack-for-stability than an unstable
kernel ... 2.5 is the place for cleanliness ... 2.4 is a dead end that
just needs to work.

Right ... I think we're agreeing about what's the difference. Just
disagreeing about what should be in mainline 2.4. If most others think it
shouldn't go either, than I guess we need a separate tree for a 2.4 that
works, not a 2.4 that's pretty ...
