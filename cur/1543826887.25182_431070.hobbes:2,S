yeah - it's in fact a mutex already.

did my second trace make more sense? The dependency that the validator 
recorded can be pretty much taken as granted - it only stores 
dependencies that truly trigger runtime. What shouldnt be taken as 
granted is my explanation of the events :-)
there is a wide array of methods and APIs available to express locking 
semantics to the validator in a natural and non-intrusive way [for cases 
where the validator gets it wrong or simply has no way of auto-learning 
them] - but for that i'll first have to understand the locking semantics
:-)
