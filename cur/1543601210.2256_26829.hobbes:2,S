Hi Vinolin.
> Can you please reply me "which is the stable version of linux" now?
That depends what you mean by "stable", as there are currently two
parallel stable development trees:
 1. "Stable and ready for production use" is the latest 2.2 series
    kernel, found at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/
 on
    the Internet.
 2. "Stable but untested in production use" is the latest 2.4 series
    kernel, found at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/
 on
    the Internet.
Basically, the 2.4 series kernels are stable and contain all the latest
kernel technology, but you are advised to test your setup on a system
whose stability doesn't matter and satisfy yourself that they are
suitable for your use.
Best wishes from Riley.
