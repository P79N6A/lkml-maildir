I doubt that bounce buffers are necessary for 4 GB:
* most fast disk controllers use DMA
* noone would combine a 4 GB memory computer with an old IDE disk.
But perhaps you should add them for 64-bit PCI.
Btw, if you add per-device flags, please add a central "block device
busy"-flag:
* raw-io does not set the blocksize for VFS mounts, but it ignores md
volumes and swap partitions.
* "mount -t ext2 /dev/swappartition" makes swapping unstable.
* an accidential "swapon /dev/root" makes the root volume unusable: ext2
tries to read 1024 bytes, but the sector size was switched to 4096.
