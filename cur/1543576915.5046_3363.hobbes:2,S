Actually the getblock function could be split into 3 functions:
- alloc_block: mostly just decrementing a counter (and quota)
- get_block: allocating a block from the bitmap
- commit_block: inserting the new block into the inode
This would be really useful for streaming, one could get as fast as
possible the block number and the data could be very quickly written,
while keeping the cache usage low. Or streaming directly from a device
to disk also wants to get rid of the data as fast as possible.
bye, Roman
