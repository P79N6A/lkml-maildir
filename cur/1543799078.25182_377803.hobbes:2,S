Besides the fact that I still don't think it's requred, Matt's 
suggestion would work only randomly for functions using more than 1 kB 
stack.
But discussing hypothetical patches is silly - code talks.
If someone sends a patch implementing Mark's suggestion and it gets 
measured that this patch doesn't impose a performance penalty we'd
have a basis for a real discussion.
