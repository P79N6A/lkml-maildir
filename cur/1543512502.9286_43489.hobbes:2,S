You have to handle the PIIX4 by kludge. The $PIR table is set up on the 
basis you are windows and will do this. The BIOS call for getting the table
is known to fail on a whole pile of BIOSen too. Enough that MS don't use
it by default.
On a PC the PIIX4 is provided with a PIIX2 table. Windows loads up a driver
of its own to handle this when it sees the PIIX2 routing table on a PIIX4.
It's also worth noting that Microsoft consider it sufficiently unreliable that
they don't attempt to use any IRQ steering features unless they have to.
