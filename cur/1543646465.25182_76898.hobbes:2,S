That is completely wrong.  I run 2.5.40 on a swapless 8MB 486, and can happily use BASH, Apache with PHP support, Lynx, and JED, all at a useful speed.  I also happily run 2.5.40 on another 4MB RAM 486, with 20MB of swap, and do useful work on it.  If you don't believe me, come to Linux Expo UK next week and see for yourself.

No, the 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels are actively maintained.

Nobody is forcing you to move to 2.4.x from older versions - current code is being actively backported to them.
