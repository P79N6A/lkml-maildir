Well, I think all filesystems can do VM_CAN_NONLINEAR anyway. Device
drivers and "weird" things tend to have trouble...

We probably should keep VM_CAN_NONLINEAR for the moment, I think.
But now that we have the fallback path, we _could_ use that instead of
failing. I doubt anybody will be using nonlinear mappings on anything but
regular files for the time being, but as a trivial fix, I think this probably
should go into 2.6.23.
Thanks for spotting this problem
