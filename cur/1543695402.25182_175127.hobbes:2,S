Hi,
I intensively tested several kernel options and had to install a new kernel 
quite often and since I'm using Lilo also had to re-running lilo rather 
often. However, sometimes (about 30%) it happend after I rebooted that the 
lilo-boot-menu didn't appear but it stopped at 'L' and then filled my screen 
with '9''s.
This only happens with 2.6.0-testX and not with 2.4.X, furthermore I think it 
might be sync related, since it never happend when I manually run the sync 
programm several times aftter I run 'lilo'
Is it a lilo or kernel bug? 
Cheers,
	Bernd
