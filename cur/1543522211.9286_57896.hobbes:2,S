Yes it does matter.  The whole point is that you can't use a "b"
constraint and try to make the compiler put anything into ebx.
Something like the following (untested!) is required
#define _syscall1_pic(type,name,type1,arg1) \
type name(type1 arg1) \
{ \
long __res; \
__asm__ volatile ("push %%ebx\n\t" \
	"mov %%eax,%%ebx\n\t" \
	"mov %1,%%eax"\n\t \
	"int $0x80\n\t" \
	"pop %%ebx" \
        : "=a" (__res) \
        : "i" (__NR_##name),"a" ((long)(arg1))); \
__syscall_return(type,__res); \
}
