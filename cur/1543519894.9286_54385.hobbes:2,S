Hi.
I keep loosing my networking since I have started using the
2.3.x series (2.3.2x+). I have a Dell Latitude CPi A 366
with a 3Com 3CXE589DC card. After some time I get messages
in the log saying "dst cache overflow" and at approximately
the same time I can't initiate new network connections any
more.
I can still use IRC if I'm logged into a server, I can still
fetch mail with netscape. I tried fetchmail and it didn't
seem to have any problems other than a conflict with
netscape trying to fetch the same messages at the same time.
Here's a snippet from my log:
Dec 16 11:20:43 km-lt kernel: KERNEL: assertion (dst!=NULL) 
failed at tcp_output.c(96):tcp_advertise_mss 
This has only been logged a few times (three)
messages:Dec 19 14:40:20 km-lt kernel: spurious 8259A 
interrupt: IRQ7. 
This I have at three different dates but always some time
before the problems arise. I guess this can be normal if
one inserts / ejects the PCMCIA card.
Dec 19 15:16:17 km-lt kernel: dst cache overflow 
Dec 19 15:16:22 km-lt kernel: dst cache overflow 
Dec 19 15:16:30 km-lt kernel: NET: 3 messages suppressed. 
These are all over the place :)
The config is as close to the original RH one that I could
get with 2.3.x.
The only "odd" thing about my usage pattern is that I use
the machine at work, take it home, reconfigure IP and routing
and use it there, take it to work and reconfigure etc.
I don't reboot if I don't have to.
I'll be glad to give more information if needed.
