Subject: [Bug 610] New: Missing include header causes agp compilation to fail on ppc32

           Summary: Missing include header causes agp compilation to fail on
                    ppc32
    Kernel Version: 2.5.68
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: dilinger@voxel.net
Distribution: Debian unstable
Hardware Environment: NewWorld pmac; 7410, altivec supported
Software Environment: gcc version 3.2.3 20030407 (Debian prerelease)
Problem Description: Things including asm/agp.h fail to compile due to missing
header.  Dummy files were added to stuff like asm-sparc64, but not to asm-ppc. 
I   can't verify that this dummy file won't hurt anything, but it worked for me
when I booted up my ppc box into 2.5.68 (using atyfb128) and started X (using
X's rage128 driver).
