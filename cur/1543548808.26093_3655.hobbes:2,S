Could this be a solution for modules that intercept system calls from
"normal" processes ?
Assuming fork() and friends are intercepted, could a
new personality be set which would use-count the module, preventing the
unload-whilst-processes-sleeping problem ? 
I'm unsure whether this lcall7 thing would work at all... would the normal
process still go through ENTRY(system_call) ?
this would be a much nicer solution than use-counting each system call
individually, implying atomic_inc/atomic_dec each time, or making the
module unloadable and providing ioctl()s instead of module parameters.
Is this possible ?
thanks
