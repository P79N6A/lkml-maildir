~# hdparm -d1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
2.6.16.18 gives the same result, am I supposed to try hdparm -d1 
early in the startup scripts, before / gets remounted rw?

>Can you enable DMA in the BIOS?
The IBM pretty BIOS with a bird shaped mouse pointer flapping wings 
as it moves?  ;)  No, the BIOS hasn't much config options.
Installed the ms-dos PS2 utility, no joy there either:
PS2 DISK sets HDD idle standby delay in minutes
PS2 DMA selects DMA channel for audio and printer
Nothing looks like HDD DMA enable in there.  Same HDD in another 
box via IDE adapter does udma2 (well, it wanted to go faster but 
I slowed it down with hdparm -X to suit the HDD spec.).

Perhaps a buglet, why I cc'd Alan.  I'll check if 2.6.17-rc5 boots 
on the thing...
Thanks,
Grant.
