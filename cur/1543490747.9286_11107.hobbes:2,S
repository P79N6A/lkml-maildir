I am running a 2.2.3 kernel and am seeing the following, which I believe to
be a disparity, or at least deserves an explanation.
First, I've increased /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max to 1048560, for my udp
application which receives a large amount of packets.
I use setsockopt(SO_RCVBUF) with an argument of 524280 to increase the
amount of backlog my application can handle while it is off doing other
things.
getsockopt(SO_RCVBUF) returns 262140.  Shouldn't it return 524280?
If I call setsockopt() with another amount, say 131070, I still get 262140
from getsockopt().
Code available upon request. Please CC me.
