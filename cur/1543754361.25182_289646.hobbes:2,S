Fairly unlikely at this point, as the state we have traditionally
reprogrammed the i8259 to, delivers interrupts to different vectors
than the firmware uses.   So I don't see how telling it not
to deliver interrupts where the firmware won't expect them
is likely to change things.
It could be that ACPI AML code is trying something at an inappropriate 
time.  But I can not even find the ACPI soft power code path.  pm_power_off
never seems to get hooked. 
Or it could one of the other kexec related patches for all I know.
Until I get a good data point or a reproducer I can't do anything.
It doesn't even make sense to drop the patch because then
I won't get a good data point.  And I won't know if similar symptoms
crop of if I need to do something else.
