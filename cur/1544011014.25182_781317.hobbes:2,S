Hmm, if I'm understanding you correctly, adding ref counts explicitly 
(like you suggest below)  would be used to let a lower layer defer 
writes.  Seems like this could be just as easily done with explicits 
kmallocs and transferring ownership of the allocated memory to the 
in-kernel representation handling layer below (which in turn queues the 
data structures for writes).
Any such layer would probably need to hold references to objects 
enqueued for write-out, so they will still a full cleanup path in case 
of success/error/abort (which means that any advantage of creating a 
pool of allocations for O(1) cleanup disappears).
Reference counting these guys doesn't have a clear advantage to me. 
They seem to have a pretty linear lifetime.
