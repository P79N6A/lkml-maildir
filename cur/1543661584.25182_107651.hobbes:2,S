I believe the problem is related to Redhat's use of partition labels
by default on 7.x and 8.x.   Makes it easy if the drives master/slave 
changes but causes problems for other things like this.  
For example, my /etc/fstab looks like: 
LABEL=/        /            ext3    defaults        1 1
LABEL=/boot    /boot        ext2    defaults        1 2
LABEL=/home    /home        ext3    defaults        1 2
/dev/hda3      swap         swap    defaults        0 0
/dev/cdrom     /mnt/cdrom   iso9660 noauto,owner,kudzu,ro 0 0
Attempting to boot a system with two drives (or multiple partitions on
the same drive) configured like this will confuse the system.  So the
first step would be to change the LABEL= lines to /dev/<device>  (i.e.
/dev/hda1      /boot ......etc.)
Next issue is how you want to boot the two systems.  One boot partition
or two?  With one boot, make a copy of what is already there, then
install the new system, allowing it to overwrite the old.  Then merge
the two boot partitions by hand.  They will already be a different
kernels, etc. so it shouldn't be too hard.  
Then I would recommend booting the second system or mounting its drives
in the first temporarily and making similar changes to its fstab that we
did to the first.  
Then reboot and I believe it should work....
Good luck,
Dave V.
