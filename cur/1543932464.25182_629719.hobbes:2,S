It appears that this patch is missing from the latest 2.6.24 git
kernel as well as the 2.6.24-rc5-mm1 patch?
> Mike, This issue still seems to be present in linus git tree. Perhaps
> the fix in -mm not pushed to mainline yet.

> Can you please raise the flag with Andrew, so that he can push it before
> 2.6.24 gets out

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] x86: fix show cpuinfo cpu number always zero
Content-Disposition: inline; filename=cpuinfo_x86-fix
This fix corrects the problem that early_identify_cpu() sets
cpu_index to '0' (needed when called by setup_arch) after
smp_store_cpu_info() had set it to the correct value.
The error shows up in 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' will all cpus = 0.
