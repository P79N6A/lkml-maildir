Forgive me if I'm asking a stupid question, but did this actually make a
difference in the inode size? On gcc 2.95 and 3.3, if MAXQUOTAS is zero,
gcc will silently elide that struct member. (Though it will leave a
residue of sorts behind -- it participates as far as structure field
alignment is concerned, but that isn't an issue here.) I believe
zero-length arrays are actually an ANSI C thing, but I didn't see it in
a quick perusal of my K&R.
Or, hmm... <does grep> Oh, MAXQUOTAS is set to 2 unconditionally in
include/linux/quota.h. How about putting the #ifdef's in there, and
setting it to zero if CONFIG_QUOTA is not set? That'd localize the
preprocessor noise.
Like this (compiled with CONFIG_QUOTA unset, but not booted):
Shrink struct inode by two pointers if CONFIG_QUOTA is unset.
