Russell's patches do not address this.
Individual PCMCIA drivers need to be updated to call
thier release function directly when processing a
CARD_RELEASE message instead of from a timer procedure.
Similar to this patch for synclink_cs.c:

The timer link->release is initialized with the release
function (in this case mgslpc_release, but called something
else in your driver). Now it is called directly.
