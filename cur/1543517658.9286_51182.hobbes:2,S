                         The ALSA professional team
                                      
   [2nd December 1999, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic]
   
   The ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) professional team has
   been founded. The team has two members: Jaroslav Kysela from Czech
   Republic, the ALSA team leader, and Abramo Bagnara from Italy. These
   members are employed by SuSE to work full-time on the ALSA project.
   The primary goals for the near future are to finish API development
   within two months and to ensure the merge into the official Linux
   kernel tree. After this, the main effort will be towards the
   continuous improvement of the ALSA sound API and addition of more
   lowlevel drivers for common soundcards available in the current
   market.
