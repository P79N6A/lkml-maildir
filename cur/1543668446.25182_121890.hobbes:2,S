Be very careful here.  While you better not _use_ overlapping
partitions, a partition table with overlapping partitions is
a traditional UNIX default.  It is usually something like
	part	start	length
	a	0	3/8 drive
	b	3/8	1/8 drive
	c	0	whole drive
	d	0	1/3 drive
	e	1/3	1/3 drive
	f	2/3	1/3 drive
	g	1/3	2/3 drive
	h	1/2	1/2 drive
In this way admins wouldn't repartition, just use the default
partitions in suitable combinations.  This actually reduced
the likelihood of overlapping partitions because the
partitioning tools were sometimes confusing causing custom
partition to have 1 cylinder overlaps.  When drives got to be
larger than 2GB these default partition sizes became
increasingly pointless.
