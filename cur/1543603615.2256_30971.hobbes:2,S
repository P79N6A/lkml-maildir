Correlating file timestamps with an event log.  Comparing timestamps
on different files (make).  Real time is _much_ more useful (not to
mention convenient) than a generation count; and given that we've
survived with second resolution so far, I think the hypothetical
collisions on a nanosecond scale are ignorable.
