In the new slim code, which we haven't sent out but will soon, we added
the unix_may_send and unix_stream_connect hooks. The unix_may_send hook
prevents a demoted process from sending data on a higher integrity
socket; and the unix_may_connect hook prevents a process from
connecting to a lower integrity socket.  The integrity level of the
socket is based on the integrity of the file associated with the Unix
domain socket.
The bottom line is that although we don't demote the pending socket
and would allow it to connect at the higher integrity, we simply don't
allow anything of lesser integrity to be sent over it.
