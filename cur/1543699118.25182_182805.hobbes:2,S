No, 16 devices are normal, sysfs has only one:
aj@simulacron:~/torrent/j-tv/download$ ls /dev/floppy/
0       0u1120  0u1600  0u1722  0u1760  0u1920  0u720  0u820
0u1040  0u1440  0u1680  0u1743  0u1840  0u360   0u800  0u830
aj@simulacron:~/torrent/j-tv/download$ find /sys/block/fd* -name dev
/sys/block/fd0/dev
Are those floppy devices obsolete? fdformat was the only app to use
them anyway, I guess. (Not that I use my floppy, I simply noticed
the change.)

how many bug reports did you see in the last three months of people
having problems with devfs? I don't doubt the problems in theory, but
but I simply haven't seen them happening. Most users seem quite happy.
