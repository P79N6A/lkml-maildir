i was thinking it would be nice to have show_regs show the EIP and
call traceback for all processors in an SMP configuration, not just the
interrupted processor.
it's easy enough to replace kbd_pt_regs with an array of pointers to
struct pt_regs, and print the contents during a sysreq.  but how could i
grab the stack frame on the other CPUs?
perhaps the keyboard interrupt could instead trigger an IPI to all
processors in the configuration which causes them to dump their stack
frame on the console.
comments?  anyone already have a patch that does this?
