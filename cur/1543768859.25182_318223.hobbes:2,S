You cannot use rdtsc for anything but rough instruction timing. The
timers for different processors run at different speeds on some SMP
systems, the timer rates vary as processors change clock rate nowdays.
Rdtsc may also jump dramatically on a suspend/resume.
If the app uses rdtsc then generally speaking its terminally broken. The
only exception is some profiling tools.
