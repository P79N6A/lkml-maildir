Sorry for bothering you. I'm trying to work out a scheme for
transitioning most of the DRM() macros out of the DRM source without
breaking everything. Right now I can get rid of all but six uses.  I
was going to fix this one in the next pass and I needed a solution to
keep everything working for the moment. I was focused on the point of
the error and didn't think about fixing it at a higher level.
