   I know a number of people that run their mylex cards in jbod mode and 
use software raid;-)

   You're thinking of it the wrong way.  You just create a bunch of 
partitions and make them into raid devices.  You shouldn't be using the 
entire disk or you will break autodetection.

   Lilo deals well with raid 1 devices.  I typical create a small raid 1 
mirror as /boot.  Just be sure to install your bootloader on to all 
drives.  Newer versions of lilo will do the right thing if told to use 
/dev/mdwhatever.
