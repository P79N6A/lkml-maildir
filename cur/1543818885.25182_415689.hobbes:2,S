Walking the DT means we need to hardcode it on PCI IDs, since the Apple
OF doesn't give the Airport device a logical name. It's probably easier
to implement than walking PCI, but we'd need to maintain a table. My
vote is for PCI walking, I'll give that a shot over the weekend.

Yep, that should be rare enough.
