Hello !
since ECC (speaking in terms of ram/memory) is some widespread hardware
technology
within server/enterprise computing for protection of memory failure,  i
wonder:
Can`t this be done in software, too ?
I didn`t find a referenc on this list, but i found an interesting paper i'd
like to share at:
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/softecc
:ddopson-meng/softecc_ddopson-meng.pdf
"SoftECC : A System for Software Memory Integrity Checking"
Is it possible to implement something like this within the Linux virtual
memory subsystem ?
If it can be done, wouldn`t this be a great feature ?
regards
Roland K.
system engineer
