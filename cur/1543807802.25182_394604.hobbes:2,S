Actually looking at it again "v" should be aligned to 4 bytes anyways, so
there is a unused 2 byte hole that you can use for this.
Still think the way of converting the policy is more elegant though.

MPOL_INTERLEAVE isn't strict, so it can never cause OOMs unless the complete
system is out of memory. It just changes which node is tried first.

Do you have enough new thoughts on it for one?

Would be good.
