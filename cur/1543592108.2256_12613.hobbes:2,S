However Linus please note that in the case of the bould arrays
used in device handling code we have code patterns like this:
	if (blah[major]) {
		size = blah[major][minor]
	} else
		size = some default;
And those have to by dragged throughout the whole places where
the arrays get used. Thus making some wrappers (many are already in
place):
1. Prevents typo kind of programming errors.
2. Possibly make the code more explicit.
and please don't forget:
3. Allows to change the underlying implementation in some soon point in
time.
However I agree that *without* the above arguments such kind of wrappers
would make the overall code as unreadable as C++ code frequently is,
which
tryies to preserve private: attributes at simple field cases..
