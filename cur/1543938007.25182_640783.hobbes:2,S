It's probably been this way for a long time, and I'm just noticing, but
I can't seem to find the create() (among others) pointer for NFS filesystems.
Specifically, If I look at sb->s_root->d_inode->i_op there's no create
there. How do I find it? I'm guessing that the ability to share mount
structures between multiple NFS mounts resulted in some kind of fake
superblock, but I just can't figure out where to find the functions.
