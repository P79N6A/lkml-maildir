The average user and lkml reader, perhaps. But I don't understand
why Linus refuses to use proper -preX/-rcX naming, it would
clear up a lot of confusion imho. It's just the logical thing
to do, Marcelo gets it completely right. That -rcX and -rcX+1
differ in what they mean is really confusing and opposite of
basically anything else out there.
With the 2.6.x-release tree and proper -pre/-rc naming, I would
be perfectly happy :-)
