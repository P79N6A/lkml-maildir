Not necessarily. Imagine suspending to disk in order to replace a faulty
card. That could be way faster and less disruptive than shutting down
normally and loosing caches and so on.
Irrespective of the above, servers tend not to have too much in the way
of hardware unique to them anyway, and even if you don't find it useful,
that's not to say others won't want it.
