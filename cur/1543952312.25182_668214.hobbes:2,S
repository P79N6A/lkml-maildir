Panics hooking up to an x86 mac mini in target disk mode are gone on my end 
with this patch added, and the fix makes sense -- assuming I've got it right, 
in my head, of course. ;)
As I understand it, we'll now simply bail in handle_at_packet when we see 
packet == NULL, rather than trying to play with already freed memory, and 
cancelling an AT packet here should always be perfectly safe, because we're 
already onto the AR side of this transaction, and in most cases, the AT 
handler already fired anyway.
