Subject: klibc - another libc?

After several mentions of klibc recently, I want to ask a question.
I understand all the kernel-mode cleanups -- moving initialization
from kernel to user space is a very good thing.
But the question really is: why yet another libc?  We already have
dietlibc, uclibc, glibc, now klibc...  With modern kernel, initramfs
will very probably contain quite some programs linked with glibc
(modprobe/insmod, mdadm/lvm, etc; I highly suggest putting some
minimal text editor like nvi there too, for rescue purposes) --
so why not have an option to use whatever libc is available on
the host platform?
In the other words, kinit/ipconfig/nfsmount/etc stuff is ok,
no questions.  But the libc itself -- what for?
And another related question: why not dietlibc which is already
here, for quite long time?
Thanks.
