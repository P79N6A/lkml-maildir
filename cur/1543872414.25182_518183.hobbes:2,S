Ok, I've now disabled sched_yield (I'm using xorg radeon drivers).

good = no problems
ok = noticeable latency
bad = hard to use
awful = completely unusable
By the way, make -j5 is my usual kernel compile because it gives me
the best wall time on this box. 
A priori, this load should be manageable by RSDL as the interactive
loads are all pretty small. So I wrote a little Python script that
basically continuously memcpys some 16MB chunks of memory:
#!/usr/bin/python
a = "a" * 16 * 1024 * 1024
while 1:
    b = a[1:] + "b"
    a = b[1:] + "c"
I've got 1.5G of RAM, so I can run quite a few of these without
killing my pagecache. This should test whether a) Beryl's actually
running up against memory bandwidth issues and b) whether "simple"
static loads work. As you can see, running 5 instances of this script
leaves me in good shape still. 10 is still in "ok" territory, with top
showing each getting 9.7-10% of the CPU. 15 starts to feel sluggish.
20 the mouse jumps a bit and I got an MP3 skip. 30 is getting pretty
bad, but still not as bad as the make -j 5 load.
My suspicion is the problem lies in giving too much quanta to
newly-started processes.
