This is enough, I think, although I'd also like to get the output from 
/sbin/lspci just to clarify what the devices are.
In 2.6.8 (working), you had:
	1080-10bf : 0000:00:0d.0
	  1080-1087 : ide2
	  1088-108f : ide3
	  1090-10bf : PDC20267
	10c0-10cf : 0000:00:14.1
	  10c0-10c7 : ide0
	  10c8-10cf : ide1
while in the nonworking setup the PCI code allowed 0:14.1 to be allocated 
_inside_ device 0:0d.0, like this:
	1080-10bf : 0000:00:0d.0
	  10a0-10af : 0000:00:14.1
	    10a0-10a7 : ide0
	    10a8-10af : ide1
which looks rather bogus. In fact, it looks like the device was mis-setup 
by the BIOS, and that the PCI resource changes allowed that broken setup.
The reason for that is the change in "arch/i386/pci/i386.c" to use 
"insert_resource()" instead of "request_resource()", which in turn is 
because we wanted to insert PCI resources _inside_ the system resources 
reserved by ACPI.
HOWEVER, we do _not_ want to allow insertion of PCI resources inside other 
PCI resources, and while this normally shouldn't happen, it definitely can 
happen if the BIOS has set things up incorrectly in the first place. As 
appears to be the case in your setup.
Now, the reason for using "insert_resource()" in arch/i386/pci/i386.c 
should go away with Shaohua Li's patch, so I'd love to hear if applying 
Li's patch _and_ making the "insert_resource()" be a "request_resource()" 
fixes the problem for you.
I bet it will.
Greg, we kind of left the ACPI resource management breakage pending, and 
clearly we need some resolution. Comments?
