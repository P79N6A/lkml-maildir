You probably have a Soundblaster Live or similar, which has multiple
hardware wave outputs.
OSS has software mixing. ALSA seems designed for people relying on
esd, aRts or similar multiplexing daemons.
It's possible to run a program via 'esddsp' or 'artsdsp' to reroute
/dev/dsp to the daemon, but the overhead isn't so nice, and the output
quality is often wanting.
