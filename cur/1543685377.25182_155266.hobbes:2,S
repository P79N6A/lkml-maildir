It depends on the part of Europe. Not incidentally, in the countries
you mention, all foreign content shown on televison and in movie
theaters is dubbed. In other countries such as the Scandinavian
countries, The Netherlands and Belgium, almost everything is
sub-titled. I think there is a direct relation between dubbing and the
lack of English language skills.
