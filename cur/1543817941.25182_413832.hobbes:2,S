Probably doesn't make much difference, but I'd rather do the nopage
check first, as that will obviously be the most common.

I first thought this might be a good idea because some archs have a
pretty heavy-weight set_pte_at (eg. powerpc, which is even heavier if
it is to replace an existing entry). This is not going to be very
common, but there have been cases where multiple threads all try to
fault in a particular page, which has caused performance problems.
Other than that, you never know what a nopfn handler will want to do,
so I think it is better to be consistent with other faults. Shouldn't
need much more than a `if (pte_none()) { /* do it */ }`.
