Well, not so sure about that. What if one of your expected uses for example 
is video data storage -- lots of data, especially for multiple streams, and 
needs still relatively fast machinery. Why would you care for the overhead 
af _small_ blocks?
Okay, maybe that's covered in the "in general" but its not extremely oddball 
either...
