Looks 'obviously correct' to me (famous last words). I can't try it
on the system that is otherwise entropy-short as I don't want to
touch the kernel on that box right now.
As I said to you by private email, I have a slight preference for
a /proc controlled version (just so vendor-distributed precompiled
kernels could work either way, with the vendor-dist rc script
chosing a default option based on the vendor config script) given
coding /proc entries is trivial (see manual patch :-). However, your
patch is many many times better than the status quo IMHO.
