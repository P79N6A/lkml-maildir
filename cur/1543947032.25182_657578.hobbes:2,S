Yeah, you are probably right.  We have found that the system is *extremely* touchy on how much overhead we have in the lock-acquisition path.  For instance, using a non-inline version of adaptive_wait() can cost 5-10% in disk-io throughput.  So we were trying to find places to shave anywhere we could.  That being said, I didn't record any difference from this patch, so you are probably exactly right.  It just seemed like "the right thing to do" so I left it in.
