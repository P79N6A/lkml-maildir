What regressions are you referring to? The SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN
regression patch you sent is being merged. What else?
And FWIW, I don't like the patch because it makes the code very hairy.
But I don't see why we shouldn't merge SLUB fast-path optimizations if
they're clean and you have the numbers to show it's a gain even if
there are other remaining regressions.
