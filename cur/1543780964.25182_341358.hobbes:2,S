Well, it is a departure from our current idea of balancing.
I would prefer to use my patch initially to fix the _bug_
you found, then we can think about changing policy for
power savings.
Main things I'm worried about:
Idle time regressions that pop up any time we put
restrictions on balancing.
This can tend to unbalance memory controllers (eg. on POWER5,
CMP Opteron) which can be a performance problem on those
systems.
Lastly, complexity in the calculation.
