Hi all,
In the linux system , kernel is often starting up like this :
bootloader -> start_32() -> start_kernel() -> init()
i would like to ask what is the piority level in this starting procedure 
? 0 or 3 ? that means, this start up process are running in kernel space 
or user space ?  or the level is keep changing ?
If it is in kernel space from the very beginning , at which point the 
system is switched into user space ? is it at the time when kernel open 
the shell ?
I am new to linux, hope someone can help me here.
Regards,
TOM
