That's *precisely* what I just explained above!
You create that special device at the time of pps_register_source()!

No, it does *NOT*. All it says is:
    The time_pps_create() is used to convert an already-open UNIX file
    descriptor, for an appropriate special file, into a PPS handle.
See? What I said is precisely the implementation the RFC envisages
(and the only sane way to implement it too).
And later, where it gives an example, it shows:
    fd = open(PPSfilename, O_RDWR, 0);
What I'm saying is that the "PPSfilename", as is obvious from the name
itself, is *not* a port such as lpXXX or ttySXXX, but an "appropriate
special file" corresponding to a ... PPS source! Really, the RFC is
quite clear and easy to read, I have no idea how to explain that more
clearly ...

Yes.

That's trivial to implement in the kernel code for the time_pps_create()
syscall.

Nopes, the RFC is not broken at all. All this physical-connection-port
device vs PPS-source-device confusion is just in your mind :-)

Yeah, so how am I not RFC compliant? Userspace will *only* open(2) the
special char device of the *PPS source*, and have *nothing* to do with
the device corresponding to the physical device/port it is connected
through!

It is not ...

No, I don't need any "second device". I *only* need the "appropriate
special file" as mentioned in the RFC. I don't give a *damn* for
what *physical device/port* the source is actually connected through.
I suggest you should read the RFC again ...
