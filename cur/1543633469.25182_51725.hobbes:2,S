Well the question is then how will things look without commas? I suppose 
if we have very complex things and prevent using commas whereas I don't 
assert that we do for text but this is just a bloat example it's good to 
have things like commas allowed even though we are in case we won't allow 
them there talking about file names.
If we allow commas all over the filesystem and likewise say that there is 
nothing to mention about it why should we refuse them for kbuild 
especially since there is a parallel system which allows commas?
Regards
Thunder
