how much CPU time is X using, and how often does it reschedule? For
CPU-intensive tasks we definitely 'favor' higher priority processes and
distribute them amongst CPUs nicely. But if X in the above testcase isnt
CPU-intensive and/or does heavy reschedules then it's hard to tell.
i have tested this on a 4-CPU box, 4 reniced and 4 'normal' processes, and
CPUs nicely take 1 'normal' and 1 reniced process each.

Note that even with your patch we are not correct. Yes we favor a +20
process against a +0 process because 20+0 > 0+0+1. But a +20 process
couldnt win against a +10 (still reniced) process because +20+0 <
+10+10+1. Also, p->counter can be considered randomly rotating, which
introduces unexpected non-scheduling as well.

i suspect that in your case X is rescheduling heavily. If so then this is
a feature: we want to preserve the 'connection' between those two
processes. (look at the related() thing in sched.c)
