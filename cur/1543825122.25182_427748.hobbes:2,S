Five minutes of research and I found this:
http://www.asus.com.tw/products4.aspx?modelmenu=2&model=952&l1=3&l2=14&l3=245
It indicates that the board, although using an nForce 410 chipset, does NOT 
use NVIDIA ethernet, but (quote) "Relatek RTL8201CL external PHY"; you're 
probably trying the wrong driver and this is the source of the problem.
This info could be wrong, but I thought it might help.
