Given that this is the Linux Kernel Mailing List (lkml), as opposed to the
Linux Mailing List, I fail to see how anyone subscribed could fail to note
the distinction.
You are preaching to the wrong people. When people on this list talk about
Linux, they are talking about Linux. They are talking about the kernel
itself. Unless you'd like to claim credit on behalf of GNU for inspiring the
kernel, as well? (straw man, feel free to ignore)
(inflammatory) Now, I've noticed that everyone else involved in this
discussion is also submitting and commenting on patches to the kernel
source, while you have done nothing but preach about how awesome GNU is.
Fine. GNU rulz, man. Now, do you actually have any Linux Kernel subject
matter?
