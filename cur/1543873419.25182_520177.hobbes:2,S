I'm not sure I follow what you're doing -- why isn't asyncfd merely calling 
io_getevents() instead of reinventing everything the ringbuffer does?  The 
aio ringbuffer is already locked in memory.  Fwiw, the aio ringbuffer was 
originally wired up to a file descriptor, but that gave way to the actual 
syscall in order to enforce proper typechecking and typical usage scenarios 
with timeouts.
Also, there have been patches floating around for aio_poll and a way to get 
epoll wakeups into the aio event queue.  They deserve serious consideration 
if this asyncfd seems necessary.
