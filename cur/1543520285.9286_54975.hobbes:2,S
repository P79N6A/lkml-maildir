Hi all,
I saw a post sometime back about a bug with the Intel EtherXpress cards
that could make them do something along the lines of spewing out messages
saying 'Attempting to restart the transceiver' or something like that. 
There is apparantly another driver around for this card. Where can I get
this driver, and are there plans to integrate it into the stable kernel?
Thanks,
