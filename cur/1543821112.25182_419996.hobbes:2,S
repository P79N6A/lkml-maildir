Thanks for your comments.  Here is an updated patch.
Make rtc-dev work well on 64-bit platforms with 32-bit userland.  On
those platforms, users might try to read 32-bit integer value.  This
patch make rtc-dev's read() work well for both "int" and "long" size.
This tweak is came from genrtc driver.
