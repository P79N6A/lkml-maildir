Argumentum ad Hominem now ... we'll get them all eventually.
Since you won't post the usage code, just answer this: how does what
you're doing with idr differ from its originally designed consumer: the
posix timers which also do the idr_remove() in IRQ context?
To me it seems your argument applies to this case as well, but you
didn't quote it when asked for an example, so I assume there's some
difference that I don't understand.
