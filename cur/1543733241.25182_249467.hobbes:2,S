I would not mention SMP at that stage, but most of the existing code on IA32 
suumes that all CPUs run with the same frequency. I only heared that at least on 
Alphas this is not true. Probably you'll need a per-CPU state regarding time. Most 
likely resulting in the "local CPU's time" and a global concept of time that 
should not be in contradiction with any CPU's time. That might mean that any 
process always has to query the global time, involving extra overhead.
You mentioned it...
