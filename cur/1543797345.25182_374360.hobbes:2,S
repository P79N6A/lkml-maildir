Another thing - bunch of input code currently creates platform devices
but does not create corresponding platform drivers (because they don't
support suspend/resume or shutdown and probing is done right there in
module init function).
What is the genral policy on platform devices? Should they always have
a corresponding driver ir it is OK to leave them without one?
