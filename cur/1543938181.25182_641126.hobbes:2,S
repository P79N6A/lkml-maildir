This doesn't build on sparc64.
The percpu_modcopy() removal from include/asm-sparc64/percpu.h
leaked into patch #3 instead of being done here in patch #1
where it belongs (so that this series is properly bisectable).
It also seems that the include/asm-x86/percpu_{32,64}.h defines
aren't removed in this patch either.
