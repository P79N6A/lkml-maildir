This is only marginally on-topic (at best), but I agree the army is a very 
bad model for distributed collaborative development organization to try to 
emulation.  I have in fact written a series about this back when I wrote 
stock market investment columns (strange hobby for a programmer, I know...)

Linux development is a fan club.  And if you don't think fan clubs can 
mobilize and coordinate truly huge amounts of effort, you've obviously never 
been to worldcon.
But "the prototype and the fan club" is a seperate thing.  Maybe if 
somebody's really really bored I'll give them that talk during a BOF at LWE...
