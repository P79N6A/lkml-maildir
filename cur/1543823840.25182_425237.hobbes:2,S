I looked at that also, but it isn't clear from the use of "b_size" here
that there is any constraint that b_size is a power of two, only that it
is a multiple of 512.  Granted, I don't know whether there are any users
of such a crazy thing, but the fact that this is in bytes instead of a
shift made me think twice.

This in fact exists virtually identically in blkdev.h::blksize_bits()
which I had a look at, but worried a bit about b_size != 2^n and also
the fact that this has branches and/or loop unwinding vs. the fixed
shift operations.

I was thinking exactly the same thing myself.

My thought was that the gratuitous 64-bit multiply in the 32-bit case
was offset by the fact that the comparison is easy.  In the 64-bit case
we are already doing a 64-bit multiply so the goal is to make the
comparison as cheap as possible.
In the end, I don't really care about the exact mechanics of the check...
Cheers, Andreas
