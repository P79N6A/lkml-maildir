That's correct.

It is significant, and I am trying to figure out a nice clean way to allow
_all_ stackable filesystems (yes, ecryptfs which is in vanilla has the same
problem too) to have data modified under them without any cache incoherence.

That statement is meant to scare people away from modifying the lower fs :)
I tortured unionfs quite a bit, and it can oops but it takes some effort.

Not in the code in the 20-odd patches, it is a minimal version of the code,
maade to be as clean as possible. I hope to   port the  more complex
features into this code when things like lower branch manipulation are fixed
in a real way - there have been suggestions of (ab)using inotify to keep
track of the lower files, but I would prefer to find a real solution.
