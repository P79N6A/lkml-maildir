Hi,
Let me clarify :
The following scenario, in debugfs :
a_dentry = debugfs_create_dir("a", NULL);
b_dentry = debugfs_create_dir("b", a_dentry);
Then, in a shell :
cd /mnt/debugfs/a/b
And, from within the kernel :
debugfs_remove(b_dentry);
debugfs_remove(a_dentry);
If you need an example to see for yourself, here is a _quick and dirty_ one :
-- BEGIN ---
/* test-debugfs.c
 *
 */
#include <linux/marker.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/proc_fs.h>
#include <linux/sched.h>
#include <linux/debugfs.h>
#include <asm/ptrace.h>
static struct dentry *root_dentry;
static struct dentry *a_dentry;
static int my_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
	struct dentry *local_dentry;
	printk("create\n");
	local_dentry = debugfs_create_dir("a", root_dentry);
	if (local_dentry == NULL)
		return -EEXIST;
	else
		a_dentry = local_dentry;
	return -EPERM;
}
static int my_open2(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
	printk("remove\n");
	debugfs_remove(a_dentry);
	return -EPERM;
}
static struct file_operations my_operations_a = {
	.open = my_open,
};
static struct file_operations my_operations_b = {
	.open = my_open2,
};
int init_module(void)
{
	struct proc_dir_entry *pentry = NULL;
	root_dentry = debugfs_create_dir("test2", NULL);
	if (root_dentry == NULL)
		return -EEXIST;
	pentry = create_proc_entry("test-create", 0444, NULL);
	if (pentry)
		pentry->proc_fops = &my_operations_a;
	pentry = create_proc_entry("test-remove", 0444, NULL);
	if (pentry)
		pentry->proc_fops = &my_operations_b;
	return 0;
}
void cleanup_module(void)
{
	remove_proc_entry("test-create", NULL);
	remove_proc_entry("test-remove", NULL);
	debugfs_remove(root_dentry);
}

Sequence :
insmod test-debugfs.ko
cat /proc/test-create
cd /mnt/debugfs/test2/a
cat /proc/test-remove
cd /
ls /mnt/debugfs : you still see test2.

I am not providing a "strace" because I am talking of simplefs_rmdir,
from libfs, which is meant to be used from within the kernel.

The 
struct inode_operations simple_dir_inode_operations = {
        .lookup         = simple_lookup,
};
seems to be populated only with the lookup, (not with rmdir, unlink, etc..).
Therefore, as the simple_rmdir and simple_unlink functions are exported with the
primary goal of being called directly (not through the VFS layer). If the goal
is to use them through the VFS, that's fine with me, but I guess their inode
operations should be exported differently, through the
simple_dir_inode_operations.
