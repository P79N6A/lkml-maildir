The Robin requirements and the need to schedule are the source of the
complications indeed.
I posted all the KVM patches using mmu notifiers, today I reposted the
ones to work with your V2 (which crashes my host unlike my last
simpler mmu notifier patch but I also changed a few other variable
besides your mmu notifier changes, so I can't yet be sure it's a bug
in your V2, and the SMP regressions I fixed so far sure can't explain
the crashes because my KVM setup could never run in do_wp_page nor
remap_file_pages so it's something else I need to find ASAP).
Robin, if you don't mind, could you please post or upload somewhere
your GPLv2 code that registers itself in Christoph's V2 notifiers? Or
is it top secret? I wouldn't mind to have a look so I can better
understand what's the exact reason you're sleeping besides attempting
GFP_KERNEL allocations. Thanks!

The last refcount is released by the invalidate_range itself.

The pte is already marked dirty (and this is the case only for
get_user_pages, regular linux writes don't fault unless it's
explicitly writeprotect, which is mandatory in a few archs, x86 not).
