This is just for users' convenience, i believe you must think 0xff and
0xFF are the same.

Assume you are a user of /proc/acpi/wakeup, when you
cat /proc/acpi/wakeup, you only get PCI bus id, then you need use PCI
bus id to get the device info, that is platform-specific, if you want to
use this PCI bus id to get the device info from another machines, that
is absolutely impossible, but it is ok if it is PCI ID.
Moreover, you can very easily get the device info
from /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids.
grep <PCI ID> /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids
That is more convenient than PCI bus id.
If we can provide PCI ID in /proc/acpi/wakeup, why we let users get that
from /sys/devices/pci...?
