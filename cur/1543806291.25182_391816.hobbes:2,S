The codepath you see in that backtrace is only hit during load or
removal of the 'ip_conntrack' module.  While this certainly still should
not oops, your description of 'not doing anything but IMAP reading' is
certainly not true.  
Could you please describe what actually happened when that bug happened?
It looks to me that you were unloading ip_conntrack_netlink.ko followed
by ip_conntrack.ko.
