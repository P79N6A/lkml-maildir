  The fork() manpage says:
EAGAIN fork cannot allocate sufficient memory to copy the
parent's page tables and allocate a task  structure
for the child.
  No word about limits. But that may classify as a manpage problem.

  I can think only of some applications retrying when they get EAGAIN...

  On workstation or multi-user server yes. But not on, say, web server.
There hitting the limit is a problem and administrator should do something
about it. When your nightly processing job hits limit (and when you run it
by hand, it doesn't) , "Something wrong" is not to much helpful to solve the
problem.

  But WHICH limit. This is what this is all about. If there was only one,
then it is OK. And you cannot even display the limit/usage for running
process to give you a hint.
