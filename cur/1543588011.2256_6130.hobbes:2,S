I don't want to open any old wounds, but I just got a summary from a
colleague of mine, Dan Tsafrir, who measured the context switch overhead 
on Linux with multiple processes. 
You can find the document at:
http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dants/linux-2.2.18-context-switch.ps
The measurements were taken on a quad Pentium III 550MHz IBM NetFinity
server with 1GB RAM. 
Even though this was done on the older 2.2.18 kernel, this is quite
intereseting with regard to the current scheduler discussion.
