This is just getting confusing.
Emmanuel Fust.  Please play with /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity by hand and
confirm that you can move your irqs.  This will confirm it is the decision
part.
Darrick.  The cpu hotplug architecture makes it impossible to properly
call irq migration code that backs /proc/irq/*/smp_affinity.  Therefore
the cpu hotplug interface to irq migration is broken by design.  There
are some other bugs in the implementation of migrating irqs off of cpus
as well.  I'm pretty certain that some combination of those problems is
biting you.
