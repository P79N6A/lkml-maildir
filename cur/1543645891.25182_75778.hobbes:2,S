sched_yield() sementics changed a lot.  It used to mean "take a quick
nap", but it now means "go to the back of the runqueue and stay there
for absolutely ages".  The latter is a closer interpretation of the spec,
but it has broken stuff which was tuned to the old behaviour.
It's not really clear why that yield is in there at all?  Unless that
code is really, really slow (milliseconds) then probably it should just
be deleted.
If there really is a solid need to hand the CPU over to some now-runnable
higher-priority process then a cond_resched() will suffice.
