Not to switch gears on you, but...
I have a "fix", through some feedback from the fedora-legacy-project list I was directed to send the command 'noapic' at boot time.  To see if this would have some effect on the IPv4 problem.
This allowed IPv4 to operate with the SMP kernel!!!
So, can anyone explane what is going on with this...
Is it my motherboard/bios having communication issues with the SMP kernel, but not with the non-SMP kernel?
Thanks, Denis, for you assistance with this issue.
