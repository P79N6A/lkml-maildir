Right.  And if you're an automated program trying to clean up after a *bug*,
what do you do?  It's quite likely that somebody's borked a lock - in which
case it may even be that the "hung" process is the victim rather than the
culprit, and breaking the lock will just make things worse.  Similar issues
apply to *all* of the resources the wedged process has attached to it.
When these things get posted on lkml, it almost always involves quite a bit
of code introspection and scratching of heads before we figure out how the
system *got* its figurative head wedged into that crevice.  Until you
figure out how it *got* there, a safe cleanup is in general impossible.  And
we haven't seen yet the automatic program that can introspect the code to that
detail - even the Stanford automated checker and sparse and the like are quite the
impressive pieces of work.
