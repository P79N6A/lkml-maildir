Just to report something different, no trouble at all with 2.3.10 and
 pcmcia 3.0.13 final, nor with 2.2.10 (but I can't remember if the 2.2
 cardctl and stuff were built with 3.0.13 or with a snapshot); I have
 a Xircom RBEM56G-100 with the unofficial tulip.c and PCMCIA makefile
 patches from Keith Owens (thanks loads man !).
FWIW, whenever I install the pcmcia bundle the utilities go into a
 2.2 or 2.3 subdir according to the kernel version I am using, this
 because I had problems some time ago with 2.1.xx-built cardmgr wasn't
 able to bring up my modules when I booted into 2.0.36.
