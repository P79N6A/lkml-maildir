Solved!
I looked at the 2.4.20 output and saw ICH2M mentioned in the
output. I then grepped the drivers/ide/pci files for ICH2M
and found I just had to enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX.
In my defense I can only say that the Configure.help
stated that this option only enables extended PIO modes.
So for the record: A Dell Inspiron 8100 Laptop needs
the CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX to enable DMA.
