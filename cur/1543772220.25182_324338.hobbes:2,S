Did you look at sound/i2c/i2c.c?  ALSA has its own i2c implementation,
only 333 lines, due to the kernel i2c core being overly complex for
ALSA's needs.
"Although there is a standard i2c layer on Linux, ALSA has its own i2c
codes for some cards, because the soundcard needs only a simple
operation and the standard i2c API is too complicated for such a
purpose."

)
Personally, I would start with this, then add any needed functionality.
