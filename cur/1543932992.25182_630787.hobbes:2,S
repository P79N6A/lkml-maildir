    [XFS] Initialise current offset in xfs_file_readdir correctly
    
    After reading the directory contents into the temporary buffer, we grab
    each dirent and pass it to filldir witht eh current offset of the dirent.
    The current offset was not being set for the first dirent in the temporary
    buffer, which coul dresult in bad offsets being set in the f_pos field
    result in looping and duplicate entries being returned from readdir.

    [XFS] Fix mknod regression
    
    This was broken by my '[XFS] simplify xfs_create/mknod/symlink prototype',
    which assigned the re-shuffled ondisk dev_t back to the rdev variable in
    xfs_vn_mknod. Because of that i_rdev is set to the ondisk dev_t instead of
    the linux dev_t later down the function.
    
    Fortunately the fix for it is trivial: we can just remove the assignment
    because xfs_revalidate_inode has done the proper job before unlocking the
    inode.
