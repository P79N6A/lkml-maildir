Ok. less restriction without compromising security is a good idea.
Under the premise that bind mounts across namespace should be allowed;
any insight why the "founding fathers" :) allowed only bind
and not recursive bind?  What issue would that create? One can
easily workaround that restriction by manually binding recursively.
So does the recursive bind restriction serve any purpose?
I remember Miklos saying its not a security issue but a
implementation/locking issue. That can be fixed aswell.
