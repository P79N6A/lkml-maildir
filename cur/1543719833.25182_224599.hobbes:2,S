I've experienced the problem where applications need to be swapped back 
in.  It's mainly caused by the dual role my machine has (desktop machine 
when I'm using it, server when it is serving files).   Whenever my 
machine has been sitting idly serving files for a while, when I get 
back, the desktop is slow.  However, there is no need for that, as the 
files are served at low speeds -- there's no real point in caching them 
apart from maybe preventing harddisk wear... the harddisk itself can 
serve these files again faster than they will be needed.
So perhaps it is possible to reduce caching of data that is simply not 
putting stress on the system (the harddisk in this case).  If the 
harddisk is not the bottleneck, it is probably not worth caching.  
Typical examples are letting a box play music all day (and then trying 
to read your mail...), having a webserver on a slow connection or 
watching a large movie file.  None of these really require much caching 
beyond a bit of read-ahead. 
I'm not sure how best to distinguish when something is fast I/O that 
would benefit from caching and when something is slow I/O that the 
harddisk can handle well enough on its own.
