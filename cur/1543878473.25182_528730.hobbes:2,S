Another usage case that really wants to avoid the log replay is if you're
looking at an unknown disk image with a forensics CD such as Helix:

Yes, good forensics always clones the disk image twice (the first clone being
used for nothing but creating second-gen clones for analysis), and in most
cases the forensic analyst can work around the fact that you *do* cause some
changes to the disk image by mounting.  But sometimes, you'd rather be looking
at a possibly inconsistent image than replaying the log  - particularly if
you're looking at a "seized and power plug pulled" image, and you actually
care about things that may have been in the log, like just-erased files.
