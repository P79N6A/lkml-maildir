Adding tens of seconds per build is not acceptable when you're building
a lot of kernels each day.
The beginning of this thread showed a 15 second stall on an Athlon 800,
vs a 1 second startup for the old system. The point now is that
Eric _is_ working on improving the performance. (Which was probably
in another post you missed).

Find a list archive, read the beginning of the thread.
