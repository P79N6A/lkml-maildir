I don't care about read/write in particular.  But we do need some
way to launch asynchronous SCSI commands, and currently read/write
are the only way to do that in bsg.  The reason is to keep multiple
spindles busy at the same time.
How about these new ioctls instead of read/write:
    SG_IO_SUBMIT - start a new blk_execute_rq_nowait()
    SG_IO_TEST   - complete and return a previous req
    SG_IO_WAIT   - wait for a req to finish, interruptibly
Then old write users will instead do ioctl SUBMIT.  Read users will
do TEST for non-blocking fd, or WAIT for blocking.  And SG_IO could
be implemented as SUBMIT + WAIT.
Then we can do compat_ioctl and convert up iovecs out-of-line before
calling the normal functions.
Let me know if you want a patch for this.
