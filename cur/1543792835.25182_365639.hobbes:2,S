Duh.  It's set to 'y' not 'm'.  That will teach me for not reading...sorry

It's up and down like a yoyo (fighting with a faulty DSLAM tonight for a 
stable upstream train speed).  It's up while I am still awake and kicking it.
I saw Adrian Bunks's posting in response to yours, and he stated a config he 
knows that is permitted but doesn't work.  That happens to be the same as 
mine, ie:
USB=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=m
CONFIG_USB_LIBUSUAL=y
and also
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB=m

Didn't edit .config at all...just selected options when the make oldconfig was 
run (and misread, still not sure why I looked for a module when I saw 'y' in 
that .config..)
