Ok I should have said.  Both ends have to be using the type of flow
control your cable is wired for if you are using hardware flow control and you
expect it to work correctly.
If you have the hardware signals wired wrong, depending on how it is actually
wrong, and you are using hardware flow control, anything to nothing can happen.
I have incorrectly tied CTS to gnd(false) on both ends, I have CTS/RTS flow
control enabled, why don't I get any data on either end?
Is there a definition of a fully populated cable? Obviously if all you have
wired it xmit/rcve hardware flow control won't work.
