Well, if msecs_to_jiffies() is the new way of specifying timeouts
we'd have a lot more to fix up in our tree. But something like
a remote control key-up timeout doesn't need much precision.
Generally I see nothing wrong with HZ/4, but something like
HZ*20/1000 could be problematic with small or odd HZ values.
Agreed? Or is it desired that people generally use msecs_to_jiffies()?
