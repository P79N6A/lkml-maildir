We could also make the error handling more permissive, and just check for 
the low 16 bits, which is the part that the CRS spec mentions the actual 
value for. The whole vendor ID of 0x0001 is mentioned int he CRS spec as 
being explicitly chosen exactly because it's invalid.
That said, given that we don't actually reap any benefits from CRS support 
right now *anyway*, I think the right thing to do is disable it by 
default. But it would be interesting to know if this patch makes it work 
on those ATI bridges..
