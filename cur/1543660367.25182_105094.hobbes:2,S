I just booted my spanking new P4 HT PC last night using 2.5.58
and to my dissapointment the enumeration of the ethx devices is
reversed. I have 5 ethernet ports on this; eth0-4 on 2.4.x are now listed
as eth4-0. This is rude.
I immediately pointed a finger at monsieur J Garzik (thinking ethernet,
PCI enumeration hmm) but he has denied any responsibility ;-> ;-> He
thinks it may be the sysfs people.
Can anyone give justification for this? Regardless of justification
can we have some form of backward compatibility flag?
cheers,
jamal
