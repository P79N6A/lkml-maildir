Ok, this should be fixed with the commit I just checked in and pushed 
out.. That said, I don't think you'd be likely to ever be able to 
reproduce it - it looks like a very unlikely race. I think the race 
condition has been there for a long time, and googling doesn't actually 
show anybody else seemingly having ever triggered it.
But in case you care, this is what I committed.

commit 45c18b0bb579b5c1b89f8c99f1b6ffa4c586ba08

    Fix unlikely (but possible) race condition on task->user access
    
    There's a possible race condition when doing a "switch_uid()" from one
    user to another, which could race with another thread doing a signal
    allocation and looking at the old thread ->user pointer as it is freed.
    
    This explains an oops reported by Lukasz Trabinski:
    	
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/462241
    
    We fix this by delaying the (reference-counted) freeing of the user
    structure until the thread signal handler lock has been released, so
    that we know that the signal allocation has either seen the new value or
    has properly incremented the reference count of the old one.
    
    Race identified by Oleg Nesterov.
