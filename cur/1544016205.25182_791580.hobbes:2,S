There are 2 other drivers (thinkpad_acpi and asus-something IIRC) that
want the same infrastructure. So I put that code in
include/linux/delayed-leds.h in my tree, but then I realized I'd need
to coordinate too many maintainers and just inlined it for the
merge. (We do not want to schedule from atomic, right?)
I already have a patch for thinkpad_acpi, but it needs a bit more
testing and perhaps some tweaks by maintainer. So yes, eventually
putting that into shared place is a plan.

I did not realize flush_work() exists/does what I need... sorry.
