Am I going to be treading on anybody's toes if I release a patch for the
sonypi module to add battery and AC power information support?
The reason is thus, to stop the fan spinning all the time on my laptop I
have to use ACPI (I have a Vaio FX-103). It doesn't work great, but it
works...
ACPI can't report battery info. Nor can APM!
You have to use the Programmable Interrupts thing to get them out of the
system. I wrote a program that did this (vaiod) on a polling interval to
set my screen brightness automagically but I would have to poll things
manually. It would be great to do this though /dev/sonypi.
It doesn't look like the code has been updated for ages. So is anybody
going to complain if I do it?
