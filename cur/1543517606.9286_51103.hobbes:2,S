Hi all,
When I boot the Linux system, I get a kernel panic as soon as the system
logger message is displayed on the kernel.
The kernel panic message is
trying to kill idle task....
swapper not syncing.
The only changes i made in the kernel was, allocating some memory in the
ip_input file.
What does the message mean.
Bye,
prakash
