   David told me the patch is not needed and only 2.2.x and 2.4.0-pre are
   affected.
   
    David? 
   
Correct.  The 2.3.x/2.4.x branch of the code had the fix made in
revision 1.71 of net/ipv4/icmp.c which equates to August 8th, 2000
which equates to 2.4.0-test6-pre2 or -pre3. :-)
On the 2.2.x side, 2.2.18 has the fix.  There is one, and only one
change, in that patch, to the file net/ipv4/icmp.c and it is the
fix in question.
It is really unfortunate that the bugtraq reporter failed to even
bother to mention what kernel he was using.  It could have avoided a
lot of the confusion surrounding this (already fixed) bug.
