    It's getting close to 30 for me;  of course, I started using
    computers when source was pretty universally available, so
    the lines weren't quite so firmly drawn.

    All Linux needed was a compiler that worked on the ia32 architecture,
    since that's the architecture that it was originally written on.
    If gcc wasn't around, who knows what would have happened with, oh,
    Sozobon C (which was written in 88? 89?), or any of the other C or
    C-like compilers that were floating around for free.
