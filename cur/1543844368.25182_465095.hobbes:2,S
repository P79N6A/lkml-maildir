but it _is_ already being reaped in another thread: softirq-rcu. 
Splitting that up any further will only fragment the context-switching 
and increases cache footprint - it wont (or rather, shouldnt) have any 
functional effect. (As a sidenote, i'm considering the unification of 
all 'same default priority' softirq threads into a single thread per 
CPU, to further reduce this cost of 'spreadout'.)

ok, then i guess what we have left is to wait and see whether it still 
triggers with the current 2.6.18-rt codebase - maybe it triggers for 
someone in a scenario that is easier to debug.
