First of all, I'd like to thank Seiichi Nakashima for reporting
a few of these errors, and Jari Ruusu for reporting the problem with
the new version-name and modules. If this still doesn't work, I'll

This release is dedicated to all the innocent people of Afghanistan
that inevitably, and sadly, will suffer in the hunt for Usama Bin Ladin.
