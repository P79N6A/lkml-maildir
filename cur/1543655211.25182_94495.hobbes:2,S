That's true right now, but it may not be for other cases.  For example,
a phase-tree type of filesystem may have huge amounts of data
accumulated behind the commit, and any filesystem doing deferred block
allocation will also have a lot of data which needs to be synced
intelligently, not just by the VM walking the dirty buffer lists itself.

Absolutely, and I think an entirely separate ->sync_fs method is the way
to go, as it doesn't assume any specific semantics about what data
structure is getting locked in what fashion.
