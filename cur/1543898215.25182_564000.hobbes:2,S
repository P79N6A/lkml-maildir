Hm, I was going to measure the real power advantage with a
PCI-extender card. But my B44B0 card doesn't seem to work in
that extender card. It works perfectly fine sticked directly into
the motherboard, though, and other cards like a BCM4318 work in
the extender, too.
Not sure what this is.
The extender has an application note about nonworking cards in the
extender and a too big resistor on the board IDSEL pin being the
cause of this.
Maybe I can try with another machine tomorrow.
