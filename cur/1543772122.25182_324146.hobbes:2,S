Nope :-(

Will do. But I don't think that's it. I've been adding printks to determine the
execution path and it goes through the ERROR3 path in asb100_detect(), which means
AFACT that the error path in asb100_detect_subclients() isn't taken:
ERROR3:
        i2c_detach_client(data->lm75[0]);
        kfree(data->lm75[1]);
        kfree(data->lm75[0]);
ERROR2:
        i2c_detach_client(new_client); // <--- BUG() in here.
ERROR1:
        kfree(data);
ERROR0:
        return err;
But the ERROR2 path does work despite the location of the bug. If I apply:

No bug(). But the ERROR3 path doesn't:

causes a BUG(). I've yet to track the problem down further. Unfortunately
I have no more time today, I'll play with it again tomorrow.
