The point is to get cleaner interfaces. Anything which is kind of internal
should only be used by closely related in tree modules which can be updated. 
Point of is not to be some kind of license enforcer or similar, there 
are already other mechanisms for that. Just to get the set of really
public kernel interfaces down to a manageable level.
But I still think exporting only to a single module would be to limiting 
for this case even. It would work for the TCP<->ipv6.ko post child,
but not for some of the other networking cases where it makes sense.

That would not make the relationship explicit, which would not further
the goal.
