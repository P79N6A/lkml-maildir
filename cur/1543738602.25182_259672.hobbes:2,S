The driver in 2.6.8 contains a critical bug that prevents the operation 
on the non-GB board with a modularized driver.
See
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=128292
It's now fixed, I've written a backport of the 0.29 driver, it's at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109439014812433&w=2
But that backport was stopped due to an oddity in your original backport:
From

NVENET_3 can't have the id 0x00d5. I've asked Jane Liu a month ago to 
double check the values and I'm still waiting for a reply.
For me, that's the only open point that prevents merging. What I'm 
missing is a positive test report from a non-GB board, but that's not 
mandatory - IMHO the code receives enough testing in 2.6.
