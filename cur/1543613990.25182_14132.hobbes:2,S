Proper wrapper code can make them (almost) easy to program with.
See 
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/doc/Poller_sigio.html
 for an example
of a wrapper that automatically handles the fallback to poll() on overflow.
Using this wrapper I wrote ftp clients and servers which use a thin wrapper
api that lets the user choose from select, poll, /dev/poll, kqueue/kevent, and RT signals
at runtime.
That said, I think that using the RT signal queue is just plain the
wrong way to go, and I can't wait for better approaches to make it
into the standard kernel someday.
