A patch of PlugSched-5.0 (containing ingosched, nicksched, staircase,
spa_no_frills and zaphod CPU schedulers) against a 2.6.11 kernel is
available for download from:

PlugSched's version number has been bumped to 5.0 as further reductions
in the scheduler drive interface have been introduced.  Con Kolivas's 
"nice" aware load balancing patch has also been applied.
