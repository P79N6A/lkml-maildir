It wasn't a critical bug, in the sense that because the i82365 driver
did not work, it was not even offered as a config option.  If anything
it was merely a missing feature.  And not a critical one, since the
feature was available outside of the kernel.
It is a moot point, since i82365 works with the new patches.

Some of these have been resolved, but some remain.  They have not been
easy things to decipher since they involve interactions between the
PCI subsystem, PCMCIA, and specific hardware.
