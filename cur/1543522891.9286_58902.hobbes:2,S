Hi,
As far as I know, "read-6" is a very mandatory command. However
there is a device, the 
   {"TOSHIBA","DVD-RAM SD-W1101","*", BLIST_GHOST},
which doesn't implement it.
What do we do? 
	- Blacklist it as "doesn't support read-6" and implement
          stuff to prevent read-6 if that flag is set?
	- Ignore the issue, and just let people with this hardware
	  live with a non-working drive?
Is there maybe already something implemented? Anybody the "owner" of
that piece of code?
I seem to own the "blist_ghost" stuff, so it's going to be listed
there, but then the system runs into not-working read-6 commands.
				Roger.
P.S. (I'm not on linux-scsi, and I'm on vacation starting saturday).
I had been hoping it would've been as easy as listing the drive as
a 'blist_ghost' thing, but now things are more complicated...
