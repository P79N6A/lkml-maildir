And that's why the kernel does this:
	case MAP_SHARED:
		....
		vm_flags |= VM_SHARED | VM_MAYSHARE;
		if (!(file->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE))
			vm_flags &= ~(VM_MAYWRITE | VM_SHARED);
		...
ie it only degenerates the shared mapping to a private mapping if it 
_also_ removes the MAYWRITE bit.
So if the mapping is a shared mapping and read-only - but the file was 
opened read-write and the mapping may later be changed to a writable one - 
then Linux will keep the mapping VM_SHARED.

I'd be very very nervous about anything that documents a read-only
MAP_SHARED as anythign but a MAP_PRIVATE. That just is fundamentally not 
right, and it _will_ bite us at some point, since all of the rest of the 
VM thinks that they are the same.
