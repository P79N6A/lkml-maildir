Thanks for clarifying the situation.
Since your intellectual property is in the DSP algorithms, are there
any obstacles opensourcing the parts of the ISDN drivers which only
handle normal ISDN without fax/modem emulation? This would make every
distribution out there support your devices without any additional work
on your side.
You can still offer your full-featured drivers as usual.
