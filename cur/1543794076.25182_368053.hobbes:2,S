Ok, took a second look at this, the current code is definitely broken.
If we hit the oom killer, we goto restart with *z == NULL this time
since we already iterated through this loop once. Bad and 100%
reproducible for me, within 1 minute.

We must reassign z before looping through the zones kicking kswapd,
since it will be NULL if we hit an OOM condition and jump back to the
beginning again. 'z' is initially assigned before the restart: label. So
move the restart label up a little.
