I've seen this as well on i386.  It crops up when you are using HIGHMEM.
In include/asm-i386/pgtable.h you declare pgtable_cache_init if HIGHMEM
is on, or define it to the empty while loop if not.  It really needs to
be calling init_pae_pgd_cache instead though.  Try this patch against
2.4.9-ac4.  I don't know if changing the name of init_pae_pgd_cache was
the Right Thing (tm) to do, but it worked for me.  It's not getting
called anywhere else anyways.
