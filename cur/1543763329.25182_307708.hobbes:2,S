Aha!  There you go...  This explains why you need explicit locking rules.
When probe() and remove() are called, the driver-model core already owns
the device's lock.  If the driver then tried to lock the parent, it would
mean acquiring locks in the wrong order.  This could easily lead to
deadlock.
Furthermore, it will often happen during probe() and remove() that the
parent's lock is already owned by the USB core.  So the driver _mustn't_
try to lock it.
