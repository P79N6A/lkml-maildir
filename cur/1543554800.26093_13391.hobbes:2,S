Subject: [PATCH] CONFIG_TOSHIBA Configure.help for 2.4.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I noticed that for 2.4.0-testXX there was no help
for CONFIG_TOSHIBA, although there is for 2.2.17.
The following patch borrows the words for CONFIG_TOSHIBA
from the 2.2.17 Documentation/Configure.help. 
I checked that the URL referenced below is still valid, and it is.
And CONFIG_TOSHIBA is still used in several places in 
2.4.0-test11-pre6 code.
This patch applies against 2.4.0-test11-pre6.
