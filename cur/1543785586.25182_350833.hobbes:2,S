So? You're not making any sense.
I repeat: we CANNOT AVOID the fact that we will do COW.
That COW is required. No way we can avoid it. It has _nothing_ to do with 
maybe_mkwrite().
So I don't know why you continually refuse to just admit that fact. Why do 
you mix up the COW semantics with the maybe_mkwrite() semantics.
If you can't argue against maybe_mkwrite() without involving the COW
argument, then stop arguing. They are two totally different thigns.
