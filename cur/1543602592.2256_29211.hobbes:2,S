Mine displays a similar failure, except my strace shows:
  ioctl(3, APM_IOC_SUSPEND, 0 ) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily
unavailable)
I also noticed (as reported by a previous poster) that whether you pass
"apm=on" or "apm=off" to the kernel, apm gets disabled.  When you don't
specify a setting, it's enabled.  I had a look at the arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
in 2.4.10 though, and it seemed to make sense.
