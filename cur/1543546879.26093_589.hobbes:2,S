Not a good plan.  You really want to be able to do this on a per-file
basis, not per-device.  You want to be able to do things like open a
file O_RSYNC and know that the kernel will read from physical media
instead of from cache, or to open it O_DIRECT and know that the data
will not be cached at all.  There are so many uses for that sort of
thing that trying to fix it by adding block device or system-wide
virtual memory calls is really not going to address the needs
adequately.
