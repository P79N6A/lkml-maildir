Sorry, but that's quite ugly and will be hard to maintain (kinda like
maintaining an own assembler on your own) I think it would be far
better to require recent binutils for DEBUG_INFO builds and use the
.cfi_* mnemonics. They make dwarf2 code *much* simpler and cleaner.
Overall I think it's a good idea to add full dwarf2 annotation to
the i386 kernel, but not without assembler please.
