Check my previous email:
	[..] They will all be normal zones provided you implement a static
	view of them in the kernel virtual address space, and you also
	cover page_address/virt_to_page [..]
Depending on the kind of coalescing of those chunks in the direct
mapping virt_to_page/page_address will vary. virt_to_page and
page_address will have all the necessary internal knowledge in order to
make it all zone_normal.
