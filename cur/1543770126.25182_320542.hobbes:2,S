Hi!
I see some problems in pcmcia subsystem in 2.6.12-rc4:
On compaq nx5000, inserting CF ide card is recognized as anonymous
memory. On compaq evo, it is recognized okay and
mounts/works. Unfortunately when I unplug the card, I get an oops:

Elf kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
virtual address 00000010

. -mm kernel actually works better on nx5000; it behaves similary to
-rc4 on evo; unfortunately it produces similar oops on card unplug.
