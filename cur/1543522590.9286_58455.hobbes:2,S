I am running 2.2.13 ona a dual P-400 256M ram adaptec SCSI 3com ethernet.
When I installed this system late december (slackware 7) I had the
keyboard lockup daily the first couple of days (while running X). I
noticed a gpm error being logged and reconfigured the system not to start
it. Things have been fine until this morning when it happened again. When
the lockup happens I cannot even toggle the capslock or numlock. I can
telnet into the system and everything is still running, the mouse stil
works. If I reboot the system (shutdown -r now) everything is fine when it
comes back up.
I have not seen anything mentioned for 2.2.14 that sounded like it was
related to this, but I will upgrade to that and see. If anyone has some
other diagnostics they would like me to compile in please let me know.
