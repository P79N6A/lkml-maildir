Are you sure you reinstalled the kernel modules after rebuilding?
parport_pc_pci_remove() was 0x40 bytes long before, and still seems
to be.  Also, the Code: lines are identical.  This means you're
running the same (unpatched) code as you were before, so you aren't
actually running my fix.
Can you double-check please?
