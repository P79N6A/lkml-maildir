   While i dont think that a 2.0.39 with just this fix is a good idea (i 
agree with Alan Cox that only external vulnerabilities should be a 
reason for a new version) i believe some sort of revision of the 2.0.X 
kernels once in a while is a good idea. I myself have in production 
environment four 2.0.X machines, but i am very forward minded, so 
i can only guess how many exist in the rest of the world with 
people more conservative than me. Of course the important thing 
here is that such work could only be implemented under strict rules 
and guidance from Alan Cox, but always releasing him and others 
from the dirty work that is understandably frowned upon by them. 
So, if things go that way, i am willing to give my help to David 
Weinehall and others.
