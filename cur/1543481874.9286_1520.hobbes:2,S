I've also seen a BIOS produce 1023/255/63, presumably because 1023 is
the largest valid 9-bit unsigned number...
Those case can be dealt with by applying the following modification to
the above patch:
 >     +           drive->bios_cyl == 1024) {
becomes either
 >     +           drive->bios_cyl > 1022) {
or
 >     +           drive->bios_cyl > 1022 && drive->bios_cyl < 1030) {
Basically, does it matter if we were given valid figures, but
recalculate them anyway?
Best wishes from Riley.
