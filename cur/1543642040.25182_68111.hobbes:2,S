Hmmm...I thought a big reason for adding REQ_BARRIER was to be able to 
support more robust journaling with order requirement verification.  If 
that's true, then REQ_BARRIER commands could become quite common on disks 
using ext3.

Then you might as well skip device resets since they are implemented using 
messages and go straight to bus resets.  Shot deflected, no score.

In my experience, aborts have always actually worked fairly well in any 
scenario where a bus device reset will work.  Generally speaking, the 
problems I've always ran into with SCSI busses have been either A) this 
command is screwing up but it isn't confusing the drive so we can abort it 
or BDR it because the drive still responds to us or B) the bus is hung 
hard and no transfers or messages of any kind can make it through.  In the 
B case, a full bus reset is the only thing that works.  In the A case, 
aborts work just as often as anything else.

So does a successful abort.
