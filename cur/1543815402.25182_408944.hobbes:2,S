 Hello!
 Out of memory? Running BGP with full routing? And large number of flows. 
 Whats your normal number of entries route cache? And how much memory do 
 you have?
 From your report problems seems to related to flushing either rt_cache_flush 
 or fib_flush (before there was dev_close()?) so all associated entries should 
 freed. All the entries are freed via RCU which due to the deferred delete 
 can give a very high transient memory pressure. If we believe it's memory problem
 we can try something out...
 Cheers.
