Pretty much the same tasklist iteration issues have been visible
running benchmarks on kernels from 2.4.early up. 2.5.x activity on this
front was somewhat stymied by architecture support issues whose causes
were not discovered until 2.5.20 or thereabouts, and perhaps also the
fact little time was specifically allocated to addressing it.
