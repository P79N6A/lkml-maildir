While in theory the pid that is used for tgid should never die while the 
thread group exists, this case needs to be handled for thread groups in 
general.  The number shouldn't be re-used for a pid as long as it's in use 
as a tgid.

Are there any programs that use CLONE_VM and not CLONE_THREAD?
Actually I think we should make tgid visible in /proc in general because 
it's a useful thing to know, whether it's the right mechanism for gtop or 
not.  I'll work up a patch.
