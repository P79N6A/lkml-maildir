I don't.

Yes, we all know that, but you missed the point.  As far as this patch
goes, it's got nothing to do with the '\r'.  It's meant to get a more
informative error message from bash, if ``#!INTERPRETER'' does not
exist.  Look:
    $ cat /bin/foo.sh
    #!/foo/bar/baz
    echo bar
    $ /bin/bash -c /bin/foo.sh 
    /bin/bash: /bin/foo.sh: No such file or directory
    $ ./build/bash -c /bin/foo.sh 
    ./build/bash: /foo/bar: No such file or directory
Maybe the message could even be better, but having `/foo/bar' printed,
ie, the file that the kernel says does not exist, iso `/bin/foo.sh',
the name of the script, that certainly does exist, may help.  Possibly
both should be printed.
Greetings,
Jan.
I made a silly mistake in previous patch, sorry.
