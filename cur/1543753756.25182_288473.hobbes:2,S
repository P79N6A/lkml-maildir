Hi!
Security hook seems to be missing before compat_ioctl in mm2.
And, it would be nice to avoid calling it twice on some paths.
Chris Wright's patch addressed this in the most elegant way I think,
by adding vfs_ioctl.
Accordingly, this change:
@@ -468,6 +496,11 @@ asmlinkage long compat_sys_ioctl(unsigne
  found_handler:
 	if (t->handler) {
+		/* RED-PEN how should LSM module know it's handling 32bit? */
+		error = security_file_ioctl(filp, cmd, arg);
+		if (error)
+			goto out_fput;
+
 		lock_kernel();
 		error = t->handler(fd, cmd, arg, filp);
 		unlock_kernel();
 from Andy's "some fixes" patch wont be needed.
Chris - are you planning to update your patch to -rc1-mm2?
I'd like to see this addressed, after this I believe logically
we'll get everything right, then I have a couple of small
cosmetic patches, and I believe we'll be set.
