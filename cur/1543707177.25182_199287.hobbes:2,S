Subject: 2.6.3-rc3: USB subsystem wedged when USB keyboard is re-plugged
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I just got a USB keyboard - a pretty darn cool one, actually: an IBM
SpaceSaver with both a TrackPoint and a trackpad built-in.  And when I
plugged it in to my ThinkPad A30 yesterday, it worked great.  Then I
unplugged it and took my laptop home.
But today when I plugged in the keyboard again, the kernel broke.
Quoting dmesg:
  usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using address 5
  usb 2-2: control timeout on ep0out
And after that timeout, the USB subsystem seems totally stuck.
Nothing I do provokes any further response.  (Kind of makes me wish
I'd built the USB drivers as modules so I could unload and reload
them.)
Is this a known issue?  I'll be glad to test any patches that might help.
