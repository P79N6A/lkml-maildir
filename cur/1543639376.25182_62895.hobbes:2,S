Not much more. Around 2.3.40 I have run with a large PID_MAX for a long time.
The patch that I submitted is still visible on the net various places
(I just tried  Andries pid_max  and found a few).
At that time the only other change (other than <linux/threads.h> and
kernel/fork.c) was in proc/base.c, namely
	-#define fake_ino(pid,ino) (((pid)<<16)|(ino)) 
	+#define fake_ino(pid,ino) (((1)<<16)|(ino)) 
and
	- if (!pid) 
	-         goto out; 
	- if (pid & 0xffff0000) 
	+ if (pid <= 0 || pid >= PID_MAX) 
                  goto out; 
(plucked from google output).
I have not checked precisely what change is appropriate in procfs today.
