Michael,
Everything appears at first glance to be correct -- there is nothing glaringly
wrong with xconfig after a slightly-better-than-cursory page through it.  I
have yet to boot the kernel produced, so I can't give an honest test report
yet.  (My shiny new NHT speakers have arrived, you see, so I have to hack the
living room tonight before bundling my daughter off to bed!)
I've applied the patch to 2.2.0-pre9, as directed (since I haven't bothered
to rummage up pre9-to-release diffs yet) and did so without trouble.  There 
was a little offsetting (in Makefile) which I suspect might be due to my own
changes to my source tree, rather than patch funkiness.
If you've BYO bugs, I haven't seen them yet, but if we're unlucky enough I'll
find them later!  =)
