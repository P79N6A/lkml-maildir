Hm, but we still need to make the input_dev a "real" struct device,
right?  And if you do that, then you just hooked up your hotplug event
properly, with no userspace breakage.
Then, if you want to still make the evdev, mousedev, and so on as
class_device interfaces, that's fine, but the main point of this patch
was to allow the call_usermodehelper call to be removed, so that the
input subsytem will work properly with the kernel event and hotplug
systems.
