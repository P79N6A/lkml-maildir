    firewire: add Kconfig help on building both stacks
    Alas that won't work so good, because nobody reads help texts.
    I thought about adding some crude multiple choice selection (build the
    old stack, build the new stack, build both stacks).  It's possible, but
    it would introduce awkward dummy config variables.
