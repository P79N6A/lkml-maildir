Ok, I will prepare a patch for both cases.

With current LLVM it gives an error message in the frontend and refuses
to compile those files.
With LLVM 2.4 unsatistifiable constraints used to lead to an assertion
failure in the backend during code generation, thus also refusing to
compile the file (assertions are enabled in a release build).
However due to changes in the code generator for LLVM 2.5, mismatching
widths for same registers are no longer accepted (I think it was
complicated to support that in the code generator), and they are now
rejected in the frontend instead of the backend.
Having said that, llvm-gcc is not yet able to compile the full Linux
kernel on its own [for example the boot code, due to asm(".code16gcc")],
but with LLVM 2.4 it was
possible to build "arch=UM", and "arch=X86" (by using gcc to build the
bootcode).
I'd like LLVM 2.5 to be able to build the kernel, so I'll file bugs for
llvm/kernel depending on where the problem is.
