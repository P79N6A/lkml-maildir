you snipped out this bit where Andrew wrote:

which answers your question: i only pointed out that this is very 
similar to what i saw, spontaneous reboots. So why did you call this a 
"side swipe"? I connected up different bugreports. I do not claim that 
Andrew's reboot was necessarily due to the percpu patches, i just 
pointed out the similarity of the symptoms.
