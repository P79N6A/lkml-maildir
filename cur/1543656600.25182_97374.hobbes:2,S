Because the number pushed onto the stack is a displacement, not
an address, i.e., -4095. To have the address act as an address,
you need to load a full-pointer, i.e. SEG:OFFSET (like the old
16-bit days). The offset is 32-bits and the segment is whatever
the kernel has set up for __USER_CS (0x23). All the 'near' calls
are calls to a signed displacement, same for jumps.
It would be nice if you could just do 	call	$0xfffff000,
the problem is that the 'call' expects a displacement, usually
determined (fixed-up) by the linker. So, in this case, you
end up calling some code that exists 4095 bytes before the
call instruction NotGood(tm).
So the whole idea of this exercise is to do the same thing as
	call far ptr 0x23:0xfffff000 (Intel syntax), without
reguiring a fixup, but minimizing the instructions and disruption
due to reloading a segment.
Cheers,
