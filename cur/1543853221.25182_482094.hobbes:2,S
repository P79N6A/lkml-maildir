Ok, that's what I figured it had to be with that mask (though I can't
convince either of my compilers to produce that offset), so now we just
have to figure out how the heck it can get there and find a corrupted
pointer.
Can you enable frame-pointers, and capture another explosion?  A more
complete trace might help.  It would definitely help to reproduce
without the proprietary modules having ever been loaded.
