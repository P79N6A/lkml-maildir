Subject: PATCH: usb-uhci: interrupt out with urb->interval 0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

A recent change (2.4.21) in the usb-uhci driver calls 
"uhci_clean_iso_step2" after the completion of one-shot (urb->interval 
0) interrupt out transfers. This call clears the list of descriptors. 
However, it crashes when trying to get the next desciptor in the "for" 
loop in the "process_interrupt" function, since the list of descriptors 
are already cleared. A simple change I did was to do a "break" to quit 
the "for" loop for interrupt out transfers with urb->interval 0.
Thanks,
Frode
