How are processes, and multiple threads of a single process, balanced 
accross multiple processors?
part of the motivation is to determine what will run faster...
Dual Athlon 2400 with PC2100 memory - 760MPX Chips
	OR
Single Athlon 2400 with PC2700/3200 - KT400 Chips
There dont seem to be any boards for dual Athlon and the faster RAM.
some of the boards I am looking at are below.  Any specific comments are 
welcome.
Dual Athlon 2400MP and PC2100 - 760MPX
<MPX only supports PC2100>

     Tyan Thunder K7X (S2468)
     MSI K7D Master (MS-6501-030)
