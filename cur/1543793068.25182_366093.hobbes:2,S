+Creating non-relay files
+------------------------
+
+relay_open() automatically creates files in the relayfs filesystem to
+represent the per-cpu kernel buffers; it's often useful for
+applications to be able to create their own files alongside the relay
+files in the relayfs filesystem as well e.g. 'control' files much like
+those created in /proc or debugfs for similar purposes, used to
+communicate control information between the kernel and user sides of a
+relayfs application.  For this purpose the relayfs_create_file() and
+relayfs_remove_file() API functions exist.  For relayfs_create_file(),
+the caller passes in a set of user-defined file operations to be used
+for the file and an optional void * to a user-specified data item,
+which will be accessible via inode->u.generic_ip (see the relay-apps
+tarball for examples).  The file_operations are a required parameter
+to relayfs_create_file() and thus the semantics of these files are
+completely defined by the caller.
+
+See the relay-apps tarball at 
http://relayfs.sourceforge.net
 for
+examples of how these non-relay files are meant to be used.
