If the Dell has an IO-APIC, you want to build support for it into the
kernel -- doing so may free up some additional interrupt lines.
If you can upgrade to the 2.4.23 kernel and run in ACPI mode, then there
are a couple of knobs that might be able to help you.
        acpi_irq_balance        ACPI will balance active IRQs
        acpi_irq_nobalance      ACPI will not move active IRQs
        acpi_irq_pci=   If irq_balance, Clear listed IRQs for use by PCI
        acpi_irq_isa=   If irq_balance, Mark listed IRQs used by ISA
acpi_irq_balance is default in IOAPIC mode
acpi_irq_nobalance is default in PIC mode
the acpi_irq_[pci, isa] are to list specify IRQs that should, and should
not be used for PCI interrupts, respectively.
cheers,

ps. Might also try to disable USB in the BIOS and use a PS/2 keyboard to
free up the IRQs?
