I actually _do_ agree with you. I like Arch, but it's user interface
certainly is broken and some parts of it would sure needs some redesign.

In this case, tla init would be a lot *worse*, because there are two
different things to initialize -- the archive and the tree. But
init-archive would be a little better, for consistency.

This one is kinda broken. Even in concept it is.

*NO*. Usng this is name is STRONGLY recommended *AGAINST*. Tom once used
it in the example or in some of his archive and people started doing it,
but it's a compelete bogosity and it is not required anywhere.

I sure do. But the folks writing Bazaar are gradually fixing these.
There is a lot of them and it's not that long since they started, so
they did not fix all of them yey, but I think they eventually will.

No. The build process actually checks that the diff and patch
applications are actually the GNU Diff and GNU Patch in sufficiently
recent version. It's was not always the case, but now it does.

I don't agree with you. Using Arch is more productive (eg. because it
does merges), but certainly one could do a lot better than Arch does.
