Maybe we talked about IBM partitions before, but I forgot all
about them. Wonder why this strange convoluted code is necessary.
For example, I am worried a little by your need to call HDIO_GETGEO.
For IDE and SCSI disks, the geometry that is returned
depends on the phase of the moon and similar things.
But maybe you use it only for dasd* disks?
Is there a bug in dasd_eckd_fill_geometry()?
It seems that it sometimes fails to set geo->sectors,
but you use geo->sectors in cchh2blk() and family.
