Drats. Of course you're right. Ivan G. told me that, too. Can we agree that
this is a experimental patch (that's why I didn't cc Jeff) and that we
don't care? ;-) For my development version I broke out the whole restart
stuff into a separate inline function which comes with plenty of space to
hide away pointer arithmetics, and that's where I'm basically doing what
you suggest.  Currently I am just trying to a) find out how effective the
smallest fix I could possibly come up with is, and b) save time since I'm
kinda busy right now. Feel free to rewrite the patch to make DMA-mapping.txt
happy, though <g>.
