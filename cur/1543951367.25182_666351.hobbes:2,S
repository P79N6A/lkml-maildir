Well, I see the one comment in your Patch 2/2 noting you're unsure
of the locking in one place.
I don't see any further comments on or additional code involving
locking.
I don't see where you respond to my discussion with Peter of March
6 and 7, where I expressed some doubts about Peters patch (which you
built on in your patch 1/2 in this series).
I see only a little bit of additional comments in your patch 2/2
regarding handling of moving irqs to higher non-empty cpusets if a
cpuset is emptied of its CPUs.
I don't see any explanation of what you mean by "desired semantics."
I don't see any response to the alternatives to Peter's earlier patch
(your Patch 1/2 here) that Peter and I discussed in that discussion of
March 6 and 7.
And, in particular, could you respond to the question in my last
message:
