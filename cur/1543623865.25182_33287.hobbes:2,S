You do a merge of a particular piece of code once.
After that the SCM remembers that this merge was done
already and doesn't ask me to do it again when I move
my code base to the next official kernel version.

Yes, but doing this with the CVS storage as back-end
would just be too slow.  Also, the CVS model wouldn't
be able to easily clean out the tree afterwards if a
checkin is interrupted halfway through.

That would work, but you really need to try bitkeeper's
graphical 2-way merge tool (or even a screenshot) to see
how powerful such a simple thing can (and should) be.

I'm looking for the ability to make changes to my local tree while
away from the internet.
I want to be able to make a branch for some new VM stuff while I'm
sitting on an airplane, without needing to "register" the branch
with the SCM daemon on Linus's personal workstation.
Another thing to consider here is that you'll have dozens, if not
hundreds, of people creating branches to their tree simultaneously.
How would you ever convince rsync to merge those ?
regards,
Rik
