might_sleep() is used for debugging the possible sleep while in an
atomic operation. I think it is safe to check this for all the calls
to copy_from_user(), no matter if the access is OK or not (memset
being used in the latter case). The same is for
__copy_from_user(). Anyway, if you don't enable
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP, the might_sleep() macro is empty.
