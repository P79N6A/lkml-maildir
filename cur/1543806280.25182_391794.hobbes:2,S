What function would you have to add?  A release function?  You should
have that logic somewhere already, so net gain should be the same.

Heh, but they do catch a lot of improper usages.

It's not a different "idiom", but rather, a way to implement the
reference counting logic without having to code it all by hand, and
ensure that you get it correct.

Yes.  You are "getting" and "putting" your structure, without having to
handle the reference count.  I don't see the issue here...

They are used all the time, and there's not that many atomic_t usages in
the kernel that do reference counting that have not been already
converted to use kref (the vfs not-withstanding, for other reasons.)

They should not be "everywhere" as reference counts, except for the vm
and mm cores.

As you are adding a new reference count, it is highly encouraged that
you not reimplement the same logic, but rather use the functions already
provided in the kernel to do that work for you.  That way you don't have
to write the extra code, and we don't have to check the logic for you.
