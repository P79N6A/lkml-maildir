I've tried with UP kernel (test9 straight, no bk-wathever), preempt, and it 
freezes in the very same way. Tomorrow I'll try with UP and SMP no preempt.
the SCO module was compiled but not loaded.
I've noticed several Oopses during system shutdown, but I can't say if this is 
related to the bluetooth issue. Tomorrow I'll try again and I'll post also 
the oopses.
