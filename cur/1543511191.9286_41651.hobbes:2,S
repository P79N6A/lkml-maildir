Although XFree86 4.0 will support /dev/fb for some of the drivers, I
have seen no mention on the devel lists about moving to fbdev.  (as much
as I would like it to be true :))
Add to that the fact that DRI, potentially the standard 3D driver
interface, is very much XFree86-specific [in implemention, not concept]
and is incompatible with fbdev drivers.  Also, James Simmons' work on
fbdev (to make it more like SGI gfx devices) looks very promising, and
technically superior to DRI [when completed].
