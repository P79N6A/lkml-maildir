Waiting for your help!
After successfull update of a new kernel from 2.2.14 to 2.4.18 first rebooting did failed.  On the stage of initialisation (but before inittab) had wrote "Partition check: /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0" and buzzed.  Booting from rescue disk with differnet kernel (some disks with kernel 2.4.x does work, some doesn't) enables disk.  But I'm resctricted with usage and long booting and differnet kernel and so on.  So hard disk works through other kernel.  What can be done?
Thank you in advance,
Igor A. Dmitriev.
