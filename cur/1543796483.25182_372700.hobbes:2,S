Hi all,
I've been reading the heading comment of include/linux/init.h to learn
when and how __initdata can be used. Some of the help text doesn't seem
to match my observations, and some of it confused me and could probably
be made clearer. However, I don't feel completely comfortable with this
topic yet and would welcome comments.
First, the comment goes:
> /* These macros are used to mark some functions or 
>  * initialized data (doesn't apply to uninitialized data)
>  * as `initialization' functions. The kernel can take this
>  * as hint that the function is used only during the initialization

My tests (on i386) seem to suggest that "doesn't apply to uninitialized
data" only holds for non-global variables. Tagging uninitialized global
variables __initdata works, and moves the variables from .bss to .data.
Is it correct? Does it work on all archs? If so, the comment above
needs to be fixed.
Second, there is this sentence at the end of the help text:
>  * Don't forget to initialize data not at file scope, i.e. within a function,
>  * as gcc otherwise puts the data into the bss section and not into the init
>  * section.
It took me quite some time to figure out that this part was solely
referring to *static* local variables. Of course, on second thought it
is obvious, as non-static local variables are allocated on the stack at
runtime, and not part of the binary. But I still believe that the text
could be made clearer by explicitely referring to static local
variables.
I'm also slightly puzzled by the whole concept of __initdata static
local variables. They only seem to make sense if the function itself is
tagged __init. If so, isn't it redundant to tag the data __initdata?
Below is a proposed clarification patch.
As a side question, given that an uninitialized global variable being
tagged __initdata will be moved from .bss to .data, will it become a
truly uninitialized variable? Or will it automatically be initialized
to 0 by the compiler as .bss is?
Thanks.
