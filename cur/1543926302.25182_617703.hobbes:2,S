Side note: all of these are obviously still just heuristics. If you really 
*do* run on a 32-bit kernel, and you want to have the pain, I'm sure you 
can just disable the dirty limits with a one-liner kernel mod. And if it's 
useful enough, we can certainly expose flags like that.. Not that I expect 
that much anybody else will ever care, but it's not like it's wrong to 
expose the silly heuristics the kernel has to users that have very 
specific loads.
That said, I still do hope you aren't actually using HIGHMEM64G. I was 
really hoping that the people who had enough moolah to buy >4GB of RAM had 
long since also upgraded to a 64-bit machine ;)
