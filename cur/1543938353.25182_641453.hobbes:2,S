Yeap, true but I don't think we have many timeouts due to media errors.
 I've seen lots of SMART logs for drives which caused timeouts but
haven't seen any which logged related media errors.

My jmicron locks up hard under certain conditions.  I haven't
investigated it too deep but it looks like a hard lockup (controller
dying while holding PCI bus).  NMI watchdog doesn't work afterwards.

In that case, completing commands after 30secs doesn't really help as
long as normal operation can be recovered afterward.  The driver should
take measures against lost interrupts like polling for interrupts after
a while.  Those are two different problems and require different almost
opposite solutions.  Some controllers need registers polled once in a
while while others die when registers are read unexpectedly.
Thanks.
