We _can_ trust it in the context of
	void flush_work(struct work_struct *work)
because the caller "owns" the work_struct.  It'd be pretty nutty for the
caller to pass in a pointer to something which could be freed at any time. 
Most flush_work_queue() callers do something like:
	flush_scheduled_work();
	kfree(my_object_which_contains_a_work_struct);
hopefully libphy follows that model...

ho-hum.  I'll take a look at turning that into something which compiles,
then I'll convert a few oft-used flush_scheduled_work() callers over to use
it.  To do this on a sensible timescale perhaps means that we should export
current_is_keventd(), get the howling hordes off our backs.
