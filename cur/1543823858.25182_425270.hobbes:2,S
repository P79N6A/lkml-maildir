  I think Stephen has already explained it... We have a data buffer and
hence we use buffer_dirty()

  For two of the above comments: Under memory pressure data buffers can
be written out earlier and then released by __journal_try_to_free_buffer()
as they are not dirty any more. The above checks protect us against this.

  Yes, you are right here.

  So you basically mean switching those two branches of if.. OK, maybe.

  Yes, probably moving it to a new function may improve the readability.
Thanks for suggestions.
