Dang - I think you're right.
The original version of the patch that provided the new routine
cpuset_mem_spread_node() on about Feb 2, 2006 required that EXPORT, as
in that version cpuset_mem_spread_node() was called from the inline
versions of page_cache_alloc() and page_cache_alloc_cold().
But the final version of the cpuset_mem_spread_node() patch, on about
Feb 9, 2006, does not seem to require that EXPORT, because the callers
page_cache_alloc() and page_cache_alloc_code() were taken -out-of-line-
for the configurations that made use of cpuset_mem_spread_node().
However the EXPORT had already been added on about Feb 6 or 7, when
everyone and his brother noticed that I had broken the build with my
Feb 2 patch.
