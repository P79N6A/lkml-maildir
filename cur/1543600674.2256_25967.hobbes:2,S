Hm, I guess I had to find out, that you've the same problem than linus' tree,
only on "the other side of the street". This is a meminfo from a 2.4.9-ac9
kernel working one day, and then going crazy on too low mem. "Going crazy" here
means that kswapd took virtually over the cpu(s) and swapped the hell out the
machine:
(BTW you can see that swap did not really grow, but seems to get in and out
permanently)
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:

You are right: page cache shrunk.
You are wrong: it does _not_ work, because now buffers increased and obviously
cannot be shrunk to allow "normal" applications to run. I could not even
shutdown the machine correctly. It looks like a deadlock in vm to me.
I switched back to Linus' tree, because it does have problems, but is not dead
within one day.

Stephan
