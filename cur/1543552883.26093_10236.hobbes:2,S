Hi,
Does the Linux kernel support POSIX message queues as defined by
the Single Unix Specification, v2, ie.
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/mqueue.h.html
stuff like mq_open(), mq_send(), mq_close(), etc.
I've tried grepping the sources for 2.4.0, and could not find anything.
I noticed that RTLinux seems to support it, in a header file
called rtl_nfifo.h, in their distribution.
Are there any plans to introduce POSIX message queues in the base-line
Linux kernel?
Thanks.
