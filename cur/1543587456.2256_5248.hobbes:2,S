Not sure but I think I found a NEW bug.
I know that there have been some issues with pentiums and floating point
arrithmatic, but this takes the cake...
Linux Lserver.org 2.2.18 #43 SMP Fri Mar 9 14:19:41 EST 2001 i586
unknown
>kgcc --version
egcs-2.91.66
RH 6.2.x / 7.0
try this program
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char tmpx[100];
 char tmpy[100];
 double x = 5483.99;
 float y = 5483.99;
    sprintf (tmpx, "%f",x );
    sprintf (tmpy, "%f",y );
 printf ("%s\n%s\n", tmpx, tmpy);
 return 0;
}
I am getting the following as output
joeja@Lserver$ ./testf
5483.990000
5483.990234
what is with the .990234??  it should be .990000
any ideas on this??
