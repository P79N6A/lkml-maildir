Well, I've tried and in fact without 
old_scheme_first set ehci hands over the device to uhci, that fails to detect 
it.
And in fact uhci is loaded at boot before ehci. I've modified this, but the 
behaviour is not ok: it seems that the device is detected ok even if already 
present at boot, but then I've a keyoboard/mouse lockup

when cupds starts, that uses usb printer, the keyboard and mouse gets locked, 
simply no key press or mouse move are detected. (or, at least, it seems that 
cups driver loading causes the lockup, but I can try to repeat this).
the first log row after cups loading is this:
Dec  1 01:40:30 kefk kernel: ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:03:04.0[A] -> GSI 20 
(level, low) -> IRQ 209
But I don't think taht this can be so useful.
Please let me know is different details are needed.
This happens only when ehci is loaded before uhci and flash key is present at 
boot. 
If I keep unplugged the flash key the boot sequence goes on without problem, 
then I can plug and use flash key.
I'm unable to see on the logs where something goes wrong, but if you can tell 
me if more data are needed I can cut&paste the logs.
