It is useful on (broken) legacy serial equipment, where RTS should be 
completely under the applications control.
Glitches on RTS aren't acceptable, and confuse some devices.

That depends on the equipment that you are attached to. Some very early 
(broken) systems actually invert the meaning of RTS, so while the kernel 
thinks it is "opening" the port, it actually closes it...

I understand - the request wasn't to change the default operation - just add a 
method of controlling things, so those minority of people who want the 
control can have it.
