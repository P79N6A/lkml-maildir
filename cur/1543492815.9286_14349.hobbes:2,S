I don't think so. But, you can use any block device for swap. You can also
use a swap file. Also, you can use sevral swap devices and files. Here's
how to create a simple swap file:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=512 count=(the number of 512 byte blocks that
you want your file to have)
sync (just to make sure that the file is dumped on the disk, and is not in
      a buffer)
mkswap /swap
swapon /swap
	Though, I don't think that increasing yout total amount of swap
will affect performance if you increase ram. Let's say you have 1G of ram,
you don't need a 2G swap partition, unless there is something that I've
missed.
