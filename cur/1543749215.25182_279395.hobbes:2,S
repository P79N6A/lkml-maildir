Hi,
I am unable to find a fix for the tty/ldisc problem (CAN-2004-0814)
in 2.4.28 or 2.4 bitkeeper. I am wondering if anyone can either
point me to what I am missing or indicate if there is a reason
the patch hasn't been included. e.g. it slipped through the cracks.
The last I can find of it is here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.3/1750.html
I am just curious, I am quite happy applying Jason Baron's patch.
Thanks
