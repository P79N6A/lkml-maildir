And after quickly checking RFC 3010, I see this limitation hasn't been
lifted in NFSv4.
Speaking of which, right now ext3 doesn't know whether it's talking to
an NFSv2 or NFS v3/v4 server, so it's always passing a 32-bit cookie.
If NFSv3/v4 could use an explicit interface to request a 64-bit
cookie, instead of just relying on the f_pos field in the file handle,
we can reduce the chance of hash collisions when reading an ext3
directory significantly.   
If there are 2 or 3 directory entries that have a hash collision,
would the NFS protocol allow the server to juggle things so that those
2-3 directory entries with the hash collision are sent back in a
single readdir RPC reply?  Is it aceptable/legal to have multiple
entries in the same READDIR reply packet have the same cookie value?
