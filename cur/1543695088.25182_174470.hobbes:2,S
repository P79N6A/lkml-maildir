No, that one is correct. IRQ_INPROGRESS should indeed be cleared when the 
first handler is installed. It's only clearing it at enable_irq() that is 
wrong.
Also, the "disable_irq()" function _should_ look something like this:
	void disable_irq(unsigned int irq)
	{
	        irq_desc_t *desc = irq_desc + irq;
	        disable_irq_nosync(irq);
	        if (desc->action)
	                synchronize_irq(irq);
	}
ie it should only do synchronize_irq() if a handler exists. That fixes a
potential problem with drivers doing multiple disable_irq()/enable_irq()  
while no handler has been assigned yet.
