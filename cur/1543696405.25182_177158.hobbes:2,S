prev_cpu_load[i] is nr_running of cpu i last time this operation was
performed. Either it, or the current nr_running is taken, whichever
is lower.
I guess its done this way for cache benefits, but it was correct as
Ingo intended. For example, with Con's patch you can see
rq_src->prev_cpu_load[i] will only ever use the ith position in the array.
I wonder what improvements Con is seeing? If they are significant, change
prev_cpu_load to be an integer type and do a similar thing here.
