Heh. I wasn't aware that Alan was doing that. The EXTRAVERSION thing
"works" for exactly one patch. Patches on top of it result in rejects.
Imagine combining a Linus -preN with an Alan -acN. Therefore to keep
patches orthogonal, the only person who should modify any of the VERSION
lines in the Makefile is Linus. The patch names hack keeps each extra
version component in a separate file (along with its description) so there
are never rejects.
Arguably the EXTRAVERSION thing should be killed in favor of this
approach. Arguably the version number should be untied from the Makefile
entirely. But I don't really feel like arguing about that.
