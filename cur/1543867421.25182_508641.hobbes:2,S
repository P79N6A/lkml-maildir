Hello!
TOMOYO Linux is an access control enhancement patch
utilizing "struct task_struct".
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/
It supports 2.4.30 and later/2.6.11 and later vanilla kernels
and some of distributor's kernels.
Kickstarting page for CentOS 4.4, Fedora Core 6,
Debian Sarge, and Ubuntu 6.10 are available at
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/en/1.3.2/1st-step/
 .
You can feel what TOMOYO Linux is even if you are not
using distributions listed above.
I'm sorry for using this ml for advertisement purpose,
but I'm also searching for developers.
Please reply if you are interested in and wish to help
developing/verifying TOMOYO Linux.
Thank you.
