Subject: 2.5.xx (BK current) hangs executing rpcinfo

Hallo List,
Debian Linux checks the availibility of NFS v3 by using
# rpcinfo -u localhost nfs 3
Kernel 2.4.18 immediatly returns successful, but current
2.5 BK kernels timeout in the sendto() syscall.
Could someone please verify this ? Is this a known problem ?
Both kernels have v3 server support enabled.
It would be very kind if someone could try the above an send
a reply to me, or tell me why it's not working.
thanks,
Patrick
