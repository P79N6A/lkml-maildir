Please use "git diff -M --stat --summary" to generate the diffstat: the -M 
enables rename detection, and the summary enables a summary of new/deleted 
or renamed files.
With rename detection, the statistics are rather different:
 419 files changed, 13022 insertions(+), 18878 deletions(-)
because git will notice that a fair number of the changes are renames.
