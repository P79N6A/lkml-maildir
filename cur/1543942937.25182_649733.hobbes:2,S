I am giving my opinion.  By contrast, you have claimed to be giving the
opinion of numerous lawyers.  I hate to be so blunt, but that is the
naked truth.  You could improve that situation.

No argument, other than with, "export symbol is a guide."   My argument
with that is that one could mistakenly infer that "export symbol"
includes "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL."   The latter is not a guide, is it?  It
restricts a symbol from use by proprietary modules.
