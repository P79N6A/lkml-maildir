I did look at the patch and can gladly add a:
Reviewed-by: Pekka Enberg <penberg@cs.helsinki.fi>
But this seems backwards. It was _your_ commit that broke the setup and 
the patch touches a driver _you're_ maintaining.
So can we just revert commit 753f492093da7a40141bfe083073400f518f4c68 
("[B44]: port to native ssb support") from 2.6.24 and you can add it back 
to 2.6.25 if the problem indeed does go away?
