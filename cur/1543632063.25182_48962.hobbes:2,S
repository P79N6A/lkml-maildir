Broken software can be fixed.
There are few excuses for uninterruptible sleep.
Most of them are 'I was too lazy to write the cleanup path.'
The one you offer seems to be 'Other people are too lazy to write 
the cleanup paths which POSIX mandates.' -- which isn't a great deal 
more acceptable than the original excuse, IMHO.
What I'd _really_ like at the moment is an option to allow read_inode() to
be interruptible. Currently there's no way for it to exit without leaving a
bad inode behind, which prevents the _next_ iget() for that inode from
actually succeeding.
