jbglaw@mirror:~$ rsync kernel.bkbits.net::
rsync: failed to connect to kernel.bkbits.net: Connection refused
rsync error: error in socket IO (code 10) at clientserver.c(83)

Allowing rsync on the repository could help people on slow links (modem)
esp. as CVS isn't exactly known to be fast and evvective. I'd love to
have it rsyncable (as we have it for mips-linux:-)
