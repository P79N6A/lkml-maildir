Sorry, that is bullshit. The change was entirely designed to prevent
people on such architectures hacking general files where there *do*
exist older compilers, to avoid breakage being introduced without it
being flagged.
This has happened more than once in the tree.
When all the architectures have a minimum gcc requirement that accepts
mixed code and declarations by default, it can be removed ...
