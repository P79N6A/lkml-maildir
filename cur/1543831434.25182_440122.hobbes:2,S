This one is now fixed in the git tree:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/steve/gfs2-2.6.git
Also fixed/changed in this tree is:
 o Mark GFS2 file_operations const
 o Mark GFS2 address_space_operations const
 o Update gfs2_statfs() API in line with change in Linus' tree
 o Update gfs2_get_sb() API in line with change in Linus' tree (thanks
to Andrew Morton for this one)
 o Updated to latest Linus tree
So I think that brings the code back uptodate after my holiday last
week.

I believe that this point is now resolved (so far as GFS2 going upstream
is concerned) from the discussions that have gone on in my absence. Its
obviously still an ongoing concern for a number of filesystems, not just
GFS2 and I'll be working on ways to reduce the current "nofail"
allocation calls in the future,
Steve.
