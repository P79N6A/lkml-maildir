Ok so why are you doing this via pipes ? Whatever happened to passing
file handles. You set the tcp to block sending partial frames, you
write the header pieces you can you fire the cgi up with the socket fd.
Better yet since in the real world you dont use an exec every time cgi
model (if you do then io-lite is the least of your worries) you pass the
file handle with fd passing.
We have a mechanism for passing the data channel itself. Checksum caching
is a seperate issue to this.
