readv/writev were done ages ago (since they are necessary for other
reasons).  pread/pwrite I can look at later - but I don't think they would
be used to read/write events from evedv and we do *NOT* want to encourage
people to use read/write on structures (especially ones that need compat_
munging.
I know this is horrible but evdev needs fixing somehow - and I argued for
the other alternative.
And where were you a week ago when I asked if I should post this patch? 
And why didn't you guys corner Andi at OLS? :-)
