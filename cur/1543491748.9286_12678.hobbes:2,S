Hi Alan! :-)

  I have take a look to my log files (including the chat log) previously:
  Apr  2 14:27:57 solfire pppd[1081]: pppd 2.3.7 started by root, uid 0
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: timeout set to 360 seconds
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (NO CARRIER)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (BUSY)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (NO DIALTONE)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (ERROR)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (CONNECT 2400)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (CONNECT 4800)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: abort on (CONNECT 9600)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: send (+++ATZ0^M)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: expect (OK)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: +++ATZ0^M^M
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: OK
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]:  -- got it 
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: send (+++ATDTxxxxxxxxxxx^M)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: expect (CONNECT)
  Apr  2 14:27:59 solfire chat[1084]: ^M
  (at this point I have to kill chat by hand....the modem hangs again)
  Apr  2 14:28:20 solfire pppd[1081]: Connect script failed
  Apr  2 14:28:21 solfire pppd[1081]: Exit.
  Apr  2 14:28:38 solfire init: Switching to runlevel: 6
    
  After the dial command the modem swallows the command but does not dial.
  All (personal) settings are stored in the EEPROM of the modem in profile 0.
  Sometime it even hangs after 'ATZ0' (returning no 'OK').
  Do you know a "forbidden" setting directly, Alan? I dont want to eat up your
  time with mailing you the setting of all the S-registers of my modem........
  If it wouldn't dial EACH time, I would say: Ok, the settings are wrong.
  But it often hangs right after power on. A second attempt succeds many times.
  Sometimes it falls asleep inbetween of waiting for another surf tour ;-)
  KEEP HACKING!
