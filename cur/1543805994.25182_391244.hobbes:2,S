It may not be impossible, but adding support for dsa key types to the 
in-kernel key management is something like 150 lines of code once the 
dsa crypto-ops are implemented. I think you get a lot of convenience 
for those 150 lines (and yes, I do believe that convenience is also a 
valid argument for adding functionality). Having to protect against all 
attack vectors is much harder in user-space than in kernel-space.
As for the addition of the dsa crypto-ops, you still haven't answered 
the question of how signed modules and/or binaries can be implemented
in userspace...
