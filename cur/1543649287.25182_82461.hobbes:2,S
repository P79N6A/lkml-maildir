Right, it's swapping out the controlling structures without swapping
out the pages themselves that's harder.

I think it will for most of the situations we run aground with now
(normally 5000 oracle tasks sharing a 2Gb shared segment, or some
such monster).

It's more complicated than that ... I'll let Rik or one of the K42
guys who understand it better than I do explain it (yeah, I'm wimping
out on you ;-))
