Replying to myself, this hang started when do_mmap_pgoff() was
changed to re-read the vma->vm_flags bits right before we
vma_link() the vma into the mm.
Previously, only the mmap() call specified vm_flags would
be used, but now we also get whatever bit changes to
vma->vm_flags are done by the file->f_op->mmap() method
as well.
In any event, it is still an open question whether get_user_pages()
and thus make_pages_present() is meant to be able to handle
VM_IO areas.
