Correct me, IANAL, but my understanding is that klibc will be dual 
GPL/<whatever it is now> by inclusion into the kernel tree, after all the 
whole purpose is to provide an initramfs which will be linked into vmlinux 
(Yes, linked not in the normal sense, but still). 
So it'd rather be similar to some parts of the kernel which are already
dual licensed (parts of ACPI I think being the latest example), and
patches will be assumed to be contributed under that dual license, unless
explicitly stated otherwise.
Or not?
