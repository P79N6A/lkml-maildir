Hi.
I should mention, I'm planning on producing a BK tree with these patches
(and ones to fix issues raised), so you won't have to include a long
list in -mm eventually! It will be on suspend2.bkbits.net (not there
yet).
Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
