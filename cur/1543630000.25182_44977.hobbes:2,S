Subject: [BK PATCH] PCI reorg fix

Linus,
James pointed out that pci_alloc_consistent() and pci_free_consistent()
are allowed to be called, even if CONFIG_PCI is not enabled.  So this
changeset moves these calls back into the arch/i386/kernel directory.
Pull from:  bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-pci
As a side note, I don't think that any pci_* function should be able to
be called by non-pci drivers.  Is it worth spending the time now in 2.5
to make these two functions not rely on 'struct pci_dev' and fix up all
of the drivers and architectures and documentation to reflect this?
Possible names would be alloc_consistent() and free_consistent()?
thanks,
greg k-h
