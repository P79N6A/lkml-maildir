this isnt really a problem. The current situation is simply hacky, 
because right now there's no 'threaded' flow type at all. The x86 code 
just moves the code away from fasteoi:
 #ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_HARDIRQS
                set_irq_chip_and_handler_name(irq, &ioapic_chip,
                                            handle_level_irq, "level-threaded");#else
                set_irq_chip_and_handler_name(irq, &ioapic_chip,
                                              handle_fasteoi_irq, "fasteoi");
 #endif
what should happen is a handle_thread_irq irq-flow handler that will 
first mask, and then ack or eoi (whichever callbacks is available), and 
thus can and will handle both fasteoi, edge and level irqs.
