Subject: PROBLEM: 2.2.5 smp kernel locks up when transferring large files  over LAN

I'm consistently running into a bug with the 2.2.5 smp kernel where the
system locks up when transferring large files (~10 Megs or larger) via ftp
on a local lan. I can boot my system with a 2.1.125 smp kernel and can't
reproduce the bug at all. Also, I've used a couple different ftp client
programs (regular ftp, and lftp) and still get the same results. There is a
strange quirckiness in the hardware setup needed to reproduce the bug that
I'll detail below.
When the system locks up, after a few minutes of waiting the following
appears on the main system terminal (the system is still locked up though
after this):
irq:   2 [0 2]
bh:   1 [1 0]
<[c010a8e9]> <[c010a82a]> <[c010aafb]> <[c0154e19]> <[c0150275]>
<[c015da85]> <[c015dd9a]>
Here's the hardware setup:
1. Dual P-Pro 180's (256k cache), with 128 Megs EDO memory.
2. Super Micro motherboard, model P6DNF.
3. Adaptec 2940UW pci card, with a  4gig scsi UW harddrive, scsi cdrom.
4. 3com 3c509b ISA PnP ethernet card (though the PnP has been disabled).
5. Soundblaster Awe32 (isa)
6. Matrox Millinium II video card.
Hardware Quirckiness:
The local LAN consists of the the server machine and a laptop connected to
the same T-base 10 router (it's a generic cheap-ass 8-port router). The
cable length between the two is large - the server's cable is 50 feet, the
laptop is 40 feet.
What is strange, and why I'm mentioning the cable length, is that when I had
a third machine running on the lan (it was running windows 98), the bug
would not show up. The cable length to this third machine is 10 feet. Don't
know if cable length could be an issue.
All machines have static IPs (they're using the 192.168.1.x allocations).
If no one is able to repro the bug, and it's not to hard to explain how to
debug the kernel, let me know and I'll try my hand at debugging (though up
till now I've always dealt with userland development stuff).
Also, I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu, so if you could
cc or reply me at brimhall@pobox.com I'd appreciate it.
Here's more info (using REPORTING-BUGS template). It is gleamed *after*
rebooting the locked system.
