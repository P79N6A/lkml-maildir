Ok. I'll try that..
AFAIK, Amiga doesn't support 64 bit filesystems, I'll
dig out some old CBM documents later to check..

Again, afaik the standard Amiga filesystems were.
If this is wrong, someone please tell me..
(though, if it is wrong I'll probably encounter it myself when
 I try to mount some affs partition images I have.)
So asides from the page cache & 64bit issues, are there any
other issues with AFFS that need fixing ?

in include/linux/fs.h there's a reference to abs.
Would there be any problem with replacing this with an inlined
abs function? (There's also some other bits that would need fixing
to stop redefinition of abs). If so, I've a patch in progress..
regards,
Dave.
