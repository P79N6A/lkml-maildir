I'm using glibc-2.1 from <
ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/glibc/>

egcs-1.1.1 and 1.1.2-pre2 work fine. Latest snapshots (up to 19990228, I'm
building 19990307 right now) build kernels that don't do networking ("ping
localhost" either gets one response once or none at all, "ifconfig" shows
the packets going through). Both 2.2.2-acX, X <= 7 and 2.2.3-preY, Y <= 2,
are affected.
Don't try egcs on 2.0 series, it'll break.
