Hmm, good question. I do not have any other PCMCIA device to test.
The only other device I have is a Cardbus Wi-Fi adapter without Linux 
support (Marvell). If I insert that adapter lspci seems to list it 
properly, but without resorting to ndiswrapper I have no way of testing 
it. In any case, seeing how Cardbus is PCI based this is probably 
pointless to resolving this issue.
Would any other log data from the controller initialization or lspci help?
