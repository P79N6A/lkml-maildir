Hi,
I'm having problems with a Abit BH6 motherboard in conjunction
with a S3 Trio64V+ video card.
When using the X server in 16-bit mode the computer completely freezes
in no time. In 8-bit mode I have to try a bit harder.
I also discovered that I can't do (the computer freezes):
cat /proc/bus/pci/00/07.3
When using the computer with a ISA videocard (the only one that I got my hands
on) I see no problems.
I also have problems with W95.
The output of lspci -vvx is:
