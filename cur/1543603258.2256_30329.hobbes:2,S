Look at fs/binfmt_elf.c, at line 642 (in -ac2). There is
error = elf_map(....)
but nobody bothers with checking error value, it even tries it
to use as an offset if stars are in wrong constellation.
If you could add these lines below the call:
if ((unsigned long)error >= (unsigned long)(-256)) {
  set_fs(old_fs);
  printk(KERN_DEBUG "Something went wrong with elf_map()\n");
  kfree(elf_phdata);
  send_sig(SIGSEGV, current, 0);
  return 0;
}
and then report results...
