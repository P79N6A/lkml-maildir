A file has these properties:
1. it can not be the current working directory of a process
2. it can be atomically unlinked
3. it has a single ACL (or UNIX permission bits, or whatever)
4. it can be hard-linked if the filesystem supports hard links
5. it has exactly one inode number
6. it has a visible name (ignoring hard links and deleted files)
7. it is of type S_IFREG (but note: directories may have streams too)
8. it has at least one stream, just as a process has threads
A stream has these properties:
1. it is a blob of data w/o OS-interpreted structure
2. it shared (inheritance WITH UPDATE) properties with others
3. it can not be independently hard linked
4. it has no normally visible name
5. st_mode has no meaning, except to describe the parent type
6. streams themselves do not have streams

One may implement complex document files using multi-streamed
files or, less efficiently, using single-streamed files. Using
multi-streamed files is a performance hack that may require some
sort of format-specific loadable module. Microsoft actually does
have such kernel support for the *.doc format. The concept isn't
at all alien to Linux; look at all the IP masquerading helpers.
(the kernel module exists only to solve the "lost stream" problem)
