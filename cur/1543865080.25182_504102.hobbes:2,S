I started working on one a while ago but I ran out of time to  
dedicate to the project.  My schedule is opening up again, though, so  
I plan to start working on it again.  At this point I have most of  
the actual loader code written, the problem is that the syscalls  
between Linux and Darwin are very different and need a binary  
translation layer which is still in the concept phase at this point. :-D
