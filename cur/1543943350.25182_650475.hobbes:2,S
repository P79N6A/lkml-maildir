Subject: [PATCH 05/11] SUNRPC: Update help Kconfig text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/291

Clean up: refresh the help text for Kconfig items related to the sunrpc
module.  Remove obsolete URLs, and make the language consistent among
the options.
