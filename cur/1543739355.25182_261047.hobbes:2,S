This seems to be a case of not being able to please everyone.
James Bottomley asked for documentation on the usage of mmiowb().
Guennadi asked for one copy of the documentation and the references
to that in other places.
I don't really care that much, but this is the third version of this
patch, where the only difference is comments.  If it's all right, let
this go in, and you can submit patches to change the comments later.
I believe James' idea was that qla1280 would be the "example" driver.
