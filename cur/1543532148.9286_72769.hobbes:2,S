your net tools are old and need updated.
there is only one physical device, it is either up or down.  the proper way
to think of the device is this:
# ip a s eth1
6: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
    link/ether 00:a0:cc:54:e1:eb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 208.179.68.66/26 brd 208.179.68.127 scope global eth1
    inet 208.179.68.67/26 brd 208.179.68.127 scope global secondary eth1
...
there is one physical device that can be up or down and one or more
addresses associated with it.
