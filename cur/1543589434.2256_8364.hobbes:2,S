I should probably clarify.  The fix is *only* valid for the VIA VT8363 host to
pci bridge, therefore the test for the 686B south bridge only gets done if a
8363 is found.  
No fix is known for intel pci-to-host bridges with the 686B south bridge,
and in the case of the AMD-761 chipset, there are certain BIOS settings you
can change.  See:
