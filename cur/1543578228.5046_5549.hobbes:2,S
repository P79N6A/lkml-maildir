You're not the only one that is suprised :
1) Put disk in my machine (target machine hangs itself with the disk)
2) use setmax to set the limit to 32 GB
3) Put the disk in the target machine
4) System boots, linux sees 64GB
5) rebooted system, system hangs due to the soft clippig 'vanished'
I even had occurences of the kernel setmax message showing up, and after a
plain reboot it didn't.
It beats me.. I can't explain, and the machine is rock solid now.
