So this works for me--and I guess I may as well submit it in a pull
request.  But: it sounds like we still have a regression for ecryptfs?
(Since on ecryptfs export nfsd will still try to get the mutex twice on
create, unlink, etc.)  Maybe we should just revert
4c728ef583b3d82266584da5cb068294c09df31e entirely for now?

    nfsd: fix double-locks of directory mutex
    A number of nfsd operations depend on the i_mutex to cover more code
    than just the fsync, so the approach of 4c728ef583b3d8 "add a vfs_fsync
    helper" doesn't work for nfsd.  Revert the parts of those patches that
    touch nfsd.
    Note: we can't, however, remove the logic from vfs_fsync that was needed
    only for the special case of nfsd, because a vfs_fsync(NULL,...) call
    can still result indirectly from a stackable filesystem that was called
    by nfsd.
