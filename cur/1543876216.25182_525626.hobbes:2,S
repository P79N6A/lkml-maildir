I've tested this patch little bit more on my nx6325 and I've found scenario in
which my box works slow. When I boot HP with connected AC (it boots fast), and
then after boot I unplug AC and try to power HP off it's working very slow
(powering off process take few minutes). On battery it's always booting and
powering off fast. Can enybody with nx6325 confirm this ?
