Your brain is HEAVILY FATALLY UNRECOVERABLY flawed, not design of mke2fs :-))

At least this way true last time (year ago) when I'm last bought floppies here...

Yes, really ?

Are you sure ? What about 5" 720K disks ? A have few 5" 1440Kb disks and 720Kb
disks :-))

Since in DOS low-level format and filesystem creation is combined in one
program unlike Linux.

I'm just checked with RedHat 5.1 :-))

Why mke2fs works just fine after fdformat /dev/fd1h360 but not after
fdformat /dev/fd1h1200 ?
