I've been modifying the kernel to do inter-file prefetching (part of
my thesis research) and have gotten similar warnings on modified
versions of 2.2.5 and 2.2.7.  In fact I'm currently trying to debug
what's causing these warnings to occur.
Nevertheless, I have not gotten them in an unmodified kernel.
