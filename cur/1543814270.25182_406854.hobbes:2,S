Why do people equate embedded with small amounts of memory.  I know  
of embedded systems which use 32-bit PowerPCs that have >4G of system  
memory.

I dont follow.  I would say that most drivers shouldn't care about  
the fact that they are on a 32-bit platform or 64-bit platform.  The  
point is that drivers have made assumptions about being on 32-bit  
platforms which breaks when a 32-bit platform supports a larger  
physical address space.
