I tried 2.6.9 with 4GB and it didn't make any difference.
However, I removed 2 GB from the box as Alan sugggested and now the box
comes up just fine with a 64-bit 2.6.11.6 kernel! I've put the 4GB back,
and booted with the kernel "mem=2048" command line option - that also
works, the i2o_block driver sees the adaptec controller just fine.
And I just booted it with "mem=3840M" and that works too.
So the problem appears to be 4 GB memory in 64 bit mode, on this box.
Mike.
