Sorry folks, I do understand the issue now with midnight commander. It's when selecting an archive and hitting enter, to view the contents rather than extracting or just viewing a list of contents with the view command. It executes instead when it's +x. That was rather thick skulled of me and of course I can see the same behaviour in my mc when files are executable.
Shutting up now, and I'll think more carefully before posting in future,
Grogan
