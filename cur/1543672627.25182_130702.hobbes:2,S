Again, this is nonsense and misinformation.  Look at do_fork() and
alloc_task_struct().  Do you see how alloc_task_struct() is just
defined to be __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,1) for i386?  Do you
understand that that just allocates two pages (8K) of kernel memory?
Do you see that it is never mapped into userspace, and that anyway
a userspace process can use far more than 8K of stack?
That 8K of memory is used for the kernel stack for a particular
process.  When a process makes a system call, that specific stack is
used as the kernel stack.

Right.  Now think about where the kernel stack for the process that is
sleeping in the kernel is kept.
