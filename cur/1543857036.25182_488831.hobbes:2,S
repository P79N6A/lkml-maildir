Hi,
ENOTSUP is not used at all by linux (though it is defined for parisc),
while as susv3 specifies, ENOTSUP shall be different than EOPNOTSUPP.
Is there a reason for doing so? (except history)
Currently, code like
switch(errno) {
	ENOTSUP:
		foo();
		break;
	EOPNOTSUP:
		bar();
		break;
}
just can't compile...
Is there any way to fix this?  Glibc people don't seem to want to fix it
on their part, see
