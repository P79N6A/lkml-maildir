strange, the algorithm should be nearly the same now (modulo RT). Still
I wonder that's something else on the short lived gcc processes side.

the right implementation would be probably to let all the other task
run, so it can't waste entire timeslices if two tasks runs sched_yield
in a loop and the holder waits behind them, but that proven to be quite
slow in pratice for apps like openoffice (really when we tested that
algorithm there were still various bugs but I still think letting all
tasks to run before staroffice could make progress was the major reason
of the slowdown, think all gcc spending their timeslice before you can
take a mutex etc...).
