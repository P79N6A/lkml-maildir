It is fine, for epoll itself, even if sizeof(void *) > sizeof(__uint64_t).
Conversion functions for legacy 32-bit code running on a 128-bit chip
will be more complex, but epoll is the _least_ of problems in that case...

The AIO subsystem has a very similar cookie, which is simply declared
as `__u64 aio_data' in user-supplied requests, and returned in the
responses.  It's converted to a field called `ki_user_data' in the
kernel.
Just a few reference points...  I like `user_data' myself.

That is a good idea, if we go for the union.
