IIRC, Zach's patches for gdt alignment, moved the gdts from per_cpu data
structure to each secondary CPU dynamically allocating page for its gdt.
This was mainly to address the excessive cost in virtualized
environments of sharing the gdt page with other RW items in per_cpu_data
structure.  I think the padding was because xen does not like sharing
gdt page with anything else...
I agree that if no other constraint is there then IDT could be moved
into the same page.
