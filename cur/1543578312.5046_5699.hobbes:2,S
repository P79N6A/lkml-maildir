Is it possible to avoid the SMP cross-call in the case that the other
threads have neither accessed nor dirtied the page in question?
One way to implement this is to share VMs but not the page tables, or to
share parts of the page tables that don't contain writable pages.
Just a sudden inspired thought...  I don't know if it is possible or
worthwhile.
