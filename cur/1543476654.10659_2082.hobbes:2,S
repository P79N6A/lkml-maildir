someone correct me if I am misunderstang this, but I am understanding the
origional idea to mean that when a program does a system call that would
automatically end it's time slice, as opposed to the behavior that Alan is
mentioning where you can make as many system calls as you want and your
time slice ends as close to the normal time as possible.
Question, does a blocking system call do this already? if so what other
system calls are people thinking it would be worthwhile to do this to?

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
