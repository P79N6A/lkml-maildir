In general generic hardware bits for disabling DMA, disabling interrupts
and the like are all advisory.  With the current architecture things
will work properly even if you don't manage to disable DMA (assuming
you don't reassign IOMMU entries at least).
Non-shared interrupts are not a problem as they can fairly safely
be disabled at the interrupt controller.
Shared interrupts are an interesting case.  The simplest solution I can
think of for a crash dump capture kernel is to periodically poll
the hardware, as if all interrupts are shared.  At that level
I think we could get away with ignoring all hardware interrupt sources.
Does anyone know of a anything that would break by always polling
the hardware?  I guess there could be a problem with drivers
that don't understand shared interrupts, are there enough of those
to be an issue.
