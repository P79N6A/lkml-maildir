it's inherited for PT_GNU_STACK though.
Not sure how you implemented PT_PAX_FLAGS, but for PT_GNU_STACK it's
inherited.

sure they do. There's about a handful in an entire distro.

I'm not a fan of any kind of emutrampoline. At all. But I am open to
others making a different tradeoff; for me the option to have a
trampoline at all is just a bypass of the non-exec stack... legit bypass
one hopes but a bypass regardless. Some time ago we did an eval of how
much stuff would need the emutramp (well or something equivalent) and
the list was so small that I decided that the added risk and complexity
were not worth it and that I rather had those 5 or so apps run with exec
stack.

well that is an entirely independent thing again. Really.
I think mixing all these into one big flag is a mistake. 
(And thats a lesson I learned the hard way, but Linus was right; don't
mix independent things into one flag artificially. Extra flags are
cheap. Don't complicate the world for a dozen bytes.)
