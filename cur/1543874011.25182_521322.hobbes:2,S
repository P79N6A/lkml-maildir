The sigset is passed to the device node just for safekeeping, as it 
doesn't normally change.  It's only used when switching to guest mode.

Right.  I agree it's more natural to associate a vcpu with a task 
instead of a vcpu being an independent entry.  We'd still need a handle 
for it, and in Linux that's an fd (pid doesn't cut it as it's racy, and 
probably slower too as it has to go through a global structure).

I guess once we have smp, and preferably an additional arch port, we can 
do another round of API consolidation around a syscall based API.  We'll 
need to support the ioctl based API in parallel until the distros flush 
out older userspace.
