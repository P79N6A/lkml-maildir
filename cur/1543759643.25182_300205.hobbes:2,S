Unfortunately:
1) This requires third-party software to work
2) This also disables the up/down scrolling cruise control buttons. The
buttons above and below the scroll wheel are supposed to not only be
remapped to buttons 4 and 5, but also have a auto-repeat added when held
down. (The same auto-repeat is also required by the horizontal
scrollers, unless it's to be dictated that user-space software needs to
apply their own repeat mechanism)
