this must not be a class device, but at the moment TTY, network and
input are still class devices. The Bluetooth subsystem moved away from
using class devices.

This won't work for Bluetooth. We create the TTY and its class device
with tty_register_device() and then the device node is present. Then at
some point later we open that device and the Bluetooth connection gets
established. Only when the connection has been established we know the
device that represents it. So tearing down the class device and creating
a new one will screw up the application that is using this device node.
Would reissuing the uevent of the class device help here?
Regards
Marcel
