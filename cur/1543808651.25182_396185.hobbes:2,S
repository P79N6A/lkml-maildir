Well, I've just tried 2.6.16-rc2-ide2 on another VIA-based machine  
and it seems to work just fine, allowing me to say CONFIG_IDE=n :-)  
The CD drives work just fine including writing CDs, so I'm going to  
try writing a DVD soon, which should stress it a little more.  
However, I keep getting the following messages in dmesg:
[4294985.285000] Assertion failed! qc->n_elem > 0,drivers/scsi/libata- 
core.c,ata_fill_sg,line=2635
[4294985.377000] Assertion failed! qc->n_elem > 0,drivers/scsi/libata- 
core.c,ata_fill_sg,line=2635
This seems mostly harmless as everything seems to just work, but  
curious nonetheless.
HTH,
Chris
