We've had users report lockups, random oopses and other problems
with lvcool and amd76x_pm in the past, that went away when the
module.  The lack of understanding of this problem makes me inclined
to say that this shouldn't get merged upstream until it's solved.
If it does get merged, it's not something I intend to enable
in a distro kernel for some time, if at all.
