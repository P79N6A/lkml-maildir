it does exactly what you wrote with some minor steps such as networking 
stop on source and start on destination etc.
So I would detailed it like this:
- freeze VPS
- freeze networking
- copy VPS data to destination
- dump VPS
- copy dump to the destination
- restore VPS
- unfreeze VPS
- kill original VPS on source
Moreover, in OpenVZ live migration allows to migrate 32bit VPSs between 
i686 and x86-64 Linux machines.
Thanks,
Kirill
