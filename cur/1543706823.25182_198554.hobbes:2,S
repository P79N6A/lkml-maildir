okay, here is the promised update, a little later
as planned, because I discovered that doing 'make dep'
would be a great idea too (well that isn't necessary
for 2.6.x so it doesn't change those results), but
still some archs give troubles ...
  linux-2.4.25-rc2        config  dep     kernel  modules

but hey, it's better than before ...
you can get all the details, what and why? it fails
from the logs:

any help or hints are appreciated, as it would be great
to get this running ...
TIA,
