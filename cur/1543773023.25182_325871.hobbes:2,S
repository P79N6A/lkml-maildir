Now, if somebody compiles this with NDEBUG? It is bad practice to put
code with side-effects into assertions.

FIBMAP is obsolete API, I believe. For certain file systems it doesn't
make sense to ask "in what block, i-th logical block of given file
lives?" for directory files, because directories do not have linear
structure, e.g., are implemented as B-trees. Not incidentally these are
the same file systems that have trouble supporting optional
seekdir/telldir API.
Moreover, for some file systems this question doesn't make a lot of
sense even for regular files, e.g., because small files can be stored in
the same block, or some blocks might be in the "unallocated state", or
file system does behind-the-back relocation to improve disk layout, etc.
Nor does it make sense to ask such questions when files are stripped
over multiple devices, or served over network, or backed up by memory...
Basically, FIBMAP is a hack.
