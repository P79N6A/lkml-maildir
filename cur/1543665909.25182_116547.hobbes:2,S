Hi,
Assuming I have got a particular (struct dentry*)dp, how can I get it's full 
path name.
I understand that dp->d_name.name contain the relative path name. Then I can 
cycle through dp->d_parent while( !IS_ROOT(dp) ).
But that cycle finishes when the mount point of the current file system is 
hit.
How can I get the mount point's struct dentry of the parent file system basing 
on the root dentry of mounted file system?
Thanks
Torsten
