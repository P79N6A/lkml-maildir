    Not easily. If you know roughly where things line up you can hunt for the
    unix superblocks and FAT tables.
    If you set one partition for the whole disk, that should let you back up the
    first partition you had at least. It may also let you know a size so you can
    hunt the next one
There are various rescue type programs around that try to
guess a partition table given a disk.
FAT partitions and partition table sectors can be recognized by the aa55
signature. Ext2 superblocks can be recognized by the ef53 signature.
A single scan over all disk sectors will give you all partition starts
(and possibly a few false alarms). Now a vague memory of the partition sizes
or inspection of the filesystem data quickly leads to a repaired
partition table.
