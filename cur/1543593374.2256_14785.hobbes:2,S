Can someone elaborate on why it's bad to refer to tsk directly below (this
is a 2.4.5 change in x86) and why it's needed on x86 and not other archs..
What should I do for an arch that does not have a "cr3" machine register
to check with ?

        {
                /*
                 * Synchronize this task's top level page-table
                 * with the 'reference' page table.
                 *
                 * Do _not_ use "tsk" here. We might be inside
                 * an interrupt in the middle of a task switch..
                 */
                int offset = __pgd_offset(address);
                pgd_t *pgd, *pgd_k;

                pte_t *pte_k;
                asm("movl %%cr3,%0":"=r" (pgd));
                pgd = offset + (pgd_t *)__va(pgd);
