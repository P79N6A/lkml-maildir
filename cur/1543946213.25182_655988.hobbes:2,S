What is your evidence for saying this? Because here, with the latest
kernel and recent gcc-4.3 snapshot, it spits out cmov like crazy even
when compiled with -O2.
npiggin@am:~/usr/src/linux-2.6$ grep cmov kernel/sched.s | wc -l
45
And yes it even does for hinted branches and even at -O2/3
npiggin@am:~/tests$ cat cmov.c
int test(int a, int b)
{
        if (__builtin_expect(a < b, 0))
                return a;
        else
                return b;
}
npiggin@am:~/tests$ gcc-4.3 -S -O2 cmov.c
npiggin@am:~/tests$ head -13 cmov.s
        .file   "cmov.c"
        .text
        .p2align 4,,15
..globl test
        .type   test, @function
test:
..LFB2:
        cmpl    %edi, %esi
        cmovle  %esi, %edi
        movl    %edi, %eax
        ret
..LFE2:
        .size   test, .-test
This definitely should be a branch, IMO.

It shouldn't be hard to work out the cutover point based on how
expensive cmov is, how expensive branch and branch mispredicts are,
and how often the branch is likely to be mispredicted. For an
unpredictable branch, cmov is normally quite a good win even on
modern CPUs. But gcc overuses it I think.
