do these occur under PREEMPT_RT? If yes, do you get any useful trace if 
you enable all the tracing options but keep wakeup-timing off:
 # CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING is not set
 CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACE=y
 CONFIG_CRITICAL_PREEMPT_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_CRITICAL_IRQSOFF_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_CRITICAL_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_LATENCY_TIMING=y
 CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE=y
 CONFIG_MCOUNT=y
this should catch any type of preempt-off section, irqs-off and 
preempt_disable() alike. (unless the tracer has a bug.)
(WAKEUP_TIMING is useful and lightweight but if all other tracing 
features are enabled it's a bit pointless, and a bit less accurate.)
