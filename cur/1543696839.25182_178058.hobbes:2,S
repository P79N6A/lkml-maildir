The dmesg files you included and posted don't contain much useful 
information relating to this problem.
Forget about usb-storage and hotplug scripts.  If you can't even get to
the point where your device show up in /proc/bus/usb/devices then nothing
else will work.
Judging from your dmesg output, you have an external hub (ALCOR Generic 
USB Hub) into which your device is plugged.  The device contains an 
internal hub (Leading Driver Co., LTD. USB Embedded Hub) and the drive is 
attached through that internal hub.  But an attempt to communicate with 
the drive failed.  It could be a problem with the external hub, the 
internal hub, or the drive itself; it's not likely to be a problem with 
the kernel.  The error message
	hub 2-2.2:1.0: transfer --> -75
indicates a problem with the internal hub, but there's no way to tell what 
that problem is.  The other error message
	usb 2-2.2.1: control timeout on ep0in
indicates a problem communicating with the drive, but that could be caused 
by the internal hub not working right.
You might try plugging your device directly into the PC to see if that 
makes a difference.  Better yet, try plugging your device into a 
completely different PC running Linux 2.6 and see what happens.
