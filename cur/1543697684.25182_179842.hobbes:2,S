Basically, it depends on what kind of equipment you and the enemy have.
If you have special equipment and technique to write a floppy, you can make
a floppy which is not copiable by normal PCs.
But, if the enemy has similar equipment, he can do it.
About 15 years ago, there were many gaming softwares which were procected,
for example, by checking "gap" between sectors.  I also heard that there 
was a technique to change the hole of 5.25" (or 8") floppy for copy 
protection.
