This sounds interesting, but am I correct in assuming that this only allows 
preemption during code that is called from user space?  For instance, it 
would be bad to preempt an ISR or BH, right?  Actually... what happens if 
say, the kernel called from user space is holding a lock, and gets preempted? 
 Is there a mechanism to disable preemption while holding locks or at other 
resources that need to be freed before another task is run?
By the way, are there any other 'modes of execution' for lack of a better 
word, besides IRS, B, and.... 'called from user space', also for lack of a 
better word.  Forgive me, I'm not that familiar with the Linux kernel yet.
