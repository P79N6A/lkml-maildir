Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[PATCH] driver core: Add the ability to bind drivers to devices from userspace
This adds a single file, "bind", to the sysfs directory of every driver
registered with the driver core.  To bind a device to a driver, write
the bus id of the device you wish to bind to that specific driver to the
"bind" file (remember to not add a trailing \n).  If that bus id matches
a device on that bus, and it does not currently have a driver bound to
it, the probe sequence will be initiated with that driver and device.
Note, this requires that the driver itself be willing and able to accept
that device (usually through a device id type table).  This patch does
not make it possible to override the driver's id table.
