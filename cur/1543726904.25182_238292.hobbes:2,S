When there is memory competition among multiple processes,
Which process grabs the token first is important.
A process with its memory demand exceeding the total
ram gets the token first and finally has to give it up 
due to a time-out would have little performance gain from token,
It could also hurt others. Ideally we could make small processes
more easily grab the token first and enjoy the benifis from
token. That is, we want to protect those that are deserved to be
protected. Can we take the rss or other available memory demand
information for each process into the consideration of whether 
a token should be taken, or given up and how long a token is held.
