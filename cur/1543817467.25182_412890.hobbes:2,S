Correct.

How are you reproducing this, through the file system (reading files),
or reading the device? If the former, is the file system definitely
sound - eg does it pass fsck?

It's truly puzzing why the 4k vs 512 would make a difference, except if
the driver really doesn't support that large requests and corrupts the
data somehow. I'm having an extraordinarily hard time imaging how the
SCSI layer could even come up with such a bug.
So everything seems to point us getting wrong data from the hardware,
most likely because of a driver bug in either handling the larger
transfers or the hardware just not liking them very much.

Probably wont tell you much.
