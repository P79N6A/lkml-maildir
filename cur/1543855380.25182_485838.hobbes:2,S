Fair enough.

I already did, but DMA had dropped off in the meanwhile. 
It did burn a dvd without a hitch with DMA=1, though.

Will do. I'll just have to boot first.
It's currently unavailable, as the 
[2416661.676213] attempt to access beyond end of device
[2416661.676216] loop0: rw=0, want=1401620, limit=946048
messages from loop (/dev/hdi is limited to 946048 block as I described) have
filled dmesg.
