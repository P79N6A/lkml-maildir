What I was trying to point out is that the error message is clearly
the result of a problem elsewhere.  Unless the drive firmware is
buggy, or something very strange is going on inside the drive, (bad
internal RAM or something like that), then the kernel did send a
request for a sector which is well out of range.  What caused that
request we don't know - quite possibly corruption of some filesystem
structure on the disk caused that request, but it's important to be
clear that the error message is the expected response to a request for
such a high block number, and doesn't within itself indicate a problem
with the disk.
I.E. Even though there is every chance that the drive is faulty, the
posted error message doesn't indicate a drive failiure in itself, and
you should look elsewhere.
John.
