It's ld.so which passed the prelink'ed address as a hit on a part glibc
itself. Since glibc is prelinked below the executable on PPC and since
my prelink'ed informations are outdated (prelink somewhat broke on PPC
in latest debian SID), the library wouldn't fit, thus mmap tried to
move it upward... to the brk hole. At least that is my explanation, I
didn't trace the code in ld.so

It's not bash, it's ld.so... Note that Andi's patch also fix a potential
similar issue with the free_area_cache, if somebody does a MAP_FIXED to
low addresses, then a un-hinted mmap, then that mmap will have chances
to be put straight after brk, causing the same kind of interesting issues.
So if you don't take Andi's latest patch, maybe you should still take
the part that avoid playing with free_area_cache on MAP_FIXED mappings ?
Ben.
