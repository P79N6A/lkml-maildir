I agree here. For real time audio to be useful, it must be possible to
do while loading the rest of the system heavily. And any audio system
that occasionally dropps a buffer is not much better than a Windoze
based solution, even if it doesn't crash. Upset musicians will take care
of that instead... ;-)

And that in turn, is not compatible with having fun with low latency
audio processing. ;-)

Agree, but if I can chose between unreliable 20 ms latency (at the very
least) and NO WAY to avoid crashing every now and then even if all
plug-ins are "bug free", and rock solid 3 ms latency (or whatever I
like) and the possibility of a crash when using a buggy plug-in, guess
where I'll go...
Besides, the memory protection problem WILL be addressed in one way or
another. If no one else cares, I'll just have to hack it myself when I
get tired of hard-testing all plug-ins in user space before using them
in the RT engine.

What kind of system calls? What resources need to be hard real time in
addition to audio and MIDI ports? I can understand if you want to use
some non-standard devices for soft real time control of an audio
application, but audio and MIDI devices will be hard real time capable,
and a basic set of "routing" plug-ins will handle the usual stuff like
real time MIDI processing and mapping. Passing events as out-of-band
data between an application and Audiality will off course be possible,
but that's soft real time as long as Linux is... Good enough?
I think an intelligently composed set of hard real time plug-ins that
applications can control through real time events (much like a hardware
synth, but a lot more flexible) will open up some quite interesting
possibilites. And it'll work as soon as the code is usable. The "user
annoyance factor" of the current timing problems with Linux will be
reduced far below anything that runs on Windoze or Mac now.
What did I miss here? More detailed explanation of my ideas needed?
I want all weknesses pointed out ASAP, so I can get everything right
from the start. ;-)
