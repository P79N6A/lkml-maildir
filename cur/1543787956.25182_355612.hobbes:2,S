Yes, it does.  But then the next character is a space, and there
is at least one more space-separated field on the line.
That is, Linus's marker marches
    /^---$/
and the first line of a unified patch matches:
    /^--- .*[^ ].*$/
It ain't fancy, but it works.  These patterns
are easily distinguished.

I don't think anyone is relying on those patterns.
