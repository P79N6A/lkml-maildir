Hello linux-kernel hackers,
I downloaded the kernel patch ide.2.2.14.20000124.patch from Andre
Hedrick's site, and applied it to the kernel(2.2.14). After rebooting the
system I did a cat /proc/pci and found the following values:
    Unknown mass storage controller: Triones Technologies, Inc. HPT366 IDE
UltraDMA/66 (rev 1).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 15.  Master Capable.  Latency=120.  Min
Gnt=8.Max Lat=8.
      I/O at 0xb000 [0xb001].
      I/O at 0xb400 [0xb401].
      I/O at 0xb800 [0xb801].
  Bus  0, device  19, function  1:
    Unknown mass storage controller: Triones Technologies, Inc. HPT366 IDE
UltraDMA/66 (rev 1).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 15.  Master Capable.  Latency=120.  Min
Gnt=8.Max Lat=8.
      I/O at 0xbc00 [0xbc01].
      I/O at 0xc000 [0xc001].
      I/O at 0xc400 [0xc401].
So I used the first two values in each set and entered them in the lilo
prompt as follows
Lilo: ide2=0xb000,0xb402 ide3=0xbc000,0xc002
During the boot up procedure the following messages appeared
HPT366: onboard version of chipset, pin1=1 pin2=2
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xb800-0xb807, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:pio
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 99
HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xc400-0xc407, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
hde: ST328040A, ATA DISK drive
ide2 at 0xb000-0xb007,0xb402 on irq 15
which seems correct, but when my system was up and I tried to run a :
fdisk /dev/hde I get the following:
[root@Jufis /root]# fdisk /dev/hde
Unable to open /dev/hde
Any ideas? 
Any comments or suggestions is really appreciated.
TIA,
