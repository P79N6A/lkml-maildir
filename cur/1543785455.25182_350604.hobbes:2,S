Correct cross-toolchain would be picked by some miracle, presumably?
Both for include/asm and for include/asm-um/arch...  And after that
we win a stunning fraction of percent - some of the generated files
do _not_ depend on any target .o, so we will avoid rebuilding them.
Note that in cases when rebuild involving symlink change _is_ possible
(e.g. arm or sh subarch) we already get the right thing - change it in
.config and symlinks will be flipped.
