Is this patch changing anything in hostap.c or is it just a rename of
the file? Patch file is not exactly ideal for this kind of changes and I
hope git has a better way of storing this kind of rename.
I would rather not rename the file, but if this is the only way of
getting the module built in pieces, I'm okay with the change (assuming
nothing else changed in hostap.c in this changeset).

Why were the hostap_{cs,plx,pci} lines changed? I prefer the original
version of those lines (i.e., no extra padding).
