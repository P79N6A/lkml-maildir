setsockopt() exists, which does not have the flaw. (SOL_SOCKET, TCP_DOPUSH)
or something like this. Actually, I would convert TCP_CORK to set of flags
(1 is reserved for current corking), but I feel this operation is more generic
and should be moved to SOL_SOCKET level.
BTW I see no reasons not to move BKL down for ioctl().
It is not a rocket science, plain dumb edit.
