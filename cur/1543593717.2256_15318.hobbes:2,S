I agree, this isn't really a good test case.  I'd rather see what
happens when you fire up a gimp session to edit an image which is
*almost* the size of RAM, or even just 50% the size of ram.  Then how
does that affect your other processes that are running at the same
time?  
This testing could even be automated with the script-foo stuff to get
consistent results across runs, which is the prime requirement of any
sort of testing.  
On another issue, in swap.c we have two defines for buffer_mem and
page_cache, but the first maxes out at 60%, while the cache maxes out
at 75%.  Shouldn't they both be lower numbers?  Or at least equally
sized?
I've set my page_cache maximum to be 60, I'll be trying to test it
over the weekend, but good weather will keep me outside doing other
stuff...
Thanks,
John
