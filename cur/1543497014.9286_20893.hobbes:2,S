Well of course. I did not advocate this as a new method of setting
up a ftp server, but rather it is a method by which one can find out
what happens in such an environment. For instance, one can 'chdir' to
1, init's information directory, but you can 'chdir' to init's cwd
shown in that directory. This shows that, at least for this case, the
"jail" works.
