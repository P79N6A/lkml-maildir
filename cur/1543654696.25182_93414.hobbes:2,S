Subject: Linux 2.4.18 8139too.c driver fix for mii-tool

mii-tool doesn't work with the 8139too.c driver (RTL8139 based network cards).
Internally the driver uses phy ID #'s 32+, but when ioctls are used to
access the phy registers, the ID is masked down to 0-0x1f, so none of them
work properly, and mii-tool fails.
The fix is to change the masking done in the top of netdev_ioctl:
	if (cmd != SIOCETHTOOL) {
		/* With SIOCETHTOOL, this would corrupt the pointer.  */
		data->phy_id &= 0x3f; // was 0x1f (DA) 20021202
		data->reg_num &= 0x1f;
	}
