I had a thought, but I think it's not quite ripe..
NFS server sends the whole directory contents on NFS client opendir,
so that the whole readdir/telldir/seekdir magic can happen on the
client only... which would perhaps also enable a cheap telldir/seekdir,
and would also give a 'fixed view' when adding/deleting files
during readdir.
