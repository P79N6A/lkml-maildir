If you can make small things go fast, everything speeds up.
If you can only make big things go fast only some things speed up.
I want to make small things go fast so everything speeds up.
This isn't whatever OS you are used to dealing with.  Assumptions are
different, and improving streaming read/writes benchmarks are not our
focus.
One of the first rules in storage or OS design is that it better be
reliable, and you patch looks like it will make the VM unreliable.  So
no a design like this will not be agreed to without comment until it
is shown that the VM does not have problems.
