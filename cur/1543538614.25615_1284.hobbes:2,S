Subject: why is trampoline.S code copied for each cpu?

Hi guys,
The arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c:do_boot_cpu() uses setup_trampoline() to
copy the trampoline.S code for each cpu. Why not point all of them to the
same copy? So I looked in trampoline.S and discovered the answer to this
question - because each instance writes some magic number a5a5a5a5 to its
code. Ok, so then the answer becomes - why does it do that?
Any ideas?
Regards,
Tigran
