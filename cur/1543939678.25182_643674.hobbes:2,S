But that doesn't catch the case here, of trying to load a module when
the code itself is already built into the kernel.  For that we are
relying on the sysfs core to tell us we have a duplicate name problem,
which happens much later.
Is there any test you can do sooner, or is relying on the sysfs test
acceptable?
