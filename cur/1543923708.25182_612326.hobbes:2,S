When fixing build errors or warnings please always always quote the
compiler output so that we can see what you're actually fixing.  Saying
"undefined value warning" is pretty useless.
When quoting gcc output, please ensure that LANG=C was set - otherwise gcc
will emit utf gobbledigook which basically never makes it through the
system unscathed.

hrm, OK.  Not linux/irq.h?  I guess not, as cris doesn't appear to support
CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQS.
