bind is not recursive. union-binding on directory gives a different
behaviour of unlink() (underlying file resurfaces). IOW, they are
different animals with different uses. BTW, the usage you've mentioned is
*very* good thing to have - think of make(1) (union-mount atop of CD and
there we go). BTW, we'll have to invent a new name for 
bind(2;Plan9 namespaces) - it clashes with the bind(2;BSD sockets)
