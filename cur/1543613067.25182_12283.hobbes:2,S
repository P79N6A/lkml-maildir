My hardware is a dual proc PII-300.  I was running LTP runalltests.sh
and it was on one of the growfiles tests when this problem occurred. 
The test hung, and I couldn't telnet into the machine or login to it,
but I could switch between VC's.  On the console, I had screenfulls of
errors like this:
Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 11, received 7
req nr_sec 1024, cur_nr_sec 8
Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 14, received 10
req nr_sec 1024, cur_nr_sec 8
Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 13, received 11
req nr_sec 584, cur_nr_sec 8
Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 2, received 1
req nr_sec 16, cur_nr_sec 8
Incorrect number of segments after building list
counted 2, received 1
req nr_sec 16, cur_nr_sec 8
(scsi0:A:5:0): Locking max tag count at 64
After doing a hard reboot ext2 made me do a manual fsck, but it seems ok
now.  I was not able to produce this error in 2.5.1-pre8.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
