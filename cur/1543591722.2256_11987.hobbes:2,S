I'm not up to date with the 2.4 series at the moment, but...
Looking at the figures you're showing, this looks like you have 1024M
of RAM. It used to be necessary to recompile the kernel if you had
more than (going from memory) 976M of RAM, where you had to change a
configuration option to select 2G of paging space instead of the
default 3G thereof, and this looks suspiciously like this problem to
me.
Can anybody confirm whether this limitation still applies?
Best wishes from Riley.
