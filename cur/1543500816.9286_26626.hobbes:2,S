Hi !
I think there is a typo in 2.2.10-ac4 (quick copy-paste?), file
kernel/sysctl.c, line 216 :
#ifdef CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
       {KERN_SHMMAX, "sysrq", &sysrq_enabled, sizeof (int),
        0644, NULL, &proc_dointvec},
#endif
IMO, KERN_SHMMAX (34) should be replaced with KERN_SYSRQ (38) which has
been added to sysctl.h for this.
If I'm wrong, then please excuse me.
Willy
