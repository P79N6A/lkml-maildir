wireless has huge potential on linux
Currently most of vendors have their proprietary Access Points, 
which, for Aiornets example. are just enbedded Motorola processor around 
the same PCMCIA client card.
Those clientcards work point2point, but major vendors have made some
restrictions for to sell Access Points better. 
In this part of the worl we are doing also lots of long-distance links
with that home equipent. Next link I'll install runt ontable 700kB/s
(5.6Mbps)   and is going to be set up for distance of 9 km - alltogether for 
about 800$. This is nothing for near-zero monthly expenses.
To use them at home- it is real luxury, but to beat telecoms, 
they are quite proper tools (outside of city).
