Well, this is the way most OS on the planet deal with SCSI. 
And please explain me why the Linux kernel internally uses these numbers
for driver instancing? Is the Linux kernel a piece of legacy software?

Using SCSI addresses is just the way that works more universally for
sending SCSI commands. There are several OS that don't support /dev/ names
and all other UNIX like OS do not artificial hide the SCSI addresses 
from userland programs.
