This patch doesn't appear to have ever found its way into the trivial git after
it was accepted, and as a result doesn't seem to have made it into 2.6.23 before
the window closed.  Was there a problem?
FWIW, I have a second patch that also doesn't seem to have made it to the trivial git yet... but unlike the patch above, the second one is only a few weeks old and may just be sitting in the old inbox (
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/554613
).
Thanks,
Matt
