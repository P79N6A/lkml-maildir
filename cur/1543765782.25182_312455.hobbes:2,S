Yes, this is correct.

The timer_list you are mentioning is used for events that need to go off
at a certain jiffy. This is not what the scheduler uses.  The
schedule_tick (which keeps track of the time_slices of processes) goes
off at a timer interrupt once a jiffy. This is architecture dependent,
and for x86 you can take a look at arch/i386/kernel/time.c
timer_interrupt.  This is (usually) setup in
arch/i386/mach-default/setup.c. Search for timer_interrupt for the
details, and then follow the trail there.
