silla has another problem. mfunc and devctl are correct. the problems:
- in 2.4 TI1520 is not in the override list, so PCI CSC interrupts are not active
- redoing voltage interrogation: before 2.4.25 when there was no check pcmcia
  was working better for silla (as long as another device was generating
  interrupts) but with the check added cards are not recognized correctly.
- it looks like (i'm not sure) that the socket state is bouncing a bit after card insert
  (the CDETECT bits) so yenta_get_status() returns w/o SS_PENDING too early....
the attached patch fixes it (at least for silla)  and does nothing bad for me...
marcelo, please apply at least the second part of the patch which adds the TI1510/1520.

---patch---
- add the TI1510 and TI1520 to the TI override list
- redo voltage interrogation if none of the voltage bits is set. this also does
  the interrogation when there's no card or a partitial inserted card. some
  bridges may have a wrong state on power up. the check was added to 2.4.25 'cos
  unconditionally doing it breaks on some setups when a card is already
  recognized correctly. this check is still intact with my small modification.
- in yenta_get_status() return SS_PENDING when none of the voltage bits is set
  or a card is only partitiall inserted, but not if there's no card at all.
