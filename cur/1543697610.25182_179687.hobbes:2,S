Linus is right, this is probably a memory leak issue.  There are several areas
that could be the problem:
	- core networking 
	- iptables
		- iptables filter
	- ethernet bridging
	- ethernet driver (rtl8169)
To find/fix the problem, we need to narrow down the scope.  
Things that would help are, what are the iptables rules you are using?
Are there any errors showing up on the ethernet devices?
Also what does the bridge forwarding table look like? are there lots of entries, are
you running spanning tree?
