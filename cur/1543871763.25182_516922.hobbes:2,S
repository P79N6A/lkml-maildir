*shrug*
I wrote the patch mainly to see whether the stuff container folks (Sam Vilain
et al) were complaining abt (that container structure abstraction
inside the kernel is redundant/unnecessary) made sense or not. 
The rcfs patches demonstrate that it is possible to implement resource control
on top of just nsproxy -and- give the same interface that you now
have. In essense, I would say that the rcfs patches are about 70% same as your 
original V7 container patches.
However as I am converting over cpusets to work on top of nsproxy, I
have learnt few things:
container structure in your patches provides for these things:
a.  A way to group tasks
b.  A way to maintain several hierarchies of such groups
If you consider just a. then I agree that container abstraction is
redundant, esp for vserver resource control (nsproxy can already be used
to group tasks).
What nsproxy doesn't provide is b - a way to represent hierarchies of
groups. 
So we got several choices here.
1. Introduce the container abstraction as is in your patches
2. Extend nsproxy somehow to represent hierarchies
3. Let individual resource controllers that -actually- support
   hierarchical resource management maintain hierarchy in their code.
In the last option, nsproxy still is unaware of any hierarchy. Some of
the resource objects it points to (for ex: cpuset) may maintain a
hierarchy. For ex: nsproxy->ctlr_data[cpuset_subsys.subsys_id] points to
a 'struct cpuset' structure which could maintains the hierarchical
relationship among cpuset objects.
If we consider that most resource controllers may not implement hierarchical 
resource management, then 3 may not be a bad compromise. OTOH if we
expect *most* resource controllers to support hierarchical resource
management, then we could be better of with option 1.
Anyway, summarizing on "why nsproxy", the main point (I think) is about
using existing abstraction in the kernel.

it "should" disappear yes, although I haven't carefully studied the
unshare requirements yet.

That was mainly to keep it simple for a proof-of-concept patch! We can add it 
back later.

I am almost done with the conversion. And yes cpuset is a beast to
convert over! Will test and send the patches out tomorrow.
