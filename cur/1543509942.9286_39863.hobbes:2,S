	Hmmm...  Not sure about this one...  I'm not having this problem
at all with my setups.  Interestingly enough, my systems don't even HAVE
a /etc/ttytype file and the man page on getty specifies the terminal type
set on the command like.  There's also no reference to /etc/ttytype in
the man pages for getty or mgetty.  I haven't used /etc/ttytype since
working on old SCO systems.
	Have you tried setting the terminal type on the command line in
the inittab file like this:
s0:345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS0 38400 wy50
                                       ^^^^

	I've actually seen this, some time ago.  Some "dumb tubes" end up
dragging down CF and DSR when powered off.  I remember seeing a "dongle"
with some pull-up resistors to fix that.  You got a hardware problem there.
What'cha got?  Some old Wyse 50/60/75's or some old VT100's?

	man gettydefs
	All three of those sound like the wrong gettydefs configuration.
Since most of the "getty's" I use refer back to gettydefs for their setup
and configuration, I would expect them to act very similarly.  Certainly,
assuming your hardware is wired correctly, HUPCL and CLOCAL are gettydefs
options.

	I use this and haven't had any problems.  I've got hardwired
connections, modem connections and cross-coupled consoles between systems.
Only thing I had to do was fine tune the gettydefs file or chose the right
gettydefs entry initially.  This all sounds like configuration problems.
Oh...  And I don't think I was able to get 115.2 working for the cross
coupled consoles, because lilo doesn't support that speed (although the
kernel does).
	Other problem I DID run into was when the morons who assembled the
Mandrake distribution came up with the bright idea of putting the cutesy
color ascii penguin in /etc/issue.  That totally hoses any serial logins
(modem or direct) because the file has term type Linux escape codes in it
and lord only knows what you are connecting with...  Grrrr....

	Hmmm...  I don't use agetty.  I use getty for hardwired, mingetty
on the consoles, and mgetty for modems.  Don't know about agetty.  Don't
even have it on any of my RedHat, Mandrake, or TurboLinux systems...
