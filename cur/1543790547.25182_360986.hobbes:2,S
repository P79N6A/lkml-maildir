Yes... semantics aside it is obviously something we want to eliminate
if possible.

That sounds like a reasonable avenue to investigate. There was
something similar there before, but I found that there was a sharp
point where runqueue lengths got just the right length for performance
characteristics of some things to change.
This could have been made worse by inadequate cache-hot estimate though.
One thing I will look into is to check whether we can use previous
wakeup patterns to check whether the pattern looks random, or affine to
some group of CPUs. This could potentially allow us to have stronger
affinity than we currently do for the "good" workloads, while eliminating
task movement completely for bad cases.
Something along the lines of the attached patch may be 'good enough',
though I'd like to try a few other things as well.

No that's true - I didn't mean to imply that your patch would
completely eliminate this input.
Thanks,
