    I don't really need to use ext2, I just was curious. I have a couple
of pendrives and I was thinking about using one of them to store a
"live" copy of my home. So, I wanted ext2 for that. I can access the
data from Windows if I need to, but usually I try not to touch a Windows
even with a 100 mts pole ;)
    Portability (so to speak), is not important for me.

    That's the answer I was looking for ;))) I mean, will the pendrive
have problems with ext2 due to some strange behaviour of the hardware? I
know about cheap pendrives that you cannot format even with FAT32, only
with FAT16. The pendrive I was considering to have the "live" copy of my
home was a Kingston Data Traveler.
    Of course, I can go with a loopback: this way I'll have a "live"
backup of my home, with all UNIX metadata saved but able to reside on a
FAT16 filesystem. Not very comfortable, given that I won't use it
outside Linux (probably).
    I just was curious about the issue and I was asking to know if
anybody had tried this.
