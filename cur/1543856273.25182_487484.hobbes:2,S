Subject: [PATCH 29/36] sysfs: sysfs_write_file() writes zero terminated data
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Thomas Maier <balagi@justmail.de>
since most of the files in sysfs are text files,
it would be nice, if the "store" function called
during sysfs_write_file() gets a zero terminated
string / data.
The current implementation seems not to ensure this.
(But only if it is the first time the zeroed buffer
page is allocated.)
So the buffer can be scanned by sscanf() easily,
for example.
This patch simply sets a \0 char behind the
data in buffer->page.
