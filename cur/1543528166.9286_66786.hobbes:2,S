I have had several (about 1/month) complete lockups with Mandrake 6.1
(2.2.13/AMD K6), but no reason to blame it on diald.
The last one was pretty scary as there was a lot of system activity
and a manual fsck was required (my first one in six years using
Linux!).  There were lots of filesystem errors, but all corrected
properly and nothing was lost.  The PPP link had come up just before
the crash, but the connection was complete and the ip-up script was
running.  There were no kernel messages logged.
