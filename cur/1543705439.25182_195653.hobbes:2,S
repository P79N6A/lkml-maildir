I quite agree.  My first crack was ugliness in isolation, because I
anticipated resistance to changing the function signatures in the fault
path and it seemed like a fair bit of twiddling would be required.

It would be ideal.  However, it would also require changing the interfaces
further.  Currently handle_mm_fault just says what happened, and doesn't
give back the page directly.  get_user_pages then retakes
mm->page_table_lock and calls follow_page to look up the page.
So either handle_mm_fault would need to be able to return the page
directly, or else follow_page would need to be changed to do "force"
lookups that don't bail out when the pte is unwritable.  i.e.:

Off hand I'm not positive that is sufficient to get all the cases right
once the fault installs the proper permissions, though perhaps it is.
Remember, there is not only the writing unreadable case, but the case of
reading and writing unreadable (PROT_NONE) as well.
Then there is the issue of not making the pte writable in the first place.
pte_mkwrite is used to construct the pte in a variety of places I can see
off hand in memory.c (break_cow, do_wp_page, do_swap_page,
do_anonymous_page, do_no_page), and I haven't traced all the hugetlbpage
code paths that are also written this way.  Perhaps it would be sufficient
to change all these pte_mkwrite(pte) into pte_modify(pte, vma->vm_page_prot).
But I am not really confident right off that I know everything that's going
on here.
I've outlined the changes that I think would be sufficient (plus figuring
out the analogous changes to hugetlb stuff).  I'd be happy to give it a
try.  But I'm not at all confident to begin with that I'm aware of all the
pitfalls.
Thanks,
Roland
