Would you try the ChangeSet 1.188, specifically the one for
fs/buffer.c@1.52?
http://linuxvm.bkbits.net:8088/vm-2.4/diffs/fs/buffer.c@1.52?nav=index.html
|ChangeSet@-2d|cset@1.188
I agree that rmap12c + the above fix has noticeable improvements over
the 11 series. I'll be pushing some numbers out later today.
