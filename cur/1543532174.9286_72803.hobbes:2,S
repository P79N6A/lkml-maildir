Eeek.  That still leaves the possibility that a setreuid() will leave
other threads still processing data with the old uid, which probably
violates posix.  It's also an incredibly ugly solution.  Just signal
each task from in user space to force them to change local uid, and 
you don't need any kernel help whatsoever.
Remember, for things like file server tasks, you _want_ separate 
credentials for each thread, so that individual threads can serve data
to different uids safely.  Putting POSIX uid support into the kernel 
is insane if the functionality isn't performance-critical, since it will
add complexity to many fast paths in the kernel.
