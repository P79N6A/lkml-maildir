I like the gdoc stuff Alan is using to document the network-code.
Please consider using gdoc as well.
It has some neat advantages:
* The "source" of the documentation is in the code itself (in a special
format C comment), so when someone changes a parameter, he/she will see the
documentation as well and change that too.
* It can generate a lot of output formats (sgml, html, man, etc)
