Subject: 2.2.7ac1 breaks mmap over NFS

Greetings!  We have some code which extends a largish file (~8MB) by
lseeking past its end and writing a byte of zeros. The file is then
mmapped, and new data is written into the extended region, and
connected with older data.  The app is relatively bulletproof; been
working since 1997 on a daily basis.  This had been working across
NFS.  We just upgraded the server and client to 2.2.7ac1, and
basically it seems as though the newly extended region does not return
zeros on reading.  The code dies with data corruption errors across
NFS, but works just fine when run from the NFS server, where the disk
hosting the database is locally mounted.  
Would be happy to test any suggestions, if this would help.
Take care,
