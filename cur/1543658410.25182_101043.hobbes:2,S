Thanks for spotting this, after reading kernel/module.c it seems obvious 
to me that you are right. The following simple patch fixes it:
--- linux-2.5.54/init/Kconfig.old	2003-01-08 00:05:12.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.5.54/init/Kconfig	2003-01-08 00:05:38.000000000 +0100

+	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD && EXPERIMENTAL
 	help
 	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
 	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
