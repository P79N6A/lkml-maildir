Me too.

Yes, that's what it does.

I would like to make it generic too. CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_MEMORY has the
advantage of snd_memory_done() which can detect memory leaks in their
modules automatically. Therefore, to replace the ALSA magic allocator,
we would need to track which module did the allocation and add hooks to
module_exit.
