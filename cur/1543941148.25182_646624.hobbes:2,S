I am afraid that Ted-san is concerning about the fact that the freeze
program can touch the target filesystem by mistake (rather than just
close() and its journal behavior)
# cd /mnt
# freeze /mnt > ./logfile
This is more unclear to admins than "rm -rf /" case.
So we need to implement some bail-out mechanism as he pointed out,
such that if kernel noticed that the freezer is trying to touch
the target filesystem, kernel would kill the freezer and
automatically unfreeze the filesystem again.
