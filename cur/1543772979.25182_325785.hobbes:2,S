My documentation says:
lea reg16, mem
Available on 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386, 80486
32-bit-extension available
Opcode: 8D mod reg r/m
reg will be the target register (AX .. DI), and mod and r/m will select
something like a direct address, a register or a combination like 
BP+DI+ofs (I won't copy the table). A multiplier is not mentioned there.
