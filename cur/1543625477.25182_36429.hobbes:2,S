 This does not make sense -- fiddling with 8259A chips does not assure
maskable interrupts won't arrive.  They still may come from the APIC bus
and from local APIC sources.  And you don't really want to handle
interrupts in the SMI mode unless you know details of the operating system
running -- if you execute an iret instruction NMIs get enabled and even
more mess may happen (this may be the reason of some systems failing with
the NMI watchdog enabled).

 There are two ways I can think of at the moment:
1. Don't touch it at all.  It's the preferred way if possible, as it
doesn't change the hardware's state.
2. Use alternate registers dedicated to save/restore the hardware's state
(typically used for power management), that provide details beyond the
standard ones.  Of course if a particular implementation doesn't have ones
(are there any these days?), you don't really have a choice apart from #1
above.
