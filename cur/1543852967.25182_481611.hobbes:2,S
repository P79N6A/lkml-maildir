Right. Only the kernel runs in privilege level (ring) 0.

You don't. Well, you could put it in the kernel...

That's a false assumption. Even kernel code is preemptible nowadays.

If you run your program on an otherwise idle machine, the results should 
be pretty accurate.
If you really think it matters, then run your program with real-time
