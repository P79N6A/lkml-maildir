The problem isn't extract_entropy(), as much as the fact that we're
calling it from check_and_rekey(), which in turn is being called by
the secure TCP sequence number generation code.  If you are looking
for a more localized way of getting rid of the probably while
minimizing the amount of code that's being disabled, you can simply do
this instead:

WARNING: this will effectively disable the secure TCP sequence

attacks --- but if you cared about such attacks, you'd be using Real
Crypto in your application progams anyway...

I doubt SHA_CODE_SIZE will make a sufficient difference to avoid the
latency problems.  What we would need to do is to change the code so
that the rekey operation in __check_and_rekey takes place in a
workqueue.  Say, something like this (warning, I haven't tested this
patch; if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces):
