1. you can swap over NBD
2. if you point me to the swap-over-nfs patches you
   have found, I can try to make them work on 2.4 ;)
[I have some interest in making swap-over-nfs work and
most of the other VM things in 2.4 are already pretty
stable ... at the moment stability is more important
than extra performance tricks to me]

Rik
