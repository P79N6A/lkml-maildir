I uninstalled the NVIDIA drivers and tried again with the nv x.org driver. 
Same problem.  I also tried remaining in text mode (with no NVIDIA drivers 
loaded).  Same problem.  In both cases it occurs when I start seriously 
loading the CPU.
One thing that may be of interest is that the message in dmesg is 
different if I'm in text mode vs. x.org.  If I'm in text mode the message 
is:
Losing some ticks... checking if CPU frequency changed.
If I'm running x.org then I get
warning: many lost ticks.
Your time source seems to be instable or some driver is hogging interupts
rip default_idle+0x20/0x30
OK, I'll open a bug report in bugzilla.  I don't think this is the same as 
bug #3341.  My clock comes up normal 100% of the time on boot up.  Things 
only go awry when I start putting a load on the CPU.
Thanks very much for your help, and please cc. me if you find anything out 
since I'm not a regular subscriber.
