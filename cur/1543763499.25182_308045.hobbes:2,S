Can you try replacing flush_cache_all() with the following?
	ioread32(ioaddr + CSR12);
	udelay(500);	/* random delay until someone looks up what is spec'd */

Erm...the code in parisc-linux tree won't have the COBALT hacks.
You might try adding selective bits from the parisc-linux tulip.
That fact the flush_cache_all() changes the behavior made me
wonder if IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE is set in the pci resource.
But that doesn't seem to matter for ppc (32 or 64).
Notes on what I learned below.
arch/ppc64/kernel/iomap.c doesn't look at that flag.
arch/ppc/kernel/io.c:pci_ioremap() has the nice comment:
	        if (flags & IORESOURCE_MEM)
                /* Not checking IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE because PPC does
                 * not currently distinguish between ioremap and
                 * ioremap_nocache. 
                 */
                return ioremap(start, len);
ioremap resolves to:
void __iomem *
ioremap64(unsigned long long addr, unsigned long size)
{
        return __ioremap(addr, size, _PAGE_NO_CACHE);
}
I *think* (too many ifdefs) ppc64 does the same in arch/ppc64/mm/init.c.
Cacheing is clear not an issue for accessing MMIO space via pci_iomap().
