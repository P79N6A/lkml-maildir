Amazingly you've hit one of the few problems caused by something outside
the kernel tree.  db v1.85 has been superceded by db2 and db3.  db1 is
where the "original" Berkeley db stuff now lives.  Apparently aicasm
needs db 1.
So, update your packages, or create the proper symlinks if you've
already got db1 installed in some other location.
