make oldconfig: some new options should default to 'N'?
Examples:
Sony Laptop Extras (ACPI_SONY) [M/n/y/?] (NEW)
Enable firmware EDID (FB_FIRMWARE_EDID) [Y/n/?] (NEW)
Alsa:
Why do I want these by default?
OSS PCM (digital audio) API - Include plugin system (SND_PCM_OSS_PLUGINS) [Y/n/?] (NEW)
Verbose procfs contents (SND_VERBOSE_PROCFS) [Y/n/?] (NEW)
RTC class (RTC_CLASS) [Y/n/m/?] (NEW) ?
I used a .config from 2.6.16-rc4 then make oldconfig.  In general I'd 
expect new features to default off.  There's others too, but I'd have 
to start from scratch to fins them all.  Not in summer time ;)
