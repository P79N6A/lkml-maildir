ah... you are referring to my ipqmpd (ip queue multiplex daemon). Yes, it
is not very efficient. But it is right now the only way to have multiple
processes using the ip_queue. 
The ideal solution is a queue handler which does in fact handle more than
one queue from inside the kernel. Unfortunately nobody got around writing
it yet.

well... the ip_queue module as opposed to your implementation as iptables
target has the following advantages:
- can be used from each netfilter-hook attached code (not only from 
  an ip table)
- is more generic (you can register different queue handler, ipv6, ...)
btw: please move this discussion to netfilter-devel@lists.samba.org
