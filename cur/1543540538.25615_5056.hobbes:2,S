My workstation has 238 processes. I run into the 128 window limit
lately.
People are using "button bar" applications. Maybe that's a good
optmization.  I use a one-liner application that pops up a button, and
executes the rest of the commandline when pressed. However, that does
cost 20 processes for 20 of those buttons.
Designing good software means that the code size should be kept small.
Now, this is often done for say ftp-servers too. You have a single
threaded application handling just one client. 
When you run into trouble with this tactic, you redesign and make one
deamon handle a bunch of clients with a big select loop in the middle.
Oh, Not everybody has recent hardware. It would be a pitty if the
low-end would be forgotten: I have two "older" computers that no
longer work well as workstations that end up their lifecycle as
development machines. They have the "new cards with driver that crashes
the machine" type of workload.... 
So, Gerrit, your list should start at 
	16 to 64M RAM
	P-100 to Ppro-200 processor
	0-2G disk
