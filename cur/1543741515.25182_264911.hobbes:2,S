The $(wildcard ...) function was executed before you created the file.
If we shall retreive the version from a SCM then as you already do
must hide it in a script.
I want the script only to be executed when we actually ask kbuild to
build a kernel - so it has to be part of the prepare rule set.
Furthermore I like to avoid a dependency on perl for a basic kernel.
Can you retreive the version from bk using a simple shell script?
