In this case I absolutely agree with you.
In this case it is also _possible_ because all access
to these data structures goes through the filesystem
code, so the filesystem knows exactly which object is
a candidate for freeing and which isn't.
I think the last messages from the thread were a
miscommunication between us -- I was under the impression
that you wanted per-filesystem freeing decisions for things
like page cache pages.
kind regards,
Rik
