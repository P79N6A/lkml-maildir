Does poweroff work?  I cannot get it to work in 2.4.13...
Is this to be expected?  ACPI poweroff worked for me in
2.4.4 and 2.4.7, but alot of new options have been added
since then, maybe I just misconfigured it?
Oh and acpid does not work anymore in 2.4.13, should that
be upgraded too?
Thanks,
Mike
