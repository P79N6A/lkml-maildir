Another thing that I forgot to mention is that I have some doubts as
to the current generic_synchronize_irq() implementation.  Given that
IRQs are now preemptible, a higher priority RT thread calling
synchronize_irq can't just spin waiting for the IRQ to complete, as
it never will (and it wouldn't be a great idea for non-RT tasks
either).  I see that a do_hardirq() call was added, presumably to
hurry completion of the interrupt, but is that really safe?  It looks
like that could end up re-entering handlers, and you'd still have a
partially executed handler after synchronize_irq() finishes (causing
not only an extra end() call, but possibly code being executed after
it's been unloaded, and other synchronization violations).
If I'm missing something, please let me know, but I don't see a good
way to implement it without blocking for the IRQ thread's completion
(such as with the per-IRQ waitqueues in M5).
