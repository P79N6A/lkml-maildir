Hi,
I've a little problem with my new MacBook and Linux running EFI  
(without BIOS emulation) : when it loads the intel_agp module, the  
screen goes gray with colored stripes". I've tried to load the  
"agpgart" module alone, it works (this one is used by intel_agp).
Also, the framebuffer works perfectly (only using  
video=imacfb:macbook), and intel_agp works using BIOS emulation.
Thats what the kernel says (thanks to ssh :) ) :
Linux agpgart interface v0.101 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected an Intel 945GM Chipset.
agpgart: Detected 16124K stolen memory.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0x80000000
I forgot ! I use 2.6.17.11 with mactel-linux patches (but it looks it  
doesn't patch intel_agp).
Thanks in advance
Alexis ROBERT
