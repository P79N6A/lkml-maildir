   So, the SO_BSDCOMPAT messages are in all
   likelihood unrelated to the problems I'm seeing
   with bind-9.2.1 under 2.5.6x-recent kernels...
   I guess I'll have to turn up the debugging on
   bind and see if anything unusual pops up -
If bind errors internally because it cannot
set SO_BSDCOMPAT, this is likely the problem.
You need to hack the bind sources to remove references
to SO_BSDCOMPAT.
