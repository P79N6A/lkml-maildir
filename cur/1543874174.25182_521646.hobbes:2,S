A fairly contrived example, but I see your point.  Of course any system 
can be broken.  I think that user-level scheduling is good for real 
multi user systems, where 'user' means a person, not an artificial 
entity.  It's also good for a multi application server, where typically 
each service runs (or can be made to run) as a separate user.

Perhaps we need a scheduling class instead, defaulting to each user 
being in its own class, and system processes in another (or maybe more 
than one) class.  Root can configure the relative priorities of the 
various classes according to preferences.

That's why I wanted the job abstraction, which currently isn't 
communicated to the kernel (or at least not well).  Within a user's 
quota, jobs are scheduled fairly.

For multiuser systems, it also has to provide predictable response to 
unpredictable loads.  RSDL accomplishes part of this by removing 
heuristics.  User-level scheduling does more by limiting the impact of a 
single user to 1/N of the system's cpu capacity, and similarly limits 
the impact of a single job to 1/number_of_active_jobs_for_this_user.
