Hi, thanks for answering me!
If i find something out i will let you know.
THe last info i got is that it is somehow possible with smartmon tools.
(a la smartctl -d megaraid,0 /dev/sda)
I am asking smartmontools developers right now, because there is no out of the 
box support for megaraid.
Also i was told that there is a binary monitoring tool from lsi-logic page.
But will it work with open source driver?
