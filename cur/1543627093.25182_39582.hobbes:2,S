/dev is for devices, why do you use it for mounting filesystems?
I use /mnt/xxx or custom top-level dirs for mounts.
For example, I have /.share mounted to common NFS storage,
/.local mount --bind'ed to local (i.e. per-workstation) storage,
/mnt/auto is for automounter (local disk access, SMB etc)
and symlinks:
/usr -> /.share/usr
/home -> /.share/home
...
/tmp -> /.local/tmp
/var -> /.local/var
...
This works just fine for me.
