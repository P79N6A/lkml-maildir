You could, but why would you want to?
If your processor has VM then wou will be better of
using it. Without VM you suffer more problems from
free memory fragmentation, no dynamically growing
stacks, ne memory protection between kernel and
processes, etc.
There are currently no patches for processors with
VM to run with the CONFIG_NO_MMU support of uClinux.
(There would be a little bit of work to do if you
wanted to).
Regards
Greg
