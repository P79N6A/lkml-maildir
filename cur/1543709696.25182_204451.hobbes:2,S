Hmm. Can you try unapplying it and applying the one in 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107506063605497&w=2
instead? Does it work for you as well as with no patch?

My situation is the other way round. I was always unable to suspend my
laptop under Linux until I tried the 2.5.x series first. That one
worked; however, in 2.6.0-test4 someone did some major changes and
removed these two calls as well. So I could not suspend in 2.6.0-test4
till 2.6.1, now U can again :-)

Same for me. Dunno if my or your BIOS is borked, but one is surely
broken.

Where do you read something about powering down devices after suspend?
The process is:
1- suspend devices
2- (power down devices w/ my patch)
3- asm call to put cpu in suspend mode - it will not return 
   until you wake it up again
4- (power up devices w/ my patch)
5- resume devices

HTH,
