From a quick glance at someone elses implementation of it, I plan on
walking up the dentries and checking at each level if a watcher on that
level is interested in events from subdirectories. Is this good practice in
the kernel?

The inode will be pinned down, I haven't implemented this yet but I am
going to change the inode cache (is this the right place? )
so that if inode->watcher_count > 0 the inode stays pinned. Then when
the filesystem is unmounted, we will kick off all the watchers on
each inode.

Like I said above,as long as an inode has a watcher it will be pinned. As
for the races, I plan on implementing locking around all of the list operations.
Perhaps I wasn't very clear that this is very much a WIP and lots of work is
needed.

Having directory event notification without needing to keep a file open on the
device is not broken by design. It is the only reasonable solution to
a problem that needs fixing. You can't simply say that a file manager
needing to be notified when directories change is broken. How would
you solve this problem?
