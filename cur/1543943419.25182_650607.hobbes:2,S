Subject: [PATCH 11/9 update] firewire: fw-sbp2: enforce a retry of __scsi_add_device if bus generation changed

Subject: firewire: fw-sbp2: enforce a retry of __scsi_add_device if bus generation changed
fw-sbp2 is unable to reconnect while performing __scsi_add_device
because there is only a single workqueue thread context available for
both at the moment.  This should be fixed eventually.
An actual failure of __scsi_add_device is easy to handle, but an
incomplete execution of __scsi_add_device with an sdev returned would
remain undetected and leave the SBP-2 target unusable.
Therefore we use a workaround:  If there was a bus reset during
__scsi_add_device (i.e. during the SCSI probe), we remove the new sdev
immediately, log out, and attempt login and SCSI probe again.

The previous patch "firewire: fw-sbp2: retry login if scsi_device was
offlined early" should be folded into this one before upstream
submission.
