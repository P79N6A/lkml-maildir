Compaq still support PDP's because they are still in active use. I know of
sites that still run PDP-11's!!
We were selling *new* microVAXen up until Nov '99!!
So I guarantee you that in 2038 there will still be plenty of 32-bit
hardware in active use. Certainly enough to make time_t be a problem. (just
think of embedded systems).
