Hi
I compiled test13-pre3 a few minutes ago and when running
make modules_install I got this:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.0-test13-pre3/kernel/fs/ext2/ext2.o
depmod:         buffer_insert_inode_queue
depmod:         fsync_inode_buffers
As you may have noticed I have ext2 as a module, I have reiserfs as main
filesystem here on this system. This is not a critical error to me.
I havn't tried to compile ext2 into kernel.
.config is availiable if anyone wants it.
