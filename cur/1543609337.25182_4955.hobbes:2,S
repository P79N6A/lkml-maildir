Hi,
I'm glad to see you guys are working on a common acl api for ext2/3 and xfs.
I was just wondering if this api provided what would be needed for linux 
to support NTFS's acls.
Now bare in mind I know little about how NTFS's alc's are implimented or 
if they follow POSIX at
all. But I just thought it might be worth asking the ntfs maintainer if 
the proposed api would be
adaquit to support ntfs's acls on linux should they ever want to 
impliment this. Might save them
headaches someday.
Also will it supply the interface needed for other filesystems that have 
been ported that linux that
support acls? (i.e. will it work for them, could they use it in the 
future if/when they decide to
impliment that feature) I think JFS might support acls too.
Sorry to be a bother,
Tim
