Hi,
  I have one of the Jumptec tiny 486 PCs with 16MB RAM, 16MB flash disc
and very little else and have used a shell script as /bin/init.
  Once I start putting quite a few things in there (say a few explicit
bash startups on separate consoles) I see segmentation faults from every
day programs (bash, cat, strace to name a few).
  However if I insert a sleep between the commands (3 seconds seems OK),
then it works fine.
  This is running Kernel 2.2.12 (RH version); it is running without any
swap and the filesystem is on its flash IDE disc.
  If it was seg'ing all the time I'd presume bad ram/libraries/mood  - but
the fact the sleep is making it work (reliably) confuses me.
  ideas?
Dave
