This is normal behaviour ... the current implementation of kapm-idled
means that it is sleeping some of the time, so the real idle process
actually gets some time.  I did a patch a while ago the got the kapm-idled
up to about 93-95%, but I didn;t think i was all that important.

Again this is normal (although it may not seem sensible).

I have NEVER seen kapmd getting 100%.  You are probably getting
about as good power saving as you will get (unfortunately) although
don't hold me to that - I have heard of some laptops that get better
power savings when CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE was NOT set ...
Cheers,
Stephen
