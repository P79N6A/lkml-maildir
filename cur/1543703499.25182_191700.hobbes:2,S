Hi, 
   I am trying to port a C++ kernel module from 2.4 to
2.6. (It is MIT Click Modular Router). 
   As I understand the module building has changed in
ver 2.6. I have got the Makefile to compile it but it
gives me lot of warning - all dependancies problem 
 It appears that the kernel Makefile treats it like a
host application and does not pass the necessary
processing routines.
  Does anyone can ideas about how to change the kernel
makefile to compile the C++ files the same way as C
files ? 
Any help will be appreciated. 
Ashish
