Thanks. I can see /proc/mtd but there is no /dev/mtd0 (or anything mtd in /dev).
And still all I see in sysfs is the mtd class directory no dev file.
Module                  Size  Used by
mtdram                  2884  0
mtdchar                 5000  0
mtdcore                 5760  3 mtdram,mtdchar
I just tried it on a clean 2.6.6-rc1 kernel and the same thing happened. Created
a /proc/mtd but no /dev/mtd*
So either Im doing something wrong or there is a bug of some sort...
Thanks a lot.
