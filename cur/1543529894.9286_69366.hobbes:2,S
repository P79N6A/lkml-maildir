My first version had this feature, but it was an ugly hack and I did
not find a way to reliably export this to user space without further
hacks.
Unfortunately the fs does not get the mount point from anywhere. The
only function called by the VFS ist read_super, which does not get the
information. If you want to autodetect, you have to play tricks with
dcache and the path to your root inode.

I am very open to proposals for other mount point defaults. But
personally I really do not like any further root directory cluttering.
Another idea would be /dev/shm like /dev/pts but I wanted to avoid
clashes with devfs.

I think Alans patch is making that possible. I will check his
proposal today (hopefully).
