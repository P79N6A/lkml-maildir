I did not want to disturb anybody who was already using the performance
counters for tuning so I made NMI for UP optional.  You prefer to make
NMI for UP mandatory, change the existing behaviour and force people
who use performance counters to turn off EVNTSEL1 themselves.  And they
must remember to reprogram EVNTSEL1 to reactivate NMI after they have
finished tuning.
This is a philosophical difference, not a technical one, we will just
have to agree to disagree.  Either way it will be nice to get NMI for
UP into the standard kernel.
