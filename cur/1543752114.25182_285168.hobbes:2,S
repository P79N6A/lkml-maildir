Greetings YH,
That patch will cause phys_proc_id[] to contain incorrect information 
for IBM x366 systems.  There is a reason why phys_pkg_id() indirects 
through the subarch table -- it does so because cpuid returns stale 
data when the APIC ID registers are rewritten by the x366 BIOS.  The 
BIOS must rewrite those registers as part of system probing and 
configuration (i.e. Nocona chips can't latch all 8 bits of APIC ID at 
reset time, and we will need all 8 bits real soon).
Personally, I don't have any problem with replacing the non-power-of-2 
code with "hweight32(c->x86_num_cores - 1)", but folks at Intel have 
been very insistent that it may be needed in the future.  Maybe Suresh 
can speak up about Intel's interests here.
