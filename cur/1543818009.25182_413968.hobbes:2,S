That would be nice. I assumed they needed root for security reasons 
rather than architectural reasons.

I'm not sure I understand. Only if you run that program, and if you 
don't have access to the intermediate directory, how do you run it?

Why is mounting proc a bad thing? I have never seen a Linux distro that 
does not provide proc and many desktop-level things depend on it.

You could argue the same for any new feature. Writing relocatable 
software on UNIX is absolutely standard, except it's done at source 
compile time not runtime. That fits with the traditional UNIX culture of 
compiling software to install it, but the times they are a changin :)

How so? The code does work, though I guess you could devise a scenario 
in which there is a running executable that is not attached to any 
directory.
