CONFIG_PARAVIRT is not being used to guard asm/paravirt.h from multiple 
inclusion.  In places where it is being used to guard #include 
<asm/paravirt.h>, the idea is that asm/paravirt.h defines various 
inlines/macros which would otherwise be defined in the header.  So, for 
example, asm/desc.h would normally define load_gdt() in the 
!CONFIG_PARAVIRT case, but asm/paravirt.h defines it when 
CONFIG_PARAVIRT is enabled. 
In this case, asm/paravirt.h included because we need the definition for 
paravirt_enabled(), not because it is replacing any of bugs.h's definitions.
