Hello,
I couldn't figure out why my brandnew kernel-thingie wouldn't boot. But after 2 days I figured it out: The help system in the kernel configuration says that if you include MISC binary support in the kernel you don't need the ELF support. Well.. IT'S WRONG! Because if you don't include the ELF support you get an error message like "Kernel Panic: No init found" during boot
Maybe this misunderstanding can be fixed in the next kernelversion? :)
BTW: Sorry if i sent this to the wrong email addy, if i did maybe you can bounce it to the correct address. Thank you!
Adios!
