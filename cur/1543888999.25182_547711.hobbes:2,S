Yeah, this is the classic "select" trap.

You're right ... we'd discussed this earlier in:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/16/257
and 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/16/237
Also, because dependencies are of two types, those that _can_ be
meaningfully selected and those that can't, so we could select _all_
grand-parent dependencies A's of C when user picks C if they are all
selectable, but just refuse to proceed to even pick C itself if _any_
grand-parent dependency A of C is not a "select"able dependency.
i.e., a mix of the two solutions you mentioned above.

Yes, the real problem is when a "depends on" somewhere along the
dependency tree has a || somewhere in it -- so we don't exactly know which
branch to follow from that point when creating the dependency tree. But I
suspect this shouldn't really be such a show-stopper ... I'll see if I can look
into scripts/kconfig/*.c to try and implement something of this sort.
