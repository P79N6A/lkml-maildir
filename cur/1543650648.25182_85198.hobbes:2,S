Whether its a userspace thing or DM is simply told by the hptraid driver
to do the work for it is an open question yes

OSS hasnt worked on SMP between about 2.5.35 and 2.5.44 so I dont think
its that major 8)

It compiles I've got to put stuff together to do the full test runs on
it yet. The code is actually a lot cleaner with the new block layer,
much more scalable and also Al Viro took a hatchet to bits of it when
tidying the block layer so the disk add/remove and other stuff has also
improved dramatically. The fast path for I/O now executes a mere four
instructions within the driver under a spinlock on i2o_block 8)
Mostly I'm working on the NCR5380 first. That happens to be attached to
my scanner so spinning for 15 seconds in IRQ context is annoying me 8)
