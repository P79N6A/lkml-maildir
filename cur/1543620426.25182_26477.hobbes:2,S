I have a problem here since I plugged my second hard disk on my Promise
Ultra 100 TX2 PDC20268 controller. It occurs all the time when I use software
raid 0. I looked at the LKML archives, and this problem does not seems to be
solved. There is a simpler way to generate the problem than to use raid.
It occurs when I use dd for reading on my both hard disks in parallel.
The disks are both masters of their channel.
When I do this test, The message I get is 
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ15.
And I can look at /proc/interrupts and see the ERR counter increment at
a phenomenal speed.
I wonder if this problem is due to the linux driver support or if it is
a hardware bug.
