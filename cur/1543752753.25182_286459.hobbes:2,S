Well IMO that would be preferable if there are no other objections.
I can't think how any sort of unprivileged "real time" scheduling
would have a place on multi-user systems.
And if it is only really used on single user systems then presumably
the priority elevation isn't a big problem provided it can be properly
managed. So this would appear to be the better solution.
Supposing you do want some sort of DOS prevention in the system, I'd
much prefer it be handled by a trusted user-space daemon for example,
rather than scheduler smarts (which may require a little bit of work
to limit priorities but would be relatively straightforward).
