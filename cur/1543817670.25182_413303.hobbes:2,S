Are you simply suggesting that the rcu_dereference() in:
	/* install the keyring */
       	spin_lock_irqsave(&tsk->sighand->siglock, flags);
       	old = rcu_dereference(tsk->signal->session_keyring);
       	rcu_assign_pointer(tsk->signal->session_keyring, keyring);
       	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tsk->sighand->siglock, flags);
is unnecessary?
If so, I think you are right since the pointer is only changed with the
siglock held[*], and so modify/modify conflict isn't a problem and doesn't
need memory barriers.
[*] Apart from during the exit() cleanup, when I don't think this should be a
problem anyway.
