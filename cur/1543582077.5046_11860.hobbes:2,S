We have a problem here that make the filesystem crash during big files
transfer (>1M). It only happens with kernel 2.4.x ; with 2.2.18, it is
very stable and fast.
I have seen a thread some time ago concerning such problem but is there
a solution against it now ?
I should add that the behaviour of serveraid under 2.4 is somehow
strange : during fsck for instance, it seems to get stuck and won't go
further if we don't strike a key on the keyboard.
