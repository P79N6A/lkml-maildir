Where the Kconfig is vs. where the menu appears are 2 different things 
though.  The latest kernel has our own Kconfig in fs/xfs, and fs/Kconfig 
just does:
source "fs/xfs/Kconfig"
This does facilitate swapping in a devel version of fs/xfs via a 
symlink, etc.
However, fs/xfs/Kconfig does still start with
menu "XFS support"
which puts it in a submenu, unlike every other fs.
I have no problem with removing the submenu.
