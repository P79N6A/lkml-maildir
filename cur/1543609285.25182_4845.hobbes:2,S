Linus has been "wrong" before.  It will require good code and numbers
backing that codes "goodness" before Linus will begin to listen.  Yes,
a new procfs format will break a great deal of userland toys, so the
changes had better be worth it and sufficient to never, EVER require
a complete overhaul in the future.
