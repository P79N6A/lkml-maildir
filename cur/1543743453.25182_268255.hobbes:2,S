hm,
still no sound with snd_ens1371 but now i spend some time to find out how
to revert a patch with bk. while compiling is still ongoing, let me tell
you how i tried to revert the patch with bk, because i am not entirely
sure if i do the right thing here:
bk changes > ../changes-04-11-2004.txt
as written before, i suspect (!) two changes here:
> [...]
> <rddunlap@osdl.org>
>     [PATCH] i386/io_apic init section fixups
> 
> <wli@holomorphy.com>
>     [PATCH] vm: convert users of remap_page_range() under sound/ to
>     use remap_pfn_range()
> [...]
> 
> so i'll revert the patches and see what it gives.
in ../changes-04-11-2004.txt i found out the ChnageSet numbers:
1.1988.72.76 + 1.2000.5.77. then i did
bk undo -a1.1988.72.76
only to find out that i misread the manual and 1.1988.72.76 is still in
place. i did
bk changes > ../changes-1.1988.72.76.txt
and the very patch has a different ChangeSet now: 1.2202. so i did
bk undo -a1.2201
is this the right way to revert patches when subsequent patches might not
allow to simply "bk undo -r<vers>" (because subsequent patches rely on
this single ChangeSet).
thank you for your assistance,
Christian
