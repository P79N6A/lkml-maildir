Proper email threading is important for web ML archives
too...
How does the attached read to a native english speaker ?
Suggestions to put that elsewhere, or better phrasing...
Or maybe, as per akpm's tpp document suggest, this
introductory emails should be forbidden^wdiscouraged,
and the text properly dispatched in the apropriate
changelogs ?
P.S.: I'm not subscribed, and couldn't find a way to do a
proper reply to Arjan's message, so, sorry to break the
proposed rule myself...
