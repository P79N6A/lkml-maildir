Red Hat "pushes" exactly what the Linux community supports:
This is also called "tracking upstream" and/or "working with the Linux
community, and following the Linux community's decisions."  This is
_not_ a political situation at all.  We simply ship what the community
supports.  Red Hat would not be good "open source citizens" if they did
otherwise.
Taking off my Red hat, and donning my "personal opinion" hat, I think
the kernel cardbus support has been very effectively.  It allows drivers
such as tulip and 8139too and epic100 and 3c59x to Just Work(tm),
without any modification besides PCI id table updates.  Nothing external
required.  That's a huge boon to programmers and maintainers.
