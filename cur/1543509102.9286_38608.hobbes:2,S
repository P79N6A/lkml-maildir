Ok, I solved it...
Suggesting the tunl0 device was very helpful, thanks Ted.  It didn't solve it
alone but led me to a solution.
The kernel patch below would not stop the problem with loopback, but it did stop
it with tunl0...
Somehow loopback manages not to really have IFF_NOARP set while tunl0 does
automatically (or some problem that looks similar).
With a tunl0 alias and this patch, if you run arpwatch and also "tail -f
/var/log/messages" you will see the kernel attempt to arp_send the tunl0
interface/ip addresses but the patch catches it and complains.
Oddly, the version of ifconfig I'm using, (net-tools 1.51,ifconfig 1.39
(1999-03-18)) doesn't allow -arp on tunl0 (it has it naturally apparently) but
does allow it on lo, where it doesn't really work (or showup in ifconfig's).
This patch is not permanent but should be applied until the real problem is found
in loopback's processing in the kernel.
