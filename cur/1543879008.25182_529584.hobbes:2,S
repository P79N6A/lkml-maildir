Yes :P What I was trying to say before jumping on a plane is that
sys_futex/sys_futex64 calls should each check their own address alignment, so
the deeper parts of the call stack always know alignment is correct.
This will remove all the fsize you pass around, and also sanitise the userspace
argument much higher in the call stack, which is very preferable and more
conventional.
Maybe this isn't possible (it's very obvious, so there may be a good reason it
hasn't been done).
