Why invent Yet-Another-Call-To-Userland-Interface when either
hotplug/dbus, netlink or an ACPI event will do?
The argument "well what if hotplug of acpid don't know what to do" is,
IMO, bogus since:
* Obviously systems today are functioning 
* Hardware will poweroff off on overheat anyway (not graceful, but will
save hardware components)
* Teaching hotplug/apcid isn't hard
* Policy should be kept out of the kernel if at all possible
