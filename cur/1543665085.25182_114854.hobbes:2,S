   Hello,
   Trying  out  the  2.5.64  kernel  to try to solve some IDE specific
   problems  with 2.4.x kernels. Now I have another problem. We have a
   Windows LAN and a Windows XP with WinRoute Pro as gateway.
   When  booting  the linux-machine with the 2.5.64 kernel the windows
   machine goes to 100% cpu and the switch (Dlink) goes crazy (loosing
   link, other machines get 100k/s instead of 10-12MiB/s etc).
   I  compiled  the  2.5.64  with  as  few  options  as  possible,  no
   netfilter, or IPSec or similar stuff.
   What can be the problem?
