Hi Stelian,
Several of these changes expose module parameters to sysfs
(i.e., have permissions of non-zero value) without need for that IMO.
This came up yesterday on the kernel-janitors mailing list.
When asked about it, Greg KH replied:

"When it makes sense to have it exposed to userspace"
Yeah, it's vague, sorry, but it all depends.
For things that can be changed on the fly, expose it.
For things that don't really matter, and no one will ever look them up,
don't.  I think the irq stuff is in the "don't" category, as almost no
one messes with them anymore.

OTOH, debug flags are often read/write and visible, so using
0644 for them is the right thing to do.
