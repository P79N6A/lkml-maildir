If you care at all about it being easy to guess, then why bother with 
the crappy PRNG?  :)
If you _don't_ care about the numbers being easy to guess -- i.e. you 
simply want unique values -- then it doesn't seem like a PRNG is needed 
at all.  With a random number you have to deal with collisions between 
nodes choosing the same number coincidentally _anyway_, so why not just 
use sequence numbers?

Let's see what pans out...  It sounds like the random driver has 
untapped performance potential, and could be made more SMP-friendly...
FWIW, for h/w RNGs, I prefer the model where a userspace daemon feeds 
the kernel entropy pool.  On most days, you will have full entropy 
buffers because 'xstore' generates random data much faster than most 
apps consume it.  But the userspace daemon can also throttle (nice to 
PM), validate the h/w RNG (ugly and costly to do in-kernel), and utilize 
a few processor-dependent features that increase xstore's throughput in 
userspace.
Then the problem simply becomes one of making sure you can copy entropy 
out of kernel memory buffers efficiently.
