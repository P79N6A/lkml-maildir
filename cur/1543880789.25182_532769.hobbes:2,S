Hi Giuseppe,
could you please send me the product ID of the hardware in question? (you 
could get it for example by running lsusb). Currently the usbhid driver 
blacklists just product ids 0x0004 and 0x0008 (so that for these product 
ids, the HID driver doesn't claim the device and lets other driver - 
acecad - to claim it). I guess you have some newer version of the device, 
so just adding it to blacklist should suffice.
Thanks,
