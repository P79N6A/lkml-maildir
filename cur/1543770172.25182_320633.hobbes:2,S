I would take that bet double or nothing.

Hopefully they will also set the config options correctly :)

I suppose the audio guys have something on that. 
Even if you don't have an ear for music, you can hear a 
skip on a CD, a scratch on a record, or a glitch on
a digital audio file from preemption latency.
These are all events in the same time frame, and
that is in the milliseconds....

And that's why we have been testing and benchmarking, to
produce number sets that supersede faith, belief, and 
conjecture. But ultimately, you can trust your senses,
and I think the audio / video test would allow your eyes 
to see, and your ears to hear the difference.

I am definitely for breaking out an IRQ threads patch,
separate from the RT-mutex patches, even if just to
allow examination of that code without the clutter.
