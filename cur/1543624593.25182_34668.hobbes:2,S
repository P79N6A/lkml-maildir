3) I think one of us is misunderstanding (its probably me)
What I was proposing was a relative wall clock time, vs application virtual 
time. 
interface would be to always specify in futex how long to wait (relative) and 
not until when to wait (absolute).
What I propose is not to export jiffies (ofcourse not), but either usecs or 
msecs and whether one should state what the minimum wait time is.
Right now we know it can't be less then 10ms (x86) unless we busywait and
above that the granularity will be in 10ms increments.
So from the previous post of code example, one has to add the conversion from
timeout to timeout_jiffies.
Also we need to determine the best API for this. Somebody (Rusty ?) suggest to
pass a pointer to (struct timeval) vs a single counter. Only disadvantage is 
an additional copy_from_user, but it gives much bigger timeouts.
I think its a good idea to add it.
