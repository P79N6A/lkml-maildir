the point I am trying to make here is that there is no reason that the 
kexec approach needs to do _any_ suspend/resume calls.
all that is needed is the ability of the new kernel to initialize the 
devices it needs.
suspend-to-disk-and-ram could be implemented as three 
seperate steps
1. suspend-to-disk
2. resume-from-disk
3. suspend-to-ram
followed by either
4. resume-from-ram
or
4. battery dies and loptop powers off completely
5. power-on boot.
6. resume-from-disk
all that you need to do is to make sure that the system doesn't run 
anything that would affect permanent media or the outside world between 
steps #2 and #3
yes it's more steps, but each step is logicly seperate, and each step will 
be excercised on a regular basis, so the combination of the steps will 
also be reliable.
this is far better then creating yet another way to pause the system that 
only a few people will use.
