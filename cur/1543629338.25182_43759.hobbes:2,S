hello everyone !
we have created a new mailing list for linux audio announcements. 
it is moderated, and will be low-volume. 
typical announcements might be:
 * releases of audio applications or new drivers
 * releases of documentation
 * latency or scheduling-related kernel patches
 * conferences, events, meetings related to linux audio
 * job advertisements (don't laugh, we've had a few on
    linux-audio-dev)
the list will be advertised to editors of major linux news sites and
printed publications, so that they have an easy, centralized news
feed and you can reach a wide audience with your announcements.
to make this work, please copy all major release announcements and
other appropriate messages to this new list. (by "major" i mean
tarball releases, as opposed to daily cvs commits. ;)
the address is 	
	linux-audio-announce@music.columbia.edu
you do not need to be subscribed to be able to post. 
no discussions should take place on the list. if you want to
encourage public feedback, please cc: an appropriate other audio
forum, such as linux-audio-user@music.columbia.edu.
please visit

 for
further information.
best,
jörn
please direct replies to my private address to keep the noise on the
