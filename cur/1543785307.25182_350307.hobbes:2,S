Hi Jeff,
Nice of you to finally join us.
I'm sure you've looked at the SAS code.  If SW/Broadcom has the same
open transport architecture, as we do, as you say they do, then you
should have no problem generating 4 events (link up/down, BYTES_DMAED,
BROADCAST(x)) to plug right into the SAS Layer, and have it do port
management, discovery, expander configuration, etc, for you.
Please let me know how it goes.  I'm very curious.
If there's any concerns with the SAS Layer, I'm willing to help
in anywhich way I can.
	Luben
