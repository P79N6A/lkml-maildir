Yeah I noticed.

Haven't even tried TCQ yet, the above is just plain dma (no travelstarts
can do tcq).

Not exactly, let me see if I remember the race here... The queue can
become plugged when we queue one request with the drive (the only on the
queue at that time), and then try to queue another right after (hence
only a tcq issue). In that time period, we drop the queue lock, so it's
indeed possible for the block layer to plug the queue before we reach
the above code again. The drive can be in two states here, 1) IDE_DMA is
set because the drive didn't release the bus (or it did, and it already
reconnected), or 2) drive is disconnected from the bus.
For non-tcq, hitting IDE_DMA set queue_commands() is a bug. The old
IDE_BUSY/IDE_DMA worked because IDE_DMA must not be set if IDE_BUSY is
not set.

Smells like new breakage to me :-)
