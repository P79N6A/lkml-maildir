The very question that's kept me up late some nights :)
And one of the reasons for spending so much time in integrating 
mcore seamlessly into the lkcd framework rather than plug it in 
as is at a high level. Precisely to avoid bloat while retaining 
flexibility and to move from something that works today to
more improved schemes in the future. 
The decision on what dump device implementations - block, net,
memory, and other special types to include could be a separate 
one from the base dump system, and could change as time passes.

The dump driver interface is pretty simple, if you look at it
.. though it was meant to be powerful enough to do a lot of nice
things in the future.
