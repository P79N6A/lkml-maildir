Preemption?
Scheduling doesn't guarantee making any specific amount of progress within 
the kernel with preemption enabled.  I thought the preferred strategy was to 
wait for the time slices to refill and then exhaust (since everybody has to 
exhaust their time slices before anybody gets new ones.  Unless I've missed 
something...?)
