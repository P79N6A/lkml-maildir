 Hi, all.
 I've got a very similar messages from my systems.
 Now I'm using LG CDROM, CRD-8400B model. This is 40x CDROM.
 The error messages on kernel 2.2.12 is following
    hda: ST310232A, 9768MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=1245/255/63, UDMA(33)
    hdb: status error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
    hdb: status error: error=0xb4
    hdb: ATAPI 40X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache, DMA
    Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.56
 Also, the following messages is revealed 
	VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
	VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
	VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
 The configuration was fine in kernel 2.2.9 .
 However, after upgrading kernel the error was occured.
 
 Anyone have solved this problem?
 Thanks
