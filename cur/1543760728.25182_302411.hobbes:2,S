It's true. You will get stats emails like this very soon 
Quickly, send me an email or call me and you will get real com.miss.ion 
emails with this subject line and big, big comm_ission pa.yments from all
the bus_inesses you 
pro_mote. 
To pro.ve it, for a limit_ed per_iod I will give.you 10 sign_ups (that will
p.a.y. to j.o.i.n. your bus.in.ess) and I will not ask you for a sin.gle
cent/penny 
to get you star-ted. Use these to gen_erate an in.stant in.com_e. 
Then sitback & watch the_sign_ups join_you inst_antly in their droves and 
without you having to do much_at all. 
At the end of March you will get comm_ission state_ments showing that you 
have ear.ned tens_of thou_s_ands of doll_ars from your existing
