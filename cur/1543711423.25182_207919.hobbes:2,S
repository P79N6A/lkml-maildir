The code you wrote, or my patch?

Sounds like a good idea.  We certainly shouldn't be passing huge masks
on the stack, but for small masks like, i dunno, <= 4 ULs (the same
optimization Bill's code makes) it's no problem.
The thing about code specific to node and cpu masks is that we *know*
what the masks we're manipulating are used for, and that lets us do
things like not letting callers set bits other than 0 on UP cpumasks, or
throwing a BUG when they do.  Or optimizing first_node() to be smarter
than just calling find_first_set() on the passed in mask by just
checking whether bit 0 is set.
