Hi Kenneth,
  I'll fix these two - but fortunately they are no problem even now.
Although outl is defined as 'int', it is compared against
'user.object_name_len', which is 'size_t' (which is unsigned int),
so whole comparsion is done unsigned and not signed. Thanks
for spotting anyway, there is no reason why it should not be
size_t.

P.S.: And report about drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_crtc2:535
is completely innocent - it passes these three mentioned
ioctl types down to first head's ioctl handler (and it is
not sisfb_ioctl, definitely... usually it is matroxfb_ioctl
from matroxfb_base.c).
