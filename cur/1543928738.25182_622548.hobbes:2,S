Sophos are interested in doing so, and we have spoken about this several
times recently over the phone. This is why they sent the email in
question yesterday, to kickstart debate. And that's awesome. I am trying
to bring a few of these folks together at the moment, so that we can get
a solution that is acceptable to upstream at some point in the future.
So, rather than criticise their current code, or their intentions, or
blanketly dismiss the virus protection market, perhaps we can focus
instead on the fact that there is a known third party who wishes to
perform a task that is not well supportable at this moment. We can all
agree the syscall table hacking isn't such a good idea - but these guys
are *very* open to listening to useful alternative suggestions.
They (virus protection folks) generally think they want to intercept
various system calls, such as open() and block until they have performed
a scan operation on the file. I explained the mmap issue to several of
these companies recently, in quite some detail, and I know they are
interested in listening this time around :-) At the end of the day, what
I have been lead to believe is that they don't care whether they
intercept syscall entries, or use a better method, they just want to
scan files and take some action if a file is "bad". That's it really.
I have been trying to put together an exact feature set that is needed
from these different vendors, so we can discuss it further here, and
hopefully actually get somewhere, too. There have been a few delays
after I pointed out the mmap issues at some length.
Jon.
