Hi,
	In 2.6.2, I noticed that my modprobe.conf line for tuner "options tuner
type=2" no longer worked. It even failed with insmod "insmod tuner.ko
type=2". dmesg reported
vmunix: tuner: chip found @ 0xc0
vmunix: tuner: type set to 19 (Temic PAL* auto (4006 FN5))
vmunix: tuner: type forced to 19 (Temic PAL* auto (4006 FN5)) [insmod]
I noticed that the a line had been removed from 2.6.1 and when it is
added everything works again. patch attached
