The original version has more operations on every timer interrupt. Also
changing the spinlock to an atomic eliminates the possibility of
contention in the timer interrupt ..

You could reduce the code in the interrupt handler (which is good), but
I think you'll end up with a polling model regardless.. If you add some
locking between the interrupt handler and something else you may as well
add the run time of that new critical section to the timer latency . So
I'm not sure it would be a outright win ..
