And why is that a problem?  The intention of this code is to make sure 
at least one busiest_best_prio task doesn't get moved as a result of the 
"skip for reasons of load weight" mechanism being overridden by the "idx 
< this_best_prio" exception.  I can't see how this intention is being 
subverted.
