Aren't you the guy that announced the "convert 1,000,000 NetWare Servers 
to Linux" contest quite a while ago? I think I should go, find and
repost this "announcement". Weren't there even prices announced?
You first tried to "get the life blood" from Novell and now refocus to
"stop the flow of blood"? What is this? Propaganda or sensible company
politics?
Maybe you _should_ stop drinking and posting.
