s390 also does hugepages at the pmd level, so it's not only x86. And
while it's not an issue today, it's worth noting that ARM also has the
same characteristics for larger sizes. Should someone feel compelled to
implement hugepages there, this will almost certainly come up again -- at
least in so far as pmd_huge() is concerned.
At a quick glance, sparc64 also looks like it might need some special
handling in the pagemap case, too..
