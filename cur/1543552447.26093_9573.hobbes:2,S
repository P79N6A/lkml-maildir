Subject: [PATCH] 2.2/2.4 ESS Maestro 2E frequency fix(?)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed that, on my new Dell Inspiron 5000e, music just didn't *sound*
right - it sounded like it was a little bit slow. This didn't happen under
Windows, and it didn't happen with CDs either.
So, after a few minutes of hacking, I ended up with the patch at the end of
this email, which seems to fix my problem.  I don't really understand the
logic behind either number, but 49152000 sure sounds a *LOT* better on my
Dell. The patch is against Red Hat's 2.2.16-22, but it should apply to any
recent 2.2 or 2.4 kernel.
I'd appreciate it if a few other people with Maestro 2E's could try my
patch and see if it makes the sound play properly or if it breaks things
and makes sound play too fast. (For the sake of completeness, the sound
files that I tested with were 44100Hz.)
