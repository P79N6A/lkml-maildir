Hi all,
I have a device driver that compiles fine on the uni-processor
environment. 
INCDIR=/usr/src/linux-2.4/include.
I was trying to compile the same module in SMP machine with -D__SMP__
-DCONFIG_SMP flags extra for CFLAGS
in the Makefile, but I end up with compilation error! Following is the
error..
In file Included from /usr/src/linux-2.4/include/asm/hw_irq.h In
function x86_do_profile:
         Current undeclared.
I included linux/interrupt.h in my source file.
What could be the problem? Are there some other flags I should use for
compilation in SMP machine?
Any pointers on this would be of great help!
Thanks in advance
Chandu!
