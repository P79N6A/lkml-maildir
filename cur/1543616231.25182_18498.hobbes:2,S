Subject: Question about bi-directional pipes.

I was just wondering if it is possible under Linux to use popen in a
bi-directional way? I want to use popen under php and must write _and_
read from and to the pipe. Some guy at the php mailing list stated that
this is possible to do with BSD, he wasn't sure about linux.
If this is a kernel issue and not a glibc one, is there a way to get
popen work bi-directionally under linux? Say I want a 
pipe = popen ('somefile', 'w+');
return a valid pipe. As it is now, popen (at least under php, but I
think this should be the same), does not return a handle for mode 'w+'.
It does return a handle only for modes 'r' and 'w'.
Regards,
;Martin
