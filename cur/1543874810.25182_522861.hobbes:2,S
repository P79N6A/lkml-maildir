We agree with this and please give us sometime to try to push our
patches to the mainline tree. We still have tons of code should be
submitted to mainline, and before the submission, the code should be
reviewed and fixed. This is my main task and I think this internal
review can reduce you and other kernel maintainer's effort.
But our team still have release pressure from customers. The whole
distribution including bootloader/toolchain/kernel/uClinux-dist should
be delivered to customers on time. If our kernel blackfin-arch are
merged eventually, we definitely will move to linus tree and ask our
customer to use linus mainline tree.
As you know, our latest U-Boot blackfin code is accepted by U-Boot
upstream mainline recently. Then the internal U-Boot SVN tree will be
replaced by upstream git-blackfin tree in U-Boot, our development will
move to that mainline tree.
At this moment, I will try my best to speed up the blackfin-arch and
drivers merge progress.

Apologise. I will resend the blackfin update patch based on other
patches.
Thanks Andrew
