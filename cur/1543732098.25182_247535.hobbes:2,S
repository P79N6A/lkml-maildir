The user/kernel distinction is not always (heck, maybe almost never)
present in the embedded world (a large world). The notion of a "regular
user" does not apply at all in such a case. This is not a bug but merely
the state of technology. It will slowly go away I think because embedded
software becomes more complex and hardware becomes cheaper.
To implement multiple TCP clients _and_ the TCP/IP stack in one space is
perfectly possible and it's actually done in practice. It has advantages
(speed, when done properly) and disadvantages (complexity/bug-prone).

There is nothing in the networking or UNIX standards that prescibe another
protection domain for this. Would be insane to leave that out in a hosted
environment but it _can_ be done without.
