Subject: [PATCH 9/9] V4L/DVB (5023): Fix compilation on ppc32 architecture
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/15/146

From: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>
There's a problem, pointed by Meelis Roos <mroos@linux.ee>, that, on ppc32 arch,
with some gcc versions (noticed with prerelease 4.1.2 20061115), compilation 
fails, due the lack of __ucmpdi2 to do the required 64-bit comparision.
This patch takes some sugestions made by Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>,
Stelian Pop <stelian@popies.net> and Segher Boessenkool <segher@kernel.crashing.org>
Signed-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>
