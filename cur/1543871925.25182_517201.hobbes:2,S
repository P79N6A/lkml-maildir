Yeah, I'm not at all surprised. Any implementation of "prefetch" that 
doesn't just turn into a no-op if the TLB entry doesn't exist (which makes 
them weaker for *actual* prefetching) will generally have a hard time with 
a NULL pointer. Exactly because it will try to do a totally unnecessary 
TLB fill - and since most CPU's will not cache negative TLB entries, that 
unnecessary TLB fill will be done over and over and over again..
In general, using software prefetching is just a stupid idea, unless
 - the prefetch really is very strict (ie for a linked list you do exactly 
   the above kinds of things to make sure that you don't try to prefetch 
   the non-existent end entry)
AND
 - the CPU is stupid (in-order in particular).
I think Intel even suggests in their optimization manuals to *not* do 
software prefetching, because hw can usually simply do better without it.
