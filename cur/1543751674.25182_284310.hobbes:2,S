I hope by "0" you're referring to a Linux kernel defined
software value and _not_ what the HW or BIOS conjured up!
Case in point: I was involved a while ago in tracking down
and fixing a local APIC enumeration bug in the x86-32 (i386)
kernel code, where the kernel failed miserably on some
dual K7 boxes because (a) only one CPU socket was populated,
(b) the BIOS assigned that CPU a non-zero ID, and (c) the
kernel (apic.c) had a bug which triggered when BSP ID != 0.
Never trust a BIOS to DTRT.
