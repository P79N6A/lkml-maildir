I had the exact same problem.  I ended up getting around it by
installing a Linux image from another machine.  2.2.18 works fine on the
machine, but Red Hat 6.2's install would not reliably get past the
infinite reset stage.
So, there is hope that once you get something new enough on the machine
you'll be in business.  You ought to be able to copy your working
IDE disk image to the SCSI disk, and with a new enough kernel boot the
SCSI disk.
