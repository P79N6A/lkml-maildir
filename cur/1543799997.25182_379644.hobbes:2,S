What is the server software? vsftpd, ProFTPD, wuftp, whatever

#-2 Check if the user the server is running (do _NOT_ tell me it is running as root!) can write to
the directory
#-1 Look into the logs of the server.
#0 Read your server software FAQ.
#1 RTFM: Read your server software manual.
#2 turn on debugging and possibly keep it in foreground (do not daemonize it), increase debug
level/verbosity
#3 if still not clear try running an `strace -f -e open SERVER_COMMAND_HERE`
#4 still here? try `strace -f SERVER_COMMAND_HERE`
#5 `man strace`
#6 use a debugger like gdb
#F Hire a professional consultant to solve your particular problem :-)
I bet you will be up and running befre going on the positive numbers :-) Above level #4 you need
good programming/debugging skills which you are not likely to have based on your question.

Yes, you are very right.
And BTW, this list is for linux kernel not for linux in general (as your question is). I should have
ignored you, but I am in "Reply" mode now :-)
Good luck!
Kalin.
