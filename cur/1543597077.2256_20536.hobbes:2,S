It is a bug. np->rx_ring[i].next_desc is initialized by 2.4.6 with
gcc-2.95.1 to
[0]: 0x...210
[1]: 0x00000000
[2]: 0x...220
[3]: 0x...230
[4]: 0x...240.
etc.

Correct. The problem was introduce by the virt_to_desc to pci_dma
conversion.

It's possible that some locking outside of the tx and rx codepath is not
required, I'm concentrating on a race free suspend & resume
implementation.
It shouldn't affect the critical functions:
rx interrupts run without a spinlock, and start_tx only acquires the
lock around "status = DescOwn;np->cur_rx++". netdev_tx_done() during
start_tx is an idea for tx interrupt mitigation, it's not yet finished.
