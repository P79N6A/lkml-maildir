One has to add appropriate calls to usb_autopm_get_interface() and
usb_autopm_put_interface(), or equally well, to usb_autopm_enable() and
usb_autopm_disable().  One might also need to set
intf->needs_remote_wakeup to 1 in the probe routine.

They would use less power if the UHCI host controller were suspended.  
But obviously it cannot be suspended while devices attached to it (such as
the USB keyboard and the appletouch device) remain active.
