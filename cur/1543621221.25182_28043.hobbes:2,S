Why not one value per file, as has been proposed often here.
You could have /proc/sys/cpu/0/processor
               /proc/sys/cpu/0/vendor_id
               /proc/sys/cpu/0/family
... and a /proc/sys/cpu/0/.table that when read produces
processor=0
vendor_id=GenuineIntel
family=6
.. so you have the best of both worlds. And you could support a
sysctl() system call that reads out the same value *in binary*
so you don't need the printf() -> sscanf() conversion.
The current sysctl_args struct does need an extra "oldtype" and "newtype"
value in there, which could be set to SYSCTL_TYPE_IP, SYSCTL_TYPE_INT4,
SYSCTL_TYPE_STRING, etc and which could be ORed with SYSCTL_FMT_ASCII
or SYSCTL_FMT_BINARY
sysctl also needs a way to get an entire tree (the .table entry)
in just one call.
So I advocate having /proc and sysctl() being just 2 ways to access
the same namespace, having one value per file, and having a way
to read a entire tree or directory at once.
Mike.
