Reverting for now sounds like the right thing to me.  I would like to
understand what's going on, though.
For the serial console to work early, serial8250_console_setup() must
be returning zero.  So we can't be taking this return:
	if (!port->ops)
		return -ENODEV;
and therefore, the hunk in serial_core.c shouldn't have any effect either.
So is it merely the fact that we call serial8250_late_console_init()?
I wouldn't expect that to make any difference, because the setup()
call from serial8250_console_init() should have succeeded, so
CON_ENABLED should have been set, and we don't do anything in
that case.
Keith, can you tell me how to reproduce this?
