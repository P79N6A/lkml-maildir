Not a problem. Autoconfiguration is made to help configuring
the kernel, before to compile it. So you need a linux working
machine (actually you can cross-compile).
Our task is to allow user to compile a kernel, with the
needed drivers, without the non used drivers.
If you want a good running kernel image:
   check the kernels in your distribution.
If you want to compile a general running kernel:
   use the kernel sources in your distribution (
   with your distribution's .config), or compile
   the std kernel with your distribution's .config
If you want a working kernel to boot Linux in your
   old/new/non-x86 machine: check the installation
   note of your distribution. Use special kernel (from
   your distribution,...)
You see: different task needs different tools.
Maybe we can merge some problems, but how? why?
[I still have a working version of autoconfigure in
shell, if some "boot-floppies" people need some
of our detection.]
But for old ISA cards (and some newer laptop) there is
only one method to find the right *kernel*:
boot and try (and changing kernels, parameters,...)
[check: installation document and internet resources].
We don't want a boot and retry for our configuration,
so let use the (incomplete) infos from kernel.
