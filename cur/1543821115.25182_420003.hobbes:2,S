Now this is horribly broken and would explain why things go south. I
guess the chip needs a reset early in the detection sequence to function
properly. Try putting:
    sdhci_reset(host, SDHCI_RESET_ALL);
just before the driver does a readl() on the capabilities register (in
sdhci_probe_slot()).

That's just probably a broken ACPI. Laptops tend to be buggy as hell.
File a report with the ACPI guys.
