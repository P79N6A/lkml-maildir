I like it. The messages are short enough so we should not get line wraps
and it makes stuff more clear. You know, the context is not familiar to
everyone, just imagine the "why do we {suspend,resume} devices during
{resume,suspend} questions.
Also, i can ask for "send me output of dmesg|grep ^swsusp" to avoid
newbies flooding me with totally irrelevant info ;-)
