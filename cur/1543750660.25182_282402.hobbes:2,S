This is not optimism. This is experience. Every ``stable'' kernel I've
seen is a pile of incredibly stale code where vi'ing any file in it
instantly reveals numerous months or years old bugs fixed upstream.
What is gained in terms of reducing the risk of regressions is more
than lost by the loss of critical examination and by a long longshot.
