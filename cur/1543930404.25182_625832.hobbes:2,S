Of course, I don't know the problem enough, and would be glad if somebody
give me a hint, but I wonder why so deep nesting with lockdep's modification
is necessary here? Does buses have parent buses and so on x8? Why isn't
here considered creating of different lockdep classes according to types
of buses and devices "the usual way"? This way seems to be quite easy in
later debugging.
