Alas, you can't.  If accessing quantities of type short is exceptionally
slow, then it may well be that the ABI decress Thou Shalt Pad.  gcc has
__attribute__(packed) to allow you to work around this.
Just do as the plan9'ers do and represent all externally visible data
as an array of unsigned chars.  It's difficult to get that wrong.
