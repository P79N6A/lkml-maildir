However, as i understand it this could only apply to *future* releases 
of the library. The versions already released under LGPL would remain
under the LGPL. 
If people for political reasons find this unacceptable, they are free
to fork off development using the last LGPL'ed library as a basis for
future revisions of an LGPL'ed glibc.
