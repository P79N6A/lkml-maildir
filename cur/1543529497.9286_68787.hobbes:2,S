Hi,
can someone please explain me what goes wrong when I 
receive the message :
  stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#x)
on a SMP machine ?
I assume there is an error in the driver I wrote (eicon isdn driver), which
causes this message and after some time a complete hang.
I cannot reproduce this error with my machine.
Can anybody give me a hint where to look ?
Thanks,
Armin
