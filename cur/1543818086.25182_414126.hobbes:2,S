The problem ist the word 'the'. If parent and child are using 'the foo',
they will clash.

bin/foo calls bin/bar refering to /proc/self/fd/999
bin_2/bar does dup2(open(get_my_exedir()), 999)  ***FUBAR***
possible solution:
don't dup2, and only close fds you opened yourself.
Disadvantage: Leaky (too), may break scripts.
.oO(Can you chroot a single filedescriptor or somehow make 
    /proc/self/fd/$n/.. be unavailable?)

There may be no "real path" corresponding to /proc/self/fd/4711.
IMO it's still best to just symlink the program directory to the correct 
place and make the programs search in e.g. ~/opt/ and /opt/.
