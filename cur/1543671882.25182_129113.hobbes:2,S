This is funny.  Patching with "patch -p0 < 2.5.68-mm3" caused all the patched 
files to appear in /usr/src/25  They also disappeared from 
/usr/src/linux-2.5.68
I did "cp -a /usr/src/25/* /usr/src/linux-2.5.68/" and there was no error at 
first, but the compile failed with:
gcc -Wp,-MD,net/core/.netfilter.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall 
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe 
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -Iinclude/asm-i386/mach-default 
-fomit-frame-pointer -nostdinc -iwithprefix include

Still I can't understand what is the intended way of doing this.  I will try 
n+1 ways and stop to think now and then, but if someone has an easy way to do 
this, I haven't seen it.
