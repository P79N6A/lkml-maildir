thanks for forwarding this report, actually I just noticed this here and
that's good so I can reproduce :)
it is possible it is my mistake, but I don't think so, infact I don't
recall to have changed rss stuff or locking around it. Incidentally the
first time I reproduced it here was after the tlb shootdown patch from
Ben was introduced, never reproduced it here previously with only my
changes.  However it is possibly just a coincidence.
