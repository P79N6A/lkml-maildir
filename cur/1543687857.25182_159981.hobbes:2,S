Subject: [patch 2.6] 3c509.c Fix printed dev id.

	Hi;
	Callers of el3_common_init() immeadiately then call
register_netdev() and check it for error, and on error
call release_region() on the io addr, and follow an error
path.
	As it stands, the detection prink in el3_common_init()
prints out something like:
eth%d: 3c5x9 at 0x280, BNC port, address  00 20 af 2f d4 81, IRQ 5.
   ^^
	Because the %d is filled out by register_netdev(), called
after the printk.
	This patch just moves all the register_netdev(), and the
release_region() (on error) inside of el3_common_init(), and
gives that function a return value. Now the prink will identify
the device name assigned. Behaviour on error should be
functionally unchanged.
