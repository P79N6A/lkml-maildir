No, scan_align is how much to pad each line, and it's up to the engine
to discard the padding.  In this case, the hardware does not allow
padding and must be given data in exact multiples. For example, vesafb
can accept 4x4 fonts padded to 8x4, but vga16fb will not be able to draw
4x4 fonts properly.
