On the other hand, no one would put reading of a SELinux security label 
here.  But we already have fields in binprm specifically for commoncap.  I 
have no strong preference.

Yah, they're broken anyway right now if that's what they're doing.
The reason I didn't go for something like your approach (other than not 
thinking of it) was that, as long as we're changing the semantics, we might 
as well make them as clean as possible.  I also didn't mind ripping out 
lots of old code :).  If the inheritable mask stays, then programs need to 
be audited for what happens if they are run with different inheritable 
masks.  I'd rather just eliminate that complication and the corresponding 
blob of commoncap code.  Obviously my patch fails a lot of your tests as a 
result.
So do we arm-wrestle over whose implementation wins? :)  I'd say mine wins 
on readability (not your fault -- the old code was pretty bad to begin 
with) and some simplicity, but yours has the benefit of being less intrusive.
