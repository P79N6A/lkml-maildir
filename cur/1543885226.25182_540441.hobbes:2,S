Uh, what did I miss?  Oh, I see, I need a module_param(rx_mode, int,
0600) or something?  Or maybe with a callback if we can change it on the
fly?  And enum type?  Or maybe I string?
I'll sort it out.

Yeah.  The Xen ring stuff is a bit full of magic macros, so I was going
to look at inlineizing/re-namespacing it in a separate patch.

Sorry, I forgot about it.  I was waiting to hear back from network
people about what this is actually for, and whether we really need it.

It wasn't obvious to me whether this meant that we could avoid having a
netfront-private carrier flag but still get quick response by using
"netif_carrier_on(); dev_activate();".
