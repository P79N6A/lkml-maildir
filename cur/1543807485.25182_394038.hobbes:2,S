Quoting David Brownell (david-b@pacbell.net):

I already wrote that I had commented out the line that caused the
hangup:
//			pci_write_config_byte(pdev, offset + 3, 1);
After commenting out this line, the machine boots OK and EHCI works
fine. It does print the BIOS handoff failed message. 
If I do not comment out the above line, the machine hangs, and,
obviously, no BIOS handoff failed message is printed.
