Why?  If the fs doesn't set PG_private or PG_fscache on any pages before
calling read_cache_pages(), there's no difference.
Furthermore, the differences only crop up in the error handling paths.

Which helps how?

Well, I could give an alternative read_cache_pages(), I suppose, for just this
situation, but that means there are two parallel functions which then both
need to be maintained.
