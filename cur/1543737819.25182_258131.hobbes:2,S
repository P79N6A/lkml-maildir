One problem is that `console' means multiple things:
  1. The output device for printk() (multiple consoles are allowed, cfr.
     multiple console= kernel parameters and debug-only consoles)
  2. The tty (both input and output) for /sbin/init (only one instance, cfr.
     the last console= kernel parameter)
I suggested to change the logic for 2 not to use the last console= kernel
parameter if it turns out not to support input (cfr. the return value of struct
console.device()), but try the other registered struct consoles.

Indeed. Because the /dev/null driver doesn't call register_console().
It could be made to work that way (`console=null'), though, but make sure to
register your null-console _first_.
But I think it's simpler to just check console->device() and take appropriate
actions.

It was not `designed' to be that way. But due to how `the console' (nr. 2 from
above) works, registration order matters. If people make the mistake (or just
forget) to say `console=ttyS0', a debug console registered later causes
problems.
And the reason the debug consoles (read: capturers) use register_console() is
to avoid code duplication.
