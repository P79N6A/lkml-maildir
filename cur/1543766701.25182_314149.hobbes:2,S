Nope. That makes "data" itself (the compat-pointer, not the thing it
points to) be marked as being in user space, which is not right.

Yes. Now, when you use "compat_ptr()" on that thing, compat_ptr() will do 
the proper thing, and results in a "void __user *", so assuming you 
convert the pointer correctly, it will always end up having the right user 
annotation.
(Except on MIPS, where compat_ptr() doesn't, but MIPS hasn't been updated 
to do any sparse checking anyway).
