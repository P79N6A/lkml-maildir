Got this twice in a few weeks now:
suddenly, all regular files in a directory disappear. e2fsck finds no
errors. No trace in the logs. This is Linux 2.1.131 with the knfsd
patches, gcc 2.8.1.
Yes, it looks with certainty like a userlevel program gone awry.
However, I have unsuccessfully checked the usual suspects in all
crontabs and I want to rule out any kernel problem. Has anyone else
seen this?
