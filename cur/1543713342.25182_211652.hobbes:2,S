agreed, vmtruncate may still be very costly due the pte scan, so
I was probably wrong about not needing the semaphore anymore with
prio-tree (I was too objrmap centric, and after all objrmap with the
trylocks threats it like a spinlock anyways), though the semaphore
cannot help the latency of the non-contention case (I mean with preempt
disabled), that seem to have room for improvements with a cond_sched()
before returning from invalidate_mmap_range_list not present yet.
