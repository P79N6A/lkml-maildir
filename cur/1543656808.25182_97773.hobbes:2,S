Patched, It boots on my shiny new ASUS P4B533-VM motherboard with 
GeForce 4 TI 4200 AGP card.  Identifies the chipset properly and 
proceeds to boot fine.  X works (nvidia driver), OpenGL works.  Without 
patch, it hangs (the PCI bus I think) after AGP initialization.

I have no idea if the 830MP initialization is supposedly more compatible 
with the 845G chipset than the 845 initialization.  I just know it 
didn't work and took a guess as to what it should be.
