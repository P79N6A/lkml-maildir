I have this patch also floating around, but I've decided it isn't needed.
I believe this flag is to indicate that we have removable media for a
block device rather than to indicate that the block device can be removed.
However, when we insert and remove a MMC card, we create and destroy the
block device itself.  Therefore, as far as the block layer is concerned,
the device itself is being inserted and removed, so telling the block
layer that the media is removable is just silly - you can't separate the
flash media from the on-board MMC controller.
(Note: any block device can be removed - you just rmmod the module
supplying the block device driver, but this doesn't mean we mark all
block devices with GENHD_FL_REMOVABLE.)
