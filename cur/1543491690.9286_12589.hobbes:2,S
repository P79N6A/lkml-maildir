There were some heated discussions on the subject on this list in the
past so it is hard to say if you are "off-topic" or not. :-)
For "normal" situations I just did the following to my 'ifup':

     else
        route add -host ${IPADDR} ${DEVICE}
which is not exactly right but does the job for me.  Whatever variant
of an analogous script you are using a "guard" of that kind will prevent
double route entries.
