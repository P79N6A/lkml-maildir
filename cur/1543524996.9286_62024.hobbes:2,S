Subject: 2.3.42aa2: Hangs mounting IDE CD

P2 UP, mostly Red Hat 6.1 + binutils-2.9.5.0.24. When mounting a CD as a
user, the CD starts and the whole system hangs hard. No keyboard, no mouse,
no HDD activity (I had just started a build of an egcs snapshot). Only a
reset got it out.
Haven't tried plain 2.3.42, and won't: Plain 2.3.x's give ext2 corruption.
