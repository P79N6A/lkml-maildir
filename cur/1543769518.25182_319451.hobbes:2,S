YES, please send me your kernel config and I'd like to try this. The 
single biggest complaint we get on linubios is
- no command interface
- can't load a system from cdrom
- can't boot from arbitrary disk
- no command interface
- no command interface
- no command interface
- no command interface
- no command interface
- no command interface
- "we hate etherboot"
- "FILO does not do enough"
- "we want Open Firmware"
Oh, wait, that's more than one, but you get my drift. Please send config 
file!
I'd really like to get a kernel in there and start resolving these issues.
