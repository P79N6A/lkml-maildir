I know I shouldn't invoke this particular acronym, but I rather like 
CVS's approach. If the user does not specify any files on the command 
line, assume he wants to check in everything that has changed (added and 
removed files excluded). When you see the initial commit message you can 
review the list of affected files and you can always abort and specify 
files explictly if you realize you want to exclude some.
I like that method because it gives you a kick in the pants for having 
mixed multiple unrelated changes in your working directory. "Oh, you 
were lazy and changed six unrelated things without comitting, eh? You 
will now pay for your lack of rigor by typing filenames..." On the flip 
side, you get rewarded with less typing if you keep your working 
directory clean.
