This means we're calling into it more often than we should be.
Basically, we hit __alloc_pages() with __GFP_WAIT set, find nothing
we're allowed to touch, dive into try_to_free_pages(), fall through
scanning there, sleep in blk_congestion_wait(), wake up again, try
to shrink_slab(), find nothing there either, repeat that 11 more times,
and then fall through to out_of_memory()... and this happens at at
least 10Hz.
        since = now - lastkill;
        if (since < HZ*5)
                goto out_unlock;
try s/goto out_unlock/goto reset/ and let me know how it goes.
