I guess the real question is why do you need to wait so long?  What is it that 
needs to be done prior to this call?
On the other hand, I have a late call (I use module init) to set up the 
interrupt handler for the UART, which needs to happen after malloc is working. 
This, however, does not cause, of it self, a break.
