With reference to 2.2.9
I was writing a quick perl script to parse the MAINTAINERS file and:
  1) there is a typo on line 624, the M is missing a following colon
  2) there is no clean way to find where the actual data starts in the
     file, maybe a START: tag at the beginning of the data?
here's a quick diff against the MAINTAINERS file if anyone cares:

        Obsolete:       Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally
means
                        it has been replaced by a better system and you
                        should be using that.

NO (or Linux) is the answer.
