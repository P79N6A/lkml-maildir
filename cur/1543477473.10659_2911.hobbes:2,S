That reminds me that some stations in the countries of the eastern Europe
still broadcast in the OIRT frequency range, which is 64 - 73 MHz, below
the western CCIR range 88 - 108 MHz. Myself I think no artificial limits
should be set for the receiving frequency, and just let the hardware do what
it can.
