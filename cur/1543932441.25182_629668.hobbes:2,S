I assumed it was reserved for the pccard thing, which I don't see
listed or allocated anywhere else.

I'll try that, for grins.

I've got xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.3.0.0-36.fc8 installed.  I wouldn't
have thought that was too old, since Fedora 8 just came out, but it's
not like I keep up on these things.  I'll give 1.4.99 a try, as that's
what's current in Rawhide.

Another way to look at this is that the graphics BAR came in from
the BIOS allocated at c0000000, and we ignored that.  Perhaps there's
a way to give weight to the BIOS settings when consdering where the
PCI region is supposed to start?
On that system for which there was undeclared resources, did the BIOS
avoid that resource for the other PCI resources?  I suspect it did...
