Heres some more data:
io_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.20-rc1 [2]          1142.2  6       90      10      16.00
2420rc1r64 [3]          575.0   12      43      10      8.05
That's it then. Should I run a family of different values and if so over what 
range?
Cheers,
Con
