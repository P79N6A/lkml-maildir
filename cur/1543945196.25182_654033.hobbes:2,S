The high priority review item is that the driver performs operation
completion callbacks in hardirq context.  Clients of the API assume
that callbacks will happen in softirq context.  Of lesser concern is
the use of GFP_ATOMIC in fsl_dma_alloc_descriptor.  Other drivers
preallocate a small pool of descriptors.
