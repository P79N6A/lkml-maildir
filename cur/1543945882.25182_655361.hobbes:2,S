Linus wasn't saying you don't need a 'From:' line in this case (as the
*top* line of patches you didn't author).  He's saying it's not an
instance of the type "tag" line, such as the "Signed-off-by:" line that
go after the patch explanation.  The "From:" line is a different kind
of line, with different rules and position.
