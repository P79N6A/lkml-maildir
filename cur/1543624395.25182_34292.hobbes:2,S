+AWARD Bios Work-Around
+CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE
+  Should you have a system w/ an AWARD Bios and your drives are larger
+  than 32GB and it will not boot, one is required to perform a few OEM
+  operations first.  The option is called "STROKE" because it allows
+  one to "soft clip" the drive to work around a barrier limit.  For
+  Maxtor drives it is called "jumpon.exe".  Please search Maxtor's
+  web-site for "JUMPON.EXE".  IBM has a similar tool at:

+
+Raw Access to Media
+CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL
+  This is a direct raw access to the media.  It is a complex but
+  elegant solution to test and validate the domain of the hardware and
+  perform below the driver data recover if needed.  This is the most
+  basic form of media-forensics.
+
+  If you are unsure, say N here.
+
+Use Taskfile I/O
+CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO
+  This is the "Jewel" of the patch.  It will go away and become the new
+  driver core.  Since all the chipsets/host side hardware deal w/ their
+  exceptions in "their local code" currently, adoption of a
+  standardized data-transport is the only logical solution.
+  Additionally we packetize the requests and gain rapid performance and
+  a reduction in system latency.  Additionally by using a memory struct
+  for the commands we can redirect to a MMIO host hardware in the next
+  generation of controllers, specifically second generation Ultra133
+  and Serial ATA.
+
+  Since this is a major transition, it was deemed necessary to make the
+  driver paths buildable in separtate models.  Therefore if using this
+  option fails for your arch then we need to address the needs for that
+  arch.

+  If you want to test this functionality, say Y here.
