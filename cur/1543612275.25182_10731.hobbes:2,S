And since just about every major distribution is shipping 2.4 it makes it a little harder to use a 2.2 kernel if you get a dsitro as many are tuned to 2.4 and often don't work right with 2.2.  This actually killed my web cam somewhere around 2.4.10~13.14?

I have a patch out, and am trying to convince Marcelo to include it.  I 
*DO* know about this as I get lots of the mail complaining about it.  If 
you are suffering, please try with the patch
Marcelo, can we put the ide-floppy patch in the next 2.4.17-pre?  I'll 
happily send you the patch again.
