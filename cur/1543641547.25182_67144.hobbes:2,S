Michael's problem is drivers/net/tulip/de2104x.c and this problem is known
since several months.
There are two possible solutions:
1. make the driver hot-pluggable
2. #ifdef the .remove away
Jeff Garzik doesn't want 1. until "someone actually tells me they are
trying to hot-plug such a card" and he didn't apply the following patch to
#ifdef the .remove away if the driver is compiled statically into the
kernel:
