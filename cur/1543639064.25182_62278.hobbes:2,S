have you tried it in a 5V slot ? My DL2K nearly doesn't work at all in
3V slots: it sends hundreds of packets, and the driver needs to be unloaded
then reloaded. In a 5V slot, at least, it hangs really later :-/
At first, I thought it came from a problem with the 64bit slots, but I had
problems with this card only on 3V slots on other machines. Although it's
not a broadcom chipset, the problem may be similar.
Cheers,
Willy
