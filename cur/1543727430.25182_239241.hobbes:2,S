The attached patch adds NVIDIA SATA controller support under libata for
the 2.4 series kernel, as well as a patch to libata-core.c that
addresses the following issues.
A minor change to libata-core.c needs to accompany this patch.  This is
in regards to the function ata_pci_remove_one(), where the
host_set->ops->host_stop(host_set) needs to occur before the
iounmap(host_set->mmio_base).  This is because sata_nv's host_stop
callback needs access to the iomapped region.
In addition, in ata_pci_remove_one(), the call to
scsi_unregister_module() seems out of place, since the individual SATA
drivers are doing this in their cleanup routines.
