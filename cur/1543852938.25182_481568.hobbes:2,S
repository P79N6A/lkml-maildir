I actually agree here. Linux needs to be easier for people to use, not harder. 
Isn't there a way for bootloaders or the kernel early on figure out if the 
machine supports SMP, and if it doesnt, load a uniproc kernel instead?

Socket A CPUs are also ungodly common. They're as common as slot 1/socket 370 
Pentium 3s, and, at least with my old P3 board, trying to use APIC on UP 
caused lockups. My Duron 1ghz laptop also does the same thing. (Booting 
either with noapic fixes it).
So yeah, if distros make stupid choices like these, then we're pretty screwed.
