Note that this behavior directly leads to "convoy formation": if that
woken thread T0 does not immediately run (e.g., because there are higher
priority threads) but still already owns the mutex, then other running
threads contending for this mutex will block waiting for T0, forming a
convoy.

Looks like a good time to submit Defect Report to the Open Group.
