Sure, explain to me how I should upgrade my RH-9 system to work on my new i915?
I'm not a big fan of the DRM code either, it's ironic that I'm in a position 
where I'm defending it.  Thanks to the cleanup work Dave is doing though it is 
improving after a long period of neglect.
However, introducing a new binary interface isn't going to magically transform 
a fairly neglected codebase into a sparkly new one.  All I can really see it 
doing is saving a few K of memory in the hetrogenous dual head case.  Oh, and 
introducing a new failure mode to be debugged at a distance.
