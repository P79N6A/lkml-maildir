Subject: agpgart support for AMD 765 support broken in 2.4.20-pre4?

Hello!
   I found that I cannot boot into 2.4.20-pre4 if I have CONFIG_AGP_AMD set
   kernel's agpgart driver displays that it have found AMD-765 and 
   reboots. Next reboot into any kernel is also failed with
   APIC 08 error on CPU0 (continuously scrolled over the screen until I press
   reset).
   I have dual athlon box with Tiyan tiger motherboard.
