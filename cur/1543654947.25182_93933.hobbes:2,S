I think you should be able to call do_signal or a wrapper in some
platform-independent way.  Is the necessary information recoverable in
Alpha et al.?  What do you think of adding a standard wrapper function
so that system calls can process a signal if necessary?
Not only did George need this for POSIX conformance, I've seen a lot of
complaints about GDB interrupting sys_nanosleep even on cancelled
signals.
