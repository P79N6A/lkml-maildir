Please explain why it's necessary to export this to userspace.
The files in /usr/include/scsi are actually shipped by glibc, and most
distributions use glibc's version instead of the one from the kernel --
so this additional userspace interface is automatically incompatible
with most people's installations.
It would perhaps make sense to stop glibc providing these files, and let
distributions use the version from the kernel -- but that's a separate
issue. And still doesn't seem to justify the addition of the above
function.
