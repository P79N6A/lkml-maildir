I had one for bridge address/TIO, one for bridge address/nonTIO, one for 
soft address/TIO and one for soft address/nonTIO.
I thought that was what you were proposing. In any event, here's how the 
basic code looks (leaving out type defs/error checking/
etc) - the wrapper is embedded in the macro - note that we would always 
like to use the soft struct because it doesn't cost us a PIO
but in the event that the soft struct is not available the bridge 
address must be used:
#define SET_TYPE_AND_PTR(ptr, type, bridge) \
    if ( IS_IOADDR(ptr) ) { \
        if ( IS_TIO(ptr->id) ) \
            type = BT_TIO; \
        else \
            type = BT_PIC; \
        bridge_addr = ptr; \
    } else { \
        type = ptr->bs_bridge_type; \
        bridge_addr = ptr->bs_base; \
    }
void *
pcireg_xxx_get(void *ptr)
{
    SET_TYPE_AND_PTR(ptr, &type, bridge);
    switch (type ) {
        case BT_TIO:
            return bridge_addr->ti_xxx;
        case BT_PIC:
            return bridge->addr->pic_xxx;
        default:
            /* */
    }
}
Is this what you are suggesting ??
void *
pcireg_xxx_get(void *ptr)
{
    if ( IS_IOADDR(ptr) )
        return REAL_pcireg_xxx_get(ptr, IS_TIO(ptr) ? BT_TIO : BT_PIC);
    else
        return REAL_pcireg_xxx_get(ptr->bs_base, ptr->bs_bridge_type);
       
}
void *
REAL_pcireg_xxx_get(void *ptr, int type)
{
    switch (type ) {
        case BT_TIO:
            return bridge_addr->ti_xxx;
        case BT_PIC:
            return bridge->addr->pic_xxx;
        default:
            /* */
    }
}
