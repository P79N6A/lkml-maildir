Actually, I was thinking that each server served a different mountpoint
instead of both providing the same one.
I'm not sure how the locks currently would be provided unless the
distributed lock from the shared storage interacts with each servers statd
properly. Otherwise you will already have problems.
Second, I thought that statd didn't care about the lock requests coming
from two IP numbers. This should be no different than having two network
interfaces attached to one server (and that works under Solaris). The
client should be using the name from the IP number, not the router used
between the client and server. I view the floating IP as existing behind
a router using the real IP. Since none of the clients are using the real
IP, the naming should remain consistant (I think).

I don't know.
