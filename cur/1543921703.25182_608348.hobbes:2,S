presumably because I haven't been merging it.
I was in bugfix-only mode from a week prior to 2.6.24 release and during
the merge window.  Partly caused by the already-idiotic amount of stuff we
had queued for 2.6.24, partly because we needed to concentrate on
stabilising the 2.6.25 patchpile rather than writing new stuff.
And partly to send the signal that rather than beavering away on new
features all the time, we should also be spending some (more) time testing,
reviewing and bugfixing the current and soon-to-be-current code.
Probably I should have been more explicit about it, but it wasn't really
planned.  Next time I'll send more "thanks, I parked this for consideration
at a more appropriate time" emails.
