Hi Alan,
with the attached patch I hope to have fixed the 2.2.15pre4
VM problems. I didn't manage to break it myself, but maybe
one of the dear readers has a machine where they are able
to do so...
Please give this patch (against 2.2.15pre4) a solid beating
and report back to us. Thanks all!
regards,
Rik
