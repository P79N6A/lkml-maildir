You are almost certainly looking for a broken/crap NAT box, firewall or
similar product. Routers that are just being routers don't touch the TCP
layer so even if they are broken/crap/ancient they won't do any harm to
it.
The usual offenders are cheap NAT boxes and badly designed load
balancers. They may not even show up in a trace but you should expect
them to be at one end or the other, unless your ISP is providing you
with NATted addresses or some kind of managed security service.
