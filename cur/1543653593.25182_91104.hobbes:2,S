That is quite an impressive gain.  The patch I sent Marcelo which
also fixes up a problem with some tualatins and adds P4 trace cache
support is at..
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.4/2.4.20/descriptors.diff
As you have tualatins can you try with the above patch and make sure
theres no regressions there ?
