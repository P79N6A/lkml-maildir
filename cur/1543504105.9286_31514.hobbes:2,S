What do you mean here? Is it that most other SIMs are unaware of SCSI BUS
resets they donnot initiate (raised by another devices on the BUS) ?
I suspected guys that work on the driver for the CPU and MEMORY to have
much to learn about IOs, but I didn't think I was so right.

The way the linux scsi layer resets and retries commands if full stupid.
The fact that the device drivers (or applications for raw IOs) are not 
notified of RESETS when this condition cannot be reported by a command 
that fails does not allow any reasonnable recovery.
The recovery is to be performed by the application client (basically the
device driver) that must have some handle on events that actually happen
and involve the device.  So, all the recovery stuff that is done by the
scsi driver is exactly the wrong thing to do regarding recovery.
The mid-layer must be some kind of transparent layer when recovery is to 
be performed. Doing different is (has been) a serious design bug.
