Nothing in the driver tree should be using PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE
except drivers/pci/*. Drivers that are still manipulating ROMs
directly should be converted to use the PCI ROM API.
I started to fix these but some of the use is non-obvious. It is best
if the maintainers do it. These files are still directly manipulating
ROMs:
ide/pci/aec62xx.c
ide/pci/cmd64x.c
ide/pci/hpt34x.c
ide/pci/hpt366.c
ide/pci/pdc202xx_new.
ide/pci/pdc202xx_old.c
mtd/maps/pci.c
net/sungem.c
net/sunhme.c
scsi/qla2xxx/qla_init.c
video/console/sticore.c
video/matrox/matroxfb_misc.c
video/sis/sis_main.c
