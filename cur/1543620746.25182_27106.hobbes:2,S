WRT max size, Linus already replied why this is so. The other thing --
the callback return value was really to have it return 'done or not'
when doing partial completions. It was later decided that the end_io
callback should only be called for final completion, so really the
nr_sectors and return value is not used now. I'll clean that up next
time around.
