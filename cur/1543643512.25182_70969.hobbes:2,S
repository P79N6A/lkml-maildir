We clearly have different definitions of what is acceptable.  If your
attitude is that understanding the code is a luxury all that means is
that I want you nowhere near any code I maintain.  Non-trivial code
requires non-trivial understanding and that understanding is not a
"luxury" in my book.
If your company has such a poor business model that they can't afford to
pay you enough to take the time to do a good job then find a different
place to work.  No amount of debugger "help" is going to make up for a
lack of understanding.
Yeah, I'm up on my high horse, but this sort of stuff just infuriates me.
If you aren't going to spend the time to do the code right, which means
spending the time to *completely* understand what it is that the code is
doing, why the problem is occurring, and why the fix is a real fix and
not a bandaid, then all you are doing is creating more work for somebody
else in the future.  You are *guessing*.  Maybe your company tolerates
that but I don't have to and I sure as hell don't and I'd question
anyone or any company that does.  If you like working like that maybe
you should consider Microsoft, they seem to really value that approach.
Otherwise realize that you are straying and get back on the correct path.
