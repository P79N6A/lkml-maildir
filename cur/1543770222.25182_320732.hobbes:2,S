Hrm... in fact, It complicates life for drivers. There already a few
using it, and there are cases, like sym53c8xx_2, that do something like
	int bar = dodgy_logic_to_find_what_bar_to_use();
	foo = pci_iomap(dev, bar, pci_resource_len(dev, bar));
And in a completely different function, a simple
	pci_iounmap(dev, foo);
To pass the bar in there requires to either add a field to the driver
"instance" structure or to reproduce the "dodgy logic".
I've fixed them all, but I don't like the patch that much.
It may be simpler indeed for me to actually only complicate the ppc &
ppc64 pci_iounmap() implementation and have it compare the virtual
address against known PCI IO spaces...
Ben.
