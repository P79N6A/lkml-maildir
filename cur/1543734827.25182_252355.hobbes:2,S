It looks to me as if the eh code prevents further queuecommand()
calls while the LLD *_reset_handler() code is running.
I wonder if it also does so for the eh_strategy_handler() ?
Have to look at it, I guess.

Mmmm.. yes, that may be better, perhaps.
Whatever this driver does, it has to be reasonably portable
back to early 2.4.xx kernels, so it cannot depend too much
upon newly (or to-be) implemented semantics in 2.6.xx.
Cheers
