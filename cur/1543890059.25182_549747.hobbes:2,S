See how much confusion it all makes!
Right, it was intended -- first the long form is shown and then the
shorter one (and "long form tests help to distinguish"):
	if (p == NULL)	/* this way please */
		return 1;
	if (!p)		/* Everytime you shorten it, God kills a kitten */
		return 0;
		/* so perhaps don't do it if you love animals or
		know someone who does. */
I seem to have forgotten more comments/explanation.
