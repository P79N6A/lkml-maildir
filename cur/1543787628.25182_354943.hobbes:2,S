Same trace, pretty much like I expected. Still, starfire must be getting 
a bad skb from the upper layers, because it gets passed __unmodified__ to 
skb_checksum_help().
Either that, or skb_checksum_help() itself got broken at some point, at 
least on 64-bit platforms.
I'll try to reproduce it over the weekend (assumming I can get an x86_64 
box set up, with a starfire inside) and see where the problem is.

I'm actually surprised you got your panic from nfsd. skb_checksum_help() 
is called only when one of the fragments has length == 1, so the easiest 
way to hit it is to slowly type something into a telnet session.
Thanks,
