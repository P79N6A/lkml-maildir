Personnally, I'm used to limit all permissions to the least needed. And
particularly, no executable except shell scripts have the read permission
for others. I must say that I do this in reduced environments (less than
20 MB root image) where it improves security : when I was a student,
I found it so much useful to simply copy every shell or suid program
to disassemble them or simply try to crash them and dissect their
cores that I know I couldn't have gotten some root priviledges if at
the beginning I could not have had access to this precious information.
Also, during a security audit, I had the opportunity to abuse a web
server to retrieve application executables in which paths and IP
addresses were hard-coded. Once again, this would not have been
possible with a chmod -r.
But users should be aware that information provided under /proc/self
to those binaries is reduced. Bash does not support /dev/stdin and
friends if it is unreadable, because it replaces this with
/proc/self/fd/0 which is unreachable.
That said, I tend to agree with you. Every now and then we see
a /proc or ptrace exploit or something like this which lets you
dump the binary, so chmod -r is not the universal solution to
local attacks.
