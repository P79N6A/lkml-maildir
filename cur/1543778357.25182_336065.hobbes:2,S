Like in gnet_stats, yes. I thought you meant usages like *(u64 *)
which we shouldn't do either.

I was thinking of subscription messages over netlink itself for
the advantage that we could use it within the distributed netlink
protocol that has to come up sometime soon. Well, both ways
are ok I guess, the ease of distributive usage is my only argument.

I'm not aware of any and I agree. We don't need n<->n subscriptions,
1<->n is perfectly fine as I see it.

I think Jamal has a moral patent on the name netlink2 so be careful ;->
It should be possible to remain compatible, I don't see any
unresolveable issues right now.
