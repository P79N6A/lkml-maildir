Well, the patch is against -mm, because there already is a different version
of swsusp in -mm, which is needed for this patch to apply.
Originally, the patch consisted of two parts, the first one being fairly independent
on the second one, and the first part went into -mm before 2.6.11-rc4.
Now, I think it's better if I make a consolidated patch against 2.6.11.  Would
that be OK?
