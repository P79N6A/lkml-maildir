I knew you'd like it.
It kind of makes sense, because it puts the two primary stream-of-bytes
objects in Unix into the same namespace, with the same accessors.
So if some random application is expecting a filename well heck, you
just give it a path-to-executable with args.  It won't care, although
it may have trouble lseek()ing on it.
It wasn't very serious at all.
