What errors did you get? We need to know what the errors are to help you.

This is not an error. If you did not install a new kernel and reboot your 
computer with the new kernel, uname will still have the same kernel version. 
Once you have properly configured, compiled and installed the kernel and its 
modules, you reboot the computer to apply the new kernel. Then uname will 
give you the new version.
