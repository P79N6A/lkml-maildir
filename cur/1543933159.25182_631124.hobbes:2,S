Hi,
With 2.6.23 or newer (including 2.6.24-rc6) kernels, writing to the
/sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/display file does not do anything:
Cold boot to single user, then connect an external monitor
# cat  /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/display
1
OK, only the built in LCD is enabled. Try to enable
the external monitor as well:
# echo 3 > /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/display
still no image on the external.
# cat  /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/display
1
Still "1", not the "3" we wrote. On the other hand if I boot with an
external monitor attached, the "display" file always contains 3, even
after writing 1 there, and there is image on both monitors.
In 2.6.22 I had to load asus-laptop by hand, but then display
switching worked nicely.  
I've noticed that if I do 
# rmmod video
display switching starts working again with the newer kernels.
The "video" module was auto-loaded on my system in 2.6.22, but
did not cause the conflict.
This is an ASUS Z71V based notebook (detected as M7V).
Regards,
Andrei
