Nice.

No.  However, there is another optimisation which we can make.
Most ext3 commits, in practice, are lazy, asynchronous commits, and we
only nedd BH_Ordered_Tag for that, not *_Flush.  It would be easy
enough to track whether a given transaction has any synchronous
waiters, and if not, to use the async *_Tag request for the commit
block instead of forcing a flush.
We'd also have to track the sync status of the most recent
transaction, too, so that on fsync of a non-dirty file/inode, we make
sure that its data had been forced to disk by at least one synchronous
flush.  
But that's really only a win for SCSI, where proper async ordered tags
are supported.  For IDE, the single BH_Ordered_Flush is quite
sufficient.
Cheers,
 Stephen
