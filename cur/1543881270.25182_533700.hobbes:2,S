Greetings,
commit 226a6b84aaaf1fac7a5d41cf4e7387fd9ba895d5 renumbered Chapter 11 in 
Documentation/CodingStyle to Chapter 12, but it didn't update the reference 
to that chapter further down in the file. This patch corrects the chapter 
reference.

 very often is not. Abundant use of the inline keyword leads to a much bigger
 kernel, which in turn slows the system as a whole down, due to a bigger
 icache footprint for the CPU and simply because there is less memory
