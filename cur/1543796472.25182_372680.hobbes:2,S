No. If you need to remove major components, it is only diligent to bump
the minor revision and call the beast 2.7.0. At that time, not only one
or two subsystems, but all that were marked deprecated for 6 months or
so, should be dropped.

OK. This however doesn't hold for ipfwadm (which should probably never
have made it into 2.6.0 in the first place) or ipchains.

So what is the point in using Linux anyhow if the kernel developers
don't care for the outside world, one might ask? What is in the way of
reflecting feature removals in the minor version of the project, say,
remove devfs, ipfwadm, ipchains and whatnot in one go and call the new
release without this legacies 2.7.0?
