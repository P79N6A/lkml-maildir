No, I don't have (but maybe I'll get access to it soon). There was a request 
on lkml last week for a working version of this driver. For the moment I try 
to clean this up a bit before doing some real work. I found 4 major things 
that should be done, for half of them I have patches in a proof-of-concept 
state.
-split the interrupt handler into a handler and a tasklet
-remove the stack abuse
-use Linux 2.6 hardware probing code (this would cause the most problems for 
me, I'm not familiar with the preferred way of doing this for scsi drivers)
-fix kernel thread stopping
After this some more error checking at different places can't hurt. And a big 
Lindent run.
