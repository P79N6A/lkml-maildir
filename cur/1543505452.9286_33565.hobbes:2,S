Hi,
In 2.3.13 my soundcard doesn't work. 
It seems that the es1370 driver is not linked into the
kernel. es1370.c is compiled and the result is available
in linux/drivers/sound/sound.a, but when I look at the
resulting kernel (objdump --disassemble-all vmlinux |grep
es1370) the es1370 driver seems to be missing.
