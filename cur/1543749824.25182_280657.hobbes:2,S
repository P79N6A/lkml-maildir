This is more than a little bit silly.
The entire resume function holds spin_lock_irq() for far longer than a 
timer tick.
If we are going for a minimalist -rc patch, why not drop the lock, 
sleep, then reacquire the lock?
This strikes me as a bad change, make in haste for -rc, that will get 
quickly forgotten (and left as-is) once 2.6.10 is released.
