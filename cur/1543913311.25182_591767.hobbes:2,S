With 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 this doesn't happen anymore,
so whatever it was seems to be fixed.

This still happens identically with 2.6.23-rc4-mm1.
Mainline kernels like my TSC, -mm kernels don't.

2.6.23-rc4-mm1 reverts to mainline behaviour here.
(ie. "busy" instead of "no address or irqs")
Dunno if that's good or bad.

Gone in 2.6.23-rc4-mm1.
