	I don't follow you. Are you saying that a kernel that would fail a fork
should allow a vfork to succeed? Even when it has no idea how much
additional memory the process that completes the 'vfork' might need?
	Consider:
vfork();
execl(GetExecutableName(),...);
	Who knows how many pages 'GetExecutableName' might alter?
	If there is enough virtual memory to allow a vfork to succeed there is
enough to allow a fork to succeed. Overcommitting is either on or it's off.
