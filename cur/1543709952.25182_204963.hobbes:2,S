Subject: Problems with 2.6.4-rc2 NFS server and diskless clients

Using 2.6.4-rc2  on the NFS server together with Debian unstable
(nfs-kernel-server version 1:1.0.6-1), diskless clients can no longer
mount their root filesystems. The same configuration works with a 2.4
kernel on the server.
The client reports "nfs_get_root: getattr error = 116". No error
messages appear in the server logs. And the old recipe of exporting with
"no_subtree_check" makes no difference.
Anybody have any suggestions?
The NFS part of .config on the server is:
#
# Network File Systems
#
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_NFS_V3=y
# CONFIG_NFS_V4 is not set
# CONFIG_NFS_DIRECTIO is not set
CONFIG_NFSD=y
CONFIG_NFSD_V3=y
# CONFIG_NFSD_V4 is not set
# CONFIG_NFSD_TCP is not set
CONFIG_LOCKD=y
CONFIG_LOCKD_V4=y
CONFIG_EXPORTFS=y
CONFIG_SUNRPC=y
# CONFIG_SUNRPC_GSS is not set
