Mutex is not acceptable for performance reasons. I think we can just drop 
the RCU lock if we simply unregister the mmu notifier in release and 
forbid the drivers from removing themselves from the notification 
chain. They can simply do nothing until release. At that time there is no 
concurrency and thus its safe to remove even without rcu locking.

I do not follow you about the _begin without end but the following fix 
seems okay.
