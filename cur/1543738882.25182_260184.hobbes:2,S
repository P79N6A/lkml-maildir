That's not convincing enough to overcome inertia.
I can't see why the RT priority range would be increased.
It's overkill already, especially since Linux doesn't have
priority inheritance. Since POSIX requires 32 levels, that
is the right number. Actually using more than one level
(remember: NO priority inheritance) might not be wise.
If we stuck to 32 levels, RT and non-RT could both fit
within a 2-digit positive number. Also, there'd be fewer
bits for the scheduler to examine.
