I might agree with you on this wrt hacking around the kernel, but when it 
comes to introducing new subsystems, then we have a two fold situation:
  1.  Designing the internals of the new subsystem
  2.  Interfacing it with the rest of the kernel
Part 1 is completely independent of the implementation, it's part 2 that 
needs intricate implementation knowledge.
We recently had an example of this:  kexec based hibernation
So, what's wrong with tapping into people's design suggestions, and allowing 
others to implement it?
Thanks!
