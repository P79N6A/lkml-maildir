I think Paul Mackerras is the current maintainer now. I put him
into CC so that he can comment.

Only after you did an audit that it is really irqsave. A quick look
shows that it most likely isn't on SMP (lock_path() could deadlock when
it is both executed from irq and bh/user context on the same CPU) 
It is probably easier to just change USB. This is also more friendly
to the rest of the system (otherwise you would need to turn off interrupts
in the PPP layer making irq latency bad when 90% of all users don't 
need it)
