Hi Roland,
I've been playing with this most of the morning, finally got strace attached
to the telnet daemon, but it did me no good .. everything works when straced.
My technique was to replace /usr/sbin/in.telnetd with a script that invokes
the original binary under strace:
	# cd /usr/sbin
	# mv in.telnetd in.telnet.d.orig
	# cat <<EOF >in.telnetd
	/usr/bin/strace -ff -o /tmp/telnet.log.$$ /usr/sbin/in.telnetd.orig "$@"
	EOF
	# chmod 755 in.telnetd
Earlier this morning I systematically repeated my earlier, haphazard
experiments.  I built three kernels from two sources: the first source
was the pure 2.6.7-rc1-bk7 tree, the second the same tree with the suspect
waitid patch applied.  From these I built various kernels with and without
SMP and PREEMPT and ran at least seven 'telnet' tests on each.  The results:
   kernel       smp preempt | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
