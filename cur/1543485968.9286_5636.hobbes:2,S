	Hello.
   I've got one of these new toys and i'd like to use it under linux.
  My configuration:
  IBM NetFinity 5000
  Adaptec AIC-7895 on motherboard 
  Kernel 2.2.1
 + DVD-RAM drive patch from Nagai Hidetoshi <nagai@ai.kyutech.ac.jp>
that makes linux think that the DVD-RAM drive is
   two devices - a CD-ROM device and a MO device.
  I partitioned successfully /dev/sdf using fdisk -b 2048 /dev/sdf .
  When i do mke2fs -b 2048 -m 0 /dev/sdf1, mke2fs works until it says:
   ...
   Writing inode tables. Done.
   Writing superblocks.
  mke2fs hangs and i'm getting scsi errors:
  "aborting command due to timeout:
   Write (6) 00 00 54 20 00
   Write (6) 00 00 74 20 00
   timed out:reset.
  When i do mke2fs -b 1024 /dev/sdf1, mke2fs works until .
  Writing superblocks 10/79 and then SCSI bus hangs.
  Trying to use /dev/sdf unpartitioned (mke2fs -b 2048 /dev/sdf ) causes
  kernel panic "Bad block number requested".
  Drive works well as CD-ROM and I can mount DVD-ROM disks too.
  I'll be quite happy, if somebody helps me.
