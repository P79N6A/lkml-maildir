transport other-than-rs232 and b) the patches are nice and clean.

a) and b) above.  Plus: I'd want to see a maintainance person or team who
respond promptly to email and who remain reasonably engaged with what's
going on in the mainline kernel.  Because if problems crop up (and they
will), I don't want to have to be the bunny who has to worry about them...
