Ok. What this shows is that fixup_irqs() failed to move the irq properly.
Ideally we should see cpu_online_map here (i.e., 0xfd).
So most likely __assign_irq_vector() failed for some reason and I am
puzzled for the reason...
Does this problem happen only under certain stress or something simple, like
boot the kernel
echo 2 > /proc/irq/114/smp_affinity
wait for irq to hit the cpu1.
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
will immmd trigger this?
thanks,
