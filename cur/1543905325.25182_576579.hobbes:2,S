Subject: [PATCH -rt 4/9] ifdef raise_softirq_irqoff wakeup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/29/365

raise_softirq is called every timer interrupt in run_local_timers(),
which causes a thread wakeup to happen every timer interrupt. This
happens in !CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS, which means the wakeup is most
likely not needed. In addition it also fouls calc_load() since it's,
agian, observing at least one thread running on every invocation.
