Hi Albert,
I don't get it, you're saying that this zero-copy optimization, which happens 
entirely within the vfs, shouldn't be done because smb can't do it over a 
network?

I'd think the mmap-based copy would only use the technique on the data 
portion of a file.
Note that I'm not seriously proposing to do this, there are about 1,000 more 
important things.  I'm suggesting the original poster go take a look at the 
issues involved in making it happen.
