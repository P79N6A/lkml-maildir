Nah:
    Extended system attributes
        Extended system attributes are used by the kernel to store  sys-
        tem objects such as Access Control Lists and Capabilities.  Read
        and write access permissions to system attributes depend on  the
        policy  implemented  for  each  system  attribute implemented by
        filesystems in the kernel.
It's not *that* broken...
