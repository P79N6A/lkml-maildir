Donald,
I donnot want to run into the details that motivated this thread, but I
want to say that, in my opinion, you donnot deserve the criticisms I read
against you. A simple multiplication let me imagine your hard work for
maintaining your drivers. May-be the reasons are that Linus is
under-estimating the work that is actually needed for such a maintainance.
Pushing a driver bug to the kernel mainstream is catastrophic in terms of
time wasted for the maintainer and for users as well, given the number of
Linux users that try latest kernels. Delaying patches for the kernel
mainstream help delivering better stuff and I am sure it is your
intention. 
For a bug in the kernel, there is a army of volonteers that try to help,
but for a driver bug, the maintainer is mostly left alone and sometimes
unfairly accused. At least, it has been my observations.
By the way, we are using your drivers for years and have been quite
happy of their great quality. Many, many thanks, Donald, for your great
work.
Gérard.
