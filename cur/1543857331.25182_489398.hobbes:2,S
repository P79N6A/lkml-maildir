Subject: Disable INTx when enabling MSI

Some device manufacturers seem to think it's the OS's responsibility to 
disable legacy interrupt delivery when using MSI. If the driver doesn't 
handle it (which they generally don't), and the device isn't PCI-Express, 
a steady stream of legacy interrupts will be delivered in addition to the 
MSI ones, eventually leading to the legacy IRQ getting disabled, which 
kills any device that shares it.
Jeff proposed a patch in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/21/332
 when Linus 
wanted to do it in the PCI layer, but nobody seems to have told the actual 
PCI maintainer.
I'm trying to get a patch into -stable to do pci_intx in exactly the same 
situations, but only for forcedeth (which is the device that's causing 
problems for me), but that requires that the real solution be merged in 
the mainline.
