I got it working. It merely bitrotted faster than I could maintain it.

It was done for the occasion of the first publicly-announced boot of
Linux on a 64GB x86-32 machine.

It was not of the old type. It followed Hugh's strategy, which made
it fully backward-compatible. The only deficits in terms of success
were performance, maintenance, and attracting any sort of audience.
The only tester besides myself was literally Zwane.

It was exposed to the common code as MMUPAGE_SIZE. Significant pte
vectoring code in the core was involved, as well as partial page
distribution policies, mmap()/mprotect() et al handling splitting
across physical page boundaries, and the like. When done wrong,
applications such as /sbin/init didn't run. It was all there, though
Hugh's earlier implementation was far superior.
pte_chains didn't make things anywhere near as awkward as highpte.
pte_chains didn't really care so much how large an area a struct
page tracked. highpte OTOH needed more effort, though I don't recall
specifically why anymore.
My long-dead code should be at:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/wli/vm/pgcl/
dmesg's from 64GB x86-32 machines are also in that directory, dating
from March 2003.

Hugh had this all worked out in 2001. I explored some alternatives in
the design space, but they didn't perform as well as the original.
It's best to refer to his original patch for reference as it's far
cleaner, though in principle one should be able to find machines where
the late 2.5.x patches I did will run. It was never exposed to a very
broad variety of systems, so I can't vouch for much beyond NUMA-Q and
ThinkPad and whatever Zwane booted it on.

You may rest assured that it's technically feasible. It's been done.
The larger obstacles to all this are nontechnical.
