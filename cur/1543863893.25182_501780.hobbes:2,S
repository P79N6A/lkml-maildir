There is no such thing as a "stable release update" series anymore, you
should know that :)
It's incremental changes, over time, evolving into something new as you
look at the larger picture.

Well, as this HALD issue is the only thing that I have had reported, and
these patches have been in the -mm tree for quite some time, yes, I
think it is the only thing that has broken.
And yes, we have to have a way to evolve the api over time.  I thought
that given a kernel config option to allow the api to change, if your
userspace has also been updated, is the perfict way.  Then new distro
releases get to take advantage of the new stuff in the kernel, and we
don't break people who cling to Fedora Core 3 while wanting to run new
kernels (hi Andrew...)
In short, it's a bug, I messed up somehow.  And I'm trying to fix it
now, I don't think there's more that I can do, do you?

Can you give me the 'tree /sys/class/sound' output?
Does it work properly with old versions of hald now?
Is there anything else left to fix?
