Changes:
- updated to 2.6.9
- added m32r arch (haven't cleaned it too much though)
- in asm/page.h use getpagesize() on all archs
- some fixes here and there
Do note I'm having some technical problems with the script that generates the 
ChangeLog file so (a) it's empty in this release and (b) I might have missed 
something in the above list.
As to getpagesize() - as was suggested I've switched all PAGE_SIZE definitions 
to use that function on all archs so there's going to be lots of fun with 
fixing apps.
Enjoy.
