Thanks for giving it a spin! I have plans to implement some improvements
on monday that will speed it up even more, I hope I can talk you into
retesting it then. Basically it make sure we always get full speed out
of the drive by extending the 4kb reads with a sliding window cache.
That will help both drive efficiency, and also speed up the cases where
sub sequent boots differ just a little bit from the primed boot (often
the case with parallel init scripts). It should win you a few seconds
more in total, would be my guess.
I hope to be able to extend it to xfs and reiser in the very near future
as well, should not be hard to do.
