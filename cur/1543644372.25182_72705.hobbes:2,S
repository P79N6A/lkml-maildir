The boot time lock up, that I have indeed encountered intermittently ever 
since switching to 2.5.3{01}, may indeed be gone, but the one where just 
moving my mouse around locks things up in a matter of seconds hasn't. 
This started somewhere in 2.5.3{234}, only the latter of which I was able 
to compile for my box.
Someone recently reported having similar problems and fixing them by 
disabling MTRR, but this cannot be the entire story since I never had it 
enabled in the first place. No wonder, on a dual P5 machine...
By the way, 2.3.38 gives me this:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.38/kernel/net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_owner.o
depmod:         find_task_by_pid
