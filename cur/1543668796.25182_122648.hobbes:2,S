Sendmail, and a whole bunch of other mailers, have taken the more
liberal approach of allowing any RFC 822-compliant address in this
place (which is a *lot* more liberal than an RFC 821-compliant
reverse-path.)  This is consistent with the "be liberal in what you
accept, conservative in what you send" philosophy of network
interoperability.
I suspect in Sendmail it naturally falls out of using a single set of
canonicalization rules for all syntax.
