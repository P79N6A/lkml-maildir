On sparc64, I think we'll use 0xffffffffffffffff and we don't need any
old_getrlimit syscall simply because I can recompile all my 64bit userland
and I doubt anyone else has it.
On sparc32, I'd prefer to go back to 0x7fffffff but haven't heard Davem's
opinion on this.
If it will end up like this, glibc headers shall look like:
#if __WORDSIZE == 64
#define RLIM_INFINITY 0xffffffffffffffff
#else
#define RLIM_INFINITY 0x7fffffff
#endif
Cheers,
