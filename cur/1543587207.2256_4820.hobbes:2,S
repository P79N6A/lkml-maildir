I am having a very strange problem in linux 2.4 kernels.  I have not set
any iptables rules at all, and there is no firewall blocking any of my
outgoing traffic.  At what seems like random selection, I can not connect
to IP's yet I can get ping replies from them.  Most IP's reply just fine,
but certain ones fail to send even an ACK.  This problem disappears when I
boot into 2.2.  Here is a brief example of what I am talking about:
meatloop:~>ping 204.202.131.229
PING 204.202.131.229 (204.202.131.229): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 204.202.131.229: icmp_seq=0 ttl=42 time=114.7 ms
64 bytes from 204.202.131.229: icmp_seq=1 ttl=42 time=117.0 ms
 [iptraf output]

meatloop:~>telnet 204.202.131.229 80
Trying 204.202.131.229...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out
 [iptraf output]
209.192.217.120:32926              =       6             360   S---    eth0
204.202.131.229:80                 =       0               0   ----    eth0
and yet when I boot 2.2, I have not seen any problems of this nature.  Is
this a known issue?  Possibly a setting in /proc/sys/net/ipv4 that I dont
know about?  Thanks for your help...
