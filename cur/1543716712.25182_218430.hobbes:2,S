Thank you very much Allen for being involved in linux development.
Obsolecense is the best ending a temporary workaround could have.
I think I have found the problem with the Albatron KM18G-pro Mobos I have been
using.
They can't see through their Windows.??!@@#$$%%&*&

  Dear Ross,
  Thank you very much for contacting Albatron technical support.
  KM18G Pro has been proved under Windows 98SE/ME/2000/XP but Linux, so you
may encounter problems with it under Linux. We suggest you use Windows
98SE/ME/2000/XP for the stable performance. Sorry for the inconvenience and
please kindly understand it.
  Please let us know if you have any question.
  Best regards,
  Dr.Pro
