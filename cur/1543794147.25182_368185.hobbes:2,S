Rebuilt from a completely new and clean tree, 2.6.14-mm1 is fine, 2.6.15-rc1
will start booting OK, -rc1-mm1 chokes up almost instantly.  It doesn't live
long enough for either/both earlyprintk=vga or initcall_debug to output
anything - grub says "loading", clears the screen, and 2 seconds later the
laptop gives the 'ka-chunk' noise it does on a system reset, and I'm looking at
the BIOS splash screen.
Any obvious places to look, or time to play bisection on the 600 patches
in -mm?
