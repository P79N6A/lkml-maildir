Actually, after looking at the code again, I'm now quite convinced 2.2
has not this particular vulnerability. In order for the exploit to work,
you'd need mremap() to relocate you.
But mremap() won't take newaddr argument, so you can't get yourself
relocated explicitly. And mremap() will not relocate yourself implicitly
to some random spot neither, because since newlen is zero, it will
always trigger the shrinking code, which will just munmap() and bail
out.
ihaquer, any comments? Is there something we don't know about? If not,
please correct your announcement.
Kind regards,
