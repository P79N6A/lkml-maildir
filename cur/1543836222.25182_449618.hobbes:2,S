Ofcourse, it is also entirely possible that you understand perfectly,
and that seems to be the case here.  If the svc_sock_names call in
write_ports returns success, we should do a 'lockd_down' - and make
sure it does return success only if the close succeeded.

The first is simply to counter the reference that was gained in
nfsd_create_serv. 
The second chunk (removing sv_nrthread++) is fixing a bug in an
earlier patch.  We never should have had that ++ there, as
'svc_create' created the object with a reference already.
