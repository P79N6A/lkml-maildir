__attribute__((weak)) can turn compile error into runtime errors - you 
won't notice at compile time if it was forgotten to compile the 
non-weak version into the kernel (e.g. due to a typo in the Makefile).
Patch 05/17 from the 2.6.15.1 patchset contains a fix for such a bug
present in 2.6.15.
A variation of this problem can occur in cases like __raw_memcpy_toio32 
if it was forgotten to compile the non-weak version into the kernel and 
the kernel therefore uses the non-optimized version. That's not fatal, 
but it might take years until someone notices that there might be a few 
percent of performance missing.
