When the machine reboots from a power interruption Internet connection
may be unavailable (usual here). Ntpd can start synchronized to an RTC
but time is inaccurate because hwclock has not adjusted it. When
Internet connection reestablishes ntpd notices the time conflict and
terminates.  Human intervention or cron lines can run ntpdate and then
restart ntpd. This results in time of low quality.
There are lots of high quality and cost hardware solutions.  The
solution in my first post was a very small kernel patch to add an
11 minute update log so hwclock etc could adjust the time.  Any
comments on my patch?
