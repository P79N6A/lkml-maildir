Thanks.
Please then try the latest ACPI patch here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/release/2.6.13/acpi-20050902-2.6.13.diff.gz
It should apply to vanilla 2.6.13 with a reject in ia64/Kconfig
that you can ignore.
If this works, then we munged git-acpi.patch in 2.6.13-mm1 somehow.
If this fails, then please confirm it still fails with pnpacpi=off
if it still fails, then please open a bugzilla here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
component=config-interrupts
build the failing kernel with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=y
boot it with "acpi=noirq" and attach the output from
dmesg -s64000
lspci -vv
cat /proc/interrupts
acpidump, available in the latest pmtools here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
also include the dmesg -s64000 from the successful
acpi-enabled 2.6.13 boot, along with its /proc/interrupts.
If you have a  serial console and can then capture the
failing console log with "debug", that would be ideal.
Where we got from there will depend what we see...
thanks,
-Len
