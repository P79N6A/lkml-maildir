Well, it's not 10 billion items, but closer to....60 :-)  And
the current component list is pretty complete, right?  We don't
want to add anything that is not included in the official trees.
By the way, have you looked at Red Hat Bugzilla?  They have
several hundreds of components in a single scroll-down list
(they define a component as a package).  Of course, the list is
alphabetical, so it's not too bad to use it.
So I think 60+ is definitely a manageable number.

The approach above does not need any long-term solution.  We should
try to avoid adding too much code above the base Mozilla code base
since it would be tough to upgrade the kernel bugzilla to a later
version of Mozilla code and it would introduce bugs which we don't
want.
