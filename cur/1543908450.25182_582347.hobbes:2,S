I must say I've been wondering about relatime a bit as well. Are there 
actually users who do really want atime, but not badly enough to want real 
atime?
I've been running with noatime for years now and do not plan on changing 
that so have been shrugging this entire discussion off with "no care of 
mine", but whose care _is_ it?

mount -o atime. Or as far as I'm concerned, keep the default as posixly 
compliant as one wants and teach people and distributions to mount "noatime" 
as I hear some have already been doing. I may be wrong, but to me, relatime 
sounds like compromising for the sake of compromising...
