There is definately something going on with these cards.
Ref. my LKML thread here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/11/25
My card as reported in dmesg:
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 0000:00:0f.0
ALSA device list:
  #0: SBLive 5.1 [SB0060] (rev.7, serial:0x80611102) at 0xe000, irq 12
lspci:
00:0f.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10k1 (rev 07)
00:0f.1 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! MIDI/Game Port (rev 07)
Now, I built and installed latest:
alsa-utils-1.0.11rc2
alsa-lib-1.0.11rc3
and _that_ appeared to fix my problem.  But I just rebooted, and prior
to reboot as root I issued alsactl restore ~ no problems.
Following reboot, I now get (different control error) this:
alsactl: set_control:888: warning: iface mismatch (3/2) for control #80
alsactl: set_control:890: warning: device mismatch (0/0) for control #80
alsactl: set_control:892: warning: subdevice mismatch (0/0) for control #80
alsactl: set_control:894: warning: name mismatch (EMU10K1 PCM Send
Routing/External Amplifier) for control #80
alsactl: set_control:896: warning: index mismatch (0/0) for control #80
alsactl: set_control:898: failed to obtain info for control #80
(Identifier removed)
And now the confusing bit.  If I run alsamixer but DO NOT DO ANYTHING,
exit, then issue 'alsactl store', then 'alsactl restore' works again
OK - until next reboot...
