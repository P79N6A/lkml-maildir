Well some more descriptions of what the system does after that copy-to-nfs
would help.  Does it _ever_ come good, or is a reboot needed, etc?
What does `vmstat 1' say during the copy, and during the ls?
/proc/vmstats before and after the ls.
Try doing the copy, then when it has finished do the old
memset(malloc(24M)) and monitor the `vmstat 1' output while it runs,
capture /proc/meminfo before and after.
None of the problems you report are present on x86 as far as I can tell,
so...
