It should be possible for it to clone only the portion that they actually 
care about based on where the known-good version is. It should also (in 
theory, anyway) be possible to put off some amount of the download until 
it's actually going to be relevant.

None of this is going to take as long, even on a slow link and a slow 
computer, as waiting for a response to a mailing list post. It'd annoy 
users who are specifically waiting for it, but if the interface is that 
the user says "kernel package X didn't work but the current kernel does", 
and it says "I'll let you know when I've got something to test", and the 
user watches a DVD, and afterward finds a message saying there's something 
to test, and tries it, and reports how it went, and the process repeats 
until it narrows it down to a single commit after a couple of days of the 
user getting occasional responses, it's not that different from asking for 
help online.

Could have a distro-provided mask of things that aren't worth testing and 
possibly back-ported fixes for revisions in particular ranges.

That would probably help for giving the user something to try right away. 
I still think that the main cost to the user is the number of times that 
the user has to stop doing stuff to reboot with a kernel to test, whether 
the test kernels are available quickly from the distro site, slowly built 
locally, or slowly as suggested by humans helping online.
