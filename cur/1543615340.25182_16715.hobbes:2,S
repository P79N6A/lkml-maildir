Which it may do with another function *or expression* as well, because
the real bug has already happened before the function call comes into
the issue.
As far as I'm concerned the options are: fix RELOC; obviate RELOC; use
an appropriate gcc option if available (-fPIC might be it, -ffreestanding
certainly isn't--see above); *extend* (not fix, extend) gcc; or work
around all individual cases.  In rough descending order of preference.
