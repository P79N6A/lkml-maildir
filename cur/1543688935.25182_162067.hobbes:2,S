Unfortunately, that was not personal attack, that was a fact. Even
Patrick had to agree that his -test4 changes were bad idea, and I even
have "official apology" from him (on irc).
He just thinks he can fix his code, and I want that code to be
reverted, reviewed, tested, and than merged back. There's no way
current mess can be fixed in reasonable time.
I've seen no discussion about that code, and certainly have not seen
that code before it was merged, which is strange since I'm listed as
software suspend maintainer.
