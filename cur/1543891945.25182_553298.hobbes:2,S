yeah. I tried !hres and !dynticks too and that doesnt make any 
difference to the end result - so my guess is on the NMI watchdog 
re-programming thing on K8 CPUs (running the 32-bit kernel), which is 
done in every NMI tick. check_watchdog() for some reason thought there's 
no NMI, and later on an NMI still arrived? Something like that.
vanilla kernel works fine.
