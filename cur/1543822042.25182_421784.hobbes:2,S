Jon please stop spouting crap at least, every ISR doesn't need pci_enable, 
as it doesn't need it now, you are NOT listening, adding the enable bit 
DOES NOT change things, if someone runs setpci from userspace now they can 
do this, ROOT CAN CRASH YOUR MACHINE, FILM AT 11.
If you enable the rom at the moment you can crash things, some devices 
don't have enough address decoders to decode a bar and the ROM, so me 
enabling ROM decoding as your original patch did, can cause system 
lockups,
why is this different, why didn't you write the ROM code patch properly 
then and we woulnd't have to to hear about it now...
Dave.
