Subject: [PATCH] EXPORTFS: handle NULL returns from fh_to_dentry()/fh_to_parent()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/8/333

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@citi.umich.edu>
While 440037287c5 "[PATCH] switch all filesystems over to
d_obtain_alias" removed some cases where fh_to_dentry() and
fh_to_parent() could return NULL, there are still a few NULL returns
left in individual filesystems.  Thus it was a mistake for that commit
to remove the handling of NULL returns in the callers.
Revert those parts of 440037287c5 which removed the NULL handling.
(We could, alternatively, modify all implementations to return -ESTALE
instead of NULL, but that proves to require fixing a number of
filesystems, and in some cases it's arguably more natural to return
NULL.)
Thanks to David for original patch and Linus, Christoph, and Hugh for
review.

This thread seems to have died out, and I didn't see any objections to
handling the error in the caller as Linus suggested, so here's the
patch.
