I already activate swsusp using either the sleep button (
/proc/acpi/events -> acpid -> script) or the gkrellm acpi addin that
monitors battery levels. I'm sure acpid could do the lid switch too.
That's for initiating the suspend, of course. As I said, I'm not about
to bloat swsusp further by adding code to test for the switches during
suspend.

Nigel
