Hi Hiroshi,
Here goes the extra info that you asked for:
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
performance
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
300759
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
300759
$ echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
powersave
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
23042
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
23042
One other strange thing that I've noticed is that I'll never get the same
frequency when switching to powersave govenor. It allways gets increased a
little bit. For example:
$ echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
24453
$ echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
27779
$ echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
29947
$ echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
32400
Thanks for checking this.
