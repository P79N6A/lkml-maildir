I believe that is the intention, in that the caller should insure that
the cpu does not go offline.  But also as Rusty stated, the previous usages
of set_cpus_allowed did not always insure this, so it's at least not a
regression.
I'll put it on my todo list to check the references in tip/cpus4096 to see
where they stand on the get_online_cpus() issue.
Thanks,
