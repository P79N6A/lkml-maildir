Someone has to have the hardware to test with.  Hence my "debug by
email" comment.

The Ralink wireless drivers are working to get their stuff upstream.  I
think there is only some wireless infrastructure needed to complete
before it gets into mainline, but you will have to ask them about this.
There was a wireless-mini-summit a week or so ago, so those developers
all know what is going on in that space right now.  They are facing a
number of different regulatory issues, combined with lack of
specifications from some vendors.  I don't think that the developers who
actually have specs are complaining about anything right now.

The ISDN maintainer has a large rewrite almost done, and anyone is
welcome to help him out if they are still using and needing that old
hardware.  As almost no one objects to the current code, I'm guessing
that there is no such real need :)
