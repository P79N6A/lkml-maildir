Does the following:
	struct kmem_cache *cpuset_cache __read_mostly;
mark just the one word pointer 'cpuset_cache' as __read_mostly,
or does it mark the whole dang cpuset cache?
I presume it just marks the one pointer word.  Am I wrong?
I ask because the subtle phrasing of your comment reads to
my ear as if you knew it marked the entire cache.  I can't
tell if that is due to my ears having a different language
accent than yours, or if it is due to my getting this wrong.
