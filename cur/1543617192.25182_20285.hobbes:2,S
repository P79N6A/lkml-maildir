1. special collection by default
2. user-specified as desired
I think the dietlibc idea has to be scrapped so we can run BSD apps.
(and others maybe, but I'm not looking to start a flame war)
uClibc is LGPL, so traditional 4-clause BSD licensed code can be
linked with it.

DNS is very good to have. There are many things one might want
to specify by name. NFS servers, NIS servers, SMB servers, and
even the machine itself to get an IP via DNS.

a.out
Even with ELF, you shouldn't need that 10 kB. Treat ELF like a.out,
getting rid of the -fPIC stuff in favor of offsets assigned when
you build the initramfs. Dynamic linking should be:
open
mmap
mmap
close
You know the file to open. You know what offset you need it at.
There isn't any need for symbols. OK, that's half-dynamic,
but it gets the job done.
