The invariant could be that any single new patch added should still
compile. And it should apply of course. If not then warn the submitter.
Might generate quite a lot of email though.
Problem is when people add new stuff in multiple pieces that only
compile together though. iirc they go to mm-commits as individual
pieces, not a bundle right now.
It would probably not catch everything - just a few common
configurations and architectures.

If it's caught early enough the submitter can be warned and they
might even fix it up themselves and send a new patch.

Write a checklist for that?
