You get no disagreement from me with the concept, and I'm following
a similar one in a system I'm working on now.  (as to the standards
conformance, look at my most recent email a few messages ago on
that...  we're arguing it out  ;-).
The Linux kernel at this point, however, is not so easy/orthogonal
as you claim, I think.  The question always arises:  If there is
no other easy way to do something than modify your low-level
technical interface, then what do you do?
