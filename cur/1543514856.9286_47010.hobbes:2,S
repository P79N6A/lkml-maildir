With initrd support enabled, the build of 2.3.24 aborts at init/main.c due
to an undeclared variable ('memory_start'). Searching further, I noticed
the following two lines had been removed in patch 2.3.23.
static unsigned long memory_start = 0;                                         
static unsigned long memory_end = 0; 
Can I safely reverse the changes in 2.3.24 ?
