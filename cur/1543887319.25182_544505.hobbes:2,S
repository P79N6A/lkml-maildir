Do we really need the unlikely()? d_union may be a new feature,
but it may very well be possible that someone puts the bigger
part of his/her files under a union. And when d_unions get
stable, people will probably begin making their root filesystem
unioned for livecds, and then unlikely() will rather be a
likely penalty. My stance: just
	if (dentry != NULL && dentry->d_union != NULL)
This also goes for union_trylock.

	return locked ? 1 : 0
or even
	return !!locked;
or since we're just passing up from mutex_trylock:
	return locked;

More commonly known as "insomnia". :)
