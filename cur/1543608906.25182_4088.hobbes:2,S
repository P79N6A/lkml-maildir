Hello, dear maintainers,
I found a problem on 2.4.14 kernel's loop back device driver
that still contains 'deactivate_page' service calls
even if the service seems be removed on 2.4.14.
(drivers/block/loop.c)
Maybe it is enough simply removing them from loop.c
but I am afraid that it may cause any memory leak on the
system.
I hope that it will fixed in next release.
Thank you,
and I'm very sorry my broken strange English.
