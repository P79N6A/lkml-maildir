The process is of course in the process list, if that's what you mean by
'running'.

The output is always the same modulo the transmitted packet numbers:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:16:CB:A2:E4:43  
          inet addr:192.168.0.101  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::216:cbff:fea2:e443/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:269 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:57 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

          RX bytes:72528 (70.8 KiB)  TX bytes:7900 (7.7 KiB)
          Interrupt:17 
The RX/TX counts are reset to 0 after a resume.

Yes of course. Nothing interesting.
