Thanks for the response Mikael.
Is your 486 running a IDE disk on a normal interface or via USB?  I wonder 
if the NSLU2 only having I/O via USB might be significant.  Also, this is a 
2.6 kernel and I've seen spurious reports across the internet about similar 
oom-killer problems since about 2.6.7.
Thanks!
