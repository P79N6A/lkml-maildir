It's much worse than you can imagine!
`strings /proc/kcore | grep GNU' >qqq.qqq`
Causes a file this big to be generated:
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      1069748 Oct  9 10:01 qqq.qqq
That's how much space is being wasted by GNU advertising.
A single program:
int foo;
Compiled, produces this:
	.file	"xxx.c"
	.version	"01.01"
gcc2_compiled.:
	.comm	foo,4,4
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)"
It __might__ be possible to link, without linking in ".ident", which
currently shares space with .rodata. My gcc man pages are not any
better than the usual Red Hat so I can't find out if there is any way
to turn OFF these spurious strings.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
