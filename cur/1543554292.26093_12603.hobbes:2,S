Yes, Andrea, I know that paging is disabled at the point of loading the
image but I was talking about the inability to boot (boot == complete
booting, i.e. at least reach start_kernel()) a kernel with very large
.data or .bss segments because of various reasons -- one of which,
probably,is the inadequacy of those pg0 and pg1 page tables set up in
head.S
So, what is still a bit unclear is -- if the only way to create a huge
bzImage is by having huge .text or .data or .bss, what is the combination
of the limits? I.e. which limit do we hit first -- the one on bzImage
(which Peter says is infinite?) or the ones on .text/.data/.bss (and what
exactly are they?)? See my question now?
Regards,
Tigran
