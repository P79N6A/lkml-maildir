Distributed shared memory is a fundamentally flawed idea. It pretends
to be SMP when it really isn't. With SMP I can have two CPUs writing
to the same page (different cache lines) at the same time and it's
fast.
With DSM, you've got MMU tricks to only allow one machine at a time to
write. If one CPU writes and then the other reads, you've got shift
the page across the network.
With SMP, a lock is cheap. With DSM, a lock is expensive.

Your analogy is broken. Multitasking has hardware support and is a
cheap operation. DSM has no hardware support and is an expensive
operation.
Even on machines which do have hardware support (SGIs Origin series),
it's my understanding that getting page migration to work properly has
been a problem.

Yeah, right. Lets rewrite the kernel in Java: it provides such nice
abstractions.

My point is that DIPC/DSM is the *wrong* abstraction. Same goes for
MOSIX.

Sure, in *computer science*. CS labs around the world have been
producing new operating systems for decades, each one is more abstract
than the ones before. Now tell me how many of them are actually used
in the real world?

You don't need DSM to provide a nice and easy programming environment.

Let me tell you about what I've done for my distributed volume
rendering application. First, I wrote it in a message-passing
paradigm, because I had a message-passing machine. Then I rewrote it
to use threads, because I had SMP machines. Later, I rewrote it to use
message-passing for remote nodes and threads for local nodes.
The task is divided into jobs which are scheduled
appropriately. Scheduling locally is much faster (tens of
microseconds) than scheduling remotely (milliseconds). I need to be
aware of that. I'm down to the level where if I spend another one or
two milliseconds waiting for data to come over the network, I start
losing a few percent here and there. Total rendering time is 0.5
seconds.
I'm getting 73% parallel efficiency on a network of 5 machines:
dual PII 400
dual PII 266
dual PPro 180
dual Pentium 133
dual Pentium 133
I have techniques in mind to increase efficiency. Just one alone
should take it to 76%. It's hard work getting high efficiency on a
network of machines which have such a different range of performances,
especially when you can't predict how much work is involved in each job.
If I were to take my basic threaded code and run it with DIPC/DSM or
MOSIX, I'd consider myself lucky to get 10% efficiency.

DIPC (as in: strict message-passing) is one thing. Distributed shared
memory is another. Two nodes banging on the same page just isn't going
to run well with DSM.

No, go back and read what I said. DSM is the *wrong* abstraction. DIPC
without the DSM it is OK (as long as the kernel isn't bloated with it:
do it in the library).
