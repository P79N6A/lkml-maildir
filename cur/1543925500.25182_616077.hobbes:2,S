http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/>
It's probably not serious but I wonder if checkpatch catches this.
Applying patch..git-net.patch
Warning: commit message does not conform to UTF-8.
You may want to amend it after fixing the message, or set the config
variable i18n.commitencoding to the encoding your project uses.
