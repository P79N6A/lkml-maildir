I'm not saying it should not work automagically. But it is wrong to
start transmitting on wireless as soon as kernel boots. It should stay
quiet in the radio until it is either told to talk or until interface
is upped.
That way 
* above still works, only radio chat begins one step later
* if you are in environment where you absolutely do not want it to
talk on the radio (airplane, BlackHatCon with APs trying to hack you
all around), you can make it quiet without needing kernel/module
parameters.
