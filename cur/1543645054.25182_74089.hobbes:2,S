Hi,
Even i thought of this scenario, but what puzzles me,
other sockets running in the system are able to
receive data (ie) send TCP ACKs through the same
driver.
This is the only socket which *sends* relatively huge
amount of data, other sockets running when this
happens are able to receive data (ie) send TCP ACK's.
Retransmit fails only when there is high activity on
the network cable (caused by flood pinging). When
there is no flood pinging(or high network activity),
apps work for days together.
Can this still be a network driver problem?
Thanks & Cheers,
Venkatesh
