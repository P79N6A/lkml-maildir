Subject: [PATCH] fix kernel oops with CF-Cards

Hello,
when a mounted CF-Card is removed from the system, inserted back into 
the slot, removed again, and then umount is called for that device the 
kernel oopes.
(This is a slightly different issue than noted in my last mail.)
This happens because the reference counting gets confused. When a disk 
gets released by ide_disk_release() it sets the driver_data member of 
the corresponding drive to NULL. This is bad, as the pyhsical drive 
could be assigned to another idkp structure in the meantime (happens, 
when the drive is removed and inserted again).
My fix is to simply leave the drive alone when a disk is released. This 
shouldn't cause any side-effects - drive->driver_data isn't tested for 
containing NULL anywhere.
The following patch (against vanilla 2.6.13) fixes that problem:
