I get much closer numbers if the patches directory is already in 
cache...data=ordered means more contention for the disk when trying to read 
the patches.  
If the patches are hot in the cache data=writeback and data=ordered both take 
about 30s.  You still see some writes in data=writeback, but these are mostly 
async log commits.  
The same holds true for vanilla git as well, although it needs 1m7s to apply 
from a hot cache (sorry, couldn't resist the plug ;)
