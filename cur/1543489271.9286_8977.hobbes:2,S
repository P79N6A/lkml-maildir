   This should put data on the wire if
   1. there are no packets in flight.
   2. we are not retransmitting.
   3. the right edge of the frame does not exceed receivers window.
Ok.
   Actually point 3. fails when I get the stall.
   Your fix in cleanup_rbuf() makes the receiver send window updates
   but these might get lost in the network. There is no retrans timer
   because all data has been acked.
If all data has been sent and ack'd, it's no big deal and should not
deadlock.  Because even if the sender does not see the window open up
enough, the retransmit timer on that packet will let one packet out.
The only time data is pending and the retransmit timer is not active
is when the 0 window probe time is running, and what it does is send a
dummy "current sequence number - 1" frame to try and get an ack back.
Once the ack comes back, with a suitable window, the probe timer turns
off and the retransmit timer is re-enabled.
This is essentially how acks being dropped are handled by TCP.
Now we have to find the hole where this isn't working in your deadlock
case :-)
I see one possible hole, and why 2.0.x wasn't effected yet did the
same thing (sort of).  Partial frames.  The idea behind this scheme is
that you hold onto non-full size frames until you're done with the
user's current set of writes, hoping you can tack on later data and
make a full sized one.  (this fixed a bug we had in writev() when
apache would write the http header then the data in subsequent iovec[]
entries, we would send the tiny http header out in a tiny packet).
The bit of code you cite is where we try to catch the last partial
frame.  2.0.x had an ugly timer which made sure it got sent
eventually, if we didn't send it at tcp_sendmsg() time.  I think here
is the area of the problem, because in 2.2.x I bypass the PROBE0 tests
when tacking on partial frames in tcp_send_skb(), but no code later
rechecks it.
I hope this is it, it is untested, but please try this patch (against
2.2.3):
Later,
