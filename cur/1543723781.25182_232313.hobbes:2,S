How can this be off-topic?  In case of IDE disks HDIO_GETGEO is handled by
ide-disk driver.  In 2.4 there was ide-geometry.c file (part of IDE driver)
which contained code for retrieving BIOS geometry (Andries removed it in 2.5),
Restoring 2.4 way of handling HDIO_GETGEO requires changes to the IDE driver.

I understand this perfectly and I'm thinking about the best way to solve it.

Calm down because your false accusations are also documented now. ;-)
