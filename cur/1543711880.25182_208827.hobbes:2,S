Hello,
I am trying to register an ide device in my driver code. Can i get some 
insight
into the ide-register API and its parameter. Also  do i have to set   the IRQ 
level. I am trying to get the equivalent of scsi_register for ide device.  
What all things i need to  consider?.
Please let me know.
Thanks
Jay
