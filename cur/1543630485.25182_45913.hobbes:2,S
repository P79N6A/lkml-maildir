Hi,
I am using kernel 2.4.17 on SuperMicro P4DP6 motherboard (Dual Xeon, 1GB
RAM).
There is a problem in this kernel, that IRQs coming from several PCI slots
are not handled by kernel.
I found that kernel 2.4.18 solved this problem, but has a lot of another
additions which I do not need (the patch file is about 4 Mb).
I cannot change the kernel version on my system, however can apply some
patches which solve a particular problems.
Can someone help me to find the developer solved the PCI IRQ problem in
2.4.18 or point to the kernel patch (not the full 2.4.17 -> 2.4.18 one)?
Thanks
Kosta Porotchkin
