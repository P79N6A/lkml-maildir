The mode of the file is irrelevant. Access to a file is ruled by the
permissions on the directory or directories leading to the file. Access
to the *contents* of the file depends on the mode of the file itself. A
directory contains files, the files contain data.
This according to the traditional Unix file permissions model, which is
quite logical, IMHO.
