I admit I haven't gone through the patch carefully yet. Overall
it looks good except for a problem which bothers me. The "raw"
prio_tree can only handle unique intervals, i.e., we cannot
insert two intervals with the same indices. Check vm_set.head
and vma_prio_tree_* functions to see how multiple vmas with
identical indices are handled.

Maybe in your case you don't have to worry about storing multiple
identical intervals. However, if we are generalizing prio_tree then
we have to consider that, I guess. This is similar to map and multi_map
in C++. I _guess_ in prio_tree case we will be using the multi_
variant more often. So, I was thinking something like this:
struct raw_prio_tree_node {}
/* same as in your patch */
struct unique_prio_tree_node {}
/* same as prio_tree_node in your patch */
struct prio_tree_node {}
/* somthing similar to shared in vm_area_struct */

I wish we could have a patch using the generlized prio_tree when
we propose to merge the generalized prio_tree code.

I don't think the performance drop will be measurable.
Thanks,
