i didn't change alloc_mem, it still get range from one node and continuous.
new free_bootmem could remove the assumpition in
setup_64.c::setup_arch:free_bootmem about node0
                        /* Assumes everything on node 0 */
                        free_bootmem(ramdisk_image, ramdisk_size);
                        printk(KERN_ERR "initrd extends beyond end of memory "
                               "(0x%08lx > 0x%08lx)\ndisabling initrd\n",
                               ramdisk_end, end_of_mem);
                        initrd_start = 0;
