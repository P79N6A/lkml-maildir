I've run V7 unix.  V7 has no mkdir syscall. mkdir on V7 was a library
call that ran a setuid binary that did a mknod and then used ln to build
the links.
mkdir() the syscall is a relatively modern invention, and even then you
could use ln as root to link directories for a long time. Often the standard
ln binary prevented it but it could be done (eg SunOS)
