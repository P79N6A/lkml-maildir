Actually I thought I had missed it, being away for several weeks and
unsubscribed.  Now it looks like the new routing code is in the kernel
but nobody outside the network developers seems to have known about it.
Alexey mentioned his iproute2 package a few times but that was about
it.
Alexey Kuznetsov completely rewrote the kernel routing code.  The only
docs I could find were Documentation/network/policy-routing.txt (old),
a few notes in the iproute2 package (
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing
)
and one by timur@tepkon.ru (
ftp://post.tepkom.ru//pub/vol2/Linux/docs
).
None of them are ready for end users yet, you are expected to
understand routing and read the source.  It does not help when ip
displays its syntax and it does not match what is in the code :(.
The old tools (ifconfig, route) still work up to a point.  They cannot
do the fancy work like route by source address or ToS.  Also, as
already pointed out on this list, they can confuse users by appearing
to show duplicate entries.  Also alias handling with ifconfig in 2.[12]
has some problems, although that may be unrelated.
There is an rpm for iproute2, an Australian RedHat mirror had it as
ftp://ftp.aarnet.edu.au/disks/.22/Tango/SRPMS/iproute2-990107-23.src.rpm
ftp://ftp.aarnet.edu.au/disks/.22/Tango/i386/iproute2-990107-23.i386.rpm
