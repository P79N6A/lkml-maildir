Sorry to disturb you again guys, my previous e-mail contained
a factual error:

Russell contacted me and provided a corrective information.
The kernel which I used is somewhat out of date,
Linux 2.3.23 contains a correct code, with ioremap().
Also, on the date the code above was written, ioremap() was
not present in the arm architecture, so it could not be used.
I mentioned cyber2000fb.c because I considered it for a JavaStation
to replace igafb.c, as rmk's driver is way superior to the one we use.
Sorry for the misinformation,
--Pete
