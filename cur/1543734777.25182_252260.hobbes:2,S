Has anybody ever explained why there is an attempt to
minimize the size of the kernel stack? Temporary data
allocation on the stack is FREE! The compiler just
adjusts offsets for data. Even dynamic data-allocation
takes only one instruction, (subl %reg, %esp).
On Intel machines, the compiler requires that SS and DS
be the same so that data can be accessed off the stack.
That means that the stack-pointer is just some arbitrary
offset in the segment(s) with enough room for downward
growth. Changing if from the original 0x1000 (one Intel
PAGE_SIZE) to anything smaller is weird, sort of like a
contest to see how long one can hold the wrong end of
a torch.
It seems that some hole got opened up with the PREEMPTABLE
KERNEL changes (read recursion). Removing stack data allocation
just masks a far more egregious problem, I think.
