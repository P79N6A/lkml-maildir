Agreed- this would work from a Token Ring POV as long as there is a ring
number difference (and obvious bridge) between the adapters. "Load
Balancing" would then be like NetBEUI- first come, first serve and the
client would then ALWAYS use the adapter with which it got it's initial
session.

Are these cards (and clients) going to be on seperate rings or ports on a
token switch?
If not, then this will do you no good.

No, what you are talking about is channel bonding, 'ethernet bridging'
would be making your system look like a layer-2 ethernet switch.
