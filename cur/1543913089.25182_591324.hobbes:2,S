Why?  Create a pipe, start a new process, put the reader struct file
into its descriptor table as stdin, do execve in new process and
pass the writer struct file to ->core_dump().
As the matter of fact, it's already done - see
        lock_kernel();
        ispipe = format_corename(corename, core_pattern, signr);
        unlock_kernel();
        if (ispipe) {
                /* SIGPIPE can happen, but it's just never processed */
                if(call_usermodehelper_pipe(corename+1, NULL, NULL, &file)) {
                        printk(KERN_INFO "Core dump to %s pipe failed\n",
                               corename);
                        goto fail_unlock;
                }
        } else
                file = filp_open(corename,
                                 O_CREAT | 2 | O_NOFOLLOW | O_LARGEFILE | flag,
                                 0600);
in do_coredump().  So take a look at fs/exec.c:format_corename() and see
what to feed for it in order to get the equivalent of your patch.
core_patttern is set by sysctl (just say
echo [whatever] >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern 
and don't forget quoting, since | should be the first character to indicate
that you want to pipe coredump through a helper).
I really don't see a reason to do that kind of work in the kernel, embedded
system or not.
