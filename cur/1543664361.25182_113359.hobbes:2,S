Thanks for the suggestion...
I got another one, telling me to have a look at the e100 driver,
and this raises a question I have for quite a long time : why does
the Kernel have two different supports for the same hardware ?
Is this a migration plan, a long run "please switch from eepro100
to e100" ?
Is there a better working one ?
I don't say that, once a driver exists, no one should ever think
of doing another one, but there are little indication as to which
one people should select...
Quite puzzling ;-)
Regards,
Paul
