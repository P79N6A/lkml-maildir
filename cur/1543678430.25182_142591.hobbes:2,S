And did you use S4bios with 2.4.X? apm and acpi are really different.
Modification you did is wrong; I'd try
#ifdef CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
        if ((state == 4) && (state_string[1] != 'b')) {
	        software_suspend();
                goto Done;
        }
#endif  
Does s3 work for you? s3 and s4bios should be really similar.
