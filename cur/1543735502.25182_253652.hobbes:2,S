Great, that works for you.  But what about when you have a slow usb hub
that the device is plugged into.  It will take a while for the USB core
to recognize that device and set everything up properly (and who's to
say it will be called /dev/sda anyway?).

My point is we _can not_ be dumb and synchronous in this situation.  It
just will not work with busses that have devices that can come and go as
the system is running.  It is pretty much impossible to correctly do
what you are proposing.  Just think about the different situations that
we have to handle properly.
