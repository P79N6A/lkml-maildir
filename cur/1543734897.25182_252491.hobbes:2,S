I got a similar problem here, I am running 2.6.9-rc2 with acpi patch. I
got an e1000, ipsec is compiled in, modules loaded, racoon started but
no tunnels configured.
The system freezes when I type apt-get update, in the moment apt-get
tries to connect all the mirrors or resolves them.
I did not see any messages, sysrq was not compiled in, so I cannot check
if it still works.
