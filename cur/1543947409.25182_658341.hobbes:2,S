Hi Nick,
this paragraph reads a little weird...  really what happens is that
each forked task is in the same UTS namespace as its parent, unless
it was cloned with CLONE_NEWUTS or has done unshare(CLONE_NEWUTS),
in which case it receives a copy.

Same as with UTS, except that upon CLONE_NEWIPC the task receives a
blank new ipc namespace, not a copy of the original.

A cloned process inherits the pid namespace hierarchy from its
parent.  If it was cloned with CLONE_NEWPID, the hierarchy is
topped with one additional newly created pid namespace.  This
is the only pid namespace in which the new process will be able
to see processes, while it will be visible in all namespaces in
its pidns hierarchy.
A pid namespace cannot be unshared.
