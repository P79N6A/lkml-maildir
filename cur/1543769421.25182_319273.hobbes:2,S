I don't really understand it.
A reference count usually means, the number of references (pointers)
to an object.  You can sometimes get away with schemes that deviate
from this in various ways, but it's usually asking for trouble.
The usage in mark_mounts_for_expiry() deviated from it so much, that
the result was a subtle race.
Doing some tricky thing like what you propose will just likely
introduce more subtle problems.
