Grepping in 2.6.7-rc2 shows that nobody #include's several files
include/linux/802_11.h
include/linux/acpi_serial.h
include/linux/adb_mouse.h
include/linux/atapi.h
include/linux/fsfilter.h
include/linux/in_systm.h
include/linux/isdn_lzscomp.h
include/linux/mpp.h
include/linux/netbeui.h
include/linux/netfilter_ddp.h
include/linux/netfilter_ipx.h
include/linux/netfilter_x25.h
Should something from this list stay in kernel?
Alexey
