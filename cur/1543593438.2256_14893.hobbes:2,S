I have performance problems with a CUV4X-DLS (VIA-694XDP) dual
processor motherboard. It's a web server. vmstat shows it
does 10000-15000 context switches/s and load average stays
aroung 20 all the time. I tried two other machines (a VAlinux UP
and supermicro MP) with the same load, memory, SCSI controller,
etc. (but different eth) and they run with a load average
of 0.5-1 and 1000-2000 cs/s.
Bye.
