Well, I don't think so...
I don't like it if there is a possibility doing it with an initializer, but in 
other cases it may increase readability, too...
There was a discussion about SET_MODULE_OWNER here on the list, once.
You can find it here:

At the end Rusty made a small patch that never made it into the mainline tree 
(even if I think it should have...) His mail with the patch can be found at:
     http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105065084724249&w=2
(I like the analogy to a mainframe ;-)
