That's obsolete then. With local_t you don't need to turn off interrupts
anymore.

I think the right fix for those is to just change the fallback local_t
to disable interrupts again - that should be a better tradeoff and
when they have a better alternative they can implement it in the arch.
(in fact i did a patch for that too, but considered throwing it away
again because I don't have a good way to test it)
