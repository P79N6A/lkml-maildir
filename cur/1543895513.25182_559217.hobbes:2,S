I think GPLv3 has that covered:
  Network access may be denied when the modification itself materially
  and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the
  rules and protocols for communication across the network.
I've been sufficiently annoyed by credit card transactions that cannot
be completed for network-down reasons that I believe such devices
depend on network access to perform the original purpose, and even
though IANAL I think that cutting off network access in case the
software no longer complies with the regulations is permitted by the
license.

If the above is not enough, you could always use ROM.  Sure, if you
can replace the ROM, so can the user, and this just goes to show how
short-sighted the alleged prohibitions on user tinkering with the
software are.  Sure, it would be more costly, but it's not like the
law (or the agreements in place) *mandate* tivoization.
