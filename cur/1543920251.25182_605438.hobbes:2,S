FWIW, I have marked the kjournald processes on my system
realtime with "rtprio -c 1 `pidof kjournald`" and the
usual desktop stalls that plague my system have not yet
happened this afternoon.

The big problem I have seen here is that processes end up
waiting on kjournald to do something, and kjournald is
waiting due to the IO scheduler.
This can cause a lot of low IO (high IO priority) processes
to indirectly get stuck behind a few high IO (low priority)
processes.
Since you have been involved a lot with ext3 development,
which kinds of workloads do you think will show a performance
degradation with Arjan's patch?   What should I test?
