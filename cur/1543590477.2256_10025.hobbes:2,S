I see. It's not a pure PCI driver. I wonder what happens if some other
driver becomes "impure" e.g. by adding PCMCIA support.

First part (writing the patch) is done:
http://www.red-bean.com/~proski/linux/trident_pm.diff
I only know that it compiles. I have no hardware I can test it on. Please
don't apply until tested!
