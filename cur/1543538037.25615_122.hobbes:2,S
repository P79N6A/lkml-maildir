Ladies and Gentlemen:
The APM module has caused a solid lockup every time it is invoked.  This
lockup is complete -- the <ALT><SysReq> keys have no effect.  Subsequent
fsck always has illegal blocks, at least two with multiple references,
not just the normal 0 dtime stuff.  Looks like the drive is stopping
before any writes happen (sync, suspend to disk, et. al.), but this is
just a guess.
APM code last worked for me in 2.4.0-test1-ac20 (did not test 21) but
ac22 and test2 have the problem.
I have an Inspiron 7K, 333 MHz celeron.  Following .config has not
changed since before 2.3.48 and worked fine then:
CONFIG_APM=m
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE is not set
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE=y
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT=y
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS=y
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
Pls cc me off-list.
Thanx,
David A. Bandel
