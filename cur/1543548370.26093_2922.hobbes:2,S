I was planning on having using a Linux syscall rather than an interrupt, since
the int ties it to i386.

It does and it doesn't is the answer I think. NT/Win2000 certainly does
not... kernel32.dll renders the Win32 calls into "Native API" calls, which are
defined in ntdll.dll. These use "int 0x2e" to obtain access to the kernel, but
are mostly undocumented (typically).
As for Win95/98/ME, I would have thought these would implement the Win32
syscalls directly.
