semaphore is a bit awkward for this (I have implemented it for this type
of purpose and it really feels like a hack).
How can this be implemented with futex??  Let me make another scenario.
If you have a task sleeping and it needs to be woken when some other
task needs it (kind of like a kthread) but it doesn't know what task
will wake it.  A futex is like a mutex where it has one owner, so you
can sleep till the owner awakes it, but you don't know who the owner is.
I really like the way the kernel has the wake_up_process function, and
it is vary handy to have for even user space.  Right now the most common
way to do it is semaphores (yuck!) or signals.  Both are very heavy and
I don't really see why a new interface can't be introduced.  Yes, it
breaks portability, but it if becomes a standard, then others  will port
to it (and maybe it will become a new POSIX standard :)
