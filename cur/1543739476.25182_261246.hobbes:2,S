Hi all,
I'm not able to get 2.6.9rc4mm1U4 booted up, it seems to get stuck 
spitting out endless messages when the bootup process gets to the 
reiserfs check stage.  U3 seemed to get out of this mode in just a few 
seconds.
If KGDB works with this, I can try to get a log of these messages Monday 
if that will help.
Back to playing with U3 for me for now.
John G.
