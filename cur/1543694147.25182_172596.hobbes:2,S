I don't know, I didn't code it :) I discovered it a few months ago while I
was doing some portable code to measure the maximum stack growth of our
software. I was doing something like:
	memset(%esp - SAFE, 'S', SIZE);
and it was puking on me on both Linux and Windows. An alloca+memset solved
the problem in both environments.
