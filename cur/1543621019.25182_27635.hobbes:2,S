IMO, the SuS definition sucks.  We really do want to do our best to
ensure that pending writes are committed to disk before sys_sync()
returns.  As long as that doesn't involve waiting until mid-August.
For example, ext3 users get to enjoy rebooting with `sync ; reboot -f'
to get around all those silly shutdown scripts.  This very much relies
upon the sync waiting upon the I/O.
I mean, according to SUS, our sys_sync() implementation could be
asmlinkage void sys_sync(void)
{
	return;
}
Because all I/O is already scheduled, thanks to kupdate.
But we want sync to be useful.

If shutdown hangs, it's probably due to something else.
