What norton does is simply use a few characters that happen to look like a
mouse cursor on characters (or norton forces to look, more correctly). You
can do that for a single object (like the mouse cursor), and a few more,
but of course you can display much less characters that way than with a
standard method, as it eats 4 characters/object.
