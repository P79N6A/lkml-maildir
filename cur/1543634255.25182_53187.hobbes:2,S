But since it is the kernel that permits that (by
definition, since somebody has to check the UID & GID!
:) then the kernel can also restrict that.
The system admin account (UID/GID 0) could just as
easily access a virtual memory map, virtual I/O ports,
etc, with the kernel then handling how that maps onto
the physical world, and even IF it does.

The problem with priviliged tasks is that (in general)
they run with absolute privilige. Sure, some of these
priviliges can be turned off, but if /dev/mem is
reachable, then they can be turned back on again,
precicely for the reasons you give.
I guess that my understanding for having kernels the
size and complexity of Linux, as opposed to, say,
CP/M, is that the kernel can reduce the need for
userspace apps to have dangerous powers.
