Andrew,
These data are used in CSA Accounting today and i believe ELSA
intends to use them also.
Since PAGG is not in the tree, SGI have been offering our customers
PAGG/JOB/CSA kernel code as either kernel patches at oss.sgi.com
site or out-of-tree kernel modules today.
SGI intends to submit another solution for PAGG/JOB soon.
Once the future of PAGG/JOB becomes clear, we will know better how
to integrate CSA and BSD accounting. We are not sitting on it.
Thanks,
  - jay
