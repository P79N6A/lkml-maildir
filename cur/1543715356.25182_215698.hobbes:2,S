You don't - just brute-force the tcp 4-tuple and sequence number. The
attack relies on the fact that you don't have to match sequence number
exactly, which cuts down on the search-space. (If total search space is
2^32, rwin is 16k, effective attack search space is 2^32/16k). Multiplied 
by number of ephemeral ports, it becomes *feasible* but still not very 
likely.

Yep.
