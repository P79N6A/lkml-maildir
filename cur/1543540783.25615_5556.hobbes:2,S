It occurs to me that I could really use some sort of enumeration function
in the linux kernel.  That is, a function that I could call which would
give me a unique number for enumerating devices.
Of course, if I could use it, then someone else could probably use it, and
perhaps someone has allready written it!
The function would probably look something like this:
struct enumerate {
  int num;
  struct semaphore lock;
}
int enum(struct enumerate * foo)
{
  volatile val;
  down(foo->lock);
  val = foo->num;
  foo->num++;
  up(foo->lock);
  return val;
}
This function could be implemented much more effeciently in assembly, much
like the atomic_inc() function, but with a return code.
Does such a function allready exist in the linux-kernel?

I could always suspend a few hundred accounts and watch what happens.
