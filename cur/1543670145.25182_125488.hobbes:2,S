Ok, NOW we are talking ;-)

But the read can read garbage and may need a retry. This is not
acceptable for me, since one of my cards will do destructive
reads. They implement a hardware FIFO (of one element depth),
where the register I read from is removing the element while
reading. This is a common design you'll find in PCI-bridge chips
(I used the S5933 from AMCC for this).
So this scheme still doesn't help me and is not the proper
drop-in replacement, we are looking for.
BTW: Please note, that you can assume I know the semantics of all
   the locking functions currently in Linus' tree. So you can
   stop explaining me the details of them and continue with
   defining a proper cli/sti replacement. Thanks!

Yes, but it doesn't solve the problem, that I've illustrated. You'll not
know, WHEN this scheduled work will trigger (kernel tells us: ASAP)
and you need another kernel thingie again. And you must check,
whether the deadline is over yourself.
This isn't that nice design. I just don't feel that experienced,
that I can change the scheduler.
But maybe we can talk about that now, that we both know that we
know the current kernel API well enough ;-)
