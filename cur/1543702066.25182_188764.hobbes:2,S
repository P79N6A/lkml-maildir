The "unmarked hardware" is why we have PCI quirks. Look at 
drivers/pci/quirks.c, and notice how many of the quirks are all about 
quirk_io_region().  Exactly because there isn't any way for the BIOS to 
tell us about these things on the IO side.
(Actually, there is: PnP-BIOS calls are supposed to give us that
information. However, not only are the BIOSes buggy and don't give a
complete list _anyway_, anybody who uses the PnP-BIOS is much more likely
to just get a kernel oops when the BIOS is buggy and assumes that only
Windows will call it. So I strongly suggest you not _ever_ use pnp unless
you absolutely have to).
The same quirks could be done on the MMIO side for northbridges.
