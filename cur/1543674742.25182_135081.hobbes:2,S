I somewhat agree with you but this "properly described" are all the bug 
reports on lkml containing "bad interactivity in 2.5, cpu starving in 2.5" 
and such...
This isn't a shenanigan, at least not for the interactivity for a desktop. 
This is a workaround for users who are complaining about bad interactivity in 
2.5!
