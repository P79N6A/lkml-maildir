des is a 56-bit cipher with 8 bits of parity.  This means that the
user-land software needs to make sure that the 64-bit key given has
the correct parity.  Unfortunately, losetup doesn't do this.  I've
received a patch that fixes this, but in the mean time, you could try
any of the other ciphers - they should work as they don't have the
quirks that DES has.
