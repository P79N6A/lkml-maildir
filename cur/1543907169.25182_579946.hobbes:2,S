kmalloc is the hardest thing to get right, there are also functions to
calculate the reserves for kmem_cache like allocations, see
kmem_estimate_pages().

No, do see patch 2/10. What we do is we fail cpuset local allocations,
_except_ PF_MEMALLOC (or __GFP_MEMALLOC). These will break out of the
mempolicy bounds before dipping into the reserves.
This has the effect that all nodes will be low before we hit the
reserves. Also, given that PF_MEMALLOC will usually use only a little
amount of memory the impact of breaking out of these bounds is quite
limited.
