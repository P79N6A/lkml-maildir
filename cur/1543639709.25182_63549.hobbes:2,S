This is quite a bad idea.
If we go after the hostname, things like Puretec or our Hawkeye will be 
shot. Imagine the domain ngforever.de. It's hosted on kundenserver.de, and 
the smtp host is smtp.kundenserver.de. How can we guess?!
If we go after MX entries, most people will be shot. T-Online, Yahoo, 
Netscape... all have different smarthosts for users and incoming mail. 
T-Online, for example, has mailin00 through mailin07.sul.t-online.de for 
the incoming messages, while users use fwd00 through 
fwd07.sul.t-online.com in order to send mail.
We'll break things either way. I send mail via hawkeye.lightweight.adm 
(not an internet address, but the realname, and yes, it's a large 
network.) for the domain lightweight.ods.org, where's the connection? In 
order to find out that hawkeye.lightweight.adm is the mail host of 
lightweight.ods.org you'll have to ask a domain server on our side. 
However, Hawkeye signs things with his realname.
