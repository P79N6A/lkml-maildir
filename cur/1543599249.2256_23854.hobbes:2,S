hi all,
i'm looking to do something stupid.  can anyone tell me why it won't
work? (is there some kind of special protection on EXE memory pages?)
i have an application, App1, that has a 64KB function (64KB of NOP)
"void funcX(void)".  App1 opens a socket to another application, App2,
which is going to feed code to App1 to stick in funcX.
that is, i've got some other set of functions i plan on feeding to App1
and they're all going to look like "funcX" to App1.  those functions are
coming from App2, which is chewing on a bunch of var-things to spit out 
just the right code for App1.
now, when i try to do this, i get Random Stuff.  sometimes, i just get
a segfault.  sometimes, it seems to work, but the memory at funcX is
hosed if i do a hex-dump compared to what i received from App2.  either
way, it isn't doing what i want...
is there some trick here to make this work?  or am i SOL?
[is there a better place to ask this question?]
thanks,
josh
