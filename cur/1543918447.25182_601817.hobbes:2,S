Subject: Root on drbd and /etc on a cd-rw: What do you think about that?

Hello list,
As i want lvm on drbd and drbd for the whole disk, exclusive /boot, i needed
to find a way to keep two nearly identical /etc-directories.
This lead to the idea to put the /etc-directory on a cd-rw and let / be
handled completely via drbd/lvm.
Because the /etc-files are only read seldom, mostly only on startup, i don't
think, this is a real performance-impact, isn't it?
And a cd-rw delivers the possibility for me to make changes and safe them
again...
What do you think about that?
Another possibility would be using an USB-stick for each, but i had bad
experiences on some systems in activating usb 2.0 on startup, this was often
so slow, that the kernel "didn't find" the disk while booting...
Kind regards, Florian
