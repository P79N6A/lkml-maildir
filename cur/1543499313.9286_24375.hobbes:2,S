I dont think devfs *requires* to be mounted on /dev ...
Someone correct me if im wrong.
1) If you want a physical /dev on the disk with 40,000 entries, disable
   the devfs compile option and create your physical /dev directory and
   populate it with 40,000 entries and all is well.
2) If you want a physical /dev dynamically populated by a userspace
   daemon, then compile devfs in, mount it on /devices and have a
   userspace daemon populate /dev and all is well.
3) If you want a fully dynamic devfs mounted on /dev, then compile it in
   and mount it on /dev and all is well.
Any questions?
