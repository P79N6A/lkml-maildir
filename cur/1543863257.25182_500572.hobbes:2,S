Hi Linus, Thomas, all,
It appears that kernel.org is hosting two git repositories with the
history of the linux kernel development, up to 2.6.12-rc2, which was
originally in bitkeeper. The first one is owned by Linus:
http://www2.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git;a=summary
The second one is owned by Thomas:
http://www2.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git;a=summary
As both trees serve the same purpose, I was thinking that we could have
a single copy. I see two benefits in doing so:
* Thomas' version is better as far as I can see (it has the author
  names which are missing from Linus' version for example) but I
  suspect most people don't know about it and use Linus' version,
  as I have been doing myself until very recently.
* It might help lower the load on the kernel.org servers (by increasing
  the cache hits.)
So I suggest that Linus deletes his old-2.6-bkcvs tree. What do you
think?
Thanks,
