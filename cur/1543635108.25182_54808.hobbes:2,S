Good day,
There has been a while since any IDE patches have gone into main tree.
Also, it's been a while since Martin Dalecki released an IDE patch.
Where is he? In lat two weeks or so only Bartolmej (did I spell this
correctly?) has been releasing them. Could anyone elaborate?
Regards,
Grega Fajdiga
