I am not sure if my question was clear enough or I couldnt interpret you 
answer correctly.(If it was the case I apologise for that).
My question is, as I said I am measuring the schedule time difference 
between my 2 of my SCHED_FIFO process in schedule() .But, I get only one set 
of readings (i.e., schedule() is being called once which implies my process 
is being scheduled only once and run till completion)
Also, as I said my interrupts are being processed during this time.I 
inspected /proc/interrupts for this.So, my question was if interrupts heve 
been processed several times the 2 SCHED_FIFO process which has been 
interrupted must have been resecheduled several times and for this upon 
returning from the interrupt handler the schedule() function must have been 
called  several times to schedule the 2 process which were running.But, as I 
said I get only one reading??
From your reply, I come to understand that when an interrupt interrupts my 
user process.....it runs straight way ....but upon return from the interrupt 
handler does it not call schedule() to again resume my interrupted process? 
Please help.
Thanks
