And we cannot lock the page because, err, we need to run sync_page() for
that.

But the page can come unlocked and truncate or page reclaim can remove the
page from the mapping and memory reclaim can reclaim the inode:
	int block_sync_page(struct page *page)
	{
		struct address_space *mapping;
		smp_mb();
		mapping = page_mapping(page);
-> right here
		if (mapping)
-> go boom here		blk_run_backing_dev(mapping->backing_dev_info, page);
		return 0;
	}
But I cannot think of any callers of sync_page() who don't have a ref on
the inode, so...
