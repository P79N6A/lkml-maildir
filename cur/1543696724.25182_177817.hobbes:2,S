Well I got a hold of the necessary cabling and I'm sorry to report that
there is absolutely nothing on the serial console - I get the boot
messages, etc. fine, the last message before crashing is 'Loglevel set to
9' [invoked by hand via Alt+SysRq+9], after which I crash it with 'strace
ls -lR /' (as a normal user) and nothing else shows up, no oops no nada.  
After it crashed I attempted different Alt+SysRq combos (H/T/M/P/S/U) with
no effect as well - even the help didn't show.  This is still via the
keyboard (not sure how to send a sysrq via serial), although I'm almost
sure now that it wouldn't help - the system is just plain totally 
and completely dead, even the system bios is likely dead - including the 
System Management Mode code (likely responsible for lighting up the LED 
on fn key press/release, which no longer works [although not on every 
crash]).
Cheers,
MaZe.
