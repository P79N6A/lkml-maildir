Linus accepted it for 2.6, does it need to be blessed by the Pope, or what?

Now that is bullshit and you know it! This is not a pet feature, this
is code which has has been stable for years. There just aren't any
other candidates, all the other FS stuff went in with less testing and
have fewer users now (JFS as example). This is also not code offered
"right before a freeze" this code has been offered version by version
for two bleepin' years, has it not? There's no slippery slope, there
are no other major features which have proven long-term stability. Fell
free to name them if I'm wrong...
Marcelo admits he doesn't like the coding style, he has the right to
keep out anything he doesn't like, but let's not invent other reasons.
It's his call and he made it. It's a pity he didn't make the call
earlier and save people the effort, though.
