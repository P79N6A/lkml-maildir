Maybe you could handle this with a PCI quirk that runs before
pci_enable_device().  IIRC, we considered exposing a separate
interface for PCI IRQ allocation and routing, but decided it
wasn't worth the complexity since so few devices would need it.

There are good reasons to wait to allocate the IRQ until you have
a driver that cares about the device.  I'm sorry that this broke
your specific case.
