Let's see now.. I don't have scsi, I don't isdn or pcmcia. All that radio
stuff is useless to me as well. Hoe much can we save from the kernel by
cutting all this out?
Lines of code only affects the size if it is compiled into the kernel
(assuming I _did_ get it right that we are talking about kernel size and
not tar ball size), so it's a bit silly argument to use, don't you think?
What would be nice (from the tar ball point of view) would be to
modularize the kernel sources so that they can be downloaded separetly (I
know I misspelled it), but I can easily imagine the horror trying to keep
that up to date and working properly. Not very likely, but would be nice.
