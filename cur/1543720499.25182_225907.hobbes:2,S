So Ia64 does have it..that's good. Does glibc wrap it?
I agree with the above...could glibc's clone() should have a size added? 
Then the arch specific stack issues
could be hidden.
BTW, does gcc have a built-in #define like __STACK_GROWSUP__ that would 
allow one to deal with the missing size parameter
when you called clone() by adjusting what you passed with and #ifdef?.
