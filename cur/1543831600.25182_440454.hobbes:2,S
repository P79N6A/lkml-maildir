That's my guess as well.  It probably has a different GPIO configuration
than the other AX88772 devices.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to
find out what that configuration is.  A USB trace of the Windows driver
initializing the device would be extremely helpful to determine what is
necessary.  I've tried to contact DLink, but it seems to get in depth
technical info like that may take a lot of work.
