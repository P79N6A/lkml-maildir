Subject: [PATCH RFC] Input: tell mousedev to handle remote console virtual mice using absolute coordinates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Devices like the HP Integrated Remote Console Virtual Mouse, which are
standard equipment on all Proliant and Integrity servers, produce
absolute coordinates instead of relative coordinates.  This is done to
synchronize the position of the mouse cursor on the client desktop
with the mouse cursor position on the server.  Mousedev is not
designed to pass those absolute events directly to X, but it can
translate them into relative movements.  It currently does this for
tablet like devices and touchpads.  This patch merely tells it to also
include a device with ABS_X, ABS_Y, and mouse buttons in its list of
devices to process input for.
This patch enables the mouse pointer to move when using the remote
console.  Without this patch, the cursor will not move.

I understand that Dell DRAC and Sun Andromeda are or contain a similar
device, one which produces absolute X,Y coordinates and ordinary mouse
clicks.  This patch may also enable these but I have no access to
these systems.
