Only issue would be the alignment restriction on blockdev versus raw device.
raw allows 512 byte alignment on userbuff, offset and length.
blockdevice might need  1024/2048 byte alignment.
If we get the alignment patch for DIO, this is not an issue.
(alignment patch - in case of defualt alignment problem,
go down to blkdev_hardsect_size() alignment.)
