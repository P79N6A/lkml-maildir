Subject: [RFC] - Schedule mcdx for removal ? was:  warning: #warning You have not edited mcdx.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

anyway - i wonder if anybody is ever using 2.6.21+ on a system with one of 
those legacy mitsumi single-speed (LU-005/FX-001) and double-speed (FX-001D) 
cd-rom drives !?
iirc, these where the first drives available on the market (must have been 
around '94) and those were no ide/atapi compatible drives which had their 
own isa-bus controller.
i wonder if there still exist any of those devices in functional state in 
this world, at least not attached to some system being able to boot 
2.6.21+ - so, maybe mcdx driver is something for 
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt , being removed in 2.6.25 or so 
after being announced for some time (i.e. driver telling "i will be gone 
soon, go spend those $15 to get a new drive") ?
not 100% sure here, but there really may be nobody to complain about 
removing this one.....
regards
roland
ps:
hey, i just read discussions about removing RAW driver, so if THAT being 
discussed for removal, this one probably should have been removed already ! 
;)
