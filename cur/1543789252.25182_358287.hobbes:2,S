sure see alpha:
	__asm__ __volatile__(
	"1:	ldq_l %0,%1\n"
	"	addq %0,%3,%2\n"
	"	addq %0,%3,%0\n"
	"	stq_c %0,%1\n"
	"	beq %0,2f\n"
	"	mb\n"
the memory barrier is applied way after the write is visible to other
cpus, you can even get an irq before the mb and block there for some
usec.
From a common code point of view, the barrier you mentioned in
atomic_add_negative is absolutely useless for this specific case
(setpagedirty+put_page)
