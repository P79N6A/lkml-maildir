I get the following error trying to compile 2.5.69.  This is the same config as 2.5.68, make with 'make oldconfig' and 'make bzlilo && make modules modules_install'.
Config and config.old attached.
Error:

arch/i386/oprofile/init.c:25: `ENODEV' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/i386/oprofile/init.c:25: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
