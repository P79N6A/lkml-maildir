Subject: [PATCH] fix ATM build with O=

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Chas,
I noticed today, while trying to build with the O= make option (which
allows the objects to be in a different directory than the source), that
ATM throws a warning. Turns out there is an explicit dependency on where
include is. But, with O=, include only contains asm-offsets.s and
include2 contains the appropriate files.
Here is a first attempt at a fix... Ideally, I could just check
KBUILD_OUTPUT's value (which should be set with O= or the
environmental variable KBUILD_OUTPUT). But I couldn't get that to work
(can try again with some guidance, though). Instead, I just check if the
source and object trees are different -- which I think can only be the
case if you use O= or KBUILD_OUTPUT. I think the change from $(src) to
$(obj) is also correct...
Description: Fix the build process for ATM when the make command-line
option O= is used. The current code assumes the files will be availabled
in the src directory (not the case with O=) and that include is the
directory to look in (not the case with O=). I would prefer to use
KBUILD_OUTPUT, but was unable to get it working.
