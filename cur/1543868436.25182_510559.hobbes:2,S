How about this?
Solves the FUSE deadlock, but not the throttle_vm_writeout() one.
I'll try to tackle that one as well.
If the per-bdi dirty counter goes below 16, balance_dirty_pages()
returns.
Does the constant need to tunable?  If it's too large, then the global
threshold is more easily exceeded.  If it's too small, then in a tight
situation progress will be slower.
Thanks,
Miklos
