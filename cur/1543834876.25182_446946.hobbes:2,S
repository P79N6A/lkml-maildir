Do you see the same drift when you lock date on a single CPU
with taskset?

No because even one second a week will break timing badly
over time. 
I believe the only good solution unless hardware helps would
be to use per CPU TSC offsets as discussed earlier. Even that
is a bit risky because there can be still very small drifts,
but they should be limited by a clock tick error max and
might work out.
