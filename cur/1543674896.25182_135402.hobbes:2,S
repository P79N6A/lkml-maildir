If it isn't specific to SCSI, then it sure as hell shouldn't BE THERE!
My point is that it's _wrong_ to make non-SCSI drivers use the SCSI layer, 
because that shows that something is misdesigned.
And I bet there isn't all that much left that really helps.
You adding more "pseudo-SCSI" crap just _makes_things_worse. It does not 
advance anything, it regresses.
