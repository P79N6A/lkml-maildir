I have a better patch than the one I gave you (attached below).  If you
send me a mail with steps to reproduce your remaining problems I'll put
this very high on my TODO list after christmas.  Btw, any chance you could
try XFS CVS (which is at 2.6.9) + the patch below instead of plain 2.6.9,
there have been various other fixes in the last months.
