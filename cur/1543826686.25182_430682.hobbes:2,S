To clarify the above a bit more, there is one regression in GFS2 in the
current -mm tree that needs to be fixed. Since Linus has announced
2.6.17-rc6, there is now in fact time for that to happen, so that we
will be ready to merge for 2.6.18. Sorry for any confusion my earlier
comment might have caused,
Steve.
