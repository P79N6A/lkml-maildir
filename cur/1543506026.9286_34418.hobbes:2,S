This is before my time, but I believe the original intent was that
deleted files would be preserved for some length of time - space
reclaimed only when needed or when they got "old enough" - so you
could undelete things without having to grovel through the raw disk.
That was never implemented as far as I know.  See NetWare for a
similar idea.
Interestingly, there *is* no special handling of dtime in ext2fs: it's
set and the inode is marked dirty just like any other inode update.
So why is it, I wonder, that fsck always complains about deleted
inodes with zero dtime but rarely if ever about other inode
inconsistencies?
