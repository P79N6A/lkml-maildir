not to belabor this, but what does it mean when the two dependencies
are mutually exclusive, as in the example i provided:
-----------------------
config MCA
        bool "MCA support"
        depends on !(X86_VISWS || X86_VOYAGER)
        help
          MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
          laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
          <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
          there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.
config MCA
        depends on X86_VOYAGER
        default y if X86_VOYAGER
---------------------
  the two options X86_VISWS and X86_VOYAGER are simple "bool"s
representing the (radio-box) subarchitecture type.
  the first seems to represent a dependency of *neither* of those
two listed options, while the second config *depends* on one of 
them.  
  how exactly do you reconcile what looks like contradictory
dependencies for the same config entry?
rday,
wondering just how badly he's embarrassing himself by now ...
