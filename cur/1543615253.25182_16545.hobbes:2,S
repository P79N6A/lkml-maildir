Yeah, I was going to get around to submitting a patch to change the
SCSI host allocation code to use devfs_alloc_unique_number(), but
right now that function is only functional if CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y
(otherwise you get a stub function which returns -1). So really this
should be turned into a generic function, which was my plan all along,
but I didn't want to fight that battle back then. Now that it's in
the tree, I can look at doing this.
Comments? Got a suggestion for which file the generic function should
go into? I figure on stripping the leading "devfs_" part of the
function names.
