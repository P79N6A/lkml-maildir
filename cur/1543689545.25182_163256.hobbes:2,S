Those 99+% are going to use a distro. A popular Linux distro
is a rough equivalent of a Windows install disk in terms of
ease of use, feature set and intended audience.
Distro can handle this problem (of driver ABI or absence thereof)
in any way it wants. I can imagine it can even go to the great pains
and introduce binary driver ABI. But unlikely.
OTOH I believe core kernel folks will not accept your proposal.
Stay a bit longer on lkml and you will understand why.
