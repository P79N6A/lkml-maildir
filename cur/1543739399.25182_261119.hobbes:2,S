It is doable in theory, but in practice mdadm is too retarded (I'm taliking
about mdadm 1.6.0 here). Its man page says:
    mdadm can perform (almost) all of its functions  without  having  a
    configuration  file  and  does  not use one by default.
I guess "almost" is the key. Firstly, it collapses with any attempt to run
"mdadm -A -s" or any variation of such, because it's full of places like
this.
	mddev_ident_t array_ident = conf_get_ident(configfile, dv->devname);
	mdfd = open_mddev(dv->devname, array_ident->autof);
Obviously, array_ident is NULL if a config file is not present. It is
possible to fool the stupid thing by giving it a dummy config file,
like this one:
DEVICE partitions
ARRAY /dev/md0
It still won't scan, aborting with this:
mdadm: /dev/dasda has no superblock - assembly aborted
The ChangeLog looks as if someone tried to make it work, but I observe
it didn't go very far.
