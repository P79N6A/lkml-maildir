If this is the test8 "turn off ORIG_EAX if EIP is changed" fix, it apparently 
also broke a couple of other ptrace-intensive things which aren't coming to 
mind (Andi Kleen noticed them).
AFAIK, it was never explained.  Something would change its victim's EIP and 
the victim would segfault as soon as it was continued.
