I was trying to do one logical thing at a time with this driver as I did
not have the hardware to test, and I could not even build the code at
the time.
In looking more closer, I think the 084 patch might still work properly,
but I can't guarantee it as the the default kobject parent might not be
pointing to the correct attribute at the time.  I know 085 fixes this to
be sure that it will work properly.
It helped in reviewing this code by the other s390 developers to have
this in at least 2 pieces, to try to untangle the mess of sysfs files,
ksets, and other attrocities that you all have grown into over the
years.
So again, I'm sorry if this happens to break your run-time tests when
doing a 'git bisect', but as I explicitly stated it did in the patch, I
think everyone is properly forwarned :)
This core rework was tough to do, there was a reason no one had done it
before.  Now it is cleaner, smaller, able to be understood by at least
one active kernel developer, if not more, and it's documented, with
working examples.  If the downside of this effort is only this one thing
(note that others are finally finding real bugs...) I'll be very happy.
thanks,
