Hi,
Is it possible to download a drive firmware to a fibre channel
drive (or even a scsi drive) through linux ? I know that on
NT (or 98) they use WNASPI and a utility provided by the 
drive manufacturer to download the firmware. I was wondering
if this is possible through linux scsi interface. For FC,
I have Qlogic Fibre Channel card.
Thanks and regards,
-hiren
