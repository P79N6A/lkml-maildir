You didn't enable ACPI, it's needed for almost all systems to detect HT 
and also for many systems to detect multi-cores as well.
Aside from that, in general I would say that on any modern x86 system 
ACPI should always be enabled. In many cases it seems the BIOS code is 
not tested much without ACPI anymore, so going without ACPI can be 
problematic.
