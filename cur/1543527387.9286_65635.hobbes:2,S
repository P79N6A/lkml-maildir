See my patch posted under subject "Tulip driver overhaul" which was also
sent to Linus [separately]
Short term, what should really be done is something like
	outl_csr6() {
		if (chip != xircom)
			outl(data)
			return
		...ugly xircom-specific locking and such...
	}
The lock should not even be held for most adapters.  (Linus pointed out
that even my version, as posted to lkml and sent to him, is still ugly
because of said locking)
However, the REAL solution is to completely audit this driver for SMP. 
eepro100 should be a good model, and 8139too after 2.3.48-pre2 (or
whatever) is released.
