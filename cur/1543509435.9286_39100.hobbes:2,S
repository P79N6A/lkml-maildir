AFAIK, those cards are _not_ standing for parallel working but routing
interface, so I can't see advantage on using different IRQ here
in some monolithic approach.IMHO 2 solutions are viable here: 
	1.Four modules with disparate IRQ per segment
	  (where btw you'll have to face hardware collisions)
	  (I gonna be flamed with this one ...for sure : ) ).
	2.One big big module with 1 IRQ for the whole interfaces.

Could you be more specific on which basic handler to be used ?
