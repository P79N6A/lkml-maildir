You miss the whole point of dual licencing:
Sam has stated in the licence that the code can be distributed under the 
terms of the BSD licence, or alternatively it can be distributed under 
the terms of the GPLv2.
Noone removed Sam's licence.
Sam has offered a choice, and if you choose one of the two offered 
licences when distributing his code that complies with what he stated
in his copyright notice.
IANAL, but if reyk contributed to dual licenced code keeping the file 
dual licenced it's hard to argue that he did not make the changes he 
made available dual licenced.

The funny thing is that it seems Jiri's patch contained copyright 
violations - and the parts of his patch Theo attacks are the parts
that are OK...
