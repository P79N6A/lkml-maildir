Of course, they'll always be bugs. They'll still slip past the release,
as many are doing today.

Don't know. However, I think that core bugs have more impact on the rest
than other bugs. Reason to merge core first.

no, this is exactly what *not* to do. Linus is right about the risk of
getting more stuff at once. If we merge less things, we *must* be able
to speed up the process. Half the patches to cross-check in half the
time should be easier than all patches in full time. The time to fix
a problem within N patches is O(N^2).

You're perfectly right and that's exactly not what I'm proposing. BTW,
having two halves will also get more of the merge job done the side of
developers, where testing is being done before submission. So in the
end, we should also get *less* regressions caused by each submission.

again, this cannot work because this would result in slowing them down,
and it's not what I'm proposing.
