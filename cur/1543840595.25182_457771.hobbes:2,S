Hmm... from what I see, data structure user_beancounter is _not_ defined
for a single resource, it is a beancounter for _all_ resources.
struct user_beancounter
{
	atomic_t		ub_refcount;
	spinlock_t		ub_lock;
	uid_t			ub_uid;
	struct hlist_node	hash;
	struct user_beancounter	*parent;
	void			*private_data;
	/* resources statistics and settings */
	struct ubparm		ub_parms[UB_RESOURCES];
};
ub_parms of _all_ controllers are held in this data structure.
So, keeping the beancounter data structure inside _a_ controller
specific data structure doesn't sound right to me, as other controllers
might also have the same need ?!
Controller _owns_ only ub_parms[controller_id], not the whole
user_beancounter, right ?
