Hi all,
I remember there's a kernel pcmcia bug preventing the development for 
the Audigy2 pcmcia notebook sound card driver. 
See 
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=vendor-Creative_Labs#matrix
Is there any new updates on the situation? Has the bug been fixed? or
anyone working on it?
Thanks,
Raymond
