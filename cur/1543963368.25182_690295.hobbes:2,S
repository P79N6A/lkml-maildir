Interestingly, we once got a bunch of those and had a lot of problems
with them. Typically unbootable systems. We finally noticed that there
was a real corruption problem, because 3 MD5s of the kernel in a row
returned 3 different values. Our provider assured us that he never heard
about that, and insisted that we try again on a new batch. We have had
no trouble since. I guess we really got a bad batch. At least it was
noticeable early in the deployment process (the worst ones being a few
days after installation). However, we never had any problem with PQI
industrial.
