Christoph the "I2O" device is a communication processor. You need to
preserve the real scsi busses in order to get sane results from scsi
tools. If EH is implemented you'll need this to do controlled resets
(although this gets quite umm 'interesting' if using i2o_block also)
You've got
	I2O comms processor
		Multiple scsi busses
			Multiple drives
		Block driver providing abstract volumes
Sometimes (as with other raid) bypassing the block driver is faster.

All error timeout handling is done by the controller. It does really
need minimal EH handlers simply to reissue failed timed out commands.
