No, when the MTRRs are wrong they would generally not work fine.
As soon as something uses the uncached memory things go incredibly
slow, slow enough to make the machine unusable. Sometimes you're
lucky and nothing important is in there, but only sometimes.
There is also no code in there currently to automatically limit
the memory; the user has to do that with mem=...
But I also don't like the panic.
