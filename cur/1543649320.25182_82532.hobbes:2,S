atomic_t is problematic for debugging code which can be invoked by an
error from any state.  On parisc, atomic_add is implemented using load
and clear on a hash of the lock address, so it is possible to get
collisions on locks when doing atomic ops from debugging code.
Especially when the parisc code in 2.5.44 has exactly one hash table
entry.  kdb has the same problem and tries to avoid atomic_t for the
same reason, the current state is unreliable.
The dump_in_progress flag is set in one place and cleared in another.
All the other uses of dump_in_progress are testing its state.  If
atomic_t cannot be used safely, then it must be defined as volatile.
