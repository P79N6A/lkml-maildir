On most decent 144 and 288 floppies unless you have a disk inside all head move
requests are happily ignored by the drive. 
So resistanse is futile. 
So suggested is: On fdc error beep and wait before retry. Repeat after me: BEEP
and WAIT. Not like the floppy is very far from the speaker. 
Ah, and return -EAGAIN so that the vfs layer retries. On retry check the WAIT
status if not expired -EAGAIN. And make sure you do not f...k error routines for
real IO errors ;-)
Sorry for adding for this overabused thread but this is discussing fscked
hardware.  You have a limit on how much can you actually do in software to
compensate for the fact that the original ISA should be called not Industrial
Standard Architecture, but Idiotism Standard Architecture.
