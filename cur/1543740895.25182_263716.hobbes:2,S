You need the order there so someone can't allocate a huge amount
of memory and deplete all your reserves and crash the system.
For day to day running, it should barely make a difference because
the watermarks will be an order of magnitude larger.

AFAIKS, pages_min, pages_low and pages_high are all required for
what we want to be doing. I don't see you you could remove any one
of them and still have everything functioning properly....
