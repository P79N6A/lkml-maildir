Technical if and only if it did not remove the functionality of the
symbol when called.
Since it remove the ability to call and it work, creates a restriction of
usaged.  Usage being, one calls the function and it works.
I have not decided yet to expose one of the grossest example of API thieft
yet, but will do so in time.

Who cares, it reports a tainted and the community says, thank you have a

So when is the last time a business sent it problems to LKML to be
solved?  If I were a customer of such a company, I would be gone.

GPL_ONLY violate usage, thus it violate GPL.
Not a hard concept.
Also what if a company produces a "private gpl" product?
Open Source to customers but not to the world?
Nan, nobody would do that silly idea.

Stop, the laughing hurts "memory protection" "vm" ...
