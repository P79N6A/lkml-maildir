Hi,
Some hours ago I´ve  compiled the 2.2 pre7 kernel on a HP Kayak with
built in support  for  a pcnet32 and eepro100 network card.  The
eepro100 is connected to a cisco 100Mb switch.
If I boot the machine with the eepro100 plug to the switch, it dies at
boot while configuring the eth1 (eepro100) divice.  If I boot with the
tp cable unpluged and plug it after boot everithing works fine
Could be something with the drivers speed negociation?
The switch port is force to 100Mb
Thanks in advance
Flavio Pescuma
