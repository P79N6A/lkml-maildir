Subject: old problem, 2.0, slow on big machines until some (any) file is copied
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sorry to bother the list, especially since I know that this problem has
been discussed before, but I don't have a keyword to look for and how
to search the Internet without it?
I know I've read about exactly that problem some time ago. Description
is very fuzzy, if you don't recognize it immediately, ignore it, I've
too few hints for debugging, I hope for someone to point me to the
discussion that has already taken place (sometime, somewhere).
(Description is from a customer, fuzzy, but I knew immediately I had
seen it before)
Problem is, on big machines 2.0.(tested: 35|36) (DB-server) everything
is very slow (compared to smaller machines with exactly the same
setup), until a file is copied around, then everything works fine until
the next morning.
TIA
