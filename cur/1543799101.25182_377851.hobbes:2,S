You can io_submit() a list of IO_CMD_PREAD[V]s and immediately 
io_getevents() them. In addition to specifying different file offsets 
you can mix reads and writes, mix file descriptors, and reap nonblocking 
events quickly (by specifying a timeout of zero).
Sure, it's two syscalls instead of one, but it's much more flexibles, 
and databases should be using aio anyway. Oh, and no kernel changes 
needed, apart from merging vectored aio.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
