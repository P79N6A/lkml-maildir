Memory is cheap. NUMA people already replicate pages on big systems,
even the entire kernel. Last time I looked libc cost me under $1 a

Your cross instance communication some LPAR like setup is tiny, it
doesnt have to bounce over ethernet in that kind of setup that Larry
talks about - in many cases its probably doable as atomic ops in a
shared space

Why. If I want to explicitly allocated shared space I can allocate it
shared in a setup which is LPAR like. If its across a LAN then yes thats
a different kettle of fish.

I'd be suprised if that is an issue because large systems either run
lots of stuff so you can do the occasional move at fork time (which is
expensive) or customised setups. Most NUMA setups already mess around
with CPU binding to make the box fast
