That's a bus, not a class device.  Drivers bind to devices through a
bus.  That's why we have busses.

Hm, I don't really know...

Huh?  How would you do that?  Also, we really don't have different
driver "instances", so trying to represent something like that in sysfs
would probably be more work than it's worth.

Everything that's currently a platform device go to the root?  No,
that's not going to happen, sorry.

We do have a real platform "bus" that devices hang off of.  Where else
is that keyboard controller at :)
