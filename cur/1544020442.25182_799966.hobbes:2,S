(Up-to-date version of the pages can always be found online at the
location in the .sig.)
Well, the man page already had this text under notes:
       This  function  should  not  be  used  in  cases where multiple
       threads use random() and the behavior should  be  reproducible.
       Use random_r(3) for that purpose.
But it certainly doesn't hurt to have random_r(3) also listed under
the SEE ALSO, and I've added it for man-pages-3.18.
Cheers,
Michael
