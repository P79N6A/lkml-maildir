Other, existing mechanisms should prevent conflicts here.  If a builtin
SCSI driver loads successfully, then its calls to request_region,
request_mem_region, or pci_request_regions should have succeeded.
If so, any attempt to grab those I/O regions by another driver,
including another instance of the same driver, should fail.
