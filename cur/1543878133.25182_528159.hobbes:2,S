Yes sure, I didn't argue with that. However, "->exit_state = -1" does matter,
we can't detach process unless we make it auto-reap.

is enough. init is still our parent (make ps happy), but it can't see us,
we are not on ->children list.
Off course, we also need to add preparent_to_init() to kthread() and
(say) stopmachine(). Or we can create kernel_thread_detached() and
modify callers to use it.
