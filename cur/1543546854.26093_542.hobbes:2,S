This has the same effect as doing a 'setcd -l0' before mounting the CD-ROM disk.
But this way, it is never locked. I need to have the CD-ROM drive locked during
normal operation (ejecting the root filesystem is not very nice :) ), but
unlocked immediately before the reboot is done. 
I was unable to find a way to unlock the tray *after* the disk has been mounted.
Is there any or do I need to patch the kernel for the Gibraltar project (other
bootable CD-ROM projects will definitely need this too) ?
best greets,
Rene
