If you change the kernel interface, you also have to change the kernel
itself, at least if you introduce new syscalls.

I'd really love to see your code in get into the mainline kernel,
but I'd consider 32 bit host support an unnecessary burden for
long-term maintenance. Maybe you could maintain the 32 bit version
out of tree as long as there is still interest? I would expect that
at least the point where it works out of the box on x86_64
distros is when it becomes completely obsolete.
