The kernel allocates memory out using groups of blocks in a buddy
system. 128K is smaller than one of the blocks so the kernel cannot
handle this. You need 2MB (if I remember right) granularity for your
sections but nothing stops you marking most of the 2Mb section except
the 128K that exists as "in use"
