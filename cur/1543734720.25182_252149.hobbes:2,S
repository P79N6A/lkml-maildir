Hi,
Version 1.2.0 of libsysfs, shipped as part of the sysfsutils 
package is now available at 
	
http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net
Libsysfs provides a simple and stable API to access the sysfs 
filesystem.
Major changes since 1.1.0:
	- added dlist_sort_custom() for applications to 
		specify their list sorter routine.
		(Thanks to Eric Bohm)
	- minor documentation updates and bugfixes
Comments, suggestions, feedback welcome!
Thanks,
Ananth
