Bummer :-(  I don't think nVidia cards like DirectColor for all archs.
I'll send a patch later to revert DirectColor back to Truecolor mode.
I'm still out of town, but I should be back in several hours.  I'll also
incorporate the patches you submitted.  If this partial reversion still
doesn't work, I'll revert everything back to a known working state.
Thanks for the help.
