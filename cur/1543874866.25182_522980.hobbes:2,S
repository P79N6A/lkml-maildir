I use 2.6.20.2 kernel with ext3 rootfs on 4Gb SD on sharp zaurus sl-750 (PXA255).
After suspend/resume filesystem stay clean. But some i-nodes become broken.
Some files looks like block device or pipe with strange permissions, owner etc.
I'm sure that there is no bad blocks on SD.
I'll send any additional information. Just say me what you need to help me.
I had i lot of tries. Apply patches, remove its, change fstype etc.
