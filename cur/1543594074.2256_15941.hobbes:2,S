Modern LinuxThreads (glibc 2.2) also uses modify_ldt for thread local data
(much to the pain of the IA64 and x86-64 ports who have to emulate it..)

modify_ldt() works like a memcpy to/from the ldt. See the man page. On the
layout of the LDT see the intel IA32 architecture manual from 
http://developer.intel.com

I can imagine, but it'll cost you. Most modern CPUs have heavy penalties for
non-zero-based or limited segments (a few cycles for every memory access) and LDT
switching also makes the context switch slower.
An portable alternative is to use multiple processes with a shared memory area.
