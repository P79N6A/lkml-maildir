Hi.
How repeatable are the numbers normally? Some idea of what it is you're
benchmarking may also help in understanding the problem; locking may be an
issue with what you're benchmarking and out-of-order scheduling is not as
forgiving of poor locking. Extending the RR_INTERVAL and turning off
interactivity makes it more in-order and more forgiving of poor locking or
yield().
Compute==1 setting inactivates interactivity anyway, but that's not really
relevant to your figures since you had set interactive 0 when you set compute
1.
