Yeah, that would work but why do we want to mount all devices under
the same mount point? If you move device discovery to ->probe() it's
simple to have per-device mount points by overriding ->get_sb() to
check for USB_DEVICE_MAJOR and look up the actual device, no?
Otherwise you have to deal with device plug/unplug at filesystem
level...
