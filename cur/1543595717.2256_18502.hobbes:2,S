True, but the line is a cut and paste from higher up in
drivers/net/Config.in.  Even though it is redundant, it is consistent
with the rest of the file.
drivers/net/Config.in needs a major cleanup, lots of the if statements
can go and be replaced by dep_xxx statements, CONFIG_ETHERTAP is marked
obsolete but is tested against experimental, CONFIG_ZNET is marked
experimental but is tested against obsolete, etc.  I started to clean
up the file then decided to leave it, the entire thing is being
replaced in 2.5 anyway.
