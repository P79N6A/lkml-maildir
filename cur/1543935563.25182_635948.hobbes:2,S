Hi Ingo,
after you asked me to work against x86.git[1] I noticed
that 4 out of 5 of my previous patches didn't make sense any longer.
While I was compiling the kernel, and hopefully starting doing something
more useful (Sam, again thank you for the hints), 
I create these 4 very simple patches fixing some coding style issue.
[PATCH 1/4] x86: coding style fixes in /arch/x86/pci/common.c
[PATCH 2/4] x86: coding style fixes in arch/x86/pci/acpi.c
[PATCH 3/4] x86: coding style fixes in arch/x86/pci/direct.c
[PATCH 4/4] x86: coding style fixes in arch/x86/pci/fixup.c
And here is the diffstat:
 arch/x86/pci/acpi.c   |    4 ++--
 arch/x86/pci/common.c |   12 +++++-------
 arch/x86/pci/direct.c |   10 +++++-----
 arch/x86/pci/fixup.c  |   30 +++++++++++++++---------------
