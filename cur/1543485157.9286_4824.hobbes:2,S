  I just added some new drives to my system.  I now have 8 drives a zip
and a jaz.  The zip and jaz are on a separate controller so cable length
shouldn't be an issue.  e-h are in a case together.  I can fdisk a-g, but
h-j can't be opened.  Originally there was no sdh* sdi* or sdj*.  I created
them, couldn't access them, rebooted and still couldn't access them.
Here's sdg and sdh: (g works, h doesn't)
