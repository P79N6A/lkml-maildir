PAGE_OFFSET is not the difference between the physical address and the
virtual address; it is defined as the start address of the direct mapped
memory region where the kernel resides.  ie, it is an absolute virtual
address.  (See previous discussions on this mailing list).
It should probably be renamed in v2.5 so that it no longer implies that
it is an "_OFFSET" of anything.
