Initial availability of User-Space System Device Enumeration (uSDE) 
package, version 0.74, can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/usde
The uSDE provides an open framework for the enumeration (specification) 
of system devices in a dynamic environment. Device handling is 
implemented via plug-in programs known as policy methods. Policy methods 
are free to handle their devices in any way, from trivial to complex - 
anything from providing LSB device nodes to persistent device name 
handling with
replacement and relocation strategies.
The uSDE depends on /sbin/hotplug (for dynamic insertions and removals), 
sysfs (for device information) and /proc (various pieces of 
information). It is not dependent on initrd - it explicitly scans sysfs 
upon system startup to determine the initial device ensemble.
Part of the uSDE release is a collection of sample polices:
disk-ide-policy - handles IDE, EIDE, SATA and USB-EIDE disks. Implements 
persistent device naming, automatic device replacement and automatic 
device relocation features.
disk-scsi-policy - handles SCSI, IEEE-1394, FibreChannel and USB-SCSI 
disks including multiported devices. Iplements persistent device naming, 
automatic device replacement and automatic device relocation features.
multipath-policy - handles the automatic provisioning of multipathing 
for multiported storage devices.
ethernet-policy - handles ethernet interefaces. Implements persistent 
interface naming, interface anchoring, automatic device replacement and 
automatic device relocation features.
floppy-policy - handles internal floppy disks.
simple-device-policy - a "catch all" policy for block and character devices.
devfs-policy - provides devfs device names.
lsb-policy - provides LSB device names.
