Subject: [PATCH] tgafb: Fix an out-of-range shift in mono imageblit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/15/250

 The pixel mask calculation in tgafb_mono_imageblit() uses a variable 
left-shift on a 32-bit data type by up to 32.  Shifting by the width of a 
data type or more produces an unpredictable result according to the C 
standard.
 Rather than widening the data type this fix makes sure the count is 
between 0 and 31.  The reason is not to penalise 32-bit platforms with 
operation on a "long long" type for a marginal case that is meant not to 
happen (blitting an image of a zero width).
 The reason it has escaped for so long is the Alpha, being purely 64-bit, 
:-) does not mask the shift out to 32 bits.  This is a valid 
implementation -- producing the correct result certainly falls within 
"unpredictable behaviour".  It does trigger on MIPS though and it is the 
recent merge of the TC support which only enabled the driver for use on 
anything other than the Alpha.  For MIPS when the width is 32 the mask 
ends up being 0 rather than 0xffffffff as it should be and the frame 
buffer is not updated.

 Checked with checkpatch.pl and at the run time with an 8-bit TC frame 
buffer on a MIPS host.  It fixes scrolling corruption.
 Please apply.
