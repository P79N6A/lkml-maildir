That's the theory now for some time, has never worked.  Even hacking
the SCSI driver, any attempted IRQ sharing kills my systems.  Even my
quad ethernet is not successful at sharing IRQs with itself, in 2+ very
different motherboards.

Hehe.  The only reason you got a reply from me was that I run
video4linux with 2.4 kernels without a problem (or at least I think I
do, there are some problems but never when using xawtv).
Additionally, I've run the new RAID since the initrd period and
mingo's patches have never failed.  Any problems with RAID mentioned
on the mailing list were always traced to user error.  In short, what
you were trying to run worked fine here.
Replies afterwards were merely some guesses based on the
information you supplied.  Such as: try pulling out some hardware and
seeing if that helps.  You need to troubleshoot down to something
repeatable in order to get additional help.
