Subject: 2.6.0-test3: setuid32(8) returns EAGAIN (WTF?!)

I just changed from 2.5.75 to 2.6.0-test3 and suddenly my imap server
fails to start (it's dovecot).  It wrote to syslog:
Aug 17 02:58:02 hellhound dovecot: Dovecot starting up
Aug 17 02:58:03 hellhound imap-login: setuid(8) failed: Resource temporarily unavailable
Aug 17 02:58:03 hellhound dovecot: Login process died too early - shutting down
So I strace -f it, and sure enough, here is what happens:
[init, fork, tzfile...]
8094  chroot("/var/run/dovecot//login") = 0
8094  chdir("/")                        = 0
8094  setuid32(0x8)                     = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
Now this does not appear to be a valid return value for setuid32, and
my understanding of POSIX and Susv3 is that dovecot is absolutely right
in barfing at this.
Why is this happening?  Please fix!
Felix
PS: Time for a brown paper bag bug-fix release, if you ask me.
