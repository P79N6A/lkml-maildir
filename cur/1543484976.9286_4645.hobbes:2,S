Hey,
    I have been contemplating making a custom linux install of my
machine for  a long time. I find that all linux distrobutions come with
too much crap that waste hd space, and I like to know exactly what is on
my machine. So may question is What does the Linux kernel require to
boot? Are does a very basic base distrobution need? What should I
include to start with? I figure I will look at some of the floppy linux
distros and see what they use for a start. Any help would be
appreciated, thanks.
