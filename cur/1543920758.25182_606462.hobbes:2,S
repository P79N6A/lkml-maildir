I assume that in order to do things "right", all possible addresses should be 
probed (for this part, that is 0x2C, 0x2D, 0x2E, 0x2F)?
And it should read a device ID (register 0x17 == 0xE62n (where n==rev number))
How many values/registers do you need to read before you say "this is the 
one"? rather than a temp sensor with a similar value somewhere. Is there a 
table anywhere that maps this out?
It is pretty difficult just to probe on reset values, since that disallows 
warm resets. This part - like most other I2C parts, has no external reset, 
only software reset.

The hope is that others can use it - it shouldn't be specific to Blackfin.
