That's sort of how that original "coldplug" script worked, but it didn't
work except in some trivial cases.  For example, it fails in a common case
when platform_device.id != -1; and for platform devices that are children
of other devices.  And of course there's the syntax issue ... only one
module name at a time (so modprobe in a loop).
The MODULE_ALIAS() stuff only kicks in when the driver name isn't the
same as its module name.  Normally, developers just stick to one name.

To repeat, I am _not_ the one who has made that proposal.  I'm the one
pointing out that all names for a module (aliases vs. what "ls" shows)
should be treated the same ... introducing a new rule about how hotplug
(or coldplug) must only refer to aliases promotes fragility.

Marco was overlooking it.
I thought about moving that bit elsewhere, but three things came to mind:
 * Space-wise, there are already unused bits there, so this is free;
   but there are no such bits in platform_device.
 * Given that this is a "legacy style" issue, not all such driver
   code is (or will be) on the platform bus.
 * Hey, not all devices and busses support hotplugging, and it'd be
   worth having discussion on that.  The flag is explicitly about
   the _driver_ not supporting hotplug ... a device node creation
   problem.  When the _device_ is physically not hotpluggable, a
   different approach might help rid the kernel of probe()/remove()
   infrastructure.
Given those points, I thought this was probably the best place to
put it; at least as an initial proposal.
Another proposal, which I dislike, is just not to have platform_bus
do hotplug (via $MODALIAS).  That'd be OK for some current embedded
systems, since the devices get created during board startup and are
not added/removed later, but that's exactly the sort of idiosyncratic
restriction I've observed will invariably cause pain later on.  It's
too easy to think of counterexamples, like devices appearing when a
board gets powered up.
