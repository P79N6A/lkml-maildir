Yes, I saw a combination of the "can't fill rx buffer" messages and
"card reports no resources" messages, and after a while it went to
just a whole bunch (few hundred) of the "card reports no resources"
messages, which continued to scroll across the console at the rate of
one every second or so until I took down networking and removed the
eepro100 module.

After I removed the load, I gave it about 10 minutes or so to see if
it would pick back up, but it didn't.
