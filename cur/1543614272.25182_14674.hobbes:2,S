I'm in the same boat with my Maxtor 54098U8.  It has been getting
progressively slower.  Two weeks ago I was getting a whopping 3MB/s,
now I get:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 115.29 seconds =568.44 kB/sec
My CDROM (ide-scsi) is faster than this!
# time dd if=/dev/scd0 of=/dev/null count=32k bs=512
real    0m8.443s
  = 1.8MB/sec
The wierd thing is that I don't get any errors, but I have just
switched from emacs to vi. :-) I ran Maxtor's powermax.exe and their
90sec test hadn't finished after 20 minutes so I rebooted. :-(
Same results with 2.4.9 - 2.4.17.
