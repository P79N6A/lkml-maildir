OK here's the problem! The code is (effectively) setting:
	int sockbuflen = 0;
	setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF,
                  (char *)&sockbuflen, sizeof sockbuflen);
This is kind of a user level bug, to set the socket buffer size to
zero.  However, the man page for setsockopt says,
       "SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF are options  to  adjust  the
       normal   buffer  sizes  allocated  for  output  and  input
       buffers, respectively.  The buffer size may  be  increased
       for  high-volume connections, or may be decreased to limit
       the possible backlog of incoming data.  The system  places
       an absolute limit on these values."
By doing a getsockopt() I can see this lower limit is currently set to
256.  However, for some reason this is too low!  For some reason what
ever I set with setsockopt() is multiplied by 2. (another bug?) I did
trial and error and found for:
setsockopt    getsockopt    select() works?
--------------------------------------------
 1008          2016         No
 1009          2018         Yes
It other words if I try to set the recieve buffer to 1008 (or less)
with setsockopt() the select() doesn't work, but it does with 1009 (or
above).
I'm running glibc-2.0.7 (rev.29, from redhat-5.2).
Once I set sockbuflen above to a value greater than 1009 everything
started working...
	Thanks,
