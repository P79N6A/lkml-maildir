I encourage you to do this one, it really affects performance significantly for
squid.  Reiserfs would put everything in one directory for squid and gain 10-24%
if not for this lock.  Whether it should be done pre or post 2.4 I leave to
others.....  except to say that we will be happy to scramble a bit to adapt to
your fix of this.
