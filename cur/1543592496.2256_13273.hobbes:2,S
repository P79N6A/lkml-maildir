yes , this is what i am looking for :)
Can we use "HP Jornada 600 series" inspite of "WindowsCE machine" ?
BTW, in Jornada 600 series only Keyboard and LCD is working and some CPU
related stuff  which we can found in Hitachi Manuals , thats it .
But linux-arm is supporting full iPAQ hardware .
Thank you,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
