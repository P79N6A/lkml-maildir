Hi -
Thanks for your time-
Greg
[1.] glibc remove("foo/.") removes foo with 2.2.2, not with 2.0.36
[2.] Full description:
I ran into this problem on a Debian 2.1 system that had been
upgraded to the 2.2.2 kernel.  I was able to "fix" the problem
by going back to the 2.0.36 kernel.  I saw some related threads
(adding special cases for "." and ".." in rmdir) but nothing
exactly like what I'm seeing.
From the man page for remove(3), directories should remain intact.
This simple C program proves otherwise with the 2.2.2 kernel.
#include <stdio.h>
void main (void) { remove("foo/."); }
At first I suspected glibc but traced the remove function there 
back to an rmdir system call.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
filesystem, rmdir
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.2 (root@igloo) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #2 Wed Feb 24 10:28:26 EST 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
N/A.
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
     mkdir foo
     rmdir foo/.
     Or the C program above.
