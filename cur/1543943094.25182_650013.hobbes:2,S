Agreed.

Even without the hardware acceleration, a user write to set_brightness
leaves any active trigger active and isn't really intuitive or right
either.

I'll accept a patch for that :).

Ouch, I'm looking into this. I wish I'd known about it earlier. I agree
function is more important but didn't want to break the existing
convention. I guess this limitation comes from the kobjects involved...
