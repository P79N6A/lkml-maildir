I'm porting rmap to 2.5 now, doing just this.
One thing I noticed was that the space usage of all the
bk trees I'm using in order to keep the different changes
individually pullable is about 1.5 GB now.
Not too big an issue for me, but it might be an issue if
every bkbits.net user starts doing this ... ;)
cheers,
Rik
