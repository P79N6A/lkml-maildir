It's not "mixed up" at all: the permissions checking has to be done by
the server, period.
All the file security information (the mode bits, owner uid, group gid,
ACLs etc) that determine whether or not the open() should succeed are
defined on the *server* not on the client. If the former is doing some
form of mapping of those values (in particular if it is doing some form
of root/uid/gid squashing) then the only way for the client to get it
right is to make an ACCESS call.
The fact that the subsequent writes go to a device on the client is
entirely irrelevant.
Cheers,
