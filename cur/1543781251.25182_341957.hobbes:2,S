We certainly could interpret 0x51, 0x04 specifically. Its not an "error"
in the usual spew at the user case generally speaking but a "do this"
"no" sequence. Its useful to log because sending unknown commands to an
IDE device is something we want to catch (some drives hang if you do it,
others do really *crazy* things).
Would
hdc: command not supported by drive
ide: failed opcode was: 0xec
have been more helpful
