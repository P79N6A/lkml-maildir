   Oh. Sorry. Probably I need to work on my English bit more.

   Absolutely.
   High-end toys, after all, optimized to handle this.
   IMHO this should be settled on per-target basis: embedded system - 
-Os; servers - -O2; desktops - -O3 ;) So instead of CONFIG_EMBEDDED 
better to have CONFIG_TARGET=[desktop|server|embedded].
   Inroducing one more variable into builds - is really painful. I was 
hit by gcc miscompiles and internal errors not once (especially with 
-O[23]). Tracking down this kind of issues would be made more problematic.
P.S. I'm really sorry for my rude response.
