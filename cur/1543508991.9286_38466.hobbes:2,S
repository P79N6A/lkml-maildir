The Oops you seen is forced by the IKD debugging code and it's not a bug
(it's just to get a stack trace). But you must have also one other line
before the Oops to tell us the reason of the Oops. You didn't quoted it.
Also probably you want to disable everything in the IKD patch except the
NMI watchdog, if the NMI won't be helpful then you can use other things in
the IKD patch. Actually I am not 100% sure if the other debugging code is
completly reliable, as I don't use it since some time ago. I'll have a
look...
