Why a config option?  Why not a module parameter, settable at module load time?
static int enable_preempter;
...
module_param(enable_preempter, bool, 0);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(enable_preempter, "Enable preempting thread, to test RCU priority boosting");
...
rcu_torture_cleanup(void)
{
...
	if (enable_preempter && cur_ops->preemptend)
		cur_ops->preemptend();
...
	if (enable_preempter && cur_ops->preemptstart)
		cur_ops->preemptstart();
Then just remove the #ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST from rcutorture entirely,
and always supply the preempter functions.  rcutorture then doesn't depend on
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST at all, and the module parameter determines whether
to run the preempter thread.

Ah, that makes much more sense; thanks.
