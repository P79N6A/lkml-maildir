Subject: Question about memcpy_fromio prototype

Hi Linus.  On x86 and ia64, memcpy_fromio is protoyped as:
static inline void memcpy_fromio(void *dst, volatile void __iomem *src, int count)
ALSA does this (except on x86 and sparc32, so you don't see it):
int copy_to_user_fromio(void __user *dst, const void __iomem *src, size_t count)
[...]
                memcpy_fromio(buf, src, c);
which provokes a warning from gcc that we're discarding a qualifier (the
'const') from src.  Is ALSA just wrong?  Or is the 'volatile' wrong?

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
