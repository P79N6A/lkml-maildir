For example: DFORTIFY_SOURCE=2 or ftree-ch, because it's not enabled
by Os, but does indeed help often, especially in the case of various
kernel codepaths.
As to CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE, I realize.  "-Os" is just easier to
type and I assume that a kernel dev list would map the correct config
option.  ;)

My point exactly.  Enabling experimental or broken options is already
ignored pretty well, so how hard is it to just create such a policy
and go about shooting down people who've messed up?  In all fairness,
most people on the mailing list are terse and, shall we say,
aggressive.  I don't really see there being much of a problem with a
few extra faulty bug reports.  I feel that the good done would
outweigh the slight overhead of a few idiots.

Erm... what are you responding to?  I don't know what that "wrong"
refers to.  Especially considering that the paragraph you're
referencing is an opinion and personal thought.
