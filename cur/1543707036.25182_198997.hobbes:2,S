Hello,
~    I'm posting to the list blindly this following report:
LIST_DELETE: net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c:295
&ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY] (c40bf384) not in &ip_conntrack_hash[hr]
I believe the memory addresses are not as pertinent as the message
itself, but the screen filled up with 4-5 of these lines before finally
biting the dust.
Can someone shoot me an e-mail in reply to let me know if this is a bug
in netfilter code or if I'm just somehow confusing the heck out of the
nat filter?  I've got a set of nat forwarding rules that forwards an ip
address onto the internal lan, and then from there I'm only allowing
certain packets to go through -- that seems to have exacerbated the
problem..
Thanks in advance!
Pete
