There are strange things happening in here.

One would expect the inode validity test to be
	(ino >= EXT3_FIRST_INO(sb)) && (ino < ...->s_inodes_count))
but even this assumes that s_inodes_count is misnamed and really should be
called s_last_inode_plus_one.  If it is not misnamed then the validity test
should be
	(ino >= EXT3_FIRST_INO(sb)) &&
		(ino < EXT3_FIRST_INO(sb) + ...->s_inodes_count))
Look through the filesystem for other uses of EXT3_FIRST_INO().  It's all
rather fishily inconsistent.
Ted, Andreas: do you think we could come up with statements describing
exactly what the values in EXT3_FIRST_INO() and in ->s_inodes_count
represent?  Thanks.
Also Neil, I wonder whether this patch of yours still permits NFS clients
to access the journal and resize inodes in undesirable ways?
