wow, it's really amazing how reiser4 can still inspire flamewars so

yeah, i sure wish Grev was still around running the benchmarks and
regression testing, cause I thought she came up with a good, QA
oriented mix of real benchmarks.  aside from a number of streaming
video benchmarks i did, those were the only results i actually trusted
to compare reiser4 with other systems.  I know Ted doesn't like the
Mongo suite, cause it focuses on small files and shows the common
weakness of block-aligned storage ... personally i thought it was
great for its primary purpose, making sure reiser4 was optimized for
its target workload.  i also recall that the distribution of small
files to large ones in mongo was pulled from some paper out of CMU,
but i can't find the reference to that study right now.

well, it turns out that reiser4 does things a little differently,
since tail packing has bad performance effects (i always turn it off
on my reiserfs partitions).  Reiser4 guarantees a file will be stored
contiguously if it is below a certain size (20K?), and instead stores
the whole file unaligned, so that many files can be packed together
without slack space.  this gives the best of both worlds
performance-wise, at the expense of some complicated flush code to
pack everything together in the tree before it gets written.  that
combined with the fine-grained locking scheme (per-node -- reiserfs
just has a global lock) is the primary reason the code is so
convoluted ... not poor coding.

my understanding of the code is that it uses a heuristic to decide if
a file is already compressed, so that the system doesn't waste time on
them and simply writes them out directly.  there may also be a way to
turn it off for certain classes of files, this would be most useful
for executables and the like that are frequently mmap()ed and we care
more about page-alignment than read bandwidth or data density.

i guess the idea with reiser4's compression (encryption and
compression, actually) is that you can get the feature for files you
care about without having to use *extra* CPU time, it only does the
work at flush time so that you can take advantage of cache effects for
files that see lots of modifications.  ATM i doubt this works well
though, cause you'd have to manually increase dirty_background_ratio
to keep things from continually flushing and using background CPU
