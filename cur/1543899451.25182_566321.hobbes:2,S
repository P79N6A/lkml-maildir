Exactly.
And if we really want to get rid of the freezer, we need to _prepare_ for
that.  At least, we need to have an idea of how we will do thing when the
freezer is not there.
For example, how will we check if the system is not in a state in which the
resume is likely to fail?
There are more questions like that, IMO, and we should at least have a list
of them _before_ we remove the freezer.

Rafael
