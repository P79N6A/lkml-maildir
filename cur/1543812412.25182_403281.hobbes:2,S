It was Nick's commit 8426e1f6af0fd7f44d040af7263750c5a52f3cc3 that added 
atomic_inc_not_zero(), and Nick's patch that changed fs/file_table.c 
from rcuref_dec_and_test() to atomic_dec_and_test() exposed this 
problem.

Exactly, that's what I wanted to say in my report.

It seems this is the case.
And as far as I can see, m68k is the only architecture where cmpxchg 
isn't always available.
