Yes, that would be what it is, and why.
I would vote that the sd stop-on-shutdown patch should go in, and 
possibly with the new behavior enabled by default. Surely the number of 
people running Linux on a laptop (or any other system with load/unload 
head technology drives) is much greater than the number of people 
running a SAN, multi-initiator, etc. environment where you might not 
want this..
