huh?  Where Kame suggested is just a couple lines of code and one test
below where I suggested.  How is this farther from memory hotplug, as
it still seems to be in one of the main memory hotplug routines -
add_memory()?
And why would I want to place a hook that tracks hotplug added memory
nodes 'farther from memory hotplug'?
