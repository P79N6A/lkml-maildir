Glad to see this!  Is this for AT91sam9261-EK board support, maybe?

Hmm, unfortunately there are a lot of updates to this driver sitting in
the linux-omap tree ... the N770 guys really put a lot of solid work into
it (ISTR seeing a statistical plot showing how touchscreen debounce helps
get stable readings!), but those patches didn't get upstream yet.
One of the more critical of those patches addressed much the same pendown
state issue; it turns out that measuring pressure (after the pendown irq)
isn't the best way to notice when pen status becomes "up".
Let me try to sort out the mess with those updates, and ask you to refresh
this ads7843 support against that more-current ads7846 code.  (Or if you
want a preview, have a look at the linux-omap tree.  There's a clone of
that in the GIT area on kernel.org if you want.)

You must be working with a buggy controller driver then.  That part of
this patch should never be needed.  It's expected that rx-only transfers
will omit a tx buf; all controller drivers must handle that case.
