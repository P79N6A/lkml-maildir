Hi Alan,
Thanks for the clarifications. Just one more set of clarifications:
>It doesn't prevent such use but it makes the default behaviour
>for a driver correct so makes it easier to write drivers correctly
1. Is the performance penalty we pay for every read and write worth
this? I assume it does.
2. Would it provide better enforcement if the file structure is also a
copied when passed to drivers? A kind of encapsulation...
Regards,
Manjunath
