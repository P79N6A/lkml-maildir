What architecture?   x86?
If so then bear in mind that your memory is split into 500MB highmem and
800MB lowmem.  The kernel might be starting I/O due to the highmem zone
being full of dirty pages.  That'd be wrong of it if so - it's supposed to
just fall back to lowmem for the page allocations, but that code has
changed quite a bit in the two years since I got all that working...
You need to run `watch -n1 cat /proc/meminfo' while doing these tests...
