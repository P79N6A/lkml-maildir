If any user can do that, then Linux is borken solid.
Just out of curiosity, what is wrong with the idea of having the kernel
at iopl(0), any kernel modules at either iopl(1) or iopl(2) and apps at
iopl(3) ??? There is obviously something, but I've no idea what.

I've no problem with that at all, but the bulk of the comments I've seen
in this thread have been very clear about taking /dev/rtc out of the
kernel and into a userspace daemon, with the kernel just providing
access to the relevant ports to the first app to claim them.
Best wishes from Riley.
