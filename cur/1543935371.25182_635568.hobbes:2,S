Hi Sam,
After disabling the headers_check, the build failure is not seen,
i tried compiling 2.6.24-rc{2,3,4,5,6,7} all of these have this failure.
And when i tried compiling 2.6.23 with allyesconfig i got the following
error
  SYSCALL arch/x86_64/vdso/vdso.so
/usr/bin/ld: section .data [ffffffffff700900 -> ffffffffff700917] overlaps section .plt [ffffffffff7008e4 -> ffffffffff700903]
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/vdso/vdso.so] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86_64/vdso] Error 2

# gcc --version
