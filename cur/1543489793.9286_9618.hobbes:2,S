I think this is something has to be done in the patch-ikd-arca and not in
the mainstream kernel. patch-ikd-arca has just many neat features very
very useful for both profiling and debugging the kernel. But since it's
only something that only hackers will care about it's here instead of in
the kernel ;)

I forget to do a 2.2.3 release, hopefully the 2.2.2 will works fine in
2.2.3...
