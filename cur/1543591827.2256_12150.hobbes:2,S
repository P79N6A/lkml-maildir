This isnt a CML2 related problem. 
Problem 1: 
	People who don't like the CML2 description
Problem 2:
	People who don't like python
Problem 3:
	People who don't like the tool design
Problem 4:
	People who don't have python2 
#1 is the important item
#2 is fixed by rewriting tools in C
#3 is fixed by writing alternative tools using CML2 - and if you cant its a bug
   in the CML2 language
#4 is probably one for the LDPS/LSB and vendor people to discuss so we have an
official path for python2
