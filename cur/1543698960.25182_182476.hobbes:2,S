The difference is that GPM (I assume you are using it to get Synaptics
support) only logs "protocol violations" when in debug mode, and then it
only checks 2 first bytes. The XFree driver does check the protocol but
its messages usually don't show up in the syslog. In other words in-kernel
Synaptics driver just makes the problem apparent it seems.
From what I saw in one case where Synaptics was loosing sync it looked
like 2 first bytes of the 6 byte packet were lost (psmouse never got them).
Would be interesting to compile i8042.c with debug and see the full flow 
of a problem system...
