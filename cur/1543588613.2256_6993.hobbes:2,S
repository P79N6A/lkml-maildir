	Previous variant left junk in ->d_type of directory entries
on "old" filesystems (i.e. ones where it should be zeroed). Harmless
(on these filesystems readdir() returned DT_UNKNOWN anyway), but
it PO'd fsck and was the wrong thing anyway.
	Fixed and rediffed against current tree (2.4.4-pre6). Folks,
please help with testing.
 	Patch is on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-dir-patch-S4-pre6.gz
