Tried again - these were done as part of a full contest run, not just mem_load 
by itself, but these were the mem_load results:
98
128
135
then it oopsed (the one I posted earlier) and wasn't really usable after that 
point. Perhaps they're related. The mystery remains. I'll see what happens 
next mm release.
