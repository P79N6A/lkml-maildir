The core problem is not when there is a single user.  The problem is
that no matter how large the system gets we have a single lock.  So it
gets increasingly contended.
I almost removed the tasklist_lock from all read paths.  But as it
happens sending a signal to a process group is an atomic operation
with respect to fork so that path has to take the lock, or else
we get places where "kill -9 -pgrp" fails to kill every process in
the process group.  Which is even worse.

Hmm.  Possibly.  Mostly what I was thinking is that a token in the
list simply cannot solve the problem of a guaranteeing lseek to a
previous position works.  I really haven't looked closely on
how you handle that case.

One of the reasons I have an issue with it, is that with the
impending introduction of multiple pid spaces is that the task list
really isn't what we want to traverse.

I intend to, I'm unfortunately busy in another direction at the
moment.
