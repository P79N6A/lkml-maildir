Everywhere I read on this list, people seem to have beefs
with the current stock 2.2.x knfsd implementation.  Are
there any webpages outlining what shortcomings it currently
has?  I currently have no problems (that I know of) with
the setup I have running, but also recognize I am only
using Linux in my setup(both as the knfsd server and the
knfs clients).
I keep seeing references to a better knfs implementation with
a set of newer patches/tools, but don't understand what the
benefits/disadvantages are.  I'm not looking for a handout,
I'll of course RTFM, but I don't know where to go.
Any advice will be well-taken.  Thanks.
