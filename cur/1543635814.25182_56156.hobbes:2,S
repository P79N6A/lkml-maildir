Normally MAP_NORESERVE has no effect when MAP_SHARED is specfied,
since mods will be written out to file, so don't need memory+swap.
You're looking at the special case of a tmpfs file (actually,
the even more special case of an internally created tmpfs file),
which of course needs memory+swap, since it has no disk backing.
But (for whatever this jesuitical argument is worth: probably not
much) it's the object which needs that memory+swap, not the shared
mapping of that object.  Should MAP_NORESERVE apply to the object
in this case?  At this moment, I'm uncertain (but since the object
has been created internally purely to provide that mapping, it may
be unhelpful to deny it).
You were writing of mainline 2.4 or 2.5, where reservation isn't
taken seriously anyway.  It becomes more serious in the -ac tree,
or with rml's patch, where it's more than a question of MAP_NORESERVE.
Check /proc/meminfo Committed_AS and you'll find we reserve twice the
size of a shared anonymous mapping (in this tree, do_mmap_pgoff
is calling vm_enough_memory even when MAP_SHARED but file NULL,
then it's called again as you found in shmem_file_setup).
But at least the numbers do balance out when unmapping.
I'll take another look at this in a few days, right now I'm a
little confused by it.  Just dropping check from shmem_file_setup
won't be the answer, I believe SysV IPC SHM needs it, and in
ac/rml it's needed to balance removal of the object.
Thanks for raising the issue.
Hugh
