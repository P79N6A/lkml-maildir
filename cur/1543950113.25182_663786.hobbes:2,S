OK. Hmm, I've not really thought about it. At first thought, it should
not be very difficult. Only thing I am not sure is the arbitrary
grouping of the groups (ok, a bit confusing). If that information is
maintained somewhere, it should be pretty straightforward. (Only thing
is that I am not sure how it will be done, and where the grouping
information should be stored. configuration looks like the logical
place, but I am not sure)
