If futexes are limited by user limits, that's going to mean some
threading program gets a surprise when too many threads decide to
block on a resource.  That's really nasty.  (Of course, a program can
get a surprise due to just running out of memory in sys_futex() too,
but that's much rarer).
It would be nice if the futex waitqueues could be re-hashed against
swap entries when pages are swapped out, somehow, but this sounds hard.
