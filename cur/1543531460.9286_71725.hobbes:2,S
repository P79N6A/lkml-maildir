Subject: [2.3.99-pre3-[67]] error copying to nfs mounted raid0 filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

When I try to copy a file to an nfs mounted raid0 filesystem I get this
error from cp
cp: ./junk: Input/output error
cp: ./junk: Input/output error
and only 200704 bytes are copied.
These errors appear in the logs on the nfs client side

The nfs server is an 200MMX x86 machine running kernel 2.2.15pre10 + 0.9
raid + pppox patches and has been up for ~26 days. It has
nfs-server-clients-2.2beta37-1 and nfs-server-2.2beta37-1 rpm packages
installed.
The nfs client machine is x86 with LVM enabled ( and appropriate LVM patch
from linux.msede.com applied), but no LVM volumes were involved in my
tests. It has knfsd-clients-1.4.7-7 knfsd-1.4.7-7 packges installed. I
have seen this with kernels 2.3.99pre3-6 and 7, the 2.3.~52 and
previous kernels seemed to be ok.
Reading/writing to non-raid nfs filesystems seems to be fine, reading from
the nfs raid0 is also ok. I tried this patch from Trond/Linus that I found
on LKML

It didn't help.
