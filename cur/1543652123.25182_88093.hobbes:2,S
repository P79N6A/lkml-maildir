The reason I maintain vmstat2 (NOT based on any of your code AFAIK) is
that I want to see data rates on the non-loopback NICs. I also have a
timestamp every line option and after 2.5 settles a bit and I get the time
to find where things are I want optional stats by individual NIC, and
individual drive and partition if I can find it. It isn't in partitions
any more, and the file I was told to use doesn't exist. Maybe in devicefs?
Oh, and -M starts the output with memory sizes, for a package to generate
usage graphs with a line at physical memory size.
An option to flush the buffers after each line even when writing to a
pipe.
Line length: the w option in ps doesn't worry about it, why should vmstat?
If the user tells you to show more, do it.
vmstat2 output attached (it's wide).
