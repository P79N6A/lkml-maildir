hi
I am looking for the result of the function  move_task in
kernel/sched.c , I have observed that it returns an int value and as I
print it with printk.
I have created a int variable 'results_move_task' which capture the result of
move_task and I print it with printk("%d",results_move_task); I
observed that it often returns the value '1' and sometimes it returns
'2' or more. Is it really correct?

PS:Sorry about my english.
