	I thought you wanted improved latency. Surely having to find a page for you
when your stack grows will add unpredictable latency. So, no, the thread
library should reserve the stack when 'mlockall(MCL_FUTURE)' is specified.
	I do agree that having an 'initial stack size' in additional to a 'maximum
stack size' would be a good idea. The former good for application that are
concerned about physical memory usage and the latter for applications
concerned about virtual memory usage.
