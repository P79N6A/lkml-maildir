Hi,
We are facing a problem regarding the network communication.
System: Linux Kernel 2.4.7 with rmk2 and np1 patch on Assabet board.
Problem: After setting all the required and necessary network parameters and
running the utlility ifconfig we get the following error message
SIOCSIFHWADDR: Device or resource busy
But the IP Address, Netmask and Broadcast addressess are properly set.
After this if we run ftp we get the following error message
ftp: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0 timeout
We tried increasing the timeout period but in vain.
Pls Suggest
Regards
Chandrasekhar
