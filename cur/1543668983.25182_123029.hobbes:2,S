Oh, the timer changes made caused sshd to hang It appears.
When it next does this I will sysctl+T and report the output.
It's still hard to track this problem, but at least its not causing the box
to hang anymore, so part of the problem is solved :-)

What is "it"?
I receive rather a lot of email and am dependent on people helping me
out a bit with context.  I have lost the plot on this one.
