I found it with git-bisect. The Fedora kernel has been broken on this
particular 512MiB Mac Mini for a while, and now I've reverted the patch
it seems to be fine again. So I'm fairly sure. I'll be surer in a few
minutes once the full RPM build has finished with the patch reverted.
Of course, it could easily be an entirely separate bug which by some
bizarre coincidence is just triggered by this.
