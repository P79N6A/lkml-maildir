Well, one can certainly do this.  The "make install" dream is just that,
a dream.  You can set a standard saying the kernel belongs in /boot, but
that doesn't mean everyone will put it there.
In my opinion, the process of installing a kernel should require a certain
IQ from the installer.  That means no button for a trained monkey to push.
(You would be amazed the mount of shit I've had to clean up following the
 pushing of that button by a "trained" (huge assumtion) monkey.)
