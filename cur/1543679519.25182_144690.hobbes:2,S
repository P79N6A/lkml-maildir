If I do that, then on the eventX device I will see both 'real'
relative events and 'synthesised' (from absoule) relative events and I
won't be able to tell the difference.

A device should present raw events.  Whatever the user says to the
device should come out eventX uninterpreted.
mousedev should interpret what it can and present this out
/dev/psaux.  As it can do limited interpretation of ABS events, it
should.
This seems different to your perspective, but seeing there is not
standard or other document that we can make reference too, it is not
clear that anyone can decide who is *right*.....
