Andrea, 
I've just read a bit of your new VM code and I have a few comments.
You completly removed the "inactive freeable pages" logic: There is no
more distiction between "freeable inactive" and "free" pages. All VM work
is based on "freepages.high" watermark. I don't like that: it seems to
make page freeing more aggressive over time.
Also, if we have several try_to_free_pages() callers, for different
classzones, I'm right saying that a caller with a "smaller" classzone can
"hide" pages in its "active_local_lru" and/or "inactive_local_lru" (during
shrink_cache) from other processes trying to free pages from those higher
zones ?
