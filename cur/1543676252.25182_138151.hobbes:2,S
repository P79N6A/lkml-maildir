Ah, that's what I couldn't find in the source, thanks.
My observation is that only the first 15 bytes of mbox may be altered by
the user thus, since the issue_scb.. functions copy the mbox anyway,
there's not much point allocating the full mbox (although there's no
harm in doing so).  But rather than going back to the 16 byte
allocations and fixing the memset sizes, I think mbox_t should be split
into two pieces (and out and an in, with the issue_scb..() routines only
taking the in part) that way everything can be correctly written in
terms of sizeof.
I was also separately worried about the memcpy in the issue_scb..()
routines which looks like it will set the mbox->busy parameter
(controlled by the driver) to zero.  So I copied Atul to see if this is
a genuine problem or not.
