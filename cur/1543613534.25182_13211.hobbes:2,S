Yes, you can mount as many as you like.

Ah, right.  Set the size to the minimum of the most RAM you can spare
and the biggest size of your tmp.  You can also specify max inode
entries, but size is probably best here.  You can pass "size=32m" or
whatever as an option.
See Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt for more information.
