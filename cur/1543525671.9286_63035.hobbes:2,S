I think we're not communicating.  SCSI assumes the ability to transfer
large blocks.  What SCSI performance be like if the largest transfer
was 1500 bytes?  STP solves that problem (and the flow control problem
as well as some others).  These problems just don't exist in the SCSI
world, SCSI implicitly assumes a DMA like interface where there is no
limit on the size of the DMA (well, certainly not a 1500 byte limit,
some older systems maxed out at 32 or 64K size transfers).
Am I missing knowledge of some advance in SCSI?
