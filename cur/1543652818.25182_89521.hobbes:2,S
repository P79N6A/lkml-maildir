This could work if we find the max gid, allocate an array of 
max_gid/CHAR_BITS + 1 bytes then test_bit, but given the non-contiguity 
(is that a word) of group memberships, we'll waste a lot of space on 
holes. Now, it could be argued that 10,000 groups are PROBABLY local 
enough.  Getting the groups back out will be nasty nastiness, though.
perhaps:
if (gidsetsize < (2 * EXEC_PAGESIZE)/sizeof(gid_t)) { /* or something */
	/* use kmalloc() */
else
	/* use vmalloc() */
thoughts?
