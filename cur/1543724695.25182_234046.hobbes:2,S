KDE is a peice of shit with regards to file handling.
It seems they never learnt the lessons of writing files in Unix that
have been learnt over the last 30 years.
How the hell can you afford to hose your entire WM because KDE decides
to write some obscure file at some time when the NFS servers just
happen to be temporarily down? What ever happened to the standard
practice of write to temp file, then atomic rename? What ever happened
to making backups of critical files before overwriting them? Furrfu.
Makes me glad I use a much more sane WM, but I pity those 3 users in
the space of a few minutes who lost all of their settings.
BTW, I have submitted the occasional bug to Debian because packages
will cause dataloss to an /etc file if the disk happens to run out at
the wrong moment (quite a common occurence for me). Furrfu people -
this is so bloody simple to get right.

The prolonged application of polysyllabic vocabulary infallibly
exercises a deleterious influence on the fecundity of expression,
rendering the ultimate tendancy apocryphal.
