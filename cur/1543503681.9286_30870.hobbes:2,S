Thankfully most of these things are printk warning issues.
You should UPcast to a long in most cases, not downcast to an int.

No.  Cast to a long, and s/%d/%ld/ for that arg.  This particular case
will work but in general you definitely don't want to cast pointer
values (or the results of ptr arithmatic) to an int.

That looks ok.
I actually made these changes myself but was waiting for the filesystem
stuff to settle down before posting it.
