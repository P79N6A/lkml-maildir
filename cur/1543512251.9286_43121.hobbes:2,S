	No...  /etc/passwd maps numbers to names, the numbers are what
actually own the files.

	Again, a user-space config file for a user-space process
(login).

	This is a config file read by user-space programs which accept 
connections.
	These are all config files for userspace programs, not the
same thing as a config-file for permissions on a filesystem...
	Modifications to devfs modify kernel-space permissions, not
even file-system space permissions, although they look like filesystem
space permissions.
