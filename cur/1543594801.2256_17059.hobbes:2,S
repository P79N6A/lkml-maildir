In practice it's a BS. There is a lot of ways minor modifications of code
could add a preemption point, so if you rely on the lack of such - expect
major PITA.
Yes, in theory SMP adds some extra fun. Practically, almost every "SMP"
race found so far did not require SMP.
Clean code is trivial to make SMP-safe - critical areas that rely on
lack of preemption are couple of instructions wide and are easy to
protect. Anything trickier and I bet that you have a race on (normal)
UP kernel. Been there, found probably several hundreds of them.
