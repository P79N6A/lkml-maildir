For those of us who only develop on nfsroot-based systems, does this
step include adding userspace network interface configuration and
bootp/dhcp client functionality to kinit?  I want to assume that
"getting rid of NFSroot/bootp/dhcp" means moving that particular
functionality as part of this step.  Just wondering what the
short-term impact will be on the poor embedded guys. :)
