Ah, he sucks another person into the "module unload" discussion.  My

I agree, it's a difficult problem to solve, and something we aren't
going to do for 2.6.  That's one reason why module unload is its own
config option :)
Anyway, Rusty's proposal of "never unload, just mark not used" and then
load a new copy into memory that he did during the OLS timeframe last
year sounds like the only sane way to get this completely correct, with
the trade off of never releasing memory.
