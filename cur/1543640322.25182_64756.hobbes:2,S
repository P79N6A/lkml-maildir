On the other hand, if you are _too_ anal you won't consider _anything_ 
"truly random", and /dev/random becomes practically useless on things that 
don't have special randomness hardware.
To me it sounds from your description that you may well be on the edge of 
"too anal". Real life _has_ to be taken into account, and not accepting 
entropy because of theoretical issues is _not_ a good idea.
Quite frankly, I'd rather have a usable /dev/random than one that runs out
so quickly that it's unreasonable to use it for things like generating
4096-bit host keys for sshd etc.
In particular, if a machine needs to generate a strong random number, and 
/dev/random cannot give that more than once per day because it refuses to 
use things like bits from the TSC on network packets, then /dev/random is 
no longer practically useful.
Theory is theory, practice is practice. And theory should be used to 
_analyze_ practice, but should never EVER be the overriding concern.
So please also do a writeup on whether your patches are _practical_. I 
will not apply them otherwise.
