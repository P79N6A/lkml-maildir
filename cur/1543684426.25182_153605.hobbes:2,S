Well, we do not take i_sem on parent directory of source filename for sys_link, I think.
So we might endup in sys_link() with inode that is already deleted/being deleted (and nlink==0).
Actually, I naturally thought that only i_nlink check to be non zero at reiserfs_link time should be
enough, but Chris is sure that we need entire patch, so may be he may add more comments to that.
BTW, looking at vfs_link, this patch (below the message) seems to be natural thing to do, is not it?

It is.
This reiserfs_write_lock/unlock stuff are in fact lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel(),
only I invented those macroses to easy conversion to more fine-grained locking later.
Except that Hans now does not want this to happen.
