When I do a:
% limit
I get:
cputime         unlimited
filesize        unlimited
datasize        unlimited
stacksize       8192 kbytes
coredumpsize    0 kbytes
memoryuse       unlimited               <<----
descriptors     1024
memorylocked    unlimited
maxproc         2047
openfiles       1024
We can see that memory use is unlimited, so it's natural that the thing
blows easily. 
But you mean that even if I set memoryuse to a certain value smaller than
total memory in the system, I can still bomb it with malloc() because in
reality this isn't implemented?
