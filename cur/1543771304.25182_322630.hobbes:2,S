In some cases a comment like "this sucks, but we have to do it
because.." helps.  Example 2 can also be changed to size_t, that one
makes sense.
"grep 'int len'" really is a decent code checker, I agree.  The hard
part is finding the 2% real problems among the output.  And possibly
other cases where s/int/size_t/ doesn't fix anything, but makes
slightly more sense.
