If the box downloads a linux kernel through the DSLAM network, then
someone is clearly distributing linux kernels through the DSLAM network.
I would guess it is the same guys, because relying on someone else providing
them with kernels is a risky business.  But whoever is on the other end
of the DSLAM net have to offer the source as well, because they _are_
distributing kernels.
The fact that the user isn't supposed to know how this box work
doesn't change anything, of course.  The GPL says those who 
distribute the work - it doesn't matter that they don't tell the
customer that they're given a linux kernel. They still have to offer
the source if asked.
