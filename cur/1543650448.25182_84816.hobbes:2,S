Well, Linux wants file data in pages, so you would need to be able to 
get your kernel to point to page-aligned ROM regions.  Otherwise you are 
stuck with the same issues as fs/romfs or fs/cramfs or most other Linux 
filesystems -- you gotta copy the data into a RAM page before the Linux 
VFS will look at it[1].  For the initramfs cpio image itself, it can 
either piggyback inside the kernel image, or be loaded separately via 
bootloader, from ROM, or some other magic means.  Unpacking [what is 
essentially] pointers into the ROM would probably involve custom 
userland code in an initramfs which mounts and populates a ROM-based 
filesystem.
So one way or another you can have all of _your own_ data in ROM, but I 
don't want to paint too rosy a picture -- if you want to be smarter than 
fs/romfs is now, it will take some additional work.  And of course the 
ramfs-based rootfs will still be needed as the underlying writable fs.

[1] or you can create your own file_operations and eliminate this 
restriction... with a bunch of ROM-specific custom code that totally 
bypasses the pagecache
