1394 bus rescanning takes a _lot_ longer than a PCI rescan. If we don't
do this in a kthread, then we have to do it as a tasklet, and take a
chance of stalling for a few seconds (not ms), preventing other
tasklet's from running. Suboptimal, IMO.
Also, neither PCI nor SCSI rescans occur quite as often as 1394 rescans.
It's more like USB (which also uses a kthread, or at least used to).
