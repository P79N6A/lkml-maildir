Subject: [PATCH] Don't start kipmid if the IPMI driver can use interrupts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If the driver has interrupts available to it, there is really no
reason to have a kernel daemon push the IPMI state machine.
Note that I have experienced machines where the interrupts do
not work correctly.  This was a long time ago and hopefully
things are better now.  If some machines still have broken
interrupts, a blacklist will need to be added.
