Current drives have separate read and write portions on the head.  You can
only read with a magnetoresistive head ...

Yes, this was during the OMTI (ST-xxx, I don't recall the number), interface
days, when drives used to do MFM, and the better RLL ...
But even those, as soon as the controller cards got more RAM than 512 bytes
(16 kilobytes were needed, for one track of 17 (MFM) or 26 (RLL) sectors),
all were formatted to 1:1 interleave, because anything else was only slowing
them down.
Interleaving died fairly soon, and as far as I know was never needed since
that time.

Geez, I don't think you got the numbers right. If a harddrive had
a gigabit per linear centimeter, it'd have 3 GB (gigabytes) on
just the outer track ... which isn't the reality. 
Should you be saying something like 0.1 Mbit/cm, I'd believe that.

I did. Quantum says for their current fastest IDE drive: Maximum internal
data rate: 241 Mb/sec. That's megabit per second. And, that makes it 30 MB
per second, which the drive will easily transfer to the host over it's
UDMA66 interface.

I can't agree with you here. Should the data be too fast for the interface,
interleaving OF COURSE would help, since for 2:1 you'd read the whole track
in two revolutions instead of one, effectively halving the data rate that
the interface needs to transfer to the host.

It's more likely a necessity. Any other interleave would slow the
drive down, which isn't at all what manufacturers wish. They could
just let it spin slower ...

All disks can do full track buffering now. And, if you think that cylinders
are somewhere in the range of hundreds, then I guess you're off by a couple
orders of magnitude. A track can easily fit into the 512 KB buffer on your
usual IDE drive.

Hmm, then why all manufacturers state it? "Average Rotational Latency: 5.56 ms"

All of the recent ones.
Have fun,
