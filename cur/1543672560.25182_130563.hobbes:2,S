Does anyone know if there's a reason that the ethernet driver initialisation
order has changed again in 2.5?
In 2.2.xx, we had eth0 = NE2000, eth1 = Tulip
In 2.4, we have eth0 = Tulip, eth1 = NE2000
And in 2.5, it's back to eth0 = NE2000, eth1 = Tulip
Both interfaces are on the same bus:
00:0a.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21142/43 (rev 30)
00:0d.0 Ethernet controller: Winbond Electronics Corp W89C940F
Its rather annoying when your dhcpd starts on the wrong interface.
