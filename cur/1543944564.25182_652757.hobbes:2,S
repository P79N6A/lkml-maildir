I don't have CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP defined in .config and there's
not option using menuconfig to select this.
I don't know whether my problem is related or not on Lenovo X60s. I
can power-off on shutdown and suspend-to-ram, but screen turns green,
and doesn't power-off on suspend-to-disk. I've to manually press and
hold the power switch to switch off. System is able to resume later.
It was working as recent as last week, but something changed past few
days.
Jeff.
