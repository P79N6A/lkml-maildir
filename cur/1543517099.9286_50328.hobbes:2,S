Ooops, of course !
But I'm even more puzzled, as it reports:
2.2.9-19 gcc version pgcc-2.91.66 199990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
so it seems to be pgcc, but it calls itsels egcs. What is it really ?

No, nothing in the logs neither about 'update' nor 'dbflush', but I noticed in the /etc/inittab
that /sbin/update has been commented out:
# Things to run in every runlevel. 
## Linux Mandrake: 
# Obsolete with 2.2.9 kernel. #
#ud::once:/sbin/update                                                          
is it normal ? What is new in 2.2.9 that makes update obsolete ?

Me too, I'd like to know ! I have now 4 servers on RH5.2 (no problems so far) and 4 with Mandrake 6.0
at customer sites, all of them with Oracle databases. I experienced a *lot* of data corruption with
the laters. As I told you, a system crash usually means rollback segments corruption. But I had weirder
things:
one day, a filesystem appeared corrupted, in a table segment. I was able to export it while skipping
the corrupted block. So then I rebuilt from scratch the database and started the import, and a few
seconds later, it told me that an index creation failed because of block corruption. I rebooted the
system, recreated the database an then did the import smoothly.
Oracle support (France) told me of disabling asynchronous I/O, as it appeared buggy (many reports of
corruption on Solaris, but also other Unices). So I did it on *all* the sites I administer. But they
didn't want to foward the problem to Oracle World Wide support, as they cannot make a test suite to
reproduce the problem.
With all of that, I suspected memory corruption from oracle itself, but found nothing related in newsgroups,
then memory corruption with Linux, no report about it neither, then inconsistant bdflush. I think the
later would explain lot of things. (I had too a customer reporting the loss of half a day of work after
a system crash, though Oracle logs showed a successful recovery).
Here I am.
I will follow your suggestion of building gcc (but which version ?) and recompile a 2.2.13 kernel with it,
but it's hard to know if the problem goes away, until next crash/corruption.
Oh, another strange thing: the files created at 8:30am "disapeared", but the /var/log/message file has been
correctly written every half hours (MARK) until the power fail.
Waiting to hear from you,
Many thanks,
François Désarménien
