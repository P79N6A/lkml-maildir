Maybe this is not the problem. I could reproduce the problem on my desk
station, an Alpha with 576MB ram. It appeared that it was just a problem
of maximum process per user: when you already have 256 process (the
maximum default per user), vfork() reports ENOMEM. A "make -j" on the
kernel would fail with "vfork: out of memory". A minor modification to
include/linux/tasks.h corrected the problem.
