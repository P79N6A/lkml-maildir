A) Fast has nothing to do with it, ECC runs at the same speed as non-ECC;
B) As I said above, "if your apps don't have built in integrity checks then
   ECC is pretty much a requirement";
C) As I said above, we use our systems for BK development, so this choice
   makes sense for us.
I think the point you are really missing is that it is not an either/or
choice.  All you really need in practice is one application which is
both heavily used and has integrity checks.  It could be BitKeeper or
something else, all that matters is that it will detect memory problems.
That application will flush out your memory problems.  Yeah, you could
get burned before that app finds them and if you are worried about that,
then run ECC.  I think it's an interesting data point, however, that I
care deeply about data integrity and I've transitioned from insisting 
on ECC to not caring.  If my choice wasn't working for me, I would 
still be using ECC.  In other words, I'm a lot closer to your way of
thinking than you might expect.
