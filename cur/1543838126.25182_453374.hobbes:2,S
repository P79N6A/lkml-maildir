Good instinct :-)

First, try to recast all your objects as pages, as Evgeniy Polyakov
suggested.  Then if there is some place where that just doesn't work
(please point it out) put a mempool there and tweak the high level
reservation setup accordingly.

If we waste a little space only where the network would have otherwise
dropped a packet, that is still a big win.  We just need to be sure the
normal path does not become more wasteful.

High order allocations are just way too undependable without active
defragmentation, which isn't even on the horizon at the moment.  We
just need to treat any network hardware that can't scatter/gather into
single pages as too broken to use for network block io.
As for sk_buff cow break, we need to look at which network paths do it
(netfilter obviously, probably others) and decide whether we just want
to declare that the feature breaks network block IO, or fix the feature
so it plays well with reserve accounting.

You need to avoid the temptation to fix the entire world on the first
attempt.  Sure, there will be people who call for gobs of overengineering
right from the start, but simple has always worked better for Linux than
lathering on layers of complexity just to support some feature that may
arguably be broken by design.  For example, swapping through a firewall.
Changing from per-interface to a global block IO reserve was a great
simplification, we need more of those.
Looking forward to -v5 ;-)
