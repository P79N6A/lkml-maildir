This, I assume, is the upper fs

yup.
Interesting problem.  I don't suppose that it'd be appreiated if I were to
commend the use of O_DIRECT for handling the lower fs ;)
Let me think about that a bit, after I've made the latest shitpile people
have inflicted upon me begin to look like it has a chance of compiling.
