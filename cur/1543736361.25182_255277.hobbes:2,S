when I've said you will not be asked for a password, I meant during
boot. my desktop machine will never annoy me asking me for a swap
password. Of course on the laptop (but _only_ on the laptop, since I
never use suspend on anything by the laptop) suspend/resume will have to
ask for a password for suspend/resume to work safely (this secondary
password choosen by the user, will encrypt the primary random swap
password). This should be safe.

saving it to the disk is not safe. It really has to be choosen by the
user. Maybe for suspend we could try to search for active cryptoloops
or dm-crypt, and re-use the same password, to avoid asking the user.
That would be ok. But resume definitely has to ask to the user.
I doubt we can make it with lilo/grub, if we do that we should probably
nuke it somehow from /proc/cmdline, allowing all users in the system to
see the cleartext password doesn't sound secure enough. More likely the
kernel should stop and ask the user to type something and then read the
swap header and find a magic-check block and see if the password can
decrypt the magic block.

random keys are exactly fine, but only for the swap usage on a desktop
machine (the one I mentioned above, where the user will not be asked for
a password), but it's not ok for suspend/resume, suspend/resume needs
a regular password asked to the user both at suspend time and at resume
time.
