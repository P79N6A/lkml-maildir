just to add that I removed the immutable test for almost the same reason:
a) we don't hit that test because permission takes care of it (for
regulars/dirs/symlinks but here only regulars are important)
b) the error returned by permission EACCES makes a lot more sense than
EPERM we were trying to return. I already quotes Single UNIX v2 to explain
why.
Now, here is the same patch, except:
a) tested under test12-pre7
b) I suggest we explain why we return EPERM for append-only files despite
the fact that SuS and common sense suggest EACCES.
Facts verified under FreeBSD 4.2
The rationale for being compatible with 4.4BSD on append-only but not on
immutable is -- for immutable we can do the test by means of permission()
fast but for append-only we would need an extra if() above permission so
let's just be BSD-compatible.  Alternatively, one could ignore BSD
altogether and return EACCES in both. Or, one could ignore SuS altogether
and return EPERM for both immutable and append-only. It is a matter of
taste so... I chose something in the middle , perhaps non-intuitive but
optimized for speed and the size of code.

Tigran
