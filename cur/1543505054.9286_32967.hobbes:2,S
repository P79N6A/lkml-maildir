Whatever it does, it cannot work correctly.
Either it tries to allocate too much (everything), or not enough. The
basic problem is that it really isn't how a driver works.
It can cerainly be thought of as a _helper_ function for one specific
common case, but it cannot and should not be thought upon as the
fundamental form of resource allocation. If a driver wants to just
allocate the ports by hand, that makes in my opinion as much if not more
sense than to call a "acquire_pci_dev" thing.
