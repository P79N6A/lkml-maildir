Actually, I partly take that back. The Seagate _does_ honor drive write
back caching disable and it does show a nice improvement with NCQ for
that case. Results are as follows:
8 thread io case, 4kb block size, noop io scheduler, ST3120827AS.
Write cache off:
                Depth 1         Depth 30        Diff
Seq read:       18.94           21.51           +  14%
Ran read:        0.86            1.24           +  44%
Seq write:       6.58           19.30           + 193%
Ran write:       1.00            1.27           +  27%
Write cache on:
                Depth 1         Depth 30        Diff
Seq read:       18.78           21.58           +  15%
Ran read:        0.84            1.20           +  43%
Seq write:      24.49           23.26           -   5%
Ran write:       1.55            1.63           +   5%
Huge benefit on writes with NCQ when write back caching is off, with it
on I think the deviation is within standard jitter of this benchmark.
