 ISA interrupts get their numbers from 8259A IRQ numbers they would be
routed to in the PIC mode.  This lets the code operate in the mixed mode
sanely (which happens for certain hardware), although it's not necessarily
the reason for the numbering used.  Note that the MP Specification does
not mandate an identity map of ISA interrupts, although it seems to be
what vendors do.
 Also note that depending on the configuration, the timer can effectively
be routed to INTIN2 or INTIN0 by Linux -- one of the alternatives being a
direct connection and the other one being done through the 8259A
configured to be transparent for its IRQ 0.

 This can't be done for the timer due to configuration variations.

 Hmm, that's unfortunate.  Couldn't the interpreter be started earlier?
