Thanks.  We considered adding a ratelimit flag to the netdev_printk arg
list.  It was pointed out that
(1) rate-limiting is necessary for a relatively small subset of messages;
and
(2) the NETIF_MSG_* flags are already designed to be used in order of
increasing verbosity.  If the user selects the more verbose class of
messages, then rate-limiting may not be appropriate.
I concluded that ratelimit() should continue to be used on a case-by-case
basis, and not folded into netdev_printk.
