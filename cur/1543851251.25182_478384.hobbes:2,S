Cpusets certainly enjoys what I would call hierarchical process
containers.  I can't tell if your flat container space is just
a "for instance", or you're recommending we only have a flat
container space.
If the later, I disagree.

Yup - sure sounds like you're advocating a flat container space
accessed by system calls.
Sure doesn't sound right to me.  I like hierarchical containers,
accessed via like a file system.
