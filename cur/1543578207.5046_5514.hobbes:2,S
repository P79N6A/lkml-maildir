Sorry, no ext2fs in this kernel (it is for a diskless embedded system). I seem
to recall though that the problem at one point magically went away when I
disabled the FPU emulation, but I have not been able to reproduce this
recently, so I'm not sure. Making minor changes to the kernel code (such as
adding/removing some test-prints) certainly does not affect the behavior.

What could I do to check/fix this ?

I have put a "halting statement" (i.e. "while(1);") after my printouts to make
sure execution does not go any further than that point. I moved this halting
statement ahead in the code line by line until the crash would occur again.
So, yes, I am pretty sure.

According to my System.map file, mem_map is at 0xc0244f78. Does that help ?
