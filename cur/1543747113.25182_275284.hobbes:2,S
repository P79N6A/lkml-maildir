With CAP_SYS_RAWIO I can ask the IDE controller to DMA into the kernel
as one example. Without it should be sane. However if you take away all
the capabilities then you don't need the other changes because mount
works just fine.

Yes I realise that but you also need to realise that glibc has a lot of
supporting baggage it likes to find if its going to function sanely. Yes
you can deal with it but SELinux can deal with it better.

I don't see it as orthogonal except for the "done by user" aspect. "foo"
isnt allowed to open files or chdir is SELinux policy at work (or for
that matter the rather nice bitmap filtered syscall stuff Andrea was
talking about some time back).
BTW: you also have to deal with fchdir() and potentially AF_UNIX
sockets.
