My fear is that you may encounter an indefinite number of buggy apps,
which expect an mmap() to follow the mmap() before: easy bug to commit,
and to go unnoticed, until you reverse the layout.
As to where to place your stack: I don't know what assumptions are made
elsewhere, but a seemingly good place is just below the program's text
at 0x08048000.  People sometimes ask why i386 ELF text is usually placed
there: I think it's a convention of some other UNIX implementations,
which used to put stack below text and data above it, all sharing
the one page table (if it's a smallish process).
