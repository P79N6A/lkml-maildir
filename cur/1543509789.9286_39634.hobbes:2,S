I get the same thing.  I've looked at it and concluded that this
is due to linux's performing readahead, but trying to readahead
beyond the end of the file.  I sent mail to the list asking if
that was supposed to be happening, and that the warning should
just be deleted, but haven't gotten any reply, yet.
It's probably safe for you to ignore the warnings for now, but it
would be nice if someone who understood the read-ahead code would
clarify if the warning is spurious, or if the read-ahead should
be stopping at the end of the file.
