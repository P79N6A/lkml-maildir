You'll find it documented on RedHat's Bugzilla (can't remember the
exact reference - sorry). Basically the first RH-7.3 kernels were
causing a DOS on a couple of Netapps w/ Gigabit connections.
The DOS was traced to a combination of Linux flooding the server with
all these fragments w/o headers (our bug), coupled with inadequate
garbage collection of said fragments on the Netapp side (their bug).
Cheers,
