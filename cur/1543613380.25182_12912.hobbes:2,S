Correct me if I'm wrong, but that looks like cdrecord doesn't recognize your 
cd-rom correctly. Do you have added that drive also to your lilo.conf ?
Normally it would be enough to load the modules without any specific parameters.
Could you post your dmesg-output + lilo.conf parameters if possible ?
