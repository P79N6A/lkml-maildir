Hi
I am trying to get working a Spacec@m 300 (USB) by Trust. I tried this
under 2.2.18 and 2.4.3. In order to get the camera detected I can use the
usb-uhci or uhci module (the result is the same). The camera gets detected
(some OV7610 gets probed - I don't know if this is the correct one) and
after loading the ov511 module I get the picture of the camera displayed
with xawt-3.38 (resolution 640x480 - the camera is able to this). 
The problem I am running into is that the framerate is extremely slow
(maybe 3 fps), however, from the specifications it should work with 30
fps. My system is a Pentium II with 300 Mhz. Some Miro TV card with a
BT848 chip works fine with the bttv driver. 
Do you have any idea ? 
If you need more info, just let me know. I am also willing to do some
tests...
