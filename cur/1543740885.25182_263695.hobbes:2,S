What has this to do with the kernel? More relevant on X server, OpenGL or GPGPU lists?
Baseline - I can get accelerated 3D graphics and video overlay
and YV12 and VGA registers with open source driver that compiles
for PowerPC and DEC Alpha today for $85 - Radeon 7500 PCI. 
X.org 'ati' driver at 
http://x.org

If you can improve on that then I will buy one for each of my Alpha and PowerPC systems.

 are programming multivendor graphics cards for
general purpose computing BUT the toolchain involves a proprietary
compiler which is single platform.
What good is a card with open source hardware and open source
driver that is programmable BUT the toolchain is proprietary?
