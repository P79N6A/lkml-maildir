Do not enable vga16, vesafb and riva together. Decided for only one
of them, and use just that one. Although your configuration should give
you /dev/fb0 on riva, /dev/fb1 on vesafb and /dev/fb2 on vga16,
it looks like that you got reordered framebuffers somehow. Did not you
pass 'video=vga16fb:XXXX' option to the kernel? What kernel cmdline you 
used?
Other possibility is that vga16 setup confused your hardware enough for
picture to disappear... Doing 'cat /proc/fb > /non-working-fbs;
dmesg >> /non-working-fbs' after you boot your system with non-working
display could give us clue what's going on. But in any case, do not use
more than one fbdev...
