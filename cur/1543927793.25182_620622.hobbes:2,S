So what? We are in the case where the data has already gotten to him. If it
got to him in error, he'll reject it anyway. The receive checksum check will
only reject packets that he would reject anyway. That makes it needless.
Of course, if the check is nearly free, there's no potential win, so no
point in bothering.
