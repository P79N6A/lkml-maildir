The p->state variable for EXIT_ZOMBIE is only live for some mystery architecture
in arch/xtensa/kernel/ptrace.c
It could be a typo under architecture so maybe it's better fixed there as well
with a "state" to "exit_state" change. I don't really know for sure since I don't
work under that architecure.
