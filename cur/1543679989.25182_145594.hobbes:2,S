To complete on this topic : I've got the problem since 2.5.70, when
netdev_wait_allrefs has been introduced in net/core/dev.c
I have the same behavior using vtund, configured to create a tap0
interface.
At shutdown time, the interface refuses to get freed and I'm stuck.
Having vtund started at boot time (within the /etc/rc.d/... stuff)
or later doesn't make any difference.
Shutting down the interface before stopping the application or halting
the machine doesn't make any difference either.
The other problem is that the current implementation of 
netdev_wait_allrefs makes that if you kill an application that is
using a device not correctly counted, you lock the console you are
working on.
e.g., killing vtund will create a printk(... unregister_netdevice...),
and the console cannot be used anymore as long as the counter hasn't
reached 0 and the device is freed...
