ia32 with HZ=100 means sleep will sleep for 10ms each time, no less.
The time passed to slect is a _minimum_ the kernel make no guarantee
it will be less, but assures it will be more (10ms is the default
timer interval for the intel platform, others (e.g. alpha) differ)
run your conde with strace -t to see what i mean
