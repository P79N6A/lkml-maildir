So, let's see if I've got this right: You want to see the operating
system universally referred to as Gnu/Linux, right ???
To the best of my knowledge, "GNU" and "Gnu" are trademarks belonging
the Free Software Foundation (which you control), while "Linux" is a
trademark belonging to one Linus Torvalds, who is NOT employed by the
Free Software Foundation.
If this is true, then the ONLY LEGAL way for those two trademarks to
be coupled to the same product is for the owner of one of them to sell
their trademark to the owner of the other one, and for that owner to
then decide to attach both trademarks to the product in question. This
is most certainly true under both English and Scottish law, and I am
led to understand that it also applies under both Canadian and US law,
and may even be enshrined in International Law.
Mr Stallman: Unless you have recently bought the trademark "Linux"
from Mr Linus Torvalds, ANY attempt by your good self to couple the
two trademarks together makes you a criminal in the eyes of the law,
and gives Mr Torvalds the right to sue you for misuse of his
trademark.
It would be appreciated if you could clarify this situation, as I
don't like to think of anybody as being a criminal if they are not.
Best wishes from Riley.
