Hi,
For some APIC code rework I would like to collect some statistics on
VIA APIC setups.
If you have a system with VIA chipset running a recent (2.6.16+) x86-64 kernel 
please boot the system with apic=verbose on the kernel command and send me
- boot output (/var/log/boot.msg or dmesg -s100000000 output after boot)
- dmidecode output
- lspci  -v output
Thanks,
-Andi
