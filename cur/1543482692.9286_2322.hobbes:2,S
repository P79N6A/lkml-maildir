I had an NE2000 PCI card in my machine RTI chipset I believe.  It worked
fine under a uniprocessor kernel but under SMP and heavy load it simply
stopped working.  I appoligize but I needed the machine to work so I
swapped network cards for a tulip which works fine now but I am no longer
able to do any testing.  It was still a problem in 2.2.0-pre3.
To reproduce the problem on an SMP machine just flood the machine with
pings and they should eventualy fail.  Large fast ftp transfers should
also cause the problem.
