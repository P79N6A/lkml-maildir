I'd disagree with Christoph on that.  Being able to set the scheduling
policy from a module-based kernel thread is a sensible thing to be able to
do, and you can do it by issuing a direct trap anyway.
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() would be preferred.
Possibly it could be done by adding a variant of kthread_create() which has
a new `policy' argument, but it doesn't really seem worth the fuss.
