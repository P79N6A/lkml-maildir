   You likely have the mpt module referenced in your /etc/modules.conf.  
Likely this is something like a scsi_hostadapter alias.  When the 
install script attempts to create an initrd it fails as it can't find 
the module in question.  This could be caused by one of several things.
1)You didn't compile support for the mpt driver at all.
2)You compiled the driver into the kernel instead of as a module.
  In the case of #2 commenting out the alias in modules.conf should 
"fix" your issue.  (Of course new kernel's from your vendor won't know 
to load the driver.)  Or you could just manually install the kernel.  In 
the case of #2 you really need to compile the mpt driver.
