Predictable IP IDs is not just a question about losing packets because
attackers can create junk fragments.
There are other possible attacks.  For example predictable IP IDs can be used
to completely bypass TCP connection security based on unpredictable TCP sequence
numbers.  Tools exploiting this weakness already exist.  See

And I'm sure that other ways to abuse predictable IP ID will appear in the
future.

I don't see real performance penalty.  I agree that I've added a big amount
of code to the kernel but it's a cost of a robust solution.
