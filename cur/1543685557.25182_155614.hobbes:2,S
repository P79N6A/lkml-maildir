I made a patch that lets all broken drivers depend on an (undefined) 
BROKEN symbol and all drivers that don't compile on SMP on a 
BROKEN_ON_SMP symbol that is only defined if !SMP.
This (undefined) BROKEN_MODULAR was an attempt to express that a driver
compiles only statically.

It's too complicated to be actually useful, but it seems I'd then need a
config BLK_DEV_PS2_TRISTATE
	tristate "PS/2 ESDI hard disk support"
	depends on BROKEN_MODULAR
	default y if BLK_DEV_PS2=y
	default m if BLK_DEV_PS2=m
config BLK_DEV_PS2_BOOL
	bool "PS/2 ESDI hard disk support"
	depends on !BROKEN_MODULAR
	default y if BLK_DEV_PS2=y
config BLK_DEV_PS2
	default y if BLK_DEV_PS2_TRISTATE=y || BLK_DEV_PS2_BOOL
	default m if BLK_DEV_PS2_TRISTATE=m
Alternatively it might work with BLK_DEV_PS2_TRISTATE and
BLK_DEV_PS2_BOOL using select.
My problem isn't that important to satisfy such a complicated construct,
I can accept that there's no easy way to express this and live without
it.
