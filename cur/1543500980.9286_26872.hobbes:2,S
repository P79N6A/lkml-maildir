	I've notice a problem with 2.2 kernels when using loopback mount devices.
	Specifically, when I unmount, the fs is unmounted and removed from the
	/proc/mounts listing, but the underlying fs still reports the old mount
	point as being busy and the underlying fs can't be unmounted.
	ps: I think the loop device itself is busy too.
User error. Read mount(8) and losetup(8).
Use losetup -d if you use mount/umount in such a way
that the losetup -d is not done automatically.
Do not use a symlink to /proc/mounts as /etc/mtab
if you want mount to do the losetup -d for you.
