We have multiple reports of PS/2 mouse port not being found
on Sis 630 and 730 chipsets, starting with Fedora kernel 2.6.19:
2.6.18:
Jan 19 08:59:39 mtranch kernel: PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBC,PNP0f13:PS2M]
at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
Jan 19 08:59:39 mtranch kernel: serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
Jan 19 08:59:39 mtranch kernel: serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Jan 19 08:59:39 mtranch kernel: mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
2.6.19:
Jan 20 09:22:30 mtranch kernel: PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBC,PNP0f13:PS2M]
at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
Jan 20 09:22:30 mtranch kernel: serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Jan 20 09:22:30 mtranch kernel: mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
I'm pretty sure Fedora doesn't patch any input code, so I wonder
if some change was made here that could cause this?
