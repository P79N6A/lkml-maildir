A regression since when, I wonder?  Please do NOT waste any time
bisecting, but I'd be interested to know which release or -rc you
previously found it worked on.
When I gave the code a quick look, it appeared to be something
which has long been wrong; but I didn't investigate whether per-cpu
allocation has changed recently.  My _suspicion_, no more than that,
is that it might be a regression to you because you're now forced
to have CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y where you didn't need it before.
Anyway, it doesn't matter too much what it's a regression since:
it's a bug that needs fixing whatever, and should be simple.
My x86_64 was running other tests yesterday which I didn't want
to interrupt, but I'll take a look later on today.
