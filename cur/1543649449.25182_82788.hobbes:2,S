Don't assume we all want what you want.
As for allowed, it can
be worked around fairly easily by removing all protocol handlers and
then registering only yourself as the proprietary protocol handler,
and gobble all packets.  Sure, it's a bit of a kludge, and will have
the various crufts (like the gettimeofday code) in there, but it
will basically allow you to replace the entire stack.
If I'm right about that, then what is the difference between replacing
the stack like that and replacing the netif_rx method entirely?
