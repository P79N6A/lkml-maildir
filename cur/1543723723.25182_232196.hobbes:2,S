Hi Zack, 
Silly me, its not possible to compile SMP image without CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT (a lot of
SMP detection code is linked to basic ACPI infrastructure).
Can you please try the nolapic/noapic boot options? They should disable the APIC, and
if APIC is the "root" of your crashes, we will find out that way.
Sorry for the noise.
