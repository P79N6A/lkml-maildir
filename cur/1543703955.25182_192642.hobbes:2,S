So something like this will work for you ???
void *
pcireg_xxx_soft_get(ptr)
{
        return __pcireg_xxx_get(ptr->bs_base, ptr->bs_bridge_type);
}
void *
pcireg_xxx_get(ptr)
{
        return __pcireg_xxx_get(ptr, IS_TIO(ptr) ? BT_TIO : BT_PIC);
}
static void *
__pcireg_xxx_get(bridge_t *bridge, int type)
{
     switch (type ) {
        case BT_TIO:
            return bridge_addr->ti_xxx;
        case BT_PIC:
            return bridge->addr->pic_xxx;
        default:
            /* */
    }
