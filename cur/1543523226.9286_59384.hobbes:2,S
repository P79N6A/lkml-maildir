Hi Alan
I'm not sure what you mean by 'legal', however it does break software that
depends on constant inodes such as tar -g. This means I can't use linux to
do incremental backups of vfat filestore (or any other fat filestore) using
tar -g. I see this as a step backwards for fat filestore compatibility. Is
there someway I can undo the change?
