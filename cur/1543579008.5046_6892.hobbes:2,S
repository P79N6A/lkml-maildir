That's assuming you are using lilo.  Not everybody does or can use lilo, please
don't assume that the way your system gets booted is the way everybody's does,
particularly those on platforms other than the x86.
I must say, as a 5 year Linux user (and 23 year UNIX user/administrator), I do
get tired of having to hunt down and deal with each of these changes that come
up from time to time with Linux (ie, switching from ipfwadm to ipchains to
netfilter, or in this case reordering how scsi adapters/network adapters are
looked up).

I'm an end-user, and I have 3 scsi-adapters of two different brands in my
system.  Many of the people using Linux in high end things like servers,
etc. will have multiple scsi controlers.  People are using Linux in lots of
things from small embedded devices to large systems, and Linux needs to address
needs in every area.
