Just to confirm now, I have modified Zwane's patch add another kernel arg,
[no]locapictimer, which deals with dont_use_local_apic_timer in the same
way his patch deals with the dont_enable_local_apic flag, and indeed, a
kernel booted with "nolapic" does hang in the APIC timer calibration
however a kernel booted with "nolocapictimer" does not.
Is it really valid to go and try to calibrate the APIC timer if it was
disabled by the user, or even DMI?
