I had the same kind of problem on the Alpha, luckely the FAQ helped. It
seems the
scanner I had (Mustek 600) does not do SCSI-disconnects and thus hangs
the bus
when the kernel tries to swap the very big image...
Solution I did was telling the SCSI driver the scanner could'nt do
disconnects
(disc:n) and writing the file to an NFS drive...
This works till I scan stuff which is bigger than the 88MB memory :)
