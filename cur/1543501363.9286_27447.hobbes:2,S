A number of times in which performance have been realized in kernel
development has resulted in pushing marginal processors over the edge.
If the processor has to work harder its going to get hotter. This usually
bites the over-clockers who have been getting away running beyond spec and
now blame the kernel undeservedly. I would try dropping the clock to see
what happens if you have not done so already.
