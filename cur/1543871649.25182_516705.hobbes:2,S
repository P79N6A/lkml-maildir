Uh, duh yes I don't mean MAP_ANONYMOUS, I was just thinking of the shmem
inode that sits behind MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_SHARED. Of course if you don't
have a file descriptor to get a pgoff, then remap_file_pages is a doorstop
for everyone ;)

Yeah, tmpfs/shm segs are what I was thinking about. If UML can live with
that as well, then I think it might be a good option.
