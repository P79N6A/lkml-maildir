Was missing the very first line (dentry->d_inode). I just saw you already 
suggested returning 0 for them, which I'm gonna do anyway.
But, actually, procfs returns ENOENT (or EINVAL) rather than creating negative 
dentries (at least, I've examined most of procfs lookup funcs, hope I haven't 
missed any)...
And actually, after realizing the procfs trick, I see that we, too should miss 
negative dentries, because on the "uncached" path when we get an error like 
that we propagate that, and on the "cached" one obviously we can't find them 
in dcache.
Right?
I'll do the check for negative dentries anyway because depending on procfs 
details is not on my TODO list.
Yes, we could, but given the unmaintainance level of HPPFS, nobody would ever 
fix it when needed, and that's not recommended.
