I should have read my work email first.  I had gotten an email from
one of our MPT developers saying they would love it if they could share
file backed memory areas as well as it would help them with their MPI-IO
functions which currently need to do multiple copy steps.  Not sure how
high of a priority I am going to be able to make that.
