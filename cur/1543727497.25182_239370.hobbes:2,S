There is no rant. The threads on LKML become often too large so it is
essential to have a structure in them. Your mail client breaks this
structures while almost everybody else cares about it.

What's the point? ASCII is the "official US alphabet encoding" so does
that mean that you have to avoid any other chars (eg. the one in your
name)? Or how many people use ash, the spartanic "POSIX compliant"
shell for daily work? Reality check please.
Regards,
Eduard.
