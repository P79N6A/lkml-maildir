Subject: [rfc][patch 2/2] x86_64: FIFO ticket spinlocks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/16/7

Introduce ticket lock spinlocks for x86-64 which are FIFO. The implementation
is described in the comments. The straight-line lock/unlock instruction
sequence is slightly slower than the dec based locks on modern x86 CPUs,
however the difference is quite small on Core2 and Opteron when working out of
cache, and becomes almost insignificant even on P4 when the lock misses cache.
trylock is more significantly slower, but they are relatively rare.
The memory ordering of the lock does conform to Intel's standards, and the
implementation has been reviewed by an Intel engineer.
XXX: numbers here
The algorithm also tells us how many CPUs are contending the lock, so
lockbreak becomes trivial and we no longer waste 4 bytes per spinlock for it.
