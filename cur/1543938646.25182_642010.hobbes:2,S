Subject: [PATCH 0/3] percpu: Optimize percpu accesses
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset provides the following:
  * Generic: Percpu infrastructure to rebase the per cpu area to zero
    This provides for the capability of accessing the percpu variables
    using a local register instead of having to go through a table
    on node 0 to find the cpu-specific offsets.  It also would allow
    atomic operations on percpu variables to reduce required locking.
  * x86_64: Fold pda into per cpu area
    Declare the pda as a per cpu variable. This will move the pda
    area to an address accessible by the x86_64 per cpu macros.
    Subtraction of __per_cpu_start will make the offset based from
    the beginning of the per cpu area.  Since %gs is pointing to the
    pda, it will then also point to the per cpu variables and can be
    accessed thusly:
	%gs:[&per_cpu_xxxx - __per_cpu_start]
  * x86_64: Rebase per cpu variables to zero
    Take advantage of the zero-based per cpu area provided above.
    Then we can directly use the x86_32 percpu operations. x86_32
    offsets %fs by __per_cpu_start. x86_64 has %gs pointing directly
    to the pda and the per cpu area thereby allowing access to the
    pda with the x86_64 pda operations and access to the per cpu
    variables using x86_32 percpu operations.
Based on 2.6.24-rc8-mm1
