interesting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to try on the machine I told
you about last day. But right here, I have a dual athlon communicating with
an alpha, both with e1000 (544) in 2.4.26. Since there's a PCI bridge on your
quad, I wonder if the IOAPIC doesn't trigger an interrupt routing problem with
bridges. Are all the ports unusable or do some of them work reliably in APIC
mode ?
Cheers,
Willy
