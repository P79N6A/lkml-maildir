this is exactly the job done by my June 99 patch.
It subdivides runnable tasks in priority "slots" ( clusters ) so to find the
best one You search into the higher available and if You find one You can stop
Your loop having found the _next_.
This way to handle the search gives the same speedup as the hashing do versus
linked lists (  logarithmic  vs. linear ).
And the results of my tests prove this.
Cheers,
	Davide.
