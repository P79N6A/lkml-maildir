I can't get it to run on x86_64. The kernel won't build with
"voluntary preemption" enabled, it's complaining about mce_read_sem
being undeclared. Including linux/semaphore.h in
arch/x86_64/kernel/mce.c does get the compilation past that point, but
later on mtrr and kprobes won't build. I can turn those off, but the
build stops on kernel/printk.c with a "console_sem undeclared" error.
Everything builds fine with "real-time preemption" enabled, though the
linux system as a whole still won't run, as init crashes on startup
(kernel panic).
I saw earlier postings on lkml related to RT and x86_64, but
unfortunately the suggestions made, such as turning off latency
timing, didn't help. I tried this on a dual Xeon HT server with SLES
9.1 64bit installed (config has SMP/SMT set to yes). I used the
2.6.13-rc4 kernel patched with
realtime-preempt-2.6.13-rc4-RT-V0.7.52-10.
Any suggestions or any extra info I've missed would be appreciated.
