You can define it as follows:
1) If entry exists in COMPAT or TRANSLATE table, invoke
   fops->ioctl(), else
2) If ->compat_ioctl() exists, invoke that, else
3) Fail.
The COMPAT tables are sort of valuable, in that it eliminates
the need to duplicate code when all of a drivers ioctls need
no translation.
BTW, need to extend this to netdev->do_ioctl as well for the
handling of SIOCDEVPRIVATE based stuff.  Oh goody, we can finally
fix up that crap :))))
