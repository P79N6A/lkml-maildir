Since a user of scsi_execute_async() would most likely want to have
control over this, it would be better to add a parameter and fix the
current users of the function.
However, if we take this route we might have duplicate code
across mid-layer drivers (sg, st, osst), because they may choose to
prioritize I/Os in similar ways.
So instead of adding a parameter, we can make scsi_execute_async()
decide for itself based on the SCSI command, with read/write I/Os
taking the lowest priority.
Suggestions?
