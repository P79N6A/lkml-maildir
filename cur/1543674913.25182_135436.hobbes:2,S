   Ok, so the flush_dcache_page() interface looses this; the original
   placement of the flush_page_to_ram() ensured that data written by
   device drivers was visible to user space.
That's possible, but see my response to Roman's posting for how
this can be easily fixed using current interfaces yet retaining
identical or even potentially better performance.
