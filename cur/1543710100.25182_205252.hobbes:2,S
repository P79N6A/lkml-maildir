You need to run off the panic events, the config flag IPMI_PANIC_EVENT, 
and it should compile fine.  This is a flag that causes the driver to 
put some information about the panic into an event log in the IPMI 
controller so it can be fetched later.
To do this, the driver needs a way to run each operation to completion 
without scheduling, interrupts. or the like.  It needs this to do send 
the panic event (since you cannot schedule during a panic), although it 
also really needs it to do things like extend the watchdog timer time at 
panic time.  The I2C driver does not currently have this, so it doesn't 
work with this option and the SMBus driver.
I have included a patch from Todd Davis at Intel that adds this function 
to the I2C driver.  I believe Todd has been working on getting this in 
through the I2C driver writers, although the patch is fairly non-intrusive.
However, I have no real way to test this patch.
