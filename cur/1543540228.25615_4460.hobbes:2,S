I have gotten "Castlewood Systems ORBS" on board with Linux today.
Basically they will give me everything and all of there stuff is firmware
based.  This will include the "vender-unique ops-code" for the standard
i/o access points.
There may be some other mini-hard hacks to get all that I need.
The API will stay constant but I may need to expand the taskfile access
"WITHOUT" a completion handler parser (previously a fight).
Thus the current command/task handler will have to used.
I will avoid this at all costs and wait.
This is an informational statement only.
Cheers,
