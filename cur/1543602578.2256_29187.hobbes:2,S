Although the documentation states that always going with little endian is
the easiest solution and what was "decided" on, neither the kernel nor
mkcramfs swabs on a big endian machine.  This is decidedly a problem with
what we're doing, so I wrote a patch to swab the easy and not-quite-so-easy
bitfields such that mkcramfs writes little endian images and the kernel
swabs (if byteorder is defined as big_endian or __MIPSEB__ is defined)..
It looks at the magic to determine whether to swab or not.
We've needed this, so we will have to incorporate this into a parallel
repository if not added to the kernel.  Is there another solution afoot,
or might I submit this patch? (please cc me if you respond)
Thanks,
Brad
