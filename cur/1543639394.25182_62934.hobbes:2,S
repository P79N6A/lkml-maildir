Adding a constant prefix to every label and string will increase the
size of the kernel.  I would much rather find a way for cpp to strip
quotes from a #define, then -DKBUILD_OBJECT=\"unix\" has no problems.
But I don't know any cpp construct to convert KBUILD_OBJECT ("unix") to
bare 'unix' without the quotes.  Undefining conflicting names is tacky
but it has the least (zero) impact on the kernel size.
ps.  The variable name is KBUILD_OBJECT, not KBUILD_MODNAME.  The
comment is wrong.
