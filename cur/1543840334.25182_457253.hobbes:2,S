Yes, that was my suse engineer side talking.  It has _nothing_ to do
with my community work, please don't mix the two.

No, you can _always_ have Novell create a stand-alone kernel module
package if you want them to (and can convince them to, you need to speak
with some project managers to get that to happen...)  You can also do
this on your own, as it is very simple to do and support over time.
Even if this driver went into 2.6.18, you would _still_ have the same
situation from Novell, so I do not see how you bring this up has any
relevance here.
And you don't even know what the next SuSE release will base their
kernel on yet, as it hasn't been decided :)
