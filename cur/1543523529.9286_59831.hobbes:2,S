Oh, talking about alignment, how about anyone familiar with the inner
workings of gcc (2.7.2.3 in this case) tell me why I get this warning for
all newer v2.3.xx kernels:
sched.c:77: warning: alignment of `aligned_data' is greater than maximum
object file alignment
socket.c:182: warning: alignment of `sockets_in_use' is greater than
maximum object file alignment
irq.c:75: warning: alignment of `irq_desc' is greater than maximum object
file alignment
init_task.c:33: warning: alignment of `init_tss' is greater than maximum
object file alignment
Even if everything works fine, I *HATE* warnings.
