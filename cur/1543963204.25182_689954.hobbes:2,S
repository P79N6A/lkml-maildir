Cool;
From what I've experienced out of 2.6.25-rc* to the latest git  with a
macbook pro; 2.6.25-rc7,8,or 9 runs the best i.g.
not as hot, fans don't trip as often, when listening to music, and
then compiling you don't have a skip., suspend works
lircd works, isight works.  As for 2.6.26-rc1 lircd doesnt work for
some reason, isight now works, atheros now works, fglrx does'nt due to
something deep into the kernel was changed(who knows what that might be)
did find the kernel running kind of quieter  but noticed the fans
would rev up every so often (estimation would be around 35 min to 60
min + or - )
probably a new mechanism to cool things down. Sound is working, but
every so often a song sounds as if you have blown out speakers.
I probably will pull the latest git, but after spending countless
hours, trying to get fglrx up and running,  and realizing something
was drastically changed in that area, I've decided to go get some
liquid propulsion and call it a day.
