Take a look at the XFS tree. I wrote IDE kiobuf support for that, and
it simply doesn't take the request the queue before it has been
completed (which may take many start-ups for a huge request). But unless
you can make the prd table bigger (which doesn't make much sense anyway),
I don't see any harm in setting up sg for each iteration.
