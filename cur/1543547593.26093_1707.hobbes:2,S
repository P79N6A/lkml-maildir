Yes, I do understand that. In your approach one does:
a) executes a complex vi macro and makes a decision in each instance for
simple cases of mark_buffer_dirty() usage
and then does 
b) greps for any "non-trivial" usages thereof (like fat_) and does it by
hand.
Ok, I agree, your approach is superiour to mine, where one does just:
a) greps for any (trivial or otherwise) usages of mark_buffer_dirty() (or
anything that looks remotely like it :) and edit it by hand.
