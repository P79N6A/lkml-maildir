Normally /tmp gets "rm -rf"ed in most dists startup scripts
anyway. /var is for local state data ...
But I also would like such options to make power-saving on Laptops
easier (But I would use it for all partitions ...). I also tried to
make my disks spin-down - but I never got this to work nicely (disks
run far too often). Stuff like delayed write would be really nice.
