But in that case you'll just end up blocking on the pipe won't you? I
think Andrew's talking about the syscall itself, which should be 64-bit
surely.
Hmm, with no "offset" parameter, you cannot splice-sendfile >4GB files...
Or am I going crazy? I see, it uses f_pos. Should it use offsets instead?
I guess you covered this in your earlier sys_splice discussions. I'll do
some research.
