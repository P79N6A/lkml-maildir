Nope.  The correct fix is to make the various callers use IS_ERR() to check
the result of this function rather than checking for a NULL return.

Yes, I know.  I've looked over the patches several times, however I know there
may be bugs in there because I may have made assumptions about what I've
written that cause me to overlook things.  It's a danger of checking your own
code:-(

And ideally by someone other than me.  Some of them have been reviewed by
other people, but I'm not sure that all have.
However, I've just had another look through.  ISOFS appears to be the only one
in which I'd missed updating the callers.  I've sent you a patch for it.
Note that I expressed reservations about three filesystems in the cover note
(FAT, HPPFS and HOSTFS), but nothing seems to have come of it.
