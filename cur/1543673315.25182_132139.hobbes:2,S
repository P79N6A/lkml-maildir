You want it secure, never write it to disk.  If that is not an option, 
then all that is written to a disk must be encrypted.  Anything less is 
a placebo.  Anyways as Alan mentioned:
 > 4. Even then data erasure is not guaranteed because of the drive logic
 From the write speed differences I've seen on my own system between 
writing zero filled buffers and random data filled buffers it looks like 
a good number of drives do zero filled block write optimizations.  From 
the efective write rates on a couple of my drives it looks like they are 
just marking the blocks as zero in a master table rather than really 
writing zeros out to them.
