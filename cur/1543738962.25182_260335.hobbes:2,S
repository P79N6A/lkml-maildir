Here is an updated copy of the QStor driver patch for 2.6.9-rc4,
will most points to-date addressed.
The only possible sticky point I know of so far, is that the
SCSI INQUIRY code could be shared with libata-scsi, if some changes
were makde to libata-scsi.  I've email'd Jeff a proposal for that.
But in the meanwhile, we need to get this driver moving.
