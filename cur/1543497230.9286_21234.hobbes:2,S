Sorry for being so long in testing the patch, but sleeping takes a lot
of time.
Well, yes there are differences.
Now, the second prog. gets 30% of CPU instead of 0.1%, but the first one
gets 5% which seems closer to the reality to me.
I have two others programs (still dealing with sound), one of mine which
takes lots of CPU and deal with X at the same time (it's a sound tracker)
and one (midas, a sound player) that is very optimized and only plays
modules, no interactions with X, and i read the source of it, there is
a big pentium optimized code and some tests that I do inside my loops are
done outside in midas, so it _must_ take less cpu. But, it uses the usleep way
(well i think, don't remember exactly) and so it had 0.1% before the patch,
and now gets something like 40 or 50% where my program (a blocking select is
used) gets 10%, so once again i think the patch is wrong.
I am sorry not to be able to help more, but this very specific topic of the
kernel is out of my knowledge, reading the source would be a good solution,
but lack of time for now... Is there a doc somewhere about this (cpu
consumption calculation) ?
Thank you and see you,
Sed.
