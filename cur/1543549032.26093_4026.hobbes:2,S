Yeah. See my other mail - I don't think the patch is needed at all,
although I'm convinced that it would actually hide the problem for the
particular case of INN (zeroing out the partial block is not an issue
there, as truncate will have done it - it's really only protection against
badly behaved software and shouldn't matter to any "regular" use).

Yeah. See my suggested fix in the other mail. We just must not read in
buffers for pages that are already up-to-date.
