There's a document in the Documentation/DocBook/ directory called
writing_usb_drivers that should be a good place to start.  Also take a
look at the linux-usb.org site, where a link to the (a bit outdated, but
still quite good) Linux USB Programmers guide is.
One of these days I'll merge the two...
Hope this helps,
