This is just being silly.  Obviously the user will be able to delete
files from the .undelete directory, and a daemon to do automatic
cleanup was also proposed.  Thinking anything else is just being obtuse.
You could have the unlink() wrapper check that there is still some
free space/quota when it is doing the move, and if not it deletes
old files until there is free space/quota.  The daemon just does this
for you in the background to avoid slowing things down.
Cheers, Andreas
