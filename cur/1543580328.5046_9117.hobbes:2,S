The user-mode port of 2.4.1 is available.
I added support for attaching file descriptors and pts devices to UML serial 
lines and consoles, plus specifying input and output channels separately.  
'no-xterm' can now be duplicated with 'con0=fd:0,fd:1 con=pty'.
There is now page dirty and access bit support.
Fixed various bugs - gdb is now told where the binary really is, rather than 
assuming that it is ./linux, kreiserfsd now exits correctly, rather than 
hanging the system when it returns, and a recursively segfaulting process no 
longer crashes the system.
Several more symbols were exported.
The project's home page is
