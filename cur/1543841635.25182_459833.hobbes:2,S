Again, consider the multi-function cards. On pSeries, I can  only enable 
DMA on a er-slot basis, not a per-function basis. So if one driver
enables DMA before some other driver has reset appropriately, everything
breaks.

I don't understand. Enabling MMIO and enabling DMA both require specific
commands to be sent to the PCI-host bridge. These commands are not a
part of the PCI spec.

I can only enable or disable an entire PCI slot, and not individual PCI
functions. If there are some pins that are shorted, or parity errors or
whatever, I can only turn off the whole card.

The platform. By "electrical reset", I mean "dropping the #RST pin low
for 200mS". Only the platform can do this.

The driver has to choices: it can ask for the electrical reset, by 
returning PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET. But if the driver doesn't need
the electrical reset, then it can return PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER,
and issue whatever device-specific commands it needs to reset.

I have no idea. That's why this driver issues PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET,
which will get it into a fresh system power-on state. Its easy, its
brute-force, it works.
