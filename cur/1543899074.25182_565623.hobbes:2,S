Well, I think we can just make the freezer handle uninterruptible tasks.
If an uninterruptible task is stuck holding a lock that's needed for suspend,
the freezerless suspend will deadlock anyway. :-)
The only reason (I know of) why we don't handle uninterruptible tasks in the
freezer is that we're afraid of the suspend process deadlocking with an
uninterruptible task holding a lock, but AFAICS the probability of such an
event is extremely small.
Also, the powermac suspend will deadlock in such cases, so the fact that
it doesn't deadlock means that they don't occur very often (if at all).
I have a patch for that, will post it in a separate thread in a while.
Greetings,
Rafael
