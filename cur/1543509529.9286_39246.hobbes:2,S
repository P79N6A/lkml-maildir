Subject: smbfs and atmtcp broken when compiled as module in 2.3.x

I got this message "/lib/modules/2.3.18/fs/smbfs.o: unresolved symbol
get_cached_page" when I run "modprobe smbfs" after compiled smbfs as
module.
The "atmtcp" has the similar message but the unresolved symbol is
"atm_init_aal5".
I had found "get_cached_page" removed from file "filemap.c" in 2.3.x but
the prototype remained in "mm.h" .
