I think the reason Badari was looking at it was that some DB guys want
to get some statistics out of there.  They'll certainly care about
HugeTLB pages.
With the HugeTLB prefault mechanism having gone away, we can't assume
that the pages are resident.  So, I don't think just using the VMA's
size will work.
