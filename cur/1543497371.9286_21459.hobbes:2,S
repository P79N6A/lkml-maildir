I'm terribly sorry but I missed sources 2 to 4 (and the parameter to
add_timer_randomness).  In addition, I have grossly underestimated the
cycle clock speed of today's machines. :(((

Yes, I did.  But this shouldn't influence the results, because the data
parameter in add_timer_randomness is not used for entropy estimation.
I would certainly like to end the thread after this, but I've got one
further question:  The implementation of /dev/random assumes that the
output of the SHA-1 hash function is random for random (or almost random)
input.  Neither the people on sci.crypt nor I know of any analysis
of SHA-1 in this direction (which doesn't prove anything of course).
Are there any particular reasons why SHA-1 was chosen to supersede MD5?
(It might indeed become practical to find collisions for MD5 soon,
but this doesn't mean that MD5 is not suitable for applications like
/dev/random.)
