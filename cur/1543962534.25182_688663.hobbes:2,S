Thanks.
They (#ifdef __ARMEB__) are indeed very ugly but I don't know how to
clean them, except by splitting the driver into two (which is worse).
The most used things are #defined and then used without those
__ARMEB__ checks.
Duplicating those functions is effectively splitting into two :-(
Well, perhaps Intel could give us firmware which could convert LE-BE
on the fly while TX/RX, that would make the LE code go away.
Binary-only :-(
OTOH I could convert #if* DEBUG_*, I will look at it.
