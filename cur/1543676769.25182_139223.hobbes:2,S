Subject: [PATCH] loop 7/9 remove blk_queue_bounce
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

What purpose does loop_make_request's blk_queue_bounce serve?  None,
it's just a relic from before the kmaps were added to loop's transfers,
and ties up mempooled resources - in the file-backed case, with no
guarantee they'll soon be freed.  And what purpose does loop_set_fd's
blk_queue_bounce_limit serve?  None, blk_queue_make_request did that.
