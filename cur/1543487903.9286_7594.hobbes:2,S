I'm not surprised that non-free kernel modules have
resulted in a big loophole--because the idea is a loophole
in the first place.  They enable a kernel to support more hardware,
at the cost of not being entirely free anymore.
The whole package becomes "more useful" by implicitly altering the
goal (a free operating system).  Now, if we want to achieve that goal,
we have a big effort on our hands.
Linus, if he wants to, could begin closing the loophole, by attaching
more restrictive statements about non-free modules to future kernel
releases.  There are many different ways this could be done, to close
the loophole either more or less.
