I disagree, if only because of backwards competibility issues.
On a conceptual level I think you're right. However, it will break too 
many standard installations as is.
If/when we have a reasonable initrd setup that is usable, we could do some 
automatic partitioning of devices that are available at bootup to minimize 
the impact, but I don't think it is realistic otherwise.
