| No, that's silly.  Why do you want to multiply by HZ and then divide by HZ?
OK, I don't get it.  All Ed did was replace 1000 with HZ and
999 with (HZ-1).  What's bad about that?  Seems to me like
the right thing to do.  Much more portable.
What if HZ changes?  Who's going to audit the kernel for changes?
