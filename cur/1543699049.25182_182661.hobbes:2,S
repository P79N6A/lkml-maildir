Hello!
Now that my IO-APIC finally works without lockups (thanks to all!) on
my nforce2 boards, my interrupts are much less crowded. However,
there's still one line in /proc/interrupts which I don't really like,
it's also the only line where more than one piece of hardware shares
the same interrupt:
 18:     445160   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3, eth0
ide2 and ide3 are my onboard Silicon Image SATA controller. I guess
you can't keep them apart on to different interrupts, since it's only
one chip which is most probably connected to one IRQ line only.
But I don't think that eth0 has to be on the same interrupt as my SATA
controller. So, how do I make it go away to another place? I would be
fine sharing it with e.g. eth1, which is alone on IRQ 19.
BTW, the whole /proc/interrupts looks like this:
           CPU0
  0:   40022145    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:      62950    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:     681626    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:         55    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
 14:     968274    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:    1789182    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:     404489   IO-APIC-level  EMU10K1
 18:     445160   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3, eth0
 19:    1596427   IO-APIC-level  eth1
 20:          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
 21:          0   IO-APIC-level  NVidia nForce2
 22:      36730   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
NMI:          0
