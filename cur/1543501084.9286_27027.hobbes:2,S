You're right that any human short of a kernel developer isn't going to
do a perfect job keeping a bug&oops list. But anything which lightens
the load of the bug-fixer is going to help. The bug database isn't
really the hard part; the hard part is getting good quality oopses
and/or good quality test programs which show the problem.
Most of the people complaining about 2.2's stability right now don't
have outstanding oopses and bug reports, just a bunch of crashes. Odds
are most of the oopses and bugs have gotten dropped on the floor, or
never got sent in...
