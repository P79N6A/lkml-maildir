Hi.
Well, I investigated the previously reported issue
regarding a empty SFM when using fbcon a bit more.
What looks strange to me is that it seems that con_set_default_unimap
is never called when using fbcon.  Below patch fixes my problems,
after boot, I have a correctly defined sfm.  However, since
I am totally new to kernel hacking, I suspect it is not really
correct.  However, it is tested, and it works for me as expected.
