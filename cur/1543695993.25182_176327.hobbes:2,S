    Sounds like it needs an update.
Erm, I don't think so.  pci_map_single() covers a different use case
from pci_map_page().
The thing pci_map_single() can do that pci_map_page() can't is cope with
contiguous regions greater than PAGE_SIZE in length (which you get
either from kmalloc() or __get_free_pages()).  This feature is used in
the SCSI layer for instance.
There has been talk of deprecating dma_map_single() in favour of
dma_map_sg() (i.e. make all transfers use scatter/gather and eliminate
dma_map_single() in favour of a single sg entry table) but nothing has
been done about it (at least as far as I know).
