Hello, 
I am currently working on two device drivers for use in a laboratory
environment. One for a servo controller (TECH80 model 5650), the other one
for an AD convertor (CyrDAS 1800HR).
Question 1: how can a module retrieve the kernel boot options (e.g.
te5650=0x320) ? I couldn't find it in Beck's book "Linux kernel internals".
The other char drivers don't seem to bother very much about boot options.
Question 2: is there anyone with similar hardware who wants to test?
I am new to this mailinglist, so please forgive me if this is a trivial
question.
