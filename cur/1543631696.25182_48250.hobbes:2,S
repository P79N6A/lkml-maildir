Many people have said this before and I will say it again: Linux is
fine as an open-source/free-software rtos, but as a non-free rtos it
has no chance in front of the competition.
You can dimiss those who haven't chosen #4 as much as you want and
find all the reasons to justify your dismissal. It remains that the
embedded/rt market is closed to Linux because of the current situation.
