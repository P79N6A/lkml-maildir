How about a general "never probe" flag combined with a function to
connect an adapter to a client? High level drivers like DVB or BTTV
could then do something like:
	adapter = i2c_bit_add_bus(&my_card_ops);
	i2c_connect_client(adapter, &client_ops, address);
This problem comes up a lot, and i2c probing is only necessary for
finding motherboard sensors. For add-in cards and embedded systems the
driver developer normally knows exactly what is wired to what.
