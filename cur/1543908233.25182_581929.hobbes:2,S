More readable. (see '#ifdefs are ugly' in Documentation/SubmittingPatches)

Optimizer will remove that code if at91rm9200 support is not compiled and 
choose at runtime if the cpu support is compiled in.

Oops, I missed that problem, sorry...
and what about this:
#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_AT91RM9200
#define sdram_lowpower_enable() at91_sys_write(AT91_SDRAMC_SRR, 1)
#define sdram_lowpower_disable() at91_sys_write(AT91_SDRAMC_SRR, 0)
#else
#define sdram_lowpower_enable()
#define sdram_lowpower_disable()
#endif
and using sdram_lowpower_{enable,disable}() when requiered?

Marc
