i agree that we should do this in one go and in Linus' tree. I suspect 
David has a script for this, so we can do it anytime for any tree, 
right?
the amount of code that truly relies on regs being present is very low. 
Mostly only sysrq type of stuff and the timer interrupt is such. Any 
arch should be able to adopt to that promptly, but i'd favor a 
switchover that works on 99% of the arches, just to have this pain over 
instantly (sans small bugs).
