Because right now, YOUR PIECE OF CRAP IS BUGGY.
Look here, I'm not going to bother explain it to you any more. Do the 
	git grep '".*Linux version .*"'
thing, and if you don't understand why your CRAP IS BUGGY, I don't know 
what else I can tell you.
So I'll make it real simple: I hopefully fixed it this time, but the next 
time somebody happens to have a string that contains "Linux version" in 
it, I simply won't bother. It's not a kernel bug. It's a bug in your 
broken and utterly idiotic process. 
End of discussion.
