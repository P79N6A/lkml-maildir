Adding to my last email, I think the solution is to look at the 
implementation of pci_alloc_consistent and the other functions your 
patch calls.  You may be able to get away with simply changing your 
pci_alloc_consistent call to
dma_alloc_coherent(&hwdev->dev, size, dma_handle, GFP_DMA | GFP_KERNEL);
Take a look at include/asm-generic/pci-dma-compat.h for how 
pci_alloc_consistent is implemented on most platforms.
Thanks!
