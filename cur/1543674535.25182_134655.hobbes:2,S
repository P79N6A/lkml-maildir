Hiya Marc,
Thanks for the pointers to the new VM systems. I changed the kernel over to
2.4.21-rc2-ac2 (has rmap in it, right?) and I am rerunning my tests to see
if that solves the problem.
I agree with Andrea about bugs.. I certainly accept them as a necessary
evil. I tend to get frustrated when faced with something that I dont have
the skill to solve myself however. Especially so when I cant seem to get
pointed in the right direction by anyone. :)
Thanks again for your suggestion, and I will let you know if it works out!

I really don't know how often I've seen this in recent 2.4 kernels
(.17,.18,.19,.20 (mainstream) and so on).
For me, I use the rmap VM. The problem is eliminated in that tree. Also the
-aa VM does not have that problem.
I am pretty sure Andrea sent a fix for this issue more than once a while ago
to the list cc'ed Marcelo (correct me if I am wrong), but to quote Andrea:
"We are here to fix bugs. If bug fixes are not accepted we can stop right
here
to fix bugs".
ciao, Marc
