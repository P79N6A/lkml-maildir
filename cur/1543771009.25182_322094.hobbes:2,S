If RT is merged and RTAI not, that might be simpler to install, but I
wouldn't judje on what's simpler to use based on mainline inclusion or
not. I don't work in the emebdded-RT space, but if I had to build an
hard-RT embedded app for myself and I didn't need to run syscalls in
real time (i.e. no audio ioctls), I'd sure start with RTAI.

Sure agreed. But the main reliability problem that makes it only "ruby"
isn't the nanokernel itself, but the hardware too complex and linux
itself way too complex and not-provable, since it could hang and lock
the bus with a wrong dma operation on a graphics card or whatever else.
Perhaps those apps should run on OS stripped down w/o MMU and w/o irqs
and on much slower and more reliable cpus and ram. I'm not really an
expert of this area.
From a linux point of view, currently you can't get an harder stone than
RTAI/RTLinux/nanokernel (that's probably why I was biased and I called
it "diamond" hard, even if it was only "ruby" in absolute terms ;).

Possible. My only worry is that embedded people goes to metal level
thinking it's better than the ruby level, when they would be better and
simpler at the ruby level.
