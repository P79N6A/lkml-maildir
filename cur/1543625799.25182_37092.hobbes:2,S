Please, do we have to go on about the merits of Athlon XP systems in MP
configurations ?? 1) your wrong about the bridges, it only affects iirc
the new XP2000+ chips, 2) is it /REALLY/ the issue ?? i do not think so.
However, I am very happy to report that the system has just done it
again.  I can't give any further details yet, although i am just going
over to pay a visit to the box and do some more investigations.
FYI, we have two of these boxes with the same hardware / kernel
configuration.  Two of them have now shown the same problem (eth0
timeouts).  Including having maxcpus=1 set.
Could this perhaps be a driver issue after all ?
Many Thanks
Dave
