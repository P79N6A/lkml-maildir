This is a re-post
I found in 'fs/block_dev.c' there's a function  'check_disk_change' and 
        in 'fs/devfs/base.c' there's a function 'check_disc_changed'
They done exactly the same job. Their source code are quite the same.
I think that one of these must be rewritted to call/use the other and 
it's not to me to tell you which one :-).
