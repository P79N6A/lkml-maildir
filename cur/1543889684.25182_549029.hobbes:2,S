There is no way to specify additional CFLAGS on the commandline today.
For sparse we took the shorthand CF so you can do:
make C=2 CF=-warn-bitwise
But we have no such thing for CFLAGS.
If there is a real need I can cook up something.
But frankly I have alway edited top-level Makefile and be doen with it.
I will fix it so Kbuild do not barf out if you set EXTRA_* on the commandline
but silently ignore it instead.
