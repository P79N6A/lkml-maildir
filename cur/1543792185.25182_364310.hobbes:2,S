well despite your post; the Windows people are a lot better at keeping
old drivers working (win 9x to a NT based kernel was obviously a huge
change though). In linux you can use an old driver maybe for 6 months if
you're lucky.. in windows 6 years is no exception. So the problem is a
lot bigger in linux for the owner of such a card than it is in windows.
