Hi all.
This weekend i've solved my big printing trouble.
What i did? Well, i don't understand why, but i've just removed the devs
package, installed it again, removed the lp? devs, created them again with
mknod. Inacreditibily, works. Why? I really don't know. But now it working.
I don't touch my printcap, nor my printing subsystem. The only thing that
stop to work (from 2.2.0-final to 2.2.1) is the printer detection.
I will try this night with 2.2.2, to see what happens, and i will see the
printing subsystem diffs from the kernel versions, to find some tip in
printer detection.
Thanks all guys for tips and tricks.
