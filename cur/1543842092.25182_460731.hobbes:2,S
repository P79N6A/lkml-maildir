Subject: [RFC 2/5] dio: call blk_run_address_space() once per op
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

dio: call blk_run_address_space() once per op
We only need to call blk_run_address_space() once after all the bios for the
direct IO op have been submitted.  This removes the chance of calling
blk_run_address_space() after spurious wake ups as the sync path waits for bios
to drain.  It's also one less difference betwen the sync and async paths.
In the process we remove a redundant dio_bio_submit() that its caller had
already performed.
