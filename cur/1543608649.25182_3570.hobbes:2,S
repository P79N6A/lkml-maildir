Either too coarse or too fine, often enough, when we're talking about 
a semi-independent module. Consider, though, a more legitimate 
non-bloating use of a version field. Rather than try to support all 
versions, use it to determine whether the two ends of the 
communication channel are compatible, and fail gracefully because of 
the incompatible version. Tell the user to update the app, or 
whatever.
