Subject: [RFC] [PATCH] madvise() does not always return -EBADF on non-file mapped area
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

hi,
madvise() system call returns -EBADF for areas which does not map to 
files, only for *behaviour* request MADV_WILLNEED.
Is it the intended behaviour of madvise() ?
According to man pages, madvise returns :
EBADF - the map exists, but the area maps something that isn’t a file.
I have attached a patch which could resolve the issue.

Patch to fix madvise() to return -EBADF for non-file mapped area on any 
requested behaviour.
