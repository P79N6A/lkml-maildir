But you already have reasonably realistic test code right?
We were burned a few times recently with new interfaces that turned
out to be not really usable from the user perspective.
Ideal situation to avoid that would be that at least one person other than 
the patch submitter has successfully written a program using it first.
e.g. I'm still feeling a bit uneasy about that global sysctl
embedded in the interface.

application debuggers and possible performance tools. There are certainly
a lot of possibilities from this.

I think some others do. But the details are always CPU specific. I doubt
much low level code will be possible to share. But it would be good
if the ptrace interface is generic enough for everybody (I think it was
though)

Agreed.
