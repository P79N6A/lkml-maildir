Oh beautiful. This is wonderful. I've been hoping for a chance to test the MCE
code. Ok you might not agree 8)
Right there is missing \n I'll go fix but the rest of it says
b2	-	register valid, uncorrected error, error enabled
0008	-	model specific data
0a01	-	memory access,
		generic error
		l1 cache
		processor responding to request
So there we are - a real live CPU error
