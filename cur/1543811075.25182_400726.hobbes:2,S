We don't mess around with i_sem during read. So that piece of locking 
code is ok (but I have to say it looks very messy). The thing we can't 
work around is #518 in get_more_blocks() (from 2.6.9 base code so line 
offset may be different but you can get the idea):
    491 static int get_more_blocks(struct dio *dio)
    492 {
    493         int ret;
    ......
    516
    517                 create = dio->rw == WRITE;
    518                 if ((dio->lock_type == DIO_LOCKING) || 
(dio->lock_type =        = DIO_CLUSTER_LOCKING)) {
    519                         if (dio->block_in_file < 
(i_size_read(dio->inode        ) >>
    520                                                         
dio->blkbits))
    521                                 create = 0;
    522                 } else if (dio->lock_type == DIO_NO_LOCKING) {
    523                         create = 0;
    524                 }

That's a good news - these DIO locking flags are all last-minute 
bandaids anyway.

On the road all next week but will get to it when I'm back to office. On 
the other hand, thank you for looking into this.
