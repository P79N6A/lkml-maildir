Thanks.
AS should be OK with SMP, but it would be nice to see
how it goes with a large number of spindles and processors.
AS should also be able to run SCSI alright, it tends to
perform quite poorly with TCQ and multiple random readers
though unfortunately. I'm setting up a box here with an
IDE and SCSI disk which I'll run my regression tests on,
(previously only IDE) so I might be able to help this along
a bit.
Fairness and interactiveness with AS and big TCQ should
be quite a bit better than deadline though, so it would
be a good workstation option even if it can't keep database
throughput up.
It looks like database loads without TCQ are often better
with AS than deadline, your AIM7 is, WimMark is. They can
be worse though. pgbench for example.

Don't ask me what the deal is here ;)
AS would have no impact on a single threaded IO load. aa is
using a lot of CPU for some reason. Driver difference
maybe? readahead? Andrea's secret sauce?
aa also gets much worse latency spikes at higher thread
counts (if tiobench is to be believed!). As thread count
rises readahead can't fit into the request queue, and you
see AS working.
On the write side, current mms should be improved due to
some changes in request allocation.
