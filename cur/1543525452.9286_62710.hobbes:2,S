   I've just been reviewing the changes to 3c59x.c, and have noticed
   the following line of code:
	   vp->rx_ring = (void *)(((long)vp->priv_addr + 15) & ~15);
   Can someone explain the purpose of this please?
The rx ring needs to be 16-byte aligned, so 15 bytes of slop are
added the to allocation size and it is aligned here.
Whats hard to understand about what it is doing?  Admittedly it
is a bit ugly, but other than that it is correct.
In fact there is a comment right above that statement describing
what it is doing!
Later,
