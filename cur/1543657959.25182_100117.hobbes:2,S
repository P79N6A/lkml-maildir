No, you cannot use mmap() to open files ... :-),
at most mmap() helps caching static file contents in order
to avoid too many open() / close() calls (which maybe slow).
Apache 2 seems to use sendfile (in blocking mode) by default,
it uses mmap() only if you enable it (see also mod_file_cache).
Other web servers (i.e. Zeus) use widely mmap() for specific
file sizes, when it is usually a strong win (specially under *BSD and
Solaris)
in big / busy servers with lots of RAM.

Certainly yes (after required bug fixes :-)
