Hi kernelhackers!
AGP did not work on my system with my SiS 746 chipset.
I applied this patch: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/2/22/102
by Oliver Schoett manually against 2.6.4-rc1 and then AGP
worked. More info about my system can be found here:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40891
I did not find a bug for this on buzilla.kernel.org, should I
file one?
Please CC me in an answer.
Thanks you all for your great work!
