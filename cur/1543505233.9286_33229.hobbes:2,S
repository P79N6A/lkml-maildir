Subject: [RFC] New modutils maintainer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a resend.  Some people got the original mail but not everybody,
the original has not appeared on at least 3 of the l-k archives.  Very
strange.
Modutils development seems to have stopped (see history below).  I
hereby volunteer to become the modutils maintainer.
If anybody objects to this or wishes to become the modutils maintainer
themselves, please contact <kaos@ocs.com.au> before August 15.
Otherwise I will designate myself as the modutils maintainer and start
publishing patches on August 16.
Please do not send me any modutils patches until August 16.
History.
  Modutils development passed from Richard Henderson to Bjorn Ekwall in
  early March, 1999.  Patches were issued on
  
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/
 up to March 25 but nothing since.
  I have patches to include in modutils to assist ksymoops (which I
  maintain).  Several mails to Bjorn since April 8 got no response.
  On July 19, I mailed every name that appeared in modutils source and
  man pages.  I asked if they were going to maintain modutils and
  offered my time if not, with a date of July 26 for me to send this
  announcement to l-k.  Nobody objected, a couple of people encouraged
  me.
  On July 26, Bjorn Ekwall responded saying he had been too busy and
  "It might be a good idea to plan for a transfer of responsibility,
  although I really should put the final touches on the current version
  before that".  I have received nothing from Bjorn since that first
  mail on July 26, despite reminder emails on August 2, 4 and 6.
  Changes have been made to the modutils CVS tree which do not appear
  on the web pages.
  Given the imminent code freeze for 2.4, I want to get modutils up to
  date.  Hence this RFC.
