I ran into this as well, since the 2.5.69-70 config entry is *really*
unclear on what you need to enter there, it's not in the standard
Y/N/M format for options.  For example:
    Kernel module loader (KMOD) [Y/n/?] y
  *
  * Processor type and features
  *
  Subarchitecture Type (PC-compatible, Voyager (NCR), NUMAQ (IBM/Sequent), Summit/EXA (IBM x440), Support for other sub-arch SMP systems with more than 8 CPUs, SGI 320/540 (Visual Workstation), Generic architecture (Summit, bigsmp, default)) [PC-compatible] (NEW) 
What the hell am I supposed to enter here?  This is just friggin ugly
and un-readable.  It should be cleaned up.  Or is it just that the
help entry is appended to the question improperly here?  That's sorta
what it looks like peering at it with my head turned to the left all
the way.
Are these choices all mutually exclusive?  Or can you build a kernel
which will run on all these machines?  Now that would be interesting
for a distro to have... not.  *grin*
