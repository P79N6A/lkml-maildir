Actually it should go away before 2.6.0.  sys_futex never was part of a
released stable kernel so having the old_ version around is silly.  I
Think it's enough time until 2.6 hits the roads for people to have those
vendor libc flushed out that use it.  (and sys_futex still isn't used
in the glibc CVS, only in the addon nptl package with pre-1 release
numbers.)
