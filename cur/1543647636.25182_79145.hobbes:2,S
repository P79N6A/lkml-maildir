Hi Ingo,
the following compile error in stallion.c seems to be a result of your
Workqueue Abstraction patch:
<--  snip  -->
...
  gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/char/.stallion.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
-march=k6 -Iarch/i386/mach-generic -nostdinc -iwithprefix include
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=stallion   -c -o drivers/char/stallion.o
drivers/char/stallion.c
...
drivers/char/stallion.c: In function `stl_initports':
drivers/char/stallion.c:2294: structure has no member named `routine'
...
make[2]: *** [drivers/char/stallion.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Could you provide a fix for this?
TIA
Adrian
