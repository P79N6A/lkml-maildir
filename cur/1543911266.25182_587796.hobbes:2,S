Yes I did, sorry.  Do you have a pointer for it, all I see is these
patches in -mm:
	console-keyboard-events-and-accessibility.patch
	console-keyboard-events-and-accessibility-fix.patch
	console-keyboard-events-and-accessibility-fix-2.patch

Yes.  Also, things like "register_keyboard_notifier" should be
"keyboard_register_notifer", trying to keep everything in the
"keyboard*" namespace to make things a bit easier overall[1].

As we can do this today with the console layer (think boot consoles over
serial and network and even USB), it should not be that tough.  Just be
an early console yourself also.

Does speakup need to handle it?  I know it's the most popular reader
package out there, but other people seem to have other screen readers
too, but I am in no position to evaluate if their hacks/patches are
really something that is needed here.
Also, we really would like to see the users of these hooks (meaning the
speakup drivers) go into the tree at the same time the hooks do, as we
don't like hooks with no users in the kernel.
I know the speakup code needs a lot of work to bring it up to
kernel-acceptance level.  Has this work been done, or is it happening?
If you need help in this area, I can see about doing a bit as I did a
lot of cleanup of this codebase a few years ago.  I also know of a few
users who are willing to help test this stuff out.
Anyway, thanks a lot for working to get this code into the main tree,
it's very useful to an important group of users.
thanks,
greg k-h
