2.2.7 and below had a permanent 5second delay. This is worse behaviour
than the 1 second delay.

With your test I see both the 30second delay (if you don't access the
parent directory in any way) and the 1 second delay. No persistent
negative dentries.
If this is a major problem, I suggest rather that we fine-tune the
delays, not that we remove support for negative dentry caching. Linus'
typical example was an NFS-shared /usr/share partition (or any NFSroot
system): if you have several users searching for a file in such a
tree, turning off caching of negative dentries can lead to storms of
unnecessary NFS_LOOKUP calls.
