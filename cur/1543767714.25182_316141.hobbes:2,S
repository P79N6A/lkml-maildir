That seems to be the basic idea but there doesn't seem to be a provider
stack just yet, just a 'client' (though I could be wrong).  AOE is
similar in concept to iSCSI with the biggest difference being that AOE
runs over Ethernet and is thus non-routeable.  iSCSI operates over IP so
you can do all kinds of fun IP games with it.
