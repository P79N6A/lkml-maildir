Well I would hope that _if_ we decide to switch schedulers, then you
get a chance to field something (and I hope you will decide to and have
time to), and I hope we don't rush into the decision.
We've had the current scheduler for so many years now that it is much
more important to make sure we take the time to do the right thing
rather than absolutely have to merge a new scheduler right now ;)
