Hi all
I apologize if this is question doesn't belong here, but I haven't found
any answers anywhere I've been looking.
What I want to do...
dd if=/dev/hda of=/some/file/on/another/larger/drive
mk_block_dev /some/file/on/another/larger/drive
cat /proc/partitions
[here the partitions on the (latter) /dev/hda will show up
and - after this - mount the partitions.
Thanks all
roy
