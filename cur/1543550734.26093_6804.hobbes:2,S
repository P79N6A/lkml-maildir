David,
majordomo@vger.kernel.org is not answering the "lists" test with a
reply.  The server shows to be up at 199.183.24.194, and nslookup
reports:
[root@vger /]#
[root@vger /]# nslookup -querytype=mx vger.kernel.org
Server:  slkcpop1.slkc.uswest.net
Address:  206.81.128.1
Non-authoritative answer:
vger.kernel.org preference = 200, mail exchanger = zeus.kernel.org
vger.kernel.org preference = 10, mail exchanger = vger.kernel.org
Authoritative answers can be found from:
kernel.org      nameserver = ns1.kernel.org
kernel.org      nameserver = ns2.kernel.org
kernel.org      nameserver = ns1.transmeta.com
kernel.org      nameserver = ns2.transmeta.com
zeus.kernel.org internet address = 209.10.41.242
vger.kernel.org internet address = 199.183.24.194
ns1.kernel.org  internet address = 209.10.217.83
ns2.kernel.org  internet address = 209.10.41.242
ns1.transmeta.com       internet address = 209.10.41.227
ns2.transmeta.com       internet address = 209.10.217.68
[root@vger /]#
but majordomo appears to be hosed or something.  I'll forward this to
the list.  It's not on this end -- I can send email everywhere else and
the law firm downstairs just got in and sent tons of legal briefs all
over the place (San Francisco, London, etc.).  You might want to go
check and see if majordomo is hung or something on an address without a
valid reverse DNS or something.
Thanks David,
Jeff
P.S.  We got anaconda running now and figured out thanks to the guy you
referred us to.  Thanks.
:-)
