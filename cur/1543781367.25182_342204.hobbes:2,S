Please, Roman, I'm spending quite a bit of time breaking this up into
small chunks specifically to help this discussion. Rather then just
stating that the logic is changed in small ways, could you please be
specific and point to where that logic has changed and we can fix or
discuss it.

Ok, one down, 12 to go ;)

Eh? The adjtimex() interface causes a small adjustment to be added or
removed from the system time each tick. Why should this code not be put
behind a clear interface?

Again, I'm not understanding your objection. Its exactly because the
time_adjust and phase values are NTP specific variables that I'm trying
to move them from the timer.c code into ntp.c
I'm trying to address your concerns, I just need you to be more
explicit.
thanks
