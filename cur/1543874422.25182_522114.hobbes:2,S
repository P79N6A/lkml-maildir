I was not actually so much speaking about Con, as about a lot of the 
tone in general here. And yes, it's not been entirely black and white. I 
was very happy to see the "try this patch" email from Al Boldi - not 
because I think that patch per se was necessarily the right fix (I have no 
idea), but simply because I think that's the kind of mindset we need to 
have.
Not a lot of people really *like* the old scheduler, but it's been tweaked 
over the years to try to avoid some nasty behaviour. I'm really hoping 
that RSDL would be a lot better (and by all accounts it has the potential 
for that), but I think it's totally naïve to expect that it won't need 
some tweaking too.
So I'll happily still merge RSDL right after 2.6.21 (and it won't even be 
a config option - if we want to make it good, we need to make sure 
*everybody* tests it), but what I want to see is that "can do" spirit wrt 
tweaking for issues that come up.
Because let's face it - nothing is ever perfect. Even a really nice 
conceptual idea always ends up hitting the "but in real life, things are 
ugly and complex, and we've depended on behaviour X in the past and can't 
change it, so we need some tweaking for problem Y".
And everything is totally fixable - at least as long as people are willing 
to!
