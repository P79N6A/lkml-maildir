I'd love to see a filesystem feature where I could efficiently identify
"changed files", where "changed" is defined by last time this application
checked or something similar.  A bonus would be to propagate this up
directory trees.  Yes I know about hard links, and it's not necessary to
propagate up trees in those cases.  (The application can just remember
paths of directories containing hard links, and not depend on the
per-directory bits for those paths).
There are ways to do it but not much enthusiasm last time I brought it
up.
