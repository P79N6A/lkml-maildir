Umm.. as a wild guess? Maybe a patch to add entries to the sysctl_check_table
arrays for your sysctl?
They didn't spend their holiday just coming up with this to annoy you - the
checking found a *lot* of entries that were well and truly broken (in the
how-did-it-ever-not-panic sense)...
Yes, it does make it more difficult for out-of-tree modules to create a new
sysctl entry - which is probably just as well, given that there's sysfs and
debugfs and a whole lot of other options as well for userspace-kernel
interaction.
