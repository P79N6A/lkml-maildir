Okay, thought I'd stare at this thing a bit -- there's no specific 1888 
documentation available it seems but I did notice something in the 1878 
datasheet which might mean something. The docs says that bits 0-1 are don't 
care for DMA but don't for IRQ, so could it possibly be as simple as the 
attached?
1878 sheet doesn't document register 0x7f, it seems...
Assuming it's not just this, this thing is going to require quite a bit of 
trial and error and without the hardware this will be troublesome. I expect 
this is not it, since the arch init code also doesn't care about bit 0 when 
setting that same register for IRQ 5.
If this is not it -- I'd try s/0x50/0x10/ in that line, even completely 
commenting out the IRQ setting line (with the arch code built in) and just 
generally frolic around 'till something blows up...
Rene.
