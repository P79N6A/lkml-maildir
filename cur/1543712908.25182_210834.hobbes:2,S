Uhm, depends on the CPUs you think of. I bet much more than half of
the Opterons and Itanium2 CPUs sold last year went into HPC. Certainly
not so many IA64s went into NUMA machines. But almost all Opterons ;-)
IBM's NUMA machines with Power CPUs are mainly sold with AIX into the
HPC market, I don't recall to have seen big HPC installations with HP
Superdome under Linux, not yet...? IBM sells x86-NUMA more into the
commercial market, the only big visible Linux-NUMA in HPC is SGI's
Altix. Most of the other NUMA machines go into HPC with other OSes and
we don't care about them (yet?). So you're probably right about the
number of Linux-NUMA-HPC users, but this actually shows that
Linux-NUMA is currently not the ideal choice. We're working on it,
right?

Yes! A per process flag would be enough to have the choice.

Sure. On the other hand the benchmark brought into discussion by Andi
is very easy to understand, much easier than any Java monster. If the
scheduler doesn't have a screw for running this optimally, it's
disappointing.

My current impression is: YES. My testing experience with it is
still very limited...
