Setting a memory policy is different from migrating pages of an 
application. The migration function migrates a process, it does not set 
any memory policies. Cpuset may change memory policies of the tasks 
contained in it but sys_migrate_pages() cannot.
We need a similar hook for the sys_move_pages() function call in mm right?
If this is a generic hook then I would suggest to have some hook that 
contains the term "memory placement" somewhere that would fit both system 
calls.
