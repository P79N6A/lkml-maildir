Does your database *require* a filesystem ?   At least Oracle can do without,
but I don't know about others...
Usually, if you want performance, you let the database use the block device
without putting a filesystem on top of it.
You probably don't want a 130G ext2 if there is any chance that a power
surge etc. can cause the machine to reboot without umount()'ing the 
filesystem.  A fsck on a 130G filesystem is going to take a *long* time.
