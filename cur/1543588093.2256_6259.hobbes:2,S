I think these events have a generic utility not specific to UIs. In
particular, when ones battery is running out, one would quite like the
event manager to be notified. As is currently the case with e.g. apmd.
Polling on battery charge left or battery voltage/current is different
from this, surely? Why should such programs have to be notified that
the battery was low? The event itself is pretty useless if you're
doing polling but there is no point throwing it away, in case you
aren't.
