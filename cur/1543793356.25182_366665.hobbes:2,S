I don't think suspend to ram for a memory hotplug remove would be acceptable to 
users.  The other methods add some complexity to the kernel, but are transparent 
to userspace.  Downtime of 5 to 10 seconds is really quite a bit of downtime.

It would still require a remappable kernel.  And seems intuitively to be wrong 
to me.  But if you want to try it out I won't stop you.  It might even work.
