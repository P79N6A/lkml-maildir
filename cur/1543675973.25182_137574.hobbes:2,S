Subject: [patch] 2.4.21rc6-ac1: fix pc300_drv.c .text.exit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Trying to compile pc300_drv.c statically into a kernel without hotplug 
support results in a .text.exit error at final linking.
The problem is that the pointer to the __devexit cpc_remove_one didn't 
use __devexit_p.
The patch below fixes this issue, besides it does a few small cleanups 
to the struct.
Please apply
