For the pleasure of comparing CPU schedulers, both CFS v16 & full CK2 patched pre-built kernels for Fedora 7 using latest build 3194 are now available at 
http://linux-dev.qc.ec.gc.ca
There is also a not yet fully tuned YUM repository configuration file available at 
http://linux-dev.qc.ec.gc.ca/kernel/fedora/alt-sched.repo
Although I suggest you download the rpm's directly from the web page & install both manually using rpm -ivh --force
Have fun.
