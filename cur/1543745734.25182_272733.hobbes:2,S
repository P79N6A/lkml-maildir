Well. I tried to use kdump.
I think documentation needs update. Documentation says
..
4) Load the second kernel to be booted using
   kexec -p <second-kernel> --args-linux --append="root=<root-dev> dump
   init 1 memmap=exactmap memmap=640k@0 memmap=32M@16M"
But kexec doesn't seem to like option "-p".
Even when I removed "-p", its complaining about "--args-linux"
# ./kexec  --args-linux --append="root=/dev/sda2 dump init 1
memmap=exactmap memmap=640k@0 memmap=32M@16M"  /boot/kexec2
./kexec: unrecognized option `--args-linux'
kexec 1.98 released 15 September 2004
Usage: kexec [OPTION]... [kernel]
Directly reboot into a new kernel
 -h, --help        Print this help.
 -v, --version     Print the version of kexec.
 -f, --force       Force an immediate kexec, don't call shutdown.
 -x, --no-ifdown   Don't bring down network interfaces.
                   (if used, must be last option specified)
 -l, --load        Load the new kernel into the current kernel.
 -u, --unload      Unload the current kexec target kernel.
 -e, --exec        Execute a currently loaded kernel.
 -t, --type=TYPE   Specify the new kernel is of this type.
Supported kernel file types and options:
elf32-x86
    --command-line=STRING Set the kernel command line to STRING
    --append=STRING       Set the kernel command line to STRING
    --initrd=FILE         Use FILE as the kernel's initial ramdisk.
    --ramdisk=FILE        Use FILE as the kernel's initial ramdisk.
    --args-linux          Pass linux kernel style options
    --args-elf            Pass elf boot notes
bzImage
-d, --debug               Enable debugging to help spot a failure.
    --real-mode           Use the kernels real mode entry point.
    --command-line=STRING Set the kernel command line to STRING.
    --append=STRING       Set the kernel command line to STRING.
    --initrd=FILE         Use FILE as the kernel's initial ramdisk.
    --ramdisk=FILE        Use FILE as the kernel's initial ramdisk.
Cannot load /boot/kexec2
