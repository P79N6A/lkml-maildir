hm, commit 4507a6a59cfc6997e532cd812a8bd244181e6205 does not exist:
  fatal: bad object 4507a6a59cfc6997e532cd812a8bd244181e6205
but i suspect it must be something along the lines of the known problem 
of really old gcc versions creating huge stackframes? Those pristine gcc 
versions were practically unusable for distro kernels anyway (and were 
patched by distros) - but i have no problem with restricting this 
feature to gcc4x. gcc4x creates more compact -Os code too, so it's 
recommended for smaller image sizes.

good point, fixed that.

yeah, instead of littering our include files with those quirks.
