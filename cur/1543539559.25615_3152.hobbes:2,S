When why should it not be fixed?
School is in session at T13.
There are two sides in that world.
DRIVE v/s HOST.
THe Linux driver is part of the HOST
Doing what I showed could be done is considered a "dumb host".
The drive makers will not honor a warrenty because a "dumb host" destroyed
the drive.
Finally, It can be done to SCSI too, but I have no solution for it.
