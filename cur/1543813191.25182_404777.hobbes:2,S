I think you are talking past each other, and are both right - Con is
saying games don't need realtime scheduling (SCHED_FIFO, low nice value,
whatever) to function correctly (true), while Zan is saying that games
have RT constraints in that they must react as fast as possible to user
input (also true).
Anyway, this is getting OT, I wish I had not raised this issue in this
thread.
