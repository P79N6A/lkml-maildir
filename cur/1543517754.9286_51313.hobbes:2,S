Hi
I wac copying some binary image of a floppy on my 1.44 floppy
and typed "exit" at another console.
The exit didn't execute until the floppy was filled, after which the normal
login prompt appeared.
During the copying, entering username on another console worked.
What is this? A feature of kernel?
