Worried.  This places an ordering interpretation on TASK_* and EXIT_* which
AFAIK hadn't been there beforehand.  If someone later comes along and adds
#define TASK_DOODLING 64
then we lose.
I wonder if for clarity and future-safety we should do something like:

It seems a bit dorky for some reason...
