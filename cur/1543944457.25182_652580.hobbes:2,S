I agree with this and that is exactly what I screwed up by mistake
this time around.
Normally when I rebase I walk through the patches that came from other
people's trees and add signoffs as needed.  I understand that this
is frowned upon to some extent as well.

I actually wouldn't mind that, the first thing I do when sending a
pull request is I stop putting things into my tree and as soon as the
recipient pulls I wipe out my tree and clone a fresh copy of their's.
It's really not a big deal.  The pusher can queue patches and other
stuff up in their mailbox or in a directory somewhere.  This quiet
period also allows those patches to have some time to be reviewed on
the lists before they actually end up in anyone's tree.
I really like that mode of operation.
