if you are interested in this I would strongly urge you to read Curt
Schimmel's book (UNIX(R) Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric
Multiprocessing and Caching for Kernel Programmers); it explains this
and related materials really really well.

the cache flushing is a per architecture property. On x86, the cache
flushing isn't needed; but a TLB flush is. Depending on your hardware
that can be expensive as well.
