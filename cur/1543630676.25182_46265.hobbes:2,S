->a network w/other devices
IB fabric does not replace the network. It is designed for the data-center.
IB offers even more RAS from a server standpoint. For e.g todays drivers
could DMA to areas of memory owned by another driver/process. IB protects
your RDMA by implementing protection domains which each driver could be on a
separate protection domain, and any access to RDMA to areas not owned would
only cause error to the specific driver/application that is malfunctioning.
->    - qos control
IB specifies Service Level (a.k.a SL) and multiple data Virtual Lanes (VL)
that can be managed via the Subnet Manager to implement QoS. There is a
dedicated workgroup in IBTA working on some of these issues.
Applications that would require absolute feel of the metal can use the
access layer API's that will provide direct user mode ability to send data
from hardware, and also process completions without entering kernel mode
entirely in user mode, if the hardware permits that.
