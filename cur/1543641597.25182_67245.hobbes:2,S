   I do wan't to tune the vm settings, these warnings may not be 
fatal but it's not pretty to have hundreds of those in the console 
and log files. Bear with me on this one, but i remember doing exactly 
that in the past, tuning  /proc/sys/vm/freepages. How does one 
acomplish that nowadays? I looked at the kernel source documentation 
and still found references to freepages, but vm/freepages doesn't 
exist anymore. Kernel is 2.4.18-10 from Redhat. 
Regards,
Pedro
