It is much deeper than that. The recent hack to kill requests is yet
another example of that. At least this work-around makes it a little
better, but the mid layer assumption that sdev going to zero implies the
queue going away at the same time is inherently broken.

That's essentially what the work-around does.

I rather like the queue lock being a pointer, so you can share at
whatever level you want. Lets not grow the request_queue a full lock
just to work around a bug elsewhere.
