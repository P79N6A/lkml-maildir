Hi.
I have just installed a system with kernel 2.4.20, and it stops booting
with a message like:
	Controller is in an impossible state. Disable UDMA.
Board is a SuperMicro 370DLE (SW LE chipset). I have tried disabling 
ide channels on the bios, but kernel still sees them. I have tried to
boot with ide0=nodma (is this options real, or I just have invented it ??)
No solution.
Any ideas ?
TIA
