Thanks, I needed that! :)

Ok, you are kernel and Gentoo developer - you are right by definition. :)

Because in short time we will end with / occupying >1 page of console - 
and it will be bad in my opinion. Besides do we really need that many 
fses - each for exporting kernel data to userspace? This is at least 
strange. Why can not /dev, /selinux be merged into /sys (ok, maybe there 
should be symlinks in /dev to devices in right device directory in /sys). 
Why debugfs can not live in /sys - for example in /sys/debug? What is 
wrong with one value per file and debugfs?
And I have also other question: Where can I find some info about using 
/sys (in kernel) and some small note about its implementation and overhead 
(cpu and memory)?
Thanks,
