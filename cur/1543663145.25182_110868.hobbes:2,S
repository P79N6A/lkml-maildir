On my copy of Shawn's dmesg I see the following:
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: Using PIC for interrupt routing
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (00:00)
PCI: Probing PCI hardware (bus 00)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0._PRT]
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [PIN1] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 *10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [PIN2] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 *9 10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [PIN3] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 14 15, disabled)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [PIN4] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 *11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [PIN3] enabled at IRQ 5

Agreed, in this particular case there are no available irqs for PnPISA to
assign because it isn't able to share irqs.  Here is some aditional
information about the ISAPnP device that is using irq 5.
7 is used by the parport
10 and 11 are used by pci devices
5 is clear but only with pci=noacpi

How would you suggest PnP and PCI coordinate this?
Thanks,
