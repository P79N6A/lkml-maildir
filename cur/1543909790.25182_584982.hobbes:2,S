Al Viro added to the CC, since he's one of the experts on this stuff  
and will probably whack me with a LART for explaining it all wrong,  
or something. :-D

Doing it in the kernel won't make it any faster.

You can't safely preserve POSIX semantics that way.  For example,  
even without *ANY* ability to read /etc/shadow, I can easily "ln /etc/ 
shadow /tmp/shadow", assuming they are on the same filesystem.  If  
the /etc/shadow permissions depend on inherited ACLs to enforce  
access then that one little command just made your shadow file world- 
readable/writeable.  Oops.
Think about it this way:
Permissions depend on *what* something is, not *where* it is.  Under  
Linux you can leave the digital equivalent of a $10,000 piece of  
jewelry lying around in /var/www and not have to worry about it being  
compromised as long as you set your permissions properly (not that I  
recommend it).  Moving the piece of jewelry around your house does  
not change what it *is* (and by extension does not change the  
protection required on it), any more than "ln /etc/shadow /tmp/ 
shadow" (or "mv") changes what *it* is.  If your /house is really  
extraordinarily secure then you could leave the jewelry lying around  
as /house/gems.bin with permissions 0777, but if somebody had a back- 
door to /house (an open fd, a careless typo, etc) then you'd have the  
same issues.

Not necessarily.  When I do "vim some-file-in-current-directory", for  
example, the kernel does *NOT* look up the path of my current  
directory.  It does (in pseudocode):
if (starts_with_slash(filename)) {
	entry = task->cwd;
} else {
	entry = task->root;
}
while (have_components_left(filename)
	entry = lookup_next_component(filename);
return entry;
That's not even paying attention to functions like "fchdir" or their  
interactions with "chroot" and namespaces.  I can probably have an  
open directory handle to a volume in a completely different  
namespace, a volume which isn't even *MOUNTED* in my current fs  
namespace.  Using that file-handle I believe I can "fchdir",  
"openat", etc, in a completely different namespace.  I can do the  
same thing with a chroot, except there I can even "escape":
   /* Switch into chroot.  Doesn't drop root privs */
   chdir("/some/dir/somewhere");
   chroot(".");
   /* Malicious code later on */
   chdir("/");
   chroot("another_dir");
   chdir("../../../../../../../../..");
   chroot(".");
   /* Now I'm back in the real root filesystem */

The locking penalty is because the path-lookup is *not* implied.  The  
above chroot example shows that in detail.  If you have to do the  
lookup in *reverse* on every open operation then you have to either:
   (A) Store lots of security context with every open directory (cwd  
included).  When a directory you have open is moved, you still have  
full access to everything inside it since your handle's data hasn't  
changed.
OR
   (B) Do a reverse-lookup on every operation, which means you are  
taking locks in the reverse order from the normal lookup order and  
you're either very inefficient and slow or you're deadlocky.  This is  
also vulnerable to confusion when the "path" isn't visible from your  
namespace/chroot at all.  This also causes problems with overmounted  
directories:
	root@ares:/# mkdir -p /foo/bar
	root@ares:/# cd /foo/bar
	root@ares:/foo/bar# mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /foo
	root@ares:/foo/bar# touch /foo/bar/baz
	touch: cannot touch `/foo/bar/baz': No such file or directory
	root@ares:/foo/bar# pwd
	/foo/bar
	root@ares:/foo/bar# ls -al
	total 4
	drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 2007-08-15 17:04 .
	drwxrwxrwt 2 root root   40 2007-08-15 17:04 ..

See above.  Linux has a very *very* powerful VFS nowadays.  It also  
has support for shared subtrees across private namespaces, allowing  
things like polyinstantiation.  For example you can configure a Linux  
box so every user gets their own empty /tmp directory created and  
mounted on their namespace's /tmp when they log in, but all the rest  
of the system mounts are all shared.
I'll be offline for a couple days, we can chat more when I get back.
