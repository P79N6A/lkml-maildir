Nope. The new text-based mount code should just work. There should be no
need to also support cachefs via the legacy binary formant.

This needs to be split up.
Scheduling an fscache write, retrieving pages from fscache, managing
fscache cache consistency, adding statistics are all examples of
completely separate tasks that should not be bunched together in a
single megapatch, particularly not since they touch core NFS code.
