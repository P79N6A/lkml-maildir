This is a new server that I've been having trouble getting stable for the past week -- this is the first Oops I've managed to capture.  It's a 2.6.2-rc3 kernel compiled/running on Fedora Core 1 on a P4.  (I've not tried an -mm kernel yet, I'll try that soon.  I'm also thinking the stock gcc 3.3.2 may be problematic...?)

As you can see in the attached .config, HIGHMEM is no longer enabled (and was not when this crash occured).  Running memtest86 for several hours did not turn up any memory errors.

I heard that the PREEMPT is causing problems, earlier, try without
CONFIG_PREEMPT
Could you please describe what the server is serving (router or
something else?)
I had that kind of problem with my router back in 2.6.0-test, I don't
know if it's fixed yet.
