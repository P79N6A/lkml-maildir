No, it's a 2.5 thing: modules know their own name.  This is because
(1) the names are used to set new-style boot parameters, (2) needing
to insert two modules is usually wrong, since how would that work if
the module was built-in?
It also opens us up to the possibility of a list of built-in modules,
if we wanted to.
However, the -o option to modprobe replaces the module name (by
hacking the elf object, yes), because programmers are basically lazy,
and multiple modules are useful for testing.
So, you want:
	for i in `seq 1 100`; do modprobe -o dummy$i dummy; done
This works on 2.4 as well.  Note that insmod doesn't support -o, being
a trivial program by design.
> It seems like not supporting this is likely to cause some problems.
Yes.  Removing any feature causes problems 8(.  But adding every
feature is usually worse.
Hope this clarifies?
Rusty.
