I have made it work with DMA mode 2 multi-word succesfully, but that is a
low as we go.  It, PDC20262, appears to be a super set of the PDC20246
with a few extra strings attached.  Tests for bit 13 of id->word93
for the correct cable is a udma_66 test bit for the driver.
Since speed settings for 8 and 7 are unknown and 6->0 appear to mirror
the Ultra33, dynamic tuning for UDMA 3/4 are not performed yet.
It also appears that the set_geometry is cranky but not fatal.
This will be in "2.2.6.uniform-ide-6.19.patch.gz" to appear soon.
FYI that 80c to 40pin ribbon is a stiff witch.
The nice thing is that Promise got smart and reversed physical locations
of ide1/ide2.
front		card		back
ide1		Ultra33		ide2
ide2		Ultra66		ide1
Also hd. led header is at right angles and not vertical.
When you find an ATA-66 drive send me a copy of the pci-config and the
drive number.
