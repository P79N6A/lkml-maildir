I'd strongly suggest that you post this same question on the 
linuxppc-dev lists, if you haven't already.  My experience with Linux on 
PPC based machines has shown those lists to offer much more support than 
the standard development list here for that platform.
Take a look a lists.linuxppc.org and see if they can help you out.
Later,
Tom
