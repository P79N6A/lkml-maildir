I assume this is the case if the ioapic is also in virtual wire mode and the
destination field for the appropriate interrupt(s) (the timer interrupt in this
case) is set to either physical mode with a destination id of the lapic for the
running cpu, or if it is set to logical mode and the destination id has the
corresponding bit for the running cpu set.  Is that right?

I thought we only had one ioapic in this system (Ben correct me if I'm wrong on
that please).  I thought the above printk told us that, because apic2 and pin2
are both -1, that means that the 8259 isn't physically connected to any cpu, and
instead is routed through apic 0, and asserts on pin 2 of that ioapic.

If that were the case, then we would need to support moving kexec boot to cpu0,
at least in some limited cases.  I've got a patch together that enables the
handshaking I was brainstorming earlier, which should allow an attempted jump to
cpu0 on a crash, with a fallback to booting on the crashing processor.  If we
wind up confirming the above case, then I'll post it.

Sorry, to split hairs here, but you mean the 8259 right?  Just want to be sure
I'm clear on whats going on.  I thought the 8254 was the external timer.

I'm sorry, I can't find ioapic_8259 defined anywhere.  Where is that supposed to
be?  Show me where its defined and I'll happily write the patch.

Unfortunately nothing.  We've tried using the local apic timer in a previous
test, and it resulted in no change, as did transitioning the cpu to the apic
timer via a call to switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer.  Its possible I did something
wrong however.
Currently I'm writing a patch that calls setup_ioapic_dest after we call
disable_IO_APIC.  Looking at the implementation, it appears that calling this
function should rewrite the irq routing table in the ioapic to deliver
interrupts to the set of online cpus, as defined by the TARGET_CPUS macro.  I
asusme that if the ioapic is in virtual wire mode from the call to
disablie_IO_APIC, then calling setup_ioapic_dest will force interrupts to be
delivered to the crashing cpu, as it should be the only bit set in the online
cpu mask.  Please feel free to poke holes in this idea.
Thanks & Regards
