There are some people who use PCMCIA on SMP desktop boxes; many
wireless network cards are only made as PCMCIA cards, and the "desktop
version" consists of an ISA or PCI card reader plus a card.
It is not a configuration that I currently test.  I am told it mostly
works, though some client drivers are not SMP safe.  It is something
that should be fixed eventually, for sure, but given the number of
open issues with PCMCIA in 2.4, I don't think it is high on the list.
If you want to say that PCMCIA on SMP is unsupported until someone
carefully checks it out and fixes these things, I suppose that's fine.
