Hi all,
The following patches changes the behavior of otg tpl and makes it
more compliant to otg specs.
The 5th patch shouldn't be applied and is against musb driver which
you can find in linux-omap git tree. It's here just to show another
feature that could be done with otg tpl; make it come from platform_data.
Any comments are welcome.
Best regards,
Felipe Balbi
