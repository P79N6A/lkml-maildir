Currently no code or a way to do this for all kernels neither in user, 
nor in kernel space, AFAIK. 
Several tools need it. 
Old kernels gave a non-perfect solutions. Today there is a worse approach,
no alternativa and uncontrolled, released, buggy zombie tools are
following what the kernel says: trash the partition table.
Due to the geometry change reported by the kernel and _additional_
partitioning software bugs, sometimes even the layout of existing
partitions are changed, aligned to new, bogus cylinder boundary. Thus not
only Windows but Linux or any other partitions get trashed too in cases.
This kernel geometry change exposed several _different_ partitioning bugs.

In different situations you must use different methods to get the needed
"geometry". 
When you read the geometry from an existing partition table then you
basically don't care about geometry. If it was broken then you won't break
it. If it was good then your values must be good too. But see below.
However there are cases like empty partition table, fixing partition table
if asked, mkntfs, ntfsck, etc when you need the bootloader friendly
geometry what I suspect is the EDD geometry, usually. Linux can't do that:
HDIO_GETGEO doesn't tell and no user space code that could be used for all
kernels.
