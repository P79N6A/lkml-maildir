So, good news, kernel boot and raw hardisk perfs (hdparm -t)
are event a little better.
Bad news : 
- irq balancing/routing is one more time broken

- when I try to format my cdrw with cdrwtool -d /dev/sr0 -q,
the red led of the scsi bus activity ligth on, scsi bus lock
(I could switch console and try to log in but without succes
since hdd could not be reach), all without any message on the
console and few seconds later, the machine is killed with a
kernel panic : "Fatal exception in Interrupt" in 
ahc_handle_seqint +0x371/0x1055 [aic7xxx]
If you want, I could send you a screen-shot of the panic taken
with my phone tomorow (I need a windows computer to get the
picture out of my phone).
Regards,
Emmanuel.
