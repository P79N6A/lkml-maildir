I know.  You can "fix" this problem by changing the if statement to  
this:
if (__builtin_constant_p(ptr) || __builtin_constant_p((ptr == NULL)))
On the other hand, calling kfree(ptr) on a non-NULL constant pointer  
is a bug and will crash, and calling kfree(ptr) on a NULL constant  
ptr is just dead code and we should find and kill that separately.   
There's no reason to ever call kfree(<constant>).
