I'm looking for some SATA RAID controller supported by Linux.  I want
a real hardware RAID, not just a label.  So far, I've seen 3ware and
Adaptec have some boards that seem to be supported.
Now the question is, will any of these work in a non-intel machine?
If I configure the array on a PC, will it still be accessible on an
Alpha machine?
What about status monitoring?  Do those cards support standard things,
like SMART?
I happen to have an Alpha machine with 64-bit PCI, so it would make a
nice file server with one of those cards.
I've tried mailing 3ware, but they don't seem to reply.
