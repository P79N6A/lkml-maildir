Hello Friend.
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe
Everyone will die someday. My name is Dasuki AL-Mehmood, a merchant
in Dubai U.A.E.
I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of
Medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,
According to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so
Well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business.
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people
and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just
Wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would
Live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has
Called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my
Immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
Anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria
and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have
left for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $6M.
(Six  Million United States Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
Dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10 % for you and
for your time. All correspondence should be directed via this private email
dasuk-al-mehmo@excite.com
May Allah be with you.
