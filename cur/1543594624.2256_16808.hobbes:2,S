OK, my corruption is back and this time I'm saving the data.  Al, send some 
email when you are around, we can talk about access to the data.  I'm tarring
up both good & bad right now.  I've looked at a few files and they look
"shifted".
	extra junk
	original file less sizeof(extra junk) bytes
The machine has been up 6 days since the last corruption happened and the
process which detected the corruption ran successfully every night as well
as about 4 times by hand after my last corroption report.
