What, merging patches that have never even been seen by the relevant
subsystem maintainer(s)?
I've never seen any of those SPI patches before, and am not inclined
to try plucking three of them out of a composite patch for a separate
review ...
Same goes for GPIO, for that matter.  It's harder to goof those up,
but it's still possible.  If those were reviewed I personally might
be inclined to OK merges after RC1; GPIOs get used almost everywhere.
(Pretty much as Bryan commented...)  Those look more like portmux
changes than GPIO changes though.
