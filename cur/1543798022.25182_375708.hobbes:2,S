How do you know what wget did after the connection was refused?
Didn't it close its socket when returning to the shell?

But you said the connection was refused. Wget wouldn't have sent
anything.

You can always display the results of fcntl(s, F_GETFL) after
changing it to see if it "works".
Did you use setsockopt() to set the socket to SO_BSDCOMPAT if you
are porting or copying BSD code?

Also, since probably 90% of the Web-Pages accessed on the Internet
are served by Linux servers, it is highly unlikely that Linux is
doing something wrong in its socket code. FYI, there is a seperate
networking list........
