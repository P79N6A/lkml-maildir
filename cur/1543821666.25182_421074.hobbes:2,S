Erm, why was one built on NAND and one on NOR?  You're comparing
apples to oranges now.
You're also comparing different price points.  Depending on various
factors, NAND flash can be 3x cheaper than NOR.  But I agree that
economics should be left out of this discussion.  There are people
that want to use XIP, and economics has nothing to do with the
technology that enables that to happen.

If the NAND device was a small block device, summary support won't
really help at all there.

JFFS2 does incur a bit of DRAM overhead.  There are a couple things
kicking around that might help that consumption, but not in the
magnitude you're mentioning here.
