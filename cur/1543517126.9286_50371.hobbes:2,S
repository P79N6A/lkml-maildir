Hi,
I urgently needed kdb for 2.3.30-pre2 so I made a clean patch here:
http://www.avnet.co.uk/~ely/kdb-2.3.30-pre2.patch.gz
Notes:
a) moved kdb_vmlist_check to be static in kdb/kdbsupport.c as vmlist is
no longer static in mm/vmalloc.c (it is used also by ELF /proc/kcore)
b) dropped the support for kdb over serial console - sorry it didn't work 
anyway and I didn't have time to fix it. (hence my patch is only useful 
for those who do not need serial kdb stuff).
Regards,
Tigran.
