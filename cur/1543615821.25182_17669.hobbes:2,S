<<* Given an address as an int (of the appropriate size), I need a way
  to construct a pointer, which when dereferenced, will result in the
  CPU presenting that address to the MMU.
* I need a way to tell the compiler not to make any assumptions about
  what objects that such a pointer might or might not point to, so
  that the effect of dereferencing the pointer is simply to access the
  memory at the address I gave, and is not considered "undefined"
  regardless of how I might have constructed the address.

So that seems reasonable as a statement of need (i.e. a high level
requirement), so what is needed now is to craft a well defined way
in GNU C, preferably other than ASM inserts, to achieve this very
reasonable goal.
