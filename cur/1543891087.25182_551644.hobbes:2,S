I think that Thomas's point is that he is optimally removing
function tracing via #ifdef.
Your 600KB patch, on the other hand, permanently removed the feature
and touched every file in ACPICA.
The net effect to the user is the same, the ability to enable
ACPI_DEBUG and not enable ACPICA function tracing.
As I probably wrote a year ago, it isn't viable to completely
remove the tracing code --
until Linux reaches a point where vendors certify that their
BIOS is compatible with Linux before they ship, rather than the Linux
community having to debug some Windows-compatible systems into
Linux-compatibility well after they have shipped into the field.
