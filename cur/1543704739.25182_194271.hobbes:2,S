Hi Andi,
I'm using CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO, but I used a different mechanism to
select it when KGDB is selected.  I'm still learning to speak Kconfig.
My patch:
   config KGDB
        bool "Include kgdb kernel debugger"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        select DEBUG_INFO
        help
          If you say Y here, the system will be compiled with the debug
Your patch:
  config DEBUG_INFO
        bool "Compile kernel with debug information" if !KGDB
        default y
Using "select DEBUG_INFO" selects the option and makes the input box
on xconfig disappear.  The line describing the option remains, perhaps
leaving a user wondering why this line doesn't have an input box.
With your version, the DEBUG_INFO option disappears when KGDB forces
it on.
I was looking for a way to get the old behavior where the 
the effect was controlled by an OR of the two options.
