Greetings all;
I have a pcHDTV-3000 card in this box.  This is a cx88 based card AFAIK.
I had a need to check something with tvtime today and found it couldn't 
open /dev/video0
Checking in /dev, there indeed is no such animal, or anything seemingly video 
related.
An lsmod|grep cx88 returns:
cx8802                 13572  0
cx8800                 25568  0
compat_ioctl32          1280  1 cx8800
cx88xx                 56612  2 cx8802,cx8800
ir_common              29444  1 cx88xx
i2c_algo_bit            5124  1 cx88xx
video_buf              18308  3 cx8802,cx8800,cx88xx
btcx_risc               3848  3 cx8802,cx8800,cx88xx

i2c_core               17808  6

A grep of dmesg for cx88 returns:
cx2388x cx88-mpeg Driver Manager version 0.0.6 loaded
Which seems a rather sparse return to me.
 
And I have this in my rc.local to load it all:
modprobe nvidia-agp
modprobe -r cx8802 cx8800 cx88-alsa cx88xx
modprobe cx88xx tuner=60
modprobe cx8800
modprobe cx8802
I had been getting an error from the rc.local at startup in the logs, and took 
the offending line out about 2 weeks ago, but I believe it did work prior to 
that.
Can anyone spot the mistake above?  Or do we have a real problem with rc8?
Thanks.
