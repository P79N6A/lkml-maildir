Hi
people thanks for all sugestions.
So i am thinking expand just anonymous memory (vm_flags = NULL) , how do you 
think is the best away to share this memory between Linux A and B on the net ?
I have a source like mmap that create a anonymous memory space , but it can 
use just in local machine , and i´d like to share this space with another box.
thanks
Breno
