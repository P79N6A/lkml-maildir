LILO could not find all of your kernel, probably because you
overwrote it without executing lilo.
It is not sufficient to just copy the boot image to /boot or
wherever your distributor decided to put it. You must re-execute
lilo. Lilo builds a table containing the offsets to each of
the file pieces. When you are booting, there is no file-system
so the boot-loader uses these table entries to assemble the
pieces of linux during the boot.
