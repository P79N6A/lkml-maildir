So if I report a bug I must be subscribed to your list to get the answer,
that's it ? 
You don't have to 'come search me out'. *I* sent you a bug report, the least
you could do is to CC: me on the answers. (Or gently tell me that this is
a known bug being discussed on your list and inviting me to go there to
find the answers).

As I said in the previous mail, I did check the archives and saw nothing
trivially relevant. But of course, I could have missed something.

Keeping the development discussions on your own list is of course ok,
but I believe posting an announce on lkml each time you send something
for inclusion in the main kernel would be a good idea. Especially when
you're not sending patches every day and when your patches tend to be
considerably big.
This is what (a lot of) other subsystem maintainers do.
