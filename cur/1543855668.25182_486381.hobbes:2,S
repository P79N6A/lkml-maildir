Hey Andi,
	First let me apologize, I've been busy with other things and 
its been far too long since I last posted this. Anyway, I found some 
time to resync my trees and wanted to send this along.
You had asked earlier about performance impact:
Vanilla TSC:
149 nsecs per gtod call
367 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
288 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
Vanilla ACPI PM:
1272 nsecs per gtod call
1335 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
1273 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
GENERIC_TIME TSC:
149 nsecs per gtod call
304 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
275 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
GENERIC_TIME ACPI PM:
1273 nsecs per gtod call
1275 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
1273 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
So almost no performance change.
Ingo has a few cleanups I need to merge, but otherwise I think this is 
getting close to ready for inclusion into -mm for testing. Please let 
me know if you have any major objections and if not I'll re-diff it 
against -mm and send it to Andrew. 
New in the current C7 release:
o Synched up w/ 2.6.19-rc6-git11
o Reworked the patch order to be a bit more logical
o Dropped the apic_runs_main_timer removal on Andi's request
Let me know if you have any thoughts or comments!
thanks again!
-john
