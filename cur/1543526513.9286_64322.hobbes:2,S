Don't worry about that. The fuction module knows about its data
structures, which are all set up but empty-ish. The data module
loads, sees the existing data structures, says aha! and modifies
them according to a big table it has built in. It then goes away.

This analysis "turns out not to be the case". The function module
must work on its own, as it will be left alone in the kernel when
the big data module goes away.

This is the intended scenario (but dependency of the data module
on the function module is both harmless and necessary).
Bouncing a file content data into the module via explicit reads or other
mechanisms is possible, but I don't like it for several reasons.
