Assuming they work.  No offense to the guys who got the ball rolling, but
the architecture is lousy, and every driver I have messed with does not
work correctly, and I wind up reimplementing it before I can use it.
I actually like the idea of ECC drivers, and routinely make certain
there is a working ECC driver on the systems I ship.  It is so much
very easier to catch memory errors with good ECC error reporting.  But
unless I have slept soundly through a fundamental change, the
linux-ecc project currently does not ship quality drivers.  The
infrastructure is bad, and the code is not quite correct. 
If you want I can dig up the drivers I am currently using and send
them to you.
I even have a working memory scrub routine.
