I was going to keep quiet, but I have to say this: If Suspend2 can rightly be 
called unreviewed code, it's only because you've been too busy flaming etc to 
give it serious review. Personally, though, I don't think it's right to call 
it unreviewed. I've had and applied feedback from lots of people over time 
(hch, Rafael, Pekka(sp?), Nick, Con and Hugh to name just a few). If they 
weren't reviewing the code, what were they doing?
Regards,
Nigel
