Performing the same tests: producing 8 bit hashes from 800,000
filenames.
Speed is 10 seconds, comarable to hash_mem
normalised standard deviation of frequencies is 0.0171039
which is is the same ball park as the hashes ext3 uses
(they gave 0.0169 and 0.0182.  hash_mem gave 0.02255).
So (on this set of values at least) it does seem to be a better hash
function. 
I might look more closely at it.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
