Yup.

Ack.  Clearly some sort of semantical checking would be nice to have,
but for the moment, we still need humans to do that job.  Thanks!

Yes, same problem.

For sure.  But since I scale extremely badly, I try to distribute this
work.  Thanks for taking a share.
There are a few more spots worth looking at, though.  I have no idea,
how often the loops below can iterate, so they may cause problems as
well.  If they are harmless as well, xfs is in a good state wrt stack
usage.  Nice.
