Did you even read what James wrote ?
When one of the disks in a RAID array develops a bad block
it shouldn't stall the box for minutes when the error can
be handled by simply doing the IO from other disks instead.

This suggests we shouldn't put all kinds of non-scsi devices
under the SCSI stack and should have a more generic block and
character device layer instead ...

... and here you contradict what you said above.
Will you do the honours or are you waiting for somebody else
