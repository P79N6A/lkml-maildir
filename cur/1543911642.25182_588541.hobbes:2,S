If I understand the code, anything it whinges about is either an outright bug
or it's a round of ammo already chambered. ;)
As far as "something else wrong", I'm still seeing these in -rc3-mm1, but
they've been reported before against -rc2-mm2, I think:
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/ostype .1.1 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/osrelease .1.2 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/version .1.4 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/hostname .1.7 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/domainname .1.8 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/shmmax .1.34 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/shmall .1.41 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/shmmni .1.45 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/msgmax .1.35 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/msgmni .1.42 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/msgmnb .1.36 Missing strategy
[    0.628000] sysctl table check failed: /kernel/sem .1.43 Missing strategy
And this isn't on an allyesconfig or allmodconfig. There may well be sysctl
code I didn't hit - my /lib/modules/2.6.23-rc3-mm1 is only about 10M, and
the Fedora kernels are weighing in at about 75M of /lib/modules a pop.
