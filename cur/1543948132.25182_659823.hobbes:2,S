i dont think it's worth it on x86, because it has no real meaning so it 
will just be an arbitrary thing that deteriorates over time.
Subarchitectures on x86 are just a shortcut for the "0.1% of systems 
that were lazy to be properly abstracted into the general PC code". We 
are discouraging additional subarches and the one that got added 
recently will go away soon. The rest is legacy.
Really, we should concentrate our testing to where our _testers_ are and 
where our developers are.
And according to lkml, 
http://kerneloops.org
 and a 300,000+ sample 
http://smolt.fedoraproject.org/static/stats/stats.html
 statistics, our 
testers are distributed like this:
 - more than 90% of all kernel developers use general PC hardware
 - more than 95% of our active testers use general PC hardware
 - more than 99.1% of our distro users that are willing to send us
   feedback use general PC hardware as well
(In that aspect i dont count the million(s?) of non-x86 Linux based 
phones as "a million users", unless they become an active part of our 
ecosystem and do things like hook into kerneloops.org. It's that simple, 
really.)
