About two years ago, in the days of 2.0.30 and 2.1.43, I carefully
tuned __{add,remove}_wait_queue in kernel-typical contexts for
gcc-2.7.2 on i586s & K5s for speed and size.  I had a version of
__remove_wait_queue using the wait_queue argument too.  It didn't
crash linux in my configuration, but I decided not to use it, as it
could have exposed broken kernel-code and I didn't want to risk to
break anything.
Using the list argument to remove_wait_queue in my opinion is not
something to do in the 2.2.x series.
