The second s390 patchset for 2.6.23. This one contains bug fixes as
usual and one new feature: the z/VM unit record device driver (vmur).
This driver allows to access the virtual reader, punch and printer
when running under z/VM. This is useful, e.g. to access the spool
file containing a dump of the system generated with vmdump, or to
set up a bootable system in the reader.
