Thanks again, but if the whole of the kernel is restricted to couple of pages.
Does this mean
a) the whole of the kernel including drivers is restricted to couple of pages.
b) Or with a more probability, I think what you actually mean is that
whenever there is an interrupt by any driver it runs in either context
of the current process or depending upon CONFIG_IRQSTACKS.
If you could just quote the chapter, in your book which contains
information  about this, that would be more than sufficient.

Actually what I asked above was "how exactly does one define and
differentiate kernel stack", as against "user-stack". I think I always
knew it but couple of clouds were coming over after reading your first
mail. Also if each thread has a kernel stack how is it allocated at
first place (alloc_thread_info)(?)
Thanks.
