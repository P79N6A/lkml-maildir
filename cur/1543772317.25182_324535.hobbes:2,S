No, I'm 99% sure it's not. Otherwise the damned thing would work without
any patches, since all devices in the dock have reasonable addresses.
It's just one bridge in the middle that hasn't.

True, especially since it's possible to have a lot of devices including
bridges on a single chip, so that limitations mentioned in the PCI spec
do not work anymore. But I hope hardware engineers are sensible enough
not to break rules...

Appended, but hopefully not quite silly. :-)
Though, the reason why the devices in the dock are still inaccessible
is indeed ridiculous - pci_enable_bridges() doesn't work on i386.
It ends up calling pcibios_enable_resources(), which only test first 6
resources and therefore ignores bridge resources completely.
So, even if the bridge ranges have been assigned correctly (according to
Andreas' dmesg), we left the bridge with IO and MEM enable bits
turned off...
The patch applies to clean 2.6.12-rc6. It includes 2 patches from
gregkh-2.6 tree (to pci.h and probe.c). Initially these patches were
intended for ACPI and "cardbus behind subtractive bridge" improvements,
but as it turns out they make setup-bus.c code a lot more happier with
transparent bridges, so many of previous hacks aren't needed.
I'm still not sure if it boots though...
Ivan.
