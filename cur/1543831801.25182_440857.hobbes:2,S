I have added proposed by Nikita lines
		if (pdflush_operation(background_writeout, 0))
                writeback_inodes(&wbc);
and tested it with iozone. The throughput is 50-53 MB/sec. It is less
than 74-105 MB/sec results sent earlier.

I am more concerned, that this patch _limits_ maximal possible writeback
concurrency to MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS.

That sounds a bit too extreme, given that pdflush is used for a lot of
things other than background write-out.

What about replacing
 		pdflush_operation(background_writeout, 0);
with
 		if (pdflush_operation(background_writeout, 0))
                /*
                 * Fall back to synchronous writeback if all pdflush
                 * threads are busy.
                 */
                writeback_inodes(&wbc);
? This will combine increased concurrency in your target case (single
writer) with some safety net in the case of multiple writers and
multiple devices.
