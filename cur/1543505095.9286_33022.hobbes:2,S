Hmm, I actually did support Genius Netmouse (is that what you mean)
long time ago. But I decided two buttons for scrolling are not
interesting and turned them into middle button (sending curses into
author of that mouse because protocol is really broken and mimics MS
Intellimouse.)
You want to talk to vojtech@ucw.cz, he's doing mouse support for linux
now.

I think that gnome can already do scrolling...
