Ah, but the problem is not to fix the utilities -
that is a matter of a few hours at most -
the problem is that five years from now there still
will be people with old versions of the utilities.
We should be extremely slow with breaking old stuff.
After all, we claim that Linux is a stable environment -
not only in the sense that it does not crash, but also
in the sense that it is not necessary to install the
latest versions of everything every three months.
