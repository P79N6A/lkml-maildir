Try commenting out the AUX_RECONNECT block on line 406 in pc_keyb.c
#ifdef CONFIG_PS2_KEYBOARD_SWITCH_COMPATIBILITY_MODE	
	else if(scancode == AUX_RECONNECT){
		queue->head = queue->tail = 0;  /* Flush input queue */
		__aux_write_ack(AUX_ENABLE_DEV);  /* ping the mouse :) */
		return;
	}
#endif
and let me know what happens..
