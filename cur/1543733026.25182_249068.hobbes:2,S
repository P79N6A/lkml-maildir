Well I've always wondered why I couldn't download drivers for my i845 on
board soundcard for Redhat 9 (back when it was a supported distro), why
the hell did I need to go install FC1 or upgrade my kernel to a non-RH
kernel, same with X on the i845, it was crap on RH9 by the time FC1 came
out the i865 was out, the distros play catchup the whole time with new
hardware, why not allow people to download external drivers and use em?
I do take your point that a vendor supplied kernel update will break
everything anyways, but we do have a lot of proprietary driver users that
deal with this and get support for their hardware why should people
supplying open source drivers be worse off.. and that is my view with the
drm at the moment, companies wanting to do the right things are in a worse
position than companies just releasing binary drivers, and that is just
wrong :-), telling your users to get a new kernel isn't a nice way of
doing things, and maybe Fedora is doing things right, but not many other
distros are...
Dave.
