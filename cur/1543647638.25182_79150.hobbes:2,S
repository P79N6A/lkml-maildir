Subject: 2.5.42 raid0 compile failure?

I tried compiling 2.5.42 with gcc 2.95.4.
I use Peter Chubb's raid0 patch which
worked fine with 2.5.41
compiling, I got this:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `raid0_mergeable_bvec':
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xa497d): undefined reference to `__umoddi3'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `raid0_make_request':
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xa4d23): undefined reference to `__umoddi3'
These functions use the % operator with sector_t,
so I guess there is a problem with the new 64-bit sector_t.
