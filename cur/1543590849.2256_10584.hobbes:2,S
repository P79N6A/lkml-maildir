Caching metadata is definately part of my cunning plan. I'd like to
think that once Al's metadata-in-page-cache patches go in, we'll get
that for free.
However, that will still leave indirect blocks unordered. I don't see
a clean way of fixing that. Which is why doing things at the block
device layer has it's attractions (except it doesn't work).
Hm. Is there a reason why the page cache can't see if a a block is in
the block cache, and read it from there first?
