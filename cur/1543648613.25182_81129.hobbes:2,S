Obvious duplicates will be filtered out by the general admins.
More subtle type things will probably need to be by the "owners"
of the bugs, ie yes ... we'll have some sort of assingment of bugs.
Ideally I'd like this to just be the subsystem maintainers as we
have them now, but if they don't want to play, we'll find someone
to act as administrative owner for each technical area that has
experience in that field.
Martin.
