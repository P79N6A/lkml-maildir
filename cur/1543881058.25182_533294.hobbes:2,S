If you do this, and it has been requested many a times, then please
generalize it.  We have the same issue with futexes.  If a FUTEX_WAIT
call is issues the remaining time in the slot should be given to the
thread currently owning the futex.  For non-PI futexes this needs an
extension of the interface but I would be up for that.  It can have
big benefits on the throughput of an application.
