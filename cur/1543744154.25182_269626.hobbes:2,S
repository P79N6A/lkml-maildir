The status change and character receive are asynchronous with respect
to each other anyway.  Consider the case where the serial port says
"we have characters waiting" - we receive a FIFO full of characters.
It then says that the modem status has changed.
You don't actually know when the modem status changed.  It may have
changed before any of these characters were received because character
receiption is is highest priority.
Even if you poll the MSR register after you receive every FIFO character,
you still don't know whether the modem status changed before or after
that character was received.
Therefore, anything which relies on knowing precisely when the modem
status changed in the character stream is unfortunately broken by the
limitations of 8250-based hardware.
