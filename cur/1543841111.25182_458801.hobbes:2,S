Yes, that's _intended_.
Fact:
If you chmod 644 some files on vfat, then unmount and mount it again, they show
up as 755 again. That is ok.
Observation:
Dropping the cache does not imply the 644->755 change observed on unmount.
Conclusion:
Caches not dropped.

It is, I think, for compat reasons. Who knows how many apps don't expect chmod
to fail when they know you are the owner.
thanks,
