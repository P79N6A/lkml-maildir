But there are.  Many controllers just break down and corrupt things
silently if you don't align the data buffers (Jeff Merkey found this
by accident when he started generating unaligned IOs within page
boundaries in his NWFS code).  And a lot of controllers simply cannot
break a sector dma over a page boundary (at least not without some
form of IOMMU remapping).
Yes, it's the sort of thing that you would hope should work, but in
practice it's not reliable.
Cheers,
 Stephen
