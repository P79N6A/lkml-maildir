Sure, sorry if my comment can be treated in this way ... I mean surprising
amount of people I've met criticised Linux (well, some years ago when DOS
was popular) that he/she want to see that 'free memory' field reported eg by
'top' should be the maximum all the time ... I mean this way: this is the
behaviour which is quite wrong, I've written about this.
Sure, because of my not too good English, I may have missed the real meaning
of the mail, sorry about it!
