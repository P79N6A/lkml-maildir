That's exactly where cpu isolation comes in. It makes sure that an isolated 
CPU is excluded from: 
1. HW interrupts. This means no softirq, etc.
2. Things like workqueues, stop machine, etc. This typically means no timers, etc.
3. Scheduler load balancing (we had support for that for awhile now).
All that's left on that CPU is the scheduler tick and IPIs. And those are just fine.
At that point it's up to the app to use or not to use kernel services.
In other words no auditing is required. It's the RT preempt that needs to audit in
order to be general purpose RT.

Yes I'm definitely not selling it as general purpose. And no, it's not just kernel code 
it's a pure user-space code. Carefully designed user-space code that is.
The model is pretty simple. Lets say you have a dual cpu/core box. The app can be 
partitioned like this:
- CPU0 handles HW irqs, runs general services, etc and soft-RT threads
- CPU1 runs hard-RT threads or a special engine. For the description of the engine
see 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120232425515556&w=2
 
hard-RT threads do not need any system call besides pthread_ mutex and signals (those
are perfectly fine).
They can use direct HW access (if needed). ie Memory mapping something and acessing
it without the syscalls (see libe1000.sf.net for example).
Communication between hard-RT and soft-RT thread is lock-less (single reader/single writer
queues, etc).
It may sound fairly limited but you'd be surprised how much you can do. It's relatively
easy to design the app that way once you get a hang of it :). I'm working with our legal 
folks on releasing user-space framework and afore mentioned engine with a bunch of examples.
