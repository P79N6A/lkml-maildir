Compared to getting useful suggestions from a mailing list, especially 
before you've gotten anybody's attention? Hours or overnight isn't 
particularly long, and doesn't take up much of your time if you've got a

I don't think there's anything set up for that, aside from the actual 
build system generating it, and I don't know how hard that would be to 
repurpose for generating a configuration.
