Not sure what to make of this.  It has no changelog, it doesn't apply on
top of your previous three patches:
rtc-m41t00-driver-should-use-workqueue-instead-of-tasklet.patch
rtc-m41t00-driver-cleanup.patch
rtc-add-support-for-m41t81-m41t85-chips-to-m41t00-driver.patch
and it doesn't apply when used to replace
rtc-add-support-for-m41t81-m41t85-chips-to-m41t00-driver.patch.
An incremental patch against the three above patches would be ideal...
