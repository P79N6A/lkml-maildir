Sorry but why don't You run Your application with gdb ?
Once Your program crashes You'll get the prompt and You'll be able to
stack-trace and watching whatever You need.
The solution I use to be able to get inside the program even when the gdb is
not running is the one that You can find in the attached file.
Basically it install the handler that will create a script file that You can
use to automatically enter with gdb inside Your program while it's running.
