Is sd (or sg or whatever) *not* a module in your case?
I think the check is buggy, as it doesn't validate tpnt->module,
IMO you ought to add a check for tpnt->module, and call BUG()
rather than completely removing the check, see the patch below.
If the count is really non zero, the function should not be called
(rmmod won't call into it if the module is in use; if calling via
scsi_register_device_module on failure, it should be impossible
to increment count - it should be impossible to call sd_open or
sg_open).
Here's a patch against 2.4.18:
