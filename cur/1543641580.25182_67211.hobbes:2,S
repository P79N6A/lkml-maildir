Andre, you should probably remove my "patch0" from your patch
(the very first one I sent you to fix PPC compile on -ac so
you could test on your PPC). Alan already have it, I sent it
more for your own tests on PPC than for inclusion in your
patch, which is why I sent it separately from the other IDE
related patches.
Ben.
