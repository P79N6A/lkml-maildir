The beta 2 drop of JFS was made available today.
The file system has fixes included.
In the utility area there is new jfsprogs.spec file
created by Jim Nance. This spec file can be used to create
RPM for the JFS utilities. The file system has general work
done to remove SMP and UP hang related problems. The performance
of the file system has increased by changes to extent inode cache,
also the log manager is no longer uses the page cache for log pages
and this change has increased the performance of the file system.
Joe Nuspl patches have also been included in this drop for the
problems he has found/fixed.
Jim and Joe thanks for your changes.
