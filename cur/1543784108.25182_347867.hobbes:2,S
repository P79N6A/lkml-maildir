There's a latency histogram option in the -rt patch set.  You can pipe
the output through gnuplot and get some cool graphs.  Then you can
use /proc/latency_trace to try and guess what code paths the peaks on
the graphs correspond to.  The timer interrupt will be the biggest peak,
around 23 usecs last time I checked.
I haven't done it lately so it would be interesting to see the current
graphs.  Someone could make a really good presentation out of it at some
kernel development conference.
