Am I being slow? These messages are repeated three times because they 
are prefixed? 2.6.14 also presented the info several times:
PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:KBC,PNP0f13:MICE] at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 4 ports, IRQ sharing disabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
pnp: the driver 'serial' has been registered
pnp: match found with the PnP device '00:09' and the driver 'serial'
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
I don't have a 2.6.15 flavor system handy at the moment, my bleeding 
edge system is being OpenSolaris today :-( Is there value to having this 
apparently duplicate information displayed? It looks like babble, or 
worse some init code being called multiple times, if this is as it 
should be, or useful to some developer fine, I just don't quite read 
that into your answer saying it's prefixed. And I don't see serial8250 
in Gene's post or my dmesg.
