I don't know.
By scanning random copies of kernels left on my drive, I can see that
it changed from a trivial "return 0" to the more interesting check using
cpu_online_map in one of your "linus.patch" patches in the release
2.6.11-rc1-mm2.
But I don't know how to get to the history at this point to see what
happened.
It looks like Linus started the git history at 2.6.12-rc2.
  Could someone clue me in on how to find Linux history BG (before-git)?
Since bk no longer works for me, I have no idea how to access any
history prior to about 2.6.12-rc2.  Ugh.
