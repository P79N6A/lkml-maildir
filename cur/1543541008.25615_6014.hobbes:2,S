Hmmm.  I think qconfig.in and qconfig.out are useful ideas but I think
you can implement them with much less code.
	# Makefile rules
	qconfig:
		cat arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig qconfig.in > .config
		$(MAKE) oldconfig	# or copy the oldconfig rules here
		diff arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig .config \
		    | awk {blah, blah, blah} ... \
		    > qconfig.out
A note to the other people who have replied: qconfig is not the same as
oldconfig.  With qconfig, if a variable is not in qconfig.in, and Linus
changes the default value for that variable in arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig,
qconfig will incorporate that change.  oldconfig won't.
