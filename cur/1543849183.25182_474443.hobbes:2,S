If we intend to make the cpuset to sched_domain interaction
functional, something like this was needed.
However I am now leaning toward thinking that the entire
effort to manipulate sched_domain definitions by cpusets
(the cpu_exclusive flag) has been counter intuitive, and
is borked.
So I will be sending out patches to remove it, and replace
with a trivial mechanism to allow for runtime manipulation
of the cpu_isolated_map.
Coming soon ...
