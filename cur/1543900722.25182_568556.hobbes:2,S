I'm afraid that userland programmers just will not read/follow
this... and we will not know.
[Perhaps CONFIG_STRESS_SYSFS_PARSERS would be useful? Move stuff
randomly to expose broken /sys users?]
Then, we'll get binary-only applications working okay relying on
specific /sys structure, and soon, we'll be unable to change /sys.
[Perhaps we can make large parts of sysfs superuser-only, so that
"normal" application can not rely on it?]
