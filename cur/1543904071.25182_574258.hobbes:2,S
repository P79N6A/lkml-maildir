Well, we could just rewrite the whole kernel in Web and judge all future
patches on how literate they are...
Seriously, though, even if the (small) infrastructure is not going to
take over the driver tree anytime soon, it's hard to imagine why we
would not want to incorporate this sort of documentation.  It's good
stuff, something which can really help people get a sense for how this
whole virtualization thing works.  And it makes the code fun to read.

P.S. I am currently considering a no-limericks policy for the LWN quote
