This is on an Alpha.  I have been getting strange results from some
software.  I investigated, and got these results:
erwin ~/mqueue$ ls -l | grep mail.00937075929.00000
ls: mail.00937075929.00000: No such file or directory
erwin ~/mqueue$ ls | grep mail.00937075929.00000
mail.00937075929.00000
According to strace, ls -l is dying:
lstat("mail.00937075929.00000", 0x1ffff9a0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
So, apparently the file is in the directory, but yet isn't.  I have no 
idea how this can occur.  Ideas?
