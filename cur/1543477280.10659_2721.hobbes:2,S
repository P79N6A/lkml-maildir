Subject: [PATCH] IDE Flags  & a question to the public

Linus,
please include this small patch into the standard Kernel.
It adds one missing Flag.
I am writing a IDE Driver for another OS. Though I have the IDE Specs i
read the linux Source code to
get a impression what to do.
Questions to the public:
Are there any reasons for not using the Flags MCR_ERR & MC_ERR ?
With that we could "automagically" umount a CDROM.
if a user presses the CDROM Button MCR_ERR gets set -> umount DEVICE
OR "automagically" ;) mount a cdrom  (MC_ERR will be set when a MEDIA (
CDROM  ) is inserted - says my SPEC)
Sorry - i have no time to do this.
Regards
Dietmar
