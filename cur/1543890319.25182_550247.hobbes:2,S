ps -ejH displays everything.  For 2.6.22 we will only have kthreadd
as a sibling of init with ppid == 0.  Depending on what happens
in the evolution of how we start kernel thread we may be able
to remove kthreadd and have all kthreads with a ppid of 0, but only
time will tell.

Having the kernel not reparent user processes to init is an interesting
idea, especially when those processes have not existed.  I'm not
certain that is POSIX complaint and otherwise backwards compatible.
