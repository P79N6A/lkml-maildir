Why don't you try to explain the problem in more depth, but without
assuming a solution at all.  Just talk about what you're trying to
fix.  
As a SysAdmin by trade, if the program is written sanely, it's not
hard to make it relocateable and runable from anywhere.  It's when the
program *knows* or the libraries is uses *know* that stuff is in
certain locations that things break.  
I'm really writing from memory here, since I first saw your proposal
and looked it over and went "why bother?" but didn't have the time to
check it out in detail.
