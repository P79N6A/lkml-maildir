The 2.2 stack is under two independent locks (kernel lock and bh lock).
In later 2.2 the expensive parts of the TX path (copy
and checksum) run outside the kernel lock. About half of Incoming runs 
in the serialized NETBH, but you can save a lot of that by using 
a NIC that that supports hardware checksumming like the Tornado.
The copy from kernel to user in RX runs outside the kernel lock again 
in later 2.2 and can work fully in parallel.
Checksumming and copying are the really expensive parts of TCP, you
can say that 50-60% of 2.2 TCP are already fully SMP multithreaded because of
these simple tricks.
2.4 has a more finegrained locking, but it'll of course cost you
in most cases (locks are expensive and generate lots of slow bus traffic)
