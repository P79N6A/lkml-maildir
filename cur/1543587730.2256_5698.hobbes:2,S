If a resync is required, it is because we can derive the correct information
*without* having the array in sync  (resync puts correct information in places
where we know it's not currently correct).   fsck can never see "old" information,
no matter the state of the resync.  If it could, RAID would be broken.
Levels 1, 4 and 5 need a resync - but they all give you the correct
information even *before* resync.
Levels 0 and linear cannot be synced (and will fail if you pull a disk, all because
they do not have redundant information).   Talking about sync in these cases doesn't
make sense.

I think the problem is that RAID throttles based on bandwidth, not based on
requests.  If fsck needs a lot of seeking, the RAID code won't notice that
the array is being used much, and thus won't throttle a lot.
Also, even if fsck does large sequential reads, the RAID code may throttle,
but it will then introduce small frequent seeks to when it updates a few
blocks every now and then.  Seeks have a huge impact on otherwise sequential
reads.

Oh, do we resync blocks that are read ? I didn't know that actually...
This should give little overhead on RAID-1, since most reads would be done
on one disk and the "older disk" (the one being synced with information from
the newer one) would only be written to.

If we resync RAID-1 blocks as they are read, I don't understand the claimed
performance impact of resync.
