I gave this program a try as well.
Eject has been failing on my laptop for quite a few kernel
revisions.  Even using the keyboard's Fn+F10 fails.
Failures come with an extended beep -- 2 seconds or so --
and a system pause (smbios I presume).
Your eject (edited only to use /dev/hdb) reports:
:; ~/src/jens-eject 
command failed - sense 2/53/0
