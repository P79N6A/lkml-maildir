MPOL_BIND uses direct pointers to zones, the others just node numbers
and fall back to other zones.  Lost node numbers should be pretty easy to 
deal with because there is enough redirection. MPOL_BIND is a bit more
difficult.
My prefered solution would be to never actually remove the zone datastructure,
but just make them zero size when their memory is gone. Then the mempolicies 
could still keep pointers to them, but any allocations will fail.
This may require putting them into different memory though (currently
they are usually in the node itself) 
This should also allow cpumemset to work.
Of course the applications may not be very happy when all the memory
they are allowed to touch is gone, but fixing that is imho more
a high level user space management problem, nothing the kernel
should try to resolve.
