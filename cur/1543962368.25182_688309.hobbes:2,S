I join in on this question. I have written a howto on our linux raid
page, that exactly advocates a way to with 2 drives use these 2 drives
for multiple partitions, of different types of RAID. The partitions
include /boot / /home and swap - which are actually all allocated 
as RAID partitions on the same 2 drives. See
http://linux-raid.osdl.org/index.php/Preventing_against_a_failing_disk
I am trying to advocate that this be a recommended setup for normal
workstations, to for the price of one extra harddisk get additional
safety and performance.
My take is that Linux RAID code is so stable, including in the degarded
mode, that this is robust and stable. However, there are still bugs to
be found, so you can never be 100 % sure.
