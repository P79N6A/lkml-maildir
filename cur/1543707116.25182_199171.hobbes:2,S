hi,
today i played around with some benchmarks i do from time to time [1]
this time with 2.4.24 and the cryptoloop patch
(patch-cryptoloop-jari-2.4.22.0, applies to 2.4.24 too) when using this
machine (powerpc)
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/2.4.24-benh/ver_linux
in short: i have a 700 MB file, losetup a loop device with a cipher
(aes,cast5,cast6,blowfish,serpent,twofish), create an ext3 fs on it.
then test with "tiobench" (size is only about 100MB). but the benchmarks
did not last very long, i have these messages in my syslog:
Dec 21 23:42:45 sheep kernel: __alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed

full log excerpt on:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/2.4.24/messages-alloc_pages
i am then able to sysrq-S, but not all partitions can be synced, then i
try sysrq-E / -I / -U with no luck, nothing seems to be written/read
to/from the disk, sysrq-B works :-)
i did manage to make earlier tests with different filesystems [2] and
linux 2.4.22 and have never had these messages.
Thanks for your hints,
Christian.
