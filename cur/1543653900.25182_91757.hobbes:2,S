Still, neat scripts.
Statically searching code has a lot of applications that run-time
checking does not have.  For example, there _are_ a lot of things you do
not want to call from interrupts: down(), kmalloc() without GFP_ATOMIC,
etc. etc.
And could you get it to check for code paths that could possibly
double-acquire the same lock?
etc. etc... be creative.

No problem.
