Of course, using inotify on proc will not (and should not) actually reap 
dead processes, meaning waitpid() isn't obviated by the change (though 
now it is always called on a specific pid and is never expected to block 
or EAGAIN). We also introduce a new gotcha for userspace programs: this 
mechanism works identically for child and non-child processes, so a 
process may or may not be waitable when returned. A simple "do not shoot 
self in foot" should suffice for this though.
Also, it doesn't work if /proc hasn't been mounted, which just so 
happens to matter for my particular use cases :)

Changes to structure are more interesting in terms of this particular 
problem anyway, and definitely simpler to capture.
