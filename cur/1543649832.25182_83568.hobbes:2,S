> I'm experimenting with different csum_ routines in userspace now.
Short conclusion: 
1. It is possible to speed up csum routines for AMD processors by 30%.
2. It is possible to speed up csum_copy routines for both AMD and Intel
   three times or more. Roy, do you like that? ;)
Tests: they checksum 4MB block and csum_copy 2MB into second 2MB.
POISON=0/1 controls whether to perform correctness tests or not.
That slows down test very noticeably. What does glibc use for
memset/memcmp? for() loop?!!
With POISON=1 ntqpf2_copy bugs out, see its source. I left it in
to save repeating my work by others. BTW, i do NOT understand why
it does not work. ;) Anyone with cluebat?
IMHO the only way to make it optimal for all CPUs is to make these
functions race at kernel init and pick the best one.

Csum benchmark program

Each test tried 16 times, max and min CPU cycles are reported.
Please disregard max values. They are due to system interference only.
