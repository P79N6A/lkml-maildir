I'm one of the ppc people so I don't really count, but...
I've used bitkeeper for the kernel for a year now.
One of the issues in the "network of people" approach is how much time
and effort it takes to maintain a separate tree while waiting for
changes to be merged into the main tree.  Bitkeeper really helps here.
I've been maintaining a tree with significant differences from the
mainline linuxppc tree, and I can pull and merge new changes without
hand-editing a file 99% of the time.  Maintaining my own tree is now a
minor annoyance, instead of a major pain.
