Good! This means the suggested fix is working :)
However, my original proposal:
   
http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/595/
also removed printing the version query result in elantech_init() to keep
the amount of log messages the same.

Dmitry suggested moving the Elantech detection down in psmouse_extensions()
in psmouse-base.c to make the mouse detection less chatty:

However, Alexander pointed out he did not move it far enough down:
   
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/22/18
It should have been moved all the way down below the call to
im_explorer_detect() for him to not see the extra Elantech detection noise.
Now, it is Dmitry's call again to determine whether he really wants to move
the call to elantech_detect() that far down or can live with the extra log
messages... :)
