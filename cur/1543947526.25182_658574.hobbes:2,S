The simple (for me) workflow I use is to create a clone of the
kernel for each 'topic' I work on.
So at the same time I may have one or maybe up to five clones of the
kernel.
When I want to combine thing I use git format-patch and git am.
Often there is some amount of editing done before combining stuff
especially for larger changes where the first in the serie is often
preparational work that were identified in random order when I did
the inital work.
