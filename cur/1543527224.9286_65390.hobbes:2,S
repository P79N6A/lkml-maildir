Hi guys,
What do you mean unmaintained?! It is very well (well, as time and other
duties permits) maintained and the official ABI site is:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches
The old official site was ftp.infradead.org/pub/abi but it just has a
README pointing to my site. We (at least myself) look only after the
latest version of ABI, i.e. the latest patch I made was against 2.3.44 I
think... Only a week ago I fixed a few bugs in it, so I do occassionally
check that it still works and yesterday I received a user bugreport from
someone trying to run MicroFocus COBOL under ABI - I am still debugging
that one.
Regards,
