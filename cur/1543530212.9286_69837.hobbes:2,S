There are plenty of these solutions where rewriting code can satisfy a
change to the kernel and avoid these problems. Would you like to hack
emacs (and everything else, for that matter) to vfork()/exec() instead? :)
In the best case, it will be a change that is entirely transparent to
userspace and works perfectly, or at least well enough that nobody minds
ignoring the few people who scream in horror when it breaks something dear
to them :) That's what people naturally want to aim for. It'll be 
interesting to see how this is resolved (if it's resolved).
