But header files already basically are self-contained. They didn't always 
use to be that way, but over the years, we've generally made them that way 
in almost all cases.
The problem is generally not that they aren't self-contained, it's that 
they bring in other things depending on architecture, and then some driver 
depends on a header file including other header files, even when that 
isn't always the case at all: exactly because which header file it 
includes depends on config options (to a small degree) and on architecture 
(to a much larger degree).
