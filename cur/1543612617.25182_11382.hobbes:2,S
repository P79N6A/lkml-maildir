I know.  I meant we should continue to support the drm-4.0 package. 
It's the usual song ... we shouldn't change interfaces or required tools
in a stable series, and the least we can do is make 4.0 available
somehow, because someone may rely on it.
On the flip side, I don't care, and I suspect the people who actually
are using DRM are on 4.1 now.  Further, if _you_ are maintaining the
cruft and it bothers _you_, then stop :)
