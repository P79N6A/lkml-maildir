On some architectures there are no bits left.  On others you'd need to go
through whomever maintains the relevant psABI to get a bit officially
allocated.  Really, it is very bad idea to use e_flags for this.
If all you care about is running setuid LISP programs, you'd much better put
your energy into fixing the buggy ELF dumper in it.
