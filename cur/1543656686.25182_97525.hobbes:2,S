Hello,
I have a Tyan Thunder K7XPro based server with the onboard AIC7902 
controllers. At the present time, its is running 2.4.19 patched with 
Adaptec's source release for the SCSI support. Adaptec's drivers did not 
  seamlessly integrate into the 2.4.19 kernel. I found an old mail 
stating that support for this chipset would be added eventually. It 
doesn't appear to be added to the 2.4 series yet. Is there something I 
should be concerned about with regards to my server? The overall 
performance and stability seem fine so far, but it is a relatively new 
box with only about 1 month in production - so far so good :)
According to Justin at Adaptec, the source has been given to both Linus 
and Marcelo. I'd sure like to see it in mainline to avoid having to hack 
it in there as it stands. Thanks.
