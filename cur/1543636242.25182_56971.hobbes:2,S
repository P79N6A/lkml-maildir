Mostly to cap the amount of storage to maintain in kernel space, and
for historical reasons.

The main problem is programs who do things like:
gid_t mygroups[NGROUPS];
Other than that, it should all be in kernel space.  According to
POSIX, the NGROUPS above really should be sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) --
NGROUPS_MAX is defined as a *guaranteed minimum* of
sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX).  Obviously there needs to be a kernel ->
libc interface for the sysconf.
FWIW, POSIX specifies:
      Application writers should note that {NGROUPS_MAX} is not
      necessarily a constant on all implementations.
(glibc has #define NGROUPS NGROUPS_MAX).

There probably is.
