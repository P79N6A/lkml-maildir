Sure, everything can always be better.  Reasonable is reasonable.  If
you want more than reasonable then use BK.

Actually that's not been the case to date, it's held pretty constant
and in fact the ratio has gotten better.  The last time we visited 
these numbers it wasn't as good as it is today in CVS>

"A big part"?  What big part?  You are fixated on something that doesn't
have any value.  You're complaining about losing information that CVS
wouldn't have recorded if you were using CVS.  The CVS export tree has
MORE information than you would have if all the development had been 
done under CVS.  Explain to me why this information is suddenly so 
valuable to you?  Explain to me why all the people using all the CVS
maintained projects in the world aren't whining about all the lost 
information.

I stand by the 3 month number.

Right but people agree to not use BK to compete with us.  It's a form
of payment for the product, we give it to you for no money and you agree
not to copy the product and take away our business.
I realize you hate this, it curtails your freedom, there are a thousand
reasons not to like it, I wouldn't like it if I were in your shoes.
I get it, it's a miserable arrangement.  However, we took a huge risk
handing you and everyone else our product for free.  It works better, you
can see that, and you are just the sort to try and reverse engineer it.
As a business strategy it was foolish.  But it wasn't a business decision,
it was a choice that I made because I wanted to help Linus.
And it worked.  That ought to have some value in your eyes.  Maybe
enough to respect our terms.
