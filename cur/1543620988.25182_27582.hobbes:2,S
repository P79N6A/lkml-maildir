Yow, your message inspired me to re-read SuSv2 and indeed confirm,
sync(2) schedules I/O but can return before completion, while
fsync(2) schedules I/O and waits for completion.
So we need to implement system call checkpoint(2) ?  schedule I/O,
introduce an I/O barrier, then sleep until that I/O barrier and all I/O
scheduled before it occurs.
