I cannot repeat the experiment (due to lack of time) but i remember
having severe issues with low /proc/*/swappiness values on vanilla
kernels. I don't recall the nature of the problems, though, because it's
been a while. Sorry. But that was what prompted me to search further.
The search ended when i found and tested Con's patch.
The current swapping policy of the vanilla 2.6 kernels is broken. Badly.
At least my system works properly now. <shrug>
