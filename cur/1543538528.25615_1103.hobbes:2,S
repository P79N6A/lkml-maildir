The point is that modprobe will be a general problem:
many modules will freeze your box for dozen if not hundreds of msecs.
( eg aic7xxx )
We can live with this if we require that the user insmods all the modules
at  boottime. 
The problem could be the audiomatic module loading / cleaning 
(kmod).
For example how do we know in advance that the user wants to use
pppd ? (ppp.o , slhc.o )
If he is offline while doing low-latency audio , and suddenly needs
something from the net, as soon as he fires up pppd, a latency-peak
may occur.
So a  way to avoid latency peaks would be to inform the user, that
if (during his audio recording sessions) he wants to do some stuff which
requires module loading , he has to preload the modules at boottime,
and disable automatic module cleanup.
Anyone better ideas ?
Benno.
