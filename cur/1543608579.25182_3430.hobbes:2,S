We're being extremely conservative about patches applied to the 2.95.x
CVS branch.  It is intended always to be release-quality material.
I'm not aware of any plans for an official 2.95.4 anytime soon.
However, system integrators often track that CVS branch with their GCC
packages.  For instance:
$ gcc -v
