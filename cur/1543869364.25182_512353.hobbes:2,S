You have a point there but I still don't think it should be in bitops.h. 
Why should we favor long-wrap before byte-wrap, so what do you think 
about doing:
#define BITWRAP(x)	BIT((x) % BITS_PER_LONG)
in input.h? Otherwise I think it should be call LBITWRAP (or something) 
to both show what kind it is and enable us to add others later.

No problem :)
It is of course always a good idea to send the patches to yourself and 
then trying to apply that patch to see it is alright. But sometimes you 
can't get the mailer working, then sendpatchset can be of interest:
