I agree with Rob that the amount of required dependencies should be
kept to a minimum.
If we only use 0.5% of a certain language (or: dependent package),
then rather implement
that 0.5% in the existing language.
Dependencies very quickly become dependency hell. If A requires B,
then A also inherits all
(future) requirements of B, etc. etc.
In my daily software development work with Linux and GNU software in
general, 10% of it is spent fighting/removing these extremely "thin"
or false depencies, so that it is usuable in embedded devices.
