Same here - /proc/cpuinfo says:
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 15
model           : 2
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 Mobile CPU 1.60GHz
Question for those more knowledgeable: Are there any known Pentium4 features
enabled in the kernel with the PENTIUM4 options that simply Will Not Work on a
4M chipset (similar to a kernel built for a 586 not working on a 486), or are
the differences limited to "sub-optimal performance" (for example, compiling
with -mpentium4 results in code that runs but schedules less optimally)?  If
there are, they must be fairly obscure corner cases, since I haven't knowingly
hit one in several months.. :)
2.7 timeframe - are there any added features of a P4 core we would *like*
to exploit that aren't on a P4M?
