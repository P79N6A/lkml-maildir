I'll say the obvious...
It either gets ENOMEM or it gets SIGKILL. If an essential daemon dies
when it gets ENOMEM then it's broken. You can in fact get ENOMEM
returned for some syscalls under the current scheme if you're very
lucky. Either way a broken program will die, but at least you can patch
it to handle ENOMEM.
There really are a lot of cases where this behavior would be beneficial,
and there are too many people brushing aside the whole idea, often with
strong words. A good example is any embedded system (you can see where
I'm coming from here) where every running process is tailored. Not that
I'm implying this should be made the default scheme.
