Yes, this message comes from the BIOS after the machine has rebooted.  I'm
going to find and run memtest86; but one thing I forgot to mention is that
we fell back to a UP kernel and it ran like a champ for weeks.  No SMP
kernel has gone more than about 2-3 days, sometimes much less (a few
hours).  I'll also dig up Doug's mem testing script and try that.

certainly cause problems ;-)
