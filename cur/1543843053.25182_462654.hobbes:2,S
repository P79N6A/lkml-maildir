I don't understand how a signal can come from a child pid namespace ?

yes, that's the purpose of pid_nr() I guess.
This list would contain in nearly all cases a single pair (current pid
namespace, pid value). It will contain 2 pairs for a task that has unshared
its pid namespace : a pair for the current pid namespace, that needs to
allocated when unshare() is called, and one pair for the ancestor pid
namespace which is already allocated.
Do you see more ?
