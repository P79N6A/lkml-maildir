Chuck got about as far through this as I did.  Yes, I'm suspecting an
earlier uncaught error of some form.  The videodev changes since 2.6.17 are
small and look to be unrelated.  I'd be suspecting preexisting videodev
bugs which have been exposed by sysfs/driver-model changes.  But it's very
hard to tell.
Going through and adding 1000 missing check-error-then-recover instances is
the ideal approach, but I suspect that leaving callers as-is and blurting a
message from the driver core when some of these things fail might get us
what we need.  But right now we have neither, and we see the result.
