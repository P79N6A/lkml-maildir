There are definitely plans to do this, and in fact on IA64 ACPI is already
used to obtain PCI routing. However, IA32 ACPI efforts have been focused on
other things, since we assumed MPS tables would be around for a while
longer. I guess that is no longer a correct assumption.
So yes, there are plans. ;-)
