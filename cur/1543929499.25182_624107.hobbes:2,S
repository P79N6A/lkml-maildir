the return of ENOTTY is to say "changing of freq isnt supported", not
that the value is invalid.  but i can get the same behavior by
deleting the function as the rtc-dev layer will take care of returning
ENOTTY.
so the behavior is for the RTC_IRQP_SET ioctl:
 - return ENOTTY if you cannot change freq
   - the rtc-dev layer will do this for you if you do not set irq_set_freq
 - return EINVAL if the requested freq is not within the capabilities
of the hardware
sound about right ?
