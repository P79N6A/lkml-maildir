look at dmesg and add an
	alias binfmt-xxxx off
to /etc/modules.conf so similar problems get caught properly - unless 
you want to actually use an emulator for this architecture of course :)
This is one of the cases where I wish kmod would do something more 
intelligent by default than endless loop. Would it be a good idea 
to attempt loading of emulator modules only for formats that are 
previously somehow registered + a few well known like aout,misc,elf?
Looking at exec.c, why isn't the result of request_module() tested?
