That's easy: mount -o lpio=0xXXX /dummy /mnt/rio
Your filesystem will see the mount options as a string, which you can parse in
any way you like.  BTW, can you not use the standard printer port driver?

There's a thread on linux-kernel about this right now.  See "schedule_timeout()
semantics/usage?".  A quick summary:

This restricts you to HZ resolution (often 100Hz, 10ms), which may be too
coarse for you.
