the problem is that unless you tecompile the kernel to add timing delays,
you cannot change the timing like this (if you put the tests in all your
fast paths to add delays you have just destroyed your performance in the
case where the hardware is good)
also you don't know the hardware is really working properly under windows,
how do you know if the blue screen was caused by a windows bug or a
hardware error.
