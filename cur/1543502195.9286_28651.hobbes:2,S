The example given (which I clipped; I should have left it) was an icon,
which is indeed stored in an EA on OS/2. That's the sort of thing that
has no business being stored with the file on Unix (including Linux).
NB:  OS/2 will also get an icon for an executable file from a .ICO file
with the same root-name in the same directory.  That one would work
fairly well on Linux.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
