Hello folks:  I am having some trouble getting a device driver to work
correctly now that I've made some changes to my interface to it.
I used to call the driver directly from whereever I wanted to one of its
functions.  In preparation of supporting other drivers I rewrote the
interface to use the standard open() and write().  If I am in kernel
space only it seems to work fine.  The problem comes when I try to
call it from (I think) user space.  I qualified my comment there
because I am beginning to believe there is confusion in my head about
kernel/user spaces.  Ok, OK, I know there's confusion!
I have been using the set_fs(get_ds()) macros to reset the address
limit back to kernel space.  This appears to work for a very short
period but then which ever process is currently running will lock up.
If it happens during the boot sequence the entire system is gone; if
it happens once the system is up, then whatever process is running
locks.  I suspect it is a problem with switching back and forth
between kernel and user space but I don't know why.
If anyone has any suggestions, I would certainly appreciate the help.
I am currently playing with 2.2.3.
Thank you for any help you might len.
  Kirk
