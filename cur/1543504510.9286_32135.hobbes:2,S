   Anyway, the pre-4 thing looks ok, although I don't seem to find the
   network byte order problem which we fixed in 2.3.x and that caused
   ECONNRESET problems under load. Davem? Was that a bug that only
   existed in 2.3.x in the first place?
There are a few other fixes that need to go into 2.2.x pre-4, I need
to synchronize with Alan, thats all.
Later,
