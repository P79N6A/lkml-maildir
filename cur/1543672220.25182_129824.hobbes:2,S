|                  kfree(m->buf);
|                  m->buf = kmalloc(m->size <<= 1, GFP_KERNEL);
|                  if (!m->buf)
|                          goto Enomem;
|          }

| What seems to happen is that the partition information does not fit in 
| m-buf, so 2x the amount of memory is allocated.  However, "count" 
| doesn't seem to be reset, so really, there is still only one page to 
| use instead of two (count points to the end of the first page).  Again 
| we malloc more space - this time 4 pages worth.  Count is still not 
| reset, but now we have 2 pages worth of space to use and the operations 
| succeed.  When the buffer is copied to user space, we have a whole 
| bunch of garbage, followed by the correct information.
| 
| On the surface, it would appear that the right thing to do is set 
| "count" to zero at the end of the while loop.

Correct patch is already in 2.4.21-rc1 (and likely before -rc1).
