Hello,
I register a callback function with dev_add_pack() this way:
  memset (&proto, 0, sizeof proto);
  proto.type = htons (ETH_P_ALL);
  proto.func = my_callback_function;
  dev_add_pack (&proto);
my_callback_function() receives all packets with local src/dst IP (including
SNATed ones) as well as all incoming ones, but forwarded outgoing packets are 
not passed to my_callback_function(). Looks like AF_PACKET sockets also rely 
on dev_add_pack(), yet of course tcpdump (correctly) shows all the packets. 
How should I register a callback with dev_add_pack() so that the callback
receives all the packets ?
Save yourself,
Nergal
