Numbers talk, theory spinning walks
Both Andrew and I did latency numbers for even small depths of tagging,
and the result was not pretty. Sure this is just your regular plaino
SCSI drives, however that's also what I care most about. People with
big-ass hardware tend to find a way to tweak them as well, I'd like the
typical systems to run fine out of the box though.
