I toyed with the idea of making it one way to convert tasks to SCHED_IDLEPRIO 
but not back to SCHED_NORMAL much like we do for niceing tasks up but not 
back down again. However I personally found this very inconvenient as I often 
might run something idleprio for a while and then change it back. It seems a 
fair thing for a normal user to do.

Obviously when they wrote the linux client and added the ability to set the 
priority from within the program to nice 19 they also explicitly set the 
scheduling policy at the same time. This might make sense on some other OS... 
but not linux.
