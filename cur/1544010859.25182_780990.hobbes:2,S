The order of your patches is reversed, you add the Kconfig/Makefile
changes last so that the tree stays 'bisectable', i.e. you don't
have a broken build in the middle between your patches.
Since your header file is not an interface but only used in a single
source file, I would also suggest merging it into the main via-sdmmc.c
file, add changing Kconfig/Makefile in the same patch.
