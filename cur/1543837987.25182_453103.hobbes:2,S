I'm almost sorry I threw that code out, you'd understand instantly..
Lemme see what I can do to explain; what I need/want is:
 - single allocation group per packet - that is, when I free a packet
and all its associated object I get my memory back.
 - not waste too much space managing the various objects
skb operations want to allocate various sk_buffs for the same data
clones. Also, it wants to be able to break the COW or realloc the data.
The trivial approach would be one page (or higher alloc page) per
object, and that will work quite well, except that it'll waste a _lot_
of memory. 
So I tried manual packing (parts of that you have seen in previous
attempts). This gets hard when you want to do unlimited clones and COW
breaks. To do either you need to go link several pages.
So needing a list of pages and wanting packing gave me SROG. The biggest
wart is having to deal with higher order pages. Explicitly coding in
knowledge of the object you're packing just makes the code bigger - such
is the power of abstraction.
