SunRPC is not then a suitable analogy.  There is no socket interface that
provides SunRPC as far as I know, so your example is invalid.  Yes, SunRPC is
built on top of something else, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_STREAM or whatever, but that's
like saying TCP is a datagram service rather than a stream service because it's
built on a datagram service (IP).  What a protocol uses out the back is pretty
much irrelevant - what is relevant is what the protocol in question actually
appears to provide to anyone using it.

No, it's not.  SOCK_DGRAM is an unreliable, unidirectional datagram passing
service.
