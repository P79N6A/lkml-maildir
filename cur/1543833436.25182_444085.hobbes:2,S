Yup, I did an ARRAY_SIZE pass a while ago, but I missed that somehow,
and some grepping shows there are a bunch more.

Yes, it's this bit in mmzone.h:
    #ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM
	/*
	 * A memory area that is only addressable by the kernel through
	 * mapping portions into its own address space. This is for example
	 * used by i386 to allow the kernel to address the memory beyond
	 * 900MB. The kernel will set up special mappings (page
	 * table entries on i386) for each page that the kernel needs to
	 * access.
	 */
	ZONE_HIGHMEM,
    #endif
