You may remove SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM from disk interrupts on the same grounds,
because flash-based "IDE" drives have no seek. Indeed, with careful
choice of components, setup, and placement of sniffing equipment
you may construct a case where you can predict interrupt times.
But it's too artificial to matter in real life.
Come on, let's get real. A few low bits of TSC are random enough
(for just about any interrupt source).
Attackers will probably look for easier ways to hack your crypto
than predicting /dev/random.
