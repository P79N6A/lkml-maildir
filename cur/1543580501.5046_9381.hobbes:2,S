Sure the box is really dead?  These very cheap cards with just the bt848
and nothing else often have a non-working i2c bus (because they have no
chips connected to it, maybe even the i2c pins unconnected).  The
i2c initialization takes forever (minutes) on these boards due to timeouts
and retries of the i2c code unless you tell the i2c layer it should make
some sanity checks on the i2c bus first (options i2c-algo-bit bit_test=1).
