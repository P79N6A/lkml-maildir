The Linux Kernel GCOV patch has been updated for 2.4.20 and 2.5.70.  The
patches can be downloaded from:
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3382
Major changes in this release:
* ppc32 support - Many thanks to Nigel Hinds, Paul Mackerras, and
everyone else who worked on this.
* The gcov-proc module is no longer external, it can now be build with
CONFIG_GCOV_PROC turned on.  So, the tarball is no longer needed, just
the patch now.
For more information about this patch, please see:

Thanks,
Paul Larson
