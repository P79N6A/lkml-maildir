Hi, Ed.  Your press release is looking good.  Here are some changes I
suggest for it (except I probably converted some tabs to spaces
unintentionally).

 BACKGROUND
 
-Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users.
-It interoperates well with a wide variety of other systems.
-Linux can take advantage of modern PC and PowerMac hardware
-or give new life to older 386 and 486 based computers. Several other
-processors, including the 64-bit Alpha and UltraSPARC are also
-supported.Support contracts are available from vendors and due to the open
-source nature of Linux to numerous third party organisations. Linux is
-provided under an unlimited use license that lets users make in-house
-customizations to the system itself. Latest estimates suggest that Linux has
-up to 20 million users worldwide.

 [COMMENT - This next bit is a new section. I think that it should be placed
 here, but I am not too firm on its revelance. It can't hurt to mention what
 these projects are. Gee, it'd be nice if the 2.2 release could coincide with
 the GNOME 1.0 release (hint hint, nudge nudge :-)]
 
-Projects such as GNOME (GNU Network Orientated Model Environment), KDE (K
-Desktop Environment) and Enlightenment allow users to completely customize
-their Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing quick and easy interaction with
-hardware and software through desktop icons, menus, and keyboard shortcuts. As
-an alternative, users can chose the window manager fvwm95, which is ready made
-to simulate the look and feel of recent releases of Microsoft Windows.
-
-
-One satisfied user, Scott Hamm, said that "Linux is technically far superior
-to any OS created across the earth. It is a robust operating system built to
-be a reliable server. Bottom of the line, Linux is the future."
-
-Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive examination of Linux
-issued by Microsoft Corporation, wrote that "Linux represents a best-of-
-breed UNIX, that is trusted in mission critical applications, and - due to
-it's open source code - has a long term credibility which exceeds many
-other competitive OS's."
+Thanks to projects such as GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment),
+KDE (K Desktop Environment) and Enlightenment, users who wish to use a

+easy interaction with hardware and software through desktop icons, menus,

+environments such as Microsoft Windows, NEXTSTEP, Amiga Workbench, or

+"We've been looking at Linux seriously for 18-24 months," said Sean
+Moloney of Intel Corporation in an interview with CNET. 
+
+"I'm no longer nervous talking to enterprise customers about Linux,"  John
+Paul, Senior Vice President at Netscape Communications told Wired. 
+
+In an internal analysis of Linux conducted at the Microsoft Corporation,
+engineer Vinod Valloppillil wrote: 
+
+	"Linux represents a best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted in
+	mission critical applications, and - due to [its] open
+	source code - has a long term credibility..."
+
+	"The latest generation Xfree86 + CDE was slick and definitely
+	represented among the best-of-breed in UNIX GUI's. A [Sun]
+	desktop user would be perfectly at home here. An advanced
+	Win32 GUI user would have a short learning cycle to become
+	productive."
+
+	"I was in a position where I could write up my changes and
+	email them out within a couple of hours (in contrast to how
+	things like this would get done in NT)."
+
+	"...as a server, Linux's modular architecture allows...
+	extreme performance in a particular service."
