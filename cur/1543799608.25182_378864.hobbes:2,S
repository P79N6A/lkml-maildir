Hello.
I'm pleased to announce new release of asynchronous crypto layer for
linux kernel 2.6.
Small changelog:
* Removed crypto load balancer thread.
* Eliminated main_crypto_dev.
* Removed unused session states.
* Simplified locking and reference counting.
* Simplified load balancing schema.
* Simple load balancer is part of acrypto module now.
* Added direct completion mode. If session's
  callback can be invoked in any context or
  if crypto provider can call   complete_session() from process context,
  one can set SESSION_DIRECT in session flags which will lead to callback
  invocation directly from  complete_session(), but not from workqueue.
* Here are dm-crypt port changes:
	o Reduced memory usage.
	o Use memory pools.
	o Removed several race conditions.
	o Code simplification.
