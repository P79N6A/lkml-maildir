We have to take a mod of the chunk value and the number of stripes (which can 
be a non-power-of-2, so a shift won't work). It's been my understanding that 
you couldn't mod a 64-bit value with a 32-bit value in the kernel. Just to be 
sure, I've changed "chunk" to a sector_t and recompiled, and get the 
following error:
