Hello,
you have been waiting long for exciting news, but there are none. Any
way I released a maintenance release for PPSkit that fixes all known
problems. Specifically the PPS API is the old one, and the supported
ntpd is 4.0.92h (4.0.93 and 4.0.93a failed to work. I don't have newer
sources at home).
So what is PPSkit?

(RFC1589)
                against Linux 2.2.11 (kernel patch, documentation, test
                programs).  Implements nanoseconds as resolution.
Keywords:       NTP, PPS, PPS API, kernel, RFC1305, RFC1589, xntp, time,

And what is new?
                            NEWS for 0.7.1
+ Merged changes for Linux-2.2.11 and tested with proven configuration
  (PPSkit-0.7.0 performed quite well).  Modified ``adjtimex()'' in
  kernel to clamp invalid values instead of rejecting them.  This is
  because ``ntpd'' does not care much about failing system calls, and
  after very long thought I think avoiding the ``Ariane V'' failure
  would not be bad.
+ Added a note about compilation problems and ``<sys/timex.h>'' (see
  file ``BUGS'').  Added a not about system include files and symbolic
  links for glibc-2.1 in ``INSTALL''.
+ Updated ``enable_pps.c'' to compile with glibc-2.1 (glibc-2.1 uses
  an ugly forward declaration of ``struct timeval'').  Added version
  of C library to compiled binary.
+ Fixed patch for ``ntpd/refclock.c'' to return success if PPS API was
  set up correctly (Stupid bug found by David Schwartz).
Specific wish: people running nin-i386 architectures, please
contribute to the project!
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
