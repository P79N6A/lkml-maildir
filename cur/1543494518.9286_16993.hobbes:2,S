Er... don't forget that for a last lotsa years he's been working with 
plan9.
Plan9 solves a lot of problems (relating to security, user and
machine interfaces and multiprocessing) that aren't solved in linux
2.2.
If you think he's comparing linux to NT or VMS or original unix then
yeah, I can see where you'd think he's off his rocker.
