Subject: [PATCH 0/3] core: fix build error when referencing arch specific structures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Since the core kernel routines need to reference cpu_sibling_map,
whether it be a static array or a per_cpu data variable, an access
function has been defined.
In addition, changes have been made to the ia64 and ppc64 arch's to
move the cpu_sibling_map from a static cpumask_t array [NR_CPUS] to
be per_cpu cpumask_t arrays.
Note that I do not have the ability to build or test patch 3/3, the
ppc64 changes.
Patches are referenced against 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 .
