It works in the various PCI drivers in drivers/net/* ...   I debug 
modules all the time by repeatedly loading and unloading them.
Make sure to check that you are using SET_MODULE_OWNER immediately 
following your alloc_etherdev() call.  It sounds like you might have 
messed-up module counts.  Also "cat /proc/modules" to check the module 
reference count correctness.
