Err find_first_bit ?
I guess that will work but your hand-coded version is so much faster :)
I would need to abstract sched_find_first_bit into a generic function
that also accepted a size argument.  Something like:
Rename sched_find_first_bit to _sched_find_first_bit, and
#if MAX_RT_PRIO < 120 && MAX_RT_PRIO > 99
#define sched_find_first_bit(b, size)	_sched_find_first_bit(b)
#else
#define sched_find_first_bit(b, size)	find_first_bit(b, size)
#endif
We can let MAX_RT_PRIO go up 120 since the bitmap is actually 160, not
140, size 5*32=160.
Look good?
