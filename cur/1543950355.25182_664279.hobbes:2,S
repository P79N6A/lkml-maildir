It's not a matter of whether it's a PCI thing or a NUMA thing. The name
of the attribute needs to reflect the semantics of what the driver
perceives, along the entire path from the device including PCI and NUMA
and other bits.
How the attribute is implemented is up to the arch code, it can decide
if it sets attributes on the PHB or the device or in the NUMA
interconnect or whatever.
For a single mapping, it's fairly straight forward to define two obvious
cases:
 - strict ordering, all accesses to this mapping are ordered.
 - weak ordering (none, relaxed ..) - accesses to this mapping are not 
   ordered in anyway.
Where I think it gets confusing is the semantics between mappings with
different attributes. If I map region A weak and then region B strict,
does an access to region B have any effect on accesses to region A?
It sounds like in your case the answer is yes - but I don't know if
that's clearly the right answer.
/me scratches his head :)
cheers
