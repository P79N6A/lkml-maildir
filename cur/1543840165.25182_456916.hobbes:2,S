This function is called in the process of authorizing the current
process to do something which would remove its right to write to the
given file. So it hasn't done anything at the lower integrity level yet
and therefore if a write gets through it can't possibly be of low
integrity data.
Example: The current process is running at the USER level and writing to
a USER file in /home/user/.  The process then attempts to read an
UNTRUSTED file.  The current process will become UNTRUSTED and the read
allowed to proceed but first write access to all USER files is revoked
including the ones it has open.
