LKML,
TRG got a response from Novell related to the NetWare File System
on Linux.  From the tone of the letter, Novell is declaring war 
on Linux or anyone who is using NWFS.  This letter is posted 
to our website and can be accessed at www.timpanogas.org if 
any NWFS users want to know what Novell's views are and public 
statements.  They claim it's "stolen property".
