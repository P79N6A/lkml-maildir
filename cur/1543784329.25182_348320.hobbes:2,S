Guys, stop being stupid about things. I already sent rmk an email in 
private. And Alan, there's absolutely no point in making things even 
worse.
Mistakes happen, and the way you fix them is not to pull a tantrum, but 
tell people that they are idiots and they broke something, and get them to 
fix it instead.
You don't have to be polite about it, and swearing is fine. So instead of
saying "I don't want to play any more because Davem made a mistake", say
something like "Davem is a f*cking clueless moron, here's what he did and
here's why it's wrong".
Notice? In both cases you get to vent your unhappiness. In the second
case, you make the person who made a mistake look bad. But in the first
case, it's just yourself that looks bad.
