I was hoping for a little more explanation on that before I used it... 
for example, will the following code generate a warning? An error?
void func_b(void *b) { }
void func_a(__user void *a)
{
	func_b(a);
}
How about the other way, passing a normal pointer to a function with 
__user in its prototype?
I'm just worried that as soon as I use __user once, entire call chains 
are going to start spewing warnings/errors.

I was under the impression that text/plain attachments were ok with 
you, but it looks like inline will work too.
