Hi Bill,
You asked for something interesting to do to make Linux kernel perfect.
How about fixing loopback driver? The last time I tried (many hours ago
but probably it was still 2.3.50, can't remember) it was corrupting the
underlying filesystem badly on any attempt to do any write io.
Sound like an interesting project...
Regards,
