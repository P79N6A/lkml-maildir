I think there is a fundamental issue that raid5 want to deal in 4k
sized requests and bios can be much bigger than this.  So there needs
to be a clean mechanism to dice up a bio into little bits (without
blocking on memory allocation at the wrong time) and to give them to
raid5.  A similar dicing up is needed for raid0, which would want chunk
sized bits, and linear, which would sometimes want to cut a bio in
half and some particular point.
It's on my list of things to worry about but I just haven't had a
chance yet.
