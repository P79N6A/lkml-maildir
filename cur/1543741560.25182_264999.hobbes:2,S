The issue is that Linus _has_ changed the development model.  What we have
now is more flexable and much more responsive to changes.  This does 
lead to stable releases that are not quite a stable as some of the previous
stable series...  This is why I suggest a fix/security branch.  The idea being
that after a month or so of fixes etc it will be a very stable kernel and it will
not have slowed down development.
