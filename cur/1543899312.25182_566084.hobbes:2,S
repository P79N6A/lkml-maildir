I'm not getting this:
You'll only start looking into an analysis tool if you have a 
performance problem, IOW if you are not satisfied with the performance.
And the debug code will not have been tested on this machine no matter 
whether it's enabled through a compile option or at runtime.

If you might be able to get a big part of tracing and other debug code 
enabled with a performance penalty of a few percent of _kernel_ 
performance, then you might get much debugging aid without any effective 
impact on application performance.
You always have to decide between some debug code and some small bit of 
performance. There's a reason why options to disable things like BUG() 
or printk() are in the kernel config menus hidden behind CONFIG_EMBEDDED
although they obviously have some performance impact.
