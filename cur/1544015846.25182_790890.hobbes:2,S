It's not quirky, it's structured.  Until and unless there is a better,
structured interface, this needs to stay.

Yes 32 is small, but not really a big problem in practice.  The MCE daemon
(
http://mcedaemon.googlecode.com
) goes a long way towards making this
a non-issue.  Every distro should ship mced.

This is not true, we do EXTENSIVE post-processing of MCEs.  Yes it is hard
to extend, but that's not the same as saying it is useless.

Not true.  The vast vast vast majority of MCEs are corrected, as per our
experience, and I suspect we've got more experience with MCEs than just
about any other consumer.

NO!  This moves in the completely wrong direction.  This output is just
about impossible to parse sanely.  And don't get me started about how much
of a pain it is to encode all of the vendor-centric and per-platform
specifics so that it decodes all the useful bits.
I promise you that there are things that are useful to us that the kernel
will not parse and print.

I disagree totally.  Putting the logic for decoding MCEs into the kernel
adds a large amount of complex, hard to maintain code precisely where it
is most destructive.  Any sort of decoding of this data in-kernel is
probably a mistake (yes, I am looking at you EDAC).
It would be much cleaner to instead make the kernel really good at
publishing errors and let userspace decode them.  A naive end user won't
know the difference - they will see a message on the syslog or the
console.  Power users will be able to do better things.

I would be fine with this (though I disagree that it *must* be ASCII).  I
don't care how the raw data comes out of the kernel, just that it is the
raw data, not some half-assedly parsed data.

I agree 1000% with this - it is something I have wanted for a long time,
and that some of my team are starting to look at again.

Don't dicard the past until the present can stand on it's own.  Please.

Please leave /dev/mcelog as a CONFIG option until such time as an
appropriate replacement is *done*.  We rely on it.
