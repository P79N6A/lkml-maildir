IMO, their needs to be statistical code in the mutex itself so that it can
measure the frequency of PI events as well as depth of the inheritance
chains and all data structure traversals. The problem with writing that
stuff now is that there isn't proper priority propagation through the entire
dependency chain in any mutex code that I've publically seen yet. Patching
this instrumentation in a mutex require a mutex with this built in
functionality. IMO, PI should be considered a kind of contention overload
condition and really a kind of fallback device to deal with these kind
of exceptional circumstances.
Turning this into a "priority inheritance world" is just going to turn
this project into the FreeBSD SMP project where nobody is working on fixing
the actual contention problems in the kernel and everybody is dependent on
overloading an already half-overloaded scheduler with priority calculations.
This eventually leads the kernel doing little effective work and is the main
technical reason why DragonFly BSD exists, a vastly superior BSD development
group (for many reasons).

IMO, is a pretty fair assessment some of the failures of using a "late" PI.
It's not the whole story, but a pretty solid view of how it's been misunderstood,
overused and then flat out abused. There might be places where, if algorithmically
bounded somehow, reverting some of the heavy hammered sleeping locks back to
spinlocks would make the system faster and more controlled. rtc_lock possibly
could be one of those places and other places that are as heavily as used as
that.
That's my take on it.
