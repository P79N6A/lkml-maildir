I use only ext3, the disc system is working fine AFAIK. 2.6.7-bk10 has the
same problem, 2.6.7-bk2 completes the test case, but it takes 50-70s, and
the system is completely frozen until the program finishes.

swappiness is set to 60.
However, I realized that I had set /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode to 1. If I set
it to 0, 2.6.7-bk10 starts to work.
