Andy,
Yes you are correct about a memory leak being in fs/cifs/transport.c in 2.5
I have included the fix for this in version 0.6.3 of the CIFS VFS which is
being
tested now and will post the patch for version 0.6.3 to the project web
site
(
http://us1.samba.org/samba/Linux_CIFS_client.html
) later today.
Thanks for finding this.
