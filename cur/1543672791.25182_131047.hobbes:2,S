Out of personal interest - would a mechanism that promised the following 
be considered a "proper mechanism"?
1. Work on all platforms.
2. Allow load and unload in arbitrary order and timings (which also 
means "be race free").
3. Have low/zero overhead if not used
Would you also require:
4. Have reasonable overhead when used
a "must have" demand? Would, on the other hand, a:
4b. Have zero overhead when used for functions not hooked
be an alternative demand?
I'm currently trying to work with some other subscribers of this list on 
a design. Getting 1, 2 and 3 is a complicated enough task, of course. I 
would like to hear estimates about inclusion chances should we manage to 
come up with an implmentation that lives up to all the above.
             Thanks,
                Shachar
