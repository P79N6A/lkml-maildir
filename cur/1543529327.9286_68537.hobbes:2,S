This has suffered from slight lack of maintenance due to other work. I think
its roughly in order. Please submit updates
o	Note: this is meant to track general problems for now. Specific bugs
	as we move through 2.4 but not yet.
In Progress
-----------
Merge the network fixes  (DaveM)
Merge 2.2.13/14 changes  (Alan, all done barring COMX and Sk98)
Get RAID 0.90 in 	 (Ingo)
Fix Exists But Isnt Merged
--------------------------
Signals leak kernel memory (security)	[JJ has fixes]
msync fails on NFS			[Wrong return]
Semaphore races
Sempahore memory leak
Exploitable leak in file locking	[Lock limit needed]
To Do
-----
Restore O_SYNC functionality
Fix eth= command line
vmalloc(GFP_DMA) is needed for DMA drivers
VM needs rebalancing
Fix SPX socket code
put_user appears to be broken for i386 machines
Fix module remove race bug
Test other file systems on write
Directory race fix for UFS
Audit all char and block drivers to ensure they are safe with the 2.3
	locking - a lot of them are not especially on the open() path.
Stick lock_kernel() calls around driver with issues to hard to fix nicely
	for 2.4 itself
To Do But Non Showstopper
-------------------------
Make syncppp use new ppp code
Finish 64bit vfs merges (lockf64 and friends missing)
NCR5380 isnt smp safe
DMFE is not SMP safe
ACPI hangs on boot for some systems
Get the Emu10K merged
Finish I2O merge
Go through as 2.4pre kicks in and figure what we should mark obsolete for
	the final 2.4
Per Process rtsigio limit
Probably Post 2.4
-----------------
per super block write_super needs an async flag
addres_space needs a VM pressure/flush callback
per file_op rw_kiovec
enhanced disk statistics
To Check
--------
Truncate races (Debian apt shows it nicely) [done ?]
Elevator and block handling queue change errors are all sorted
Check O_APPEND atomicity bug fixing is complete
Incredibly slow loopback tcp bug
Finish softnet driver port over and cleanups
Page cache high on PAE36 boxes is very slow, maybe disable ?
Protection on isize  (sct)
Mikulas claims we need to fix the getblk/mark_buffer_uptodate thing for
	2.3.x as well
Fbcon races
Fix all remaining PCI code to use new resources and enable_Device
VFS?VM - mmap/write deadlock
initrd is bust
rw sempahores on page faults (mmap_sem)
kiobuf seperate lock functions/bounce/page_address fixes
Fix routing by fwmark
Some FB drivers check the A000 area and find it busy then bomb out
NTFS needs updating/binning or something
rw semaphores on inodes to fix read/truncate races ?
Not all device drivers are safe now the write inode lock isnt taken on write
File locking needs checking for races
Multiwrite IDE breaks on a disk error
AFFS doesn't work on current page cache
