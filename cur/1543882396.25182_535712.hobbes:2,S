Does the spec say what the OS should do if (ts_nsec => 1e9)?

This currently requires reading the current value with stat() and then use this value in the futimesat() call.  This is slow and might create even wrong results (the file could have been updated in the meantime).  If the tv_nsec value of either of the elements of the utimes parameter to utimensat() is UTIME_OMIT no update of that respective value is performed.
ITYM "If the value of either of the elements..."
+#define UTIME_NOW	((1l << 30) - 1l)
+#define UTIME_OMIT	((1l << 30) - 2l)
OK, so there's no collision on ts_nsec if unnormalised timespecs are
disallowed.
But there's a potential collision on ts_sec?  Do we know what date that
corresponds to?
> The second extension allows to set one of the values to the correct current time.  Today it is only possible to set both values at the same time.  Once again this is slower and might to lead to incorrect results.  The use of UTIME_NOW for the respective tv_nsec value implements this functionality.

In fact, I think one problem where the old code wouldn't recognize certain overflows (if tv_nsec * 1000 overflows).

Do you have a testcase app which can be used by arch maintainers?
