Hello.
I found that there are "current->pid", "task_pid_vnr(current)"
and "task_pid_nr(current)" cases in kernel 2.6.24 .
According to include/linux/pid.h ,
"task_pid_nr()" is global id and "task_xid_vnr()" is virtual id.
But what id does "current->pid" indicate?
Is "current->pid" equivalent to "task_pid_nr(current)" ?
Regards.
