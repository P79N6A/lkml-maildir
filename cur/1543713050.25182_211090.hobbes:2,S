Post reasonably small pieces of them.

Maybe. Maybe not. I am no expert, I'd try to learn out how SIGRT_1
is generated in normal case (I suppose kernel does not distinguish
between threads and processes, maybe it's done by threading libs?)

I won't argue. One thing is clear: not enough info at this time :(
Try to instrument (printk("...")) parts of kernel responsible for
handling exit() etc.
