I am completely convinced that the patch you are using (which I
believe is the same as the one Andrew calls
"tty-shutdown-race-fix.patch") is the problem.  What happens is that
release_dev() in tty_io.c calls cancel_delayed_work(), which calls
del_timer_sync() without decrementing nr_queued for keventd_wq.
When flush_scheduled_work() gets called it sleeps on the work_done
waitqueue.  The only place work_done gets woken up is in
run_workqueue, and it only happens if
atomic_dec_and_test(&cwq->nr_queued) decrements nr_queued to 0.
But after calling cancel_delayed_work(), that can never happen (we
deleted the timer that was going to add the work that we're waiting
for).
It seems to me that the implementation of cancel_delayed_work() is
not quite right.  We need to decrement nr_queued if we actually
stopped the work from being added to the workqueue.
Andrew, I've never seen a reply from you about this, can you tell me
if I'm missing something here?
By the way, I assume that the process below is the one that's hung:
    bash          D C04CDC68 4233453816  8524      1                8387 (L-TLB)
    Call Trace:

     [<c016dd7c>] __fput+0xac/0x100
     [<c0258170>] tty_release+0x0/0x1b0
It would seem to be stuck in the flush_workqueue() called from
release_dev(), just as I would expect.
Shawn, can you try the patch below instead of Andrew's ttyfix2?
