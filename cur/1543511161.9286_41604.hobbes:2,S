Subject: patch - arp responding overenthusastically?

ladies, gentlemen:
i'm posting this on behalf of a colleague here, dr. david robinson, to
whom replies should be directed.
the odd behaviour we've found is that when an arp request is received with
a target IP address of a local interface, the response contains the MAC
address of the receiving interface rather than the target interface.
the fix in this this patch ensures that arp responses for a local
interface are only replied to using that interface.  the patch is against
arp.c as it appeared in 2.2.11, btw.
david also adds that "It also provides a performance improvement;
currently ip_route_input() is called for every arp request on the network
where the target machine is not the local machine. With this patch,
routing is only tried if IP forwarding is enabled on the interface."
thanks to clayton weaver <cgweav@eskimo.com> for the pointer here.
