How do you think the kernel gets onto a new platform, without
cross-compiling features?  But, building outside the source tree has
nothing to do with portable Makefiles.

They are related in that we rely on GNU-isms in GNU tools throughout the
compiler.  GNU makefile'isms.  GNU gcc'isms.  GNU binutil'isms.
IMHO it is far more productive, and often easier, to port the GNU
toolchain to a new platform, than to make the kernel sources use a wider
array of _build tools_.

This is a red herring.  The parts of the kernel which need the most
optimization are generally hand-optimized anyway.  Recompiling POVray
with the Compaq Alpha compiler buys you alot.  I'll bet recompiling the
kernel with Compaq Alpha compiler would make it _slower_ due to the lack
of certain gcc'isms.

Oh come on.  This could apply for any number of situations with any
number of compilers.  Debugging is all about reducing variables, and the
compiler will always be one of those variables.

What are you talking about?  People build outside the source tree with
auto{conf,make} packages all the time.  Besides, that too is a red
herring.  I'm talking about an automake-like system for building
Makefiles.  automake-like, not automake.  Not autoconf.
And GNU automake is very actively maintained.  Check out the latest
version of CVS even.

Having a portable Makefile (the subject of this thread) has nothing to
do with building outside the kernel source tree.  It shouldn't be too
hard to set that sort of thing up, and that would definitely be useful
to the distribution makers (like MandrakeSoft :))
