Okay, Okay :)  To be exact, *I* have had build bustage of some kind in
every 2.4.0-test kernel, and BTTV has definitely been broken in test3 and
test4.  The patch fixes the brokenness.  This patch has to get applied one
way or another, because i2c_tuner_init just isn't implemented anywhere
anymore.
Best,
Jeffrey
