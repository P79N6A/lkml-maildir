this is usually done via the MMU which can do miracolous
things to memory and addresses ...

because it is usually designated as rom area, which naturally
is read only ...

basically a memory manager (depending on the processors 
capabilities) does either use memory mapping or simple
memory exchanging between designated regions and above
1M+64k memory ...
given an apropriate address mapping (via mmu) you should
be able to access the entire memory (not just the first
megabyte) without disturbing any memory mapped hardware ...
how could this be possible? simple there are 32 address
lines on a full 386 and above, which gives you 4GB of
physical memory addresses, now the memory mapped hardware
(pci,agp, but also isa) is only activated if the address
lies within a defined range. memory can be designated to
a different range, like (ep)roms ...
for example the Intel 386EX allows to define signals for
each configured memory range (chip selects) to enable or
disable the devices (memory) on demand, other systems
use some chipset/onboard logic to do this ...
