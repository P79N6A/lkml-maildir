Yes. The interrupt status, above, clearly shows that the XT-PIC is
being used for timer interrupts. The local APIC timer is being used
instead of the PIT (Programmable Interval Timer at port 0x40,
channel 0).  The IO-APIC contains, several timers as well as a
programmable interrupt controller and router, etc. You are not
using its interrupt controller, but you are using its timer,
best I can see.

Once you enable some other path to the CPUs INT line, you can
get some other condition. These paths may pick up different
noise or their logic returns may have different ground-bounce
conditions. Sometimes you can fix glitches like this by:
(1)	Putting a metal post and a screw in every mounting
	hole in your motherboard.... OR.
(2)	Using only 1 or 2 metal posts to mount your motherboard
	and using plastic insulators for the other holes.
