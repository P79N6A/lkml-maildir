According to me the right thing would be to alloc all the memory without
using GFP. Please take a look at:
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.10_andrea-VM6.gz
I also rewrote from scratch the buffer dynamic allocation. With my code
you can choose at compile time (not a config option but a #define in
buffer.c) the number of buffers you want to take hashed in the same bucket
supposing the hashfn is perfect and all the memory is alloced in buffers.
