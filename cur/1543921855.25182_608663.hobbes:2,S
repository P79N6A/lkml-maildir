earlier gcc versions had problems with -mregparm and with -pg. I just 
did a quick test with latest gcc and at a quick glance it seems to work 
better - i'll propagate that throught he whole latency tracer to see 
whether it's indeed working throughout. Anyway, this means that there's 
no urgent need for this patch and we've dropped it from the x86 queue 
for now. As long as it only affects older gcc's it's probably not worth 
force-keeping the annotations for that purpose alone.
