Well, it's hard to say whether "lots" have this issue, but the ones I 
have in my machine, Seagate 7200.7 NCQ 160GB (ST3160827AS) and 7200.10 
320GB (ST3320620AS), both support NCQ and don't support non-NCQ FUA, and 
those (especially the latter) seem to be very popular models.
Likely Seagate didn't implement that command since they figured nobody 
would use that if they had NCQ..
