I still suspect moving order0 allocations to slab will be a fragmentation
resistent allocator but my main concern would be that the slab allocator
overhead, both CPU and storage requirements will be too high.
On the other hand, it would do some things you are looking for. For
example, it allocates large blocks of memory in one lump and then
allocates them piecemeal. Second, it would be resistent to the FAFAFA
problem Martin pointed out. As slabs would be allocated in a large block
from the buddy, you are guarenteed that you'll be able to free up buddies.
Lastly, as there would be a cache specifically for userspace pages, a
defragger that looked exclusively at user pages will still be sure of
being able to free adjacent buddies.
I need to write a proper RFC.....
