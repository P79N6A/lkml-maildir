Dear, 
I'm using Redhat linux 7.0 on an HP vectra vei8-Piii450 computer. My
desktop environment is Gnome 1.2.1.
This noon I found that the date went four times faster! It was going well
before about 11 PM Wen May 30. But after that the date
displayed by commod "date" accelerated. It told me Thu May 31 00:54:52 CST
2001 while my watch was Wen May 30 17:40. 
Also the "clock" applet on the Panel of Gnome told me 12:57 AM Thu May 31!
Thanks for help!
Timothy
