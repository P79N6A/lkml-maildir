Clearly that compiler is different from mine.  On my machine the "ret"  
opcode is at offset 0x16, not 0x1d.  Also, I guess the display of the code
bytes in stack dumps got changed at some point; now it shows values both
before and after the EIP location (it used to show just the values after
EIP).  Okay, that clears that up.
The oops occurring where it did means that hcd->driver->hcd_free is not a
valid function pointer, even though hcd->driver appears to point to actual
data.  So it's not a data access through a null pointer; it's a call to an
unmapped (possibly null) location.
It's not at all clear how that could happen.  Those pointers are located
in static data in the HCD modules.  It doesn't seem likely that the
pointer was overwritten.  The only other possibility I can think of is
that the module was already unloaded.  But that's not possible since you
were holding a reference to a device on that bus.
Maybe the answer is that hcd->driver is messed up but for some reason 
still points to actual data.  I can't imagine why that would happen 
either.
