I don't get you.  Isn't that already what the text says?

OK.

I do that often.  It's useful information.  If person X sends an fbdev
patch and Tony says "whoa, neat" and I send the patch to Linus then Linus could
well think "wtf, Andrew doesn't know anything about fbdev".  So I do s/whoa
neat/Acked-by:/ to tell the world that someone who knows something has
looked at the change.

yeah, well, what isn't ;)
The person whose Acked-by: I added will get a copy of the added-to-mm email
so if they didn't want that acked-by added then they get a chance to remove
it again.

Explain what we use Acked-by: for, and how it differs from Signed-off-by:
Acked-by: Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>

+Acked-by: is often used by the maintainer of the affected code when that
+maintainer neither contributed to nor forwarded the patch themselves.
+
+Acked-by: is not as formal as Signed-off-by:.  It is a record that the acker
+has at least reviewed the patch and has indicated acceptance.  Hence patch
+mergers will sometimes manually covert an acker's "yep, looks good to me" into
+an Acked-by:.
+
+Acked-by: does not necessarily indicate acknowledgement of the entire patch. 
+For example, if a patch affects multiple subsystems and has an Acked-by: from
+one subsystem maintainer then this usually indicates acknowledgement of just
+the part which affects that maintainer's code.  Judgement should be used here.
