I am taking about southbridges with random sources, not about soundchips :)
They can be used to contribute some bits to the entropy pool. I dont think
they are the only source one should trust. But the specs say that they are
no PNRG, and I havent heared about too disasterous results from statistical
tests. So they are better than ethernet drivers, anyway.
