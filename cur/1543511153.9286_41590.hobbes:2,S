i've found that ripping cd's on my machine from ide (sony cd) -> scsi
(AHA274x/284x/294x, western digital UW drive) occasionally causes the machine
to hard lock. ripping from the ide cdrom to an ide drive does not run into this
problem. additionally running 2.3.18ac8 + smp-h3 does funky things to the sound
output, it soulds like it is at half speed. i'm currently not able to debug the
former since i'm not sure how to use the sys-request key under a hard lock
while running xwindows (no serial console). i'm more than willing to give
additional patches/whathaveyou a try to see what happens.
the machine is a dual cpu celeron with an asus p2b-ds motherboard.
