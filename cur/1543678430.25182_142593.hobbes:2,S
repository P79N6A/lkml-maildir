No. Never really used acpi under 2.4.x cos it all seemed like a bit mess
to me and the couple of times I tried it it just didn't do much of anything.
apm worked so I stuck with it. When I moved to 2.5.x I decided to test-run
as much as possible and so started using acpi.
As a note: at least the screen displayed and the requirements from the 
bios are both thesame when apm and acpi are used.

I had that in my original testing. It hung. I'll try again and tell
you where.

Haven't tried s3. Will do so asap.

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
