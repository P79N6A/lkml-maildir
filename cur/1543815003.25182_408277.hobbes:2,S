Why, I was proposing looking at dst cache. If that's NULL, well,
we won't stretch ACKs. Worst case we apply the wrong optimization.
Right?

Okay, I get that.
What I'd like to clarify, however: rfc2581 explicitly states that in some cases
it might be OK to generate ACKs less frequently than every second full-sized
segment. Given Matt's measurements, TCP on top of IP over InfiniBand on Linux
seems to hit one of these cases.  Do you agree to that?
