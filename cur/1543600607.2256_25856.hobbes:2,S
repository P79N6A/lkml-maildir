Hi everyone,
I got a bug report of LOADLIN not working with recent -ac kernels, and 
thought it might have something to do with my recent A20 changes that 
were added to -ac.  However, in trying to reproduce this bug, I have 
been completely unable to boot *any* 2.4 kernel with LOADLIN-1.6, trying 
this from Win98 DOS mode.
Anyone have any insight into this?  I really don't understand how the 
A20 changes could affect LOADLIN, and it's starting to look to me that 
there is some other problem going on...
