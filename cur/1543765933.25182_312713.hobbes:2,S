Well what is the case if you use unmodified GPL code, do you still have
to provide sources to the end user if you give them binaries?  I would
guess yes, but IANAL.
As far as I can tell their system is a geode GX1 so runs standard x86
software.  Maybe they didn't have to modify any of the linux kernel to
run what they needed.  Their applications are their business of course.
It looks like they use QT as the gui toolkit, which I don't off hand
know the current license conditions of.  Then there is the web browser
and such, which has it's own license conditions.  Of course for all I
know their user manual has an offer of sending a CD with the sources if
you ask.  Does anyone actually have their product that could check for
that?
