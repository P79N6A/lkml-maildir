David,
It would be helpful, in my opinion, to print out some additionnal
information from the place the kernel detects the wrong access.
Basically, the problem could be due to some FS address (indirect pointer) 
taken from a corrupted block or the buffer header having been corrupted. 
The current messages display some arithmetic that involves both bh->b_size
and bh->b_rsector and no more.
The number of 512 bytes sectors in a block is (b_size>>9) and b_rsector is
calculated as b_blocknr*(b_size>>9).
So, the #sector beyond the last block we want is:
      (b_blocknr+1)*(b_size>>9).
The message display half this value (1K block scaled value), that, by the 
way, appears to me not being what we 'want' but just beyond what we
want. ;-)
It would interesting, in my opinion, to also print out the following
fields:
- bh->b_size
- bh->b_blocknr
- bh->b_rsector
Gérard.
