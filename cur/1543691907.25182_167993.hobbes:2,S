Several of the x86 "hardware assists" need some rather hefty hacks
codewise to cope with their concomitant data structure proliferations
under industrial workloads, and generally have me begging for RISC's
system-level features instead (which, of course, require various
undoings of Linux' x86 crossdressings to exploit).
Given the reactions in prior threads, this message clearly needs to
wait a long while before it will ever be heard.
