I guess the important difference is that IP masquerading only substitutes
bytes; it neither inserts nor deletes bytes.  Not to mention that you
can't mmap() a network stream.  It's not a good comparison to CRLF
conversion.  My vote is to kill that feature in 2.3 and retroactively
add a warning to 2.2.11.
