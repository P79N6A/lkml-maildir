Yes, I know ... the problem here is that it's not even clear what
should be considered to be an error, and "common sense" still
leaves a broad range of possibilities.
BTW, here's another threads problem (2.4.0-test7, glibc-2.1.3):
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>
static void *thread(void *dummy)
{
    _exit(0);
}
int main(void)
{
    pthread_t th;
    pthread_create(&th,NULL,&thread,NULL);
    while (1) {
	write(1,".",1);
	sleep(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
The _exit doesn't. Again, the description in POSIX.1 isn't as clear
as it could be (doesn't mention threads explicitly).
