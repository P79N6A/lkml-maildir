Nathan,
I agree your patch should be ok for the special case, but it's not
sufficient. Please note a Link device is just an abstraction of PCI
router, which possibly is in ICH. If we use pci=noacpi or acpi=noirq, we
don't use link device but still use the router and may also change the
sets of the router (look at i386/pci/irq.c) and so still fail after S3.
Your patch can't handle this situation. This indicates adding
suspend/resume code in pci_link.c is not a good idea. Generic solution
should be to provide LPC driver.
Thanks,
Shaohua
