This "read/write buffer" is managed by sysfs filesystem.
Sysfs is invoked via kernel VFS subsystem, when user calls read(2) or write(2).
In the read(2) case, sysfs_read_file() is invoked, allocates a page for buffer,
and calls the show() method to generate the containts of this pseudo file entry.
Therefore, show() and store() method does not need to manage this buffer.
When store() method is invoked with data from userspace, sysfs terminate it with
'\0' implicitly. The size of buffer is also limited to PAGE_SIZE implicitly.
Can you make it clear?
