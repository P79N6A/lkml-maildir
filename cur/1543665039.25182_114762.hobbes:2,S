Eric,
I have a patch set available for kexec for 2.5.64.  I haved checked it
on a 1-way system, the 2-way test is pending an fsck of a partition that
was unfortunately eaten earlier today.
The patches are available for download from OSDL's patch lifecycle
manager (PLM):
Patch Stack for kexec for 2.5.64:
        kexec base for 2.5.64 (based upon 2.5.63 version)

        kexec hwfixes for 2.5.64 (based upon 2.5.63 version)

        kexec usemm change (allowed 2-way to previously work for me):
        
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1658
        optional change to defconfig to CONFIG_KEXEC=y

The patches are also available (with matching kexec-tools-1.8 --
unchanged from the 2.5.63 version) here:
