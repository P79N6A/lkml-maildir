A K6-2 500 has become available for me to try, won't be able to test it
until Thursday night, but will definitely do that.

I reseated all the cards a few times during my initial testing, no
difference.  Also, when I tried the Cyrix CPUs, the only things that got
changed were the CPU and jumper settings, and it all worked fine.  The
case and components have never been dropped or damaged.
