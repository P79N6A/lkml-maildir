From my point, sorry for thread hijacking, but I did not have
the upper node anymore.
So, here is something that I think should go into the next 2.6.22.
A proper fix is already in 2.6.23-git-du-jour.
/home/build/rt.jengelh.10.2-i386/var/tmp/kernel-source-2.6.22.7-build
/usr/src/linux-2.6.22.7-13.1/drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:
In function ■ali_init_chipset■:
/home/build/rt.jengelh.10.2-i386/var/tmp/kernel-source-2.6.22.7-build
/usr/src/linux-2.6.22.7-13.1/drivers/ata/pata_ali.c:466:
warning: ■rev■ is used uninitialized in this function
Yes, it is indeed used uninitialized, and that is dangerous,
given that I do have a chipset that uses pata_ali.ko and
currently runs a 'broken' kernel...it has not exploded yet, though.
I could not backport and create a patch because struct pci_dev
does not have the ->revision field in 2.6.22 yet. Ideas?
