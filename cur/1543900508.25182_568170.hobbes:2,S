Subject: [PATCH] avoid OPEN_MAX in SCM_MAX_FD
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/11/661

The OPEN_MAX constant is an arbitrary number with no useful relation to
anything.  Nothing should be using it.  SCM_MAX_FD is just an arbitrary
constant and it should be clear that its value is chosen in net/scm.h
and not actually derived from anything else meaningful in the system.
