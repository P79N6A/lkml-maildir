Even if this works under good conditions, it will fail in many cases 
because the related software is not up to date with recent device formware bugs.
Cdrecord is kept up to date as it either deals with a new drive or not.
Delegating things to other instances only works ar long as there are clean ans 
stable interfaces. This unfortunately does not apply to CD/DVD/HD-DVD.

And guess why Sun is currently working on a work around this nautilus problem.
