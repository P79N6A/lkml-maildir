The server in question is running the tulip driver.  dmesg reports:
Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.13 (January 2, 2001)
I have seen this same behavior on a couple of my servers running 3com 
3c905c adaptors as well.
The last time I was experiencing it I rebooted the system and it didn't 
solve the problem.  When it came up it was still lagging.  This would lead 
me to believe that it is caused by some sort of network condition, but what 
I don't know.
If anyone has ideas, I'd be more than happy to run tests/provide more info..
