Strange.  Which of
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <ctype.h>
  #include <errno.h>
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <string.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
needed the "-I$(HPATH)"?
I suspect what you had was a dangling symlink "/usr/include/linux".  If
so, this is a bug in your /usr/include hierarchy, not in the kernel
source.  This is one good reason Linus and the glibc2 maintainers
believe in losing those symlinks.
