You misunderstood this. The restrictions are introduced by a "restricted 
fork", to which you specify the restrictions the mext process should 
have + those inherited from the parent. So if you execute an attachment 
from the thread that views the email, THIS should be restricted from 
e.g. addressbook and network.
Anyway, when you answer a message - in most cases you put the message in 
an "outbox", which the main thread of the mail program sends, when told 
to, and as the main thread is not restricted from the network 
(supprise!) it will succeed in sending the mails.
