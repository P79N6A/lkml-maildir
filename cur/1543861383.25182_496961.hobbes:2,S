I'd say "care about obvious, safe optimizations which we still not do".
I want this:
char v[4];
...
	memcmp(v, "abcd", 4) == 0
compile to single cmpl on i386. This (gcc 4.1.1) is ridiculous:
.LC0:
        .string "abcd"
        .text
...
        pushl   $4
        pushl   $.LC0
        pushl   $v
        call    memcmp
        addl    $12, %esp
        testl   %eax, %eax
There are tons of examples where you can improve code generation.
