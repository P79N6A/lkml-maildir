Its official: scripting causes brain damage. Now I know.
Thanks to several for pointing this out to me. One correspondent said that a
break statement is required by some compilers before exiting the switch
block by any branch. Is this in the standard?
The patch remains good, despite my aberrent reasoning. It fixes the problem
noted by Ronnie Misra. Is there a reason to prefer the unconventional order
of cases in these functions?
Someday I'll learn to recognise the flavor of my socks,
Tom
