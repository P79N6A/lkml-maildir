The only way to *create* a derivative work is with permission of the 
copyright owner of the original work. Period. This permission can come 
implicitly *if* you agree with licensing terms, but not under first sale 
or fair use *limitations*. (First sale / fair use are statutory 
limitations on copyrights, not rights).
