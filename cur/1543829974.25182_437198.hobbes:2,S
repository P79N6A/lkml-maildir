I see the following here, when a box is being ping flooded:
UP/SMP  stack-size  PIC-type  hi si
-----------------------------------
UP      8K          IO-APIC  0  16
UP      8K          XT-PIC   7  7
UP      4K          IO-APIC  0  16
UP      4K          XT-PIC   7  7
SMP     8K          IO-APIC  5  4 (forcedeth)
SMP     8K          IO-APIC  0  11 (tg3)
The UP system is a Thinkpad which only has a tg3 driven NIC. The SMP
system is x86_64, so there's no 4K stacks to test with, maybe I'll fetch
a i386 live CD to do some more valid tests on SMP.
The UP tests seem to show the IO-APIC hardirq are completely deferred
to be handled in a softirq, as the sum of "hi" and "si" with XT-PIC is
about equal to the "si" value with IO-APIC (the numbers are guessed
averages of the observed values, so the 2% difference is not too be
taken too serious).
The results for the forcedeth driven NIC do not agree though, and your
results differ from what I see as well, right? So I'm kinda lost again.
