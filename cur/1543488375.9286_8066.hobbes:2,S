I don't understand why you even want to poll. My approach was to clean
up at safe-delete time: I just do a stat(2) to see if there is enough
space left. If not, I start purging. And in your ~/.logout you can
call the command to empty the wastebasket.
If you want to get more fancy, set up a cron job or add something to
the boot scripts to clean up.
