This happens if the clocks of the different servers are not synchronized.
If you have a file whos modification time is in the future, ls will
behave like this. Observe:
$ touch foo
$ ls -l foo
-rw-rw-r--   1 miquels  staff           0 Jan 10 00:01 foo
$ touch --date="05:00" foo
$ ls -l foo               
-rw-rw-r--   1 miquels  staff           0 Jan 10  1999 foo
