Heh, prepare for some more mocking below...

You should NEVER declare a kobject statically.  There should be a check
in the kernel that complains about this on some arches in the -mm and
-next trees, I'm supprised you didn't hit it.
To quote from the kobject.txt documentation file:
	Because kobjects are dynamic, they must not be declared
	statically or on the stack, but instead, always allocated
	dynamically.  Future versions of the kernel will contain a
	run-time check for kobjects that are created statically and will
	warn the developer of this improper usage.
That is why you need a "real" release function.
So, care to respin this again please?
thanks,
