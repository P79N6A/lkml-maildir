Debian doesn't have this feature.
Debian policy tell us: i386 is fine. Performance gain is minimal (or nothing)
so compile with in i386 compatible mode.
(on package that performance matter, there exists an optional package with
an extra suffix (i.e. 686). So user can choice the more performant
package (but not the default)).
But numbers (profiles) have told us that such package are less then 1
every 1000.
[In debian-devel list this is a frequent flamewar. But until we have
'number' that told us to add a PPro optimization, we don't move.
Debian have not the the marketing need of other distributions.
(We are are the best distribution :-) ) ]
