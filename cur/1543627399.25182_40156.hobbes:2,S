Hi
I'm not familiar with the USB code, but I've been hitting a BUG() with my
new OHCI card (sorry, it was cheap :(   )
the BUG() is at line 464 in usb-ohci.h, which seems to be a linked-list
traversal failing to find an entry.
the backtrace /does/ seem to be the same every time. I dont have ksymoops
(on ARM I decode oopses with grep and system.map :). This appears not to
work so well for X86, but here goes...
c583708b  - n/a
c01098fc  - follows handle_IRQ_event
c0109a62  - preceeds request_irq
c0106c10  - default_idle
c0106c10  - default_idle
c0106c33  - follows default_idle
c0106c97  - follows cpu_idle
c0105000  - _stext
c0105027  - follows rest_init
