Somehow I doubt the "seizing up" problem is caused by too much
scanning.  In fact, I'm pretty convinced it is caused by having
too much IO submitted at once (and stalling in __get_request_wait).
The scanning is probably not relevant at all and it may be
beneficial to just ignore the scanning for now and do our best
to keep the pages in better LRU order.

Rik
