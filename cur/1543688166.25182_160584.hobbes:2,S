The SiS DRM uses sisfb to allocate the framebuffer memory (XFree86 uses
sisfb, too, when present).  There is currently no fallback method for
when sisfb is not present.  I am working at the moment on removing this
requirement.  We could have ifdeffed appropriately and built a
non-functional module, but that wasn't done.
I hope nobody minds me making massive style changes on the sis DRM
code.  I find it quite ugly at the moment.
