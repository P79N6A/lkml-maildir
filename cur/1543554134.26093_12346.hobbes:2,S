Thanks Ingo, I agree to this and also agree that we should try to be
able to run (mostly) everything from the same code base and I think
that's Linux does a great job on this.
Having a seperated code base for 0.0001% of mission critical servers
will lead to very bad availability or very high development cost at
least. In the worst (and not so unprobable) case it will lead to a lot
of games with licenses and 'intellectual property'. This would mean
that Linux fails to deliver on its promises IMHO.
Greetings
