On 2.6.3 + [1] + nfsd-lofft.patch running on a 1GB ram file server.   I 
have noticed two related issues.
First, under 2.6.3 it averages about 90MB[2] anon memory, and 30MB with 
the -mm4 vm (the rest is in swap cache).  This could balance out on the 
normal non-idle week-day load though...
Second the -mm4 vm, there is a lot more swapping[3] going on during the 
daily updatedb, and backup runs that are performed on this machine.
I'd have to call this second issue a regression, but I want to run it a 
couple more days to see if it gets any better (unless you agree of course).
