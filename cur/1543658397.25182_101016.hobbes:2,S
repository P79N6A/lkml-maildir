True, but it doesn't say that if you have two applications loaded on 
a SMP box, one which is for example constantly receiving and sending data 
from/to the network and doing computations on the data (100 % CPU) while 
some other app is only doing computations (also 100 % CPU), the ksoftirqd 
which should receive packets and refill the TX and RX rings will be put 
last in the queue because of its low nice level (19), thus the network 
dependent application has very much lower performance than what could be 
achieved with a nice level of 0 or even running the interrupt based 
mechanism. A nice level of 0 on ksoftirqd is still a heck of a lot better 
than interrupt context isn't it ?
One simple example would be to run a network throughput application 
such as netpipe, and simultaneously start something like the McAlpin 
stream test. You would notice that with a nice level of 19 (on ksoftirqd) 
the netpipe application would get very low throughput, while the stream 
application would be as optimal as it could get. With a nice level of 0 
the netpipe application would get decent throughput and the stream 
application would still produce the same result.
