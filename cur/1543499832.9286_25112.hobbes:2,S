Hi all-
 I've been away tearing my system down (literally) trying to discover
why I get file miscompares under 2.2.0.  After disabling all IDE
DMA/optimizations, etc, I've come across a strange observation.  
 It seems memcmp() is returning false miscompare status.  If I use a
for(){buf1[i] != buf2[i]} loop to scan the two read buffers after the
memcmp() check, I find that the buffers are, in fact, identical.   Now
what ????
 I imagine a paging, or buffer bounds issue could exits in the kernel,
or its a silly glib oversight.
 The compare program I'm using read continuous chunks of 16Mb from each
file and compares both until EOF.
 ideas ?
ron
