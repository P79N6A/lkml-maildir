No, no, no. We want them long and informative. 
The only thing I asked for was that text should have the visual separation 
also between different paragraphs.
I at no point asked you to make the thing shorter, I asked you to split it 
up and MAKE IT VISUALLY LONGER by adding the proper vertical whitespace 
(which is how we do paragraphs).

It's _purely_ an issue of overly long paragraphs, not about the language 
or any "formulaic" crap.
The fact is, paragraphs help make things more readable. 
What I find funny is how this email you just wrote actually has *much* 
shorter paragraphs than the changelog entry I replied to. 
Go back and look. The explanation I objected to was a single paragraph, 15 
lines long. That's about two thirds of the screen with no break.
And then, in the email reply you just sent (the one I'm replying to here), 
the longest one was nine lines and most were four or six lines, with one 
being three lines. Why? Because it's simply MORE READABLE.
I didn't ask you to write denser or less readable log messages, I asked 
for exactly the reverse. So I don't understand why you then made your 
reply be a rant about how you could make less explanatory changelog 
messages.
