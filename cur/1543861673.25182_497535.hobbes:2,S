Well, the filesystem obviously got corrupted.  The only question is
*why* it got corrupted.  It could be memory corruption, or a bug in
your propietary kernel patches, or some kind of hardware issue with
the CF device.  There's really no way to say for sure.
Were there any error messages in the system log from the device
driver?
