I am running sendmail-8.11-0.Beta3 on Linux 2.4.0-test9. I didn't
have any problem with it (except that the documentation sucks,
making it extremely difficult to configure). Once configured, it runs
fine. It also ran fine on Linux-2.2.17.
If something is staying in the mail-queue `mailq`, this means that
the daemon isn't running. It may have crashed. This can be caused
by somebody keeping some mailer entry in /etc/inetd.conf. Sendmail
has to run as a daemon with no other interference on port 25.
Check the configuration.
Cheers,
