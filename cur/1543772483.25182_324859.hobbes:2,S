Interesting .. So "cli" takes 7 cycles , "sti" takes 7 cycles. The current 
method does "lea" which takes 1 cycle, and "or" which takes 1 cycle. I'm 
not sure if there is any function call overhead .. So the soft replacment 
of cli/sti is 70% faster on a per instruction level .. So it's at least 
not any slower .. Does everyone agree on that?
