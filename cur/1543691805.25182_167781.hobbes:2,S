The point here is that the default must work for 99% of the userbase.
Either that or the default is totally broken.
So the rest of 1% should be ok to add the command line, and they should
be very happy that when they overflow again even with 128k because their
cpu is too slow to keep up in klogd or whatever, they can change it to
256k without replacing kernels, some embedded platforms especially
should like it. And only this 1% would be the one recompiling the kernel
by themself anyways, and if they can recompile the kernel they can as
well edit the defaults in kernel/printk.c without pain.
I don't buy much the lazyness argument in changing lilo.conf, the people
who need this feature is a marginal part so they must be ok with the
parmeter. And don't tell me that you don't pass root= to the kernel at
boot. Do you want to fix that too? I do pass plenty of argumetns all the
time, starting from profile=0 (and often acpi=off).
however I won't complain if you put the compile time configurator on top
of my patch (that's easy) but personaly I think it's not needed, and
having it dyanmic is an order of magnitude more important than having it
static (again: if you can afford to recompile the kernel than you could
edit kernel/printk.c in the first place without much slowdown).
