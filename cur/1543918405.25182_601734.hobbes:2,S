Sure.  My expectation is if we happened to hit such a narrow window
the irq would simply be dropped.

Right.  And INTx has such a pending bit as well.  I guess I figured
if MSI was enabled transferring it over would be the obvious thing to
do.

It's worth looking at, I think that happens in the common case.
Of course it might even make sense simply to refuse to enable MSI
if there is not a masking capability present.

I would have to look it up again but it said that the result is only
defined in the case when it is disabled/masked, when I looked a couple
of months ago.

I will relook.  My impression is that bit is defined as MSI enable.
Not mode switch.   Although myrinet has clearly implemented it as
mode switch.

Interesting.  So an irq fires before the driver has finished
processing the last instance of the irq.  This is very close to a
screaming irq and something we may actually want to deal with.
