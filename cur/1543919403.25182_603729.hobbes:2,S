I think it's implicit in the interface, since you don't pass an sgtable
in. But it's not a big deal to me, if you want it changed, go ahead :-)

Sure, of you could just lookup sg_last() in the beginning of the loop.
Still seems a bit silly to me just to keep the ata_sg_is_last()
interface, since it can be done for free basically by maintaining an
sglast element in the loop that you then use when the loop is done to
set your SG_END marker (or whatever the driver needs).
