No particular reason other than that I wanted to experiment with
the priority of the kernel threads when we test it under heavy load.
If all these are deemed necessary, I will clean it up.
There is one minor irritant - I need to check if the worker thread
for my cpu is running or not. I will have to add something to do
that since this whole thing is conditional and also RCU is initialized
before workqueues.
Thanks
