Can I build recent glibc such that it will work both on
2.6 and on 2.4 ? (multithreading-wise, I suppose). I tried
to boot recent 2.6-based distro with 2.4 kernel and it did not work.
Do I need to set some env.vars maybe (LD_ASSUME_KERNEL ?
GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION ?) for glibc when I switch kernels ?
