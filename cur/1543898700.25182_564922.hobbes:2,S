Sorry, but it's really annoying to pull in a filesystem-specific devel
package for that.  Having a library is fine, but please move the library
into util-linux so it's always available without another dependency.  That
way xfsprogs could for example drop it's own detection library aswell.

And this is really dumb.  autotools is a completely pain in the ass and
not useful at all for linux-only tools.
