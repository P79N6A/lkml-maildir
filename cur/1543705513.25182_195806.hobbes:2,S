"Blank" is a single scsi command, 3 bits of the command specify what type
of blanking to perform.  So cdrecord isn't doing something devious, it's
well defined in the MMC standard.
Just making cdrecord -eject at the end of the process will probably
workaround what is almost certainly a hardware bug.  or just eject the
disc by hand before attempting to re-use it.
I had an old writer that did much the same thing.  After burning a disc,
it would still see it as blank until you ejected and reloaded.
to Martin:
Does cdrecord -toc still show a valid toc after you blank the disc?
(definately buggy hardware)
And does ejecting and reloading the disc make things work as expected?
