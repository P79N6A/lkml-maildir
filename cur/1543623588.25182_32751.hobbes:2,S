Please don't send that.  It clearly appears to be a user problem.
Order of operations, as I read in the original email:
1) "/" and "/usr" are busy
2) shut down to single user mode
3) "/" still busy
4) "/usr" can be unmounted
5) didn't check that root can be remounted after umounting "/usr"
Clearly, some program is keeping "/usr" busy (which is keeping "/" busy)
before the change to single user mode.  Just a bit of "lsof" needed to
find such things.
Cheers, Andreas
