Something like what kallsyms does? Read .tmp_vmlinux2, extract and
filter relocations, pack them in relocs.S, build reloc.o and relink it back
to .tmp_vmlinux2 to make vmlinux. Then arch/i386/kernel/head.S can perform
the relocations. But any additiona step of re-linking after final kallsyms
information has been generated can potentially spoil kallsyms data?
