Whats wrong with:
	mount old filesystem
	mkfs newfilesystem on different disk
	mount new filesystem
	cd old filesystem
	tar -cfp - . | (cd new_filesystem; tar -xfp -)
Which is what I do.
If I MUST do something more in-place replacement....
	1. backup to tape
	2. backup to tape (never hurts)
	3. verify tape
	4. umount old_filesystem
	5. mkfs new_filesystem (same disk)
	6. mount new_filesystem
	7. restore from tape
A lot longer. but there is no "kludgy userspace tool that has to be
rewritten to understand them all".
