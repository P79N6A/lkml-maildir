I agree but many people use menuconfig and may not even be aware of
a driver if it is hidden because facility it depends on is not
selected. The same with oldconfig - unless you are closely monitor
all changelogs (I for example don't, I just pull from Linus) you
would not even get prompted for UCB1400 if you do not have sound
enabled.

Would not adding "select SOUND" fix it? We could use it as a bandaid
until kconfig os fixed.
