But it doesn't --- page_launder can try to lock the page after it
checks the refcount, without taking any locks which protect us against
running lookup_swap_cache in parallel.  If we get our reference after
page_launder checks the count, we can find the page getting locked out
from underneath our feet.

Exactly.  We're not in danger of _losing_ the page, because
reclaim_page is locked more aggressively than page_launder.  We still
risk having the page locked against us after lookup_swap_cache does
its own UnlockPage.
So, if lookup_swap_cache doesn't actually ensure that the page is
unlocked, are there any callers which implicitly rely on
lookup_swap_cache() doing a wait_on_page?
