How much memory is needed for HIGHMEM to be neccessary? Is it 1GB? If
so, I can well imagine 1GB laptop....

This certainly does not work. We'd need to do some deep magic in
suspend_asm.S to copy pages back. [Well, deep magic... Same
kmap_atomic.] But suspend_asm.S has to guarantee not touching any
memory so the change is not quite trivial.

I definitely want to support swsusp for server boxes, but I'm not 100%
sure how to do that easily.
