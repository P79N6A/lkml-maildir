I'm absolutely serious and yes, by now I consider the possibility
that you _really_ don't bother to read the core kernel code as very
probable.  Style incompatibilities give a very plausible explanation -
I certainly can understand why somebody used to common kernel style
can have trouble reading code in your style and vice versa.
The question still stands, BTW - should your "...I would be unable to
read..." be taken seriously?
