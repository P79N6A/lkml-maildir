You're still missing the point of flexibility remark.  Changing the
optimization level has nothing to do with CONFIG_TINY, and is a
generally useful option, and should be done seperate from CONFIG_TINY.
In fact people seem to be getting the wrong idea about CONFIG_TINY.  We
don't need a CONFIG_TINY, we need CONFIG_FINE_TUNE.  Different 'tiny'
projects need different things.  And when you take into account that the
embedded world is a whole lot of !i386, the fact that -Os hasn't been as
well tested on !i386, you introduce the possibility of compiler bugs
sneaking in as well.
In other words, s/CONFIG_TINY/CONFIG_FINE_TUNE, and ask about anything /
everything which might want to be tuned up.  Then this becomes a truely
useful set of options, since as Alan pointed out in one of the earlier
CONFIG_TINY threads, his Athlon could benefit from some of these 'tiny'
options too.
