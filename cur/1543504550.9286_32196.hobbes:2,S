this is an old issue, you should read the archived mails to get a clue
BTW 
http://www.kt.opensrc.org
 made a good resume too

nope.. you are just lucky. from the NEWS file for gcc 2.91.66 for egcs 1.1
"More major improvements have been made to the alias analysis code.  A new
 option to allow front-ends to provide alias information to the optimizers
 has also been added (-fstrict-aliasing).  -fstrict-aliasing is off by
 default now, but will be enabled by default in the future."
