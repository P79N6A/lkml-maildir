Subject: 2.6.0, cdrom still showing directories after being erased

I have debian's 2.6.0-686-smp only with PNP BIOS disabled (fails to
boot with enabled, as described by other people).
I did
$ mount /cdrom/
$ ls /cdrom/
got listing of files and directories on the cdrom
then
$ cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc -blank=fast -v
...
Blanking time:   21.570s
$ mount /cdrom
$ ls /cdrom
got the listing again!
could even 'cd' to a directory, couldn't read files
$ umount /cdrom
$ eject /cdrom; eject -t /cdrom
$ mount /cdrom
now I got the error which I would expect after erasing the CD and trying
to mount it
seems to me like some cache should have been invalidated, but was not
cdrecord:
    Cdrecord-Clone 2.01a19 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
cdrom:
    0,0,0     0) 'HL-DT-ST' 'RW/DVD GCC-4480B' '1.00' Removable CD-ROM
p.s. sorry if I'm reporting something already repaired, but I have
searched the archive, changelog and asked google before writing here
