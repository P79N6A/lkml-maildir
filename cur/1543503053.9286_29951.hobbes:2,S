Indeed a good userspace solution would prevent the kernel from ever
executing the last resort emergency code.
People however tend to mix things up and think a good userspace solution
is a REPLACEMENT for proper emergency handling by the kernel, or that
both should be combined. They should not.
Designing a good userspace solution will take some time, and there won't
be a one-solution-fits-all thingy.
The last resort kernel emergency code should be completely self-contained,
independent from userspace. When we get there, everything else has already
failed.
