Aren't they both the same ? Everytime an incoming ACK frees up a buffer
from the retransmit queue, the writability condition is freshly asserted,
much the same way as the readability condition is asserted everytime a 
new data is queued in the socket receive queue (irrespective of 
whether there was data already waiting to be read in the receive queue).
This difference in meaning of POLLOUT only arises in the ET case, which was
not what traditional Unix poll referred to. 
Since its a new game the rules can be modified (ofcourse based on the 
merits i.e. usability)
Thanx,
Tomar
