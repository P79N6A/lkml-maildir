I was assuming debugging work, yes.  I was also thinking it wouldn't
be done at clone() time, but mapped (on a single CPU) at the time of a
context switch.  It would eliminate IPI, but would probably make the
rest of the TLB handling much too ugly to contemplate.    As an
alternative, could the TLB flush and associated IPI be deferred until
the process migrates?   First migration would trigger flush/IPI,
further migration would be as now, no?   I'd happily run it with
various dm/md layers underneath

Because the kernel mapping covers all physical memory contiguously, so
if the page isn't allocated, it could be used by a kernel data
structure you need to access.  Same reason the kernel stack has to be
contiguous pages.   Well, for non-highmem at least.  Either way, you
don't want to mark an in-use page as inaccessable, you never know
what's under there.
