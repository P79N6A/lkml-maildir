Yuck, I dislike.  Please don't take away this nice development workflow. 
  the current workflow of
	make ARCH=i386 allmodconfig && make ARCH=i386 -sj5
no longer works.  Now, the new and ungainly step of editing the .config 
is added, with vi or sed.
This also opens a chicken-and-egg problem...  What kind of config is 
generated by allmodconfig when ARCH==x86?  There is no good answer.
The existing tradition of switching between 32-bit and 64-bit was quite 
nice, and it was done in The Obvious Way(tm) -- via the method for 
specifying the architecture/platform.  Switching to Kconfig for that 
decision is a step backwards in usability and IMO violates the Principle 
of Least Surprise.
