Some SGI guys tried to base their own Origin 200 port on their own
toolchain.  The result was ...  less than great ...
Most of us know pretty well how to write C to achieve a certain output.
Look at loops like:
        a = addr & ~(dc_lsize - 1);
        end = (addr + size) & ~(dc_lsize - 1);
        while (1) {
                ...
                if (a == end) break;
                a += dc_lsize;
        }
Looks weird?  Maybe, but generates best possible assembler code.  So while
we write C we often tend to think in assembler.

Often trying a different gcc version serves the same purpose.
