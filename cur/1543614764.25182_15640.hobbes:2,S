As long as the patch does not change an include file that is used a
lot, yes, a patch and make will be significantly faster using kbuild
2.5.
What Mr. Fishtank seems to overlook is that kbuild 2.5 is far more
flexible and accurate than 2.4, including features that lots of people
want, like separate source and object trees.  Now that the overall
kbuild design is correct, the core code can be rewritten for speed.
And that will be done a couple of weeks after kbuild 2.5 goes into the
kernel, then I expect kbuild 2.5 to be faster than kbuild 2.4 even on
full builds.
