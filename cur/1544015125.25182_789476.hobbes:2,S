huh, not nice indeed!
While looking at the code to see how this could be possible, I
came across this minor thing (unrelated IMHO) :
	if (__skb_splice_bits(skb, &offset, &tlen, &spd))
		goto done;
>>>>>>	else if (!tlen)    <<<<<<
		goto done;
	/*
	 * now see if we have a frag_list to map
	 */
	if (skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list) {
		struct sk_buff *list = skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list;
		for (; list && tlen; list = list->next) {
			if (__skb_splice_bits(list, &offset, &tlen, &spd))
				break;
		}
	}
    done:
Above on the enlighted line, we'd better remove the else and leave a plain
"if (!tlen)". Otherwise, when the first call to __skb_splice_bits() zeroes
tlen, we still enter the if and evaluate the for condition for nothing. But
let's leave that for later.

I've checked in skb_splice_bits() and below and can't see how we can move
more than the requested len.
However, with your change, I don't clearly see how we break out of
the loop in tcp_read_sock(). Maybe we first read 1000 then loop again
and read remaining data ? I suspect that we should at least exit when
((struct tcp_splice_state *)desc->arg.data)->len = 0.
At least that's something easy to add just before or after !desc->count
for a test.
