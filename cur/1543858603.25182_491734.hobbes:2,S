The piix_host_stop() isn't actually called on my machine, so this is
not the cause of the leak.
What causes the leak seem to be the error returned by
ata_pci_init_one() called from piix_init_one(). These are the related
kernel messages:
ata_piix 0000:00:1f.1: version 2.00ac7
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.1[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
PCI: Unable to reserve I/O region #1:8@1f0 for device 0000:00:1f.1
ata_piix: probe of 0000:00:1f.1 failed with error -16
I think the call to ata_pci_init_one() should be followed by some
clean-up in case it fails. There is also another return without
clean-up in piix_init_one() after the call to piix_disable_ahci(). I
don't have time to try this now.
