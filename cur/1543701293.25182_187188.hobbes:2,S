It seems to me that the bk export test is a measure of memory pressure and 
io performance.  On my good system with plenty of resources I see very 
little difference between 2.4 and 2.6.  On my laptop with a slower 
processor, less memory, and a slower hard drive I get dramatic 
differences, depending on workload.  
I'm not sure what to think of the bk export test to tell you the truth.  
i've noticed for some time that 2.6 seemed to perform worse than 2.4.  It 
was a simple "real world" test that I could use to gather real performance 
data.  
If I am understanding you, you would like data on 2.5.27, 2.5.38, and 
2.5.39.  I'll do it if it will help something.  I'll look at it in the 
next couple of days.
