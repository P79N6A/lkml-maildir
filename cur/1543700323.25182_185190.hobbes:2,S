Ok. I've attached the logs from a run with a call with only an
additional dd. The quality was almost undisturbed only very slightly
worse than the unloaded case.

Worse than unloaded and worse than the disk loaded case from above. But
all (CPU) loaded cases were producing almost complete audio dropouts
while with your scheduler and renicing to -10 I got at least a
stuttering audio stream (a regular pattern of very short slices of audio
mixed with very short slices of silence).

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
                      (Henry David Thoreau)
