I am hoping I can get away with just this patch; the idea is to give the
cache_cache slab a special lock type since it'll be nested all the time
(and has a natural ordering due to it's special position in the slab
code). I'm not yet sure I found all places where this stuff is
initialized (the slab code has gotten terribly complex with all the numa
stuff added to it); I've started to test this now at least and so far it
seems to work on my test box.
