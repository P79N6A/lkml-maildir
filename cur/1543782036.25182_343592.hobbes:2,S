Sounds reasonable.

It seems you have a wrong impression of what EMBEDDED in the kernel 
does.
There is _not_ a choice EMBEDDED/WORKSTATION/SERVER.
EMBEDDED is an option that shows "save space at any cost" options.
It allows you to tell gcc to generate slower but faster code or to 
deselect options in the "do this only if you _really_ know what you are 
doing" class.
