Hi,
A friend of mine uses linux-2.4.4 on his nice dual P3-1000 machine
(AsusTek Motherboard). The problem is that the kernel gets stuck at the
initialization of the APIC during boottime. The real weird thing is that
if he boots linux-2.2.18 and afterwards 2.4.4, the kernel boots
properly. So it seems that kernel 2.2 does some "initalization" that
helps 2.4.4 to boot.
Does anyone have a clue?
		Best Regards,
		Hermann
