I didn't say don't document it and I didn't say don't make notice of it.  I said do it
the right way and fix it, give the distros a chance to patch it in and then announce
it.  This is the standard ~two week courtesy.  It's rather irresponsible to release an
exploit without people having a fix available, even if there are only a few hours
between the two.  The exploit should -always- come after the fix unless the fixer
refuses to fix.
Read again what I wrote :)
Don't make a big issue of it until the patch is made and available, once it is, spread
the word far and wide.

A good sysadmin should be terrified of script kiddies that can mutilate his system and
he has no way to protect himself because there isn't a fix yet.

Not really.  Some of us weren't understanding what he was saying simply due to language
differences.  Andre gets highly upset because he misinterprets what one guy says and
another guy doesn't understand what Andre means.  I understood it rather quickly but
that doesn't mean everyone correctly interpreted what he was saying.
