acpi_lapic isn't related to the problem at hand -- that  smp_found_config is not set.
That said, allowing acpi_lapic=1 to bail out of this check has the sole
function of allowing SMP/PIC configurations.  (smp_found_config
in ACPI mode is set if acpi_lapic and acpi_ioapic are set)
SMP/PIC configurations are not very interesting, except for debugging.
Indeed, MPS prohibits them by mandating an IOAPIC be present for SMP --
but ACPI has no such rule.
