Ok, so after the holidays I will do the following:
let memtest86+ run several hours.
do a full backup&restore to switch to r3 and build an unpatched kernel.
see if I can reproduce the oops with .21 and .22 (because AFAIR no oops with 
21.. but I might be wrong).
Not exactly in that order.
Glück Auf
Volker
