Assuming you want to learn assembly for x86 -
I have found it easier to first understand the machine and basics of low level 
software/hardware interaction and then move on to learn assembly language - 
machine organization and related basics are nicely covered in the 
Book "Writing Great Code" by Randall Hyde who also has written a very thorough 
and excellent book (freely downloadable from 
http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/
) Art 
of Assembly Language Programming.
