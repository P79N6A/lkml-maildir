(Message-ID: 1156447273.3418.34.camel@josh-work.beaverton.ibm.com); with
that patch, sparse can track a context expression per context.  I plan
to make sparse use that context expression to track contexts
independently to improve the correctness and usefulness of context
warnings.  The Linux patch "Pass sparse the lock expression given to
lock annotations" that I just sent (Message-ID:
1156466936.3418.58.camel@josh-work.beaverton.ibm.com) changes
__acquires, __releases, __acquire, and __release to stop ignoring the
lock expression, and pass it to sparse.
