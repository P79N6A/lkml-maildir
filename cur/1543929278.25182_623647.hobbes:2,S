Hi Christoph,
    Why do you think this is true?  You're still doing arithmetic on variable 
addresses beyond the bound of the variable.

This last point is orthogonal to offsetting at zero though...

Hmm, can't you just define __per_cpu_start and __per_cpu_end in the linker 
script and fold this code back together again?

I found the original clearer; why change it?
Cheers,
