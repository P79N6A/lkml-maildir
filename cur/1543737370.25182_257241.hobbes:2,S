Subject: 2.6.x: [no]lapic and start up / shutdown problems

The first 2.6 kernel (2.6.3) I ran on my ancient PII-300 box
required nolapic appended, otherwise the system would
say "halting" on shutdown, but then wouldn't power off.
Adding nolapic to recent kernels, however, means that
the system won't get past "calibrating delay loop..." on
start-up. This is true of 2.6.8.1, but started at least as far
back as 2.6.7.
