You can also find in that threads that I managed to run epoll server on 
that machine with 9k requests per second, although that was not
reproducible again.

You just draw a picture you want to see.
Even on the kevent page I have links to other people's benchmarks, which
show how kevent behave compared to epoll in theirs load.
_My_ tests showed kevent performance win, you tuned my (can be
broken) epoll code and results changed - this is developemnt process,
where things are not obtained from the air.

Well, I do not care much about what people think I did wrong or right.
There are obviously bad and good ideas and implementations.
I might be absolutely wrong with something, but that is a process of
solving problems, which I really enjoy.
I just want that there sould be no personal insults, if I made such things,
shame on me :)
