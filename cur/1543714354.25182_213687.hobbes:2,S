of course it is correlated to that of namesys! i have no skills at all
to invent reiser4 :))
you forgot to specify version of the patch you are talking about,
currently debian provides two versions. anyway i suppose you are talking
about version 20040326-2, aren't you?

latest reiser4 snapshot provided a patch which applied cleanly on
2.6.5-rc2 but not to 2.6.5. i had to modify it as suggested on the
reiserfs ml. if you look at the debian package's changelog you can find
the reference to that thread.
