bplay.  I used sox to convert the .wav file to other sample types.

I have no clue why either.  I remember someone sending a .wav file to me
that he said causes a problem with this card.  The 2nd dsp plays it w/o
problems, but the first has static.  I guess you've played with this.  I
thought it was odd that it only happened on 8bit stereo samples.  I don't do
windoze so I can't try the sound under winblows.

P.S.  I got bored the other day and decided to play around with this
problem.  This is how I found out it was 8bit stereo samples that caused the
problem (and most everything I play is 16bit or 8bit mono) and thought I'd
post my results to the list.
