Considering how even real releases in the development tree are likely to
be broken (never mind the _trivial_ brokenness of applying the same patch
to init/main.c twice, I'm talking about the more fundamental brokenness of
just broken drivers and filesystems due to development), I'm not sure how
big a deal that is.
And I do make full tar-files of real releases, so that people can skip a
few (although unless you have a fast connection it usually only makes
sense after 10 full releases or so).

I'll try to keep them coming a bit more often.
