Oh, I misunderstood your mail.
I thought you wanted to automatically add extra nodes to the cpuset,
but you actually want to do just the opposite, i.e restrict the nodemask 
for this task to the one passed to sys_migrate_pages(). Is that right ?
(If not, ignore the rest of this message)
Maybe sometimes the user would be interested in migrating all the 
existing pages of a process, but not change the policy for the future ?
