	Alexey, could you comment on test for tsk->dead in unix_accept()?
Just what is tested there? It had been added in 2.1.124 and AFAICS there
is no way to ->dead on a passed sock to be set. Was it just-in-case test
or should it be unix_peer(tsk)->dead? IOW, if somebody did connect()
and then close() before we accept() should we return this (hung)
connection on accept()?
