I updated the test case (basically just set CHECk to be a NOP).  Can you
please download and re-run the test case?  After reboot, run dosfsck -a on
the crashed disk, you'll see some output like:
dosfsck 2.10, 22 Sep 2003, FAT32, LFN
/å004  and
/0005
  share clusters.
  Truncating second to 0 bytes.
/0005
  File size is 4 bytes, cluster chain length is 0 bytes.
  Truncating file to 0 bytes.
Performing changes.
/dev/sbd0: 5 files, 4/8167 clusters
This causes file /0005 to be truncated to 0.
