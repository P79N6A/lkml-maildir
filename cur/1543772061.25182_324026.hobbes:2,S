Heh, well my definition is when Fscale has the reference manual
downloadable from the main website...as of last night that wasn't
the case for 8548. :)

No problem. The first "ppc85xx_rio.c" was only intended to work on
the 8540/8560 stuff where I had hardware. From my look at 8548, it
shouldn't take much work.
