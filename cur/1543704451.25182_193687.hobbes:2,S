If we are going to open this, I would like to eliminate the "MIGS_SIGEV" stuff. 
  If you can wait till Monday...
Another issue is that this is the only place in the kernel where SIGRTMAX is 
used (or it was a few months ago).  If memory serves, it also seems that it is 
the wrong value in at least some archs.
