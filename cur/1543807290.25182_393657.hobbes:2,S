Yes, the other gcc's will no doubt have a different amount of increase.
Yes, i386 text sizes seem to run half the size of ia64.
No, I said "text" size, not file size.  Meaning with the size command.
That same 776 byte size difference in text size showed up in the final
vmlinux, which I just verified.
This is not a 'big problem.'  It's just a curiosity, for which an
explanation might provide interesting insight to what this patch is
doing.
