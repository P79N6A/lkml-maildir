oh.. and spamming over 3000 peoples mailboxes again and again with the
virus and the mails from this "exchange-virus-scanner-thingies" is ok
just because outlook is stupid enough to execute uuencoded win32 binarys?
people that cannot get their firewalls to run correcty even can't get mail
from this list cause of ECN activated. (imho)
just name a reason why helping such crappy software surviving is a good
thing.
supporting dirty workarouds doesn't help a bit fixing problems/bugs... it
only makes them usual an so nobody will fix it.
thanks.. but i think this is OT.. so i stop here
