Hello again,
If I start a system that has 1 Gb of memory with mem=500m,
the value of the kernel's num_physpages is 0x20000 as would
be expected. If I multiply that by PAGE_SIZE, I get 0x20000000,
also as expected. If I observe that memory region, I note
that somebody has written something there!
This is not good. The kernel touches RAM it doesn't own. I have
booted the system with only the internal floppy controller
and no other modules installed. I see the same thing.

My temporary work around for the kernel's destroying a
precious DMA buffer is to start one page higher. However,
whomever is writing to that RAM is likely writing other
places it doesn't belong also. This could lead to some
very interesting bugs.
Note that the value written there is 0x12345678, twice, once
in little endian and another in swap-nibble big endian, like
a mirror. This is evil.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
