    fix the softlockup watchdog to actually work
 ...
Causes my SMP niagara systems to trigger the softlockup message
frequently when the nohz timer fires.
The backtrace is always in the timer handler, the cpu is not
wedged at all, which makes me think it's likely triggering
erroneously.
I suspect that what is happening is that the NOHZ period is
longer than the softlockup timeout (10 seconds) and we get
an interrupt before the watchdog thread gets onto the cpu.
I'll happily test any suggested fix for this bug, thanks!
