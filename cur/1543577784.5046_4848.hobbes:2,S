That was me. ramfs is mimnimalist and if we must extend/bloat ramfs
then I suggest we adding a backing store al la tmpfs or memfs and
change it's name.
Don't get me wrong, I _like_ ramfs and want a backing store and
perhaps limits (I use ramfs for /tmp and decided to put over a
million files in there once as a test, kaboom), but I'm no guru and
would love to see ramfs stay as is -- because _I_ can understand it.
To me, that is worth a lot -- ramfs is only 8k, tiny to keep about as
an example I should think.
    I wonder what to do about this - the limits are obviously useful,
    as would the "use swap-space as a backing store" thing be. At the
    same time I'd really hate to lose the lean-mean-clean ramfs.
ramfs-> skeletonfs    
ramfs+bloat -> vmfs
