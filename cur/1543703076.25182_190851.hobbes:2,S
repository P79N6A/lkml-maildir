I've seen a ridiculous amount of broken PST's from folks running the K7 driver
too. Given the complete lack of help from some vendors[1], I think I might
add a minimal ACPI parser there too when I get time, as an alternative
source of info when the PST is obviously crap.

Part of the justification for cpufreq (at least on x86) was an alternative
for when ACPI just doesn't work, or for when folks either don't want to,
or can't run ACPI (through various other AML bugs for eg).
For minimal parsing of the ACPI P state tables, we shouldn't need the
full-blown interpretor IMO.
