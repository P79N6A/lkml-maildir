The io_load test takes as long as the time in seconds shown on the table. At 
least 3 tests are appropriate to get a reasonable average [runs is in square 
parentheses]. Therefore it takes about half an hour per run. Luckily I had 
the benefit of a night to set up a whole lot of runs:
io_load:

Test hardware is 1133Mhz P3 laptop with 5400rpm ATA100 drive. I don't doubt 
the response curve would be different for other hardware.
