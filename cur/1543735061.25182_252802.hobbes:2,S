I've been seeing this as well, although I'm pretty sure I have profiling
disabled.  Are you sure it isn't the combination of SMP support and
frame pointers that causes this bug to occur? (It looks like
profile_pc() takes on a different implementation only if both CONFIG_SMP
and CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is defined.)
