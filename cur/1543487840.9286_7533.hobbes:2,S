I've seen it happen on a 256Mb 2.2.1 box verified with monitoring printks. 
I suspect the 2.2.1 "we queue too much I/O" bug may well have had a lot to
do with how it got so fragmented, but it happens and we do need some kind
of low key defragmentation goal in the VM, just to kick in occasionally and
do the hoovering.
