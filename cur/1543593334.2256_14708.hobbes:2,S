Fine. So it should be possible to do it on all architectures with 
physically-indexed caches - that's good. Architectures with 
virtually-indexed caches are going to have explicit cache management 
functionality anyway, presumably :)
Obviously the algorithm you describe should not be implemented in
arch-independent drivers. It should be in include/asm-*, for those
architectures which _can't_ do it with a single cache management instruction
(or loop of same).
What shall we call this function? The intuitive "flush_dcache_range" appears
to have already been taken.
