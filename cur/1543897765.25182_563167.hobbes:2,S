Oh, wow, that is so much nicer than the first version, Michal. ;)
Still, I think there's possibly one further revision:

Hmmm - this is almost all duplicated code. It's pretty much what I
described, but maybe not /quite/ what I had in mind here. It's a
*big* improvement on the first version, but it seems now that the
only real difference xfs_bulkstat_one() and
xfs_bulkstat_one_compat() is copy_to_user() vs the discrete put_user
calls.
I think we can remove xfs_bulkstat_one_compat() completely by using
the same method you used with the xfs_inumber_fmt functions. That
would mean the only duplicated code is the initial ioctl handling
(which we can't really avoid). It would also mean that there is no
need to make xfs_bulkstat_one_iget() and xfs_bulkstat_one_dinode()
non-static. Your thoughts?
Other than that possible improvement, this looks really good.
Cheers,
Dave.
