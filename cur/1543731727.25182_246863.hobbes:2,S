Although, whether or not the kernel exposes file permissions as an
attribute named permissions is up to the filesystem. (And the wrong
thing to do, in my opinion, but that's irrelevant.)

It can be opened by both, but in order to do it via open(2), you need to
fchdir(2) to the attribute directory as returned by openat(2) and then
use a relative pathname.
