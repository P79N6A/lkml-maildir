Hey Mattia, 
	Sorry I've been so quiet recently, I'm still working on this one.  The
difficult spot is that if the cpufreq notification driver is a module,
then there will always be a window between the point at which we start
using the TSC to the point where we find out that the TSC is changing
frequency. Not sure what to do here just yet.
Although I'm curious: Did the recent changes in 2.6.16-rc1-mm2 had any
effect on this issue?
thanks
