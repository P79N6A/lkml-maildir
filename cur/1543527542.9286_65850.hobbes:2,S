Subject: Bug in virt_to_bus() in 2.2.14 and 2.3.46?

   It looks as if virt_to_bus() and virt_to_phys() don't work on
addresses that point to module code. I'm using this in a driver:
#define firmware_size 547
static char firmware_data[] = {
   233,253,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
/* ... */
};
	if (net_debug >= 2)
		printk ("ne3200: Uploading firmware (virt = 0x%08lx, bus = 0x%08lx, phys = 0x%08lx, size = 0x%04x)...\n",
		        (unsigned long) firmware_data, virt_to_bus (firmware_data), virt_to_phys (firmware_data), firmware_size);
	fwcopy = kmalloc (firmware_size, GFP_KERNEL);
	memcpy (fwcopy, firmware_data, firmware_size);
	if (net_debug >= 2)
		printk ("ne3200: Uploading firmware (virt = 0x%08lx, bus = 0x%08lx, phys = 0x%08lx, size = 0x%04x)...\n",
		        (unsigned long) fwcopy, virt_to_bus (fwcopy), virt_to_phys (fwcopy), firmware_size);
which results in (dmesg, linux 2.3.46, but same problem in 2.2.14):
ne3200: Uploading firmware (virt = 0xc1824284, bus = 0x01824284, phys = 0x01824284, size = 0x0223)...
ne3200: Uploading firmware (virt = 0xc0e5d000, bus = 0x00e5d000, phys = 0x00e5d000, size = 0x0223)...
   This is on a 486 PC with 16 MB of memory, so obviously the first set of
bus and physical addresses are wrong. The second set works as expected.
   The question is: Is this a virt_to_bus()/virt_to_phys() bug or just
undocumented behaviour?
