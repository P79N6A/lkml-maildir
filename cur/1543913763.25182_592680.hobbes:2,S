If we do the --gc-sections trick during the preparational link then we do
not use the arch supplied linker script.
Will it be possible to create a dedicated linker script that is valid
for all architectures and which only include the KEEP() directives for
the diverse sections?
That would also free us from modifying a lot of arch linker scripts uglifying
them even more than they are today.
