Actually, the 2TB limit affects all architectures, as we assume that
block indexes fit into 32 bits.  Blocks are passed around as unsigned
longs in some cases, but even on 64-bit machines that doesn't help us
as the limit still persists in the filesystem (32-bit block numbers)
and device drivers (ints and 4-byte sector numbers used when
generating SCSI commands).
Auditing the whole driver path to allow 64-bit block numbers, and
adding the logic to generate the 5th sector address byte in the scsi
command when we're doing 10-byte commands, are all possible extensions
for 2.5.  For now, though, the 2TB device limit is with us for all
architectures and all filesystems on 2.4.
