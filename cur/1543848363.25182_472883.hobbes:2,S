        Your idea sounds good to me.
So naturally I'm wondering why the functionality was dropped.
An application I had in mind was to identify which of the boot-time
calls to the slab allocator must not fail but are not yet marked
__GFP_NOFAIL (some experimentation showed that for pid 1 there are
lots of these).
Andrew: Would such an exercise would be worth the effort?
