It might be nice if you could enable "show BROKEN" options, and have them 
appear in the list without being able to select them...

But then you can accidentally enable something else that really is broken 
in the way you're going to use it. What you really want is to be able to 
override the BROKEN marking on individual options, not to override all 
BROKEN markings. Perhaps there should be a way to enable an option with 
unmet dependencies, such that the dependencies are treated as enabled for 
the purpose of building, but not for the purpose of making options that 
also depend on the same things available. This would also be nice for the 
case where you don't generally want EXPERIMENTAL drivers, but you do want 
a particular one that you've personally found to be stable.
