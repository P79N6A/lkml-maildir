I don't see how exporting a set of indices on file attributes to 
userspace constitutes putting part of the name resolution into 
userspace. A file's name (or names, in the case of hardlinks) would 
still be determined entirely within the filesystem.
The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that "the index" is 
the correct primative to use for exposing any filesystem's fast 
searching features.
