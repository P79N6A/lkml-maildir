This is *not* the point!
This isn't about how we should store this kind of stuff on ext2fs -
that's an implementation detail to be discussed when we get to "how do 
we emulate this on filesystems that don't support it".
It's about how we access it on filesystems that support it already.
The ONLY reason you can tar/untar on HFS without data loss is because
there's a cheap hack in there to allow it. If you try the same thing on an
NTFS partition, you loose any streams that are there already.
Without a clear set of semantics, each filesystem will end up working
differently and kludgily, or as things are now, some will work and some
won't.
