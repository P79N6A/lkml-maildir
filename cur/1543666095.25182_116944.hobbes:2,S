Does the cmd_per_lun element of the Scsi_Host_Template structure serve
more than one purpose?  In scsi_alloc_sdev it is passed into
scsi_adjust_queue_depth.  In the aacraid case this is 512.  Later the
aacraid driver (in aac_slave_configure) sets the queue depth to either
128 for tagged or 1 if not.
