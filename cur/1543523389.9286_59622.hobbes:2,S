Any reversible binary operation -- a XOR b, a + b, encrypt a with
key b, ... -- provides that.
The attacker doesn't know a before the operation. Afterward, if he
knows b and the result and the operation is reversible, then he can
recover a. Therefore the result contains at least as much information
unknown to the attacker (=at least as much entropy) as a did.
The point of the twisting is to spread the incoming entropy around
the pool a bit. Down at the lowest level, it uses XOR to mix so it
cannot reduce entropy, whatever the input data.
