No, it would not. If you read the POSIX.1 specification for cp
carefully <
http://www.unix.org/version3/online.html>,
 you will
notice that the process for copying a regular file is carefully
standardized. A POSIX.1-conforming cp implementation would not
be allowed to copy additional streams, unless either additional
options are given or the type of the file being copied is other
than S_IFREG. And cp is just one example of a standardized file
handling program.
