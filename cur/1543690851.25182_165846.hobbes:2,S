I like all of these ideas.
One thing to keep in mind is that during a real OOM condition, we cannot
allocate _any_ memory.  None. Zilch.
And that makes some things very hard.  When we start getting into things
such as complicated policies that kill nonessential services first, et
cetera... there comes a time where a lot of communication is needed
(probably with user-space).  Hard to do that with no memory.
I do like all of this, however, and want to see some different OOM
killers.
