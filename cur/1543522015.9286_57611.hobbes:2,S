Needing userspace is not the point. Userspace being so closely coupled
that I frequently need to re-compile the userspace part when I upgrade
the kernel part within a series (say 2.2) is the problem. It was the
reason, why raid-0.90 didn't make it into 2.2.12. It is possibly (one of
the) reason why pcmcia took so long as 2.4 to be included in the kernel
proper and why up to 2.2.1[23] all the users of ISDN ignored the isdn
drivers in the kernel and went for the cvs version.
Have you recompiled util-linux since 2.2.1? IMO the kernel<->userspce
interface needs settling before anything can make it into a stable
kernel. But that's only my opinion, YMMV.
