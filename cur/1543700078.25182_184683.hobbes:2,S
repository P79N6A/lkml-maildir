Hi Peter,
Thanks a lot, now it's OK differences between user-kernel space. It's a 
bit more clear...
  I guess your perfs info will be usefull... Actually, we do not need 
such high data rates, but we'll have 16 channels to drive I/O, and 
latencies will have to be very short, because there is a real-time loop 
(gesture control). I hope I can do the job without sending to much irqs 
since the real-time task has started.
Damien
