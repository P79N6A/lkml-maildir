Probably a stack overflow.  Once you hit the do_IRQ() stack overflow
detection code, you get stuck in a loop because your console output is
slow enough that you immediately get another IRQ, rinse, repeat.
I fixed this locally by adding a static jiffies counter to rate-limit
the overflow stack dump to once per 5 seconds.  If you overflow your
stack more often than that, well too bad.  At least you have a chance
to look at your console instead of the machine essentially being wedged.
