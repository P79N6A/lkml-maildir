Not at first. There is already much I can do without that, and that
requires proper setup of the card's internal memory map, which I
want to avoid until I've figured out with ATI how to make that
compatible between radeonfb, XFree/ATI, ATI binary drivers and
GATOS drivers...
I'm more interested, at first, in getting proper monitor detection
& DDC/EDID stuff and dual head & mirorring support.
