i have no problem with hardwiring it (and excluding it from the TLS
allocation/setting syscalls) - in fact i almost did it that way. The
question is, is the required descriptor format 100% the same for all APM
variants, Wine and Windows and DOS emulators? It would suck if we had a
bad descriptor and also removed the ability of Wine to trap 0x40 access.
but, couldnt APM use its own private GDT for real-mode calls, with 0x40
filled in properly? That would pretty much decouple things.
