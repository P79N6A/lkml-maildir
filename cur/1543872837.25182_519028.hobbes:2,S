OK, no problem.

I guess my arguments are that my patch fixes a bug, which gives it a
higher priority (being a userspace API bug, perhaps even 2.6.21); and
that it will want to be backported while the hrtimer patch will not, so
including the hrtimer patch first means 2 different patches to fix the
same bug.
I'm not trying to make life harder for the hrtimer patch. I will even
volunteer to forward port it on top of the restart fix, if that is an
issue.
