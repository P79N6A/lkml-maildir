Ok, I didn'd see it before - thx.

What does this actually mean (I'm no lawyer and somehow confused about it)? As 
I understand, GPL sais: 'every piece of code that relies on me, must be 
GPL'ed and therefore be available as source code', while LGPL sais: 'you may 
develop proprietary software that relies on me, but if you change me, your 
changes must be available as source code'.
I want to permit proprietary extensions *in user-space* for my 
open-source-project, that contains some device-drivers for DSP-cards, and 
partly relies on them. Does your second statement mean that as long as 
there's only source-code, it may be LGPL (and extendable), but if you *use* 
it (e.g. load the kernel-modules), everything that relies on the modules must 
be GPL?
(If this is OT, please tell me, and excuse the noise)
