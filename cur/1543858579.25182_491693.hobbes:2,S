Yes, definitely...
I see the major benefit being in the mobile, industrial and embedded systems 
arena. Perhaps this might come as a suprise to people, but a very large and 
ever growing number (perhaps even most) Linux devices don't use block devices 
for storage. Instead they use flash file systems or nfs, niether of which use 
local block devices.
It looks like RAIF gives a way to provide redundancy etc on these devices.
