	Hello Paul ,  Is the tape drive the only drive on that controller ?
 -	If it is the only drive then , I have just one suggestion
	-verify- all cables are seated correctly & -verify- that there
	is proper termination on the bus .
 -	If it is Not the only drive then ,
	Try grabbing an pci scsi card of known goodness & place the tape
	drive on that all by itself (just as a test) , making sure of
	proper termination .
	If that works then reveiw the configurations of the other
	drives/tapes/... that are on the bus causing problems .
