This seems to have solved the problem for me that when I closed my
mutt-in-rxvt, the window wasn't removed from the screen for several seconds
[1], while mutt had clearly quit. Stangely enough, I only noticed this
effect when running rxvt, and only when closing the app running in it.
Anyway, when I press 'q' in mutt now, the window closes instantly, so I'm
happy ;-)
