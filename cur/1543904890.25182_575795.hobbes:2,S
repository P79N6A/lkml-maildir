Beagle's problem is that it inspects the file contents, often far too
closely. I, too, had to uninstall it after it started indexing 40GB raw
huffyuv video files (probably treating them as text) and driving load
averages through the roof. Just watching for structure changes won't be
nearly as painful, assuming inotify can handle watching the entire
filesystem tree.
