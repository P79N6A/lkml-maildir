I must have been unclear.  I was not suggesting adding hardware.  I was 
suggesting that we could run Linux under Bochs, which is a software x86 
emulator.  Being what it is, hooks can be added to track "cpu activity" 
is it occurs within the emulator.  This is all a simulation.  The key 
idea I was suggesting was to log processor activity (of the emulator) 
and develop a viewer program which would help people visualize the activity.
Bochs already has hooks.  I could write a logger and a viewer.
