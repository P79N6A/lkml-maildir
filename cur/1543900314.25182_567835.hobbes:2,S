Thanks a lot, Jes: you're right, it probably did something useful
(though incorrectly) in 2.4, but we'd better get rid of it now.
I've Cc'ed Andrew, hoping he'll magically pick up the patch...
[PATCH] mspec_mmap don't set VM_LOCKED
mspec_mmap was setting VM_LOCKED (without adjusting locked_vm):
don't do that, it serves no purpose in 2.6, other than to mess
up the locked_vm accounting - mspec's pages won't get reclaimed
anyway.  Thanks to Dmitry Monakhov for raising the issue.
