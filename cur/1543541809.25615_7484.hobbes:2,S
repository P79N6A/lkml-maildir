# Great. So mv foo* ../barf will do what?
Exactly as it does now. "foo*" won't match the streams, because they don't
have directory entries in foo's parent directory. Consider:
foo-1
foo-2
foo-3
And the following streams exist:
foo-1:bar
foo-2:zap
foo-2:bob
"foo*" will still be matched to "foo-1" "foo-2" "foo-3", just as it is
now. Moving/renaming "foo-1" also moves/renames "foo-1:bar".
