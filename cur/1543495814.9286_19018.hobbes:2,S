  Leonard,
  This is a copy of a mail I sent a few days ago without having received any
  answer.
Hmmm.  My mail log shows no email from you arriving at my site in the last
month except for this message.  I suggest you check your logs to see if it was
really sent.
  Can you pls have a look ? This problem is still pending and solved by the
  moment with a system shutdown each 3 days. It feels that the more we keep the
  system without a shutdown the more we have this problem, but this remember me
  Window$ NT !!
  Thanks is advance.

There should be no reason that interrupts cannot be shared between the DAC960
and Adaptec drivers, but that's not a configuration I've ever tried.  In order
to look into this further, I'm going to need a more complete description of
your hardware, including motherboard, processors, chipset, and RAID subsystem.
Spontaneous hanging has been reported previously with some non-Intel chipsets,
which immediately disappeared when an Intel chipset based board was used.  I
worked on debugging one such case and we were never able to create a completely 
reliable system.
As for IPI, that's an Inter-Processor Interrupt used for signalling between
processors.
