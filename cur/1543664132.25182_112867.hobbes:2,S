use: hdparam -d1 /dev/<hdX>
to enable DMA, if it still says it cannot enable DMA.
try enabling the xfermode,which gives me the same
performace as DMA enabled.
hdparam -X<num> /dev/<hdX>
     put num greater than 32..like 33,34 etc  (for multiword DMA)
     OR  greater that 64....like 65 66 etc.   (for UltraDMA)
