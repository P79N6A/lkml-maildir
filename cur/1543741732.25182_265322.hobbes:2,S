Well to produce useful results, amlat requires Andrew's rtc-debug patch 
that modifies the rtc driver as well as traps so that timings are kept 
when the isr gets run and when the rtc device is read to track 
scheduling latencies. Also if this patch was applied the value being 
read by amlat from the rtc device would be the last interrupt time 
instead of the interrupt info that rtc normally produces. So the latency 
values being spit out are bogus, but it's good enough to exercise the rtc.
I use the rtc-debug and amlat to generate histograms of latencies which 
is what I was trying to do when I found the rtc problem the first time. 
I believe that rtc-debug/amlat is much more accurate for generating 
histograms of latencies than realfeel is because the instrumentation is 
in the kernel rather than a userspace program.
