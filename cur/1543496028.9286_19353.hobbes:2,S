This is exactly what I meant when I said that probably a whole thread
just for unlinking was overkill. This scheme that you propose seems
great.
Regarding quotas, I really don't mind if my users are over quota for
some seconds. And if they are below, well, they can surely wait ten
seconds to get the quota correct, can't they?
