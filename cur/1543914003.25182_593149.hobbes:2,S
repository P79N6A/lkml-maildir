It looks odd to me to do only differential up and down adjustments.
I would prefer read_calibration_register and write_calibration_register
access and let the userspace decide how much it wants to
increment/decrement the register.
Or - do you adjust your date also after you changed your battery
with +1567days,7h,34m,12sec instead of telling it's 11th Sept. 2007, 4:33pm ?
