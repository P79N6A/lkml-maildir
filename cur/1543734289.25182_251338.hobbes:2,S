No. First of all, I think they can be offered. Until proven
otherwise, I'll assume that the !CONFIG_MMU case is buggy.
Second of all, removal will make the !CONFIG_MMU systems
less compatible with the rest of the world. This will
mean that fewer apps can run on !CONFIG_MMU boxes. It's
same problem as "All the world's a VAX". It's better that
the apps work; an author working on a Pentium 4 Xeon is
likely to write code that relies on the fields and might
not really understand what "no MMU" is all about.
