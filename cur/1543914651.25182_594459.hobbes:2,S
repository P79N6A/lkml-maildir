Maybe it is still not perfect. Feel free to improve it. Several people
from the community, including me, already offered you help to add your
driver, reworking on the 5% of the stuff that aren't compatible with the
V4L/DVB core API design.

We can use the full 64 bits of v4l2_std_id. We just need to take some
care. 
Due to the lack of __ucmpdi2 on ppc32 architecture, with some gcc
versions, a hack were added at v4l2-common.c, that truncates it to 32
bits, at the function v4l2_norm_to_name():
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git;a=commit;h=412297d31d439ba56cd4faeb3a49a6f569f40702
So, using more than 32 bits is possible, providing that we change the
implementation of v4l2_norm_to_name() or find a way for it to work with
ppc32.
Instead of just adding a standard for each possible combination, we may
just add bits for the supported audio formats. For example, we can use
the bitmask as:
#define V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NICAM_A  ((v4l2_std_id)0x04000000)
#define V4L2_STD_AUDIO_A2_A     ((v4l2_std_id)0x08000000)
Since for all other chipsets but xc3028, all audio standards are
supported, maybe we can, instead, use a negate bitmap logic for the
non-supported audio standards. Something like:
#define V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_NICAM_A  ((v4l2_std_id)0x04000000)
#define V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_A2_A     ((v4l2_std_id)0x08000000)
And define some macros for the specific standards you need. For example:
#define V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_ALL	V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_A2_A | V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_NICAM_A
#define V4L2_STD_PAL_BG_A2 	V4L2_STD_PAL_BG | (V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_ALL & !V4L2_STD_AUDIO_NOT_A2_A)
This way, V4L2_STD_PAL_BG will mean that this PAL/BG accepts all
possible audio standards (being binary compatible), while
V4L2_STD_PAL_BG_A2_A will mean that only A2 response 'A' audio format is
supported for PAL/BG.
