You are abusing here :)
 - We already have a refcount
 - We have a field where putting a flag isn't that much of a problem
 - It can be difficult to get page refcounting right when dealing with
   such things, really.
In that case, we basically have an _easy_ way to trigger a useful BUG()
in the page free path when it's a page that should never be returned to
the pool.
Since the "PG_not_in_ram" or whatever we call it flag might be used by
swsusp or others, I suppose it could be useful.
However, I agree that if the end result is to have drivers just change
"PG_reserved" to "PG_not_in_ram" and still be bogus, then we might just
go all the way & drop the flag completely, only relying on the VMA
flags.
