Doesn't that give you any suspicion that other tools mightn't
be happy if we make this change, then?

I don't see too much complication from it. If we can actually
simplify things or make useful tuning, maybe it will be worth
doing.

Oh that's what you mean. OK, agreed there. But for the filesystems
and types of metadata that can now expect to have coherency, doing
this will break that expectation.
Again, I have no opinions either way on whether we should do that
in the long run. But doing it as a kneejerk response to braindead
rd.c code is wrong because of what *might* go wrong and we don't
know about.

Filesystems really want better control of writeback, I think.
This isn't really a consequence of the unified blockdev pagecache
/ metadata buffer cache, it is just that most of the important
things they do are with metadata.
If they have their own metadata inode, then they'll need to game
the cache for it, or the writeback code for that inode somehow
too.

Naturally. It is a writeback cache.

ext3 fsck I don't think is supposed to be run under a read/write
filesystem, so it's going to explode if you do that regardless.
