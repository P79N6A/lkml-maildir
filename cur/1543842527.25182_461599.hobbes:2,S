If it has lot of disadvantages then we should try to avoid that
mechanism.  Though I think it is okay to allow processes to be moved
around with the clear expectation that it is a very heavy operation (as
I think at least all the anon pages should be moved too along with task)
and should not be generally done.

The extra cost is probably the stack and private data segment...yes
there could be trade offs there depending on how big these segments are.
Though if there are big shared segments then that can be charged to a
single container.
