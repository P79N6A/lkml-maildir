Seems all these bug checks are fairly expensive. I can get 1%
back on system time for kernel compiles by changing BUG to 
"do {} while (0)" to make them all compile away. Profiles aren't
very revealing though ... seems to be within experimental error ;-(
I was pondering CONFIG_RUN_WILD_NAKED_AND_FREE, but maybe we can
just nail a few of the hottest path ones instead (I think you did
a couple already recently). I guess that suggestion isn't much
use without more profile data though ;-)
