yeah, but this looks quite bad from an overhead POV ... i think we can 
do alot simpler to solve X and kernel threads prioritization.

i disagree that the user 'would expect' this. Some users might. Others 
would say: 'my 10-thread rendering engine is more important than a 
1-thread job because it's using 10 threads for a reason'. And the CFS 
feedback so far strengthens this point: the default behavior of treating 
the thread as a single scheduling (and CPU time accounting) unit works 
pretty well on the desktop.
think about it in another, 'kernel policy' way as well: we'd like to 
_encourage_ more parallel user applications. Hurting them by accounting 
all threads together sends the exact opposite message.

yeah.
