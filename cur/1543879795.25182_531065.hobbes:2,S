One of the reasons I never posted my own code is that it never met its
own design goals, which absolutely included switching on the fly. I
think Peter Williams may have done something about that. It was my hope
to be able to do insmod sched_foo.ko until it became clear that the
effort it was intended to assist wasn't going to get even the limited
hardware access required, at which point I largely stopped working on
it.

I'm not sure what happened there. It wasn't a big enough patch to take
hits in this area due to getting overwhelmed by the programming burden
like some other efforts of mine. Maybe things started getting ugly once
on-the-fly switching entered the picture. My guess is that Peter Williams
will have to chime in here, since things have diverged enough from my
one-time contribution 4 years ago.
