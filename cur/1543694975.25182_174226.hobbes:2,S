I didn't end up trying Andrew's patch, but tried 2.4.23-pre7 instead.
It appears to be doing the right thing.
Free Highmem (grep HighFree /proc/meminfo) steadily dropped from 3Gig
to about 2-3 Meg and stayed there.
The dentry cache (grep dentry_cache /proc/slabinfo) climbed up to
about 500,000 and stayed there for 24 hours - much better than before
where it would often be only a few thousand and we had complaints every
night when the backups ran.
Thanks.
