Actually, this does leave one question still:  How serious is the problem?
How much would you trust a machine reporting these errors?  Most of the
machines are just performing DNS and web service (although with a pretty
high load).  The processes on the machine are are cpu and memory
intensive, but there is no critical data stored on most of the machines.
Are the machines likely to give us problems with crashing and data
corruption, or would it be safe to ignore the problem unless we started
noticing odd behavior?
