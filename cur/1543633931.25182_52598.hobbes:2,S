I'm aware that something like pci_enable_device() still is necessary, but 
I moved this part of the functionality into pci_request_*.
pci_enable_device() does the equivalent of
{ pci_assign_irq(); pci_assign_mmio(); pci_assign_io() }
where these again internally do pci_set_power_state() (and could extended 
to do whatever else necessary).
The main reason against pci_enable_device() is that it makes a smooth 
transition impossible - We cannot change pci_enable_device()'s behavior in 
a way that relies on all drivers using pci_request_*() already. And 
introducing a new function under a new name seems pointless when it can be 
hidden inside the new API as well.
What's not so nice is that it destroys the symmetry between 
pci_enable_device() and pci_disable_device(). 
But I think I have an idea for that one as well: This new API will be used
in conjunction with the new-style pci_register_driver() etc interface,
where the PCI layer knows when we call ::probe() and ::remove(). So it'd
be actually even nicer to do the pci_set_power_state() etc before
::probe() is called, and pci_disable_device after::remove() has finished
(and on ::probe() error path)
How does that sound?

Yes, makes sense. Actually currently pci_enable_device() should return
an error when the IRQ routing fails - it does so when using ACPI routing, 
but not when doing PIRQ routing, so I think that's a bug to be fixed in
arch/i386/pci/irq.c.
I decided to return an int from pci_*_irq, where < 0 means error. The 
number returned otherwise shell only be used for printk("IRQ %d", ret), 
anyway - pci_dev->irq stays opaque to the driver.
Proposed patch to follow in a minute.
