I noticed several distinct spikes with 1M samples, that blend into
smooth Erlang/gamma type distribution at 5M.  I posted some more results
to jackit-dev.  It seems like each of these would represent a common
code path out of a non-preemptible region.  I suspect the spike at 70-80
usecs is a bug in my code, from updating the histogram every 1024
cycles.  I will start posting results on the web soon, it's getting big.

It would be interesting to identify the code paths corresponding to the
other peaks.  It occurred to me that if you suspect a peak in the
histogram is related to a certain code path, you could stick a udelay in
there, and see if the spike moves up by the same amount.
