 There are strange bugs in the console layer and/or the VGA text console.
Choosing 34-line text mode results in a 30-line screen that the system
thinks has 34, with four 'hidden' lines at the bottom (on PCI TNT adapter.)
Maybe a similar thing is happening in X?
 And BTW I found a way to get lots of network devices:
  1. Load the gre tunneling driver (GRE tunnels over IP)
  2. ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre remote 127.1.1.1 local 127.0.0.1 dev lo
  3. Repeat for as many as you like... I can't make the kernel
     send packets through them but they show up on the list.
