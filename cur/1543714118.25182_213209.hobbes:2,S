i'm confused ... the bytes that got altered are no members of the pci
configuration space ... could you try to do the same tests with the
hdsp? maybe there's a register in the configuration space of the hdsp
that's getting altered as well...
... and we should try to figure out, what these registers are actually
doing ... cheers...
