Hi,
I'm seeing a strange complete server freeze/lock-up on an bi-Xeon HT
amd64 server running standard debian 2.6.22 (and before that vanilla
2.6.19.x and 2.6.20.x which exhibited the same issue).
I'm only reporting it now, since I could get a full sysrq-t only this
morning.
The symptoms are that every 5 to 7 days, the server (which acts as a MX
along with a few low traffic websites) locks-up. The ipmi watchdog is
unable to reboot the server (and doesn't even trigger, since there is no
evidence in the esmlog), the machine is still pingable. I can't ssh to
it, but I can enter my login & password on a serial console, but no
shell is started.
Pressing sysrq-t produced the trace hosted here:
http://www.daysofwonder.com/bug/crash-server1.txt.gz
It happened one time when I was connected to the server through ssh and
I could see that the load started to increase well above 100. It was
then impossible to launch new process from the command-line (and I had
to reboot manually).
It happened also last week, and the server was stuck for about 6 hours.
When I started investigating what was wrong, it slowly came back to life
(with an avg 1-min load of more than 1500, and tons of cron processes
running in parallel).
I'm not really familiar with kernel development so I can't really find
the issue in the aforementioned trace output.
What I think is that for some reason there is a race/deadlock that
finally prevents new processes to really start (which in turns produces
the high load).
What seems suspect in the aforementioned trace is:
 *) lot of processes stacktrace ends in __mod_timer+0xc3/0xd3
which seems to be this line from kernel/timer.c
415	timer->expires = expires;
416	internal_add_timer(base, timer);
-->	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&base->lock, flags);
419	return ret;
420  }
 *) lot of processes stacktrace ends in __mutex_lock_slowpath and/or zone_statistics
Anyway, I will soon reboot to a 2.6.23.x to see if that symptom
persists.
More information (config, server specs) are available on request.
I'm not subscribed to the list, so please CC: me for any anwser.
Many thanks,
