Mmmm. I'm not particularly convinced by that ... I do 5 runs for every 
benchmark and compare the results, and it seems very consistent to me. 
For kernbench, it's interesting to look at system time - but obviously
keeping an eye on elapsed time as well, particularly for things like
scheduler patches.

OK, well then you need to look at something that's not totally dominated
by gcc anyway. I know everyone hates SDET as it's "closed" but I'll try
to rerun with aim7 at some point. A real 20% improvement in throughput
is not to be sniffed at ...
