This may sound like a dumb question, but aside from code bloat, what are 
the performance issues involved in running 64-bit resources on 32-bit 
systems?  AKA, does it kill us x86 users to not have this switch, and by 
what kind of margin?  You can point if it's been said and I just haven't 
found it; I didn't see performance discussion in the last submission.
Thanks!
