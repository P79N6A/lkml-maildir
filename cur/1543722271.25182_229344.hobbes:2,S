[PATCH] I2C i2c-piix: Don't treat ServerWorks servers as Laptops
I'm sending you this little obvious patch which should enable i2c-piix
to work on IBM servers with ServerWorks chipsets. It still will treat
any IBM/Intel machine as a laptop and refuse to work, but it's better
than before.
  i2c: Treat only IBM machines with Intel chipsets as IBM laptops.
