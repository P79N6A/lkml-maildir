Ahem... I'm not sure that I've parsed it right. For inode pool it may make
sense. For separately allocated pieces - no way. Inodes are *way* too fat
right now. IMHO we should have two different beasts - VFS inode (generic
part) and fs-specific one (current ->u.foo_inode_info). Having a God-awful
union doesn't scale. Ever tried to look how much does fs.h suck in when it 
expands (gcc -E|wc -l)? And don't get me started on the fact that change
in ufs_fs_i.h means recompiling half of the tree. It's severely wrong. I
think that we should move to keeping fs-specific parts separate. And
free_inode_memory() looks like a reasonable place for asking icache to
look for inodes it can take away from filesystems. Maybe it should be
called by shrink_dcache() and be invisible for VM - after all, it's VFS
business what to trim and what kind of balance should be kept between
dcache, icache and fs-specific parts.
