proc/cpuinfo -> /dev/cpu/n/cpuid driver
proc/mtrr -> /dev/cpu/mtrr if devfs is around, but given thats not the
 common case, there is no alternative.

In most cses, yes. However this is not going to stay the same forever..
1. hotplug CPUs
2. speedscaling work like cpufreq
3. enabling/disabling of features by poking /dev/cpu/n/msr is possible, and
   cpuinfo should reflect that (but currently doesn't)
