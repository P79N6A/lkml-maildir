btw, it's sd-0.39, isn't?
Hum... according to Con's "priority matrix" table, a nice 19 task can
run only one priority slot per major rotation and this slot is fixed
(20). So I'd expect "top" showing the same value in "PR" for all the
tasks with "NI" == 19 and this is not a case in your case (see an
excerpt from your output below).
Either I'm still missing something important or there is something
fishy here.. will try to look at the code a bit later.
tasks with NI==19 show different "PR"s
