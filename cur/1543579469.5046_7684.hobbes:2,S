AFAIK as long as that dummy page struct is only used in the page cache,
that should work, but you get new problems as soon as you map the page
also into a user process (grep for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM under
include/asm-mips64 to see the needed changes). In the worst case one
might need reverse mapping to get the page back. :)

I hope I have soon the time to experiment with this, so I'll now for sure.
I don't see major problems, except I don't know yet, how the performance
will be.
