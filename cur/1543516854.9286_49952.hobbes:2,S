Hi. I have another update for the Linux 32-bit UID support patches. These
patches are against the latest development kernel version.
(pre-patch-2.3.29-3)
This patch includes more IPC changes, and a "final" proposal for new
msqid_ds, semid_ds, and shmid_ds structures. Now there is padding space
available on all platforms for:
	32-bit pid_t
	64-bit time_t
	32-bit mode_t
	32-bit 'seq' in ipc_perm
	32-bit or 64-bit message sizes for message queues
The ipc_perm structure is now also broken out architecture-by-architecture
into include/asm-[arch]/ipc.h, along with the msqid_ds, semid_ds, and
shmid_ds structures.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991123b/
Changes in this version:
	- struct ipc_perm is now broken out on an architecture-by-
	  architecture basis, pad space is now included for a 32-bit
	  mode_t and seq on all architectures.
	- include/asm-m68k/shm.h file was clobbered by previous patch;
	  now fixed
	- sem_perm.seq field now copied properly by semctl() and
	  IPC_OLDSTAT, SEM_OLDSTAT
As always, the patches are tested and working on i386.
In order to use 32-bit UIDs you need the following patches from the above
URL:
	linux-acct.patch
	linux-arch-independ.patch
	linux-ext2.patch
	linux-ipc.patch
	linux-filesystems.patch
as well as a patch for your particular architecture:
	linux-alpha.patch
	linux-arm.patch
	linux-i386.patch
	linux-m68k.patch
	linux-mips.patch
	linux-ppc.patch
	linux-sh.patch
	linux-sparc.patch
	linux-sparc64.patch
Still broken with these patches:
	- sparc64 architecture.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
