Hi,
Sorry it took a while for me to get you feedback on this patch.  I have 
just applied this patch against 2.6.7-rc2 (some fuzz and some offset - I 
can get you details if you would like).  It exhibits exactly the same 
symptoms as before - ie. certain CDs will cause the "kernel: cdrom: 
dropping to single frame dma", and all ripping form that point on until 
reboot will just rip to silence (I have one test case that does it 75% 
of the way through track 4, as regular as clockwork, but several other 
do to, and some even appear not to do it all the time - physically the 
CD is in good shape and rips fine using Win32 ripping tools on my laptop).
My next guess is that this is a hardware problem, though I'd appreciate 
your feedback on whether that patch should have fixed or not.
Thanks again for all your help on this,
Phil
