This seems to be same kind of a problem I'm having.
I noticed you're not using sw-raid nor the HPT366-driver (which I
suspected). I also tried disabling the IRQ sharing from the ide devices,
changed ide disks to be masters on their own bus and used hdparm on
disks to have very basic configuration options but no success on
eliminating the fault.

My motherboard is the same / at least with the same chipset.
