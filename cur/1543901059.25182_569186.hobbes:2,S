it's only ext3 that has this bug when mounting a fileystem read-only 
AFAIK.

another reason to go ahead and make a dedicated no-module kernel for the 
hibernate phase ;-)

with swap space you have two options
1. free it up (to a swap file if needed) and don't worry about it
2. try and ensure that nothing else on the system attempts to use the swap 
partition until you reboot.
#2 is failure prone, #1 would be more reliable.
