Sounds good to me.  Ben Herrenschmidt has tested this patch on PPC Cell,
accessing SPU memory and Adam Jackson has tested it on x86, accessing
video memory with gdb attached to an X server.
Considering the recent amount of change in the ioremap code upstream,
having this patch live in -mm for a few weeks is probably a good idea.

We already have _HAVE_ARCH* too.  I copied the convention from the
first definition I ran into.

No kidding.

If you feel strongly about having this as CONFIG_ARCH_IOREMAP_PROT I can
send you an incremental patch to do things that way.  Just let me know.

It's pretty close, yeah.  Not quite the same though :(

On PAE I think that pte_pfn() returns an unsigned long, which cannot be
left shifted by PAGE_SHIFT. After assigning that value to a resource_size_t
(which is 64 bit on PAE) we can safely do the shift.
I can remove the question mark if you want.

Well, they also need to implement pgprot_val and pte_pgprot.  As for the ioremap
declarations, I just placed them near the others, none of the function declarations
for ioremap() itself are in include/linux/io.h.
