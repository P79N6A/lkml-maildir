FWIW,
	I saw keyboard lockups with 2.2.12 on my old Digital Laptop
when kbd_read_status() was called too quickly, too many times in a row. 
Look at the while loop in "handle_kbd_event(void)". The ps2 status
register can really be hammered. 
By adding an "mdelay(1);" before the second  "status = kbd_read_status();",
everything works fine. 
That may just mask another issue, but it fixed my problem. ;-)
