Having spent a quarter century in which cleaning up after other sysadmins
has played a major role, I think you're vastly overstating the average clue level
out there.
Most of the readers of this list can (hopefully) snarf a linux-2.foo.tar.bz2
and end up with a bootable kernel on their own.  The *actual* average sysadmin
out there has trouble getting something like 'up2date' (or the Ubuntu equivalent)
to update an already vendor-compiled kernel.
Experience has shown that if you make the sysadmin configure it using anything
more than 1 or 2 very broad knobs ("fairly secure, very secure, tinfoil-hat secure"),
it *very* quickly becomes a way for them to create security holes in their system,
and doesn't add any actual security.
And the instant you abstract it all behind a point-and-drool GUI with a choice
of 3 buttons to click, it doesn't matter anymore, because the distro vendor
will be doing all the heavy lifting.
