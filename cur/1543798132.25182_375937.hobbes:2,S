hi,
    I'm trying to write ethernet driver.I need some explaination on
ENDEC port and MII interface.By googling i've come to know that MII is
used for phy communication by modern ethernet cards,but i haven't
found much info on  ENDEC ports.
Actually mine card has option to select ENDEC port or MII interface
for transmit and recieve.
Please tell me  which one should i choose and why.
