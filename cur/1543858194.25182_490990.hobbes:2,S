If file "foo" exists on the server, and contains data, then something
like
fd = open("foo", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, "1", 1);
should never need to trigger a read. That's a fairly common workload
when you think about it (happens all the time in apps that do random
write).

What is the generic problem you are trying to resolve? I saw something
fly by about a reader filling the !uptodate page while the writer is
updating it: how is that going to happen if the writer has the page
locked?
AFAIK the only thing that can modify the page if it is locked (aside
from the process that has locked it) is a process that has the page
mmapped(). However mmapped pages are always uptodate, right?
