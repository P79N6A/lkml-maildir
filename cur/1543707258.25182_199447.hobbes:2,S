Just upgraded an old computer from 2.4.18 to 2.4.24. The system has 24M 
ram, but the bios reports only 16.
Discovered that mem=24M doesn't let Linux use all of it, like in 2.4.18, 
only 16M in 2.4.24.
mem=8M@16M has the desired result, making the whole incredibly large 24M 
ram available :-)
RTFSing leads me to believe that mem=xxxM can only limit ram size, but 
Documentation/memory.txt and Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt make 
me think ram=24M should work like it did in 2.4.18.  I'm guessing 
nobody updated the documentation? :)
