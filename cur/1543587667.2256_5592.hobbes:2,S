Ok, I've gotten both NICs to work thanks to the help from you guys.
Basically, what you have to do is disable all the packet filtering stuff
with exception to the minimal requirements to select ipchains. And also
I disabled modular install and built in install for every nic card but
the ones I had. (aka, clicking a bunch of options, rebooting and linux
loading.)
Note: Just in case anyone else comes around asking about 2000 smbfs
mounting, it works with 2.4.3. Before (or in version 2.2.16 and
earlier... Not sure when it was fixed) there use to be this bug with
mounting 2000 shares. Changes to the drive and files wouldn't be
updated, just reloaded from the cache.
Thanks for the help,
   Matt
