I think if you solve the lookup issue (which you seem to have) and this
you will be in good shape.

Both are useful tests. Benchmarking typically doesnt factor in realistic
- the rule of thumb being if you can win a benchmark you can do better.
The exception is when you make complex changes to win a benchmark; there
has to be a balance.

I think the methodology was fine enough for what you were doing then;
academic time constraints apply and you can be forgiven for that ;->
Now that you have gone beyond academia and have some company behind your
work, it is only fair to compare against tc filter because it is in the
kernel and being used by some people. 
I am willing to help consult for the tc filter side if you need help.
