CONFIG_HIGHIO and CONFIG_2GB improved dbench throughput on ext2, 
ext3, and reiserfs. I compared 4 2.4.19-pre9-aa2 kernel configs 
on a quad Xeon with 3.75 GB ram.
dbench 192 improved more than dbench 64.
ext3 improved 35-65% with these options. 
ext2 improved 27-35%.
reiserfs improved 17-30%.
dbench summary is at:

For sequential reads, HIGHIO and 2GB tiobench has increased
throughput and lower cpu utilization.  tiobench sequential write 
performance in some cases is lower.
