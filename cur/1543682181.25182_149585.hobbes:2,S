I have just started stress testing a 8way OSDL box to see if I can
reproduce the problem. I'm using pre6+axboes BH_Sync patch.
I'm running 50 dbench clients on aic7xxx (ext2) and 50 dbench clients on
DAC960 (ext3). Lets see what happens.
After lunch I'll keep looking at the oopses. During the morning I only had
time to setup the OSDL box and start the tests.
