I applied an older version, maybe rc7 or so, without issues. It may have 
bitched about the Makefile, can't remember, I sometimes add my own patch 
level infor for local fixes.
BTW: to build allmodconfig 2.6.21 the sd-0.46 was marginally faster in 
real time. Perhaps down in the noise, I'm getting ready to boot and test 
the x86_64 version.
