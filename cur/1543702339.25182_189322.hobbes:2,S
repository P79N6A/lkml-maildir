gcc does indeed complain about it with -W.  But -W turns on so many other
warnings, this one's lost in the noise.  I would actually like to be
able to make the header files -W clean so that I can compile individual
files with -W to catch some of my worst mistakes.
But I don't think that making the entire build -W clean is worthwhile.
It'd make the code too ugly.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
