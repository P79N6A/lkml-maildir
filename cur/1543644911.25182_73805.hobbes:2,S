The pagebuf layer presents and inferface similar enough to the IRIX
buffercache to XFS and is layered ontop of the Linux pagecache.  Today
it's only used for metadata and allows mapping of > PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
objects there (see the vmap/vunmap code I added to vmalloc.c in 2.5
for that).  But it's not used for data I/O at all anymore and it would
also have problems for blocksize > PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.
