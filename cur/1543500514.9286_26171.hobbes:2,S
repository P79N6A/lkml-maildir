I'm currently working on a writing project that will discuss, among
other things, the Linux kernel developers' reputation for fixing 
reported bugs very quickly.  
Trying to nail down examples is a little harder than I expected.  
I would like to cite several concrete, verifiable examples, along the 
lines of, "on Feb. 10, 1999 a security bug was found in component 
X, and a fix was coded, tested, and made available on the Internet 
within 24 hours."
I can't go into details, but this project is high enough profile that it
could help Linux a lot to have this information included.  This also 
means that citing a false example could do more harm to Linux than 
citing no examples at all, so anything I say has to be 100% accurate.
Pls. copy all responses to me at lgrinzo@stny.lrun.com
Thanks in advance.
Lou
