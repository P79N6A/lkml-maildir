reply->all works wonderful.
It's not proper to replace the header and advised against as a common practice.  Adding a reply-to is also advised against but is somewhat 50/50 in practical use.  Clients are suggested to use their reply-to-all
feature instead.  Normally you get both the sender and the list.
