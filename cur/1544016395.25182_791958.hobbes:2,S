I updated the git://linux-arm.org/linux-2.6.git kmemleak branch to the
latest mainline and it works fine. However, I tried to merge it with the
linux-next tree and there are many conflicts with kmemtrace as they both
modify similar areas of the kernel. The conflicts are relatively simple
but they still need manual fixing.
Are you OK with applying patches to linux-next (git am) rather than
using git merge? This way I can rebase kmemleak on top of linux-next.
Thanks.
