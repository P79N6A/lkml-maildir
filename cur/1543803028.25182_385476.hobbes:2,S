Subject: fix-processing-of-obsolete-style-setup-options breaks UML arg parsing

UML has a bunch of parameters styled on the hd<n>= and ide<n>=
parameters which depend on matching a prefix of the command-line
argument.  This patch explicitly removes this prefix matching.
I know that this has "obsolete" written all over it, but I don't see
any more modern replacement which allows prefix matching.
module_param seems to be the more modern thing, but AFAICS, it is
matching entire command-line arguments.  Strangely, it will match when
the command-line argument is a prefix of the in-kernel parameter
string, which seems exactly backwards.
The hd<n>= and ide<n>= switches are still present, in ide_setup, using
the old mechanism, and they now seem to be broken as well.
