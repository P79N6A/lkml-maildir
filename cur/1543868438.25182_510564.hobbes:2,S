I will send Build stuff as the last patch next time, thanks, point
taken.
I just used different concept: one looks at declaration and the overall
picture becomes clear because _there is_ documentation. One does not
look at the implementation to grasp picture on surface.
But your point is fair. I assume _programmers_ look in .c first. Users
may always generate a pdf. I will do what you advise.
May be a good compromise would be to have just brief comments at
headers, and full specification at .c. I will think about this, thanks.

Why not? Some stuff may probably be merged. _Specific_ advices are
welcome.

Well... I do not want any flame on this topic. It is about taste,
trade-offs, compromises. It is difficult to provide _objective_ and
killing arguments here. But I will think on this, point taken, thanks.
