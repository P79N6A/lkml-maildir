What different options are there to capture the kernel oops 
messages besides the pen and paper method. Is there for instance 
a method for capturing kernel oopses during boot (happened to me 
one whenever starting init), maybe over a network. I have read the 
docs (mostly ;-) and didn't find any information on such a setup. I 
would be glad to learn more, since that is what i am here for!
