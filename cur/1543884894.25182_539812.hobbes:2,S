  i'm guessing it's to hide the underlying implementation of
extracting the major/minor numbers from an inode, in case that
implementation ever changes, which strikes me as perfectly reasonable.
and i don't think you'd have any luck arguing that it should be
removed at this point:
$ grep -Erw "(imajor|iminor)" * | wc -l
350
  all i was doing was standardizing the small handful of holdouts.
