Hi
I wanted to copy some Floppy-Images back to floppy and i wanted to burn
some CD-Images.
Alone both things work flawlessly. If done at the same time the system
locks up hard. (Tested with 2.4.4 & 2.4.9)
"Short" Summary of system:
Dual PIII-933Mhz, Severworks HE-SL Chipset, 3GB-RAM
Data-HDD, DTLA 307045 (Here were the CD-Images)
5 Channel ICP-Vortex GDTH-6550
  Channel1: 2xPioneer 304 (Here were the Floppy-Images)
  Channel2-5: 1xTeac CD-R58S each
If more information is needed, i will provide them.
Bis denn
