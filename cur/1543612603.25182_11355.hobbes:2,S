I'm not sure that's any less vomitworthy. 
Keeping things simple that users and/or sysadmins have to deal with is a 
Good Thing (tm). I'd have the complexity in the kernel, where complexity 
is pushed to the kernel developers, thanks.

No it's not that far off topic, my point is that you're shifting the complexity 
problems to other areas (eg. system mangement / the application level / 
filesystems / scheduler load balancing) rather than solving them.
