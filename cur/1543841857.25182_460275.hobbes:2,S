FWIW, e100 seems to work okay for me on an intel ixp2400 (xscale based)
board, an ixp2850 (xscale based) board and an ixp2350 (xscale3 based)
board.  ixp2350 works both with hardware coherency turned on (cpu
snoops bus) and turned off (manual dma cache clean/invalidate as usual.)
As for the other ARM platforms that I'm interested in / have hardware
for / maintain, the at91/ep93xx/pxa270 don't have PCI, and the other
two (iop32x/iop33x) I can't test because I don't have such systems with
e100 NICs, but I expect those would work, since they're both xscale
based like the ixp2400, and the ixp2400 works.
cheers,
Lennert
