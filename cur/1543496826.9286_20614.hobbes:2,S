This may be true for some implementations, but not XFS. It uses
multiple trees for FS resource management, so every CPU can just grab
one of the trees and go ahead. SGI does have some nice SMP machines,
and they are aware of the problems with that.

As long as SGI shows neither code nor license, this point is moot
anyways. But XFS scores pretty well for a jounaling file system, or
just about any Unix file system currently available.
