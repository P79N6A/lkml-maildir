Jens, where is the problem? This should have absolutely zero impact on
"interesting" code, making only changes to initialization and
suspend/resume...

All processes capable of generating requests are safely stopped, so no
request should get down to drivers. That's why I simply BUG_ON(), not
block or anything more sophiscated. It should never ever happen.

High levels are stopped, so there are no new requests coming.
What is needed in idedisk_suspend is to make sure that no requests are
"in flight". DMA scribbling over random memory is not good thing.
idedisk_suspend then sends drive to standby to make sure writeback
caches are flushed.
as ls120s and zips... If they are DMA capable, they badly need
support. If not, they should not kill rest of the system during
suspend-to-disk, but still support would be nice.
