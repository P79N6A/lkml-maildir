Yes, this is what I tried.  I enabled unmasking.  This also did not help.
Also, each time the ppp stops working, the error counter in "ifconfig ppp0"
increments.
The same problem is present on my home system, an AMD K6/SIS desktop
running 2.2.0 and Debian Slink.
I'm going to try running a straight login with minicom and see if I still
get the "timeouts" or whatever they are called.  I imagine I will.
One thing:  I have the serial port speed set for PPP to 38400 since this
was as fast as 2.0.36 would connect.  I wonder if this is related?  I'll
try that, too, and report back.
Is there any debug info I can gather to help people figure this out?
Stephen
