That is a deliberate part of the new interrupt balancing code.
If the interrupt rate is low, it is better to keep all the interrupt
processing code and data in the cache of a single CPU.
It is only if that CPU starts to run out of steam that it is worthwhile
taking the hit of getting other CPUs to service interrupts as well.
(I think.  At least, it sounds good and the benchmarks came out well).
