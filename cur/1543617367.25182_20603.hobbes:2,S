Some implementation-specific details people may find useful:
* For 4.xx versions of Netscape Mail, with standard mime types/prefs,
sending patches by MIME attachment results in a readable text/plain
message.
* The best way to mail patches is to pipe a header, patch description,
and contents to "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t" or some other MTA.  When I spam
Linus or Marcelo with patches, my process looks like this:
1) create outgoing patches
2) change e-mail header template to reflect current kernel version
3) put template and blank space at top of each patch
4) "vi *.patch", manually insert descriptions and CC list from
MAINTAINERS
5) review each patch and description once again :)
6) pipe *.patch individually through "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"
Here is the mail header template I use.  Sendmail is smart and will
insert all other headers like message-id and date, since they are not
present.  When using another MTA, make sure yours does this too.

As always, read Documentation/SubmittingPatches.  That's what it's there
for.
