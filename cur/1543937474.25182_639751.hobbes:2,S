Ah, okay.  I couldn't find anything about MFGPTs in the available
source, but I did find the following:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.distributions.voyage.general/1824
It would appear that something between 0.90 and 0.92 changed that
has broken things.  There's also a changelog here:
http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=6729.15
Note two MFGPT-related entries in 0.92:
	- disable CS5536 diverse device power management to avoid
MFGPT /
	  interrupt issues.
	- MFGPT issues: please observe AMD CS5536 data book section
5.16.3,
	  incorrect initialization sequence can HANG the system.
I'm assuming the first is messing w/ DIVIL_GLD_MSR_PM...
