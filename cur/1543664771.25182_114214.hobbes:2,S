I'm probably missing something obvious but it's not clear to me how to
extract the changeset info from this format.
Let's assume I want to extract this changeset:
hangeSet@1.1021, 2003-02-24 10:49:30-08:00, randy.dunlap@verizon.net
  [PATCH] convert /proc/io{mem,ports} to seq_file
  This converts /proc/io{mem,ports} to the seq_file interface
  (single_open).
How can I?
I mean, the above format is fine, as far as we have a file like that per
changeset (or alternatively per Linus's merge, even if not for every
single changeset, when he does the pulls). Clearly a file of that format
for a 2.5.62->63 diff is not finegrined enough.
Correct me if I'm wrong but if I understand well the changeset numbers
aren't fixed in the bitkeeper tree, a changeset number can change while
the merging happens across different cloned trees. So in short, the
changeset numbers are useless to the outside (but still providing them
won't hurt as far as nobody rely on them).

If that hurts, you could simply upload them to kernel.org.  Even if it's
not a file, can't you simply checkin into a remote cvs on kernel.org or
osdl.org or sourceforge, or whatever else place, so you won't need to
pay for it. It's up to you of course, but I'm sure you're not forced to
pay for this service (besides for the once-a-time setup of the exports,
that I hope won't generate any maintainance overhead to you).

Yes, as far as this file-format is per-merge I think this is all we
need. This way it will be usable to checkout, browse and regenerate the
tree, unlike the cset directory currently in kernel.org.

Just curious, this also means that at least around the 80% of merges
in Linus's tree is submitted via a bitkeeper pull, right?
