I still get this in the dmesg (2 modules won't load - most of rest are fine)
Module len 6897 truncated
Module len 19014 truncated
However, at least now modprobe manages not to hose up the entire modules stuff, but
simply exits with this error:
FATAL: Error inserting aes (/lib/modules/2.6.1-mm1/kernel/crypto/aes.ko): Invali
d module format
and lsmod and 'cat /proc/modules' don't get borked up afterwards.

Sent under separate cover, the list probably doesn't want the 2 .ko files.. ;)
