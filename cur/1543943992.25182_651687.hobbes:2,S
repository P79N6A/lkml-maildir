Maybe this helps a bit: later I found that something similar occurs in 
drivers/parisc/{ccio-dma.c, sba_iommu.c}:
1010: .alloc_consistent =     ccio_alloc_consistent,
      .alloc_noncoherent =    ccio_alloc_consistent,
1036: .alloc_consistent =     sba_alloc_consistent,
      .alloc_noncoherent =    sba_alloc_consistent,
However in these files the functions {ccio_alloc, sba_alloc}_noncoherent
do not exist.
