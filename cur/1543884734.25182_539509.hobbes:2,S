I can certainly send compile warnings and dmesg and whatever you need.
But at first I need another link WHERE I can download the actual cx878 code.
Is it thaddathil.net or where the hell has it gone?
Just send me one link please, otherwise I do not have any chance to help you, OK?

Hi Manu,
But it would be an acceptable compromise FOR NOW, wouldn't it?
So please don't turn your back on it, even if it may be incomplete for your needs.
Just add your SOB and then focus on cx878 with full power, OK?
Anything else would be terrible in pschological terms, you know?
Just think about Trent, Markus, me, so many others, you know.
Do I expect too much? Hope I do not!
Plus:
If I should help you it would be a pleasure for me if you could offer an acceptable time window that fulfills the following aims:
a. not to exhaust or threaten or bug you or nerve you (noone wants that, you know)
b. give me and others a feeling for when things of whatever issue are done and resolved, you know.
So at least for me it's very hard to continue if the whole thing looks like a never ending story, you know? So please give us a chance. And please do better this time.
Just learn and develop, you know.
And be more transparent and eloquent this time, but do not crawl back into a snail house, OK?
Waiting for your link meanwhile to download that hopeful project...
CCing some other persons who are perhaps interested in this....
Yours sincerely
Uwe
