Yeah, I forgot about those.  I'll respin against your consolidation stuff.

Maybe, we haven't figured out the best way to schedule on a 512p yet, but most 
or all of this code is generic.  In order for things to work at all though, 
we'll need to change some of the SD_NODE_INIT values, maybe we can keep that 
as per-arch?
