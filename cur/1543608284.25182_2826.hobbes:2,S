Which kernel ? Linus 2.4.13 or one of the PPC bk trees ?
I've been using 2.4.13 from bk _devel on a dual G4 for some
time now, it just worked. I'm away from my dev. machines for
a few days, but I'll look into this problem as soon as I'm
back.
gcc 3.0.2 isn't ready for ppc kernel compiles afaik. I'm
personally still using 2.95.4 from debian "sid".
Ben.
