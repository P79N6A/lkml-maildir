Nice. (of course if the old ksymoops did the same, your really not the 
guilty one :)
I haven't heard anything about the oops. In case anyone is wondering I
couldn't repeat it on 2.2.3-pre3 (not pre1 as I wrote). This may of course
be pure bad luck.
The cause btw was a "misconfigured" database that became too large for the
small machine (and the limited remaining disk space for temporary rollback
logfiles). With 2.2.3-pre3 things didn't stop working. They just became a
little slower. Excellent.
/Urban, watching too many reruns of bbc's "the fast show" :)
