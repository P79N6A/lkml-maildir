Could you add the warning again? I doubt that md is the only place which
relies on the cli()+sleep_on(), eg drivers/block/floppy.c looks
suspicious:

testing and setting fdc_busy is not atomic.
[What about disallowing schedule(), sleep_on() with the global irq lock
held? It's only a band-aid for old drivers, and I'm sure that 90% of
these drivers contain races on SMP, ie I would prefer a clean oops
instead an unexplainable bug report - at least until 2.4pre]
