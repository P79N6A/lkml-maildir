these are very simple 1 line things, and are the cases where inline is
just fine. The problem cases are the ones with a whole lot more than
that though, say 3 or more real code lines with things like loops or
udelays or ... There's 50+ line functions marked "inline". Those are the
"bad guys" not so much the simple 1 liners

I proposed the following chunks:
Adds a bit of text to Documentation/Codingstyle to state that
inlining everything "just because" is a bad idea

+There appears to be a common misperception that gcc has a magic "make me
+faster" ricing option called "inline". While the use of inlines can be
+appropriate (for example as a means of replacing macros, see Chapter 11), it
+very often is not. Abundant use of the inline keyword leads to a much bigger
+kernel, which in turn slows the system as a whole down, due to a bigger
+icache footprint for the CPU and simply because there is less memory
+available for the pagecache. Just think about it; a pagecache miss causes a
+disk seek, which easily takes 5 miliseconds. There are a LOT of cpu cycles
+that can go into these 5 miliseconds.
+
+A reasonable rule of thumb is to not put inline at functions that have more
+than 3 lines of code in them. An exception to this rule are the cases where
+a parameter is known to be a compiletime constant, and as a result of this
+constantness you *know* the compiler will be able to optimize most of your
+function away at compile time. For a good example of this later case, see
+the kmalloc() inline function.
+
+Often people argue that adding inline to functions that are static and used
+only once is always a win since there is no space tradeoff. While this is
+technically correct, gcc is capable of inlining these automatically without
+help, and the maintenance issue of removing the inline when a second user
+appears outweighs the potential value of the hint that tells gcc to do
+something it would have done anyway.
