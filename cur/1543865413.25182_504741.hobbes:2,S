I almost forgot. Currently this smp_mb__after_atomic_inc() is not strictly
needed, and the comment is correct. However, it becomes mandatory with your
optimization. Without this barrier, it is possible that both checks above
mutex_lock() will see the result of atomic_dec(), but not the atomic_inc().
So, may I ask you to also update this comment?
	/*
	 * Reduce the likelihood that qrcu_read_lock() will loop
	 *	AND
	 * make sure the second re-check above will see the result
	 * of atomic_inc() if it sees the result of atomic_dec()
	 */
Something like this, I hope you will make it better.
And another note: this all assumes that STORE-MB-LOAD works "correctly", yes?
We have other code which relies on that, should not be a problem.
