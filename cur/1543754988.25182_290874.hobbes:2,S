Yes, it was from some days ago... so I guess either I or Jeff will have to

Andrew, when do you plan to release 2.6.11?
Jeff, you should send your queued fixes, and also resend this one (indeed, it

send them (with a mail to request their prompt merge).

Ok, please merge it ASAP (as the title suggests).
