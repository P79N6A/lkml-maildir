In a previous email, you said you were using ext3. If that's the case,
there doesn't appear to be much going on in terms of patches between
2.6.20 and 2.6.21-rc1. The only one that even comes close to looking
like it might have an effect would only come in to play if you have a
filesystem that has ACL information, but is mounted by a kernel that
doesn't have ACL support.
I have to echo wli here, I'm afraid, and recommend at least a *few*
bisections to help narrow down the list of suspect patches.
There are tutorials out there for git users. I use the mercurial
repository, as I find the mercurial interface and workflow a lot more
intuitive, but it has the same capability.
Even 2-5 bisections will greatly help others hunt the bug down.
