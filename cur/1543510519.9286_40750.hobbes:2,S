Yes, I know. I even had a patched version of isdn_net.c running
where the tbusy handling was fixed (only set when busy condition 
was detected). The problem by this time was that due the occasional hangs
(which, as we know now, were caused by the packet scheduler) I could never
be sure that the changed code was actually correct. And as the tbusy handling
changes did not fix the hangs (and on the other hand there was a risk
that I missed something in the complex isdn_net), I decided not
to commit the change until the ping-delay problem was actually resolved.

Thus, you think that it is rather worthy to resurrect my old patch,
otherwise isdn is likely to break in 2.3.x ?
