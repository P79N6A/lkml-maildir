Subject: [PATCH] quota: Turn quotas off when remounting read-only
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Turn off quotas before filesystem is remounted read only. Otherwise quota will
try to write to read-only filesystem which does no good... We could also just
refuse to remount ro when quota is enabled but turning quota off is consistent
with what we do on umount.
