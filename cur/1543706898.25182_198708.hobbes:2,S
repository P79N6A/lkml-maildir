Not locale, but normalization problems and identical-glyph problems.
Which is actually worse, because you don't have filenames which look
like crap -- instead you have filenames which look perfectly sane, but
they still do not work. Example: is an á one character, or is it an a
followed by a composing ´?
Mac OSX, just as an example, only uses decomposed filenames. I don't know
the current situation, but 10.2 has major problems when you try to access
files with composite characters in their name (across NFS for instance).
I wonder if Linux, i.e. Linus ;-) should decree one single standard
normalization. (I am NOT saying that enforcing this would be the kernel's
job!)
