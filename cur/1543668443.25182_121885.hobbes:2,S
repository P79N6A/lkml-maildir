I've tried every kernel I could get to build up through 2.5.66 and nothing 
changed.  Same behavior every time
Also, I can get them all to boot into single user mode.  I'm going to check
if the hang is caused by the loading of the alsa modules (which run on the
same interrupt) or something else.
: Try >= 2.5.64.  It has a derive_pci_id ACPI patch that fixed this problem
: for me[*].
