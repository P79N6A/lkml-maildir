No, unfortunately.  Implementing kmalloc_mask() and kmalloc_dev() was
something I said I'd do ... about two years ago.

It should, I believe ... x86_64 has a complex allocation scheme where
for masks < 32 bit it first tries in GFP_DMA32 and sees if it gets lucky
before falling back to GFP_DMA. i386 just goes straight to GFP_DMA.
