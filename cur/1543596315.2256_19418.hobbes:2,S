Correct. Linux always enables the APIC, but it needs some bios tables
for the IO APIC. And the IO APIC is not present on all uniprocessor
motherboards.

Figure out which ICH is used (lspci?), then check Intel's documentation.
But even if an io apic is present, Linux can only use it if a MP table
is present. Afaik ACPI tables are not yet supported on i386, but ia64
already supports detecting the IO APIC's based on ACPI tables.
