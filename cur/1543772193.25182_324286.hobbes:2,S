found the bug - it was the incorrect initialization of 
debug_slock/rwlock. I've uploaded -48-02 with the fix. This release also 
includes a new debugging feature: CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP, which works 
similar to the NMI watchdog but detects soft (==no reschedules) lockups.  
I've also converted a few more local_irq_*() calls to raw_local_irq_*() 
calls.
