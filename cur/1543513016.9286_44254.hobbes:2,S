I think the reason: to use only one tool

However, if the GAS is so buggy while handling 16-bit code
it was not, IMHO, the right moment to do as86->GAS conversion.

It seems to be correct.

It also seems to be correct.

Does it mean that GAS has problems in 32-bit mode ?

Does this problem appear in all versions of GAS (binutils) or has already
been corrected ?
