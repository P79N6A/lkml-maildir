man ipchains
       -S, --set tcp tcpfin udp
              Change the timeout values used for masquerading.  This 
              command always takes 3  parameters, representing  the
              timeout values (in seconds) for TCP sessions, TCP sessions
              after receiving a FIN packet, and UDP packets, respectively.  
              A timeout value 0 means that the current timeout  value  of
              the  corresponding entry is preserved.  This option is only
              allowed in combination with the -M flag.
