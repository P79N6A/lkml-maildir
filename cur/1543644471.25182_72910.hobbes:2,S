OK - "test WP failed" is harmless (unless there are read-only CF
cards...), but it would still be nice to track down that bug as it
might affect other devices (those that require MODE_XLATE).
In the meantime, may I ask you nicely to add this to 2.4.20
drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h ?

UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x07c4, 0xa400, 0x0000, 0xffff,

		US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY ),
Note that this uses the normal US_PR_BULK protocol (not US_PR_DATAFAB -
tried that one too, didn't work) so this shouldn't be conditional on
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB, just always included.  It seems that newer
Datafab devices are slightly less broken^Wunusual than the old ones ;)
I say "Datafab" because the name "Sagatek" (
http://www.sagatek.com.tw/
)
appears only on the packaging.  There is a Datafab chip inside, and
"KECF-USBG" is actually printed on the PCB inside...
Thanks,
Marek
