The real issue with removing OSS from a stable kernel is that a kernel 
update should not break existing system software (at least compliant 
software). As of early 2.6 it seemed that you had to update to the ALSA 
mixer and {something I don't remember} if you used the OSS emulation. I 
just used OSS and it worked. Based on only two systems, so it may not apply.
Stable and install new sound software don't seem to mix well. I suggest 
that the current course is a good one, keep both systems in the stable 
kernel.
