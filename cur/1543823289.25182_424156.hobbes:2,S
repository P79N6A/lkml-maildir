The test machine I have is this:
# lspci -v -s 7.1
0000:00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01) (prog-if 80 [Master])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
        I/O ports at 10a0 [size=16]
# lspci -v -s 7.1 -n
0000:00:07.1 0101: 8086:7111 (rev 01) (prog-if 80 [Master])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
        I/O ports at 10a0 [size=16]

If this won't work, let me know.
