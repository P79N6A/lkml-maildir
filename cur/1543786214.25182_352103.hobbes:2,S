So what you're saying is that we should optimise the code so that
we make mistakes when we modify it.  Umm, yes, of course.
This is a contentious issue, and I don't think anyone should be

has been done by placing it in Coding Style.  Remember, we have
kernel janitors who _will_ change code to match that.
