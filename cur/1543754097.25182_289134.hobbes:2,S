Ahh, indeed. When I compiled this function, it kept 0x28(%edx) in a 
register. Your config/compiler combination does not, so there actually is 
a race condition if somebody changes the function pointer.

Don't worry, it clearly shows that it's at least possible, and worth 
looking at. 
For testing, a patch like this might get rid of the problem by hiding the
race (but for all I know, gcc ends up re-loading it anyway) - you might 
want to check the disassembly. 
However, this patch is just for testing, to verify that your problem 
really is that particular race. It's not a proper fix.
I suspect that pty's should always lock each others line disciplines too, 
not just their "own" side.
