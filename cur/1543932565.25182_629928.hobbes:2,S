This is not normal.  When you plug in a storage device you should get 
all of the messages in your part 1 plus the first two lines in your 
part 2, but not the rest of part 2.

You must have a typo there.  Those can't both be true for 2.6.24-rc5.  
In fact you shouldn't see part 2 at all.
Here's what I get when I plug in a USB mass-storage device under 
2.6.24-rc5:
[   87.903014] usb-storage: device found at 2
[   87.909570] scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access              Memorex TD 2B    1.09 PQ: 0 ANSI: 0 CCS

Mounting the disk produces no extra output at all.  I get the same 
result under 2.6.23 and earlier operating systems.  You should see 
approximately the same thing.
