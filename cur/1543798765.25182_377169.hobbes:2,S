There is no need to disable interrupts AFAICS, but only preemption
(which could cause problems as your comment above describes). I suppose
that these counters are not accessed at interrupt time and are not meant
to be, right?
Which means that if an interrupt happens at any point in the code,
the state will be consistent after the IRQ(s) handler(s) finish and
execution restarts where it had been interrupted.
Why not use preempt_disable/preempt_enable? Those would disappear
if !CONFIG_PREEMPT, and could be faster than the interrupt
disabling/enabling (no need to save "flags" on stack, but increment
preempt count, which has a chance to be on cache, I guess).
It would also be nice to have all code related to debugging only
counters selectable at compile time, since it might not be interesting
data for some scenarios (but unnecessary bloat) - seems that was the
original intent by Andrew as you noted.
