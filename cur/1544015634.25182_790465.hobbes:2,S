It depends on the implementation of the filesystem you are running
on.
On XFS, it won't break anything because it uses a two-phase unlink.
The unlink() syscall removes the inode from the namespace
transactionally which means that even if you crash after the
directory fsync then they will never, ever appear in the directory
after recovery. In fact, recovery will see all those inodes as
existing on the unlinked lists and hence the execute the second
phase of the unlink during recovery.
I have no idea what the behaviour of other filesystems will
be but it needs to be evaluated on a filesystem-by-filesystem
basis.
Hmmmm. That introduces another interesting question w.r.t async
unlink in XFS - it's going to hammer the on-disk unlinked list hash
tables in XFS. The hashes are only 64 chains wide (per AG) so
pumping thousands of inodes into them is going to increase the
minimum memory footprint of XFS during rm -rf operations
substantially.
Cheers,
Dave.
