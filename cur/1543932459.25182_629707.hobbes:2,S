Hugh, I want to understand how patches 3/4 and 4/4 are related.  In patch 3
you say "in order to fix truncation" but you mention a truncation problem
only in patch 4; is there a patch ordering problem, or they're both related
to the same issue (with 3/4 being a code cleanup, and 4/4 actually fixing
the problem)?
What tests did you conduct to tickle this truncation problem: I assume
fsx-linux through unionfs, mounted on tmpfs?  Did that include both series
of patches (your 9 tmpfs patches, plus the two memcgrpoup?).
Thanks,
Erez.
