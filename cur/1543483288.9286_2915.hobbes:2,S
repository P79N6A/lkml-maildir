Ya mean:  options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5 mpu_io=x330 ->
NOT?
Sob, <lazy> sob! mpu_io=0x300?  arrrggghh! means my pnp ne NIC
has to be changed to support another workable I/O! Hmmmm...
just curious what brought the change from 2.0.* -> 2.1.* ->
2.2.*
for the mpu_io= change??? And also curious if NOT selecting pnp
since the NIC is a disabled pnp NIC...never mind, shouldn't
matter :-P
Hmmmm, me readum more Manuals & docs! ;-)

I'm gonna try to change the mpu_io= to 0x{not conflict with NIC}
