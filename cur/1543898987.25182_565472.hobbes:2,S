One of many useful things for system without blinking lights, disk 
network, thermal alert, etc. And a cheap helper for handicapped folks 
who can't hear an audible alert.

Endlessly useful, alarm clock, non-fatal errors on boot, etc.
<it would be nice>
If this were done, priority levels would be nice, so the "I'm taking a 
dump" or "panic" would block lower level system use like disk or network 
lights, and user applications would have some policy to put them higher 
or lower than the pseudo disk light (or not).
