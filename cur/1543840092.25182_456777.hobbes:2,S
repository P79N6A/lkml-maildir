> One if my users cannot access directories that belong to a group he actually _is_ a member of. That, however, is true only when accessing them over NFS. On the local file system, everything is fine. UIDs and GIDs are the same on client and server, so that cannot be the problem. Client and server run Gentoo Linux with kernel 2.6.16 on the server and 2.6.17 on the client.
NFSv2 has a 8 groups limit in the protocol iirc.
