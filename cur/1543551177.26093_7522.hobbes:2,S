Hi Linus,
I'm maintaining a more recent driver for 3dfx cards than that one in the 
kernel  now. 
A made my latest release as a patch for 2.4.0-test9. It can be downloaded 
from 
http://www.medex.hu/~danthe/tdfx.
 I won't attach it, because it's too 
long.  
Main changes: 
- voodoo5 support
- MIPS support
- multihead support
- support other than 8 bit width fonts
- 2.4 style device initialization (pci_driver API)
- many bugfixes and testing
Please apply.
Bye,
			Attila Kesmarki
