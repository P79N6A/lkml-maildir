Given a kernel panic with a partial traceback (actually it's a jpg
taken with a digital camera of a screen), how would I identify the
line where the panic occured.
Basically I want something that tells me the offsets of a given line
of code.  I've used tools to do this on other operating systems, what
should I use on Linux?
