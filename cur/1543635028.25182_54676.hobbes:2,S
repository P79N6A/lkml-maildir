For pagecache pages we're OK - they're only added to pagecache
once, and PG_arch_1 is cleared at page allocation time.
However swapcache pages are added and removed.
It's rather moot, because swapcache pages are not subject to
flush_dcache_page() any more.  If you're using swap-over-NBD
then I guess networking makes its own arrangements...
So hmmm.  Actually, I think the current behaviour is correct.
If a page is added to swapcache then removed then added, then
removed, the kernel should never stomp on PG_arch_1.  That's
an arch-private cache to say "you need to perform cache writeback
for this page if another mm later shares it", yes?  So we need
to preserve that info as the page enters and leaves swapcache.
I think.
