Good spotting!
Here is a patch.  I've tested it on my system and it works for me.
I changed $(CC) in the top-level Makefile and verified that this line
calls the $(CC) that I specify.
Could you please try it and let me know if it works for you?  If it does
work, I'll send it to Alan Cox for 2.2.15.
