Because there are the exceptions that get it correct based on the level of
ATA support reported in the IDENTIFY page.
When I state that it is all screwed up, I mean in a contigious nature of
the Standard.  The rules for ATA-4 with ATA-4 limited support is correct
as is ATA-5 with ATA-5, and ATA-6 with ATA-6, but ATA-4 rules do not mix
with ATA-5 nor ATA-6.  This is the mess in front of me to sort.
So we default a full test of both bits 13 and 14, but it you have a
hardware combination that fails the rules.
ATA-4 is HOST side and Device side based on Bit 13 only
ATA-5 is HOST side and Device side based on Bit 14 only
ATA-6 is HOST side and Device side based on Bit 14 and Bit 13
ATA-6 is the correct method...
