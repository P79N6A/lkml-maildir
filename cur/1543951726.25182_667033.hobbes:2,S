Ok, stupid me, this was my fault.  I was assuming that pci busses would
never be registered multiple times with the pci core.  Obviously this
isn't true.  The previous patch I proposed was only paying attention to
the PCI devices, and that logic is just fine (it's already protected
when it is attempted to be registered multiple times.)
So, the patch below fixes the issue for me, and reboot seems to work as
well.
Guennadi, can you test this out on your machine?
thanks for your patience,

Subject: PCI: fix issue with busses registering multiple times in sysfs
PCI busses can be registered multiple times, so we need to detect if we
have registered our bus structure in sysfs already.  If so, don't do it
again.
Thanks to Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski@gmx.de> for reporting
the problem, and to Linus for poking me to get me to believe that it was
a real problem.
