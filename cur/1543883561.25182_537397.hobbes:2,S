Why isn't it done yet? If the bugs were already forwarded to 
linux-kernel (and perhaps, to linux-<subsystem> when possible, too), we 
would save at least two days of this long "Linux 2.6.21" thread...
For I somehow feel that most people here dislike bugzilla because of 
misconceptions - which only arose as bugzilla.kernel.org is *really* 
misconfigured.
