Change config
make SUBLEVEL=0-config1 bzImage modules modules_install
Change config
make SUBLEVEL=0-config2 bzImage modules modules_install
creates /lib/modules/x.y.0-config1 and /lib/modules/x.y.0-config2.  You
*must* do this to keep modules separate if you want multiple configs
for the same kernel on one machine.  If you do not change one of
VERSION, PATCHLEVEL or SUBLEVEL then you have two kernels with the same
value of uname -r which really stuffs up modules.

Edit top level Makefile, uncomment INSTALL_PATH.
Change config.
make INSTALL_PATH=/var/tmp/machine1 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/var/tmp/machine1 \
	bzImage modules install modules_install
Change config.
make INSTALL_PATH=/var/tmp/machine2 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/var/tmp/machine2 \
	bzImage modules install modules_install
Copy /var/tmp/machine{1,2} to target systems.  Have a cup of coffee.
The Makefile system is tuned for the common case, one config on a
single machine.  But it can handle harder cases.  I admit that the
current method of handling multiple configs or machines leaves a bit to
be desired.  The ability to cleanly handle multiple configs, multiple
target systems and do it all from a single source tree is on our
wishlist for the 2.5 Makefile rewrite.
