It doesn't matter very much but I think this would look
better after the first if check.

I have known issues with RCU, but dare to disagree here.
It's done during call_rcu, so anything RCU friendly shouldn't
see this at the moment at all. It could be needed for those
with refcounting - than it should be checked, if there is
anything more than port_carrier_check.
I don't have enough time to check this deep enough, but at
the moment I think this patch is right (there is really a
very short race time between calling this function and
container_of).
