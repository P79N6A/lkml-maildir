As (1) SPF this is demonstrably useless to establish trust and (2) the
argument that SPF doesn't provide the required blacklist information
hasn't been countered yet, it follows that
SPF just makes life harder for everyone without real benefits in return.
SPF also prefers end-to-end mailings and falls short when relays are
used - but these are advocated by the SPF disciples.
Can this SPF madness please be buried now?
