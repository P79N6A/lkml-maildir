Hi Shane, this is more of a www.kernelnewbies.org question, but I have
some free time on my hands, so I'll reply to some of your questions.

Good book, you might also want to read:

Basically it goes back to where it was interrupted. Now there's some other
things that are affected by this.
If the timer interrupt went off it may run update_process_times and may
decide that the process ran enough. Or another interrupt went off and woke
up a higher priority process.  When the current running process needs to
be preempted, it has it's need_resched flag set (set_need_resched), so
when leaving the interrupt if:
1) going back to userland
2) going back to the kernel and CONFIG_PREEMPT is set and preempt_count is
   zero
Then schedule is called and it will most likely schedule another process.
If CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set, then the schedule waits till the kernel
calls schedule directly or goes back to userspace.
If CONFIG_PREEMPT is set but the preempt_count was active, then when
preempt_count gets down to zero, a check of need_resched is made, and if
set it calls schedule.

Signals are added to the task and are handled when going back to userland.

That's called nested interrupts, and that will never schedule until the
last interrupt returns.
Then we have the issue of softirqs and tasklets :) but that's another
story.
