Ok. But the approach is just not so good. If you _really_ need something
like that and it is a win over the regular non-atomic unlock, then you
just have to implement it as a generic locking / atomic operation and
allow all architectures to implement the optimal (and correct) memory
barriers.
Anyway....

I'm sure it could have an effect. But why is the common case in SLUB
for the cacheline to be bouncing? What's the benchmark? What does SLAB
do in that benchmark, is it faster than SLUB there? What does the
non-atomic bit unlock do to Willy's database workload?
