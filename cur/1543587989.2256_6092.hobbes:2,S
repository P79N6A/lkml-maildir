It should work, note that I recently spotted some quite severe bugs in
the pio write handling for ATAPI which I've almost fixed here now. It
seems you drive is in DMA mode though, so it shouldn't be affecting you.
Please send me strace info when reading/writing to the drive (or at
least attempting to), this looks very queer indeed.
