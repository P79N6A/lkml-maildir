I forgot to mention, this is with the ARM architecture, so the mtrr
stuff won't help me much.  I'm porting some code from vxWorks to Linux
that used the vxWorks call dmaCacheMalloc() to allocate memory that was
marked uncacheable, and I was just curious if Linux had something
similar in a generic sense.
