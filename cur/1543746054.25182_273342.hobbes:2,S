These are the command-lines of my test suite:
  jackd -R -dalsa -dhw:0 -P20 -r44100 -p64 -n2 -S -P &
  fluidsynth -s -i -a jack -j -o jack.audio.id=fluid1 -o shell.port=9800
ct4mgm.sf2 &
  fluidsynth -s -i -a jack -j -o jack.audio.id=fluid2 -o shell.port=9801
ct4mgm.sf2 &
  .
  .
  .
  fluidsynth -s -i -a jack -j -o jack.audio.id=fluid8 -o shell.port=9807
ct4mgm.sf2 &
Versions are:
  jack 0.99.10cvs
  fluidsynth 1.0.5

Not sure, but the first time I've noticed it was on RT-0.7.29-2 and that
was purely by chance. Problem is that I've been building the RT kernels
under a non-RT stock kernel, so I can't say how long or when it all
started exactly. I remember however that this is a revisited issue,
thought.
Cheers.
