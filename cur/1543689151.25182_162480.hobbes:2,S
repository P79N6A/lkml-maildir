Hi,
I've tested the patch you submitted for ide-io.c (I've tested it in 
test4-mm5).
It solves the ide-cd problem, and the suspend process get to next step. 
It frees memory. However, just after that, the system get in a loop 
displaying "Bad: scheduling while atomic". I'm not able to capture the 
output of this, the laptop only responding to syrq.
Hope it helps you.
