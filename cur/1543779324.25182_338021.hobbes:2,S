Ok, here's the list:
Adaptec AHA-1510A
(ISA, centronix-style external connector with terminator, one internal
ribbon cable,
I probably have some centronix-style external cables around too, this
card doesn't have it's own boot ROM)
Gravis UltraSound a.k.a. GUS
(ISA, fully loaded with memory, 1megabyte (I think))
Pertec MyTape 800
(I think this is a QIC tape drive that connects via the floppy interface)
TEAC 1.44  3.5 inch Floppy FDR
(FD-235HF)
Rocket Port 8-port serial board
(ISA, 8 - RJ11 jacks, made by Comtrol, brand-new in-box)
