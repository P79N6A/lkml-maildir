Well, you can do it by storing the pointer privately and hijacking it.  
However, I think we'd use the existing kernel notifier chain stuff for that if 
it is valuable.

I'm happy with keeping probe and remove in the bus specific driver template 
and having the <bustype>_add_driver install generic device probe and remove 
routines to handle these cases.  My point was that the docs implied I should 
use the generic driver probe and remove routines, which I can't without some 
type of functionality like this.
If you envisage us never eliminating the driver specific probe and remove 
routines, I'm happy.  I'm less happy if there will come a day when I have to 
revisit all the converted drivers to do the elimination.
