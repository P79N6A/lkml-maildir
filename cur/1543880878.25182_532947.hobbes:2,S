The latest version of the per device dirty throttling.
against 2.6.21-rc6-mm1; the first patch is for easy application.
Andrew can of course just drop the patch it reverts.
Merged BDI_DIRTY and BDI_UNSTABLE into BDI_RECLAIMABLE, and multiplied
bdi_stat_delta() by the number of counters summed.
Thanks to Miklos for pointing these out.
