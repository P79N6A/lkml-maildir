It's desirable that the patch descriptions tell us _how_ a bug was fixed,
as well as what the bug was.  It means that people don't have to ask
questions like:
>  void __kprobes lock_kprobes(void)
>  {
> +	unsigned long flags = 0;

what is this change trying to do?  If a lock is taken from both process and
irq contexts then local IRQs must be disabled for the entire period when the
lock is held, not just for a little blip like this.  If IRQ-context code is
running this function then the code is deadlockable.
Now, probably there's deep magic happening here and I'm wrong.  If so then
please explain the code's magic via a comment patch so the question doesn't
arise again, thanks.
