I think his changes ensure this as well, at least for local system
sockets.  You'll only get a new hop each time a route lookup is
performed, which is only done once per socket unless the path
becomes "sick" and TCP decides to try and do a relookup of the
destination.
I'm kind of ambivalent about these changes.  I definitely like the
first patch which cleans up those huge functions in route.c :-)
But there are things I like about the current behavior, although I
understand why people want things to work the way Einar is changing
it to.
