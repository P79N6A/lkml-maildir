I don't think it is a bug in general. It really depends on the allocation:
- If it is a path that might be required in order to writeout a page, then
yes GFP_NOFS is going to help prevent deadlocks.
- If it is a path where you'll take the same locks as page reclaim requires,
then again GFP_NOFS is required.
For NTFS case, it seems like holding i_mutex on the write path falls foul
of the second problem. But I agree with Andrew that this is a critical case
where we do have to enter the fs. GFP_NOFS is too big a hammer to use.
I guess you'd have to change NTFS to do something sane privately, or come
up with a nice general solution that doesn't harm the common filesystems
that apparently don't have a problem here... can you just add GFP_NOFS to
NTFS's mapping_gfp_mask to start with?
