I'm fine with changing the delivery mode to dest_LowestPrio.  However, 
someone changed the default destination mask that target_cpus() returns 
from XAPIC_DEST_CPUS_MASK (0F) to APIC_ALL_CPUS (FF).  The latter value 
is a bad idea.  I'm unaware of anyone's hardware that will correctly 
arbitrate dest_LowestPrio among all CPUs of all clusters.  (Please 
correct me if I'm wrong.)  By chance, FF mostly works on IBM Summit 
(EXA) chips, but we can't rely on that in the future.
And if the delivery mode is dest_Fixed, then FF means "broadcast to all 
CPUs", which is plainly wrong too.
It would be safer to change back to some value whose behavior is well 
defined in Intel's docs, like XAPIC_DEST_CPUS_MASK or John's 
suggestion, cpumask_of_cpu(0).  Either one will cause almost all 
interrupts to land on CPU 0 for P4s.  IRQ balancing will shift them to 
other processors soon enough.
I note that in 2.6.8.1 the other clustered sub-arches do something 
similar to John's or my suggestion.  Only numaq uses APIC_ALL_CPUS, and 
it has special APIC cluster controllers.  (Even there, 0F is arguably 
clearer than FF, but the custom chips never route dest_LowestPrio 
interrupts outside of the local cluster, so the upper nibble doesn't 
matter.)
Alternative patch for include/asm-i386/mach-summit/mach_apic.h:
 static inline cpumask_t target_cpus(void)
 {
-	return CPU_MASK_ALL;
+	/* Start on cluster 0.  IRQ balancing will spread load soon. */
+	return XAPIC_DEST_CPUS_MASK;	
 } 
 #define TARGET_CPUS    (target_cpus())
