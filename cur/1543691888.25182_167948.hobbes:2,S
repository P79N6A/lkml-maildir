Not quite right.
	a) on "0xZ" correct reaction is to eat '0' and stop.
	b) while we are at it, might as well fix the case of 0X<...> with
base 0.
The following, AFAICS, would be correct:
        if (*cp == '0') {
                cp++;
                if (unlikely((*cp == 'x' || *cp == 'X') && isxdigit(cp[1]))) {
                        if (!base || base == 16) {
                                cp++;
                                base = 16;
                        }
                } else if (!base)
                        base = 8;
        } else if (!base)
                base = 10;
