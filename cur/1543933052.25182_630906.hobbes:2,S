Hello,
We are trying to test with kernel version 2.6.20,the RFC 3390
implementation of increased initial congestion window size(~4 when
MSS=1460 bytes).We are not getting consistent results
meaning,sometimes we see 4 data pkts sent without an ACK received and
sometimes we see 3.Also we would like to test by setting the initial
cwnd to a value more than 4.Can you guys advise us on how to do
that(where in the code should we change and what)?Also mention if
using linux 2.6.23 kernel instead of  the one we are using,would help
in this work.
Thanks and Regards
Sourav
