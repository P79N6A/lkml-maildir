    Changing the WRITE to READ does solve the problem, thank you.
    
    I am still confused about why the code failed the way it did.  The module
    managed to write to the full 1,000,000, and the user programme could read it
    and verify it was correct.  Just nothing else worked after that!
    
    Am I the only one who finds the READ/WRITE option back to front?
    
No, I was just thinking it should be change to USER_READ, USER_WRITE
or something a little more obvious. 
Stephen?
