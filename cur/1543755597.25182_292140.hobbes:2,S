yes and no. You are right in that the individual workloads (e.g.
softirqs) are not separated and identified/credited to the thread that
requested them. (in part due to the fact that you cannot e.g. credit a
thread for e.g. unrequested workloads like incoming sockets, or for
'merged' workloads like writeout of a commonly accessed file.)
but Jack is right in practical terms: the audio folks achieved pretty
good results with the current IRQ threading mechanism, partly due to the
fact that the audio stack doesnt use softirqs, so all the
latency-critical activities are in the audio IRQ thread and the
application itself.
