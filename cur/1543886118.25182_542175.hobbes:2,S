Traditionally, we have always been very conservative about enabling more
than the absolute minimum in partition format support. Some formats can be
erroneously identified by the check code if you don't get the ordering
right (the case I know about, MSDOS partitions vs. Atari TOS/GEM
partitions, hinges on a particular checksum being calculated in the atari
code). I've moved the msdos checker to the bottom of the list more often
than I can keep track of...
If sysv68 cannot be confused with any other format, no harm done by
enabling it by default. Otherwise, things may get interesting.
