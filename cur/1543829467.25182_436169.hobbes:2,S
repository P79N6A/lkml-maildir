maybe these figures can help to make our choice:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2226384  223824  110624 2560832  271340 vmlinux-arch-pfn-offset-0
2228488  223824  110624 2562936  271b78 vmlinux-arch-pfn-offset-not-0
2226964  223856  110624 2561444  2715a4 vmlinux-out-of-line-pfn-to-page
Arch is MIPS and I used gcc 3.4.4
So your solution gives the smallest kernel with my config although the win
is only 0.1%. Maybe it would be good to have ARM figures/opinion too.
