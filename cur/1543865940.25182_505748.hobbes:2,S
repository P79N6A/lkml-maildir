 Well, if the function called at offset 0 in the real-mode section return
 non zero, that is probably an error - that is Gujin interface, but do not ask
 me to change other bootloaders to handle that.
 This function is called with few parameters, one is a string pointer
 if the function do not want to print the problem report itself.
 The function is called with an offset of zero in its own intel segment.

  Well, for my defense, if Gujin do not find the real mode code in the program
 header it search for it in the section table, if the program header cannot be
 modified for some reason. There may be some issues if that ELF file is
 "stripped" but it seems to work on my side.

  There was still a test not that long ago (in the code I am not executing) - but
 I was wrong to bring this point forward.

  Well, you can generate with the proposed patch and boot with SYSLINUX,
 Grub and LILO, but trying to clean Linux real-mode code is where I begun.

  I like to think mine is more stable - maybe I am a dreamer...
  I do not compete on network booting neither.
