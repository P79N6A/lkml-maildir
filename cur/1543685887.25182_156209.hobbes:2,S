Out of curiosity I decided to try this on some other Athlon
systems I have.  I tried it on a dual Athlon MP 2400(2GHz)
system with a Tyan 2462 motherboard.  Also I tried it on a
single Athlon XP 1800 with a Asus A7V motherboard.  They
both booted fine with the 2.6.0-test2 kernel and the machine
exception code in it.  So I am thinking either it is something
with the older CPU's or the CPU is actually borked.  Like I said
though I have been using those 1.2GHz processors for a long time
with no problems.
