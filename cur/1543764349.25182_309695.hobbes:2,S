Yes, that's something I tried to say
when talking about the interrupt gates
(sorry if I wasn't clear).

Yes, and that's where I think my patch is
at fault, i.e. it just shouldn't do this.
Another option is to make it always possible
to access OLDSS(%esp), but I think it is just
my patch have to be fixed to not do this at all.

No, that wasn't my point at all. That example
with moving "sti" was *only* to answer Linus's
question of where we have an empty stack.
And I guess I wasn't clear enough also here,
I was in a hurry :(
The real patch I meant, is this one:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0504.0/1287.html
This, I am sure, fixes a real bug. But there
can be the other approaches too.

But as an example for demonstrating the problem,
I thought, it could do:)

That's probably too heavy-handed. The fix is
really simple, we can either store the right
values by hands (as you propose), or fix my
patch (as I propose).

But what will this solve? If I understand you
correctly, you will push the %ss/%esp of the
user-space process that did sysenter. Then
you enable the interrupts and get pre-empted.
Now what we have: OLDSS/OLDESP are of the
user-space process, but the EFLAGS/CS/EIP
are of the kernel (where it got pre-empted
on a sysenter path). This will avoid the crash,
but the information on stack is still wrong.
Or am I missing something?

Hmm, will it work also for NMIs? You move
the sti, you can't be pre-empted, but the
NMI uses the restore_all too, no?
Also, it seems that Linus wants only the
*some* values available on stack, just to
make it not to crash. I think we can simply
adjust the tss.esp0 to point 8 bytes below
the real stack top, and so we are always safe.
