I'm talking about an OS in protected mode... in any case how can I access to 
this memory region if it's mapped for other things?
I've done some tests with a simple kernel which I wrote: all that region 
(except video memory at 0xb8000) results "read only"...
So I THINK YOU mean: "you can use more than 640KB in real mode using a memory 
manager that "remap" 0xC0000 (for example) to 0x100000 or something like it"
Right?
