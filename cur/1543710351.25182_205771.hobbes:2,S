the issue is one of "current generation" radio units, as used in 
802.11a/b/g are typically very programmable, and in many cases, can both 
send & receive on frequencies well outside of the standard 802.11a/b/g 
2.4GHz and 5.4GHz bands.
i'd hazard a guess and say that this is the primary reason for the concern 
in releasing true "open source" for the firmware.
potentially, the equipment could be used outside of the range of 
frequencies that it is intended for (and indeed FCC certified for).
i know of at least one radio that can snoop other frequencies such as 
police/emergency services/ ...
cheers,
