I don't think it _is_ relevant.  Wev'e scanned the crap out of all the
eligible zones, found nothing swappable outable or otherwise reclaimable. 
That's as good a definition of oom as you're likely to get.  It takes care
of mlocked user memory too.

The overcommit logic doesn't need to care about pinned kernel allocations. 
All it cares about is reclaimable and free pages.  Its calculation of what
is reclaimable is a bit wonky because of ramfs/sysfs/ramdisk pages and
metadata, and because of mlock.
But for this problem, I do suspect that going oom if all the eligible zones
are pegged out should suffice.  It is certainly accurate.
It could be that the ->all_unreclaimable logic has rotted over the ages and
may ned some attention - I haven't explicitly checked it in a year or more.
Also there's some problem at present wherein the oomkiller takes 30 or
more seconds to kick in and do its thing, which I need to look at.  This
happens when there's no swap online.  It might also happen when swapspace
is full - I didn't check.
