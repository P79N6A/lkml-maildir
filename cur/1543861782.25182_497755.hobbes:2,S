  But isn't it then potential DOS? If you happen to union two filesystems
and an untrusted user has write access to both original filesystem and
the union, then you say he'd be able to produce oops? That does not
sound very secure to me... And if any secure use of unionfs requires
limitting access to the original trees, then I think it's a good reason
to implement it in unionfs itself. Just my 2 cents.
