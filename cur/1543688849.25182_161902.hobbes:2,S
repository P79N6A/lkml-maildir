Right.  It's a circular buffer for signal processing: DSP code sees
contiguous ascending addresses.  The multiple maps mean we don't have
to copy the contents of the buffer back to the start periodically, nor
mask the offset into the array on each memory access, nor write
extra-complicated DSP code which can handle split regions.
It's an optimisation, it works well on some architectures and on
others it's not worth it.  On those, I just copy - it keeps the DSP
code fast and simple.

To fool the coherence test, interrupts would need to arrive in a 2
instruction window, at least 8192 times.  It is possible, but unlikely
except in pathological situations.
Of course if you make mmap() return EINVAL then it cannot possible fail :)

How?  SHMLBA is a run time value on the Sparc; I have no idea how
to work it out.
