That would be a bug in touch_nmi_watchdog then, because you're
racy against your own NMI too.
So I'm actually not very very wrong at all. I'm technically wrong
because touch_nmi_watchdog has a theoretical 'bug'. In practice,
multiple races with the non atomic increments to the same counter,
and in an unbroken sequence would be about as likely as hardware
failure.
Anyway, this touch nmi thing is going off topic, sorry list.

Well the loops that are in there now aren't covered up, and they
don't seem to be causing problems. Ergo there is no problem (we're
being _practical_ here, right?)

That's very nice. But there is no problem _now_, is there?

Well luckily we're not going to be aggravating the rwlock stavation.
If you found a problem with, and fixed do_task_stat: ?time, ???_flt,
et al, then you would apply the same solution to per thread rss to
fix it in the same way.
