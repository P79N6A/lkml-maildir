Chris,
   I have a scsi cdrw and had the same trouble until....
(btw: I use the command line)
nice -18 cdrecord -speed=4 -dev=4,0 image.iso
makes sure cdrecord gets the attention it deserves.  I have never
gotten a time out since.  The idea is that you don't want a coaster, I
have enough already.  If your cdrw is fast enough, you won't mind the
wait.
