There should be a jumper on the back of your new ATAPI drive.
Remove the jumper and the problems should be gone.
OR:
access the device as "/dev/hdb" instead of "/dev/hdb1".
What's happening:
- The device is jumpered as "ATAPI FLOPPY".
- Windows 95 & Windows NT do not expect a partition sector
on such devices.
- Iomega has implemented a hardware solution:
skip the first 32 sectors if the device is jumpered as
ATAPI FLOPPY.
- The Iomega formatter creates always a 32 sector partitions
table.
You can also disable the `FLOPPY' mode by software
(new Iomega ATAPI commands were added), but AFAIK
Linux doesn't support them.
