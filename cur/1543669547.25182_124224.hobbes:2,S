    But the disks are probed in the same manner as last time
    (if the disks/controllers are not moved, crashed etc..).
    So we will end up getting same names.
Oh, but if next_index is 0 in the module (or reset by the
init_module code), then also with index = next_index++
things will be the same after rmmod/insmod.
