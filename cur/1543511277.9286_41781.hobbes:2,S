Hi fellow kernel dissectors,
I have a small coding dilemma, and I was wondering if you could help me
see why something is not happening the I way I want it to.
I invoke a system call from a child user-space process (meaning that this
process itself has been fork()'d), and that system call uses a call to
kernel_thread() in arch/.../process.c to set up another (kernel-space)
process.  What I want to happen is I want this kernel-space process to die
completely (without sticking around as a zombie) as soon as the procedure
whose pointer was passed to kernel-thread exits; but I don't want to do
anything similar to waitpid in the user process.  How can I go about doing
that?
I have tried adding signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN) in the user process before it
invokes the system call as suggested by the Unix FAQ, but that doesn't
seem to work.  Perhaps there are some flags to kernel_thread that will
make the process die and clean up after itself?~
Please help me out.  I am doing research on building high-performance
features into the kernel but because of this problem I run out of
processes much faster than I should.
Thanks in advance.
