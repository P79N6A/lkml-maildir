I will send patches for the following stuff, on top
of your current -mm, which has my previous patches applied.

No problem.

Yeah, it was like this in the old RNG driver. I would also like to
drop it, as I don't see a real advantage from it. But I don't
like to drop the hwrng_data_present() polling bit of it, because...

Some HW RNG might require some time between data_reads to gather
new entropy. The short polling here makes sure we don't return too
early from the syscall. So it reduces syscall overhead. Imagine a
device which needs 20usecs between reads to gather new entropy.
The first read will succeed and probably only return one byte of
entropy. The next attempt to data_present in the while loop will
fail and the syscall will return with one byte read. userspace will
need to call the syscall for every byte (in this case).
We could, of course, add a variable to struct hwrng that indicates the
average needed time a device needs to gather new entropy in most cases.
So we could poll for this time instead of the rather random 200usecs.

Will drop this.

Sure. Leftover from the old driver.

Yes, sir.
