I can't reproduce that behaviour on another SMP machine with the same
kernel-config for 2.6.18.1 (only storage and network device drivers
differ).
The affected one is a production machine I can't use to test, and
furthermore the only one I've got of that series.
Has to wait until the weekend. Any remote clue so I know where to look?
Thanks,
M
