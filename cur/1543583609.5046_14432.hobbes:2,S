I'm really curious about this one myself.
Since I haven't digested all of the tulip media stuff in my brain yet,
and since I'm not familiar with all the corner cases, I'm loathe to
change the tulip media stuff without fully understanding what's going
on.
If you have a single controller with multiple MII phys...  how does one
select the phy of choice (for tulip, in the absence of SROM media
table...)?  And once phy A has been selected out of N available as the
active phy, should you care about the others at all?
