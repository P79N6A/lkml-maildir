Hi.
I am getting problems with floppy drive in 2.4.17.
All started with floppy not working in 18-rc4, went back to 17
and still does not work. Just plain 2.4.17, no patching.
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/fd0 just hangs forever.
mkfs -v -t ext2 /dev/fd0 gives:
mke2fs 1.26 (3-Feb-2002)
mkfs.ext2: bad blocks count - /dev/fd0
Hardware:
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
ide-floppy driver 0.97.sv
???
TIA
