yes - the patch does not put any limit on which areas can be PROT_EXEC -
if the executable area is 'too wide' then there's no protection. The patch
tries to relocate areas which are freely relocatable, to make sure that in
the usual case the exec-limit will be quite low.

yeah, we should not be worried about old loaders.

i'll remove X_workaround from the next patch altogether - X can be fixed
by enabling an executable stack for the binary.
