This is the right solution imho, yes. Adding more indirection with
pci-domain isn't useful.
Now, we should also fix pci_setup_device to make this naming
generic to the entire kernel don't you think ? This won't
affect /proc/bus/pci as it doesn't use the slot_name field
in pci_dev, but at least it will make naming consistent.
(That also mean increasing slot_name size in pci.h)
