Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/7] Freezer: Hardening and preparation for CPU hotplug changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The following series of patches implements the changes to the task freezer
that should close the remaining races in it and harden it before it's used for
the CPU hotplugging.
Not all of the patches are from me, but I've decided to make the series out
of all freezer-related patches that have been posted recently.  If I have
missed some of them, please let me know.
Most of the patches in this series have been already discussed, so they
should be fine, but of course additional comments are welcome.
Greetings,
Rafael
