The generated code is different for both cases but for some reason gcc has 
trouble with __builtin_return_address on x86-64.
For e.g. specifying gcc -fo-f-p, a method produces following assembly.
method_1:
.LFB2:
        subq    $8, %rsp
.LCFI0:
        movl    $__FUNCTION__.0, %esi
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        movl    $0, %eax
        call    printf
        movl    $0, %eax
        addq    $8, %rsp
        ret
And with -fno-o-f-p,  the same method yields 
method_1:
.LFB2:
        pushq   %rbp
.LCFI0:
        movq    %rsp, %rbp
.LCFI1:
        movl    $__FUNCTION__.0, %esi
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        movl    $0, %eax
        call    printf
        movl    $0, %eax
        leave
        ret
