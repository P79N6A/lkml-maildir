ACK, but rmdir will leave the applications in a directory with no way in 
or out. This directory can as well be on the moon, so there is no need to 
keep the fs busy.

If the file is open, the modified version will wait for the file to be
closed. If the nfs daemon has closed the file handle, you can unmount with
or without the modification, and with always the same data loss.

*This* will give you guaranteed data loss on more than the mounted fs.
Murphy will make some long-running jobs depend on the screen session that 
was originally started from the mounted dir. Off cause screen doesn't 
chdir to "/" after starting the shell.
