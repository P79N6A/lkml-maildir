i dont understand how is that better than notification on tlb flush?
i mean cpus have very smiler problem as we do,
so why not deal with the notification at the same place as they do (tlb 
flush) ?
moreover notification on tlb flush allow unmodified applications to work 
with us
for example the memory merging driver that i wrote was able to work with kvm
without any change to its source code.
