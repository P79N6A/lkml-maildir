Not always. The keys can be changed during the session at random times to
increase security.

But the double encryption further increases security by making intercepting
the encrypted data read from the filesystem even harder.

True, if root will look directly on your application's memory, then we can't
do anything about it, but if the terminal the client uses works in a
(hypothetical) encrypted mode the it would take a truly determined root to
read the transmission even locally. But, true, local connections in that
case would make the transmission encryption practically useless.

No, I suggest that root can snoop on the user's connection and intercept the
encryption keys used in the transmission - then he can decrypt everything
on the fly.
