Could you expand on how you see that being implemented, please?  It
doesn't feel entirely comfortable to me - providing a bus for the chip
seems more direct and the platform bus not what I'd think of using for
something hanging off another bus - but I think I'm just not visualising
what you're thinking of properly.

The multi-function device support does feel like it could be a good fit.
I'd seen it discussed sometime last year but don't recall seeing
anything for quite a while.  Like Ben said, any pointers to current work
would be appreciated.
It's probably worth mentioning that in addition to what is in the
current patch series these chips all also provide an audio codec which
requires a reasonably substantial driver for full support.
