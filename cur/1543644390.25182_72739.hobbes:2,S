Ugh??  Something is _seriously_ messed up here.
The CPU utilization is only 8% but the time is nearly 10x worse.  You
sure the only difference was the compiler?  I could think gcc-3.2 makes
some poorer choices wrt code optimization, but nothing feasible can come
to mind that would produce such terrible results.
Also, I believe RedHat is compiling their kernel in 8.0 with gcc-3.2,
unless they reintroduced kgcc.  Surely that are not seeing these abysmal
numbers.
