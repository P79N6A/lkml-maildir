Subject: [PATCH] Fix multiple blockdev-based filesystem mounts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/7/64

The attached patch fixes multiple mounts of the same blockdev-based filesystem
(such as EXT3). The problem is that the path through the function that deals
with a second mount of an already extant superblock is going out through the
error path and not the success path that sets up the vfsmount.
The error can be checked by doing something like:
	mount /dev/hda6 /a
	mount /dev/hda6 /b
Where /dev/hda6 has something like an EXT3 filesystem on it. The second mount
should succeed, but doesn't without this patch.
This patch is dependent on the getsb patch submitted earlier.
