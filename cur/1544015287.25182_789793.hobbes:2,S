The problem we have is that the sg list the drivers were given had a
segment which was not divisible in length by four and was *NOT* the last
segment in the sg list
The logic in the ATA PIO code is basically
	for each sg entry
		compute the number of bytes to transfer staying within
the page
		transfer that many bytes (but may be more)
		if and only if the transfer is NOT the last segment but is
			more than the bytes requested - WARN
The block alignment is set to 4 bytes so the block code should be handing
down stuff which is safe. Some of the sense and other stuff is "adjusted"
by the libata-scsi conversion code which at this point I suspect is the
offender.
This is why libata uses the pad buffers we don't get to be quite so exact
about transfer sizes as SCSI is.
