The kernel uses c only (plus a little asm, if there is just no other
possibility). If it is trivial for me to convert your c++ to c, I will
do that. But since I don't really speak c++, c would be nicer.

Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized
things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data
structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
