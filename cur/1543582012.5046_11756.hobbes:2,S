Sorry, I was quite incoherent.  Many others have pointed out that there exist
patches for non-executatble stack, and the problems with it. That's what I meant to
comment on.  But I'm glad to find out about bounds checking as an option.

That's why I was wondering of limiting privileged addresses security at a more
fundamental level... as you say above,
this fixes *ONE* source of bugs(security threats)... but itn't it inevitable that
there will be others?  But if services are each put
in a separate box, that doesn't have a door leading to the inner sanctum, things would
be more secure in spite of "bugs".
Well I thank everyone for their responses in this thread, I think It's been beaten
into the ground (my original idea),
and I'm left with some food for thought.
