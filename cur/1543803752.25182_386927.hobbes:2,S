Hello,

thanks for this hint. Now I see a difference between
memmap=128K$7936K mem=130944K
and
mem=130944K memmap=128K$7936K
With mem first, the memmap region is listed as user defined. With memmap
first, it isn't.
But I have to do more tests. In both cases my system crash on heavy load.
After trying the badram patch I'm not sure, that my address ranges are
correct...
Thanks, Reinhold
