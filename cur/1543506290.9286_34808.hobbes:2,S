Solutions that I've seen, though well thought out, all
have their flaws. Here are a few scenarios:
1. Filtering Mechanisms
	Many of these are complex. Most can be circumvented.
2. Moderators (semi-open)
	This could harm the reputation of the linux community
	as one where "some guy in Nebraska submits a bug. Someone
	else in Sweeden fixes it the next day".
	Another problem with the moderator model is the sheer number
	of posts. In order to stay ahead of the curve, you either
	need a few _devoted_ or a larger, less select group of
	part-time moderators. No matter what, you risk bias.
	Dumb Kid wins.
3. InfoWar
	Several of us succeed in inconveniencing _one_
	person's computer, which he only uses for childish games.
	Dumb kid spams _thousands_ of people who use computers
	in their daily lives.
	Dumb Kid still wins.
4. Appeal to an ISP
	The ISP (kindly) terminates Dumb Kid's account.
	Dumb Kid gets another ISP.
The only effective solution I can see has serious moral implications:
5. The Evil Answer
	The Imperial^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HFederal Communications Commision
	has _tons_ of people in button-down suits waiting to step
	all over some little guy.
	What Dumb Kid has done has legal precedant:
		harassment, malice, misrepresentation
	This _would_ be an effective, _permanent_ deterrent.
	Only problem is "...once you walk down the dark path,
		forever does it control your destiny..."
	(I hate myself for even suggesting it)
