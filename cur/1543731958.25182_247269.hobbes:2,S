Hello,
I tried to boot my root partition (Softwareraid Stripeset) 
with 2.6.9-rc1-mm1 kernel but on fsck.reiserfs
the system stops working and compain about a unresolveable filesystem error
which can't be corrected. I tried to do it manually but no success either.
On start the dmesg output is nearly the same as the one from my old kernel.
No errors while md0 and md1 initialized also the ReiserFS Superblock was
found.
So I went back to my 2.6.8.1 kernel and everything works perfectly.
Does someone get the same error while using ReiserFS v3.6 with
2.6.9-rc1-mm1?
Please CC me while I'm not registred to the mailing list
Thanks in advance
Michael
