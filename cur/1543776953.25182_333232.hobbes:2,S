They will, the overhead of adding debugfs support is _very_ tiny, only:
 $ size fs/debugfs/built-in.o 
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   2257     788       8    3053     bed fs/debugfs/built-in.o
So I do not see why you should not just drop your fs part.

Shouldn't be.  Try it to make sure though :)
