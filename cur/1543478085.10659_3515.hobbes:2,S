The speed of RSA is irrelevent for short messages (RSA is usually only
used for a random session key). For long messages RSA would be useless
because a) it leaks information b) it's very slow.
From what I read, this alg was 'proven' as secure as RSA. Which means A is
still an issue. Also, it doubles the size of the data output, making it
useless for large data sets anyways.
Check out elgamml as used in GPG.
