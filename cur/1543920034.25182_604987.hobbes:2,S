It is a bit naive for you to believe you can remove your GPL
distributed work from the internet by deleting it from your server.
If your kernel driver work would be merged into the kernel it
would retain your copyrights and Signed-off-by: attributions,
so it would be visible for everyone that it is your work. If
you can't live with that, then why on earth did you join a
project developing software released under the GPL? Why did
you release your own software under the GPL?
Since you seem obsessed with keeping control over your
work it is funny that you mention BSD, as the BSD license
is even less restrictive than the GPL.
