I am having some problems with the cs4232 sound driver.  When I load it after
booting with the "modprobe cs4232 dma=1 dma2=0 irq=5 io=0x530" it won't work
and will just make the speakers click and give the following error messages:
Feb 26 20:34:18 lyta kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
However if after loading the module I unload it and then load it a second time
it will work fine.  I have tested doing a clean boot and loading the module
twice (sound then works) and I have tested loading it and attempting to play
music (with bad results) and then doing an unload/load sequence which results
in it working.
Now after I have played one complete track with mpg123 the problem will recurr
and the only way to fix it is to unload and reload the driver.  Basically to
have the cs4232 driver working in my system I have to unload/load it for every
program.
If someone has any idea of what the problem could be then I would really
appreciate any help in tracking this down.
The computer in question is an IBM Thinkpad model 380XD from June 1998.
For reference the Sound Blaster driver works fine every time (although it
complains at insmod time about the card not being fully SB compatible).
The reason that I am not satisfied with just using SB emulation is that I want
to record audio and the SB driver doesn't seem to allow this.
