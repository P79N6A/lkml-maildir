If you are updating it, you hold the lock. That way you can't
be racing with another update. Secondly, changing max_fds
would require allocating a new fdtable structure and
updating ->fdt to point to the new structure, all under
the files_struct lock. The lock-free readers may see the
older fdtable which is kept around until the RCU grace
period is over. That makes it safe.
