well.. is anyone using 2.4.2X mainline on s390, or is ibm making their
s390 customers use vendor kernels instead? 
(the people brave enough to not use those kernels might very well be
using 2.6 by now)
Just trying to get a feeling for who if anyone will benefit inclusion of
such patches, because if that is "just about nobody" then they might
well not be worth the risk.
