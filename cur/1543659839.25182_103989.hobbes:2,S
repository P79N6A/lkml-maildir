Subject: [PATCH] (1/3) i2c-isa, via686a and w8378x series sensors support for 2.5.58
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/16/167

Hello Linus,
These 3 patches provide support for the Pseudo ISA adapter (i2c-isa),
the VIA 686A Integrated Hardware Monitor (via686a) and Winbond W8378x series
(w83781d) sensors.
Both sensors depend on i2c-isa.
The added files are modified versions of the ones found in the lm_sensors-2.7.0
package and were ported by me with help from Christoph Hellwig to the new driver model.
This patch (1/3) adds /drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-isa.c and adds it to Kconfig and Makefile
in the same dir.
Please apply.
Thanks,
	GertJan
