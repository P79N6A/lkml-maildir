A whitelist is an awkward solution, the problem is the number of
chipsets available with MSI will continue to grow. And the assumption
is that after Microsoft OS supports MSI, that newer chipsets will work.
So by having a whitelist, you force a growing whitelist (in the kernel)
to know about all the possible chipsets.  Since non-whitelisted systems
will end up using INTX and working fine, most users will never try MSI
and the whitelist will end up stale.
A better solution is to have more robust IRQ management that can
deal with misrouted IRQ's and try and recover correctly. How hard would
it be to:
	* remember original IRQ before MSI was enabled
	* make sure all MSI irq's are not flagged SHARED
	* in case of bogus IRQ walk the list and try and correct
	  the problem by reverting to INTX mode.
	* add interface?
		pci_request_irq_msi(pdev, regular_irq_handler, msi_irq_handler, flags, name, context)
All this should be done by the MSI layer, not the device drivers.
