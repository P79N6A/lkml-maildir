I can't get the radeon framebuffer working.
If I use plain kernel 2.4.18, it doesn't work at all, it says
"cannot map FB"
(complete kernel-output:
Jun  2 19:55:35 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: ref_clk=2700, ref_div=60, xclk=16600 from BIOS
Jun  2 19:55:35 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: panel ID string: 1024x768                
Jun  2 19:55:35 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: detected DFP panel size from BIOS: 1024x768
Jun  2 19:55:35 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: cannot map FB
)
If I use kernel-2.4.18-pre9-ac3 with vga=ask and vga=normal, I get the same error.
If I use an explicit graphics-mode (e.g. vga=791), the screen is just black (X Starts, but I don't have a console).
My card is a Radeon Mobility M6 LY.
All kernels are with radeon framebuffer compiled in as the only framebuffer.
Any idea what is wrong?

Hanno
