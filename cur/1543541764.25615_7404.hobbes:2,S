Oops, in that case the "files as directories" idea is quite dead, it 
simply won't work with NTFS.

The disadvantage of this is that it won't be possible to do 
"xv file/icon.xpm" anymore.  You're right in that it's probably
the cleanest solution, but it's also the solution that will require
the most changes to existing tools to allow them to operate
on the alternate streams.
I guess I can't have the cake and eat it too :-(
