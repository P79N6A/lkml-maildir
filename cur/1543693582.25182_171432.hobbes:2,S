No, that's not the point.  For people who are already using either driver,
there's no need to change anything between 2.4 and 2.6.  It's only the
foolish people who compile both as modules that have a problem.
If you change the sym2 driver to have a different module name, now people
have to change when they switch between 2.4 and 2.6.  That's bad.
We've had this problem all through 2.4 and it's never been an issue
until now.  I really think this is one problem which shouldn't be fixed.

It works perfectly fine with the drives I have access to under 2.6 ...

Please don't apply this patch.
