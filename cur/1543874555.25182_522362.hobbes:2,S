No can do. Think level-triggered. You *need* to disable the interrupt, and 
disabling it at the CPU is the easiest approach. Even so, you need to 
worry about SMP and screaming interrupts at all CPU's, but if you don't 
ack it to the IO-APIC until later, that should be ok (alternatively, you 
need to just mask-and-ack the irq controller).

One of the advantages of doing that is that you only ever have a queue of 
one single entry, which then makes it easier to do the replay.
