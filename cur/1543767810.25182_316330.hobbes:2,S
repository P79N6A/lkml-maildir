FWIW I'm definitely interested in some sort of pull mechanism where I 
can say "pull from foo://.../libata-2.6.git/HEAD-for-linus" also.
With my netdev-2.6 queue, and given git's intrinsic abilities, I am 
planning to keep all ~30 or so mini-branches in a single git tree.  When 
I am ready to push some upstream, I can do a HEAD-for-linus merge tree, 
that merges selected branches.
