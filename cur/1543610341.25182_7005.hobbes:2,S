Hum think I'm going to test this idea out tonight, quick question without
swap at what point would the kernel stop giving memory up for cache
purposes. For example I noticed on Tuesday whist doing a back up of a file
system (in-line tar cd untar) I was left with ~4 Mb left having nearly the
rest of my 2Gb Ram used for cache.
Would this ram be given back to the free pool much more readily?
