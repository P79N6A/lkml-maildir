This is a bit incorrect.
I do -Dsigprocmask=__sigprocmask on user code part of UML. I found that glibc
(at least the one I have) defines sigprocmask as weak symbol, but there is
__sigprocmask already that has same address as sigprocmask.
Also this does not work for dynamic build for some reason.

Yeah, someone please come up with the better way. Please!
