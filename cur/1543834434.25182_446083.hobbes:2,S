Same here with both the master and next branch of git.  rsync as
suggested by Johannes Weiner works.  You can change the protocol
back to git in .git/remotes/origin after cloning; pulling small
changes seems to work fine.
strace tells me that safe_read at pkt-line.c:111 gets only 305 of
the expected 996 bytes and then dies.  I have no idea how that
might happen. :-/
Pulling the git repository works using the git protocol, btw.
