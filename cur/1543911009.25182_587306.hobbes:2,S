Hmm.. I don't know ( added netdev to Cc ) I got one more :
...
WARNING: "div64_64" [net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.ko] has no CRC!
...
Btw when modprobing these the kernel gets tainted
...
[ 5498.536055] nf_conntrack version 0.5.0 (10240 buckets, 40960 max)
[ 5498.554844] xt_connbytes: no version for "div64_64" found: kernel tainted.
