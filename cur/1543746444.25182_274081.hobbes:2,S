The de4x5 driver supports some older revisions of the tulip chipset
which aren't supported by the tulip driver. I guess it could be made to
support those, too, but nobody did that up to now.
You can actually see the difference on older Alphas: de4x5 works while
tulip doesn't transmit or receive a single packet (getting netdev
watchdogs later on...).
