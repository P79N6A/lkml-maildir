This has nothing to do with the visor or other usb-serial drivers.  It
looks like you have either a flaky USB connection, or a power issue on
your USB hub.  Either way, the device keeps disconnecting itself
electronically (nothing Linux can do about that) and then reconnecting
itself.  Not good.
Is this connected to a powered hub?  If not, I'd recommend using one, or
getting a new keyboard/mouse as this is on the fritz.
thanks,
