Hello,
I have reported the problem few days ago regarding NFS time-out (I guess)
using a 2.2.5ac1 against a knfsd 1.2/2.2.5ac1 server.
In my test (iozone), I am running at the same time 3 iozones from
different clients (whether Linux 2.2.5ac1, Solaris 2.5.1, FreeBSD 2.2.?)
against different files on the Linux 2.2.5ac1 NFS server.
All tests succeed except on the Linux box. Even only 2 Linux 2.2.5ac1
clients end up with one of the two failing (the other one succeeding).
That's quite easy to repeat.
Right now, I have not the details of the mount options.
PS : one 2.2.5ac1 client is quite as fast as a FreeBSD machine (I'd
     hoped that it would have been better, but as fast is not so bad :-)
A+
