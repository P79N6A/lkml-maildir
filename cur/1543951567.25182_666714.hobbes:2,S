Its the dream for the lxfb and gxfb to own the graphics hardware
completely (at least, thats what Jim Gettys keeps pounding in to my
brain), but we're not quite there yet.  What we have here are 
framebuffer drivers that are intelligent enough to save and restore the
state of the graphics engine, which is still a lot better then most other
drivers.

We would be screwed.  But since the Geode has built in graphics logic,
it doesn't make much sense to use an external card, so we'll mostly
avoid this problem.  But even if it happens, we'll have the VT switch
available in a pinch.

Conservation of energy.  Its easier to make 3 or 4 drivers opt out of 
VT switching, rather then hacking 64 other drivers to opt in.  Hopefully
more people will fix their drivers and make this statement false.. :)
