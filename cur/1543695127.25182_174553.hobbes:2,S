With a lot of laptops this is a huge problem. Its one of the reasons Red
Hat went back to 100Hz in the RH 2.4 tree. With many laptops your clock
becomes junk at 1Khz. It will be interesting to see if the ACPI timers
help but that wont solve things for older laptops.
BTW another one for the list might be the SiS IRQ routing fixes from 2.4
if not merged otherwise newer sis and some older intel wont work
properly.
