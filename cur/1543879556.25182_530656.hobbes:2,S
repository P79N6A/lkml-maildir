I'm not worried at all by O(log(n)) algorithms, and generally prefer smart log(n)
than dumb O(1).
In a userland TCP stack I started to write 2 years ago, I used a comparable
scheduler and could reach a sustained rate of 145000 connections/s at 4
millions of concurrent connections. And yes, each time a packet was sent or
received, a task was queued/dequeued (so about 450k/s with 4 million tasks,
on an athlon 1.5 GHz). So that seems much higher than what we currently need.
