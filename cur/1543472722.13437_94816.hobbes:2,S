Personally I'd say that you should write random values a few times in
a row.
In your case, you're overwriting a zero bit with a zero in 50% of the
"write random data" passes. On a 1G disk, that means that after three
"write random data" passes (interleaved with write zeroes or not),
about 128 Mb worth of bits has simply been overwritten with "0" once.
Not good. 
Thinking about it, I guess that "fixed pattern" overwriting is better.
Even better would be to do:
	write random pattern.
	write inverse of the previous random pattern.
	write non-random pattern.
	write inverse of previous pattern. 
repeat (preferably: twice). 
Note that you really should use a real random pattern. Not a pseudo
random one. Recovering a bit that has been overwritten a few times is
MUCH harder if you don't know the intermediate values.
"Drive savers" (expensive company doing data recovery (*) ) told me they
couldn't even read through data that was overwritten once. "Only the
guys in the black suits have that kind of technology".

Commercial plug: 
(*) Call me first if you have a problem: BitWizard will recover
exactly the same amount of data as DriveSavers in most cases.
