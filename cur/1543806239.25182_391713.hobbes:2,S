As opposed to? That's not a rhetorical question, please don't blow it 
off, what is the way for a user to go from /dev/sg0 to find out what 
device is really there?
What is not easily available in Linux is a nice single place to find out 
what mass storage (disk/optical/floppy/ZIP/LS120/tape) devices are on 
the system, and what the system calls them. Because for low tech users 
udev is the problem, not the solution. The user doesn't want to tell the 
system what to call the device, he wants to see what's there, and that 
includes serial numbers of drives (where available) because if a user 
has several drives it's likely that they are identical.
Telling the users to "cat /proc/scsi/scsi" and
  for n in /proc/ide/hd?; do echo -n "$n: "; cat $n/model; done
is not a substitute for a presentation useful to programs and people 
alike. It could be in /proc or /sys or wherever is flavor of the day, 
but it would sure make things easier for the users. And before someone 
suggests that a program could generate this, a program would constantly 
chase the changing presentation of the information, a documented "file" 
in /proc or /sys would allow all applications to look in one place for 
the information.
Instead of having the user tell the system what to call a device, let 
the system tell the user what it is called. Then the kernel could change 
without breaking anything in application land.
