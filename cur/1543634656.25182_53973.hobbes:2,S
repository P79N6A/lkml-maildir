Hi,
I am using redhat7.3 (kernel 2.4.18-3). When I tried to insert a
kernel module, I got the following warning message:
"Warning: loading mymodule.o will taint the kernel: forced load"
I didn't see this problem when I inserted the module to some earlier
version kernels, such as 2.4.15. Does anybody know what does the warning
message mean and how can I modify my module code to avoid that?
Thanks in advance.
Qin
