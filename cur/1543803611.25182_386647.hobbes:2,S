Only small patches can be read directly....

Twice? It depends on the lock nesting depth. The number of task
switches is the lock nesting depth in any blocking down() operation.
In all other implementations the number of task switches is just 1.
I.e is the usual case (task A blocks on  lock 1 owned by B, which is
unblocked), where lock nesting depth is 1, there is no penalty with my
approach. The panalty comes at (task A blocks on lock 1 owned by B,
blocked on lock 2 owned by C). There B is scheduled as an agent to boost
C, such that A never touches lock 2 or task C. Precisely this makes the
spinlocks a lot easier to handle.
On the other hand the maximum time spent with preemption off is
O(1) in my implementation whereas it is at least O(lock nesting depth) in
other implementations. I think the current implementation in rt_preempt
is max(O(total number of PI waiters),O(lock nesting depth)).
