So in case my vote counts, add my vote too :)  .

We are experimenting some patches to see if sending the i_size parameter
to page_cache_readahead() can help or not. There are couple of
advantages in doing that. (1) Quick ramp-up to max-readahead pages for
sequential workload. (2) being able to read atleast the requested number
of pages in one shot instead of reading one page at a time in case the
readahead window gets closed.
But the biggest performance boost has been seen with large max-readahead
window sizes. Currently most of the underlying block devices default to
32 pages max-readahead  even though the underlying device can handle
much larger reads. We could extract much more sequential read
performance if the max-readahead was set to much higher values like 256
pages which most modern devices are capable off. The problem AFAICT is
that the block device layer defaults the max-readahead value for most
block devices to 32, without consulting the capability of the underlying
block device driver.
