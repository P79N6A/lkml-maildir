Hmm.. ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL failed with timeout.  To me it seems that 
your TSST dvdw doesn't like being poked continuously.  I'm not sure how 
HAL is currently poling but it seems each poll involves opening and 
closing thus invoking whole media revalidation and medium removal 
disallow/allow switching.  You're not the first one reporting similar 
problem.  Can you report it to HAL people?  I'd love to talk with them.
Thanks.
