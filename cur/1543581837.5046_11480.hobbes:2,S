Possibly at fs/buffer.c:end_buffer_io_async?
We need to flush the cache when I/O was READ or READA.  Is there any
way for end_buffer_io_async to distinguish which I/O (READ or WRITE)
has been done?
--------------------------------------
Problem with write-back cache.
(1) Page got swapped out
           Swap out
   [ Disk ] <---- P [ Page ]
(2) Page got swapped in asynchronously, possibly by read-ahead
           Swap in
   [ Disk ] ----> P [ Page ]
	          K
   The I/O from disk goes through kernel virtual address K.
   We have cache entries indexed by K.
(3) Page fault occurs at user space U
   [ Disk ]       P [ Page ] <----- U
		  K
   The control goes to do_swap_page, found the page at
   lookup_swap_cache.
   If K and U indexes differently, we have cache alias issues, 
   we need to flush the entries indexed by K.
