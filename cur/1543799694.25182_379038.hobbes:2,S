Hi everybody, and seasons greetings,
I was reading up on the web, and saw that BIOS `video shadowing' isn't 
required with modern kernels, as the kernel talks direct to the hardware 
bypassing BIOS.  I was aware of this re boot time, and know that kernel 
queries hardware direct - but didn't know this bit.
I have an KT7 mobo with award BIOS (version year 2000) and GeForce4 MME with 
nVidia 'secret squirrel' module [kernel 2.6.14.4], so turned off video 
shadowing.
Now, glxgears (I know it not a measurement tool, but...) runs at an amazing 
400fps faster (it was 750ish, now runs at 1100ish in same environment).
So, my question is - are there any documentation that covers what is needed 
and isn't needed in setting up optimum BIOS settings for Linux kernels?
Regards,
Nick
