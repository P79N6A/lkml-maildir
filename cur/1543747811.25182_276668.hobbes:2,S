I looked at ALSA driver CVS a couple of days ago to see if anything has 
changed since the last release (included in 2.6.10-rc1+). The only thing 
significant that I found in the CVS intel8x0 driver, which added 
pci_disable_device() calls, didn't seem to help the resume problem when 
I applied this change to my kernel sources.
