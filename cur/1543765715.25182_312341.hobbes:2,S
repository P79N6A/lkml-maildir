This idea has been discussed around here a couple of times, and the
consensus is that it is a bad idea: IP (and upper protocol) processing
is not expensive, if done right, so this really doesn't buy much; this
forces a particular interface to networking into the kernel, loosing
flexibility that way is always bad; there is no access to futzing
around in between (for example, for firewalling and such); and if the
"hardware implementation" has bugs, you are screwed.
