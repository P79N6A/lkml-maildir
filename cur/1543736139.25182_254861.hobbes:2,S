Hi Andrew,
Here is the fix for dio_new_bio() BUG() with fsx tests.
The problem is, I changed dio_pages_in_io calculation to
be exactly the number of pages we needed to map the user-buffer
to do the IO. But with fine-grain alignment (non fs-blocksize),
we may need 2 more pages (ZERO_PAGE) to zero out first and last
block if needed.
Here is the patch to fix the problem.
Here is the bug info.

Thanks,
Badari
