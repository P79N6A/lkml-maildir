Subject: Mounting UnixWare vxfs Partitions/Slices on Linux 2.6?

All,
I am trying to mount UnixWare slices on Linux 2.6 and I see that the kernel I am running has the following configured:
CONFIG_UNIXWARE_DISKLABEL=y
My system currently has a few logical disks which have UnixWare slices on them (vxfs), and when I try to mount these, I only see a single partition (sdd4 for e.g.) that says GNU HURD or SYSV (which is expected).  And I do not see any other device under /dev that might pertain to the UnixWare slices.  My questions:
1.   What does configuring in the unixware slice support in Linux mean, w.r.t devices in /dev?
2.   How do I mount these slices, I have freevxfs support.
Thanks in advance for any pointers,
-Deepak
