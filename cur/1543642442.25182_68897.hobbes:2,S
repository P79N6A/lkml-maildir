trivial:  I'd be inclined to use:
void iowait_schedule()
{
	atomic_inc(...);
	schedule();
	atomic_dec(...);
}
less trivial: there are times when an io wait is deliberate:
in the context of balance_dirty_pages(), and (newly) in the
context of page reclaim when current->backing_dev_info is
non-zero.
Given that this is a deliberate throttling sleep, perhaps it
should not be included in the accounting?   That way we only
account for the accidental, undesirable sleeps, and reads
and such.
