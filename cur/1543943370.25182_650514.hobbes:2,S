So ... instead of listing "From:" as just another tag, I'd think it would
work if this one was listed in a separate section, perhaps at the end of this
Documentation/patch-tags document, such as:
From:	In addition to the above tags, one can also specify the original author
	of the change, who will end up as the commit author, with a special marker
    	at the top (very first line) of the patch, with a "From:" line.  See further
	Documentation/SubmittingPatches for usage of this "From:" line.
Question -- should this documentation of patch-tags be in its own file,
or added to Documentation/SubmittingPatches.  If it remains in its own
file, then perhaps Documentation/SubmittingPatches should have a reference
to Documentation/patch-tags added.
