Yep, you're not missing anything. That was my complain about the fact
GFP_KERNEL not failing will obviously dealdock the kernel all over the place.
Ingo's point is that the underlined line won't ever happen in the first place
because of the resource accounting that will tell the upper layer that they
can't try to allocate anything, so they won't enter kmalloc at all. But he's
obviously not talking about 2.4.x. (and I'm not sure if that's the right
way to go in the general case but certainly it's the right way to go for
special cases like skbs with gigabit ethernet)
In 2.4.x GFP_KERNEL not failing is a deadlock as you said.
