Hi,
 I got an interesting problem with my USB-mouse:
 If I boot into runlevel 2 and do a 'cat /dev/input/mouse0' and
 move the mouse I got that binary garbage, which shows the mouse
 is working.
 Then I start X (XFree86 v.:4.01) which starts -- so it sees 
 something like a "mouse" (otherwise the server will stop 
 immediately), but I am not able to move the cursor.
 Back on the console again I did this cat thing again, and
 it doesn't work anymore.
 Sometimes after boot, I need not to start X to disable mouse support...
 No oops or other logs...
 Same configuration works with 2.4.0-test8
 modules are:
  mousedev                4032   1
  usbmouse                1872   0 (unused)
  input                   3520   0 [mousedev usbmouse]
  usb-uhci               21424   0 (unused)
  usbcore                50144   0 [usbmouse usb-uhci]
 Mouse is: Logitech M-UB48
 Any idea ?
 Thanks in advance for any help!!!
  keep hacking the right site of life ! :-)
