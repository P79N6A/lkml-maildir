Or maybe we need something much less formal that explain the purpose of the
four tags we use:
Signed-of-by:
Acked-by:
Reviewed-by:
Cc:
Tested-by:
OK - make it five then. I continously to see people mixing up especially
Acked-by: and Signed-of-by: both here at lkml but especially at the
arm-kernel list (the only other Linux dev list I follow atm). I do
beleive we see similar pattern in the other linux-dev lists where
people are confused by these tags and need a short two line summery for 
each of them.
