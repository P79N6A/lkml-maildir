I use the cdparanoia ripper.  Here's a quote from the 
cdparanoia FAQ (cdparanoia III - alpha 9.8):
  "Note that the native ATAPI driver is supported, but that IDE-SCSI
  emulation works better with ATAPI drives. This is an issue of control;
  the emulation interface gives cdparanoia complete control over the
  drive whereas the native ATAPI driver insists on hiding the device
  under an abstraction layer with poor error handling capabilities. Note
  also that a number of ATAPI drives that do not work at all with the
  ATAPI driver (error 006: Could not read audio) *will* work with
  IDE-SCSI emulation."
That, (and the actual performance difference I experienced)
is about all I know about the reasons behind this problem.    
I also used to read the cdrecord mailing list, and IIRC, Jorg 
Schilling (author of cdrecord, general expert on CD ROM stuff)
is not too impressed with the default Linux driver.  I don't 
remember the details... 
I do hope this gets sorted out properly in 2.5.  Perhaps all 
that's needed is better hints for people as they configure the 
kernel, or an "auto-configure" that actually works for the 90% 
of users who aren't experts on this stuff.
With the 2.5 makefile rewrites this may be easy to do.
Or perhaps the IDE-CD driver should be deprecated, kind of like 
the old disk-only IDE driver?
