I've had a vaguely similar problem with 2.6.0-test5: recently I've been 
compiling KDE over a period of a few days.  The first couple of days I was 
running test4, and everything was fine.  Then I upgraded to test5, and three 
times now I've had particular executables become unusable.  For example, 
yesterday, egrep just stopped working.  This stopped the KDE build, and 
testing it by hand, I found that running "egrep" gave me the error "text 
file busy."  I couldn't find any way of making it work again except a 
reboot.
Today it was "sed" that stopped being runnable with the same error message.  
I didn't try a remount (at the moment, my system is one big / partition.  
Yeah, I know...)  Again, sed didn't become runnable again until I rebooted.
Has anyone else seen this weirdness?  It's vanilla 2.6.0-test5, with 
reiserfs.
