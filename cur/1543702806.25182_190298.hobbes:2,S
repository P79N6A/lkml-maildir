I'll keep that one in mind as well, thanks Peter.  Mathieu's reply
(earlier in this thread) fixed it for me, i used the config he put in
his mail.  thanks to all of you for your help and insight!
Russell, would it be useful to you if I tracked it down more precisely
anyway? the config mathieu posted worked for me so i didn't look too
deep, but if you'd like me to try and narrow it down so that we know
which io space causes problems on these machines i could do that.
