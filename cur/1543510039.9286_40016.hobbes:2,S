Many thanks for the response!
I have tried 'insmod -f hpfc' and failed again with following messages:
./hpfc: unresolved symbol pci_write_config_byte
./hpfc: unresolved symbol request_region
./hpfc: unresolved symbol __udelay
./hpfc: unresolved symbol kmalloc

Warning: kernel-module version mismatch
	./hpfc was compiled for kernel version 2.2.5-15
	while this kernel is version 2.2.5-15smp
"hpfc" is driver module name.  The driver is tested on UP system already.
I tried again on Intel Viper (8 CPU) system again and did the following:
1, 'make menuconfig'
   - Only thing changed there is to support SMP.
2, 'make dep'
3, recompile the driver with -D__SMP__ define in CFLAG under new system
configuration.
   - with new configuration, driver compiled OK (it failed before the
reconfiguration
     due to some variables are not defined when with -D__SMP__).
4, 'insmod hpfc' 
   - it failed with messgaes:
	./hpfc was compiled for kernel version 2.2.5-15
	while this kernel is version 2.2.5-15smp
5, 'insmod -f hpfc'
   - it failed with the messages shown above.
I am sure that I missed something during the process of compiling or loading
driver but just don't know what.  
Adding "#include <asm/smp.h> and <asm/spinlock.h>" in driver code doesn't
help either.
My system related CFLAG define: CFLAGS  = -O -D__SMP__ -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE
Could anyone help on this issue please!!!
Many thanks!

Temporary fix, use `insmod -f` to force it to load.
