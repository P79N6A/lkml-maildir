Have you tried using non-blocking sockets ?
I've been doing some network programming myself lately, and my apps 
have no problem handling a sustained load of 40 connections/second -
which should handle your testcase in 25 seconds. And I'm quite sure it
will be less, because it has handled peak loads of several hundred
connections per second.
But my program uses non-blocking sockets exclusively.
