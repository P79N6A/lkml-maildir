At first I thought I would clean up the drivers a little moving common
code from the release routine.  The release code is not called in the
example you gave because of the fork, correct ?
Then I realised what happens if several processes all request SIGIO
notification on different descriptors.  The driver still needs to keep
a private list of all the processes registered with it.  struct file
should at best contain a pointer back to the relevant structure in the
driver private list for cleanup ?
