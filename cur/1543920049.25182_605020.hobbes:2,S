/home is mounted with the following options:
   /dev/mapper/vglinux1-lvhome on /home type reiserfs (rw,noatime,nodiratime,user_xattr)
I guess that beagled (the Beagle desktop search daemon) has populated user
xattrs on almost all files. Now, when I delete a file, two BUGs occur
and the system hangs. Here is the stack for the first BUG (the second
one is very similar):
[partially hand copied stack]
_fput
fput
reiserfs_delete_xattrs
reiserfs_delete_inode
generic_delete_inode
generic_drop_inode
iput
do_unlinkat
sys_unlink
sys_enter_past_esp
I reported a similar BUG in 2.6.22-rc8-mm2 (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/27/235
). Dave Hansen sent a patch for it, I
tested it and it was OK for 2.6.22-rc8-mm2.
I tried this patch on 2.6.23-mm1, and it fixed the BUGs here too.

The bug is caused by reiserfs creating a special 'struct file' with a
NULL vfsmount.  
/* Opens a file pointer to the attribute associated with inode */
static struct file *open_xa_file(const struct inode *inode, const char
*name,
                                 int flags)
{
...
        fp = dentry_open(xafile, NULL, O_RDWR);
        /* dentry_open dputs the dentry if it fails */
As Christoph just said, this is somewhat of a bandaid.  But, it
shouldn't hurt anything.
