Is this problem specific to the 2.4 series or is the 2.2 NFS implementation
suspect to this as well.  I am curious because we have a good number of SMP
servers running SuSE's 2.2.19 kernel connected to a NetApp filer via GigE
with jumbo frames and have not had any problems during development.
However, we are about 1 month from going production and load will increase
tremendously then (even though we've attempted to stress the system in
development, real production always introduces new loads).
Anyway, If this is a known problem with 2.2 as well I may reconsider leaving
jumbo frames enabled.
Thanks,
Tom
