It fails silently after unpacking the kernel.
Sorry, I was insufficiently clear on that.
So far I have tried:
  Disabling all module functions
  Disabling APIC
  Recompiling for 386 rather than K7
  Disabling all special video options (Framebuf,  video mode select)
I have yet to try a completely minimal 386 config, that is my next step,
then I start putting printk()'s in to localise the hang more effectively.
