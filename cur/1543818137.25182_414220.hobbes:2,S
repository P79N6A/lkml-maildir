Yeah, I follow your thinking, and was about to do the same thing, until
I consulted the book of armaments, in this case, the MP Spec. ver. 1.4.
Section 4.3.2, Bus Entries, Bus ID:
"An integer that identifies the bus entry.  The BIOS assigns identifiers
starting at zero, sequentially."
Given this, I considered the kernel adequate.  Nevertheless, your patch is a good
defensive programming method against buggy BIOS's.  I haven't actually tested it,
but it looks like it'll be okay.
