Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: syscall error test incorrect for 64 bits results
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi !
The syscall return path on ppc64 checks if the error is between
-LAST_ERRNO and 0, if it is, does the usual inversion along with
setting a CR bit indicating to glibc that an error occured.
However, we had an interesting bug where we used a 32 bits logica
(unsigned) comparison, thus possibly doing false positives for
valid 64 bits unsigned values whose low 32 bits happen to be in
the error range.
This patch fixes that.
