insmod doesn't require modules to be in /lib/modules.  Anyway I could even change
the device name _after_ it was loaded.  this is linux and not BSD..
Given that we really want to fine-grained control who's netdevice can get what
names we'd` better place a hook in dev_alloc_name.
And that's my whole point: LSM adds random hooks all over the place without
even thinking what they intend to protect.
