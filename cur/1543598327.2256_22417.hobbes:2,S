Hello all,
If you mount a device like ide-cdrom with the scsi-emulation turned on
(as modules) and you do the same mount again on the same (not unmounted)
device, the mount-programm hangs up and never comes back. It doesn't
recognize, that the device is allready mounted.
If I do a simple "mount", mount lists the /cdrom - device as mounted.
Problem: if you want to unmount the device, mount tells that the device
would be bussy and ends. So, you've no chance to unmount the device
again. The only way to unmount it, is to do a hardware reset (a normal
reboot doesn't work, because mount hangs at the cdrom-device).
Kernel 2.4.9 is working fine.
> mount --version
mount: mount-2.11h
Regards,
Andreas Hartmann
