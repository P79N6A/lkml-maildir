Subject: [patch 0/5] fuse fixes for 2.6.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/24/157

These are mostly fixes, there's one small cleanup and a protocol
update, that should go with rest of the protocol changes in the
previous submission.
Thanks,
Miklos
