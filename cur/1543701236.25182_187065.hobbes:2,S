When switching to 2.6.0 my Starfire NIC fails to function with an 
entertaining message:
Dec 23 16:36:45 job kernel: eth0: Something Wicked happened! 0x02018101.
Dec 23 16:36:45 job kernel: eth0: Something Wicked happened! 0x02010001.
I don't know if this is related but in 2.4 I get PCI bus congestion for 
the starfire adapter:
eth0: PCI bus congestion, increasing Tx FIFO threshold to 80 bytes
eth0: PCI bus congestion, increasing Tx FIFO threshold to 96 bytes
eth0: PCI bus congestion, increasing Tx FIFO threshold to 112 bytes
eth0: PCI bus congestion, increasing Tx FIFO threshold to 128 bytes
eth0: PCI bus congestion, increasing Tx FIFO threshold to 144 bytes
eth0: PCI bus congestion, increasing Tx FIFO threshold to 160 bytes
