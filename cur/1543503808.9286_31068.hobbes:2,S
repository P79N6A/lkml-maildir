Do you mean the super socket 7 hell?
I am have to access host and isa bridges to setup/identify capablity of
these ide-chipsets.  One of them is so bad that I have to determine the
revision of the isa-bridge to decide the feature limits of the ide
host-adapter, or determine the identity of the host-host device to try and
guess the setep of the isa-bridge lot/stamp.
The other chipset vender places a double ident chipset with two level of
access.  The two possible isa-bridge devices must be detected to determine
the features list.  If you get the one with latest bridge, you still have
to access the lower bridge to setup the ide host-adapter.  Oh did I forget
to mention that the irq routing table for the IDE is only settable in the
isa-bridge, or that you have to dork with a few bits to disable the pnp
simplex block.
It gets worse, now that I have a broader insight into the madness.
Is this familar?
