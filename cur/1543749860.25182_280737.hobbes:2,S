enqueue is only protected by dev->queue_lock, and dev->queue_lock
is dropped as soon as dev->xmit_lock is grabbed, so any other CPU
might call enqueue at the same time.
Example:
CPU1					CPU2
dev_queue_xmit				dev_queue_xmit
  lock(dev->queue_lock)			 lock(dev->queue_lock)
q->enqueue
qdisc_run
qdisc_restart
  trylock(dev->xmit_lock), ok
  unlock(dev->queue_lock)
...
printk("something")
...
netpoll_send_skb
  trylock(dev->xmit_lock), fails
q->enqueue				q->enqueue

Sure, but I think we should have a short-term workaround until
a better solution has been invented. Maybe dropping the packets
would be best for now, it only affects printks issued in paths
starting at qdisc_restart (-> hard_start_xmit -> ...). Queueing
the packets might also cause reordering since not all packets
are queued.

Hmm this is complicated, let me think some more about it.
