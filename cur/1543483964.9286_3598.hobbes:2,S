I have some good news for you: the world of configuration is moving in
the direction that you want.  Because lots of other people want this, too.
Check out Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt in 2.2.2-pre1.
It's far from perfect but we now have a written specification for
Config Language.
Also, you don't even have to write a parser; you can use my parser
and drop your back-end code into it.  Here it is:
    
ftp://ftp.shout.net/pub/users/mec/experimental/mconfig-0.14.tar.bz2
Jim Bray is working on gtk-mconfig.  I am focussed on 2.2.X and I won't
be working on this any more until some time after the 2.3.0 split.
This ought to make web-based configuration a much more approachable
project.
Also there's a mailing list for all kinds kernel building issues:
    linux-kbuild@torque.net
    linux-kbuild-request@torque.net
It's a Majordomo list; send a "subscribe" line if you want to join.
