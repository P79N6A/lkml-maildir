I'm back and  things are still upside down here.
You have not DMA......I remember now.
There are several PIIX4 setups that fail to setup the pci-config space
correctly.  I am working on some chipset tuning code as of now. 
There are a few bits that need to be set in order for the chipset
to kick into high gear.  I have the docs now and the updates.
I have a cleaner method for configuring the drives/devices, but working on
rules for fiddling with pci-space.

Well next was the fire-marshel ordering specific items be changed to
conform to new codes and would not accept a grandfather clause.
There is more, but I am on the trail again and can breathe.
Your case is not unique, there are many reports that I have waded through
to realize that the BIOS on many boards are wacking out.
