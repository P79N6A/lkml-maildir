I don't know about this. The patches add some complexity, I guess because
we now have vmas which cannot communicate the protectedness of the pages.
Still, nobody was too concerned about nonlinear mappings doing the same
for addressing. But this does seem to add more overhead to the common cases
in the VM :(
Now I didn't follow the earlier discussions on this much, but let me try
making a few silly comments to get things going again (cc'ed linux-mm).
I think I would rather this all just folded under VM_NONLINEAR rather than
having this extra MANYPROTS thing, no? (you're already doing that in one
direction).

I think that's silly. Your VM_MANYPROTS|VM_NONLINEAR vmas will cause more
overhead in faulting and reclaim.
It loooks like it would take an hour or two just to code up a patch which
puts a VM_GUARDPAGES flag into the vma, and tells the free area allocator
to skip vm_start-1 .. vm_end+1. What kind of troubles has prevented
something simple and easy like that from going in?

Let's try get back to the good old days when people actually reported
their bugs (togther will *real* numbers) to the mailing lists. That way,
everybody gets to think about and discuss the problem.
