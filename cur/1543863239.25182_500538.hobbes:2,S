Some architecture use 'enum dma_data_direction' and some 'int
dma_data_direction'. The consensus was to move to int over
time. Please use 'int dma_data_direction'.

"write" can mean "write to device" or "write to memory", depending on
context. Not exactly something which should be a generic
helper. Rename to 'dma_to_device(int dir)'?

While this doesn't look very useful. Why is "DMA_NONE" a uni-dir? I
suggest replacing this with an open coded (dir != DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL).
