It's still unclear where noinline does not work (do you have details on that? 
It sounds a little dubious) but there are lots of different other ways to prevent gcc 
from inlining anything.
e.g. you can use stdarg or computed goto or a variable length local array

Details?

No, that just creates another out of line copy.
