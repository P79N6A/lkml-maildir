Sorry, but that __GFP_USER name is still sticking in my craw.
I won't try to reopen my quest to get it named __GFP_REALLY_REALLY_EASY_RCLM
or whatever it was, but instead will venture on a new quest.
Can we get the 'RCLM' in there.  Especially since this term appears
naked in such code as:
> -				page = alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER);
> +				page = alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER|__GFP_USER);
where it is not at all obvious to the reader of this file (fs/exec.c)
that the __GFP_USER term is commenting on the reclaim behaviour of
the page to be allocated.
I'd be happier with:
> +#define __GFP_USERRCLM    0x80000u /* User and other easily reclaimed pages */
> +#define __GFP_KERNRCLM   0x100000u /* Kernel page that is reclaimable */
and:
> -				page = alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER);
> +				page = alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER|__GFP_USERRCLM);
Also the bold assymetry of these two #defines seems to be without motivation,
one with the 'RCLM', and the other with '    ' four spaces.
