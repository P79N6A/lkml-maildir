I'm still using 1.x majordomo just like everyone else. The bottleneck is
not calling external commands (which is primarily calling sendmail for
message delivery, once per message), but in loading and compiling resend,
archive, etc., repeatedly. Resend for some lists may also have to read the
subscriber list to determine whether a post is legitimate, but this is not
an issue for linux-kernel. Free memory helps _a lot_, as do fast disks. 
Running on an, umm, mature SPARC with slow drives and sharing it with the
main CVS repository is probably the problem here..
