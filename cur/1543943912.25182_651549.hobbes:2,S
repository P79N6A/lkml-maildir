It should be called via ata_acpi_{ap|dev}_notify() callbacks installed
via acpi_install_notify_handler().  Can you add dump_stack() in the
function and verify that it actually is being called?  It could be that
the method is called too late or libata takes too long to actually
unplug the device.  Hmmm... It seems what ata_acpi_handle_hotplug() does
isn't enough for undock.  It probably should request detaching the
device instead of just notifying hotplug event.  Anyways, please lemme
know whether and when the function is called.

Yeah, I think most things should be done automatically but it's true
that somethings are a bit awkward to handle in kernel.  Also, if you're
root, you can almost always crash the machine from userland.

Let's see whether we can fix the ACPI handler first.

I'm not too familiar with how docks work.  Can you please explain
briefly what immediate_undock is?
Thanks.
