Our Oracle jobs are almost entirely local (we got rid of all network 
access for performance reasons months ago).  Before the upgrade to 
2.4.4, they were running well enough, but now (with the only change 
being the Suse upgrade from 7.0 to 7.2) they are taking twice as long. 
 I am slightly suspicious of the kernel, as much swapping is happening 
now which was not happening before on an identical workload.  I am 
trying out 2.4.6-2 (from Hubert Mantel's builds) today to see if VM 
behavior improves.
