Well, let's just take the recent "Really Simple Really Fair Scheduler" 
thread. You had the time to ask me questions about my scheduler, I even 
explained to you how the sleeping bonus works in my model. At the end I 
was sort of hoping you would start answering my questions and explaining 
things how the same things work in CFS - but nothing.
Then you had the time to reimplement the very things you've just asked me 
about and what do I get credit for - "two cleanups from RFS".
And now I get this lame ass excuse for not answering my questions? :-(
bye, Roman
