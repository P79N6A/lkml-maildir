Subject: Linux LVM: external CVS access
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/5/16/104

As announced 3 weeks ago, we have set up external CVS write access now.
We hereby kindly invite major contributors like Andreas Dilger to join in :-)
In order to set an account up, please send your address information
(including postal, e-mail, phone and fax contacts) to me.
We reserve the right to decide about who is gained write access.
The decision will be based on just the following criteria:
 - submitter contributes regularly
 - submitter contributes major enhancements and/or bug fixes
In case you are accepted, you'll get all
access information to the server in return.
Please add a PGP key in order to encrypt the account password for you.
Thank you for supporting Linux LVM.
