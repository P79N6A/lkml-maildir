Which, now that I've gone back and looked only has SLAB as the choice in the 
make xconfig.  It did that switch rather silently as I had been using SLUB 
all the way through the 2.6.22-rcN series just to exersize the new option.
In any event, both rt2 and rt3 seem to have that under total control now.  No 
swap is being indicated by htop, and kmail is up to 122 megs.  Uptime with 
rt3 is 8.5 hours now & so far everything is running rather nicely.  Except of 
course for tvtime.  I fwd'd the logs from that to the v4l list, but haven't 
been graced with a reply as yet.
Thanks Peter.
