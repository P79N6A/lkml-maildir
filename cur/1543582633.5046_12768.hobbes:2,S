A rather incomprehensible message, so let's flesh this out a bit.
Basically the problem occurs when patching linux/fs/reiserfs/namei.c It 
can't find it, presumably due to an error in 2.4.1, where it appears to 
me that reiserfs/ is located off of linux/ not linux/fs/. Simple to fix, 
I guess, though this would appear to mean that Linus made a mistake w/ 
2.4.1 (plz correct me if I'm wrong), though it could also be said that 
this means that Alan diff'd the wrong tree (basically a fixed tree in re 
reiserfs/)
/me needs to stop using latin while writing on lk. Maybe too much 
caffeine (just received caffeine candy sampler from ThinkGeek)
