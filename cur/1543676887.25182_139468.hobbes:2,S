Subject: [PATCH] 2.5-bk K&R to ANSI conversions for fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c and jfs_xtree.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch removes the first of the following warnings when doing
make C=1 bzImage with the sparse checker cleverly installed as
/usr/local/bin/sparse.
  CHECK   fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c
warning: fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c:3053:14: non-ANSI parameter list
warning: fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c:1315:10: not addressable
warning: fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c:1792:8: not addressable
warning: fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c:3441:10: not addressable
  CC      fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.o
No "non-ANSI parameter list" warnings for fs/jfs/jfs_xtree.c were
received, presumably because _JFS_WIP wasn't defined.  This patch
converts the xtGather function declaration anyway.
