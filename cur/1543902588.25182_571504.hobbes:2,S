hm, another speedup patch with no measurements which demonstrate its
benefit.

Well there's a tradeoff here.  At large CPU counts, percpu_counter_sum()
becomes quite expensive - it takes a global lock and then goes off fishing
in every CPU's percpu_alloced memory.
So there is some value of (num_online_cpus / sb->s_groups_count) at which
this change becomes a loss.  Where does that value lie?
Bear in mind that the global lock in percpu_counter_sum() will tilt the
scales quite a bit.
