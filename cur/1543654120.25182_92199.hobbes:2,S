thanks for cc'ing the file locking maintainer or the linux-fsdevel
mailing lists.  you know, like it says in MAINTAINERS.  after all, if
you'd done that you might've got a reply telling you it's a known bug,
and even a workaround.  as it is, i have no idea what Dave Olien's email
address is, so i can't send him mail.
i have a patch, it passes the LTP when run on a local filesystem, but
not over NFS which is why I haven't publicised it yet.  Thanks to OSDL
for giving me access to machines to test this kind of thing on.

note, do not use NFS when using this patch.  really; i mean it.  somehow
i managed to corrupt thread_info.cpu causing _udelay_ to oops.
