Hi Andrew
I managed to fix it by running e2fsck off one of the backup 
superblocks - that seems to have repaired the broken bits:

000480 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Then I just reran "tune2fs -j", and mounted it as ext3.  I hope that
was the correct approach, but its working in any case :)  Don't quite
know why/how the superblock got corrupted like that in the first
place :-/
