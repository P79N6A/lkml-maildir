In fact the full context based readahead requires three functions:
        - radix_tree_scan_hole(root, index, max_scan)                                                                   
        - radix_tree_scan_hole_backward(root, index, max_scan)                                                          
        - radix_tree_scan_data_backward(root, index, max_scan)                                                          
I would be very glad if you can work up a consistent naming scheme
for them all ;)

No, changing the return value won't eliminate the wraparound case.
But I guess we can safely assume that it won't wrap around at all?
The last page in the pagecache address space will not be
granted/allocated thanks to the not-too-aggressive MAX_LFS_FILESIZE?
