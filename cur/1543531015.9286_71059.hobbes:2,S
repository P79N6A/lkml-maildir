I haven't got a kernel to compile since 2.3.99-pre1, so I'm unable to
verify whether the tulip patch (which fixes some PCI DMA problems) got
successfully integrated into the kernel.  The patch he sent me earlier has
been working absolutely fine so far, as I'm running 2.3.99-pre1 with the
patch applied.  Network traffic throughput increases dramatically.
Anyway, there is some stuff in 2.3.99-pre1 which is broken, namely smbfs,
which I was hoping to include again in the kernel, but I can't get
anything lately to compile.  
It's my tendency to just wait for the next patch to compile, (what can I
say, I'm lazy), however I'll see if I can find a solution to the compile
error.
I can send a .config if needed.
