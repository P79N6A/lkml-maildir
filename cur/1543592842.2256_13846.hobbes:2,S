Bzzt.  Arrays and pointers are not always equivalent.  This code
defines an area of 4*IFNAMSIZ chars.  The old code then initialised
each IFNAMSIZ chars to the empty string (an array starting with '\0'),
not a pointer to an empty string.  Test file x.c.
#define IFNAMSIZ 7
static char name[4][IFNAMSIZ];
int main(void) { return(0); }
# gcc -g x.c -o x
# gdb x
(gdb) ptype name
type = char [4][7]
(gdb) x name[0]
0x80494f4 <name>:       0x00000000
(gdb) x name[1]
0x80494fb <name+7>:     0x00000000
(gdb) x name[2]
0x8049502 <name+14>:    0x00000000
(gdb) x name[3]
0x8049509 <name+21>:    0x00000000
Zero initialisation via bss works fine.  Try it with 
  static char name[4][IFNAMSIZ] = {"", "", "", ""};
and you get exactly the same results, at the expense of more disk space
and time to load.  Not much extra I know, but it all adds up.
