Yes. 2.0.38 is OK. I just made a patch that seems to work.
Harald, could you try
	ftp.xx.kernel.org/.../people/aeb/linux-2.4.0test9-isofs-patch
and report?
Linus, Alan - I made patches for 2.2 and 2.4 but want to
polish and check them a bit more before submitting.
There also seem to be a lot of bug reports in newsgroups
and mailing lists - must check whether people complain
about the same thing or whether there are more problems.
