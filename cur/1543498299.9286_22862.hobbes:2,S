If you install a distribution that supports 100 SCSI discs, you need
1600 entries in /dev just for that. If you decide you'll never have
more than 4 SCSI discs, you're free to delete the entries you don't
need. One day you plug in a 5th disc (shit happens), and you have to
mknod some devices.
A plain RedHat distribution has 1377 device nodes (and only supports 7
SCSI discs).
