Guess I'll have to take that approach.  The new additions to __switch_to() 
follow a linked list, and obviously it's not safe to do that while the 
list is being updated.  (No, I'm not about to start using RCU for this!)

I see your point.  If you want to monitor a certain location in kernel
space but only while in the context of a specific task, the new framework
doesn't provide any way of doing it.  One approach could be to use a
regular kernel breakpoint and return immediately if the task of interest
isn't the current one.  Beyond that, let's punt.

In practice that might not work.  On my machine, at least, reads of DR6
return ones in all the reserved bit positions.
