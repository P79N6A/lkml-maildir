	I got the same here. Backed out the device-mapper patches Joe 	Thornber
posted here, and now it works. 
	It looks like a problem with the cleanups, at least I didn't see 	any
ioctl interface change? 
Yeah, I got the same. The message is something like 
"ioctl cmd 2 No such address or device".
Joe, do we need to upgrade some tools or something here?
