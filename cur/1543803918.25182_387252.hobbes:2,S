Transparent superpages would certainly be nice. There's already various
superpage implementations floating around, but not without their
drawbacks. You might consider the Shimizu superpage patch for x86 if
you're not too concerned about demotion when trying to swap out the page.
There's some links on this subject on the ia64 wiki:

Alternately, if you're simply interested in cutting down on the page
fault overhead and want a simpler and more naive approach, read the rice
paper and consider something like the IRIX/HP-UX approach (though for
x86, arm, etc. this might be slightly more work, since the larger pages
are at the PMD level, as opposed to other architectures where it's just a
matter of setting some bits in the PTE).
Since this topic seems to come up rather frequently, perhaps it would be
worthwhile documenting some of this on the linux-mm wiki.
