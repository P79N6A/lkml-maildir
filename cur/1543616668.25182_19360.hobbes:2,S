Subject: Unable to boot 2.4.17 via initrd

I have tried for several days to boot 2.4.17 (The last "stable"
kernel) off initrd.
/linuxrc never executes, therefore I am not able to load modules
to start SCSI disks, etc.
I have appended /linux-2.4.17/.config for review. The required SCSI
modules are made and the kernel has, or was configured to have,
initrd support.
This is the tail-end of my existing 'make_initrd' boot script.
I have snipped off all the stuff necessary to make the ram-disk,
etc. This works and has been working before pivot-root changes
were made in the kernel.

[REST SNIPPED]
EOF
The boot messages show:
RAMDISK driver initialized: (with some numbers)
However, I never see the usual,
"RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0"
-- nor do I see anything that would have been executed from /linuxrc
