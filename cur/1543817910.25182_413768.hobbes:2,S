Well, we could in fact hang an unregister off device->private_data as 
per attached example. Wouldn't be _excessively_ ugly. Still sucks 
though. Having a flag somewhere in struct device_driver that a 
platform_driver would set and which would tell the driver model to 
honour the driver probe() method return seems the cleanest approach for 
all hardware where only the driver can now if the device is really 
present or not.
Ofcourse, I'm also still fine with just propagating the error up always 
(and if can be doing something about the ignore of -ENODEV / -ENOXIO)...
Rene.
