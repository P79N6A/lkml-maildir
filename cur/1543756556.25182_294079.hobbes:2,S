Well, I was hoping register handler would do some basic
error checking to prevent user from panicking. For example,
I ran into it untentionally (I moved my code from ia32 to
x86-64, forgot to update the addresses).

I tried to do this earlier in my module, but I get
# insmod myprobe.ko
insmod: error inserting 'myprobe.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
myprobe: Unknown symbol kallsyms_lookup_name
How did you use it ? it looks like kallsyms_lookup_name()
is not exported. Thats the reason why I was hardcoding addresses.
# grep KALL .config
CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y
CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y
CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=y
Thanks,
Badari
