Good evening, all. I've been trying to get 2.5.x to boot up without
losing IDE interrupts.  I tried disabling multimode in makeconfig but to
no avail.
My IDE controller and chipset are as follows (via dmesg):
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci00:07.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA

Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6

    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe008-0xe00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA

hdc: 12594960 sectors (6449 MB) w/256KiB Cache, CHS=13328/15/63,

And /proc/pci reports my chipset as such: 
  Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
    Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C693A/694x [Apollo PRO133x] (rev 196).
      Master Capable.  Latency=8.  
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd0000000 [0xd7ffffff].
  Bus  0, device   1, function  0:
    PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C598/694x [Apollo MVP3/Pro133x AGP] (rev 0).
      Master Capable.  No bursts.  Min Gnt=12.
  Bus  0, device   7, function  0:
    ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super South] (rev 64).
  Bus  0, device   7, function  1:
    IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. Bus Master IDE (rev 6).
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  
      I/O at 0xe000 [0xe00f].

Has anyone else with a Via chipset been able to boot into 2.5.x without having these interrupt problems? Any suggestions will be helpful.
Thanks.
