Subject: SIOCGIFCONF still not working

Some time ago it was reported here the SIOCGIFCONF is not working and
I thing Davem said he'll fix it.  Well, I have 2.3.14 and it still
does not work.  A few functions, and soon more, in glibc depend on
this.
The symptoms are that only one interfaec is reported.  You call
	struct ifconf ifc;
	ifc.ifc_buf = NULL;
	ifc.ifc_len = 0;
	ioctl (fd, SIOCGIFCONF, &ifc);
where fd is an open socket and you get in ifc_len the result 12 (which
means, room for exactly one ifconf entry).
Could somebody please look at this?  I really want to finish the IPv6
support.
Thanks,
