I agree.  I have a patch that at least fixes this bit of capabilities
(currently, what you suggest doesn't work right), which could easily be
dusted off and resent.
And while we're at it, it would be nice to have the working bits of
memlock rlimits going.  At least the mlock() users would get some help
(i.e. gpg).  Another bit I could resend (removing the broken shm bits,
of course).  It's just those pesky shm segs having their own lifecycle
which breaks the hugetlb and SHM_LOCK attempts to use memlock rlimits.
thanks,
