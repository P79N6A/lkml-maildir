Subject: [PATCH 2.6.14-rc1] ppc: prevent GCC 4 from generating AltiVec instructions in kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Depending on how GCC is built, GCC 4 may generate altivec instructions
without user explicitly requesting vector operations in the code.
Although this is a performance booster for user applications, it is a
problem for kernel.
This patch explicitly instruct GCC to NOT generate altivec
instructions while building the kernel.
Here are some test cases I ran.
(1) build gcc 4.0.1 with '--with-cpu=7450 --enable-altivec
--enable-cxx-flags=-mcpu=7450', and use this gcc to build kernel
WITHOUT this kernel patch. Kernel fail to boot up on a 7450 board
because of altivec instructions in kernel.
(2) build gcc 4.0.1 with "--with-cpu=7450 --enable-altivec
--enable-cxx-flags=-mcpu=7450", and use this gcc to build kernel WITH
this kernel patch. Kernel boot up on a 7450 board without any problem.
(3) build gcc 4.0.1 with "--with-cpu=750
--enable-cxx-flags=-mcpu=750", and use this gcc to build kernel with
or without this kernel patch. Kernel boot up on a 7450 board without
any problem.
This patch should also work with GCC 3 or even earlier GCC 2.95.3.
Please review and apply it.
