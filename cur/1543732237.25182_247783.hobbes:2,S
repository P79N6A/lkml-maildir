Thanks for all the replies. I will have to second all that Marcos D.
Marado Torres <marado@student.dei.uc.pt> has said. I did notice that my
post of grub.conf config in the original email lacked the
"root=/dev/hda3" as I had made so many attempts to get it to boot with
other people's suggestions (fat finger:>) Just to ensure full testing I
redid all test inputs "root=/dev/hda3" and also "root=0303" and also
tried a Fedora Core box with the same kernel and initrd with the above
and also a "root=LABEL-/" with the same error. 
Here are both the config file (copied from /proc/config.gz) and the one
I am attempting to get to work (using the same kind of option selection
I know works with my 2.4.x tree.
