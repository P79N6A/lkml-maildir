Coming into this really late, and I'm still behind in reading this and
related threads, but I want to throw this idea out, and it's getting
late.

$ gcc -O2 -o mark mark.c
$ ./mark
func y is in reg B at 0x80483ce
Now the question is, isn't MARK() in this code a non intrusive marker?
So couldn't a kprobe be set at "debug_func" and we can find what
register "y" is without adding any overhead to the code being marked?
Obviously, this would need to be done special for each arch.
