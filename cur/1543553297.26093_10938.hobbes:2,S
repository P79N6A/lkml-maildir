That's not quite true.  gcc 2.96/7 isn't bad.  It's just not intended for use
on production systems.  But, it has a lot of things that people will have to
get used to for gcc 3.0.  It also has a more robust/not-as-sucky C++ abi.
RedHat decided haveing a g++ that sucks less and including more compat
libraries in 7.1/whatever was worth it.  I don't think so, but I'm not RedHat
:)
The idea of kgcc isn't a new one.  It's been around, unoffically, since Linus
said "Ok, I'd recommend people use X compiler".  It's now a more formal idea
and most x86 distributions have one now.
/me is glad he has more PPC boxes then x86 ones.
