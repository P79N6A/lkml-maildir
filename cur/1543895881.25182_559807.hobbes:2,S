wth?  I'm _sure_ we used to have code in there which would, within
do_exit(), work out the maximum amount of kernel stack which a task had
used and if that was max-since-boot, drop a printk.
Maybe I dreamed it, but I don't think so.
I wonder where it went?
Oh well.  Your new code should really be generic, utilising the
stack-page-zeroing which CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE enables.  There's nothing
UML-specific about it.
low_water_lock and lowest_to_date should be static to check_stack_usage(),
btw..
