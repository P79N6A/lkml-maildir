A small detail; you min(x,y) fails if x and y are pointers.
Example: min(char * a, char * b) would evaluate to
char * __x = (a), __y = (b); etc...
Here __x is a pointer and __y is a char. A better solution (at least the
one that has my vote so far) would besomething like this:
typeof(x) __x=(x); typeof(y) __y=(y); (__x < __y) ? __x : __y
