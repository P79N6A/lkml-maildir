OK this is pretty sweet.  With T3 the jitter never exceeds 7% on an idle
system.  As soon as I start moving the mouse this goes to 7 or 8%.  I
cannot get it to go higher than 10%.  Moving windows around has no
effect, the highest jitter happens when I type or move the mouse really
fast IOW it corresponds to the interrupt rate.
This is a pretty good baseline for what an xrun-free system would look
like.  Now to test the latest version...
