I've never seen it.  Is this the test-starve fix I heard mentioned on lkml 
once?

Ingo had me measure impact with lat_ctx, and it wasn't very encouraging 
(and my box is UP).  I'm not sure that I wasn't seeing some cache effects 
though, because the numbers jumped around quite a bit.  Per Ingo, the 
sequence lock change will greatly improve scalability.  Doing anything 
extra in that path is going to cost some pain though, so I'm trying to 
figure out a way to do something ~similar.  (ala perfect is the enemy of 
good mantra).
wrt pit, yeah, that diff won't work if you don't have a tsc.  If something 
like it were used, it'd have to have ifdefs to continue using 
jiffies.  (the other option being only presentable on April 1:)
