I just tried this code:
--- code ---
extern void marker1(void);
extern void marker2(void);
extern void callme(void *p);
#define unlikely(x)     __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
void predictme(void *t)
{
        marker1();
        if (unlikely (t))
                callme(t);
        marker2();
        return;
}
--- end code ---
Compiled it like:
 $ gcc -O2 -c predict.c
Then did objdump and got this:
--- objdump ---
00000000 <predictme>:
   0:   55                      push   %ebp
   1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
   3:   53                      push   %ebx
   4:   83 ec 04                sub    $0x4,%esp
   7:   8b 5d 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%ebx
   a:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   b <predictme+0xb>
                        b: R_386_PC32   marker1
   f:   85 db                   test   %ebx,%ebx
  11:   75 08                   jne    1b <predictme+0x1b>
  13:   58                      pop    %eax
  14:   5b                      pop    %ebx
  15:   5d                      pop    %ebp
  16:   e9 fc ff ff ff          jmp    17 <predictme+0x17>
                        17: R_386_PC32  marker2
  1b:   89 1c 24                mov    %ebx,(%esp)
  1e:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   1f <predictme+0x1f>
                        1f: R_386_PC32  callme
  23:   eb ee                   jmp    13 <predictme+0x13>
--- end objdump --
The jne is expected to fail, so we will always continue to 0x13. Now is
this a problem with x86/x86_64?
BTW: taking out the unlikely I get this:
--- objdump ---

   3:   53                      push   %ebx
   4:   83 ec 04                sub    $0x4,%esp
   7:   8b 5d 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%ebx
   a:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   b <predictme+0xb>
                        b: R_386_PC32   marker1
   f:   85 db                   test   %ebx,%ebx

  13:   89 1c 24                mov    %ebx,(%esp)
  16:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   17 <predictme+0x17>
                        17: R_386_PC32  callme
  1b:   58                      pop    %eax
  1c:   5b                      pop    %ebx
  1d:   5d                      pop    %ebp
  1e:   e9 fc ff ff ff          jmp    1f <predictme+0x1f>
                        1f: R_386_PC32  marker2
--- end objdump ---
So it seems that gcc tries to keep the likely's from jumping.
