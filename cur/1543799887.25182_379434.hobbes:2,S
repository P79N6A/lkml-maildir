Subject: [patch 05/11] mutex subsystem, add include/asm-arm/mutex.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/27/70

add the ARM version of mutex.h, which is optimized in assembly for
ARMv6, and uses the xchg implementation on pre-ARMv6.
