hard drive parking was already sorted out. We have a script that does this
and works great parking the heads.
The problem here is that we have 10 different models.
One will have 20 as X and the others will have 500 as x. Some will increment
in 20 when you move them 45Deg, and some will increment 50.
How can you determine from an shake, to a fall?
