Could we make that comment a little more explicit.  Say:
No need to check that tsk->cpuset != NULL, since cpuset_exit() sets
it to top_cpuset instead.
Comments that refer to a nebulous hack in some other function
a little hard to understand when new, and get really confusing
when the other function changes and it isn't clear what aspect
of that other function the comment depended on and if that property
still exists.
