I would be very careful with this especially on IA64.
If the TLB miss or other low-level trap handler depends upon being
able to dereference thread info, task struct, or kernel stack stuff
without causing a fault outside of the linear PAGE_OFFSET area, this
patch will cause problems.
It will be difficult to debug the kinds of crashes this will cause
too.
