Subject: [ANNOUNCE] SCSI repository move from BK to git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is more or less forced by the fact that the 2.6.12-rc3 is now git
based.  So as of now I won't be updating linux-scsi.bkbits.net
Hopefully I've set up broadly similar functionality on www.parisc-
linux.org (with thanks to Dann Frazier and Paul Bame, the parisc-linux
web admins).
To view the currently available SCSI trees, go to
http://www.parisc-linux.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.pl
This is using Kay Sievers' scripts and should give you broadly similar
browsing capabilities to bkbits.
I'm still pushing the diffs and the change logs for all the trees into
http://www.parisc-linux.org/~jejb/scsi_diffs
which has almost the exact same content as the old BK based ones used to
have.  Since git is a very mobile target at the moment, I suspect the
diffs and the changelogs will be of most use to people.

P.S. if you have any general git questions, please, I don't want to hear
them.  Ask on the git mailing list:  git@vger.kernel.org (preferably
after having searched the archives http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git
first).
