-9 doesn't kill processes in "D" state.
"D" state is a state where they are in the kernel, usually waiting for
IO of some kind of for a semaphore.
The fact that they're stuck is a kernel bug somewhere; to diagnose we
(or probably your OS vendor given you're running a highly antique
kernel) the output of "echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger", and especially the
part of the dump that shows the process in "D" state.
