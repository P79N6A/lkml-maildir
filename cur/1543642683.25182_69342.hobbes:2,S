This looks most likely to be incorrect programming of UDMA registers on
the Promise chip. UDMA is asymmetrical by design - the hd->mb and mb->hd
speeds can be different. If you get correct read rates, it's the
harddrive that's set up correctly, for writes it's the IDE chip that has
to be programmed for the speed.
