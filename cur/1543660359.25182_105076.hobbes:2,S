Hello.
I have a strange problem with 2.4.20 (also 2.4.19) and Qlogic FC 2200.
The machine runs test news-server, so disk load is high.
After few minutes of running I get the following errors on console:
qlogifc0 : no handle slots, this should not happen
hostdata->queued is 19, in_ptr: 63
qlogifc0 : no handle slots, this should not happen
hostdata->queued is 19, in_ptr: 6a
qlogifc0 : no handle slots, this should not happen
hostdata->queued is 19, in_ptr: 70
and so on.
After this machine locks up completetly and hard reboot must be done.
When there is no load on disks machine runs fine for many hours.
I'm using stripped logical volume on disk connected through this Qlogic FC
(from IBM's Shark) and using ext3.
LVM version 1.0.6
