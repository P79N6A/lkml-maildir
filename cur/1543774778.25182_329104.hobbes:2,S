Big problem. Timer interrupts can be firing while this is in progress.
The reason for profile_nop() is so that the code I have running during
timer interrupts (protected by local_irq_save()) runs to completion,
where it will afterward discover the flags or variables set to updated
states. You'll probably have to add more (e.g. memory barriers) since
you can tolerate less once you're dynamically allocating and freeing etc.

hotcpu_notifier() is there to avoid the #ifdef; you shouldn't need to
rearrange that.
Anyway, just keep fixing it up. There should be a few more after this.
