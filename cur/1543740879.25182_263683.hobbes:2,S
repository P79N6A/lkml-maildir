It's might be a bit expensive, but one could use a Xilinx Virtex 4
FPGA.  For example a XC4VFX60 has 16 SERDES (which could be used to
implement a 16X PCI Express link) and two embedded PowerPC 405 cores
(which can be used to run Linux -- there is already existing support
in the kernel for this).  The Virtex 4 can be clocked quite high (300
MHz wouldn't be out of the question), and interfaces like a wide DDR2
controller would be possible as well.
In fact the Virtex 4 has so many cool features it might be hard to
convert the code to an ASIC later....
