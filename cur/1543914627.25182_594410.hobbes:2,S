In general there are known formats available, the drawback is that every TV
application deals with it in a non-unified way at the moment, meaning alot
code duplication in userspace since there's no library available at the moment
which does the videoconversion from one to another format. Such a library is
beeing developed at the moment which gets plugged infront of accessing
the devicenodes.
Although in the long run I'm looking forward to reuse the userspace tuners with
such a library infront of everything by using i2c-dev.
This would also make it easy to reuse the sample code of several companies,
without having to cut out several features of the drivers and to rewrite them
to an inkernel format.
