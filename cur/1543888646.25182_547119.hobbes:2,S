I am not an expert on this, but I don't see how vc_cons[fg_console].d
would be uninitialized. It is always set in
drivers/char/vt.c:con_init() and drivers/char/vt.c:vc_allocate(). The
conswitchp change affects vc->vc_sw but I don't see that being used in
drivers/char/keyboard.c:kbd_keycode() except indirectly via
set_console et al.
Perhaps I am missing something here?
