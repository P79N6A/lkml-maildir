I'm not dumping 2.4. It will enter "maintenance-only" mode in 2.4.25. It
will be update as long as there are problems in it, but no more features
will creep in.
As for XFS, Christoph will review the patches and tell me what he thinks. 
Also other people mailed me saying they reviewed the code.
That makes me more comfortable with merging the XFS modifications.
