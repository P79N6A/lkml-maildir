Hi all people,
(RedHat 6.2)
Kindly advise the complete package files essential for configuration,
compilation and installation, etc. instead of by selecting "Everything"
during installation of RedHat 6.2.  Selecting "Utilities" does not work.
During installing new kernel following message was found;
**************************************************
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.14/scripts/lxdialog'
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DLOCALE  -DCURSES_LO
C="<curses.h>"   -c -o lxdialog.o lxdialog.c
In file included from lxdialog.c:22:
dialog.h:29: curses.h: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [lxdialog.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.14/scripts/lxdialog'
***************************************************
Kindly advise which missing file has to be installed from RPM source disc.
Thanks in advance.
Stephen
