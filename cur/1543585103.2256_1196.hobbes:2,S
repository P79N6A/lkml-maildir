Thanks! I'll try that out. How can I tell if the driver supports
CONFIG_NET_HW_FLOWCONTROL? I'm not sure, but I think the cards are
tulip-based, can I then use Robert & Jamal's optimised drivers?
It'll probably take some time before I can do further testing. (My employer
thinks I've spent too much time on it already...).
FYI, Linux had _much_ better delay variation characteristics than FreeBSD.
Typically no packet was delayed more than 100usec, whereas FreeBSD had some
packets delayed about 2-3 msec.
