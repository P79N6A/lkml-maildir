Eric,
i tried to load vmlinux with kexec and got
Ramdisks not supported with generic elf arguments
So i use mkelfImage with my patch ( convert elf64 to elf32) to make
another elf32. and loaded with kexec and can not get vga console too.
---serial console works well.
the mkelfImage 2.7 patch is at
http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache

So the problem is not bzImage related, but in somewhere in vmlinux.
