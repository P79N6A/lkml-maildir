if it isnt a software problem.
Its probably a problem releated to the cable or surrounding
interference on the cable.
a) loose connection either on back of machine or @ the hub / switch etc..
b) there is a large power supply sitting very close to the cable.
   i have seen the transformers on scanners / printers etc.. strong enough
   todo this is the cable gets wrapped around it
