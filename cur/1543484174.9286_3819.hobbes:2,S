  Hi, all. Version 90 of my devfs patch for the new RAID drivers is
now available from:
ftp://www.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.2/
My thanks to D. Lance Robinson <lancer@airways.com> for putting in the
time and effort to port devfs to a kernel with the new raid code.
This patch is against 2.2.0+Raid19990128.
				Regards,
					Richard....
