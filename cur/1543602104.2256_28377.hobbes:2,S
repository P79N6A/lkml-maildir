JFFS2 can't actually be built at the moment because the magic in 
fs/Makefile and fs/Config.in appears to be absent. The fix for that is
about number 20 in the patchbomb I'm currently preparing.
The terminally impatient can find the whole patch, before I finish removing 
some of the backward-compatibility crap, at
