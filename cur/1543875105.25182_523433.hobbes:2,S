+ * struct ubi_volume_info - UBI volume description data structure.
+ * @vol_id: volume ID
+ * @ubi_num: UBI device number this volume belongs to
+ * @size: how many physical eraseblocks are reserved for this volume
+ * @used_bytes: how many bytes of data this volume contains
+ * @used_ebs: how many physical eraseblocks of this volume actually contain any
+ * data
+ * @vol_type: volume type (%UBI_DYNAMIC_VOLUME or %UBI_STATIC_VOLUME)
+ * @corrupted: non-zero if the volume is corrupted (static volumes only)
+ * @upd_marker: non-zero if the volume has update marker set
+ * @alignment: volume alignment
+ * @usable_leb_size: how many bytes are available in logical eraseblocks of
+ * this volume
+ * @name_len: volume name length
+ * @name: volume name
+ * @cdev: UBI volume character device major and minor numbers
+ *
+ * The @corrupted flag is only relevant to static volumes and is always zero
+ * for dynamic ones. This is because UBI does not care about dynamic volume
+ * data protection and only cares about protecting static volume data.
+ *
+ * The @upd_marker flag is set if the volume update operation was interrupted.
+ * Before touching the volume data during the update operation, UBI first sets
+ * the update marker flag for this volume. If the volume update operation was
+ * further interrupted, the update marker indicates this. If the update marker
+ * is set, the contents of the volume is certainly damaged and a new volume
+ * update operation has to be started.
+ *
+ * To put it differently, @corrupted and @upd_marker fields have different
+ * semantics:
+ *     o the @corrupted flag means that this static volume is corrupted for some
+ *       reasons, but not because an interrupted volume update
+ *     o the @upd_marker field means that the volume is damaged because of an
+ *       interrupted update operation.
+ *
+ * I.e., the @corrupted flag is never set if the @upd_marker flag is set.
+ *
+ * The @used_bytes and @used_ebs fields are only really needed for static
+ * volumes and contain the number of bytes stored in this static volume and how
+ * many eraseblock this data occupies. In case of dynamic volumes, the
+ * @used_bytes field is equivalent to @size*@usable_leb_size, and the @used_ebs
+ * field is equivalent to @size.
+ *
+ * In general, logical eraseblock size is a property of the UBI device, not
+ * of the UBI volume. Indeed, the logical eraseblock size depends on the
+ * physical eraseblock size and on how much bytes UBI headers consume. But
+ * because of the volume alignment (@alignment), the usable size of logical
+ * eraseblocks if a volume may be less. The following equation is true:
+ * 	@usable_leb_size = LEB size - (LEB size mod @alignment),
+ * where LEB size is the logical eraseblock size defined by the UBI device.
+ *
+ * The alignment is multiple to the minimal flash input/output unit size or %1
+ * if all the available space is used.
+ *
+ * To put this differently, alignment may be considered is a way to change
+ * volume logical eraseblock sizes.
