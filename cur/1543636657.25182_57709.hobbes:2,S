Andrea,
Here is another approach. I added two version fields to the inode
structure. The first one is updated before i_size and the 2nd is
updated after with memory barriers in between.  The i_size_read()
samples the version fields and i_size and loops until it can read
i_size without an i_size update happening at the same time.  It is
not pretty but it does fix the problem and the cache line is not
written by i_size_read() and it should work on all architechtures.
I've tested this on a two proc system.
Let me know what you think,
Daniel
