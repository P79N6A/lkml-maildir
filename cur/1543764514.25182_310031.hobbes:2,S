Now, I'm sure my fears were reasonable. With RT-V0.7.44-02 SMP a can't
even reach an usable system state. This weird BUG: kstopmachine:xxxx RT
task yield()-ing! is flooding the init process to death.
Completely. Hard-reset is the only viable solution to a fast scrolling
console dump, which seems to be in a terrible, nasty and endless loop.
I'm not afraid anymore. RT-0.7.44-02 is useless on my P4 SMP/HT desktop
machine. ;)
Bye.
