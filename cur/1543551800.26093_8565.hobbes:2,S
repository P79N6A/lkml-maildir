Personally, I don't care what spelling is used, however I guess
the "correct" way though, is the way the license spells it
itself, which is:
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
------------------------------------------------------
I myself spell it this way also, so had I wrote the original, it
would have been correct.  ;o)  Unfortunately, this means I may
have missed a lot with my grep, so I'll go back and do another
patch.  If anyone has any other license inconsistencies,
copyright inconsistencies, etc.. please let me know ASAP, and
I'll grab them too.
