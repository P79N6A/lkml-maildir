Something like that. Interesting you point out select as wli was 
profiling/tracing the mozilla/acroread plugin combination that spins on wait 
and also found select was causing grief. It was calling select with a 15ms 
timeout and X was getting less than 5ms to do it's work and respond and it 
was repeatedly timing out. Seems a common link there.
