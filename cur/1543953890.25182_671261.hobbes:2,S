i'm not sure what this means -- which of the transformations in that
patch is considered unsafe?  here's a typical simplification:
-       tsk = current;
-       set_task_state(tsk, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
+       set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
  there's all sorts of usage of set_current_state() throughout the
tree.  how is simplifying the code in these two files in exactly the
same way any different?  or am i missing something because this
involves semaphores?

p.s.  given this bit from sched.h:
...
#define __set_task_state(tsk, state_value)              \
        do { (tsk)->state = (state_value); } while (0)
#define set_task_state(tsk, state_value)                \
        set_mb((tsk)->state, (state_value))
...
#define __set_current_state(state_value)                        \
        do { current->state = (state_value); } while (0)
#define set_current_state(state_value)          \
        set_mb(current->state, (state_value))
...
it's not clear why set_current_state() and __current_state() are
defined the way they are when it would seem to be simpler (and less
error-prone) to just write:
#define __set_current_state(sv)  __set_task_state(current, sv)
#define set_current_state(sv)   set_task_state(current, sv)
  the law of parsimony and all that.  or, once again, is there
something subtle i'm not seeing?
