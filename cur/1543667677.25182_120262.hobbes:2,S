The above test is comparing family, not model.  It's my understanding
that it's still a family 6 CPU, so it'll match '32'.

Nope. Nehemiah :-

Cache line size is still available from cpuid 80000006 though,
but as this is vendor and model specific, this could get messy
to decode. And then there's errata...
