Why not:

	write a library to talk to that filesystem
	have the library do emulation on other systems
in that order.

If you're going to have to do both the portable interface and the fs
support, does it really matter which order you do them in?
Again, this is curiosity, not sarcasm.  Here my reasons for wanting the
fs support first:
You don't always know exactly how the filesystem transactions will work.
~ You don't know until it's done whether you'll deviate from your design,
cut certain features, replace them with others...
And if you write the portable library first, and it ends up supporting
features a, b, and c, while the kernel supports features b, c, and d,
which obsoletes a, you have to add some features and remove some
features from the portable library to make it sane.
It'd be like writing OpenGL entirely in software, before hardware
accelerators work, and at the last minute have to change the library to
use triangles instead of splines.  What's more, every single app now has
to be rewritten or use the library's emulation -- that's assuming many
apps would consider using a 3D library that doesn't have hardware accel
support yet.
