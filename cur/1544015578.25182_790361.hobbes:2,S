I think hitting a version without the actual kernel source in it should 
actually make bisecting easier, not harder; you can say without even 
building the kernel that that version doesn't have the problem you're 
trying to find, because it doesn't have anything in it.
The alternative to having that part of the tree empty would be to stick in 
some kernel version there (probably 2.6.28), and then you'd build and test 
2.6.28 again, completely wasting a bunch of time.
Probably the bisect documentation or messages need to make it clear what 
you should do when you land on this sort of commit.
