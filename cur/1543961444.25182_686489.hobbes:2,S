Yes; that's something we're planning to do.

I'm basically using these patches to test the PCI passthrough functionality 
(by which we can assign host PCI devices to a guest OS via KVM). While other 
methods of handling DMA operations are being worked on (1-1 mapping of the 
guest in the host address space and virtualization-aware IOMMU translations), 
this patchset provides a quick way to check if things indeed work.
However, if some version of this patch can be useful upstream, I'll be glad to 
work on that. That said, as you point out, we need stackable dma ops as well 
as getting rid of the is_pv_device() function in dma_ops and that's something 
that can be done right away.
Thanks for the review!
