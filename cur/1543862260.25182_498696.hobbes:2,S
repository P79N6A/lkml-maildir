Hmm, would revokefs need to be explicitly stacked on top of the fs,
or could we just swap out fdt[fd] for the revokefs file, and have
the revokefs file's private data point to the original inode, with
it's write function returning an error, and read being passed through?
Do you (or hch) then have a problem with these functions (sitting either
in fs/revoke.c or fs/file_table.c) calling mprotect to remove the write
permission from the mmap'ed segment?  i.e. was the main objection to
mprotect being called from "just anywhere"?
