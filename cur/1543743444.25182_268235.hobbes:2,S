I'm not familar with the internals of sysfs. For example, on a 256 node
system, there will be 65536 instances of
	 /sys/devices/system/node/node<M>/distance<N>
Does this require any significant amount of kernel resources to
maintain this amount of information.

I like (3) the best.
I think it would also be useful to have a similar cpu-to-cpu distance
metric:
	% cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/distance
	10 20 40 60 
This gives the same information but is cpu-centric rather than
node centric.
