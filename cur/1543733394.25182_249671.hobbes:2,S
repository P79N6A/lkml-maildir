Right. But it is _another_ interface in the kernel, plus special userland
code supporting it.

Such as?

Haven't seen any that made sense to me, sorry.

Maybe. Question is, is it worth it (kernel modifications + userland
support, or just userland support, or leave it alone). Sure, it might make
your particular application easier to write (at a cost for _all_ filesystem
hackers!), perhaps even a bit faster; but is _your_ particular convenience
worth the cost for _everybody_?

bk, cvs, svn, rcs, ... are working just fine here, thank you so much. Used
to work on SunOS and Solaris, even SCO Unix (I used at least rcs and cvs
there). No Reiser4 in sight.

Again, _what_ version control exactly? Will the above packages be able to
make use of it (remember they all are cross-platform (at least cross-Unix),
and so quite unlikely to make use of a Reiser4 on Linux whackiness...)?

Right. It offers what applications need to build their own stuff. It is
minimalistic (well, sort of) and  time-proven.
