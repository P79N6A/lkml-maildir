Subject: Via-rhine in 2.4.5 still requires cold-boot

Just for the record, the via-rhine.c in 2.4.5 still does not work if you
soft-boot the computer (at least one a machine here), MAC address shows up
as 00:00:00:00:00:00 and it fails - but a cold boot (power cable off, no
standby power) makes it work.
I read something that we'd need to reload the EEPROM on the boards or
something if a cold-boot solves a problem. Well it does. :)
