Welcome to three months ago.
Here in the future, this was deemed a non-issue.
However this does highlight another problem.
End-users who take linux for use in embedded systems (especially)
tend to live in their own little world rarely contributing anything
back to upstream, popping up occasionally when months after decisions
have been made on things.   Remind me again why we should care about
your out of tree binary only modules ?

Were they part of the kernel tree, people might care enough to
a) fix them so that they work and b) care enough that they _keep working_
even if people changing APIs etc don't have the necessary hardware.
This isn't the 1990s any more, we shouldn't need to explain how all this works.

The question is "do you care about giving back" or are you intending
to leech of Linux and just complain when it changes in ways that
don't mesh with your plans?
