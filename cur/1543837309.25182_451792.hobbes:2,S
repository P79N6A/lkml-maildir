metoo, but currently quite a lot of Core Duo-based notebooks with 1 GB of RAM
and more are still being sold, let alone the Celerons, Semprons etc.
The patch is designed so that the higmem-related parts are just dropped by the
compiler if CONFIG_HIGHMEM is not set.  That makes it a bit larger, but then
they don't get in the way when they are not needed.
[Well, I've been using 64-bit machines only for quite some time anyway, but
I thought it would be nice to do something for the others, too. ;-) ]
