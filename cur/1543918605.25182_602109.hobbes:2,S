I don't want to jump the gun on the analysis but it just might
be the packet sharing fixes Herbert put in a short time ago.
What you could do is go back to say rc2 and see if you still get
the panics, then bisect from there to narrow it down.
If rc2 still gives the panic, it's something else, perhaps device
specific.
