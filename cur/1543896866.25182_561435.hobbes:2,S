I'm going to need exactly the same hook fro Calgary, as well Intel for
VT-d, and AMD for their upcoming IOMMU, etc. How about we do
struct iommu_ops {
  struct dma_ops {
    ...
  }
  void (*shutdown)(void);
}
And then pci_iommu_shutdown() becomes
if (iommu_ops->shutdown)
  iommu_ops->shutdown();
?
Cheers,
Muli
