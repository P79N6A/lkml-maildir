Subject: large offset llseek breaks for device special files on ac series

Hi,
the ac series include a check in default_llseek() to not set the
file position beyond the file systems maximum file size.
This check should be done only for regular files, e.g. for
a device special file the test does not make sense.
Either we change the check or we have to write a llseek
method for each device driver.
The patch below by-passes the check for non-file inodes.
The patch is against 2.4.5.ac16. The problem was introduced
earlier (at least on 2.4.3.ac14 the same check is there).
