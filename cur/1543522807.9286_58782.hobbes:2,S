Very true. 
However, I'd recommend forcing the reboot by pressing the reset switch
instead of shutting down normally. Automatically forces the fsck. 
But more importantly, you run the chance that the wrong block, somehow
marked dirty isn't written back to the drive....
(This only applies if you notice the messages and know what to do
within 5-30 seconds....)
