Yes, I remember. However, if I saw a BK changeset called "Security fixes"
or "Security fixes -- details censored in accordance with the US DMCA"
then it would obviously be a security patch worth looking at. So looking
at linux.bkbits.net would still be an improvement over looking at a raw
patch with everything combined (which is what was the complaint was
about).
