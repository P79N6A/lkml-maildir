Ok, I think your picture cut off the last hex digits on the right, but 
what I can make out of the disassembly, I have to admit that it looks 
very much like it might be exactly the same thing Ingo was seeing.
The disassembly is a bit scrambled, but the particular instruction that 
oopses for you is
	mov    0x10(%ebx),%eax
and the instructions around it do seem to bear some similarity to the 
whole "sg_next()" thing, ie I see a 
	test   $0x1,%al
and a
	lea    0x10(%ebx),%eax
around there too.
If you cut down the number of entries printed for the call trace (which 
involves editing the source code, no nice config options, I'm afraid), you 
could get the rest of it..
