The meaning of the default behavior then depends upon where in the tree it
reinserts it.

Then it should probably just not support 'sched_yield' and return ENOSYS.
Applications should work around an ENOSYS reply (since some versions of
Solaris return this, among other reasons). Perhaps for compatability, it
could also yield 'lightly' just in case applications ignore the return
value.
It could also handle it the way it handles the smallest sleep time that it
supports. This is sub-optimal if no other task are ready-to-run at the same
static priority level and that might be an expensive check.
If CFS really can't support sched_yield's semantics, then it should just
not, and that's that. Return ENOSYS and admit that the behavior sched_yield
is documented to have simply can't be supported by the scheduler.

We put it exactly where we would have when its timeslice ran out. If we can
reward it a little bit, that's great. But if not, we can live with that.
Just imagine that the timer interrupt fired to indicate the end of the
thread's run time when the thread called 'sched_yield'.

Then what does he do when the task runs out of run time? It's hard to
imagine we can't do that when the task calls sched_yield.

I agree.

That is not true. The task is waiting for something that will be done by
another thread that is ready-to-run and at the same priority level. The task
does not need to wait until the thing is guaranteed done but wishes to wait
until it is more likely to be done. This is an often-misused but sometimes
sensible thing to do.
I think the API gets blamed for two things that are not its fault:
1) It's often misunderstood and misused.
2) It was often chosen as a "best available" solution because no truly good
solutions were available.

Sure, if there is more information. But if all you really want to do is wait
until other threads at the same static priority level have had a chance to
run, then sched_yield is the right API.
