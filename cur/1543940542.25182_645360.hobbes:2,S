There is no copyright violation: ndiswrapper is licensed under GPLv2. And the
Windows driver is not linked to kernel code - only ndiswrapper functions are
linked to kernel.
In case that is not clear, ndiswsrapper is an implementation of NDIS and some
Windows kernel API functions in Linux kernel. The Windows driver is linked to
these functions so the driver works as if it is working under Windows.
