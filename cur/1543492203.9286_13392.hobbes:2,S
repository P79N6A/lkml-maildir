I hope you only send the bounce message to the _envelope_ sender address,
though. Otherwise you'll make yourself a PITA on mailing lists :) (as you
bounce messages sent to the list, not to you...)
Envelope based filtering won't work on mailing lists, anyway. The amount of
spam on linux-kernel -- that gets through, that is, I don't know how much Matti
et al. filter -- is very low for the volume. The trick of filtering out anything
which doesn't contain the list address in the To: or Cc: lines should deal with
the rest.
