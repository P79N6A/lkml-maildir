What about this instead
struct iodesc {
	struct iovec *iov;
	unsigned long nr_segs;
	unsigned long seg_limit;
	size_t nr_bytes;
};
That will enable resizeable iodescs with partial completion state and
will enable successive filling of an iodesc with iovs.
This will be needed anyway. I built an complete short userspace 
module for that already. I can post and GPLv2 it somewhere, if people
are interested.
