If it is window clamping, then you should be asymptotically approaching 
a ratio between receive buffer and window that corresponds (with a 
fudge factor) to the ratio between TCP segment data size and allocated 
packet size.  If you make the receive buffer large enough, then the 
clamped window should still end up big enough.  Also, since you have 
"real time" data, a larger receive buffer should probably be adequate 
to eliminate this problem, since it only occurs when the receiving 
application falls behind for a while, and a bigger receive buffer 
allows it to fall behind more without triggering the window clamping.
