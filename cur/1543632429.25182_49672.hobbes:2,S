Hi,
since version 2.5.19 my YMF744 gets detected as a YMF724
the sound does work, but I think there's something weird going on
2.5.18 and earlier work and disabling acpi and/or preempt doesn't solve it
Maybe it's because the YMF shares it's interrupt with the usb controller, but that wasn't a problem in past

        case 0x0010: str = "YMF744"; break;                                     
        case 0x0012: str = "YMF754"; break;                                     
        default: str = "???"; break;                                            
        }
this code hasn't changed, so I think id->device isn't set the right way (maybe it's the id->device from the usb controller?!)
a few lines later there's a check if (id->device >= 0x0010) where the device (if it's a 744 or higher) gets initialised a bit different from the other chips
