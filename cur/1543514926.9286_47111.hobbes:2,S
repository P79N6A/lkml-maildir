	one of the machines i tested my patch/kernel on was a PowerBase200
(603ev also, infact its bascially a 6400), and i have not had any problems
with HFS in 2.3.23 with this fix.  i've done many reads and writes, i
haven't had much time to use .24 but i will be fixing up .25 tonite
hopefully and i'll post another patch since there wasn't enuff time for
these fixes to get into .25 and i'll post the tomorrow hopefully with a
.config

	this is something which really needs to be investigated, why its
happening to you but not to me and we have almost identical machines...
