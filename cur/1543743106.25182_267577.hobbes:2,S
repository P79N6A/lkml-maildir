There's something I've been wondering about for a while.  There is a lot of code 
in linux that looks something like this:
err = -ERRORCODE
if (error condition)
	goto out;
While nice to read, it would seem that it might be more efficient to do the 
following:
if (error condition) {
	err = -ERRORCODE;
	goto out;
}
Is there any particular reason why the former is preferred?  Is the compiler 
smart enough to optimize away the additional write in the non-error path?
