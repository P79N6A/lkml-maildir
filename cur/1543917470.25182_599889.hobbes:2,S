Well, so far it's working:  about ten poweroffs since I patched it,
and no issues with any of them.  Prior to that, it seemed like about
one in five poweroffs wouldn't (power off).
It'll take a lot more testing to confirm, though.
What can I call to determine if more than one CPU is enabled, anyway?
Here's the hack I'm using here, very situation (2 cores) specific,
and it still has some printk's leftover with a sleep so I have time
to read them before the lights go out.  :)
