Ok, good. Then I submit for general review (not Linus yet) the final
patch:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/kmod-2.3.40-p1.patch
It is 35K, 44 files changed, 109 insertions, 273 deletions. I thought
Linus likes the idea of removing lines of code so I made sure I remove
as much as possible :)
