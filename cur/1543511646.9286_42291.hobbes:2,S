Definitely vague.  A pet peeve:  Mice are allocated all over the place: 
serial mice, bus mice, USB mice.  Having a standard device node and API
for mice would be handy, ie. open /dev/mouse0 and always get the mouse. 
(though, doing so would entail having a parport-like driver subsystem
for serial)

It still surprises me that devfs has not made it into the kernel, as an
OPTIONAL module which is DISABLED by default.

Caveat:  I haven't looked at the latest 'input patch', maybe it already
does this.
