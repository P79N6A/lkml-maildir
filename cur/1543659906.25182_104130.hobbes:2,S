	I believe I'm experiencing the same problem that Mikael Pettersson
reported, although the symptom is normally a hang with SMP, because
the bad pointer dereference in __find_symbol results in the fault
hanndler calling search_exception_tables, which calls search_module_extable,
which tries to grab the modlist_lock spinlock, but that lock was
already taken by resolve_symbol (which called __find_symbol in the first
place).
	Somone else on irc reported a similar problem when I asked.
	Thanks Mikael, for posting the kernel oops listing.  You
probably just saved me about 45 minutes of switching over to a
non-SMP kernel to check for that oops.
