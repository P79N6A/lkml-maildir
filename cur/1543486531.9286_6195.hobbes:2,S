But being able to define processor  sets is useful none the less especially
for  large  systems.  That's  why  HP/Convex,  IBM,  SGI  and  others  have
implemented it in their MPP systems.
Think of the following scenario: you have a 16 CPU system with  let's say 4
GiB of RAM (no  longer utopic  with Linux!).  You want  to give  people the
possibility to compile and test on the system without restrictions, but for
those with working applications  you want to give them the  most out of the
system.
Typically you would do something like the following:
System complex: CPU 0 to CPU 1     512 MeB RAM  interactive users
Small Complex:  CPU 2 to CPU 3     512 MeB RAM  batch users
Medium Complex: CPU 4 to CPU 7     1 GiB RAM    batch users
Large Complex:  CPU 8 to CPU 15    2 GiB RAM    batch users
Even on small systems (2 or 4 CPU Intel boxes) it might be desirable:
Think of  a departmental server where  batch jobs need to  be developed and
later run for production purposes. In that case you would want to reserve 1
or more  processors for the  production batches,  something you can  not do
with a simple batch system (even if you use such monsters like NQS or DQS).
Yours,
