The underlying problem is that an svm instruction has been executed, but 
svm is disabled.  Since kvm enables svm unconditionally on all 
processors on startup, there are only a few paths that can potentially 
trigger this:
- another virtualization module turned svm off
- cpu hotadd/hotremove (suspend/resume triggers this)
- something did a read-modify-write cycle on cr4 (which contains the svm 
enable bit) while kvm enabled that bit
- core was turned off (does linux power management do that?)
Anything ring a bell?
