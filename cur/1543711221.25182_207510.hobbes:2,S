Remember the CPU with the f00f bug? How about the FP unit bug?
With ucode updates, those bugs can be fixed with zero overhead,
just an additional second or two of boot-time.

Of course, some don't have WCS (Writable control-store) and
therefore can't be updated.

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.".... But there are some people
who want the "latest and greatest" even though there is no performance
change at all.
When new CPUs hit the market there are some "immature features", i.e.,
BUGS. With a WCS, micro-code work-arounds can be provided so that
the CPU doesn't have to be thrown away. If you use the wrong micro-
code, perhaps the "latest and greatest", you may actually break
the CPU because the work-arounds go away.
Review the stuff on 
http://www.x86.org
. Even though it's slanted
far to the left, there is some good information there.
Cheers,
