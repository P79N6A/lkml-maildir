this is one of those things that is still hurting Linux's credibility in the
read world.  people see this kind of obviously broken behavior, and install 
*BSD or Solaris instead.
isn't this clearly a case of the kernel being too smart: making it impossible
for a clueful admin to do what he needs?  multi-nic machines are now quite
common, but this "feature" makes them far less useful, since the stack is 
violating the admin's intention.

there's NOTHING weird about a machine having two nics and two IPs,
wanting to behave like two hosts.
is there any positive/beneficial reason for the current behavior?
