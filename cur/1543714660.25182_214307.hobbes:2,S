I've given it a short spin and here's a bunch of comments:
 - the split into three source files is supserflous, one file should do it
 - please don't use host.h or scsi.h from drivers/scsi/.  The defintions
   not present in include/scsi/ are deprecated and shall not be used (the
   most prominent example in your driver are the Scsi_<Foo> typedefs that
   have been replaced by struct scsi_foo
 - the driver doesn't even try to deal with multiple HBAs
 - your detection logic could be streamlined a little, e.g. the request/release
   resource mess
