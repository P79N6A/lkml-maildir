With gcc 4.0.1:
    text           data     bss     dec             hex filename
25675334        5851630 1819976 33346940        1fcd57c vmlinux-my-patch
25675366        5851630 1819976 33346972        1fcd59c vmlinux-your-patch
INT_MAX -> ULONG_MAX is correct, even though it doesn't seem to make a 
difference with today's gcc.
Trying to change the code in a way that gcc will produce better code 
doesn't seem to be worth it (except in extreme hot paths).
