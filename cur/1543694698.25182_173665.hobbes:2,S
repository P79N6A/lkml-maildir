The chip on the SATA controller is the same as the PATA version.  The
SATA interface is handled by external bridge chips.  I don't really
see how it would make any difference if the hpt374 is on a PCI board
on on the motherboard.  The Alpha system is quite different from your
average PC in some ways, though.  That could explain some differences.
