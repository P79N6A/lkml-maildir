I have a really strange problem. I need to change the mtu size of my
interfaces. Unfortunately, I have not been able to track down the
problem. Here's output of this.
[root@amlai2 amlai]# /sbin/ifconfig eth0 mtu 1200
SIOCSIFMTU: Invalid argument
Anyone have any ideas as to why this might be happening? What kernel
options might prevent one from changing the mtu size? Any help with
this would be greatly appreciate. Thanks in advance.
