   The patch inlined below gets 2.4.20-pre4 to compile (and boot) on my
   testmachine again. Trivial stuff mostly, dunno about the page_to_phys
   macro, though -- DaveM, could you have a look at it?
I told you I applied this to my tree already.  Why are you resending
it?
I didn't get to merge my sparc stuff to Marcelo until late this
afternoon (PST time).
