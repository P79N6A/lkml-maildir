Hello,
I have successfuly compiled kernel 2.4.19, but when I reboot my PC, kernel
is loaded in mem and when it should be uncompressed, my PC is automaticaly
rebooted. I really don't know why, till now I had no problems with
hardware. When I tried to do the same on my second linux system on the
same PC, the result was the same.
What coulf be wrong? 
Thanks for advice,
	Martin Juracek
