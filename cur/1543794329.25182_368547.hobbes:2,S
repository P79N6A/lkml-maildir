That's very possible, but it also could be that the cards
that fail only on Sparc have Sun forth firmware on them,
which would thus only load firmware on Sparc boxes.
I still think the endianness theory is more likely, however.
Perhaps the I2O datastructures should be endian annotated
and then pushed through sparse. :-)
