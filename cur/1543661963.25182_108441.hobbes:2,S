definitely, but again the most important by far is to submit big
commands, if you get the 512k commands interleaved by different task
it isn't a panic situation.

If you decrease readahead with anticipatory scheduler you will submit
the small commands, if you decrease the readahead you can stall 10
minutes any write in the queue, and still you won't grow the command in
the head of the queue.

yes, and anticipatory scheduler isn't going to fix it. furthmore with
IDE the max merging is 64k so you can see little of the whole picture.
