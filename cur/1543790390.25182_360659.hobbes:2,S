Hmm. This is happening because I have both qlogicfc and qla2200 as
modules ?

Not intentionally. I have qla2200, qla2300 cards in my machine.
I build all the qlogic drivers as modules.
I hate to admit it - but I do use modules for qlogic disks.
I can't seem to compile the qlogic drivers (2200, 2300) into the
kernel and boot without problems (consistently on all my machines 
- I run into few issues):
(1) Between kernels, sometimes probing order changes and my local
disks get probed last and screws up my boot process - I don't
think this is a qlogic problem.
(2) Sometimes, one of the driver complains something like 
"PCI region already in use" and hangs on boot.
BTW, (2) happens even if its modules and I can't boot my
machine. Sometimes I had to boot with old kernel and hide
the modules - so boot process can't find them to workaround
the problem.
Is there a "dont-load-modules" option or don't load a specific
module option on boot ?
Thanks,
Badari
