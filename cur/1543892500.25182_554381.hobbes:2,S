The kernel's internal event API doesn't track any of this stuff and
it's not clear we'd want it to. It'd be a bit simpler perhaps to
simply allow SIGSTOPing events/0. This might even work today from
userspace.
In general, it's considered a mistake to mark CPU hogs as RT precisely
because they present a starvation risk to everything else in the
system, not just kernel threads. We could add kernel infrastructure to
make events survive this sort of thing, but that will very likely just
expose another kernel or userspace livelock.
