Look in your mainboard manual
I think you'll find that the PCI/AGP slots you are using for these devices
share IRQs because they are physically linked together.
I don't know about the AOPEN board, but on an ASUS P3B-F for example, the
AGP slot and PCI1 share their IRQ, and PCI slots 3&6 and 4&5 also share
so if you put devices in all of these slots, some devices will share
interrupts.
The only workaround is to pick different slots, and/or to not have more
than 4 devices in your system that don't like to share interrupts with
anything else.
