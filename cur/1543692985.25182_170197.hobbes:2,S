XenoServers is more about global-scale distributed computing
rather than clusters.
However, there's no reason why you can't apply the OpenMosix
patches to a xen -patched linux, and hence emulate a cluster on a
multi-processor machine. This isn't as daft as it sounds, as if
you have a highly parallel ccNUMA machine you might actually be
better off in terms of performance by carving it up into a set of
smaller multi processor virtual machines that you then glue back
together with something like OpenMosix.
However, although Xen is itself SMP capable, it currently doesn't
support SMP guests, though we're actively working on it.
Best,
Ian
