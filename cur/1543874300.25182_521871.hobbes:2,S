No.
First, you don't need to use unlock_task_sighand(), you can just use
spin_unlock_irqrestore(sighand) directly. But this is, I agree, not good.
If signalfd_get_sighand()->lock_task_sighand() succeeds, it is safe to
dereference ctx->tsk. The task can't be freed and ctx->tsk can't be cleared
while we are holding siglock.
However, I was wrong, we still need a re-check after lock_task_sighand().
We should check ctx->tsk != NULL.
Oleg.
