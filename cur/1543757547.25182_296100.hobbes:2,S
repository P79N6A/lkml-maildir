Ok, I found it. It's a bug that was there forever it seems, where
radeonfb accel ops may corrupt kernel memory (via bus master from the
radeon chip) when switching back from X, due to X remapping some areas
of the card vs. fbcon calling some radeonfb accel ops before radeonfb
has a chance to re-initialize the chip (when switching back from X).
I'm cooking a workaround patch for 2.6.11, will be ready as soon as I
have tested. Proper fix is to make sure fbcon never calls any fbdev
accel op before the chip has been properly restored (by a set_var call),
but that is beyond the scope of 2.6.11 I suppose...
Ben.
