The PCI interface in 2.3 is quite well designed and covers a superset of
the features in Donald's pci-netif interface.  Further, it receives/has
received much wider testing.

It does not mean that at all.  Look at current acenic or rrunner
drivers for example.  It is ENTIRELY possible to create a 2.3 driver
which is fully backwards compatible with 2.0 and 2.2.
Donald chooses to create a 2.0 driver which happens to work in 2.2/2.3.

Much better kernel infrastructure.
