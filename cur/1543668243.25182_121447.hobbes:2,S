I'm not using ACPI but APM and, on a vanilla 2.4.20 kernel, that's what
I'm seeing with my 3CCFE575CT on my kernel dmesg ring:
<snip>
Yenta IRQ list 08d8, PCI irq5
Socket status: 30000020
Yenta IRQ list 08d8, PCI irq10
Socket status: 30000006
cs: cb_alloc(bus 6): vendor 0x10b7, device 0x5257
PCI: Failed to allocate resource 0(1000-2c3) for 06:00.0
PCI: Enabling device 06:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
<snip>
eth0: command 0x5800 did not complete! Status=0xffff
eth0: command 0x2804 did not complete! Status=0xffff
<snip>
However, Alan Cox patches for 2.4.20 and Red Hat's linux kernel both
seem to work OK... I think it's related to PCI resource assignment.
