Ok I'll do

I'd rather not overdo my patch. Better leave some KERN_WARNINGs where they 
are now than hide something important. I am concentrated on killing
_obviously_ informative msgs.

I modified printks which were hard to find due to lack of
any greppable [ :-) ] string. Next poor soul will be more lucky :-)
I don't think adding log levels massively is good: I'd like to see
real world bogus warning log files and fix only those ('don't overdo it' 
policy)
