It's a little hard to do that. It's basically the situation you have
below, there is no way to know what "waiter" is at compile time, so you
can't really do the TYPE_EQUAL() trick on "get_next_waiter" .
I have "waiter->waiter_changed_prio()" which results in the same
problem. There is no way to know what "type" waiter is at compile
time ..

This is essentially what I have now, but it's also what I'm unhappy
with. The only reason that I don't like this method is that it's a
little slow .. I don't mind keeping it as long as no better way presents
itself.
