Subject: [BUG] NFS in 2.4.20-pre6+ stalls

  Hi, all. Just noticed this with 2.4.20-pre6 (and -pre7): NFS write
sometimes (usually) stalls for minutes at a time. This problem wasn't
there on 2.4.19. I've noticed this when writing a files around 1 MiB
or so (some a bit larger, some a bit smaller). It makes NFS almost
unusable. I've appended the kernel logs which come, at no extra
charge, with the problem. On the server, I see partial files (integral
number of wsize= blocks) during the stall. Eventually, the client
seems to recover and the rest of the file is written. The writing
application is in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state.
				Regards,
