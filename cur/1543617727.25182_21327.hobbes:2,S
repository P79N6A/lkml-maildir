Well what is the different requirements for desktop use versus, the server in 
terms of virtual memory? What I am doing on my system with MP3's playing, 
running Xfree86 on a SuSE 7.3 system will be different from a server running 
DMBS's.
Another issue, would it be possible to select one or the other VM's like you 
do for example the CPU type? 
Kind regards,
Mayy
