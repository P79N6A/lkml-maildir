It seems that of all the popular mail clients only Thunderbird has this
problem.  AFAICT it's impossible to make it DTRT with inline patches and
even if it is the fact that most users get it wrong points to a serious
usability/UI issue.
Would a patch to add "Don't use Thunderbird/Mozilla Mail" to
SubmittingPatches be accepted?  Then we can point the Mozilla developers
at it (they have shown zero interest in fixing the problem so far) and
hopefully this will light a fire under someone.
