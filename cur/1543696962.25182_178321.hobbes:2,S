I strongly agree.
There are two huge reasons I develop and debug drivers solely in 2.6 
now: kksymoops and irqdebug.  Both have helped a great deal in tracking 
down problems.  Indeed, screaming irqs that lead to lockups are 
instantly detected in 2.6.
But hey... I'm just a developer.  Who can say whether it should be on by 
default?
