Two notes I wanted to get out before the rewrite:
1) The preferred format is likely to be a -single- diffstat followed by
a changeset, and
2) "bk changes -L <local-linus-repository>" is the preferred way to get
a listing of changesets not yet sent to Linus, not "bk push -nl"
A script should be appearing in the very near future, which generates
the desired for-Linus changeset format automatically.  In the medium
term future and beyond, BK itself will hopefully generate the text.
