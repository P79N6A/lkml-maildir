Just out of curiosity,
the NetGear uses a modified tulip.c, which was supplied by NetGear.  I
was just wondering what keeps us from including that tulip.c in the
kernel as a driver for NetGear cards.  Maybe as netgear.c?  I was (just
a tad) confused (for a coupla seconds) when choosing the driver for my
card, since it the settings changed a little (two different DEC card
options, now).  I mean, the code is basically Don's work; it still has
his name in it and everything.  Is there some overriding reason why it
(NG's tulip.c) can't be included as a separate driver?
