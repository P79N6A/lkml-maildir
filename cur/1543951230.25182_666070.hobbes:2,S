Very sorry,

It's not needed immediately. Please apply it to -mm.

No, it isn't needed in 2.6.25. Sorry, I shouldn't have used 'fixes'.
IOMMUs allocate memory areas without considering a low level driver's
segment boundary limits. Thus low level drivers have a workaround to
adjust scatter lists that IOMMUs build. Duplicating such workaround in
many LLDs and adjusting scatter lists in LLDs again are not good
(because they easily lead to bugs especially after sg chain
introduction and not efficient, etc).
I've been modifying some of the IOMMUs to make them respect low level
drivers' limits.

I expected that someone in IA64 list might konw the answer. I put
BUG_ON so we will know the answer eventually even if nobody knows it.

Sorry, I don't have IA64. So it's not tested. I read the code and I
learned that IA64's IOMMU ignores segment boundary limits.
I want the patch to be tested in -mm kernels and hope that it will be
merged into 2.6.26.

How about the following description?
IA64's IOMMU implementation allocates memory areas spanning LLD's
segment boundary limit. It forces low level drivers to have a
workaround to adjust scatter lists that the IOMMU builds.
We are in the process of making all the IOMMUs respect the segment
boundary limits to remove such work around in LLDs. This patch is for
IA64's IOMMU.
Thanks,
