Subject: [PATCH] (test11-ac4)  unbelievably silly (fatal) typo in raid5.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Alan,
 raid5 rebuild has been fatally flawed ever since it got into 2.4, and
 my recent testing has been looking at speed more than correctness, so
 I didn't notice until now.
 raid5_sync_request is handed a block number in 1K units and needs to 
 convert to 512byte sector units.
 I could have used   (block_nr*2)
 I could have used   (block_nr<<1)
 but instead I used  (block_nr<<2)  !!!!  :-(
Please apply the following patch.
Thanks, 
NeilBrown
