I mean exactly rmmod capi; modprobe capi. The problem is, that on unload
time, the capi_major has been set to major_ret, which is 0 if a major
number is given. Of course it does not unregister 68 then. Consequently
when trying to load it a second time after unloading it fails, because it
has not freed the major 68.
