Maybe setting up a mailing list where all the patches have to be posted 
before inclusion in this tree, would help the maintainer(s) a lot.
Since we expect little traffic (at least compared to LKML) a lot of 
developers (even "small" developers like myself) can review all the 
patches for correctness, and throw quite a few eyes on them. The more 
eyes, the less a chance for bugs to slip by.
Just a thought,
