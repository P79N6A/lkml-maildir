Thanks for pointing this out.  There's a lot of self-rolled stuff in the 
vendor driver, and we haven't removed it all yet.  That one should be 
easy though.

I agree.  There's a lot of cosmetic work left to do on this driver, but 
we felt it was time to get more eyes on it.

Yeah, we'll inline these as well.  Would you say that level of cosmetic 
cleanliness is required for merging, or should we focus solely on the 
functional issues for now?
