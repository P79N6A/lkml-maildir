I wouldn't consider it a minor API change, but theoretically they should
perform identically. Since some changes were non trivial, I wouldn't
guarantee that they behave identically :)
However, I'm not sure that's all that interesting. The code is a
straight enough port over that if there are bugs, they'll be there in
both versions, except for some trivial porting mistakes. Those are easy
to find and easy to fix normally.
The other kinds of bugs, like fundamental design flaws or bugs that
have always been there, are more interesting and likely to be in both.
IMO, I think testing with usb-uhci.c and uhci.c is still useful, but
testing with the -hcd variants is the most ideal since that will be the
final code base.
