Yes. arch/x86_64/kernel/mce.c is calling sysdev_register and sysdev_unregister
for cpu hot_add and hot_remove respectively.
The problem is that due to the perf optimization, refcnt remains at 1
even after unregister (as it never gets decremented to 0 in kref_put()).
So, when we try to register next time for same sysdev (The object is percpu,
so previously set refcnt will remain 1), init sees that refcnt is already 1
and print out the WARNing.

In that case, I think we should change the WARN_ON in question to check for > 1.
