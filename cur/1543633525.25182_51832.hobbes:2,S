regardless of kernel (2.4.pre19 or 2.5.21). maybe my devfsd.conf is wrong, but 
various tweaks did not help --- i have found nowhere on the net how exactly 
configure it for v4l devices. 
kernel just says "Linux video capture interface v.1.00", accepts pwc module 
ok, usb devices get registered, but still no video0 device.
no fb devices visible too.
