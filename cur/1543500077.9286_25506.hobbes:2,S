When i try and use my scsi cd writer for the first time after a reboot/power
on i get this:
bigbird:/usr/local/src# mount /dev/scd0 /mnt
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 27, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 0x28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 27) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 0
/dev/scd0: I/O error
mount: block device /dev/scd0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
but after that it works fine until i have to reboot.
CD Writer is a Traxdata CDR4120 (Teac innards)
SCSI card is a PCI Adaptec 2920 with an AIC7xxx chipset
/* From the kernel bootup stuff */
(scsi0) <Adaptec AIC-7850 SCSI host adapter> found at PCI 11/0
(scsi0) Narrow Channel, SCSI ID=7, 3/255 SCBs
(scsi0) Downloading sequencer code... 412 instructions downloaded
scsi0 : Adaptec AHA274x/284x/294x (EISA/VLB/PCI-Fast SCSI) 5.1.10/3.2.4
       <Adaptec AIC-7850 SCSI host adapter>
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: Traxdata  Model: CDR4120           Rev: 5.0J
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
(scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 10.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 15.
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 0x/0x caddy
(what's the last line? This drive has a tray... and is definitely faster than
0x!)
This has only happened with the 2.2.x kernels, when i had Slackware 3.6 on
it was all fine and happy, it started happening when i installed Slackware 4.0
which comes with kernel 2.2.7.
Any ideas why this is happening? More info about my system available if you
need it.
