Hope I am not biting my ass now, but I believed this was suggested but 
the counter-argument were; is really a file/system made to configure the 
kernel related to the maintainer?
I like the idea of ".maintainers" (or maybe even ".maintainer" now). It 
has also been suggested that the file should be at the lowest common 
pathway to avoid duplication. Downside is the added need to search for 
the file...
