I've just realized that some people may not know why the above uhci bug
is a problem.
Having done some measurements and calculations, the above uhci bug
translates into a shortened battery life: 20 minutes less for the laptop
I've been testing on. You get 1h30 instead of 1h50 you would normally
get if uhci would work correctly.
That's like having only 84% of your battery available to start with.
