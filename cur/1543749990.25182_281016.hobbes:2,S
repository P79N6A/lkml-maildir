Since you provided no debugging output I had to provide you the full
reccomandation. There was no sign that you didn't run out of lowmemory,
I don't know what else is running on the box with the cp.

Did you apply Con's disable-swap-token leaving the sysctl to the default
value after applying that patch?
Of course I know if you don't apply Con's fix it will run oom, you don't
need a cp for that.
