Subject: [RFC: 2.6.22 patch] don't offer DISPLAY_SUPPORT for now
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

DISPLAY_SUPPORT offers support code without any users currently in the 
tree. For a user it's quite confusing that the help text talks about
"proper drivers" when none are available.
This patch therefore lets DISPLAY_SUPPORT depend on BROKEN until there 
will be user.

 	  This framework adds support for low-level control of a display.
 	  This includes support for power.
 
 	  Enable this to be able to choose the drivers for controlling the
 	  physical display panel/monitor on some platforms. This not only
 	  covers LCD displays for PDAs but also other types of displays
 	  such as CRT, TVout etc.
 
 	  To have support for your specific display panel you will have to
 	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.
