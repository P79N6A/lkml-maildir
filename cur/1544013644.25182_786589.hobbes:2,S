It's been this way for about a decade....  that being said, if you
really want to do this, you can today via "mount -o ro,noload /dev/XXX
/mntpt".  However, the system could crash or fail because the
filesystem without having run the journal could be quite inconsistent.

It's not *that* hard; if someone would like to cons up a patch, please
feel free....  but it's certainly not a high priority for me or most
of the other ext3 filesystem developers.
