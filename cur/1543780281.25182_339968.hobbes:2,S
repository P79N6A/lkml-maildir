After retesting with 2.6.13-rc6 quite some of the problems are gone.
There are, however, still problems:
1. It is necessary to do the following or suspend will hang:
   cardctl eject
   killproc cardmgr
   remove all pcmcia modules
   In 2.6.11 it was sufficient to call 'cardctl eject'. I'll create a
   bug report.
2. The attached script can produce all sorts of pcmcia related
   problems if it is modified where stated - the attached version
   seems to work without problems if not modified. Do you want
   a bug report filed for this, too?
