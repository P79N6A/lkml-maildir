Thanks for the idea!
I did thinking of it allready, but dropped, because:
I can only use swap _file_ in this config, and swapping into file is
relatively slow.
I am affraid, it will be slow down this system for some cases.
The system (programs) is relatively small next to the used buffers/caches,
and the kernel will swap out the rarely used programs to be able free up
memory for caching.
I think this is not too good idea on this system, what have allready 4GB of
memory.
The minimum free space is changeable thanks to VM.
Are you sure?

Hmm.
Last time, when i try the 2.6.16.x, i have lost close to 4000 users home,
and documents on XFS filesystem!
(a lot of directory have renamed to "/*" like this one: "/ost+found" in the
root.)
I don't want to try it again! :-)

Thanks, i will read this.
Anyway, this 64bit hanging issue is reproducible on my system. (normally
about daily, but if i try to trigger it, can be about 3-4x daily.)
If somebody is interested, please let me know, and i will send any useful
infos to debugging this! :-)
Cheers,
Janos
