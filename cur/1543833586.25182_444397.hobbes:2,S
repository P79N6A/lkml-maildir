I really don't think assigning a user namespace to a superblock is the
right way to go.  Seems to me like the _view_ into the filesystem is
what you want to modify.  That would seem to me to mean that each
'struct namespace' (filesystem namespace) or vfsmount would be assigned
a corresponding user namespace, *not* the superblock.
