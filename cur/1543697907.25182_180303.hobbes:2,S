Subject: [2.6.0-test10] cpufreq: 2G P4M won't go above 1.2G - cpuinfo_max_freq too low

Sorry... I posted this to the cpufreq list yesterday but I didn't get a 
response. Apologies for crossposting.
I've just upgraded to 2.6.0-test10 and am trying to use the new cpufreq stuff 
in there. I had everything working perfectly with 2.4.21-ac2, and the old 
/proc/cpufreq interface.
I have a P4 2ghz (in a thinkpad), but it's not running at over about 1.2ghz 
now. If I `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq` it 
tells me: "1198976". It should go faster than that. Similarly, 
scaling_available_frequencies says "149872 299744 449616 599488 749360 899232 
1049104 1198976"
Enabling the old interface in the kernel and doing a `echo -n 
0%0%100%performance > /proc/cpufreq` doesn't change things either.
Here is my /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 15
model           : 2

bogomips        : 2359.29
Any ideas?
Cheers,
Simon
