Also, I could defer registering the device with the rdma core until the 
alias interface is created by the user.  Thus the T3 device wouldn't be 
available for use until the ethxx:iw interface is created.
And I could log a WARN or INFO message if the iw_cxgb3 module is loaded 
and no ethxx:iw alias exists.  This would help clue in the user...
