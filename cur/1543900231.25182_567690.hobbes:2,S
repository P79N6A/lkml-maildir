Two reasons:
1) The processing does take time. We're sending (pseudo-)signals to other 
processes, and the amount of time it will take for them to enter the 
refrigerator will depend upon the number of processes there are, the 
scheduling algorithm being used, the rate at which they're forking and what 
other activity is occuring. That's why I said "normally" above.
2) Things do get broken. New functionality gets added which sometimes doesn't 
immediately play well with the freezer. In such cases, we want to fail nicely 
rather than wrongly assuming it will always work and waiting indefinitely.
Regards,
Nigel
