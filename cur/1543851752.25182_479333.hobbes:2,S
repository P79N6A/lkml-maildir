That doesn't sound correct to me.  The popf is far more expensive.  
There is no popfl $IMM instruction, so setting flags never can avoid the 
memory read and must make some more expensive assumptions about effects 
on further instruction stream (TF, DF, all sign flags for conditional 
jumps...).
Every processor I've ever measured it on, popf is slower.  On P4, for 
example, pushf is 6 cycles, and popf is 54.  On Opteron, it is 2 / 12.  
On Xeon, it is 7 / 91.
