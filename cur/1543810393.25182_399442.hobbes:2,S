Hi Folks,
sn_* symbols are "their" symbols so I can't see any legitimation for 
anyone else to not let them export their symbols as they want. They are 
doing a great job on linux to make it run scalable on the biggest 
machines on earth. Or don't you like the idea of running Linux on those 
supercomputers?
