ah. Thanks for the explanation!

indeed, that solves the xterm-spam Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Z problem here!

yeah, i use gnome-terminal exclusively. But testers looking for CFS 
regressions do run every shell on the planet :-)
gnome-terminal is also faster all around (at least on my box):
 $ (echo '#!/bin/bash' ; echo 'for ((i=0; i<100000; i++)); do echo $i; done') > 1.sh; chmod +x 1.sh; time xterm $HOME/1.sh; time gnome-terminal  -x ./1.sh
