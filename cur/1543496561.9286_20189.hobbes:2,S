I think you're on the wrong track by looking at the sending end. Linux increases
the cwnd by one for every received ack that acks new data. I don't know of any
TCP/IP stacks that do anything more fancy here, and as a pointed out in my 
other mail your simple "should count the number of packets" is an untolerable
burden to the implementation (and also would violate RFC2001). 
Slow start is such a critical thing to avoid internet meltdown, and with Linux
becoming more and more popular we really cannot risk any experiments in release
kernels here.
The problem is at the sender: it doesn't send enough acks. Linux 2.2
has a heuristic called quick-ack mode, where it acks the first packet immediately
when it thinks the other end is in slow start (this helps a lot).
For your specific application I think something like Andrea's no-delayed-acks
patch is the best, together with an increased initial cwnd. Overloading NO_DELAY
is not so hot a idea I think, because a lot of programs set it that could still
benefit from delayed acks.  But I think a sysctl or perhaps a new socket option
would be ok.
It would be interesting to know how the 2.2 stack does on your workload (not 
that I suggest that you should switch to it, but perhaps you could run a few 
benchmarks with your workload)

This is a valid criticism. The 200ms lower clamp was originally introduced in 2.0
to avoid same bad interactions with BSD based stacks, which use a 200ms fixed
slow delack timer (again mainly on slow modem connections). If it could be 
shown that dropping it doesn't harm 28.8 modem performance I would see no
reason to remove it.

The sk->users thing has been fixed in 2.2 (ATM HZ/20, maybe still a bit too
long). It is definitely a bad bug. Perhaps that should be backported to 2.0.
I don't know what 30s timer you're refering to (you don't mean the probe timer,
do you?)

I will try to get sysctls to turn off delayed ack and a reasonable way to 
increase initial cwnd into 2.2/2.3 (reasonable for cwnd should at least 
include a recompile, because otherwise it is too easy for users to cause too
much harm)
