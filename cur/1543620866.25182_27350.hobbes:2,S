Subject: [PATCH] pcnet32 workaround for IBM xSeries250
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is workaround for IBM xSeries250 onbord AMD79C975.
Auto negotiation failed with full duplex HUB.
If we set it to auto negotiation, this patch will be meaningless.
However, this patch is needed by auto-negotiation of full-duplex
The status is as follows:
setup HUB to half duplex. link OK
setup HUB to full duplex. link OK
Of course, AMD79C973 wrok too.
It's been tested by IBM staff too.
