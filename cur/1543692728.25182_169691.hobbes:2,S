Subject: 2.6: why no EXPORT_SYMBOL of get_sb_pseudo()?

fs/libfs.c:get_sb_pseudo() isn't exported to modules,
but a lot of the other stuff in fs/libfs.c is.
Is there a particular reason for this or just an oversight?
Making a private copy of get_sb_pseudo()'s definition works
in a module, but that's not exactly productive use of
programmer time or source and object code space.
