Anybody for adding a temporary patch, to come out in 2.6.2 or so once the dust
settles, that does something like this just before launching userspace:
	printk("\n");
	printk("Read 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt
\n");
#ifdef CONFIG_MODULES
	printk("\n");
	printk("In particular, if you haven't gotten module-init-tools, you're screwed\n");
#endif
	mdelay(5000);
Just a thought... ;)
