And when the API does change, like it has between Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4,
an email gets sent to this list describing the change of API.  Search
this lists archives to find out:
1. the reasons for the change
2. a complete description of the new bits of the API
There are projects around to try to pick this stuff up and put it on the
web in one place - its called the Kernel Wiki, and iirc it is on
sourceforge.
