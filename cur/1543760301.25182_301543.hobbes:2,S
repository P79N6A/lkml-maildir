I want to fill the virtual addresses of linearly mapped region. That is
physical addresses from 0 to MAXMEM (896 MB) are mapped by kernel at
virtual addresses PAGE_OFFSET to (PAGE_OFFSET + MAXMEM). Values of
PAGE_OFFSET and MAXMEM are already known and hard-coded.
I think I used the terminology kernel virtual address and that is adding
to the confusion. Kernel virtual addresses are not necessarily linearly
mapped. What I meant was kernel logical addresses whose associated
physical addresses differ only by a constant offset.
