I did not think this would solve all the OOM problems.  I do
think it will improve the situation in some instances.  The cost of
suppling the additional information is small - we do not want OOM
to trigger unless we really are OOM.  This patch can prevent the vm
from reporting some false OOMs...
Hope your audit discloses other problems.
