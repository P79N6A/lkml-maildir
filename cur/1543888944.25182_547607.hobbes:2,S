I use a serial PCI adaptor:
00:0b.0 Serial controller: NetMos Technology PCI 9835 Multi-I/O
Controller (rev 01)
Well, I have also not used ttyS2 for a while and recently I realized, it
does not like, when I past with a mouse a line into any terminal with a
line break (Input Output Error). ttyS1 (same card) works fine.

When I have 8250* build as modules I get:
ttyS0: OnBoard
ttyS1: PCI card, first Port
ttyS3: bogus, could have been meant to become ttyS2, second Port.
So there is weird stuff going on since recent Kernel versions. May be
since 2.6.19 until 2.6.21 (As said, I did not use the ttyS2 for a
while).
