IMHO for people who are not kbuild junkies the pattern is more clear 
with the current syntax.
But you should better ask some guinea pigs who have not already seen as 
many kernel Makefiles as I have...

Some of the cases have the following pattern:
config X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
        bool
        depends on X86_POWERNOW_K8 && ACPI_PROCESSOR
        depends on !(X86_POWERNOW_K8 = y && ACPI_PROCESSOR = m)
        default y
Your suggested syntax has to be enhanced with three additional
variables for handling such cases.
The complicated cases can be handled either in kconfig or in kbuild,
and I think kconfig is the better place for them:
Handling it in kconfig has the advantage that we also get a variable we 
can use in C code.
For all the *-if-m and *-m-if{,n}-* cases this is a huge advantage over 
having to express the whole dependency in each #if.
Compare
  #if defined(CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR) || (defined(CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR_MODULE && defined(MODULE))
with
  #ifdef CONFIG_X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
