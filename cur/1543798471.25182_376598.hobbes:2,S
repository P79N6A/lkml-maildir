You're missing the fact that we can't just change existing numbers. It 
just makes the ioctl not work.
A lot of the "size_t"'s got added because people had mis-understood the 
_IOR/W macros, and had done a "sizeof()" by hand, when the macro itself 
did the sizeof. Which caused the macro to make the ioctl number be based 
on "sizeof(sizeof(realsize))", which is the same as "sizeof(size_t)".
And because we MUST NOT change the ioctl number (regardless of whether the 
number shows the correct size or not), those got changed to use "size_t" 
to match historical - if incorrect - numbering.
The _IOR/W macros got fixed so that you now _cannot_ use anything but a 
real type, so the bug shouldn't happen again, but we're stuck with the old 
broken numbers.
The number is just a number, after all. We shouldn't be using the size 
encoding in the ioctl number, afaik (since for a _lot_ of them we can't 
depend on it anyway).
