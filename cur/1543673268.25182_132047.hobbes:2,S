OK, I'm confused then: earlier on, you reported this error:
  asm/agp.h: No such file or directory
My patch adds the following to asm-i386/agp.h:
diff -Nru a/include/asm-i386/agp.h b/include/asm-i386/agp.h
--- a/include/asm-i386/agp.h	Sat May 10 01:47:42 2003

 #endif
So, either you're using a platform which I don't know supports AGP, or
the patch didn't apply cleanly (perhaps because you're using an old
kernel that doesn't have asm/agp.h yet?).
Could you shed some light?  Once I understand why things are failing
for you, I shall be happy to update the patch accordingly.
