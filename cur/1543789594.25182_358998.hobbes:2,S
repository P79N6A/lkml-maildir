Subject: [PATCH-STABLE] Fix data-corruption bug in md when delayed recovery is interrupted.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  There is a bug in md/raid which is fixed by this patch.
  The patch should apply to almost any 2.6 kernel.
  A fix has already been submitted to akpm/linus for 2.6.14.
  This patch should be included in 2.6.13.5 (if there is one).
  The problem occurs if:
     two or more raid arrays share a physical device and
     two or more of them require recovery (onto a spare) and
     one or more is 'DELAYED' waiting for another to finish and
     the -resync thread receives SIGKILL, as can happen during
       shutdown (init send SIGKILL to everything) if the arrays are not
       first stopped with 'mdadm -Ss' or 'raidstop -a'.
   The problem is that the recovery will appear to be complete, but no
   data will have been copied onto the 'spare' drive that is now a
   full part of the array.  Naturally this can result in data
   corruption.
   To avoid this problem (until the patch is applied), do not shutdown
   a computer will any array that reports "resync=DELAYED" in
   /proc/mdstat - stop the array first with 'mdadm -Ss'.
