This could very well be related to the problem reported by Paul Mackerras 
about a month or two ago, see:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=5176974
I think the hub driver's power management code may be at fault.  It needs
to cancel the status interrupt URB when suspending and resubmit it when
waking up; right now it probably does neither one.
Or maybe I'm wrong about that.  Perhaps it's okay to leave the URB active.  
If that's the case, then the root hub power management code needs to be 
changed to restart the status URB timer after a wakeup.
I'm not sure how the design is intended to work, but either way something 
needs to be fixed.
