I tried to find how it is supposed to work, and after I tried to boot kernel
(at home) with it, I can say that it does not work...
I tried it only at home (where arp table is empty by default), so I did not
test whether lock is released properly (if there will be arp_seq_start
and arp_seq_stop, with pos == 0 and without intervening arp_seq_next, you'll 
unlock unlocked arp_tbl.lock in arp_seq_stop (and from what I see in
seq_file.c, it can happen), but when I just tried to ping various addresses 
at vmware's vmnet8, I got very short output of /proc/net/arp, although it 
should contain couple of entries:

Not something I expect. Before reboot it was listing all 6 addresses, not
only first.
