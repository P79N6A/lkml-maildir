Nah! The problem I described in this mail happened a long, long time ago
(in a galaxy far, far away) and was exactly a "no command response"
(IIRC) error logged continuously to the console. Now, the problem I'm
experiencing is the slowdown-when-sending you may have read about which,
unfortunately, doesn't throw any kind of errors to the console ;-)
Thanks for your support, Andrew.
