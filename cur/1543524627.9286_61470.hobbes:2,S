Subject: command line args trucation? (ok 2.2.10, broken 2.2.13)

Has something changed between 2.2.10 and 2.2.13 to cause the command 
line to be truncated?
From /proc/cmdline
2.2.13
auto BOOT_IMAGE=vmlinuz-probe ro root=100 mem=120M ramdisk_size=20480
console=ttyS0,960
2.2.10
auto BOOT_IMAGE=vmlinuz-probe ro root=100 mem=120M ramdisk_size=20480
console=ttyS0,9600n8
Could this be something in the way that the kernel was built? The 
2.2.13 is mine, built on RH6.1 (egcs-1.1.2), but the 2.2.10 is my
colleages built and may even have been built ages ago under RH5.2
(gcc-2.7.2.3).
Thanks,
	Barrie
