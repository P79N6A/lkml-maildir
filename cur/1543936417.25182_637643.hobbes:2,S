Ubuntu refuses to be power user friendly. They've forgotten the True
Meaning (tm) of Linux and try to be Windows-friendly, i.e., No Choices
(tm).

The alternative CD installer still looks like a semi-dumbed-down
debian installer. Hell, even the command-line base install is severely
bloated - it's the exact opposite of LFS or gentoo.
Still, it's *usable* in comparison to the livecd.

Idiot friendliness and no exceptions to power users (e.g.., bloated
init scripts, UUID fstab). I switched to debian-unstable ages ago
*just* because apt is _really_ easy to use. Which I use secondarily to
Gentoo, where things Just Work (tm), once you patch the package
ebuilds to process your .patch files anyway and, while the packages
have *lots* of patches, it doesn't bloat the code *and* you can
disable the patches with the "vanilla" USE flag.
