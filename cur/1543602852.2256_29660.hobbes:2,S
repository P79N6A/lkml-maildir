That's why its called experimental ;-).
Currently we have "SWSUSP" signature, SWAP-FILE gets replaced with
SWSUSP on suspend, and SWAP-FILE is written back on resume. That way,
you can not resume two times from one image.
Additional safety measure could be added: on every swapon, check if
"SWSUSP" is there, and replace it with "SWAP-FILE" if so. (Currently
it says -EINVAL). That should make it pretty safe.
Of course, you'll still be able to shoot yourself in the foot even
with added "security". Just don't do it, then.
