This looks OK to me. It really simplifies the code there a lot too.
The only questions I have are: should it be on by default? I don't think
we ever reached an agreement. I'd say yes, after a run in -mm because it
does potentially fix corner cases where lower zones get filled with un-
freeable memory which could have been satisfied with higher zones.
And second, any chance you could you port it to the mm patches already in
-mm? Won't be a big job, just some clashes in __alloc_pages...

mm-higher-order-watermarks.patch
mm-higher-order-watermarks-fix.patch

Thanks,
Nick
