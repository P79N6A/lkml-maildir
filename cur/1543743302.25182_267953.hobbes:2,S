The election is over, we can adopt a civil non-confrontational tone 
again... Linus is not always right, but like most people he responds 
better to "let me give you additional information" than "I know more 
than you, take my word for it."
In this case, I think Dick does have a point on memory to cache use. It 
appears from what little stuff I have here that with HT cache access is 
serialized, and that memory access, even to L1 cache, might under some 
circumstances be delayed. I won't guess if you would ever see that in 
practice.
Getting information out of noisy measurements is not easy, and while 
Dick is probably right that the lowest time is the "real" time, if the 
average is lower doing something else, isn't that what we want?
My response test reports low, high, average, median, and 90th percentile 
values, and depending on whether you want the best average, best 
typical, or worst case avoidance you might find any of them useful. Oh, 
and S.D. of the data to hint on how much you trust the results. I don't 
think any of the test programs produce the definitive result, and I see 
that results change depending on the CPU.
I think there are a lot of things more deserving this level of 
consideration.
