Actually I don't need to find somebody to explain it to me. RFC 2119
makes it very clear:
3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
   may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
   particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
   carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
Would you care to explain what valid reasons you have for ignoring
§3.6.4 of RFC2822, and why those override the implications of doing so
(which, as stated, is that you break the threading of your replies and
cause the signal:noise ratio to degrade).
