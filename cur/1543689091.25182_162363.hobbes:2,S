Ugh, I've been running a bunch of usb stress tests today and kept having
the uhci driver halt with this error.
After this patch, it all works with no problems that I can detect
(ripping a cd image at the same time as syncing a visor and running a
loop-back test on a usb-serial device and using the mouse and keyboard
to type.)

So, Johannes, unless you violently disagree, I'm going to apply this
patch and send it upwards as it does solve the problem for at least 2
people here :)
thanks,
