I've got a similar problem. I have a motherboard with the standard 2 IDE
controllers. The primary has two FUJITSU drives (1x6.4Gb UDMA, 1x10.8Gb
NO UDMA - or so it seems), the secondary has 1xASUS 34X CDROM,
1xAOPEN CD-ReWriter (4x4x20x).
In my init scripts, specifically in my "local" script, I activate 32 bit IO
on both FUJITSU drives, and UDMA on the 6Gb one. If I attempt to activate
UDMA on the newer 10Gb disk, it gives errors similar to those above and then
resets the ide device. I deduced that the newer disk doesn't like UDMA.
However, the older disk operates at 12Mb/sec, whereas the newer goes at about
5, therefore since the 10Gb is newer, I believe that the problem is with
Linux not the drive, since it ought to be as fast (or faster) than the old
one - shorly? Also, since both disks are on the same controller, it seems to
cause throughput problems when both are accessed together. Is it recommened
that I move the drivesaround so that there is only one hdd on each controller
to prevent the two drives simultaneous access reducing throughput?
can send more details if asked.
