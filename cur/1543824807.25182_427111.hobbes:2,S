This is possible only if the video memory management is in the kernel. Reason: 
userspace may also want to use double buffering, and we definitely want to 
allocate the "other (maybe third) buffer" somewhere in the free video memory. 
And allocating a lot of system RAM on oops seems to be a very bad idea (cascade 
of oopses may follow).
Also, did anyone measure the video RAM usage during a typical Xgl session (i.e.: 
is there really enough free video RAM, not occupied by various caches)?
Although, a Microsoft-ish "lost context, please redraw" solution has been 
already proposed.
