What we need is a way to have _both_ possibilities. Even a
(gross) hack to do both is better than to run into the problem
you paint above.
Maybe we want to just list "file" as a standard file with the
dir listing but be able to open "\file" as an albod directory
when we ask for it. Most (almost all) non-albod-aware programs
have the possibility of explicitly entering a file/dir name to
perform an action on so it will just be a minor inconvenience
while some system tools will be converted.
Besides, when you use file/logo.gif the system doesn't have
to guess what you want to do so it'll be not that much of a
problem once we've got a method in place of accessing an albod
in both ways.
