That's the one. suspend-to-disk works, but suspend-to-ram leaves the fam 
going, and does not come back no matter how many times you press the power 
button. You need to kill it (twice) by holding the power button for five 
seconds (which is the "hard-power-off" signal to the southbridge, when 
everything else is locked up).
suspend-to-disk really shuts off, and comes back after just a single power 
button event. Of course, it's slow and boring, I'd much rather have STR
working ;)
