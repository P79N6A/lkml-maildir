Careful there: this is actually listed in one of Microsoft's PC
hardware design guides, but is not mandatory.  There are plenty of
systems that are shipped with BIOS's that are effectively hard-wired
in "Plug and Play OS mode".
For example, essentially all current laptop BIOS's do not initialize
their CardBus bridges.  That means the interrupt line register is 0,
and bridge registers are not mapped.  Discovering the PCI interrupt
mapping is somewhat tricky, and is one of the things that pains me
often.
