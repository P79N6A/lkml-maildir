Hello,
Not much about this error in the archives, so I post it,
maybe it does matter for someone.
Kernel 2.2.1:
I found the following in the syslog:
Feb  1 19:58:26 Yikes kernel: *** tcp.c:tcp_data bug acked < copied
There were lots of ftp traffic but nothing really special. 
I checked tcp.c but it contains only a history line that this bug was indeed
fixed. :-) 
Happy hacking,
grin
ps: as always, please CC the possible answers on my email.
ps2: Anyone knows _documentation_ (yes, you heard it right!) on iproute? The
one included with the kernel is the same piece Noah carried in the ark.
"Badly outdated" just not empasizing enough how old it is. Maybe there's a
hidden doc on 'ip' and 'tc', somewhere deep in the web...?
