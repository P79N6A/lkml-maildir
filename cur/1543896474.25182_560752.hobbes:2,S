I tend to see "do {} while()" as an exception to this.  I find the 
construct is sufficiently rare that it helps to emphasize it a bit.  For 
example if I'm scanning code and I see:
	while (foo != NULL);
in the corner of my eye, I'm going to think "huh?".  But:
	} while (foo != NULL);
visually "parses" properly, regardless of how near or far the 
corresponding "do  {" is.
(And of course, its consistent with the super extra special while-while 
loop:
	while (foo != NULL) {
		foo = bar();
		piffle();
	} while (foo != NULL);	// make sure we loop properly
;)
