Never said that framebuffer can ever be faster than text mode, the
comparison was made against vgacon only. The reason why vgacon is
slow is because the screen buffer of vgacon is the actual VGA RAM.
So all operations (copies, fills, blits) are done in io memory.
And access to graphics memory is always slow, especially reads.

This point was never questioned.
