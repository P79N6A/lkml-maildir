So...  don't do that then?  Is it likely that anyone would want to stick a
probe on the kprobe code itself?

There's an old unix convention that section markers (start, end, edata,
etc) are declared `int'.  For some reason we don't do that in the kernel.

hm, who put the unneeded braces in there?

What's that comment mean?
