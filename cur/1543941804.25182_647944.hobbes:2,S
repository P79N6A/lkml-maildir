e7d0362dd41e760f340c1b500646cc92522bd9d5 should have been folded into
de4d1db369785c29d68915edfee0cb70e8199f4c prior to merging.  We now and for
ever have a window of breakage which screws up git bisection.  Which I
just hit.  Which is the only reason I discovered the file's existence.
Please do not merge pieces of generic kernel infrastructure while keeping
it all secret on the netdev list.  Ever.  That code has a number of deficiencies
which I and probably others would have noted had it been offered to us
for review.
