This is an update of the tmpfs acl patches against 2.6.15-git4. (The
first version of these patches was posted on 2 February 2005.) We'll
have our /dev tree on tmpfs in the future, and we need acls there to
manage device inode permissions of logged-in users. Other distributions
will be in exactly the same situation, and need this patchset as well.
Andrew, if this stuff looks good enough to you, could you please let it
live in -mm for some time?
Thanks,
Andreas
