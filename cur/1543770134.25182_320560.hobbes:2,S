_if_ you want to read the file, use fget() and vfs_read() on the file
descriptor you get passed. It is however considered rather bad style to
do file I/O from drivers. As Brian Gerst said, better use mmap in user
space and pass the pointer via ioctl() or write().

Your assumption that the driver should parse the media file structure
is probably wrong. You should rather do as much as possible in a user
space library. Pass a file name to a library call and have that 
work with all the complex parts of the file format, then define an
ioctl interface for the driver on a relatively low level.
Or even better, don't use ioctl() at all but implement only read()/write()
in the driver. E.g. for MPEG acceleration, you might want to have an
interface where you write a series of macro blocks to the character
device and read back pixel data.
