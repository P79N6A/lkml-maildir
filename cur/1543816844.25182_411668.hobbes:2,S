I don't think I could give a complete answer...
I guess it could be stated as the increase in the complexity of
the rest of the code for someone who doesn't know anything about
the virtualization implementation.
Completely non intrusive is something like 2 extra function calls
to/from generic code, changes to data structures are transparent
(or have simple wrappers), and there is no shared locking or data
with the rest of the kernel. And it goes up from there.
Anyway I'm far from qualified... I just hope that with all the
work you guys are putting in that you'll be able to justify it ;)
