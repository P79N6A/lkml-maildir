There are occasional reports of problems with kernels compiled with 
gcc 4.1 that vanish when using older versions of gcc.
AFAIK, until now noone has ever debugged whether that's a gcc bug, 
gcc exposing a kernel bug or gcc exposing a hardware bug.
Comparing your report and [1], it seems that if these are the same 
problem, it's not a hardware bug but a gcc or kernel bug.
