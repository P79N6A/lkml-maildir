Would it be an idea to place this interface in-between the
per-cpu free page lists and the buddy allocator, so we can
move a batch of pages around at once and do the hinting in
a batched fashion ?
That way the overhead will be acceptable not just on S390
(where things are millicoded), but also on hypervisor based
virtualization like Xen.
Easy enough to pass a vector of pages to the hypervisor.
