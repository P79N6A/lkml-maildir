On every normal (default Red Hat or Debian at least) system
this is already trivial:
ln /dev/zero /tmp/zero
ln /dev/hda ~/hda
ln /dev/mem /var/tmp/README
So the user often can provide device nodes. The above is _worse_
than allowing "mount --bind ..." because the admin has to search
the whole filesystem to find such links.
Never mind that though; it doesn't matter how the devices are
created. Social engineering can work. Once the device problem
is taken care of, chroot() becomes useful for normal users.
BTW, it is way wrong that /dev/zero should be needed at all.
Such use is undocumented ("man zero", "man mmap") anyway, and
AFAIK one should use mmap() with MAP_ANON instead. Not that
the documentation on MAP_ANON is any good either, but at least
the mere existence of the flag is mentioned.
