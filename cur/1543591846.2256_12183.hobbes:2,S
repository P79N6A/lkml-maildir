The document tree (21 - 26 GB) is small enough to fit in RAM (32 GB),
so the speed of the disk is not likely to have a noticable impact.

A lot of people during the Mindcraft discussion made the mistake
of calling the test unfair.
Regardless of whether the initial test was fair, it actually showed 
interesting performance weaknesses in Linux, ones the kernel team
has successfully addressed.

That's certainly true.  On the other hand, worrying about how many
nanoseconds a system call takes isn't really an issue in the
real world, but kernel hackers love to optimize system call overhead
anyway.  This is the same sort of intellectual challenge.  Plus,
it impresses the beancounters, and they're the ones who buy the
systems and keep us all employed.
