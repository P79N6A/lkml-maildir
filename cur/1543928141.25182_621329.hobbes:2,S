Subject: [PATCH 0/2] UML - Two rediffs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/26/231

These two should wait for 2.6.25.
They are rediffs against rc3-mm1 after they conflicted with other
stuff last week.  In particular, the first one, which cleans up UML's
use of TASK_SIZE, is vulnerable to the a.out work.
