Of course, I realised that.  Actually, what the code does is take an
initial badness factor (the memory usage), then divide it using goodness
factors (some based on time, some purely arbitrary), both of which can be
considered dimensionless.  Also, at the end, the absolute value is not
considered - we simply look at the biggest one and kill it.  All
"denormalisation" does is scale all the values, it doesn't affect which one
actually turns out biggest.
