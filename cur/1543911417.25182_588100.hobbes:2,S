It happens so often that people send mangled patches that it might be useful 
to create a wiki page or something with the most common email clients and a 
sample configuration that prevents them from mangling patches. Maybe somebody 
feels like doing so in his / her spare time.

I think this is also a matter of conding style. Documentation/CodingStyle 
says:
"The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a hard limit."
So actually there shouldn't be any line longer than that. Perhaps it would be 
nice to create a patches that shorten the lines and to send them to the 
kernel-janitors ml.

see above.
