Well, you can keep it masked, but a more important point is that I've 
entirely neglected local interrupts.  This might work for IRQs, but for 
local timer or thermal or IPIs, using the tasklet based replay simply 
will not work.

Yes.  Unfortunately now both do_IRQ and all the smp_foo interrupt 
handlers need to detect and queue for replay, but fortunately they all 
have the interrupt number conveniently on the stack.
