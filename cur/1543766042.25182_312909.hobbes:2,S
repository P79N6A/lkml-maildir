Hi,
i'd like to know how much time does linux kernel run with disabled
interrupts. So i would like to remap the instructions capable of
disabling interrupt to other ones which count how much this time is...
Does already exist a patch or tool capable to give me a magnitude
order of the time spent by the kernel with disables interrupts?
In uniprocessor systems, can i state that the only instruction capable
of disabling interrupts is cli?
Thank u very much
Francesco Oppedisano
