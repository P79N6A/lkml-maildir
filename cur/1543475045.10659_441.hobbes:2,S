	I was wondering .. do you think it would be relivant to set
	MSG_PROXY on any of the packet's beeing redirected as all the
	#ifdef CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY
	code has checks for MSG_PROXY .. and apon testing for this found
	that in the code, MSG_PROXY is never set on redirected packets.
	is this possibly why this is busted per chance?
	You do realize I have cooked my last remaining brain cell's in
	order to bring you this information.
