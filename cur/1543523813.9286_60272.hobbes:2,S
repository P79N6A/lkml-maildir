I've updated the kernel to 2.2.15pre5 and applied your boobytrap patch.
I'm now getting these messages:
Jan 28 13:31:28 dracula kernel: kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1)
task from c0180e0f!
Jan 28 13:31:28 dracula kernel: kmem_cache_alloc called by non-running (1)
task from c0167ba4!
(these messages are network related as I can see)
Using ksymoops I get:
>>EIP: c0180e0f <tcp_v4_conn_request+f7/35c>
>>EIP: c0167ba4 <alloc_skb+58/dc>
I get only this two addresses in the log... always when I'm doing
something via ppp0.
I hope this helps,
Gianluca
