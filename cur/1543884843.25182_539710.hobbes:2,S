Thanks, the lkml volume lately forces me to skip a lot, so it's quite

I don't quite understand. With the menuconfig changes more menu entries 
should  appear on the left side, so I don't understand why you have to 
"drill down" to reach it.
The rule for menu to appear on the left side is relatively simple - all 
its parents must be of menu type as well. So if a menuconfig is on the 
right side it must have a normal config entry as parent.

If the frontend wants to change the behaviour of a menuconfig, it can 
already do that, so this doesn't require a syntax change.
