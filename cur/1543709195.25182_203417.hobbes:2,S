Hi,
i have a nforce3 mainboard with onboard sii3512 sata controller and athlon64 processor. (shuttle sn85)
i'm not subscribed to a list but i frequently read the lkml archives
after changing the pci id from 3112 to 3512 for the SII3112 in pci_id.h the kernel works as expected, but
if i enable io-apic support on uniprocessor i get 'lost interupts' and then dma timeouts.
in the documentation is told that it would not matter if i enable io-apic on UP when not present.
what exactly is the difference between 'local apic' and 'io-apic on up' and how do i determine if my computer has such an 'io apic'?
thank you very much
sorry for my poor english
Lars Täuber
