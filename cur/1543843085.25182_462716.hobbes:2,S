I've just checked, this are some of the callers of
vfp_single_normaliseround (last argument is 'func'):
in vfp_single_fuito: 
	vfp_single_normaliseround(sd, &vs, fpscr, 0, "fuito");
in vfp_single_fsito:
	vfp_single_normaliseround(sd, &vs, fpscr, 0, "fsito");
in vfp_single_fnmul:
	vfp_single_normaliseround(sd, &vsd, fpscr, exceptions, "fnmul");
It definitely looks like we want the calling function to be printed
here.
