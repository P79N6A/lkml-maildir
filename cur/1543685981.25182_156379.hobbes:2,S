Neat.  I really like extents, and think this is the best long-term 
approach.  Apparently the ext3 maintainers do, too, because tytso/sct's 
"ext roadmap" paper publishing a while ago describes extents, too.  (I 
wish I had a URL for that)
Anyway, something to keep in mind:
Changing the underlying disk format without bumping the filesystem 
revision is a hugely bad idea.  I disagreed with merging htree (even 
though its backward compat) without bumping the filesystem version, too.
Vendors, distributors, OEMs, etc. all test against existing on-disk 
formats, when they release their products.  When the filesystem format 
for an existing filesystem, in production, changes underneath them, they 
tend to get worried and annoyed.  So, to all ext developers,
Please add <it> to ext4 not ext3!
