Hello!

This is not true, the maximum is 0.5 in your case.

This is not true, delack timer inflates ato. pingpong=0 is not quickack
mode, it means that the session is unidirectional stream, which
is correct in your case.
> 2) the pingpong is never re-activated,
It MUST NOT. It is activated on transactional sessions only.

When m > ato, the sample is invalid, apparently it is triggered by
a random delay at sender. When real ato increases, increase
is made in delack timer, not through estimator.

It is necessary to provide more or less sane behaviour on interactive
session when ato > 100msec. Clamping by rto just does not make any sense.

Yes, when window is not opening, it is not required. Delack is send
when window is advanced.
Shortly, I still do not understand what kind of pathalogy happens in your
case (particularly, difference in adevrtised window before and after
applying your patch is confusing _a_ _lot_, I really would like
to look at larger tcpdump, covering beggining of the sssion),
but all the 5 items are surely wrong.
Unnumbered 6th one may be right, the heuristic with expansion twice
have no explanation, I think it can be relaxed even more.
