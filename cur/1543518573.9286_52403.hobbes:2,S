Hi all.
This can be a bit off-topic, but i found it interesting.
Someone's here has already tried to open in Sun's StarOffice a file
inside a mounted Netware volume? The situation:
After a hand-maded mount of a Netware volume, i open kfm and see all my
files in netware's dir, and just the files that the server allows me to
see. So i switch to StarOffice and go to open a file. I can't see
anything above the mounted dir.
Is a "bug" in staroffice, a bug in ncpfs (i don't think so, 'cause i can
see my files in any other place), or staroffice does access in a
"raw-like" manner? Using a NFS volume works quite well (except for my
hardware server troubles).
Cheers,
