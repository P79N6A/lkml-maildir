To use them?
I did not want to write
some_xt_target() {
    if(skb->nh.iph->protocol == IPPROTO_TCP)
        do_this();
    else
        do_that();
}
since the xt_tcpudp module provides far more checks than just the protocol
(TCP/UDP), like
    /* To quote Alan:
       Don't allow a fragment of TCP 8 bytes in. Nobody normal
       causes this. Its a cracker trying to break in by doing a
       flag overwrite to pass the direction checks.
    */
(see xt_tcpudp.c)
