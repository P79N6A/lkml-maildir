Worse, it's needed to get x86_64 to compile.
They are defined in include/asm-x86/bitops_64.h (which gets
included). They are used to optimize the case where the
bitmap size is known at compile time and not larger than
BITS_PER_LONG. Undeffing them here is the easiest way to get
things to compile, here.
