Subject: df hangs on nfs automounter in 2.6.0-current

Current 2.6.0 (2.6.0-test5+BK as of 16.09) hangs on df when
the am_utils automounter is in use. It displays hda* partitions and next
by mountpoint list is amd but then df hangs, wchan is rpc_execu*
dmesg only tells
nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
like it always does with current 2.6 kernels for me.
x86, debian unstable.
