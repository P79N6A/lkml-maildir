Always use '-fpic' in CFLAGS when compiling for shared objects (.so)
Otherwise (as in your case) the compiler is allowed to emit machine code
that may not work in shared objects.
When I was hit by this error, the offending library was istself linked to 
another, static library. This isn't allowed either. IIRC my fix was compiling
that .a library with -fpic :)
