I don't think it does. The process with the highest priority
must run first, regardless of anything else.
You could say "it is similar to running out of CPU bandwidth", or
"it is like running on a CPU that is 80% the speed". And it may be
similar in terms of total throughput.
But the important elements are lost. The standard provides a
deterministic scheduling order, and a deterministic scheduling
latency (of course this doesn't mean a great deal for Linux, but
I think we're good enough for a lot of soft-rt applications now).

Oh yes, and that would surely have to be the only sane default
setting. But I then ask, why put this complexity into the kernel
in the first place? And is the cost of significantly breaking the
API and lying to userspace acceptable?

I think the priority limit is the better way, because the % CPU
available to real time threads approach essentially gives you no
realtime scheduling at all.
By limiting priority, you can at least construct userspace solutions
to managing RT threads.

Possibly. But the people who want a solution seem to be in a very
small minority, and I'm not sure how much you care about efficiency.
