Lots of drivers printk messages when they load - IMO it's useful info.
E.g. how else could Etienne discover that he accidentally built a kernel
with dozens of i2c bus drivers (and probably all of the hwmon drivers)
built-in by accident?
(But, I'll send the trivial patch to lm-sensors list if you still want it.)

Wow, that's a huge delay.  One alternative would be for i2c slaves to behave
more like USB and do the probing asynchronous to driver load; i.e. 'modprobe
w83627hf' returns before the chip is actually recognized and attached.
OTOH, that brings up all the related problems.  E.g., you could no longer
expect this simple fragment of a RC script to work...
	modprobe i2c-sis96x
	modprobe asb100
	sensors -s
Short of fixing all that... one has to accept that (1) i2c bus probing is
slow, and (2) some i2c busses themselves are not reliably detectable...
...thus (3) it's a bad idea to build all of that into your monolithic kernel.
As Jean suggests, either use modules or build only the drivers for hardware
you actually have.
