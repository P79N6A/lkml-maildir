True but you have emergency *_node function that do not take nodelists.

If you get to the emergency lists then you are already in a tight memory 
situation. In that situation it does not make sense to worry about the 
node number the memory is coming from. kmalloc_node is just a kmalloc with 
an indication of a preference of where the memory should be coming from. 
The node locality only influences performance and not correctness.
There is no change to the way the slab allocator works. Just drop the 
*_node variants.
