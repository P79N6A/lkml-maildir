Hi!
Is there recent version somewhere? I found one version
(pxa27x-0218.patch), but it is *really* old.
I'd like to connect zaurus c-3000 to desktop somehow... what is the
recommended way? I wanted to use bluetooth originally, but billionton
card is way too slow.
Is there chance for usb-gadget support for collie (sl-5500, sa1100
cpu)?
