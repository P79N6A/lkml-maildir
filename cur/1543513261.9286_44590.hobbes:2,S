 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Not true. Most. 
The 16PCI954 at least has readable fifo levels.

As we have a rs_single etc etc. we could do something similar with the
"transmit" routine.
	.... [info->type.uart_type] -> transmit_func (info)
and then have 
	
	ox16c954_transmit (... info)
	{
		bytes_to_send = uart->xmit_fifo_size - serial_icr_read (info, UART_TFL);
		...
	}
	normal_transmit (... inf)
	{
		if (! read (... status) & FIFO_EMPTY) return;
		bytes_to_send = uart->xmit_fifo_size;
		....
	}
Alternatively:
	....transmit (...info)
	{
		
		if (....uart.type == UART_954)
			bytes_to_send = uart->xmit_fifo_size - serial_icr_read (info, UART_TFL);
		else {
			if (! read (... status) & FIFO_EMPTY) return;
			bytes_to_send = uart->xmit_fifo_size;
		}
		....
	}
The ISA bus accesses are FAR too slow to do more than absolutely
neccesary. But memory accesses, although expensive compared to CPU
processing is cheap enough. If we call a different routine or switch
to different code depending on an often accessed flag in a cache line
that is already often accessed, the cost will be pretty low.

I don't agree.

David Woodhouse was involved in a project where he needed guarantees
about being able to send a sequence of bytes without any "idle" bits.
(i.e. after the stop bit always a start bit). With a 16 byte fifo, you
can use e.g. half the fifo to make that guarantee a lot easier. The
way it is implemented right now means we have to meet the
realtime-one-character interrupt latency. I feel a lot better if the
system achieves the interrupt in one character-time all of the time
but then the software is implemented to require only "within 8
character-times". That'd be nice.
