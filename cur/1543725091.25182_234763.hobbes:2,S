The BIOS default setting is to have all PCI interrupts on 11.
Try spreading them out manually.

Ohhh.  I recognize that one, I had problems with that one too.  I solved
it by adding hci_usb to the hotplug blacklist.  However, after
upgrading to 2.6.8-rc1-bk2 (from 2.6.6, so the fix might have been
somewhere in between), I could safely remove that from the blacklist
again.  YMMV.
