No, not for the MMC on collie.  At least, the patch to the 2.4 kernel
which I based my 2.6 code on did not have any MMC parts, and the
openzaurus distro at the time still included the binary module in the
rom.  
IIRC, Chris Larson signed a NDA and got the specs for the MMC device on
collie to develop it for 2.6, but I don't think anything ever came of
it.  I also might be remembering he signed a NDA for some other
component, but I think it was the MMC device.  Also, the poodle and
collie used different device controllers, so the work will not transfer
over.  :(
