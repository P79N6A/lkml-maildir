i imagine marking vcc->dev = NULL would be pretty close to the above.
most operations going into the driver check vcc->dev already and it
might actually handle this correct w/o too much extra effort.  you
might also set some flags on the vcc's like ATM_VF_RELEASED etc etc.
of course, this sort of implies that the vcc's are on their own list
and not on a list that is actually part of the atm dev.  (see latest
rfc patch).
