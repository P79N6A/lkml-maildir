Right.. I did that 1 month ago, which is already far away in my memory.
Looking back at this, here is what is the real situation. I attach the
patches that fixes the comments accordingly as reply to my original
posts.
- "Redux" immediate values : no need to put a breakpoint, therefore, no
  need to know where the instruction starts. It's therefore OK to have a
  REX prefix.
- More reentrant immediate value : uses a breakpoint. Needs to know the
  instruction's first byte. This is why we keep the "instruction size"
  variable, so we can support the REX prefixed instructions too.
Therefore, the "q" and "r" constraints are OK : they _allow_ REX
prefixes.
