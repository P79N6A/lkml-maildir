   You should never need it. Ethernet, hubs, switches, routers, internet
   backbones etc will all cause packet re-ordering. You should also expect
   the percentage of re-ordered frames on the net to rise and rise. 
   
But to be honest, NAPI was meant to dramatically reduce the "SMP
specific" causes of packet reordering.  When a driver does use NAPI,
the reordering due to SMP goes way down.
