Correct me, if I'm wrong, but FAT (MSDOS, VFAT short name) uses
CP852, and VFAT long name uses unicode. JOLIET also uses unicode.
CP1250 is not used anywhere near to filesystems in Microsoft Windows,
even Microsoft was bright enough to use only one (MSDOS compatible)
encoding (+ unicode) on externally visible filenames.
And your system itself (userspace) should use ISO-8859-2, so I see
no need for CP1250 - everything works fine here without it. Maybe you
are creating your CDROMs with 16bit-encoded CP1250 instead of unicode,
but then you should replace your CDROM creating software.
