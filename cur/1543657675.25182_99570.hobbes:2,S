Ups, you are right. I thought about CONFIG_NOMMU..
Should read:
proc-y := proc_nommu.o
proc-$(CONFIG_MMU) := proc_mmu.o
If CONFIG_MMU is 'y', then the first assignment is overwritten.
The same principle (pattern?), but with reversed logic.
But this one is not that nice, because the common case overwrite the
un-common case.
