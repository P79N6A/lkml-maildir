Very much so. I'm grabbing the X source right now to find out exactly
what games they're playing. Hopefully I'll not regret it too much.

btw, iirc you were the guy who wanted agpgart initialised sooner
due to the way the i810 framebuffer worked ?
How much sooner are we talking ? What puzzles me, is looking
at the link order in the makefiles, agpgart should already be
getting initialised before the framebuffer code, but doesn't
seem to be for reasons unknown..
Another issue on this same case, is that for this to work out,
we'll need some kconfig magick so that if the framebuffer is 'Y'
rather than 'M' the i810 gart module must be forced to 'Y' too.
