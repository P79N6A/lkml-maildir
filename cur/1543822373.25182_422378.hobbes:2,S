Profiling, monitoring, and control (workload management).
Sounds like something that at the moment, most users and most
applications will not use, most of the time.
I won't question the usefulness of the statistics to some
applications, but at the moment is it is reasonable to add this
overhead for everyone, or even for all tasks? Adding a bit more
work for those that want the stats won't be too bad.
Thanks,
Nick
