There is no obvious way to determine that an executable will drop
capabilities. You have the halting problem to deal with.
There is no reasonable way to add this feature to an existing executable.
Other than the above two problems, yeah, it was a nice idea.
----------------------
I had an interesting idea a while ago. One could encode all the logic into
the executable header as a series of load/store and math operations.
(as an interpreted byte-code, without backwards jumps)
load  fI,r1
load  pI,r2
and   r1,r2,r3
load  fP,r2
or    r2,r3,r1
store r1,pP
load  fE,r2
and   r1,r2,r3
store r3,pE
There could be an enforced mask at the end too.
To determine what the result will be, just interpret the byte code.
Since there can be no loops or recursion, calculation would be fast.
