Maybe I have to be more precise in the statement "gcc 2.95.2 is buggy".
I just installed gcc 2.95.2 freshly ftp'ed from ftp.gnu.org, and
% /usr/bin/gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-suse-linux/2.95.2/specs
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
% /usr/bin/gcc -Wall -O2 -o bug bug.c; ./bug
0x84800000
% /usr/gcc/aeb/bin/gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/gcc/aeb/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.95.2/specs
gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)
% /usr/gcc/aeb/bin/gcc -Wall -O2 -o nobug bug.c; ./nobug
0x0
So, not all versions of gcc 2.95.2 are equal.
% rpm -qf /usr/bin/gcc
gcc-2.95.2-51
This is from a SuSE distribution, I forget which, not very recent.
Revised summary: gcc-2.95.2-51 from SuSE is buggy.
