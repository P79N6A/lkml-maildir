I'm announcing last version of the libtune API, that has been developped 
to unify the way developers have to access Linux kernel tunables, system 
information, resource consumptions.
User documentation can be found at 
http://akt.sf.net/doc/aktapi.doc.01.html
Design documentation can be found at 
http://akt.sf.net/doc/aktapi.design.07.html
The sources can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=136028
Next step of the project will consist in making the kernel able to tune 
the resources as it sees appropriate.
Any comment is welcome.
Please CC-me since I'm not subscribed.

Nadia
