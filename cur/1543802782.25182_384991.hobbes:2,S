Subject: [PATCH 2 of 2] __raw_memcpy_toio32 for x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/11/426

Introduce an x86_64-specific __raw_memcpy_toio32 routine.  This is
measurably faster than the generic version in lib/raw_memcpy_io.c.
Signed-off-by: Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@pathscale.com>
