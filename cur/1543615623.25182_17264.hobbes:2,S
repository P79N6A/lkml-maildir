Thinking -long term- here, I wonder what a good solution for glibc would
be?  Userspace including glibc should never include kernel headers but I
100% agree we should make it as easy as possible for glibc (and other
libc's) to stay in sync with the kernel<->userspace API.
I am betting glibc does not require as much work to become independent
of kernel headers... it is more work to get all the userspace apps that
reference ioctl structures and constants not using kernel headers.
