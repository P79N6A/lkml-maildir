The data between __smp_alt_start and __smp_alt_end will be released at
boot time in some cases (UP machine, kernel without CPU_HOTPLUG, ...).
Releasing memory works at page granularity only, thats why I added the
alignment.  I think you can't simply drop it.

Hmm, ok, it should work then.  How about adding a comment to make sure
the align after __smp_alt_end doesn't get dropped by accident?
