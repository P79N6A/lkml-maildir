Hi all,
Some time ago I posted about a question about some cleanup of what I 
thought looked like some strange code in the kernel - specifically about 
the sock_rcvlowat() function in linux/include/net/sock.h
static inline int sock_rcvlowat(struct sock *sk, int waitall, int len)
{
         return (waitall ? len : min(sk->rcvlowat, len)) ? : 1;
}
The empty second expression puzzled me. Mark Hahn (amongst many other 
people) pointed out to me that it was a valid gcc extention (thank you), 
but I still found it hard to read and exchanged several emails with Mark 
about how to improve the function. Mark came up with a much more 
readable version that achieves the exact same result and generates just 
as good (if not better) code than the original one-line function - the 
function below:
static inline int sock_rcvlowat(struct sock *sk, int waitall, int len)
{
         int r = len;
         if (!waitall)
                 r = min(sk->rcvlowat, len);
         return max(1,r);
}
I have included a patch below (against 2.4.5pre1) that makes the change 
to the more readable version and would like people on the list to 
consider it as a replacement.
Credit for the code should go 100% to Mark as he wrote it, I'm just 
submitting it to the list since I found it so nice :-)
