Hmm, OK  of the 46 I pull in, it's only xfs causing difficulties at the
moment.  Pre 2.6.24 being declared, we had about 10 fixups, all of which
were trivial except for one or two I got the subsystems to fix.

It's frequently just not possible.  There are a lot of global API
changes that sweep across subsystems.  For instance, I had a trivial
fixup script for scsi and net because of a netlink API change.

Right .. it's really not possible to work without an infrastructure that
does this.

We can't really do this.  We don't work in a utopian my area only
environment.  Almost every release cycle involves dealing with patches
that cross subsystem boundaries.  Often we try to minimise the problems
by taking patches from different subsystems via our trees to keep the
dependencies straight, but it does lead to conflicts.  Most of them are
ones we're aware of, and easily resolvable as the trees go in in the
merge window.  So any infrastructure that builds a unified tree has to
be aware of them too.
