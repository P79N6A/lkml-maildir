I did once come across a hacked box on which 'ls' had been replaced by a
hacked version that would not show file or directory names containing the
letters "sh".  'ps' had been hacked the same way.  Probably not the case
here, but such weirdness does happen in ways that have nothing to do with
the kernel.
