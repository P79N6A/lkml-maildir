I agree: the worst part of version dependency is that it's really hard in 
general to just move one of the components backwards or forwards. 
Something you want to do when breakage occurs, or just because you need to 
figure out some _other_ problem (like doing a kernel bug bisection).
Which is why pretty much _every_ component needs to be backwards 
compatible at least to some degree. Otherwise they'd need to be bundled 
and developed together as one thing.
IOW, the same way it's wrong for the kernel to need new binaries, it's 
wrong for binaries to need a new kernel. It's one reason why we seldom add 
new system calls: they aren't all that useful in any kind of short 
timeframe, because even programs that would _like_ to use them usually 
can't do so for a long time (until they don't have to worry about people 
running old kernels any more).
(Some system calls are easier to add than others - if you can easily 
emulate the new system call semantics with just a slight performance hit, 
you can just have a simple wrapper with a fallback. That doesn't always 
work well - some things are just very hard to emulate efficiently).
