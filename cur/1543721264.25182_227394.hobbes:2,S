In that case you get the HID driver, but you won't get the Input
binding, so the devices will be detected, but won't be accessible by the
common means (keyboard through console, mouse via /dev/input/mice,
etc.). They still will be accessible via HIDDEV, if you enable that.
Enabling HID without either HIDINPUT or HIDDEV is pointless.
