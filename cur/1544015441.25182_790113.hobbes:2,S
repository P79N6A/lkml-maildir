It doesn't seem right to merge someone's patches together, make a very
small change, and then no longer credit them as the author.  Seems like it
defeats the purpose of the SOB lines for tracing the train of custody too.
If someone looks to see where the code came from, it will look like you
wrote it.  Maybe Freescale will say Intel stole our code?  Without the SOB,
what record is there in git that Freescale gave permission to put the code
in the kernel?
I also put some significant effort into writing informative commit
messages, which have been lost.  Along with Grant's acks for my patches.
