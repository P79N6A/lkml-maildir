Try passing -Winline, it will tell you when a function marked inline is not
actually inlined.
Presence of inline keyword is not a guarantee the function will not be
inlined, it is a hint to the compiler.
GCC 3.4 is much bettern than earlier 3.x GCCs in actually inlining functions
marked as inline, but there are still cases when it decides not to inline
for various reasons.  E.g. in C++ world, lots of things are inline, yet
honoring that everywhere would mean very inefficient huge programs.
If a function relies for correctness on being inlined, then it should use
inline __attribute__((always_inline)).
