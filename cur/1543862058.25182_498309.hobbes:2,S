That's a possible but time intensive approach for this kind of bug.
I'd expect bisecting such an "at least 1 times a day" bug to take at 
about one month.
And that's not a high number, that's a realistic estimate considering 
that you have to test a dozen kernels and verifying that a kernel is 
good takes 2-3 days.
