Could someone please explain how the kernel works? Having just studied
some of the algorithms used in OS design as part of my CS course, I
thought it might be nice to see how some of them are actually implemented.
While the sources are fine, the comments lack the depth (IMHO) necessary
to get a kernel newbie up to speed without the help of a friendly
neighbourhood guru. Some questions from off the top of my head that other
students (and other people) may ask:
 * I can see that there are a number of queues used for scheduling, one of
which uses a round robin scheme. How many are there? What algorithms are
used? Why were they selected over other choices? How does the SMP code
affect these algorithms?
 * Memory management? How is it made to be architecture independent? How
does it deal with fragmentation? And swap space? How does the kernel add
new modules? And release them? (Not really a mm question, that....)
 * Filing systems. How does the VFS work?
Yes, I know that some of these questions might have obvious answers, and I
know that some obvious questions haven't been asked, but I guess you get
the gist of what is being said....
As an aside, one of the reasons why NT 4 is less stable than NT 3 is
because the video drivers are not run in user space and more. Surely the
integration of the fb into the i386 versions of Linux will cause similar
problems? Or have I missed something?
Cheers,
Simon
