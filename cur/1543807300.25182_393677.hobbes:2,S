I think you snipped too much of the description.  This was after the  
part you quoted:

This seems to indicate that this is a _client_ for a IEEE1394 memory  
device, as opposed to a server.  Perhaps the description should be  
clarified, but I don't see any security issues (the kernel does not  
expose its own memory, it accesses the memory that another device is  
exposing).

There is no way to make Linux robust with unreliable memory  
subsystems, sorry.  It would be like trying to make a human more  
robust with an unreliable O2 supply. Memory just has to work.
