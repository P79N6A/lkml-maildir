Use case please?  What will this info be used for, other than for
feedback for humans about the state of the propagation tree?
Face it, userspace is inherently racy.  Inode numbers, device numbers,
whatever are being reused all the time, we live with it, even if it's
programs, and not just humans.
But it's not even an important design decision, the ID allocation can
be swapped at any time.  If you insist, I'll change it to a 64bit
counter, and it'll just suck a little more, but no permanent damage
done ;)
