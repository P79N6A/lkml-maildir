Fortuntely, it doesn't need to be atomic.  This got me too, but Paul
Mackerras convinced me.
We don't care if someone decrements it between us checking < 0 and
doing the atomic_dec_and_test.  So the only thing we worry about is
the "up" case.  A userspace "up" will go into the kernel (since count
< 0), and the kernel "up" will wake us since we are on the queue
before we do this test.

Damn, I was hoping to find out which arch actually is going to use
this.  I hate untested code.
Thanks!
