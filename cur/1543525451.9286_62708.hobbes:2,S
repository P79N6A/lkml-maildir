   2) Dave (or anyone for that matter) - is the qlogicisp driver in the 2.3.43 tree
   supposed to work correctly?  Or am I supposed to grab the one from the vger CVS
   tree?
It should work fine, the one in 2.3.4x current matches vger exactly.
I will do some studying and testing on my UltraSparc PCI systems here
just to double check everything.  If I find something I'll send you
fixes.
Later,
