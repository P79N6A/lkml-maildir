The problem point is "local apic" - my usual kernel has it, but
.config-minimal does not have it. When I enable local apic in the
minimal kernel (see attached .config), it does not suspend any longer.
When I disable local apic in my "normal" kernel, it suspends.
However, whatever i do, it does not resume properly when i wake the
computer up after suspend (see my last article).
So, local APIC (I have to admit that I don't know what that is, is
there some global APIC as well...?) seems to have some bugs.
Workaround for me: disable local APIC.
However, I'd appreciate if someone had any idea why the kernel crashes
when trying to resume. Deadlocks...?
