I didn't say he didn't try to do right.  I didn't mean to come off terse,
I was just informing Yitzchak of the etiquette of this list. I even tried
to soften it with the "how to spell a word" comment.
So Yitzchak, if I offended you, I'm sorry and I didn't mean to do it.
Nick, FYI, Don't parse the CC list. That may be acceptible on other
mailing lists, but the volume of mail on this one, we request that the CC
list remains unless someone asks to be taken off. I only saw this mail
because Yitzchak referenced you in his reply. ;-)
