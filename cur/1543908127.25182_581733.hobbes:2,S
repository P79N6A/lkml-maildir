No, they are still returning data encoded in the consolemap.
What was happening before is that the diacr variable wasn't always
encoded in latin1, it was encoded in the consolemap. Now diacr is always
unicode, so the diacritical translations now have to be translated into
consolemap for the old ioctl() to work as before.
