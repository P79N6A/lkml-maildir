I mean that this code violates the rule that you may modify a value
only once between two sequence points. Newer gccs have a warning for
this (-Wsequence-point), the info page tells more.
Also, did I understand it right that you want to use fls even on
architectures that don't have it as a builtin? I would guess that will
actually be noticeably slower, since generic_fls is so complicated.
