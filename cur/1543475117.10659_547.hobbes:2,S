it fails cdrom_mode_sense silently; I had to turn on all the error
messages to get something out of it (underrun if I remember correctly; I
don't have the system in front of me here..)
So, in ide_cdrom_probe_capabilities, there's a do loop (close to the
begining of the function), that if the # of attempts to get sense data
<= 0, it just plain returns.  Well, this drive tickles that, so it still
works as stated, but all other features are disabled (even though they
work..)  I think at least, it should say something HERE, that the drive
failed trying to get the sense data...
Not sure what the drive's problem is; it works for eject/audio/door
locking under 2.0.35; but none of the above works with 2.2.x (last
checked with 2.2.2pre1, w/AC2)
