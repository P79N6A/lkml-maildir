Maybe 5% less useful or so.  There are reasons we move other
(non-controversial) docs into the kernel source.  100% of these docs can
be URLs.

This is a silly argument that dean gaudet dismembered.  It's 12K
compressed and not your main argument at all.

I agree.
So, I believe points #1 and #2 are silly, and #3 is your core argument.
And I agree that it would show sensitivity towards those people who
dislike the BK license.
That said, I still think removing the doc is a hideously wrong thing
to do.  I see the action of BK doc removal as encouraging some strict
notion of what we can and cannot discuss, inside the kernel sources.
_That_ is the free speech aspect.
I see enforcing a strict notion of acceptable speech in the kernel
sources as a very bad thing for the Linux project.
I'm not asking you to agree -- but do you even understand my viewpoint here?

First, I can host the doc.  And will, if there is justification.
I do not see a justification.  Larry is irrelevant.
Second, I guarantee that license-related complaints about BitKeeper will
continue to exist, regardless of the doc's location.  Moving the doc
does absolutely nothing to assauge bad feelings about the BK license.
