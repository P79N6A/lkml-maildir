Hi,
ACPI provides many functionalities for physical devices. Such as for
suspend/resume, ACPI can tell us correct devices D-state for S3. There
are tons of devices enhancement for both realtime and boot time from
ACPI. To utilize ACPI, physical devices like PCI devices must know its
partner. The patches try to do this. After this is done, we can enhance
many features, such as improve suspend/resume.
These patches are against 2.6.10-rc1, please give your comments.
Thanks,
Shaohua
