I've already pointed out to Jon the problems with this approach on
numerous occasions and to be honest do not have the time to do so
again,
I will not accept patches to make DRM drivers rely on fbdev drivers in
the kernel for many many many reasons, two quick ones :
a) we don't always have a fully functional fbdev driver, see intel fb drivers.
b) loading fbdev drivers breaks X in a lot of cases, we need to be a
bit more careful.
c) Lots of distros don't use fbdev drivers, forcing this on them to
use drm isn't an option.
should I go on?
I've made suggestions I've given you patches that start the work, I'm
going to finish that work, but I've no timeline, I'd hope at KS/OLS
this year to do it..
Dave.
