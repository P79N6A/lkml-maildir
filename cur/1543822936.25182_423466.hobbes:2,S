No, it's executable. This is what makes executable shell scripts
distinct from feeding the file to an interpreter.
From 
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part4/section-7.html
:
      The script is called `executable' because just like a real
      (binary) executable it starts with a so-called `magic number'
      indicating the type of the executable.  In our case this number is
      `#!' and the OS takes the rest of the first line as the
      interpreter for the script, possibly followed by 1 initial option
      like:
        #!/bin/sed -f
      Suppose this script is called `foo' and is found in /bin,
      then if you type:
        foo arg1 arg2 arg3
      the OS will rearrange things as though you had typed:
        /bin/sed -f /bin/foo arg1 arg2 arg3
      There is one difference though: if the setuid permission bit for
      `foo' is set, it will be honored in the first form of the
      command; if you really type the second form, the OS will honor
      the permission bits of /bin/sed, which is not setuid, of course.
