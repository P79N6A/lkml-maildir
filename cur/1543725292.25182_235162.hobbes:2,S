After running a session for a long period of time, I was going to
shutdown my machine, when I went to shutdown:
Kernel 2.6.7 crashed w/ VMWare 4.5.2.
I could not copy/paste text because it had crashed at the time, so here
is a screenshot:

Any idea what happened here?
Incase someone thinks it's the RAM, I ran memtest86 3.1a for 3+ days and
it came up with no errors.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
