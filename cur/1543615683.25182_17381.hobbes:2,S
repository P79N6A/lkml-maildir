I'm not sure if CSE is run before or after inlining, but it
is probably not wise to leave it up to the compiler.

A couple of other private responses pointed this out, and also had
suggestions for several ways to avoid the thundering herds. I am not
sure it's possible to honor exclusive wakeup requests here without
creating problems or otherwise having to propagate semantic changes
further up the call chain. I think that comment and one of the others
needs to be expanded to make the exclusive wakeup issue clearer.
Also there is a bug in the hash function (pointed out by an anonymous
private response):

which is easy enough to repair with a conditional definition of
GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME.
The same person also mentioned that less work could be done in
the hash function by storing the shift amount directly in the zone,
and also pointed out that the masking operation is unnecessary as the
shift already annihilates the high-order bits.
