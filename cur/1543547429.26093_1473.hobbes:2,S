Not quite, the gdb stub uses an private polled serial driver. The only
hook into the serial driver is very early into the interrupt to tap the
break char. As long as you debug the serial driver on a different UART
than the stub it should work fine.

That remains to be seen. Complex locking does not necessarily look like
the true path to performance.
