Ok, disregard most of my last e-mail.  It is fine to decouple the flush 
from the update, as long as they stay close enough that you can reason 
they happen together.  I guess I hadn't seen the other parts of the 
patch which release the page table spinlock in between the two, and 
somehow missed it again when responding to the above as I got too 
excited explaining why the decoupling is ok.  It is not ok to release 
the spinlock when using shadow page tables on SMP.  There are some 
rather complex races that can result.  Here's one case:
 CPU-0                    CPU-1
-----------------------  ---------------------------
test_and_clear_dirty(x)
spin_unlock(ptl)
                         write address mapped by X
                         (harware updates dirty bit)
                         spin_lock(ptl)
                         set_pte_wrprotect(x)
                         flush
flush
Now, the write protected pte which maps a dirty page gets broken in two 
ways; it is unclear if dirty bit or entiry PTE from CPU-0 is deferred 
until flush, so either write protected PTE for modified page loses the 
dirty bit (BAD!), or write protected PTE loses both dirty and write 
protect bits (VERY BAD!).
To prevent this, we need a flush before dropping the spinlock.  If that 
gets too complicated, we can drop the defer logic and just use 
pte_update instead, which notifies the hypervisor immediately of the 
mapping change.
