Hello there,
Not a while ago I have upgraded from Kernel 2.4.9 to 2.4.10 and I noticed 2 
strange things:
After I am done with the compilation and I am setting my lilo to load the 
new kernel, and then I am booting the machine
my machine gets stuck at boot time (before the init gets into action). this 
problem does NOT happen once I reboot the machine again and the kernel 
loads up straight with no problems, I then had to change a few things in 
the kernel's configuration (Tried playing with the APM a bit to see how 
come it's not working for me (I'll get to the apm issue soon...)) and I 
noticed that again - My machine gets stucked at boot time. Another reboot 
and that's it - works like a charm...
I played with it some more and I found out this:
Every fresh kernel I am running for the first time gets my machine freeze, 
after another boot everything is working well.
Please tell me what other information you need - I'll supply it (Please cc 
to me as well and not just the mailing list since I am not registered in 
the majordomo due to a serious bandwidth problems...)
Another issue is an APM problem on my Dell Latitude C600 laptop (The same 
machine with the 2.4.10 boot problems... which runs slack8 b.t.w.)
I can't suspend it, it gives a note stating "apm: Resource temporarily 
unavailable"...
I've attached an strace of the command and my kernel configuration.
Thanks in advance.
