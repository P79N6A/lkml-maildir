I was wondering what the status and possability/opinions of a zero copy sendfile 
routine where.  As I see it, the zero copy sendfile could be implemented a 
couple of ways, but I did not know if this was in the works by other groups or 
if a strategy had been in place to implement this feature and not yet done.
