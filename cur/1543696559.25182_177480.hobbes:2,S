I see that recent 2.4 has crypto. Is there a version of the tools which
will do cryptoloop using the kernel as released? I tried the old 2.4
version I had, and the latest version which works with 2.6, neither
worked to do an losetup.
Yes, I know about the add-in support, I'm just wondering if the recent
kernel. say 2.4.22-ac4, has the capability if I ask it nicely. I'd like
to share data already in use with aes under 2.6.0-testX.
