Definitely -- a lot of these patches are purely a result of gcc's shoddy
inadequacies. I do intend filing reports with gcc, however ...

My experience (regarding gcc's diligence in dealing with bug reports) has
been otherwise :-)
Anyway, I once had a _very_ similar discussion with Andrew (regarding some
other gcc bug) previously, and the (completely correct) point he made was
that: firstly, there's no guarantee they'll get this sorted out asap, and
even if they did, we'll still not be dropping support for older gcc
versions anyway ...
