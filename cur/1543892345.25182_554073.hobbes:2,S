Yes, this is the patch. It would be hard to break up in pieces.
The reason it is big is because it has to remove the older IA-64-only
implementation which was all in a single file whose size
was bigger than 100kB. It is hard to break this, unless I explicitely
remove the 'remove old file' diff from the patch.

I must be missing something here. I am modifying the address of task * in
the function. This is my second return value.
int pfm_get_task(void **p)
{
        *p = 0x1000;
	return 0;
}
int main(void)
{
        void *p;
        p = 0x2000;
        printf("p=%p\n", p);
        pfm_get_task(&p);
        printf("p=%p\n", p);
        return 0;
}
I am not passing a pointer to an array of struct ask *, but merely the address of a pointer
to struct task *.

The function using this is a system call, so it is not too deep in the call stack
and then the perfmon function never go very deep.

Very good thanks. I still need to go through all your other comments.
