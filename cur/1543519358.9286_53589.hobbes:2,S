Could you tell me about the other known bugs privately? I don't care at
all about minor issues or new device drivers. If somebody wants more
feature or 2.0.x happens to be unstable he should upgrade to 2.2.x. I only
care about installed systems that if are running 2.0.x it means 2.0.x is
rock solid for them. In such envinronment only a security issue can
generate troubles. So I think I can care about security issues in the most
important subsystems (of the order of the ping -R crash at least) to not
force admin to upgrade to 2.2.x due security exploits. They should upgrade
ASAP though (2.0.x security fixes have low priority).
