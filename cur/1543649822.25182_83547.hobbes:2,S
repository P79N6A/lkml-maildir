This board is not very big.
Biggest chip has this printed on:
adaptec
AIC-7770P
EQEA440
711211
A48061.1
KOREA
Second big chip has a rather uninformative sticker with letters "PD2U"
slapped on so I can't see what is printed on chip :(
This text is printed on the back side of the board:
"(c) OLIVETTI,1994 G0622C COD.794126L /00 B-S-C4
There is a barcode printed on a side, do you need it? :)
Also I see at least 3 SCSI connectors. One on a side, accessible
from the rear of the box when board sits in EISA slot.
Two connectors are on the top side (opposite to EISA bus connector).
And I see something like 2 more SCSI connectors right
on the board surface.
This box is accompanied with configuration diskettes, I'll send 'em
to you off-list.
