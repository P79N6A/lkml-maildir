This code would not exist in the kernel, the kernel cannot dereference
stp->u.  The stp->u dereference would silently work on x86 and x86_64
but it would generate an exception on sparc64 and other platforms.
User space accesses must go through the proper copy_from_user(),
copy_to_user, get_user(), and put_user() interfaces.
It must first copy stp into a local kernel space copy, then it may
inspect the value of stp->u.
And yes sparse would catch this problem in your code, because the
"__user" annotations would catch the illegal "stp->u" dereference.
