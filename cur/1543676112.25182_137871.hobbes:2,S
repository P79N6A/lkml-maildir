I'm using a dell powerall web 120 with scsi drives installed
Using redhat 7.2 with the 2.4.18-19.7.x kernel installed 
And when using badblocks on the swap partition I get
Attempt to access beyond end of device
08:06: rw=0, want=1044196, limit=1044193
1044192
done
Pass completed, 1 bad blocks found.
And fdisk reports there to be 1044193+ blocks in the partition ?
I wish to be personally CC'ed any answer / comments..  
Thanks a million
