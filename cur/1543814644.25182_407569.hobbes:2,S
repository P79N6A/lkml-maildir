really? I can test that easily enough if nothing else :)

Well Its cheep enough to get another cable and test that. But as the
failure is repeatable in nearly (but not quite) down to the block for
a given build then i don't have so much hope.

It being the weekend here i don't now have access to the box... but
from the rhn page (linked in the bugzilla entry if anyone can follow
that) it says
Ata Maxtor 6Y080M0  SCSI  sda 0
Ata Maxtor 6V250F0   SCSI  sdb 0
I thought they had a ide (normal ata) cddrive on board as well but
cant see that on the hardware info page...
I will check on Monday and report back.
Since posting this i have tried one more thing
I had a look at the data sheet for the sata control er and it said
that it supported the SATA 1 (150) mode  and the drive supports SATA 2
(300) i think (names maybe confused here).
So I tried moving the jumper on the drive to the 150 mode position but
this made no difference.
Could the drive have some functions (NCQ?) enabled by default that the
controller cant handle? (and we dont turn off when we initialise the
drive as we have no support yet?)... ok that's reaching...
Any ideas of what I can check or tryout would be great!
Thanks
Samuel
ps Mauro, yep I am quite convinced we are seeing the same thing
here... I will let you know how it turns out for us
