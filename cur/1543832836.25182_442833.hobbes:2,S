I tried changing it to a per tty spinlock. Now I know that the code
relies on the BKL being broken when a task sleeps. That's a part of
the BKL I don't like, unlocks are happening implicitly instead of
explicitly. I always wonder if the code should have reacquired the BKL
when it woke up. In this case the sleep happens inside the line
discipline read functions.
Now I'm wondering if read and write should have taken BKL to begin
with. Read sleeps in a loop so after the first pass it has lost the
BKL. Read and write also have the own locking code internally.
