I don't think cpusets needs to grow beyond what it contains now. The
discussion started as an API discussion. Cpusets requirements, current
API and usage models were clearly shown. According to Hubertus CKRM
will be able to deal with these and implement them in its own API. It
isn't today. So why not wait for that? Having two APIs for the same
thing isn't unusual. Whether we switch from affinity to sched_domains
underneath isn't really the question.

ISVs are already using the current cpusets API. I think of resource
management systems like PBS (Altair), LSF (Platform Computing) plus
several providers of industrial simulation codes in the area of CAE
(computer aided engineering). I know examples from static and dynamic
mechanical stress analysis, fluid dynamics and electromagnetics
simulations. Financial simulation software could benefit of such
stuff, too, but I don't know of any example. Anyhow, I'd say we
already have a business case here. And instead of pushing ISVs to
support the SGI way of doing this, the Bull way and the NEC way, it
makes more sense to ask them to support the LINUX way.
