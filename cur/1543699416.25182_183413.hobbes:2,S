TSO can be enabled while NAT is running so you better do this in the 
packet flow or if there is a suitable notifier hook that can be used.
Most firewalls etc load the ruleset before activating the 
interfaces, i..e before even loading the nic drivers, so there is no 
interfaces to look at when iptables_nat is loaded.
