Other than the hackbench lock latency that Ingo believes is quite
important (and I wouldn't disagree at all if it turns out to be a
regression), I have not had much time to test things out. I don't
think we can chance it in the SUSE kernel.
The other thing is that it causes headaches when trying to analyse
and review proposed scheduler changes (eg. Suresh's power saving
work).
