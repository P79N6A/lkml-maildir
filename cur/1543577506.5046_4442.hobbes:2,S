just a heads up that usb in smp-enabled 2.4.0 kernels running on
machines with the via apollo pro 133a chipset is still broken.  the last
word i heard was that it's a pci irq routing problem.  smp and usb will
play together pretty nicely if you disable apic (ie. "noapic" to lilo).
i'm more than willing to help test patches and provide any more info to
people working on this, but i lack the low-level knowledge to actually
fix it.
thanks,
pete
