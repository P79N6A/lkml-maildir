I'm looking for anyone that has merged the international crypto patches
with Red Hat kernel rpm's.  
I've basically gotten the patch to apply cleanly, but then the build
completely fails during module building.  I don't have the know how to fix
things.
Thanks for any information.
I'm currently using H.J. Lu's rpm's from:

Thanks
