Hi Alan !
I'm trying to get some sense out of the above report as it seem to match
a problem a user reported me as well. It's interesting because it's
apparently running UP, so it's not the SMP race found by Ross. It's
definitely a problem with shared interrupt though.
I've followed the code path involved here. Basically, we had
ide_dma_intr() called while the drive was busy. This is strange for a
simple reason: Even if we got the wrong interrupt (shared interrupt),
__ide_dma_test_irq() should have returned 0, and so ide_dma_intr
shouldn't have been called.
Assuming the driver was doing basic read/write operations, I checked
the code, and while it seems that do_rw_disk() is called without
the lock held nor interrupts masked, I see no obvious race.
drive->waiting_for_dma is set before setting up the handler and
issuing the command, and while the DMA engine is indeed started
only after sending the command, it's INTR bit have been cleared
previously (I suppose it can't be stale, or can it while the DMA
haven't been started yet ? In this case we would need to take
the lock here).
> Results are that the drive itself just hangs and has to be powered off (resetting the box does not work). The drives worked (and works) fine in non shared-interrupt context. Controller is:
