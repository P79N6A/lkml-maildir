He has seen it.  I'm currently soliciting feedback on the linux-kbuild
list; I'll let Michael decide when the patch is mature enough to feed
to Linus.  So far Jakub has checked in saying the sparc{,64} changes
look OK at a glance, but as far as I know the patch hasn't been
actually *tested* on anything but i386.  I'll try and verify RSN that
the various ppc boot formats work (or at least that they seem to
compile normally).
I did a new version this morning -- against 2.3.23 and with a couple
fixes.  It too is in
