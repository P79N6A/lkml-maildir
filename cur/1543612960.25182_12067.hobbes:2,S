Thanks, that was quick! :)

I don't think they do, aside from that LAST-ACK is a synchronized state.
I.e., if you set RCV.WND to zero after receiving a FIN, any subsequent
out-of-window (below or above) segment will be acked. However, I don't
think it matters much, since above-window packets would in this case
always be caused by a bug in the sender.
