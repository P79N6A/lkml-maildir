Not sure where he got his %esp, but I extracted the following:
<zwane> MAXMEM=0x33e00000
<zwane> vmalloc: start = 0xf3e1f000, end = 0xfbe21000
<zwane> fixaddr: start = 0xfbe23000, end = 0xfffff000
which means somehow %esp landed in an unmapped tidbit in the middle of
of vmallocspace that isn't even mapped. I highly suspect rounding
errors of mine since I squished vmallocspace, fixmapspace, and the
physical mapping so close together they might share L3 pagetables, i.e.
they're separated by 2*MMUPAGE_SIZE instead of customary 8MB or so.
