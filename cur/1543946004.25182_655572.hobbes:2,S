Subject: very poor ext3 write performance on big filesystems?

I have a 1.2 TB (of which 750 GB is used) filesystem which holds
almost 200 millions of files.
1.2 TB doesn't make this filesystem that big, but 200 millions of files 
is a decent number.
Most of the files are hardlinked multiple times, some of them are
hardlinked thousands of times.
Recently I began removing some of unneeded files (or hardlinks) and to 
my surprise, it takes longer than I initially expected.
After cache is emptied (echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches) I can usually 
remove about 50000-200000 files with moderate performance. I see up to 
5000 kB read/write from/to the disk, wa reported by top is usually 20-70%.
After that, waiting for IO grows to 99%, and disk write speed is down to 
50 kB/s - 200 kB/s (fifty - two hundred kilobytes/s).
Is it normal to expect the write speed go down to only few dozens of 
kilobytes/s? Is it because of that many seeks? Can it be somehow 
optimized? The machine has loads of free memory, perhaps it could be 
uses better?
Also, writing big files is very slow - it takes more than 4 minutes to 
write and sync a 655 MB file (so, a little bit more than 1 MB/s) - 
fragmentation perhaps?
