there's one material difference we just found: in the !hres case we'll 
do the timer IRQ handling mostly from the lapic vector - while in 
mainline we do it from the irq0 vector. So, how does your 
/proc/interrupts look like? How frequently does LOC increase, and how 
frequently does IRQ 0 increase?
(meanwhile we'll fix and restore things so that it matches mainline 
behavior.)
