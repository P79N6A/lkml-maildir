Not that it matters now, as we're messing with other variations,
but I notice that the above is (1) better looking than having an
#ifdef, (2) better than being broken in the NUMA yes, CPUSETS no,
config, but (3) burdens this code with another nodemask and
nodes_and() op, even in the case that CPUSETS are not configured.
