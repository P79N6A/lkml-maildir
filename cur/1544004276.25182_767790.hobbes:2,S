Subject: [PATCH] DOC: add min_addr, fix max_addr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/11/432

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
Add "min_addr" documentation.
For "max_addr", add nn before [KMG] since a number is needed and this
is consistent with other uses of [KMG].
