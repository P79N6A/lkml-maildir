The CVS tree there contains the new 0.4 SBLive! driver, but also seems
to contain a 0.9 driver for Creative's dxr2 DVD board - did I miss all
the shining lights and blaring sirens about that one?!
Three cheers for Creative, now we just need to club together to buy
Alan an SBLive so he can whip up some finished drivers in a couple of
weeks ;)
More seriously, will the SBLive driver be making an appearance in the
kernel anytime soon? It's all properly GPL'd now so it should go in
easily.
