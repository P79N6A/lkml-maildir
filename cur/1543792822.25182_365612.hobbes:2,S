You already have fchown(2) and fchmod(2), that's covered.
I'm interested in openat(2) for the race-free implications.  I've been 
working on a race-free coreutils replacement[1], targetted mainly at 
Linux.  Being able to key an operation off of an open file descriptor 
eliminates the few remaining races inherent in the Linux filesystem ABI.
The remaining race cases are all cases where the the syscall takes a 
pathname, when it really should take a pathname and an fd.
