Set the vma flag when we locked it and then skip when we find it locked 
right? This would be in addition to the global lock?
stop-machine would work for KVM since its a once in a Guest OS time of 
thing. But GRU, KVM and eventually Infiniband need the ability to attach 
in a reasonable timeframe without causing major hiccups for other 
processes.

We sure have enough flags.
