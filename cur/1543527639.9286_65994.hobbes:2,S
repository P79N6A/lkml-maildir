Hi All, 
I'm having some trouble with one of the newer developement 
kernels (2.3.46) and support of the Ontream DI-30 tape 
drives.  
Whenever I try to "mt erase" or "mt eject" I get this 
in the syslog:
Feb 26 23:41:03 dream kernel: ide-tape: Reached idetape_chrdev_open
Feb 26 23:41:44 dream kernel: hdd : bad access: block=5, count=1
...
Feb 26 23:41:48 dream kernel: ide-tape: ht0: invalid header
identification string
Feb 26 23:41:48 dream kernel: ide-tape: ht0: failed to find valid ADRL
header
and when I try tar:
dream:/home/eric # tar -c --record-size=32768 -f /dev/tape .
tar: Cannot write to /dev/tape: Input/output error
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Some sanity checks:
* Tape drive has latest ROM upgrade
     "ide-tape: hdd <-> ht0: OnStream DI-30 rev 1.06"
* tar block size is 32k
* Cartridge loaded, door closed, write-protect
  tab set to "Unlocked", Checked all cables
* ide-tape.c Version 1.16f
* /dev/tape symlinked to /dev/ht0
here are the particulars of the system:
PentiumII-350mhz, 64Mb RAM (SMP - 2 CPUs)
DI-30 running on Primary IDE/Slave
Kernel version 2.3.46
I've tried compiling the kernel without SMP and removing 
one of the CPUs, and I've tried the newest kernels 2.3.47 
and .48 to no avail.
Hey Gabi and Andre - If you need any more info about this, 
just say the word, and you shall be deluged with all the 
information you can handle...  :-)
