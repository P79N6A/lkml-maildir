Interestingly, noirq didn't actually help. The main difference seems to
be that DMA is not automatically enabled for my drives with the 2.6.14
kernel, and I'm getting permission denied errors when trying to enable
it with hdparm.
Seems like piix is coming up too late and the ide device is already
claimed by a generic driver that doesn't do dma. I'm building ide/piix
into the kernel now to see if that helps.
