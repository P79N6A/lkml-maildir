Hi,
Apologies if this is a stupid question or I'm asking the wrong people, but
in trying to include sys/resource.h I found that bits/resource.h trys to
include asm/resource.h, which doesn't exist, and that this happens for
everything else in include. This can be fixed by symlinking
linux/include/asm-i386 to linux/include/asm, but could anyone shed some
light on why this isn't done when building the kernel?
(2.2.11 with the tcp patches on a once RedHat 6.0 intel box)
Cheers,
Andy
