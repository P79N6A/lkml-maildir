Subject: [Patch 10/10] dm: drop BIO_SEG_VALID bit

I just noticed that bio_clone copies the BIO_SEG_VALID bit from the
original bio when it was set. When we modify bi_idx or bi_vcnt
afterwards the segment counts are invalid and the bit must be dropped
(though it is fairly unlikely that it has already been set).
