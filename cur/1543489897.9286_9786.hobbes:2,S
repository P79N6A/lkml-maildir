For inodes, yes. 
For other things, no.
And it makes allocating inode pages a riskier thing - although for inodes
we almost always do have the option of just trying to free up something
else, so there a "soft" allocator may well be completely acceptable.

I don't thik we want to go quite that aggressively up to 32 pages, it's
just too likely to fail.  Going to 2 or 4 is probably fine (just 2 pages
is enough to guarantee that there is no 2-page fragmentation, which is all
that forking cares about, and is safer if you worry about making sure you
can sometimes get new inodes). 
Want to try it and see? It should be trivial to change the inode code to
allocate 2 or four pages at a time (two constants need to change).
