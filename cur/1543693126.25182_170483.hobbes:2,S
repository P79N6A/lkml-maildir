Hello.
I was using menuconfig to check out 2.6.0-test6-bk6, when I found that
  the cs4281 ALSA driver had disappeared.
Is this intentional, did I screw something up, or is it accidental?
Thanks!
-Joseph

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive?
