Folks, what is this code doing in a security module?
The check for unauthorized files should really move into
flush_old_files, removing the horrible devnull hack at the same time.
The tty loop isn't in the right place either, and it seems we might
be missing a call to disassociate_tty if the current process is the
session leader.  I'd suggest moving this code into fs/exec.c aswell,
aksing the security module for the actual permissions through an LSM
hook.
