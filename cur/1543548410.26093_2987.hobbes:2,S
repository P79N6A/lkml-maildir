If you can get me a tarball of the CVS repository, I'll import the
history into a BK tree and then we can do side by side tests.  I know
Mitchell Baker somewhat, so if she is still there, you might ping her.
I'd be interested to see this as well, so please let me know if the
CVS tarball is available.  Just to be clear, I am not talking about the
results of a CVS checkout, I am talking about the actual CVS tree with
the RCS files - if I just imported the most recent versions, BK would
be unfairly faster because it would be storing a lot less history.
