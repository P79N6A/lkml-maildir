No, that's ok, and that's supported with the current config scripts.
The original question was about having the generic code built in, but
the socket driver (yenta) as a module.  The socket driver needs to be
loaded regardless of what cards you're using.  So I think having one
in the kernel and the other as a module is of limited utility.
