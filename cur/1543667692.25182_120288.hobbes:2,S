Subject: [PATCH] Fix Alpha cond_syscall
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Richard,
The recent changes in CONFIG_NET=n handling have broken cond_syscall
implementation on Alpha, since some functions prototypes are visible
in kernel/sys.c, while cond_syscall defines them as x(void).
I used the same method as the other platforms to get rid of the
problem, and added a comment found in asm-v850/unistd.h explaining the
problem.
I'm currently running 2.5.66 with this patch on the Jensen without
problems.
Thanks,
        M.
