Twould appear that our mindsets are not in harmony.

Oh, CXFS made mistakes, but I don't think this is one of them.
But it appears we have sufficient fundimental differences that
we'd agree on much of the list.

This is a fun Friday afternoon exercise:
- SELinux server, Smack client:
Client sends "MyDogHasNoNose" to server.
Server determines that is not a value secctx as far as it knows
returns appropriate error.
Client sends "sysadm_t:so,c1,2" (some understood SELinux context) to server.
Server makes access check, goes ahead, even though the meaning of
the secctx may be unrelated.
On file creation, the file may get a secctx that the client would
not expect. Client would deny access unless the client has a rule
allowing that access.
- Smack server, SELinux client:
Client sends "sysadm_t:so,c1,2" to the server. Access checks are
made with that string. New files will get created with that label.
So long as there's a directory into which a process with that label
can write it should work with Smack semantics.
- So ...
Either could be made to function somewhat if the Smack rules
and labels got set properly. I can't claim to say that you
couldn't set up the SELinux side to accomodate the Smack labels,
but I don't think it would be easy if you can.
I think it would be a really really bad idea for anyone to
try this without both Stephen and me in the room. Dave should
be there too, so he can watch if the atmosphere catches fire.
I think that the general answer is that it wouldn't work,
but with the fate of the universe at stake and a big budget
hollywood production you could make something limp along.
