Just patched 2.4.18 first into 2.4.19-pre3 and direct into 2.4.19-pre3-ac1.
Couldn't get compile through because of error /linux/drivers/md/md.c.
Looked and found patch for 2.5.6 series kernel and used it...Now compile
succeeded.
I'm not sure if bug is in pre3 or pre3-ac1,but I'm sure it's not in 2.4.18,I 
got that compiled without any errors.
So just wanted to notify...
