Ah, I didn't look at where the loop is used and didn't think there'd
be _two_ get_user() calls in the fast case.  Not my instinct.

Yours has a couple of problems.
   1. It'll make futex waits somewhat slower.  One of the nicer features
      of 2.6 futexes is that we got rid of the explicit page table lookup.
   2. It's broken because a page can be paged out by another thread
      after you've forced it in and before the get_user().  We only
      take mmap_sem, not the page table lock.
