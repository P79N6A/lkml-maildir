   Does that still retain the protection for ISA DMA? We need two separate DMA 
   limits - one for ISA, one for PCI32. They must both exist at the same time.
Right, but my suggestion at it's core will get a working system
quickly, making it work in ISA + PCI environments is just the devil in
the details...
