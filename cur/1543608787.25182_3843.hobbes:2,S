If you don't mind having your Web-Server with 1000 connections/second
be a "single user", just scan for all the unique UID/GID pairs.
All the root processes are one "user", the lpd is another user,
Apache is another user, login-joe is another user, etc. The total
number of tasks is the number of directories that represent digits
in /proc.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
