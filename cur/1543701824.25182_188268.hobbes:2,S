It's worse than that.  You can do
     mknod fred b maj minor
anywhere on any UNIX filesystem and expect it to a) work and b) refer
to the same device for all time until it is removed. However, this
doesn't appear to be guaranteed by SUS -- the only guarantees are that
the dev_t returned from the stat() family of calls is unique within a LAN.
I know that Linux already breaks this (the stupid /dev/sg[0-9] that
depend not on the SCSI bus and lun but on the order they're detected,
for example)
