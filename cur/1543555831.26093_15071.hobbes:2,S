Nice to learn.

Well, it's one of these root-only admin tools.
I assume, root knows about what (s)he's doing.
So, I'll add some line to the documentation that tells you not to run the
scripts in parallel. Locking is really overkill, IMHO.

Well, the default for tmscsim is 1.5s time after a reset before it start
command processing again. This can be changed by echoing DelayReset values tp
the proc file. If your Plextor requires 5s, just do 
echo "delayreset 5" >/proc/scsi/tmscsim/? and the driver will wait for 5.5s
