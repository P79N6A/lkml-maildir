Those are ones that Andrew's patch should fix nicely. You might need a
decent VM as well though.
The fun below 1mS comes from
	1.	APM bios calls where the bios decides to take >1mS to have
		a chat with your batteries
	2.	Video cards pulling borderline legal PCI tricks to get
		better benchmarketing by stalling the entire bus

For video conferencing and for real world audio mixing you can't use
that 250ms. Not even for games. If your audio is 150mS late in quake you
will notice it, really notice it. And the buffers on the audio card are
btw generally in RAM not the fifo on the chip, so they dont help when the
PCI bus loads up

Umm no USB audio is rather good. USB sends isosynchronous, time guaranteed
sample streams down the USB bus, to the speakers where the A to D is clear
of the machine proper.

You'll see those too. Pure playback is ok because you have to buffer
equally rather than reliably hit deadlines
