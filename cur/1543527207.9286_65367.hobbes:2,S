actually somebody updated the code a few months ago. it used to be
broken for newer gccs (wrong asm constraints). i have that patch
marked 2-look-at, but i think it also went into 2.3 later.
the other issue is that some of the functions are huge, it's unobvious
that inlining them is a good idea, and apparetnly there are some
doubts wrt their correctness.

i saw this problem for functions that depended on builtin_conctant_p()
and called gcc builtins when it returned was true. i don't think this is
happening in 2.3 now, so it might be just a missing #include <linux/string.h>
somewhere.
