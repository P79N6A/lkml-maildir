That behavior would be significantly different from the current one,
which is also used on all other biarch architectures. This probably
breaks lots of user setups.
I also think the current behavior is the right one. For things like
configure, you need a way to set the uname independent of the binary
format of your shell. Another example is building rpm packages
on a mixed system, where should be able to set the personality
to decide which target architecture to build for.
