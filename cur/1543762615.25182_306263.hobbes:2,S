To Arnd:
Another thing you should probably do is to build dosemu with debug
information, and then look into ~/.dosemu/boot.log after it crashes.
That will give you the contents of /proc/self/maps, a gdb backtrace and
various other goodies.
I've checked it myself but can't reproduce, neither with plain dosemu
1.2.2 nor with current CVS.
