Hi Greg,
what do you mean with desktop use? X11-System? Then please add also your
used grafic card and the X11 driver. I see this behaviour with lots of
binary only driver like from NVIDIA or ATI (perhaps they have problems
with the new 2.6.18 kernel).
Just to except that this is the cause for your lock ups.
Kind regards,
Michael Obster
