I've also seen this problem here, starting perhaps with 2.3.34, but I've
only seen the message twice, so it may have been before that.  I got one
of these files (Input/output error reported) later in the netfilter tree
after having compiling and installing it with no problems earlier in the
day.  I believe the first report came from updatedb.  I've also seen this
once while untarring and diffing the kernel tree.
