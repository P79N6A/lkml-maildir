Thank you for the nice summary. And, certainly the patch should be applied.
But you have described defective hardware. And despite the patch, it is still
possible for a malicious root to exploit this defective hardware. So, this
is ultimately a hardware manufacturer issue. A list of boards with the defective
disk controller chip should be released to the public, so consumers can be
aware of the problem and *NOT* purchase these controllers in the future.
