It does not, evidently. And 1 does not. But 10 is 10 times worse.

No. My point is to make it correctly eventually.
If you will repeat such attempts to "improve" it each third 2.4.x,
it will remain broken forever.

This problem has been solved ages ago. The only remaining question
is how to make this more nicely.

They are processed as soon as possible.
Ingo, I told net_rx_action() is small do_softirq() restarting not 10,
but not less than 300 times in row.
If this logic is wrong, you should explain why it is wrong.
Looping dozen of times may look like cure, but for me it still
looks rather like steroids.
