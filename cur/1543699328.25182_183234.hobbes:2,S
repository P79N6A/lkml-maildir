Jesse,
Linking to become one with the vmlinux (zen thing) or not able to achieve
a modular state, you are toast.  Loading a module is not linking.  Now
people claim that /proc/kcore is where the dirty work happens.
Is "/proc/kcore" real?
What makes it real?  Who makes it real?
If you, the user of the binary module, execute:
	cat /proc/kcore > /kcore.file
Who combined the works?
It was not the author(s), it was the effective enduser.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
