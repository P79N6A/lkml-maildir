Hi!
While compiling linux 2.6.0-test4-bk4, I got a weird error that some
initializers are not constants, in the pmu_handle_data()
function. Looking at the given line, there were EXPORT_SYMBOLs, so I
suspected that there's a missing brace somewhere. And that was it:
when CONFIG_PMAC_PBOOK is not set, the last if branch is not
closed. Adding an #else } #endif fixes the problem, patch attached
below.
While there, I also added another #ifdef (probably not too nice, and
there is most certainly a better way) to fix a minor compile warning
about `i' being used uninitialised in via_pmu_dev_init. This patch is
also attached below.
