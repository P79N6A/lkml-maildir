Hello,
As the number of such sites is still very small, I set up a new LXR 
site: 
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/
At last, it's an up to date site with an easy to remember URL.
Other LXR sites can be found on 
http://free-electrons.com/community/kernel/lxr
 . Let me know if you know 
other such sites!
    Cheers,
    Michael.
