I think you missed the point of the petition.  They're not asking
people to stop using bitkeeper. They're asking that it not be
advocated as an OFFICIAL kernel development/maintenance process.
As you said.. What you do in the privacy of your own home/office
is your business. On the other hand, what you advocate that the
Open Source community do in theirs is the business of the whole
community.
