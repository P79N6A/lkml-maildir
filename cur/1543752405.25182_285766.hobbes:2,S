Yes, a bug in atkbd.c, sorry. This fix:
ChangeSet@1.1966.1.261, 2005-01-06 17:42:15+01:00,
dtor_core@ameritech.net
  Input: atkbd - fix keycode table size initialization that got broken
         by my changes that exported 'set' and other settings via sysfs.
         setkeycodes should work again now.

now in my BK tree fixes it. Another fix from Dmitry for mouse naming is
in there too (and that's all that's there ATM).
