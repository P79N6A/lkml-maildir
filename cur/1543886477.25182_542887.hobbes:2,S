Not a huge problem. It doesn't scale in really horrible ways and the IPI
latency on a PIV or later is actually very good. Also the impact is less
than you might think as on huge huge boxes you want multiple copies of
the kernel text pages to reduce NUMA traffic, so you only have to sync
the group of processors involved

If you synchronize all the other processors and disable local interrupts
then the only traps you have to worry about are those you cause, and the
only person taking the trap will be you so you're ok.
NMI is hard but NMI is a special case not worth solving IMHO.

the errata so anything could happen.
I believe there are other safe sequences for doing code patching - perhaps
one of the Intel folk can advise ?
