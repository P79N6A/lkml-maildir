Subject: [PATCH 000/104] KVM patch queue for the 2.6.24 merge window
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/17/33

The following represents the patch queue for the 2.6.24, posted here for
review.  Most of the patches have already been on kvm-devel (and all of
them on kvm-commits), but some folding has occured to merge fixes
and to make the whole series bisect-friendly.
A few patches are likely to change in the near future; they will be reposted
if they do.
The most visible new feature is the in-kernel lapic/ioapic/pic emulation;
others include making kvm preemptible (a first step for guest swapping),
additional x86 emulator work, and Rusty Unleashed.
