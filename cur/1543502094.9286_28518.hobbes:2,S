Hello,
Two cases:
(1)	Dell PowerEdge 1300, Dual P-II/400, 64MB RAM (local system).
	Cyclom-8Yo ISA card (a multiport serial card).
	Cyclades driver 2.2.2.3_SMP_2 (experimental).
In this case, the Cyclom-Y card works just fine, being able to communicate
with the standard serial port.
(2)	Dell PowerEdge 2300, Dual P-II/400, 256MB RAM (client system).
	Cyclom-8Yo ISA card.
	Cyclades driver 2.2.2.3_SMP_2 (experimental).
In this case, /proc/interrupts does not see any interrupts being generated
by the Cyclom-Y card, even though the IRQ is registered by the driver
(i.e., it's listed in /proc/interrupts, yet with '0' interrrupts
generated).
If kernel is compiled as UP, the Cyclom-Y works fine, using the _same_ IRQ
that it tried to use on the SMP kernel.
I'm suspecting of a hardware issue here (something related to the IO-APIC
and the Cyclades ISA card, or something in this line), but I'm not sure.
Comments ?? Hints ?? Suggestions ??
Any help would be appreciated.
Regards,
Ivan Passos
