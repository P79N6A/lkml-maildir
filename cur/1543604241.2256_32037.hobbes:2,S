The benefits of the kernel Athlon optimizations are higher memory bandwidth
for bulk copies/clears and less cache pollution. But LMbench isn't going to
show any difference, because its tests use generic x86 mem*() functions, not
Athlon-optimized SSE memory routines like in the Athlon kernel.

It should be obvious that LMbench uses sub-optimal memory routines, since
the numbers for "Bcopy" and "Mem read/write" bandwidth are so much lower
than pipe and AF UNIX bandwidths! (the pipe/UNIX tests are basically
equivalent to Bcopy, plus extra user<->kernel transitions and context
switches).
The only cases where I'd expect the Athlon kernel to do better on LMbench
are essentially kernel memcpy() benchmarks - pipe and AF UNIX bandwidths.
I'm not sure if the kernel pipe and UNIX socket code actually uses
Athlon-optimized routines; in any case the small buffer sizes (eg 4KB for
pipes) could be hiding any performance gain.

Dan
