Excuse me? What strawman? If you want it spelled out - here it comes:
a) the scheme you've described will work
b) it's ugly
c) try to write down the full description and see how it will look like
d) I mean _full_ description, not one with all warts omitted
From your reaction it looks like the variant in your posting wasn't supposed
to be such a beast. Fine. Could you please demonstrate a snippet of manpage
describing the proposed semantics of "flags" in your variant of mount(2)?
Sorry, probably that's how I should formulate the question from the very
beginning. If you can make it complete and not ugly - you have my sincere
apologies, but I don't see how it can be done.
