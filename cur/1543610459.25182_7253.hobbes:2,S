2.2.20/IDE 05042001/no hpt patch/UDM33 gives no IDE errors, but
/dev/md0 md5sums still differ.
Since I didn't see the corruption with /dev/hde nor /dev/hdg, I'm beginning
to wonder if this is in fact RAID/VM/some other problem...?
2.2.19 included the VM rewrite, and I also patched the 2.2.20 kernel with
Andrea's VM-locked-1 -patch (which I figure shouldn't really affect read
path?)
The 2.2.18pre19 kernel (that works) uses 2.2.17-raid A0-patch, and
2.2.20 uses 2.2.19-A1. The differences between the two seems trivial.
I would be delighted if someone could confirm that 2.2.20+raid-A1 works 100%
correct... Just md5summing the contents of /dev/md0 3-4 times should do if
were lucky. It takes time, though...
