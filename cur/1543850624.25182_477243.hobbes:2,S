I think some system occasionally ramp the clock for thermal management,
but that should be rare.

Well they should have fixed the kernel to fall back to another clock
by backporting the appropiate fixes from mainline. I assume they
did actually.

No that shouldn't be true with any modern kernel. It will just fallback
to HPET or more likely PMtimer.

No, the kernel should work out of the box. Some older kernels didn't
at various points of time though.
