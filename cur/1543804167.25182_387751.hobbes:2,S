Which bits?
Why?
My current opinion is that you should:
 Use md for raid1, raid5, raid6 - anything with redundancy.
 Use dm for multipath, crypto, linear, LVM, snapshot
 Use either for raid0 (I don't think dm has particular advantages
     for md or md over dm).
These can be mixed together quite effectively:
  You can have dm/lvm over md/raid1 over dm/multipath
with no problems.
If there is functionality missing from any of these recommended
components, then make a noise about it, preferably but not necessarily
with code, and it will quite possibly be fixed.
