But how many events to we buffer?  When do we start to throw them away?
Fun policy decisions that we don't have to worry about in the current
scheme.
Also, what's the format of the kernel->user interface.  Today with
/sbin/hotplug it's a very simple, and easily changed interaction.  Using
a event reading mechanism lends itself to binary interfaces, which have
to be kept in sync with user code very tightly.
And yes, we could use ascii in the event list, but then again, a
userspace version of /sbin/hotplug that writes events to a pipe that is
read from a daemon enables the same thing to happen :)
