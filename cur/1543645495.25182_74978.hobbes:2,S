Not being able to unload LSM would suck enormously.  At last count, we
knew how to do this:
  1) Unhook the function hooks (using a call table simplifies this)
  2) Schedule on each CPU to ensure all tasks are out of the module
  3) A schedule where the module count is incremented doesn't count
and we rely on the rule that and module code that could sleep must be
bracketed by inc/dec of the module count.
Did somebody come up with a reason why this will not work?
