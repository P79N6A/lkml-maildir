klogd only handles some architectures.  klogd only knows about some
messages for the architectures it does handle.  klogd does not verify
that it was passed the correct System.map.  klogd does not always know
about loaded modules.  Even when klogd knows about loaded modules, it
does not use the __insmod symbols to correctly map the modules.  I
could go on but you get the idea.
