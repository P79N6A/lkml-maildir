There is an inconsistancy here.  Your raidtab says "nr-raid-disks 2",
but mdstat shows there is only 1 raid-disk in the array.
You will need to recreate the array using "mkraid -R /dev/md0"
 with a raidtab of

or with
     mdadm -C /dev/md0 --level=1 -n 2 /dev/hdc2 missing
Then "raidhotadd /dev/md0 /dev/hdb2"  or "mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/hdb2"
should add the other drive in.
Ofcourse  you will need to unmount /usr and "raidstop -a" or "mdadm -Ss"
first.
