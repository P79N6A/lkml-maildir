The latest sched-devel.git tree can be pulled from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git
This is a quick iteration after yesterday's: a couple of group 
scheduling bugs were found/debugged and fixed by Srivatsa Vaddagiri and 
Mike Galbraith. There's also a yield fix from Dmitry Adamushko, a build 
fix from S.Ceglar Onur and Andrew Morton, a cleanup from Hiroshi 
Shimamoto and the usual stream of goodies from Peter Zijlstra. Rebased 
it to -rc8 as well.
there are no known regressions at the moment in the sched-devel.git 
codebase. (yay :)
