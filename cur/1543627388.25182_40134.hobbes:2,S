Subject: Problem with macro IN6_ARE_ADDR_EQUAL

I found out that the definition of the macro IN6_ARE_ADDR_EQUAL
in the file netinet/in.h is erroneous. In kernel 2.4.16 it is
#define IN6_ARE_ADDR_EQUAL(a,b) \
	((((uint32_t *) (a))[0] == ((uint32_t *) (b))[0]) && \
	 (((uint32_t *) (a))[1] == ((uint32_t *) (b))[2]) && \
	 (((uint32_t *) (a))[2] == ((uint32_t *) (b))[1]) && \
	 (((uint32_t *) (a))[3] == ((uint32_t *) (b))[3]))
This macro checks the a[1] with the b[2] instead of b[1] and also
the a[2] with the b[1] instead of b[2], as a result it returns false
for equal ipv6 addresses.
