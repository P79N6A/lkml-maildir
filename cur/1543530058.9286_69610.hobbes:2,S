What makes you think getting it into the kernel will get reiserfs
developers off the hook? They will still have to care for 3 branches (2.2,
2.4 and 2.5) anyway, and if anything the bug report load will go skywards.
I'd say fix it up, _then_ put it into the kernel. Perhaps in the first 2.4
releases, as new/experimental stuff. That should in the end really ease the
workload of the developers.
