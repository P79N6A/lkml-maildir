That seems very hard to do ... all of the generic code here only knows
about the base page size, so except if we're going to fully re-implement
the mmap/mprotect logic from scratch, it's going to hurt, or am I
missing something ?
I suppose we could add wrappers to those syscalls that always set the
protection map to "no access" over the target area (from within
get_unmapped_area for mmap as we don't know the area yet), and then,
update it after the successful call.
But mprotect seems a clumsy way to control the per-sub-page permission
in that case as we don't want to change the underlying real 64k page
permission.
