The thread isn't about kbuild. It's about <omitted>. Please do not confuse
the two or even mention them in the same mail. It only serves to promote the 
confusion.
kbuild is far more obviously the right thing to do. The main objection to it
last time I saw a discussion was that it has a performance problem in
certain cases -- which I believe Keith is working on. 
It's not clear to me that you asking for it to be reconsidered before that's
complete is useful.
