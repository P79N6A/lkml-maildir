The Linux kernel development process isn't that much formalized. But if 
someone finds a serious new problem in a -rc kernel a fix will usually 
go into the next -rc.
Compared to some other open source projects like e.g. Debian the Linux 
kernel has a pretty well-working release process (and the 2.6 
development avoided several mistakes of the 2.4 development).

The way kernel releases currently work IMHO works well with the 
exception that there should be a last -rc that should be released as 
-final a few days later if no problems show up.
What other actual problems do you currently observe?
