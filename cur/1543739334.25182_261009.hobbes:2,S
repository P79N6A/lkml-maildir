Oh, it already is. The VESA driver is not actually done yet so the only 
drivers using VideoBoot right now are the accelerated ones ;-)

Not really. In many cases there may be a secondary controller on the 
system that is not wanted, such as when the user has an i915G or other 
chipset with integrated video but has plugged a different video card into 
the system. The integrated video can still be active so trying to bring 
it up may be problematic unless it is really wanted.

Cool. So this stuff is not yet in the official kernel trees. Is that 
going to happen or is the project to move the video out of the kernel 
going to happen first?

Yes, but if you don't need a framebuffer console on the card then X or 
whatever can bring up the secondary controller from user space once the 
kernel has booted.
