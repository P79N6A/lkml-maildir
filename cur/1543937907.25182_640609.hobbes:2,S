The compiler checks types, and we should use it (though note that when I 
typesafed the kthread code I didn't find any bugs, so safety arguments must 
be muted).  The gratuitous casts back and forth are annoying and silly.
The compatibility nightmare is one reason for the previous patch (which you  
didn't understand, I hope it's now clear).

True, but this is not about performance.  It's about making code simpler and 
compiler-checkable.
Rusty.
