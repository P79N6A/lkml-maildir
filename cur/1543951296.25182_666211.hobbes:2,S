What are you doing to your kernel?
My desktop at home, which runs my MTA, web site etc, and is subject to
regular oom abuse by firefox:
$ uptime
04:36:49 up 204 days,  9:38,  8 users,  load average: 0.82, 0.43, 0.20
This machine has been up ever since I got a UPS for it, and then it
only ever went down due to a blackout or my wife blowing a fuse with
the vacuum cleaner.  Honestly, I have never seen a machine running
Linux 2.6 crash due to a software flaw, except when I caused it
myself.  I suspect the Linux kernel has a better MTBF than a hard
disk.

It works for EMC :-)

I agree this would be a nice option to have.

In fact, replicating was one of the strategies I considered for this.
But since it is a lot more work and will not perform as well as a
simple sweep, I opted for the simple thing.  Which turned out to
be pretty complex anyway.  You have to close all the same nasty
races but with a considerably more complex base algorithm.  I think
that better wait for version 2.0.
By the way, I could use a hand debugging this thing.
