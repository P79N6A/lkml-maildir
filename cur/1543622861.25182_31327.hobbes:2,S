etc. etc.
Turns out ide_pio_timings_t is only defined within a
  #ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES block. That one seems to only kick
  in if I select at least one if the IDE chipsets. Mine is a PIIX4,
  but the configuration help seems to suggest I only set it if I
  suspect BIOS problems so I can hand-tune the chipset via hdparm;
  "if unsure, say N". I've been doing so for more time than I can
  remember without any issue and a spiffy hdparm output - this is
  the current 2.4.19-pre1 from which I built 2.5.6-pre2:
[root@dolphin root]# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.80 seconds =160.00 MB/sec
  Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.99 seconds = 16.04 MB/sec
I now built the kernel after selecting PIIXn support, but is this
  a bug in the dependencies or in the configuration help text for
  the PIIXn chipsets ?
Thanks,
