There's a problem with that -- despite its name, CONFIG_MULTIQUAD is used for 
the old NUMA-Q hardware.  It turns on some memory mapped port I/O code that 
doesn't have any purpose for other machines.  The PCI bus overflow happens on 
our new Foster-based boxes that may or may not contain multiple quad CPU 
boards.
Still, CONFIG_MULTIQUAD is better than nothing.  It just may take a little 
bit of redefinition, so long as we can coax the various distros to build 
their installation and working kernels with CONFIG_MULTIQUAD turned on....

OK, what do you think about this:
