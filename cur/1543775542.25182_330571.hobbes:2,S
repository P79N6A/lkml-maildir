No, bind/unbind (well bind, unbind doesn't care) only will work if the
driver's probe function can accept the device.  Without dynamic ids,
it's not possible to have a driver bind to a device that it does not
know about.
I want to put the sysfs file, and a common callback in the driver core,
to make it easier for busses to support dynamic ids.  That's why I am
suggesting we add it there.  But I'll play with implementing it and see
if it's really worth it or not.
Either way, this patch fixes up the pci code to make the dynamic ids for
it, much more readable and smaller.

True, if you look at the current pci dynamic id stuff, we don't set the
driver_data field at all.  Some USB drivers use this field too.

For this to happen, we would have to rewrite all drivers :(  Right now
they assume that the MODULE_TABLE must have matched, in order for the
probe() call to be called.  
Remember, probe() of most busses pass in a valid id structure too...

If the bus/driver core supports dynamic ids, then the individual drivers
don't have to be changed at all :)
