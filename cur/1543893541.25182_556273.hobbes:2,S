but there's a change in the interpretation of bit 6:
-       if (!(sysctl_sched_features & 64)) {
-               this_load = this_rq->raw_weighted_load;
+       if (sysctl_sched_features & 64) {
+               this_load = this_rq->lrq.raw_weighted_load;
the update of the cpu_load[] value is timer interrupt driven, but the 
_value_ that is sampled is not. Previously we used ->raw_weighted_load 
(at whatever value it happened to be at the moment the timer irq hit the 
system), now we basically use a load derived from the fair-time passed 
since the last scheduler tick. (Mathematically it's close to an integral 
of load done over that period) So it takes all scheduling activities and 
all load values into account to calculate the average, not just the 
value that was sampled by the scheduler tick.
this, besides being more precise (it for example correctly samples 
short-lived, timer-interrupt-driven workloads too, which were largely 
'invisible' to the previous load calculation method), also enables us to 
make the scheduler tick hrtimer based in the (near) future. (in essence 
making the scheduler tick-less even when there are tasks running)

yes, i agree in general, even though this causes some small overhead. 
This also has another advantage: the inter-policy isolation and load 
balancing is similar to what fair group scheduling does, so even 'plain' 
Linux will use the majority of the framework.

no, i'd rather avoid that #ifdeffery.

i'd still like to hear back from Kirill & co whether this framework is 
flexible enough for their work (OpenVZ, etc.) too.
