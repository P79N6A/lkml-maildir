Hi,
I'm running debian etch in linux 2.6.21.[34], and ran into troubles with
heartbeat:
In some cases, I get "
Jun 12 13:14:36 sf1 heartbeat[2973]: ERROR: No local heartbeat. Forcing restart.
Jun 12 13:14:36 sf1 heartbeat[2973]: WARN: Late heartbeat: Node sf1: interval 42740 ms
"
The heartbeat configuration files were copied from another debian machine,
running 2.6.18-3-xen-686 stock debian kernel, with no problems. 
The machine is not loaded, I'm just testing heartbeat on it.
Other information:
gcc version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)
Third-party modules:
aoe6-47
iSCSI Enterprise Target   latest svn checkout
The machines are Dell poweredge 2650 machines, with 2 GHz Intel Xeon CPUs.
I tried both with NOHZ and high resolution timers enabled and disabled, the
results are the same.
Any suggestions, help would be appreciated.
