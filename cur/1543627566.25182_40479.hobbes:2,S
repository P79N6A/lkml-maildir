Personally yes, but others would disagree.
In fact, if we use a define setup_per_cpu_areas can not be used outside
of this compilation unit.  Right now this looks to be the case, but if
something other than init/main.c wanted to use setup_per_cpu_areas we
would need to make the code an actual function or put the define in a
header file.
Since either case should optimize away, maybe we should make it a static
inline in both cases, since that is the authors original preference ...
