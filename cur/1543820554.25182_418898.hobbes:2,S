Default owner and mode are handled by the kernel because otherwise it
would indeed be inherently problematic.  Don't expect normal
applications, editors or xml libraries to change from the normal
open(fname, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666).  SELinux is not, and will
not, ever, be their problem.

"The" kernel mechanism?  The point of LSM is that there wasn't to be
one official and unique kernel mechanism.  You alternating between
"this is not acceptable because it is not SELinux" and "this is not
acceptable because it can be done with SELinux" gets a little tiring.

The implementation sucks, news at eleven.  At that point SELinux sucks
too, only differently, and don't even protect what is really
important[1].  Anyway, LSM is lacking path-based hooks, they should be
added in a reasonable fashion that indeed do not require regenerating
the paths or horribly slowing down hotpath code.
