+Summary: Kernel Panic at install
+
+System: Intel P150
+RAM: 64M
+SCSI: Adaptec 2920
+
+
+
+Previous OS RH5.2 ran without fault. We selected an Install
+not an Upgrade.
+
+On install. In 2nd stage while installing packages get error
+message:
+
+Kernel panic: scsi: <fdomain> fdomain_16x0_queue() NOT
+REENTRANT! In swapper task - not syncing
+
+Install fails 100%!
The lernel panic listed above occurs at random points during install and then
post install when I was downloading new kernel sources via ftp on a local net it
did it again. We've done about 20 installs testing this and it just does it at
random.
It's in bugzilla at RH it's # 4670
http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4670
We did have reproduceable installation success by booting from the install CD
and bypassing the floppy but it was only reproduecable in the sense that we were
able to complete an install twice. The problem still occurred during install and
post install.
If there's anything else you'd like me to do to help just ask!
