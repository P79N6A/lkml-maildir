It's the other way around: a real 80386 doesn't need the early exception 
handling, all other cpus need it.
The WP test works by writing to a write-protected page while at ring 0. 
A real 80386 ignores the write-protected bit, later x86 cpus honor it 
and cause a page fault.
Rusty, against which kernel is the patch you have posted? I've tried 
both 2.5.54 and the latest bk shapshot from www.kernel.org, I get an 
patch error in kernel/extable.c.
