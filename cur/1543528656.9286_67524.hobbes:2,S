It's not abandoned at all - a part of it is in the USB support in the
recent kernels - and that's what I've been developing lately. Now that
USB is quite stable, I can return to developing the other parts of the
input driver suite.
Anyway, the rest is not going in before 2.4 - slated for 2.5 when a big
console revamp is going to happen.
