But see, that's the problem. You think _other people_ should spend
time reviewing your work first so _you_ don't have to waste time.
Unfortunately, it looks to me like no one is willing to spend their
time reviewing a patch which (a) does not follow
Documentation/CodingStyle and (b) is not submitted as per
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
I mean, how much work is it to run you code through scripts/Lindent
and drop those awful function banner comments and resend the patch?-)
