I had considered doing that - I believe that some of the framebuffer
code supports multiple heads as well(?) - but in this particular case it
wasn't appropriate - the whole point was to demonstrate what could be
achieved using only a command line ;-)  Also, though, on dedicated servers
etc. I'd rather not be running X if I didn't have to.  Would this be a
particularly difficult thing to implement as a kernel patch?  I'd like to
try to get involved in kernel development at some point and am looking for
something to ease myself in slowly - preferably something useful but
unimportant ;-)  Are there any show stoppers involved here - or does
anyone have any other ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Simon
