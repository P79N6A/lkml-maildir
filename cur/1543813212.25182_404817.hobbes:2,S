Just interested: do the locks have any sort of locality of lookup?
If so, then have you tried moving hot (ie. the one you've just found,
or newly inserted) hash entries to the head of the hash list?
In applications with really good locality you can sometimes get away
with small hash tables (10s even 100s of collisions on average) without
taking too big a hit this way, because your entries basically get sorted
LRU for you.
