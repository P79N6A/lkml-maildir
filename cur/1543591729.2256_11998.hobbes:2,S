I know.  But these derivations are only for the old 68K macs, which don't
have PCI.  Closed issue.

But the other side is going to ask: suppose you're memory-limited
(quite likely on older SBCs) and don't want to pay the core cost of
drivers you won't use?  I don't really think we can duck this question
by talking about boot-time parameters.

That's my gut feeling, too.  But a lot of people insist that the only right 
way is totally fine-grained control, even in weird edge cases like this one.

Interesting thought...
