Could you just try
# echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk && echo disk > /sys/power/state
without unloading any modules and see what happens (it should suspend
to disk)?
If it craches, could you boot the kernel with the init=/bin/bash option and try
# mount /sys
# mount /proc
# /sbin/swapon -a
# echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk && echo disk > /sys/power/state
and see what happens?
