Interesting.

Will it represent single segment filesystems as one node (ie extremely
efficiently). The reason I ask is that one thing EVMS does that I think is
right is that it lets you throw away the whole partitioning business.
Instead  DOS partition format, BSD disklabel etc are simply very limited
logical volumes
