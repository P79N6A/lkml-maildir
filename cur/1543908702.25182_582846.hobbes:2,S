You don't necessarily need more list management if you don't 
plan to remove entries, but just replace them.
e.g. what could work to atomically replace is: 
- Make the buffer a pointer to an allocated buffer that also
contains a struct rcu_head.
- Reader: Does rcu_read_lock() around list walk (that just disables
preemption on preemptible kernels and is otherwise a nop).
Also uses rcu_reference for reading the pointer. 
- Writer: Continues using the mutex to protect against other writers.
When changing an entry allocate a new buffer + rcu_head. Initialize
buffer. Replace pointer.  Free old buffer using call_rcu() 
The RCU would just make sure the buffer is not freed while other
CPUs are still accessing it. It also means they can use stale
rules for a time, but it is a strictly bounded time
(bounded to max time walking the list plus max time any interrupt
handlers inbetween run [admittedly that can be very long in theory, 
but it's all logically only a single rule check])
