Any measurable performance difference?
Any important changes from the driver that used to be on

It is needed on some cards when rebooting from some other OSes that power
down the card (eg vt6102 chips on win98). The writeb causes the chip
itself to reload the hardware address from eeprom. Perhaps it no longer
finds the eeprom and just reads 0xff from some unmapped memory space.
Does it work to enable MMIO after the reset code?
