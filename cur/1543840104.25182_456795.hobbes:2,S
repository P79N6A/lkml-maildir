7.18.1.4 Integertypes capable of holding object pointers
"1 The following type designates a signed integer type with the
property that any valid
pointer to void can be converted to this type, then converted back to
pointer to void,
and the result will compare equal to the original pointer:"
Dunno if this means that x86-64 needs yet another typedef, or if using
long for intptr_t is incorrect. But assuming a different integer type
was used instead of intptr_t, that is known to be able to hold a
pointer, would there still be any problems?
I'm unable to see anything specific about AIO in your kevent patch
that these modifications wouldn't support.
