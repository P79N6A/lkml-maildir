Did you read the discussion that lead up to it? I thought that quite
clearly described why such a thing was needed.
Config options need to clearly distinguish what they're for, or people
will screw them up ... given:
config DEBUG_RUNTIME_CHECKS
	bool "Enable runtime debug checks"
config DEBUG_RUNTIME_CHECKS_ALL
	bool "Enable all runtime debug checks"
	depends on DEBUG_RUNTIME_CHECKS
... how is either the user meant to know under which of these to find
things, or the coder introducing a new feature supposed to know where
to put stuff? They're not very descriptive.
Please can we have a more constructive discussion that "it's wrong,
nack" ?
