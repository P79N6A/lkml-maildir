Basically, they had the whole address space consisting of mmaped files.
address was (segment << 18) + offset (both up to 18 bits) and primitive
was "attach segment (== file) to address space". Each segment had its
own page table, BTW. Directories were special segments and contained
references to other segments (both files and directories). Root had fixed
ID. You could lookup segment by name.
