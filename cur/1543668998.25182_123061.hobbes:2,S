Well, you don't get zero overhead whatever you do. You either pay the
cost at remap time of manipulating sub-objects, or the cost at page-touch
time of the pte_chains stuff. I suspect sub-objects are cheaper if we
read /write the 32K chunks, not if people mostly just touch one page
per remap though.
What do you think about using this for the linear stuff though?
