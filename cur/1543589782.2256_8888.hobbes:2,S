I belong to a small group of students at Northern Michigan University who
have spent the last 3 months running LMBench on Linux kernels from 2.0.1 to
2.4.0 we have some interesting results at:
http://euclid.nmu.edu/~benchmark
On our web site we have graphs for what we thought were the important
areas. Including signal handling, mmap latency, lines of code, and context
switching.
If you would like to email our group directly the address is
benchmark@euclid.acs.nmu.edu
I apologize for resubmitting this but I put the wrong email address to
contact the group.
Thanks
