Yeah, sorry ... I guess someone should have published the phone conversation
we had yesterday ... </me pokes Dave in the eye>
We came to the conclusion that should be adding the semaphore to the current 
code even, as list_add_tail isn't atomic to a doubly linked list (unless
maybe you can do some fancy-pants compare and exchange thing after setting
up the prev pointer of the new element already). Which is probably going
to suck performance-wise, but I'd prefer correctness. From there we can
make a better judgment, but it sounds like it's going to content horribly
on those busy semaphores. 
cat /proc/*/maps | nawk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c
reveals that we have 600 or so mappings to libc and ld splattered around,
which seems fairly low load ... SDET is doing bunches of shell scripts,
which probably generates the high operations on top of that.
I think the "list of lists" thing will help this, but unless we do 
something like RCU here, I don't see how we can do much to this data
structure without death-by-semaphore contention.

Yeah, I was being grumpy and threw it all out ;-) Needs more
thought before we decide what to do with this stuff.
