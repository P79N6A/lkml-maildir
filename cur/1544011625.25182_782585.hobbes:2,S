vmsplice() isn't the right choice, but splice() very well could be. You
could easily use splice internally as well. The vmsplice() part sort-of
applies in the sense that you want to fill pages into a pipe, which is
essentially what vmsplice() does. You'd need some helper to do that. And
the ack-on-xmit-done bits is something that splice-to-socket needs
anyway, so I think it'd be quite a suitable choice for this.
