Yeah, this (very likely) due to the new SACK processing (in net-2.6.25). 
I'll look what could go wrong with fack_count calculations, most likely 
it's the reason (I've found earlier one out-of-place retransmission 
segment in one of my test case which already indicated that there's 
something incorrect with them but didn't have time to debug it yet).
Thanks for report. Some info about how easily you can reproduce & 
couple of sentences about the test case might be useful later on when 
evaluating the fix.
