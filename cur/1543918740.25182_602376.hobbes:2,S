He did say "sane".
Good internationalisation requires you know where the messages are and
where the substitutions (%foo) are. So the entire operation would in fact
require
1.	An option to set "translation friendly please"
2.	A tiny modification to the snprintfoo code to support putting
some kind of marker before/after arguments and maybe doubling a symbol to
avoid vagueness
The submission is overkill compared to what is required for translation
tools and syslog.
