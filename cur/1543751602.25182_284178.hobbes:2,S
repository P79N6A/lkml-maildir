Hi,
Thanks for your replies Dick Johnson and Arnd
Bergmann.

The BASE_ADDRESS is a physical address (0xfe8f0000)
that points to the RAM memory on the PCI card, which I
tried to remap so that the kernel can address it using
memcpy.
Initially, I wrote a pci driver (character driver
interface) to test memory read/write operations to
this physical address (after ioremap) using
readl/writel. This worked fine.

This being a block driver I only define
block_device_operations. How would I declare and use
the file_operations read(), write() routines?

Which is where it fails.

I shall test it with the 2.6.10 kernel.
Thanks again,
