Subject: [BUG] softirq.c races on TASKLET_STATE_SCHED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/8/27/27

A couple of bugfixes were attempted here, so the line numbers are munged,
but they made no difference as to where the BUG() occurred.
Cheers,
Bill
