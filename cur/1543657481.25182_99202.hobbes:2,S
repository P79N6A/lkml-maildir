I'd still rather have configuration completely eliminate that particular
pool allocator on the platforms (most, by volume) that don't need it,
in favor of the slab code ... which is not only well-tested, but also
has had a fair amount of cross-platform performance work done on it.

I'd have no problems with making it even more generic, and moving it.
Though "compile options" doesn't sound right, unless you mean letting
arch-specific code choose whether to use that or the slab allocator.
