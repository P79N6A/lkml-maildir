Yes.  Why do you mix the two?  These are completely separate issues.

BASE_VIDIOCPRIVATE is defined in videodev.h and used by various drivers
in drivers/media/video

I doubt this.  IMHO the complex part isn't the read/write interface and
the string parsing (I'd expect this can easily separated out into some
kind of library / kernel module / whatever).  The complex part is to
keep the backward compatibility while changing/improving the interfaces
(which is one of your goals with the new approach, right?), and I don't
see a way to handle that in generic, driver-independant code ...
