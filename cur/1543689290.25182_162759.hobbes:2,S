Since I copied this part of Rob's watchdog-patch, I'll let Rob answer this one.

Thanks, I'll fix this (And I'll take out the module_param's for wdt_start and wdt_stop 
also).

Sorry Justin, I normally cc the authors, but this time I indeed overlooked it. Sorry 
for that. Concerning the duplicated code: this is done intentionally; Rob and myself
won't to get the watchdog-drivers all at the same level so that we can then remove the
duplicate code and have some generic watchdog code that can be used (I allready have 
code for it, but I'm redoing the temperature stuff). After that we plan to foresee sysfs
interfacing for the drivers (can be done easily if you use the generic watchdog code).
the generic code indeed uses a watchdog_ops like interface. Hope this clarifies things 
a bit more. (So I try to do everything via a "phased" approach rather then go directly 
for the generic watchdog model code).
Greetings,
Wim.
