Jupp, if you know the physical address range of the RAM, it's a piece
of cake. Except that the slram option parsing is not user-friendly,
with me being an examplary user.
For memory above 4GB, things are harder. Basically you'd have to write
a new mtd driver that copies some of the highmem code. Maybe a day or
two plus testing.

Go ahead and try it. If it 'feels' faster, it should be possible to
benchmark your feeling into some numbers.
