I thought of couple of reasons.
- A very different syntax to modify the priority.
- Separate directories allow easy future extensions in terms of more
  files. For example, putting a small "description" file in each dir
  where each registered user can specify what does it do.
But I agree that a single file is good for consolidated view. As bernhard
suggested, may be we should also implement a read only file where one
will get a consolidated view.

I think first come first serve would be appropriate in this case instead of
returning -EINVAL.
