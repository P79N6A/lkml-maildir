Hi,
(Hope this gets into linux-kernel. Lately vger rejects e-mails from
my ISP in Israel, leading to the effect that my posts to linux-kernel
are considered spam and rejected, which makes it very hard for me
to participate in the discussion).

ide-scsi is both a low level SCSI host adapter driver and a low level
IDE subdriver. As such, it is using the request queue as every IDE
subdriver, but does not support normal block device read/write requests
from the ll_rw_block layer, and prints a warning when it gets such a
request.
Instead, when ide-scsi gets a request from the higher SCSI layers,
it creates a request with a special "cmd" code and queues it on
its subdriver queue. Those are the requests which can be serviced
by the low level part of ide-scsi.
Could you please update me on what's happened recently, and what
seems to be the problem? I haven't been the following latest developments.
From the context, I get the impression that there were some enhancements
to the block device layer, and that the partition scan of an ATAPI ZIP
under ide-scsi no longer works?
In any case, ide-scsi does not scan the partition table itself. It's
the SCSI disk driver's, sd.c, which does that. ide-scsi will just accept
the SCSI CDB and send them as packet commands on the IDE bus.
Cheers,
Gadi
