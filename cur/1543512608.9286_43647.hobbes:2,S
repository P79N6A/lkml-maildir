What about adding to the end of ext2_alloc_block:
bh = get_hash_table(inode->i_dev, result, inode->i_sb->s_blocksize);
/* something is playing with our fresh block, make them stop.  ;-) */
if (bh) {
	if (buffer_dirty(bh)) {	
		mark_buffer_clean(bh);
		wait_on_buffer(bh);
	}
	bforget(bh);
}
This is in a relatively slow/uncommon path and also catches
races if indirect blocks are allocated to a file, instead
of just directory syncs.
Ultimately we really want to have indirect blocks, and
the directory in the page cache as it should result in
more uniform code, and faster partial truncates (as well as faster
syncs).
