You misunderstood the proposal  (actually there is a prototype, so it's
more than that)
The reason the TSCs need to be synchronized is that gettimeofday always
takes the offset against a global variable set by the last timer interrupt.
So your TSC needs to be synchronized to the CPU of the TSC that runs
the timer interrupt.
If instead the per CPU timers set a cpu local variable then you
can do the offset calculation per CPU. 
The scheduler already uses this trick by keeping sched_clock comparisions
always CPU local.
In practice there are a few more complications, but that's it in a nutshell.
