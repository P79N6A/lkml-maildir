Btw, that "invalidate_inode_pages()" thing is just wrong - we can't just
remove pages that are mapped etc, because that would result in no end of
fun aliasing problems etc.
I don't see why invalidate_inode_pages() would be called for this
sequence, though, which is why I'd be more likely to blame the truncate
case, but I think you're right about invalidate_inode_pages() being a
problem none-the-less.
How about adding a test in invalidate_inode_pages() like
		/* We cannot invalidate a locked page */
		if (TryLockPage(page))
			continue;
+		/* We cannot invalidate a page that is in use */
+		if (page_count(page) != 1) {
+			UnlockPage(page);
+			continue;
+		}
+
		__lru_cache_del(page);
		__remove_inode_page(page);
Because otherwise we might end up invalidating pages that might have
pending write-back etc (although I think the NFS logic tries to avoid
invalidating when there's pending activity).
