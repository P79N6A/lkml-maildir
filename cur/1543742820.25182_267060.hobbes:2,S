I am not wrong.
I don't understand anything about your theoretical CPU
with the magic stack engine. Anything I can get my
hands on functions exactly as I described and exactly
as would be expected. We work with real hardware here
and I have to test it as part of my job.
And, FYI, I spend all my working time trying to get the
last iota of performance out of ix86 CPUS. Since I can
only read publicly available documentation, I have
to test code in actual operation.
The attached file shows that the Intel Pentium 4 runs
exactly as I described. Further, there is no difference in
the CPU clocks used when adding a constant to the stack-
pointer or using LEA.
It also shows that poping stack-data into the same register
twice, as you suggested, takes the same time as using a
different register.
Timer overhead = 88 CPU clocks
push 3, pop 3 = 12 CPU clocks
push 3, pop 2 = 12 CPU clocks
push 3, pop 1 = 12 CPU clocks
push 3, pop none using ADD = 8 CPU clocks
push 3, pop none using LEA = 8 CPU clocks
push 3, pop into same register = 12 CPU clocks
The code uses a separate assembly-language file so that
the 'C' compiler can't optimize-away what I am measuring.
It also saves and uses the shortest number of CPU cycles
so the code doesn't have to execute with the interrupts
OFF to get a stable reading.
