Subject: [2.0.36] Strange behaviour when large BSS causes OOM

I'm debugging Mesa against the Quake3 IHV.  The executable I have has a
very large BSS segment, 78MB, and only after quite a bit of effort did I
come to understand that the following wierd behaviour was in fact an
out-of-memory condition triggered when the bss exceeded available core &
swap.
If I have lots of free memory:
# ldd ./quake3
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x40004000)
        libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6 (0x4009b000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x400a6000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/libm.so.6 (0x400aa000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x400c3000)
# ./quake3  
	... runs normally
If I start up netscape and emacs, free core + swap falls below 78MB, and
I get:
# ldd ./quake3
        not a dynamic executable
# ./quake3
	... segfaults on the first assignment to a static variable.
I don't know if this is a bug or just 'undefined behaviour', but it
seems strange that exec() should succeed even though it must have failed
to allocate the bss segment - there is no way that the call to padzero()
in load_elf_interp() could have succeeded.  (Note that I'm looking at an
old 2.1.1xx source, but running a pristine redhat 5.2 with the default
2.0.36 kernel).
I think exec should detect this condition, and fail with ENOMEM.  This
would be equivalent to what would happen if you tried to call brk(2)
with a similar value directly from userland.
If you don't have quake3 handy, here is a smaller program with similar
behaviour:
--------
static int m[100000000];
int main()
{
   m[1000] = 44;
   return m[0];
}
---------
