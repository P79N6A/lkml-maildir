?! The docs I've read state that softirq:s are not executed until all
the hardirq:s have finished processing. And looking at your code, that
seems to still hold true. A softirq running esdhc_tasklet_card() gets
preempted by a hard irq and we have the lockup.
If you're running the code you sent a few minutes later, then something
is broken with your platform as esdhc_tasklet_card() clearly tries to
disable interrupts when it grabs the lock.
