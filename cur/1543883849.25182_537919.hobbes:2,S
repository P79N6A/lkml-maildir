I agree with Dave for most if not all of the above.
Typing, for example unsigned / uint32 vs u32, __u32 is very easily 
fixable once we decide on a clear way to go to keep  (if we want to 
keep) compatibility with *bsd.
For the IOCTL checking, as Dave states, most invalid data will be 
trapped in hash lookups and
checks in the buffer validation system, but probably far from all. A 
fuzzer would be a nice tool to trap the exceptions.
