1. Linux ACL development mailing list
2. Implementation efforts
1. Mailing List for development of ACLs for Linux
There exists a mailing list for discussion of ACLs for Linux at:
  <mailto:acl-devel@bestbits.at>
To subscribe send a message with `subscribe' in the mail body to:
  <mailto:majordomo@bestbits.at>
The list's focus currently is general ACL support in Linux, and Posix-like ACL
support for ext2.
2. Implementation efforts
Two projects aiming at ACL support for Linux are known to us. The project
homepages are:
Posix ACLs for Linux
  <
http://acl.bestbits.at

ACLs for ext2
