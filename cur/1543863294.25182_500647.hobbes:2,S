Please revert 2.6.19's 99a10a60ba9bedcf5d70ef81414d3e03816afa3f (shown
below) for 2.6.20.  Nadia Derbey has reported that mmap of /dev/kmem no
longer works with the kernel virtual address as offset, and Franck has
confirmed that his patch came from a misunderstanding of what an offset
means to /dev/kmem - whereas his patch description seems to say that he
was correcting the offset on a few plaforms, there was no such problem
to correct, and his patch was in fact changing its API on all platforms.

[PATCH] Fix up mmap_kmem
vma->vm_pgoff is an pfn _offset_ relatif to the begining
of the memory start. The previous code was doing at first:
	vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT
which results into a wrong physical address since some
platforms have a physical mem start that can be different
from 0. After that the previous call __pa() on this
wrong physical address, however __pa() is used to convert
a _virtual_ address into a physical one.
This patch rewrites this convertion. It calculates the
pfn of PAGE_OFFSET which is the pfn of the mem start
then it adds the vma->vm_pgoff to it.
It also uses virt_to_phys() instead of __pa() since the
latter shouldn't be used by drivers.
