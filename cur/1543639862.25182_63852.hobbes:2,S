fixing this too would be very nice indeed.

yes.
from the practical POV right now we have a dualness of APIs. exit() is a
way to exit a current thread and destroy it. execve() is a way to exit()  
the current thread and bootstrapping a completely new thread from scratch
- while saving over some well-specified state into the new thread.
so for any threading library to handle execve() correctly, there needs to
be some way to specify an mm_release event. It's in essence the same
'exit' conceptual thing we do in both the sys_exit() and sys_execve()
case, but it's accessible via two external interfaces.
one solution would be a new syscall to set 'VM exit notification' address
and value in the released VM. But since it would always come in pair with
sys_exit() or sys_execve(), it would be nicer to have a composite syscalls
as well - ie. exit_release_user_mm() and execve_release_user_mm(). I know
this is a pain to look at, but i dont have any better ideas right now. The
composite syscalls also have the advantage that no additional per-thread
field has to be used, since user-space can be notified right at the
beginning.
hm, maybe there's an idea: perhaps the most elegant way would be to handle
this at clone() time: if the CLONE_NOTIFY_MM_RELEASE flag is specified
then the top of the user stack address is taken as the notification
address. (or a new parameter can be used.) And the notification can as
well be an implicit 'set to 0' rule. [so it's basically a VM lock extended
to userspace.] The user-space stack's address is known at clone() time
already, nothing wants to change that address until exit() time.
mm_release() then sees this address set in current->, and notifies the
userspace VM of the release. No need for new syscalls, and *all* 'exit'
variants in the future will automatically have this capability, without
having to create clumsy composite syscalls.

yes.
