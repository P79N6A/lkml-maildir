Because hwifs are statically allocated, see drivers/ide/ide.c:
ide_hwif_t ide_hwifs[MAX_HWIFS];        /* master data repository */
Also if names are ide0..ide9, the following would be ide: and ide; (see
init_hwif_data in drivers/ide/ide.c).

You can try and set MAX_HWIFS to 12 too (see include/asm-i386/ide.h),
but you may find other problems.
I don't know ide layer very much, I'm sorry but I can't help you more.
