Len,
 just to confirm that the mentioned patch fixes my boot hang (HP
Omnibook 6100, newest BIOS) with kernel-2.6.6. With acpi enabled it
needed "nolacpi" to come up. It would always just stop after the lines:
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326
ACPI: IRQ9 SCI: Edge set to Level Trigger.
    ACPI-0179: *** Warning: The ACPI AML in your computer contains
errors, please nag the manufacturer to correct it.
    ACPI-0182: *** Warning: Allowing relaxed access to fields; turn on
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG for details.
 Apparently the SuSE supplied 2.6.4-54.3 has that (or a similar) fix in
it, as the notebook boots fine with that.
 Only remaining problem now is that I have the "gut feeling" that I am
missing some mouse events with acpi enabled. That maybe XFree related.
Cheers
Martin
