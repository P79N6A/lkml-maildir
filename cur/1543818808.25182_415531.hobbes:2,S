I experimented with the idea of all architectures sharing the struct 
node_active_region rather than storing the information twice. It got very 
messy, particularly for x86 because it needs to store more than nid, 
start_pfn and end_pfn for a range of page frames (see node_memory_chunk_s 
in arch/i386/kernel/srat.c). Worse, some architecture-specific code 
remembers the ranges of active memory as addresses and others as pfn's. In 
the end, I was not too worried about having the information in two places, 
because the active ranges are kept in __initdata and gets freed.
I'll admit that for x86_64, the entire code path for initialisation (i.e. 
architecture specific and architecture independent paths) is now more 
complex. The architecture independent code needed to be able to handle 
every variety of node layout which is overkill for x86_64. Nevertheless, 
without size_zones(), I thought the architecture-specific code for x86_64 
memory initialisation was a bit easier to read. With 
architecture-independent zone size and hole calculation, you only have to 
understand the relevant code once, not once for each architecture.

What sort of library functions would you recommend? x86_64 uses 
add_active_range() and free_area_init_nodes() from this patchset which 
seemed fairly straight-forward.
