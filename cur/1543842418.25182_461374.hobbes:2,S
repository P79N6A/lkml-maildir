SpamCop uses it on their own mail service to flag messages as
potential spam and filter those out to a junk folder.
They also publish the list publicly.
So, SpamCop is blocking 0 emails.
As for third parties looking at their RBL, SpamCop specifically
recommends that the list *not* be used for blocking:

False permission is no permission at all. That's a widely recognised
concept; in law, life and the internet.

SMTP is growing up *right now*. The reconfig of servers to not send
unsolicted bounces/etc is part of the growing-up-ness.
The following fall into two categories:
> 1. No more bounce messages
> 4. No more deferral messages
Servers can be configed to not send these. To those whose systems are
set up in such a manner to require accepting the message before
delivery, to paraphrase Chase, "(2) Spammers would be responsible for
your misery, not the parties rejecting your bounces".

All of these should be sent by a human.

Yep. That's the growing up you were looking for earlier.
It looks like we disagree on the method of change required. That's
life.
