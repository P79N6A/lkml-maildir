Linus and Jonathan,
would you be so kind to make some noise about the reiserfs issue that
exists between c1eaa26 and 2f1169e?
Booting a kernel in that window results in a semi-broken reiserfs file
system (can boot but not build a new kernel etc.) and a fsck is needed
for complete restoration of consistency of fs. See also the original
report of the problem [1].
2.6.29-rc1 has the fix, but people like me that are doing bisections in
the 2.6.28..2.6.29-rc1 window are likely to run into the problem, and
should run something like the following after each git bisect bad/good
git rev-list HEAD | grep -q c1eaa26 && \
  (git rev-list HEAD | grep -q 2f1169e || git cherry-pick -n 2f1169e)
