I even had to "rdev -R /dev/hda1 " the kernel just to get it to find the 
root parttion it was erroring with
(3.1) unrecnised device i even had to down the 2.6.13 source just to try 
it the patch would not apply
to a 2.6.12.5 source code
I have seen swsusp work on this laptop I haven't even seen swsusp2 even 
boot
on the fastest computer I have acess to there is a 2 1/2 hour built of 
the kernel
and I have to remove the hard drive from the laptop install it in the 
desk top get
the kernel on it reflash the BIOSreset al the hard ware settings reset 
the clock
just to see the kernel crash on boot up I have done this 3 times I have 
doubts
that this patch was ever ment for laptops the doucmentation isen't even 
included
in the source package
(laptops are not always on the net or always easy to get on the net )
I see it as a good thing it hasen't ben included in the kernel tree
