I think the MD kernel modules certainly *could* be ported to the dev-mapper 
framework. But right now, from EVMS's standpoint, there is no need to force 
that change just yet. If it is determined in the future that that would be a 
better direction to go, for us it would just mean re-coding the user-space MD 
plugin to talk to dev-mapper instead of the MD driver. But a lot of work has 
gone into the MD driver during 2.5, so I would personally think such a change 
won't happen until at least 2.7.

The pretty much exactly what does/will happen, except EVMS will talk to the 
MD driver now (maybe DM in the future).
