You must also number the events. The illustration does not have enough
information to make a decision -
    what process issued the write
    which user is this
    what is the users current security permissions
    what are the current permissions on the file being written to
    what is the parent process (log information)
    when was the write started (log information)
    when was it approved/disapproved (log information)
    which event is being approved/disapproved
For some security models you must also have access to information on
what other files may be open.

Generic maybe - but not complete. This is a technique more suitable to debugging
not security.

Nope: ioctls are also used to read/write data (see the CD writer/reader for
examples)

nope: with multiple tracers you must syncronize the approvals. This requires
scanning the queue of not-yet-processed events to locate the event to approve
or disapprove.

batched yes - but not in a timely manner. There are too many events that have
some time coordination required - see audio recording/playback, CD writing,
RPC calls.

speedup yes - but you end up having to dedicate a CPU to handling the tracer.

Now you are duplicating the entire system. Consider what happens when a user
copies his directory tree to tape using tar... You copy the read... then you
copy the write..., and with the users actual request you have 3 times the
system load.

again - ioctls do transfer data and control information (CD readers/writers)

This is more suitable to debugging security problems with a single application
that it is a generic security module. It is too slow.
