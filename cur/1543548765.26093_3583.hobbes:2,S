BTW, any bug reports starting with "kernel is x.y.z + FOO42069 + K314 +
<long list of patches>" will be cheerfully flushed down the toilet here,
no matter what system of dependencies is going to be in place.
Even if dependencies will scale, testing/bug hunting won't. Anybody who
has doubts about it really ought to recall the situation with Minix
circa '91.
IOW, don't go overboard with the dependencies - number of simultaneous
patches translates into number of people that have to be involved in
any work on patched kernel and _that_ will give a bottleneck. Extra
generality is not going to do any good.
