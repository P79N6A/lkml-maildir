well, just for the archives, if anybody else needs that:
in /usr/lib/X11/xkb/keycodes/xfree86 change the <AE13> = 133; to <AE13>
= 245; and either run xmodmap -e 'keycodes 245 = 0x5c 0x7c' or add the
xmodmap in the .xinitrc
I don't have the keycode for the "close japanese bracket and long
hyphen", so it is just a fix/hack, so you can youse tha backslash / bar
key on a jp106 (japanese keyboard) with 2.6.0-test kernels
