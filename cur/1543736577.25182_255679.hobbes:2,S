Hi all,
Just out of interest then...suppose we've got a loopback swap device
and that we can extend this by creating a new file or extending
somehow the existing one.
What would be wrong with having the page reclaim algorithms use one of
the low memory watermarks as a trigger to call in to userspace to
extend the swap available if possible? This is probably what Microsoft
et al do with their "Windows is extending your virtual memory, yada
yada blah blah". Comments? Already done?
Jon.
