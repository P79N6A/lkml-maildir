  Since all the threads ( processes in Linux, though cloned and sharing same
  MM ) might be running at the time of core-dump in one of the threads,
  there is most likely possibility of the MM getting changed by the time
  the dump file is written. This is so because the other processes do not
  have any knowledge of one of the threads( cloned processes ) being dumped.
  Though the context ( registers etc ) at the time of dump for the thread 
  dumping core match the ones at theattime of dump , the data in the dump 
  will not reflect the MM data at that point in time for the above reason.
 thanks,
 Rama.
