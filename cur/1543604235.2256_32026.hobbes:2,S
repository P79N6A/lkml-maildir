I had mentioned even earlier, the same functionality can be obtained otherwise.
I was talking about porting from SUN, HP-UX, AIX, etc. I have had people coming
to me and telling me that SIOCGIFNUM (equivalent to SIOCGIFCOUNT) does not exist
and I have had to ask them to use SIOCGIFCONF, if ifc.ifc_len and ifc.ifc_buf set
to '0', to obtain the total size. Again, it is not a must it should be around.
But since the ioctl is there, it might be good to have it work the way some one
reading a man page would expect it to work, or if somebody wanted to port some
application from Sun, HP-UX or AIX would just do
#define SIOCGIFNUM SIOCGIFCOUNT
and get his application to compile without changing the code
