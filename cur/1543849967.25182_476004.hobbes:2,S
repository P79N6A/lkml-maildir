Ok I am getting lost in all of the mails here, so let me try to summaize
The existing cpuset code that partitioned sched domains at the
back of a exclusive cpuset has one major problem. Administrators
will find that tasks assigned to top level cpusets, that contain
child cpusets that are exclusive, can no longer be rebalanced across
the entire cpus_allowed mask.
This as far as I can tell is the only problem with the current code.
So I dont see why we need a major rewrite that involves a complete change
in the approach to the dynamic sched domain implementation.
I really think all we need is to have a new flag (say sched_domain)
that can be used by the admin to create a sched domain. Since this is
in addition to the cpu_exclusive flag, the admin realizes that the tasks
associated with the parent cpuset may need to be moved around to better
reflect the cpus that will actually run on. Thats it.
Can somebody tell me why this approach is not good enough ?
I am testing this patch currently and will post it shortly for review
