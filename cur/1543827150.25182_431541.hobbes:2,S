  I can understand that 10+ years old interface can be updated, or even redesigned,
 but when you buy the hardware you should be aware that it is not at all compatible
 (maybe some chipset only), so you can decide what to buy. If the spec of your
 hardware say that it is 100% compatible and the chipset do not implement its spec,
 you have a problem.
  It is mainly to increase the bandwidth of the pipe linking the hard disk to the
 memory, but anyway the hard disk cannot reach this bandwidth for ATA anyway (unless
 reading it own memory cache).
  And there is still the current hardware ATA + ATA disk to manage.

 If someone has write access to the MBR and the power supply, well he can destroy
 the system in so many ways. Note that if the hard disk has an IDE password
 that you know and that the disk is frozzen, your new boot block has to enter
 the known-by-you password first...
 Gujin cannot set an IDE password (use other utilities for that), but will ask
 you the password of locked hard disks (after keyboard mapping/language recognition)
 before probing them for partiton.
