Lee, et. all,
   Could this possibly be part of what is causing my xrun problems? I
had a huge rash of xruns yesterday. I seem to run into issues after
longer times of inactivity. I hadn't considered this possibility
before.
   Unfortunately I don't know how to fix this for SATA drives? hdparm
doesn't say much and sdparm gives me info I don't understand:
lightning ~ # hdparm /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 30401/255/63, sectors = 250059350016, start = 0
lightning ~ #
lightning ~ # sdparm /dev/sda
    /dev/sda: ATA       ST3250823AS       3.03
Read write error recovery mode page:
  AWRE        1  [ sav:  1]
  ARRE        1  [ sav:  1]
  PER         0  [ sav:  0]
Caching (SBC) mode page:
  WCE         1  [ sav:  1]
  RCD         0  [ sav:  0]
Control mode page:
  SWP         0  [ sav:  0]

Drive performance seems good:
lightning ~ # hdparm -tT /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   2200 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1100.12 MB/sec
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Inappropriate
ioctl for device
 Timing buffered disk reads:  198 MB in  3.03 seconds =  65.45 MB/sec
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Inappropriate
ioctl for device

I'm still waiting for someone to address the problem where I cannot
build 2.4.16-rc5-rt7 so this is on -rt3.
Thanks,
Mark
