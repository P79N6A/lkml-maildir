The "long term" fix for it went in instead (arch/i386/mm/pageattr.c)
The kernel is careful now to not create conflicting cache attributes
for AGP and other mappings.  This makes the linux kernel x86
conformant in this area.  It also increases performance on
Athlon XP/MP because they can now use large pages in kernel space again.
