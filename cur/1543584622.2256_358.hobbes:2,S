Greetings, and thank you so much for your helpful reply!  Was this on
an i386?  I'm specifically looking for a way to do his on arm, alpha,
and sparc, and I don't believe they have the cr2 member of struct
sigcontext.  Any info you might have, including where you found this
solution, would be appreciated!
Take care,
