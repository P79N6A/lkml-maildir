It's described in LDD2 and other books, but the traditional view is
still that one device node in /dev refers to an actual device or
at least something that acts like a device (e.g. /dev/null, dev/tty).

It does what you expect. Since spufs is mounted, 'ls /spu/' shows you
the existing spu contexts, 'lsof /spu/*' shows you the tasks using those.
