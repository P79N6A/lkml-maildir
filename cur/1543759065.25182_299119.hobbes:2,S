Well, since I'd pull basically all the time, all the patches _do_ get 
testing the the -rc kernels. 
But the rules would be that small patches can also be verified 
independently.
And realize that the 2.6.x tree doesn't "change" any way. It doesn't get 
more unruly just because we have a side tree that is being anal about 
things. It's still as stable as it ever is..
