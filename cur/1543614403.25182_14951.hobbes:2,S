Hi,
For some months now, I have been working on a read-only implementation 
of the BeOS's native filesystem (BeFS). I just released version 0.6, and 
I think it works pretty darn well. <
http://befs-driver.sourceforge.net/>
I've had some reports of it working well on other peoples' machines as 
well. So what I'd really like now is for more people to try and break 
it. If you have a Be filesystem partition, please try it out. If you 
don't (but still feel like testing anyway), the download page has a 
filesystem image you can try it out on.
I'd also appreciate anyone who wants to critique the code itself. Thanks!
