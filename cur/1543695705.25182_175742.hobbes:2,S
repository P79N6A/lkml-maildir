Hello!
Are there any FAQs for tuning Linux 2.6 on Transmeta 5600 cpus?
I got an EGS Elitebook A530 and want to fine tune it as good as
possible.
Additionally I am not able to view battery status, as the computer seems
to have no apm and acpi doesn't display the battery status
(/proc/../battery is empty).
Thanks in advance,
Nico
