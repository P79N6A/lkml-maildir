What do you mean by overlapping?
fadvise(fd, 100, 200, FADV_WRITE_ASYNC);
fadvise(fd, 300, 400, FADV_WRITE_ASYNC);
fadvise(fd, 100, 200, FADV_WRITE_SYNC);
fadvise(fd, 300, 400, FADV_WRITE_SYNC);
Will do exactly the same as Andrew's
fadvise(fd, 100, 200, FADV_ASYNC_WRITE);
fadvise(fd, 300, 400, FADV_ASYNC_WRITE);
fadvise(fd, 100, 200, FADV_WRITE_WAIT);
fadvise(fd, 300, 400, FADV_WRITE_WAIT);

Yeah they do differ but if you are using sync writes then you obviously
have some data integrity requirements and you _know_ who is writing to
your file and when. That's my point. You're thinking kernel mode. The
userspace requirement for sync writes is "this has reached backing store".

_You_ do, yes. You are a kernel hacker. You implement synchonous writes.
Implementing synchronous writes is what you do.
Userspace does not care. They use synchronous writes to guarantee it has
hit backing store. They've managed quite nicely up until now without having
your implementation details exposed to them (when is a page dirty? when is
it "under writeout"? who cares? I just want to know if it is on backing
store or not).

It is just as easy as WRITE_WAIT to do both. In the pollable case you
just need another flag to say you don't want to block, same as would
be required for WRITE_WAIT.
Seems like you're clutching for straws here.

I was still talking about new additions to fadvise here, not the msync stuff.
