Well, I wrote in my first mail:

I'd like to have -o union work not just on ext2/3.  It could  
potentially be
very _slow_ on other filesystems, until they get nonresident file  
support,
but it would definitely need to be an interruptible page copy in that  
case.

Precisely.

Hmm.  Ideally a program like tar would be able to determine which  
pages of
a file are resident in memory and only store those.  How does this  
currently
work for sparse files?

Definitely.  You'd only need to set this if there were any  
nonresident files,
however, and those would probably only be created if you union  
mounted with
"-o nonres" or similar.

I'm just describing the whole idea in totality, so that everybody can  
get an
idea of what's going on.

I liked the idea of the existing linux sparse file support, so I  
based it off
that.

For ext2/ext3, the sparse-file-support _does_ exist, so the only  
major parts
that need to be added are:
     o An extra ext2/ext3 flag that indicates nonresidence (For both  
sparse
       files, normal files, and directories).
     o VFS-level support for the union operation with hooks to let each
       filesystem do something special.
