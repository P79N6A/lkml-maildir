I have a bit of a problem. Whenever I rip a cd onto my disk my modem link
slows nearly to a halt. I have an IDE HD and CD-ROM and am using
cdparanoia but I don't imagine it's a program problem but more a kernel
problem. My modem is a 56K and it doesn't _seem_ to effect the network
link I have to a second computer in my house (NIC). Using cdparanoia takes
up 13% CPU (there abouts).
Any suggestions/ideas/comments?
Thanks,
 -- Roddy
