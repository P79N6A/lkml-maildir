While I'm not an expert hacker or anything, I can tell you for sure,
that even 2.4.2 is full of really system crippling bugs.  You need to
track the current kernels.  All of the 2.4.x series should be
compatible, in other words, you should upgrade as soon as possible to
the latest stable kernel.  Currently, that's 2.4.3 (not 2.4.2).  And
even 2.4.3 has many known bugs that are capable of 1) destroying
performance and 2) destroying filesystems.  
At the very least, you should upgrade to 2.4.3, but better yet would be
to upgrade to the 2.4.4 when it comes out (soon?), or even the 2.4.4-pre
patch since it has the zero copy networking patch already included, as
well as fixes for bugs that could corrupt your filesystems.  The zero
copy patch as it existed for 2.4.0 was also buggy in itself, so that
would explain some of your extended problems.
Really, 2.4.0 is a 'horrible' kernel to be running, as it is missing an
enormous amount of performance fixes, and bug fixes.
