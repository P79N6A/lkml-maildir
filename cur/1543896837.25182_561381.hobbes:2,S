Hi, Paul,
Bytes are too fine grained. Do we also accept the input in bytes? kB
are probably the best, but then with the limit set to LONG_MAX, kB
wrap around (if the input is in units of pages) on 64 bit machines
(the sameapplies to bytes as well).
The problem with input in bytes is that the user will have to ensure
that the input is
a  multiple of page size, which implies that she would need to use the
calculator every time.
