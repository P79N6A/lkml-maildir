     On Cisco routers, yes, which are most certainly NOT Unix machines.
     ifconfig and route, on the other hand, are pretty common;  that's
     why I'm mot, umm, ``upgrading'' my network utilities to use ip --
     I like to not have to have my brain hurt too much when switching
     from one Unix box to another.

      Most Linices *do* do it automatically from within their respective
      rc.network scripts, and people have mentioned places where it's
      useful to bring up an interface but not attach any routes to it
      when they're doing something fancier than simply attaching a
      workstation to a network.

	david parsons \bi/ I think I prefer Linux to be a Unix clone instead
                       \/                                    of an IOS clone.
