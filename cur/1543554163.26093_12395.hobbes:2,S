Odd.  There is nothing in de_still_valid that should panic, unless there is
some major memory corruption going on.  Do you always get the same trace?

Once you get inside reiserfs_rename, you've started a transaction.  If you
oops inside there, the transaction never finishes, and all the other
transactions end up waiting on it.  So, if you can continue without hanging
the box, the oops didn't happen in reiserfs_rename ;-)  Could you send a
decoded version?
