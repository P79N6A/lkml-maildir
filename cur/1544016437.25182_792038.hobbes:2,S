I think you do need open; how else will you open the serial port?
The best advice I can offer is: Don't think about kernel threads,
user-space is where you should be; and don't think about removing system
calls.  If your application truly is so tight, linux might not be the
right tool for you.
Maybe the embedded linux list might be more in tune with what you're
thinking.
