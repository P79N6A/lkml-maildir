The thing is, the current code is _worse_. 
MUCH worse.
And it's worse exactly because it does things really wrong. The suggested
patch then just _continues_ to do things really wrong, and then tries to
paper over the bugs.
Which is why I refuse to apply it. Use a pid and do it right.
If the code cannot be made to use fasync itself, then it can at least be
made to do the same _checks_ that fasync does (easy enough: just save away
uid/euid, and do the same signal checks by hand). Until such a time than
the driver writer sees the light.
