Looks great.  I briefly had visions of some bitfield to pack the three
boolean ints we have and then quickly came to my senses. :)
I threw together those other two patches that work with ranges around
direct IO.  (unmaping before r/w and writing and waiting before reads).
 rc3-mm1 is angry with my test machine so they're actually against
current -bk with this first invalidation patch applied.  I hope that
doesn't make life harder than it needs to be.  I'll send them under
seperate cover.
