FE = framing error, which is an error which is solely detected by the
hardware when the stop bit(s) are not the mark value.  They can appear
when the wrong parity setting, number of stop bits, or baud rate is
programmed.
If you were overruning the serial port FIFOs, then you would see "oe"
errors.
What baud rate are you trying to run the link at?
