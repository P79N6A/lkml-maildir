Hmm, ok for the event notification we would need a nice interface. Still
have my doubts a file descriptor is the best way to do this though.

First system calls are not that slow on Linux. Measure it.

I think you optimize the wrong thing here.
There are basically two cases I see:
-  Global measurement of lots of things:
Things are slow anyways with large context switch overheads. The 
overheads are large anyways. Doing one or more system calls probably
does not matter much. Most important is a clean interface.
- Exact measurement of the current process. For that you need very
low latencies. Any system call is too slow. That is why CPUs have
instructions like RDPMC that allow to read those registers with
minimal latency in user space. Interface should support those.
Also for this case programming time does not matter too much. You
just program once and then do RDPMC before code to measure and then
afterwards and take the difference. The actual counter setup is out 
of the latency critical path.

Setting period should be a separate call. Mixing the two together into one
 does not look like a nice interface.

I didn't object to providing the initial value -- my example had that.
Just having a separate concept of data registers seems too complicated to me.
You should just pass event types and values and the kernel gives you
a register number.

And?  You didn't say what the advantage of that is? 
All the approaches add context switch latencies. It is not clear that the separate
session setup helps it all that much.

What is the use case of this? Do users use that?

Well the system call layer can manage that transparently with a little software state
(counter). No need to expose it.

Hmm? RDPMC is 64bit.

I disagree. Using RDPMC is essential for at least some of the things I would like
to do with perfmon2. If the interface does not provide it it is useless to me at least.
System calls are far too slow for cycle measurements. 
And when RDPMC is already supported it should be as widely used as possible.
Regarding the portable code problem: of course you would have some header in user space
that hides the details in a hopefully portable macro.

I think only supporting global and self monitoring as first step is totally fine.
All the bells'n'whistles can be added later if users really want them.

Sure at some point a system call for the more complex cases (also like multiplexing) would
be needed. But I don't think we need it as first step. The goal would be to define a 
simple subset that is actually mergeable.

I asked your noisy user base to specify more concrete use cases, but so far
they have not provided anything except rather vacuous complaints. Short of that I'll stick 
with what I know currently.

Well your "broad view" resulted in a incredible mess of interface moloch to be honest.
I really think we need a fresh start examining many of the underlying assumptions.
Regarding itanium: I suppose it could provide a RDPMC replacement using your 
fast priviledged vsyscalls.
