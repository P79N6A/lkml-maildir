Yes and no.  As I understand it, AHCI's capability is an automatic 
version of what standard SATA phys provide manually.  In AHCI's case, 
the hardware automatically manages the link power, possibly cycling it 
hundreds of times per second.  In the standard case, software must 
determine when a different power state is appropriate based on current 
conditions, and update the phy appropriately.
