My guess is that this has nothing to do with the USB controller, other 
than the fact that IRQ 217 is enabled because the controller uses it.  
Probably the real problem, the unhandled interrupt requests, comes from 
some other device entirely.

It is.  Without knowing the underlying cause of the problem, it's the best 
I can suggest.
If you compare /proc/interrupts with earlier versions of the kernel (where 
the problem doesn't occur), does it look the same?
