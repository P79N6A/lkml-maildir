From a performance and readability PoV, the following idiom is generally
preferred:
	static int open_foo(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
	{
		int retval;
		MOD_INC_USE_COUNT;
		retval = -EBUSY;
		if (request_irq(FOO_IRQ, foo_interrupt, 0, "FOO", NULL))
			goto fail;
		return 0;
	fail:
		MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
		return retval;
	}
This keeps the failure (uncommon) case out of the normal path and ensures
that _all_ failing calls call MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT.  I'm quite a big fan of
`only two return statements per function' because it allows for easier
printk-based debugging.  Oh, and it drives the anti-goto fanatics wild,
so it's also worthwhile.
