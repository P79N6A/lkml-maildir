The specifics do not matter.  It does not even have to do what we want
by default when you paste or insert text.  There just has to be SOME way
(well, some reasonable way - a global config option is not reasonable)
to insert a text file and paste from the clipboard as-is, no tab->space
conversion, no line wrapping, nothing.
