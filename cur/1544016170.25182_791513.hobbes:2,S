I'd have expected to see stat() returning -EOVERFLOW, but it isn't there.
googling around a bit seems to indcate that this might be a glibc issue:
http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1864
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=146951
But the traces are all using stat64() and fstat64().  And why would it
just start occurring now?
