I've just experienced a very similar situation: I/O error, journal abort, 
partition went read-only. Maybe it's completely unrelated, but by chance, 
do you have some clipping jumper set on this disk so you depend on the 
ide-stroke feature?
In my case this was the culprit. It's a 120GB disk in a box with old 
crashing Award BIOS, so I've clipped it to 32GB. However I've missed the 
fact since about 2.6.7 one has to set hda=stroke kernel parameter in order 
to get the host protected area disabled. Therefore partitions starting 
behind 32GB failed to mount.
In contrast, the partition which crosses the 32GB barrier was mounted 
succesfully but later when trying to access beyond the limit I was seeing:
ide0: reset: success
hda: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
hda: read_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=110291109, high=6, low=9627813, sector=110291109
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hda, sector 110291109
EXT3-fs error (device hda7): ext3_get_inode_loc: unable to read inode block - inode=3883009, block=7766022
Aborting journal on device hda7.
ext3_abort called.
EXT3-fs error (device hda7): ext3_journal_start: Detected aborted journal
Remounting filesystem read-only
Adding the hda=stroke kernel parameter solved the issue - forced fsck 
showed no damage happened to the fs.
HTH,
Martin
