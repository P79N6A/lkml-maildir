Strange to put a lock around an atomic op like that.
Sometimes it's valid.   If another cpu was doing:
	spin_lock(lock);
	if (test_bit(IPOIB_MCAST_STARTED))
		something();
	...
	if (test_bit(IPOIB_MCAST_STARTED))
		something_else();
	spin_unlock(lock);
then the locked set_bit() makes sense.
But often it doesn't ;)
