it's not just usb_set_interface that hangs actually.
It seems to hang at
wait_event(usb_kill_urb_queue, atomic_read(&urb->use_count) == 0);
in drivers/usb/core/urb.c after resuming. I disabled access to the usb
subsystem in the uvc driver, although connecting any other usb storage
fails too, just at the same point.
The hardware is:
00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6
Family) USB UHCI #1 (rev 04) (8086:2658)
