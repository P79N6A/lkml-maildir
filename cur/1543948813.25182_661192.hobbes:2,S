Yes, that is a tiny bit tricky (need to call put_unused_fd() if you
don't install the fd).

I think that may be a bit cleaner than Al's approach, but it still
leaves the same trap that create_vcpu_fd() falls into.  The current
code is:
static int create_vcpu_fd(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
	int fd, r;
	struct inode *inode;
	struct file *file;
	r = anon_inode_getfd(&fd, &inode, &file,
			     "kvm-vcpu", &kvm_vcpu_fops, vcpu);
	if (r)
		return r;
	atomic_inc(&vcpu->kvm->filp->f_count);
	return fd;
}
and with your proposal, the natural way to write that becomes:
static int create_vcpu_fd(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
{
	int fd, r;
	r = anon_inode_getfd(&fd, NULL,
			     "kvm-vcpu", &kvm_vcpu_fops, vcpu);
	if (r)
		return r;
	atomic_inc(&vcpu->kvm->filp->f_count);
	return fd;
}
which still has the same bug.
Maybe a good way to handle this is just to make the get_file() not
optional.  I dunno... I feel like we've spent more discussion on this
point than it deserves, so someone should just make a decision and
I'll adapt the ib_uverbs code to work with whatever it is.
