I guess the downside to this is if a reader is reading a large file, or
several files, sequentially with a small read size (smaller than
PAGE_SIZE), the pages will be marked active after just one read pass.
My gut says the benefits of this patch outweigh the cost.  I would
expect real-world backup apps, etc. to read at least PAGE_SIZE.
