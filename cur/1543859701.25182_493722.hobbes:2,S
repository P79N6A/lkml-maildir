CMI8330 (and also CMI8329) appears like SB16 and WSS

The mixer is a bit weird - and probably different between CMI8329 and CMI8330. 
At least on my CMI8329A, the master volume does not work. And there are also 
some problems with PCM volume - I can decrease it in alsamixer but not 
increase - but it works both ways in XMMS...
I have also some boards with integrated CMI8330 - so I might test it 
sometimes.
