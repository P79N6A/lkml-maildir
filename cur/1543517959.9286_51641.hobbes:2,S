I saw the same problem with an older Seagate drive here.  A Barracuda
ST15150W just would not work on a 7890-based controller under any of
Doug's newer drivers.  If I reverted back to the driver of circa-2.2.9 (I
think it was aic7xxx 5.1.10) it was just fine.  This only occurred on a
7890 controller.  The drive's previous home was in an older box with 2940A
controller (7880 chipset), where it worked (and continues to work) fine.
