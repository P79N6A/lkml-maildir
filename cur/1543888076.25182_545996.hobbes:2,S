I think it's pretty clear that Dave and Daniel were both correct and
that ACPI_PROCESSOR is the correct dependency for multi-socket systems.
However, it's worth noting that this dependency seems to be unrelated to
SMP support.  Ed Sweetman has reported that his single-socket but
multi-core system doesn't require ACPI_PROCESSOR for powernow support.
I just tried booting 2.6.21 w/o SMP support and w/o ACPI_PROCESSOR on
one of my multi-socket/multi-core systems.  Sure enough, powernow 
won't work without ACPI_PROCESSOR:
powernow-k8: Found 1 Dual-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 2220 processors (version 2.00.00)
powernow-k8: BIOS error - no PSB or ACPI _PSS objects
I suppose this means that the BIOS does something different to enable
SMP on a multi-core single socket and multi-socket systems.  Anyways, I
believe the question that needs to be answered is: is it reasonable for
X86_POWERNOW_K8 to select ACPI_PROCESSOR if SMP is set?  I'm not sure we
can do anything more intelligent unless Kconfig had more knowledge of
how the hardware other than just SMP/!SMP.
