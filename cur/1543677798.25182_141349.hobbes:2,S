I re-run the many fsx tests with feral driver on 2.5.70mm9, ext3
fileystems, on deadline scheduler and as scheduler respectively.  Both
tests passed.  They were running for more than 24 hours without any
problems. So it could be a bug in the device driver that I used
before(QLA2xxx V8).  Before the fsx tests failed on ext3 on either
deadline scheduler or as scheduler.
Thanks for your time and help on tracing down this problem. :)
