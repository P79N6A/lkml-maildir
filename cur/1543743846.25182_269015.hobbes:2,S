IMNSHO, str* functions have no business in arbitrary data. I have a
simple memstr() function in bogofilter that is GPL'd and can be imported
into the kernel, I believe:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/
*checkout*/bogofilter/bogofilter/src/memstr.c?rev=HEAD
Yes, there is room for optimization, but as long as strstr isn't
optimized, who cares.
