Haven't had latency problems, to be honest.  Maybe I should start playing mp3s
while I code?
1) conditional_schedule?  Hmmm... Why the __set_current_state?  I think I prefer
   an explicit "if (need_schedule()) schedule()", with
   #define need_schedule() unlikely(current->need_resched)
2) I hate condsched.h: Use sched.h please!
3) Why this:

Other than that, I like this patch.  Linus?
