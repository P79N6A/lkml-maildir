When i start X on a 2.2.x kernel (including 2.2.2-pre2) it will hang after a 
short while and continue when i move the mouse. X stays in 
fail_down_interruptable until the mouse is moved.
I saw the same behaviour in another program, stracing that showed 
/dev/mouse (symlink to /dev/ttyS1) was opened nonblocking, and at the point 
where the program hangs it is doing a read on the mouse fd.
I have a serial mouse, and it works fine in 2.1.132
