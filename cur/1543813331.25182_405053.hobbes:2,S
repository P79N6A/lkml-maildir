Not for reads AFAICT - __generic_file_aio_read + own-locking
should always have released i_mutex at the end of the direct
read - are you thinking of writes or have I missed something?

Er, eek?  Hopefully thats not needed - from my reading of the
code, all the i_mutex locking for direct reads lives inside
direct-io.c, not filemap.c -- is the solution from my other
mail not workable?  (isn't it only writes that has the wierd
buffered I/O fallback + i_sem/i_mutex locking interaction?).
thanks.
