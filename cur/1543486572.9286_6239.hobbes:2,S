Sorry Richard, all you have proved is that /proc/net/route does not
display all the information from the kernel routing tables.  The
internal fib holds more data than either the route command or
/proc/net/route show to the user.  The kernel internals have changed
but the user interface is lagging behind.
Is that a bug?  Perhaps.  But the bug (if any), is not the existence of
duplicate routing table entries.  Instead it is the user interface that
makes different kernel entries look like duplicates.  So patches to the
kernel route up/down code are the wrong approach, fix the user
interfaces instead.  Or use the newer tools - iproute, ipaddr.
