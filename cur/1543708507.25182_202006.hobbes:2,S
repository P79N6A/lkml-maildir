Where we are upto:
The machine below starts producing slab corruption errors when the amount of RAM is
3GB or more.
The hardware has been check and it does not appear to be a hardware error, additional
hardware that was producing different errors was removed and the slab corruption
persisted.
The driver that seems to be triggering the error is the eepro100. And only when receiving
data, transmitting data produces no errors. 
the test was 
 send kern-image A -> B, no errors.
 send kern-image B -> A, errors.
A being the itanium
Using the alternative Intel e100 driver removes the slab corruption errors.
A small modification to 'struct skb_shared_info' that places an int before the 
'atomic_t dataref' field removes the slab corruption errors.
