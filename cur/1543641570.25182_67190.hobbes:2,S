	Ok, I'll forward...
	hch@lst.de (or whoever did that) :
	1) I don't really think that a wireless driver will get much
benefit from ethtool (try setting full duplex ;-)
	2) Headers are added in the file wavelan_cs.h, to keep
wavelan.c clean and tidy. And this would have avoided the bug.
	3) It take only 2 second to try to compile before submitting
your changes. Even the best of us do it.
	4) A MAINTAINER is not someone that clean up after the mess of
other people. I usually answer my e-mail, and I could have both answer
your question and reviewed the patch.
	So, please clean up your mess...
	Jean
