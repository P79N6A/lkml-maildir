That is exactly the wrong answer. What is needed is to address the _data_
on the disk, not it's ephemeral phyiscal location. Worse yet, having to
become acquainted with esotherica like "controller all way down to
partition". OTOH, if you take a look at current versions of mount(8), you
_can_ mount by volume identifier and don't need all this nonsense at all.
