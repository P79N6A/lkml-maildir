This smells. Denying access to root doesn't make any sense. I agree
that it could help in some corner cases (like avoiding automated backup
from backing up user filesystems), but in the end it's going to be
an annoyance.
Per-user namespaces (set up by PAM) look as a very reasonable solution.
				Have a nice fortnight
