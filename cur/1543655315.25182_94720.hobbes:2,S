It needs padding _only_ on SMP.  ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp.
#define offsetof(t, m)  ((int)(&((t *)0)->m))
struct foo {
        int a;
        int b __attribute__((__aligned__(1024)));
        int c;
} foo;
main()
{
        printf("%d\n", sizeof(struct foo));
        printf("%d\n", offsetof(struct foo, a));
        printf("%d\n", offsetof(struct foo, b));
        printf("%d\n", offsetof(struct foo, c));
}
./a.out
2048

So your patch will do what you want it to do.  You should just tag the
first member of a group with ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp, and keep an
eye on things with offsetof().
Not sure why sizeof() returned 2048 though.
