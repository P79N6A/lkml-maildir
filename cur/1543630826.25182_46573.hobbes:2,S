Are there workarounds to avoid this problem?
What does it take to trigger the corruption?
I ask this because I have used a degraded raid5 because the source drive
would become a member, but I needed to copy the data first.  While doing so,
I had to reboot a couple times to reconfigure the boot loader.  All seems to
be working fine on the system today though.
Thanks,
Mike
