Subject: SCSI scanner problem with all kernels since 2.3.42

I'm having problems with using xsane to acquire a preview from an HP
ScanJet 5P connected to an AHA-2940.  2.3.42 is the last kernel that
works right for me.
The symptom is that the scanner starts to make scanning sounds, then
stops, and xsane says 'Error during read: Error during device I/O'.
Any ideas?
Tim.
