Ok.  I see it now.  The REMOVE_LINKS/SET_LINKS deep in __ptrace_link()
touching the task list is sneaky.

I see one of two possibilities.
- Either there is a magic invariant that is supposed to be preserved
  about always being on the task list with a parent.
  (And the code in this part of exec is already broken).
- Or the code is just being inefficient.
A corollary is why is any of this code safe to run without holding
the tasklist_lock?
