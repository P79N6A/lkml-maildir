I guess I just don't really see the point of moving the code around like
this.  Before, it would have been easier to tell at a glance before
whether you were looking at 32 or 64-bit code because of which file you
are in.  But, now, you need to look for #ifdef context.  I'm not sure
that's a win.
This only saves 5 net lines of code, and those are probably from:
-#ifndef __ARCH_I386_PERCPU__
-#define __ARCH_I386_PERCPU__
right?
The rest of the set looks brilliant, though.
