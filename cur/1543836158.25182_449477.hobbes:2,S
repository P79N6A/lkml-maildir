There was posts awhile ago about optimizing the kernel performance by
loading it at a 4MB offset.  
http://www.lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/23/189
Your changes breaks that on i386 (not aligned on a 4MB boundary).  But a
5MB offset works.  Is that the correct update or does that break the
original idea?
Cheers,
Don
