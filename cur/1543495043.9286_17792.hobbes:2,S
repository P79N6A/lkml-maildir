hi!
i have received a compaq proliant 1600 server that comes with two disk
adapters. one ncr83c875 to boot from and one called:
 Bus  0, device  14, function  0:
    System peripheral: Compaq Unknown device (rev 0).
      Vendor id=e11. Device id=a0f0.
      Medium devsel.
      I/O at 0x1800 [0x1801].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xc6efef00 [0xc6efef00].
in /proc/pci.
there are drivers for compaq fibrechannel adapters available, alas i do
not know anything about the state of those drivers or who maintains them. 
so please tell me anything you know about those
drivers/controllers/systems ASAP -- our linux operations depend on this.
