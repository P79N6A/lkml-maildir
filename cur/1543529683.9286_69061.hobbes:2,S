Lilo can not find itself on the boot. It means: kernel and BIOS disagree on
BIOS geometry. If you can trash your disk then easiest way is to erase
partition table (with dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<your disk> bs=512 count=1)
and then use DOS'S fdisk to create partitions -- DOS will use information
from BIOS and Linux will use information from partition table (and then
in Linux's fdisk just change type of partitions do not make partitions itself
with plain fdisk -- not that #$^#%^%&*&(*#$ Disk Druid). It it's not an option
you can play with LiLo settings (there a lot of interesting settings for such
cases).
