That would require we could detect rambus memory 8)
	printk("Warning %dGb of %sram won't be used.\n", lost>>10,
rambus()?"expensive ");
But yes more seriously it would be a lot more useful and more
meaningful to tell people how much ram is not being used

It varies, it can cost you 5-10%. The bigger hit is that most 
I/O devices can't reach that memory directly from PCI space
so you get bounce buffer costs and more paging/vm management
overhead.
