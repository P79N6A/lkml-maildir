w/o the patch the nmi is delivered to cpu0 only, on HT watchdog on cpu1
has never been enabled afaics.

I think you didn't load any cpu for this test, the problem is confusing
because nmi_watchdog=2 use performance counter which doesn't count when
the processor is halted, on HT we use only one counter. If both processor
are halted performance monitoring shutdown and no longer tick, that's
why a cat /proc/interrupts && sleep 1 && cat /proc/interrupts look
like to work at something like one hz, there is always a few load...

w/o my patch you can get 1000 NMI per sec too. Load at least
one cpu.

I didn't look the IO APIC but I don't think we can (aren't we using the
same timer source to tick irq0 and the NMI so we need really 1000 hz I
guess :)

I'm unhappy with my solution for now.
What do you think about the feature "the performance doesn't increment
counter in hlt mode". afaics there is no way on Ppro/P4/K7/K8 to get
a real "count each cycle w/o regarding hlt mode". It's a real problem
if a driver rather than deadlocking a cpu do a halt with interrupt
disabled, int this that'll stop performance counter and NMI will never
occur... Is it a real problem ?
oh and the side effect of this feature: during idle time and if we
implement 1 NMI per sec we will get rouglhy 2 or 3 NMI per hour.

Phil
