Hmm, careful. There are a bunch of people who use suspend2 exactly
because it saves and restores the page cache, leaving the system in a
usable state without waiting for the universe to swap back in from
disk. It makes a big difference on older laptops with slow drives.
While the other advantages you list for process cryogenics are pretty
neat, let's remember that the 99% use case for STD is laptops.
