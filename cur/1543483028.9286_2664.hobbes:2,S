I saw this patch in Linux 2.2.0. But I don't think it is all correct.
Everytime when my NFS client mounts the server, the NFS server 
complaints
nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 35!
nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 36!
nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 20!
nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 21!
nfsd: RC_REPLSTAT/reply len 26!
Any ideas? BTW, do you have a testcase for the bug you tried to fix?
Thanks.
