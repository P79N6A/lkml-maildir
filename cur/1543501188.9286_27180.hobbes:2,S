knfsd's socket 2049 gets stuck with 64288 bytes in the recv-Q. I can
unload/reload the module, but I can't get knfsd to start because it says the
port is in use. 
udp    64288      0 0.0.0.0:2049            0.0.0.0:*
off (0.00/0/0)
osiris:# rpc.nfsd 
nfssvc: Address already in use
Is there any way to fix this without rebooting?
