Yes, truly this should be done.  Sensible defaults should be used (and I
think we may be at that point) and then use .Xdefaults (.Xresources or
whatever) to allow site overrides.  And I really do think .Xdefaults and
not .xconfigrc or something.  I've already got enough .files and I like
the syntax of .Xdefaults.
