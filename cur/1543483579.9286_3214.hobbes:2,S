	ZD-Net's not all bad.  They have one up that LinuxWorld refered to as
"Linux wins in a benchmark against NT".
	
http://www.zdnet.com/sr/stories/issue/0,4537,387506,00.html
	Reads like a Linux kicks ass and takes names type article.  Pretty
good up there...
	I like this paragraph from one of the charts:
] You might think that Linux would operate at a disadvantage here,
] but Linux kicks NT's butt. Only at the lightest loads does NT hold
] any advantage over the Linuxes. Once the load moves to 12 clients,
] all the Linux platforms take commanding leads over NT. At 32
] clients, SuSE, the weakest Linux, has more than double NT's
] throughput, and Red Hat, the leader, extends its lead to almost 250
] percent of NT's performance.
	This is all UP stuff though...  No SMP involved...
