Also gcc traditionally didn't do a very good job using it (this
might be better in the very latest versions). At least some of the 3.x
often discarded this information.

It's more than just HPC  -- a lot of code has critical loops.

Very little I suspect. Also the optimizations that gcc does with this
often increase the code size. While that can be a win, with people
judging gcc's output apparently *ONLY* on the code size as seen
in this thread[1] it would obviously not compete well.

than gcc at its best.
