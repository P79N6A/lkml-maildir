Subject: [PATCH] EHCI: turn off remote wakeup during shutdown
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/13/255

This patch (as850b) disables remote wakeup (and everything else!) on
all EHCI ports when the shutdown() method is called.  If remote wakeup
is left active then some systems will reboot instead of powering off.
This fixes Bugzilla #7828.

I'm submitting this for 2.6.20.stable.  The problem it addresses can occur
with earlier kernels, but not unless the user explicitly enables remote
wakeup by doing a runtime suspend of the EHCI root hub.  In 2.6.20 the
root hub will autosuspend itself, enabling remote wakeup and thus
triggering the problem.
A slightly different version of this patch will be submitted separately
for Greg KH's USB development tree.
