Subject: 2.2.0-pre7 good behavior but... weird messages in dmesg

Is this usual or should I worry???
[root@beta /root]# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr
1083555 14
[root@beta /root]# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
8192
also I have following in my dmesg:
Process: safe_mysqld (stack=db035f7c, task=db034000)
[<c010c989>] [<c0108d71>]
swap_duplicate at   735702: entry 00735702, unused page
swap_duplicate at   164304: entry 00164304, unused page
swap_duplicate at   4fba00: entry 004fba00, unused page
The box is dual PII-300 with 512MG of RAM and 102GB of raid10 (gdth) and
it's just being stress tested right now - (a lot of rsyncs, continuous
kernel recompilation, NFS server abuse, etc.)
BTW: besides that it looks good - it managed to stay up for 2 days, with
continuous load avg. 20-30 and peaks of 50-60 - no sign of anything bad
going on so far.
