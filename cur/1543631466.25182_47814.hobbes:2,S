Note, that errors are only appearing on hdb (barracuda drive),
but errors go away once I disable DMA on hda (IBM drive).
So the DMA is apparently is still on.
Hm, or is there some trick that if only one drive on the channel
operates in DMA mode and second on in PIO mode, then everything resorts to PIO
of some sort? But hdparm seems not to confirm that.

BTW, that's
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6
Usually I see something like this:
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hdb: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
... (some such messages) ... followed by:
hdb: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: DMA disabled
ide0: reset: success
Since this point, no more error messages.
I checked and hdb is actually in DMA mode at this point.
Hm, I also noticed that hdb have this setting:
 I/O support  =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
Never saw this before. 
Bye,
