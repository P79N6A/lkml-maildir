could you check out the 2.6.15-rc7 version of the latency tracer i 
uploaded to:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/latency-tracing-patches/
could test it by e.g. trying to reproduce the same VM latency as in the 
-rt tree. [the two zlib patches are needed if you are using 4K stacks, 
mcount increases stack footprint.]
