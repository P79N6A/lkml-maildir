Linus,
The following patch corrects problems with the I/O access and virtual/bus
translation macros in "linux/include/asm-i386/io.h".  Specifically, the default
value of PAGE_OFFSET hides the underlying problems that kernels built with
PAGE_OFFSET values such as 0x7000000 as mentioned in page.h will fail due to
two errors:
(1) The identity phys_to_virt(virt_to_phys(x)) == x is violated.
(2) The readb/writeb/readw/writew/readl/writel macros are completely incorrect
    since they are supposed to be applied to memory mapped I/O regions
    allocated with ioremap, but ioremap returns a kernel virtual address
    and hence no further mapping is appropriate.
The BusLogic driver ran into (1) and the DAC960 driver ran into (2).  With the
patch enclosed below, both drivers work fine when PAGE_OFFSET is changed.  The
change to traps.c is also necessary as readl was incorrect usage, even though
the modified code is now uglier.  If this construct is actually needed often
enough to warrant it, we should create macros such as readl_phys.
