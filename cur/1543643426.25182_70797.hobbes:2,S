I'm running 2.4.20-pre5 + ac3 + preemptible.
The kernel panicked when I tried to install a RPM file
from an IDE CDRW writer drive.  I tried merely copying
a file from the CD writer -- that panicked too.
What is peculiar about my PC is that it has two IDE CD drives:
CDRW and CDR (and it is dual x86).
The panic is reproducible, and doesn't appear on kernel 2.4.8
nor when I use the CDR (read-only) drive.
