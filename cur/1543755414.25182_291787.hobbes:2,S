Hi, guys,
I was looking at this:
  
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=138892
  I have added usb-handoff as a kernel option in grub.conf for
  2.4.21-20.EL (smp) and re-enabled USB Emulation and Controller in the
  BIOS, and the machine now seems to boot normally.  I only had time to
  try booting it twice, but previously it would fail almost every time,
  so two successive successful boots seems very good.  Thanks for your
  quick responses and working solution!
Can someone with the Dell PW650 (which, I think, should be same as PE600)
test this patch for me? I do not want to send this for inclusion into
Linus' kernel before it's tested.
In theory we probably will want USB handoff to be enabled by default, but
I am not sure this time is now, so let us use DMI lists until then.
Thanks,
-- Pete
