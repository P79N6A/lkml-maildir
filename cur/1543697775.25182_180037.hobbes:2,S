I'm not on a system that I can take down long enough/crash testing 
right now that I could check this.  And, to be honest, I can't think
of anything other than a fork bomb that would do a good job of testing 
this.  I just remembered helping con with O(3)int schedular hacks and 
he seemed concerned with how many math operations take place in sched.c
due to it being in the core.  
If you can suggest a way to test this, I will test it on my system 
tomorrow.
