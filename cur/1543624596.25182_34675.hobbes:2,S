Not exactly, there's a trap: Some models have a
/etc/security/limits.conf which might ulimit some stuff even though you
don't have any direct calls to ulimit. I had already encountered this
several times and wondered if I might consider this a misbehavior.
Anyway, these limits don't apply to root then in the model. I don't know
if this problem is based on that.
