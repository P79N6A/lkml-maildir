Or in a network filesystem, such as AFS, CIFS or SMB where the key holds the
user identity mapping - perhaps a Kerberos ticket.
What I envision for AFS is that there'll be a TGT somewhere on the system,
perhaps in another key, and request-key will invoke a request to the kerberos
server to get an AFS ticket based on that TGT.

Well, each open call would incur a key search, but I've half taken care of the
problem. Adding the concept of a limited-duration negative key would, I think,
take care of the rest.

Well:
	keyctl request <type> <description> <keyring>
Can be used to drive it at the moment, so that I can check that it works.
The scenario I'm mainly interested in involves kAFS/OpenAFS with Kerberos or
other authentication (see above). But I talked to a number of people at OLS
who also expressed an interest.
I need to work on my kAFS client at some point soon to get that to use it, but
that'll be a couple of weeks at least, I think.

With AFS + Krb, you currently make the key available in advance (using the
aklog program) and any request for which you don't have a key fails with some
error or other.
You can't really do it at mount time in this case because you may have more
than one user on the system, and all of them may need to share the same
mountpoints (some people put /usr/ on AFS, for example).
