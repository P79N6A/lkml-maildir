I was part of the team that caught the cracker that broke into the
central GNU archive server (among other sites). He didn't stop there,
but just bounced on, leaving a backdoor for other recipe-book hackers
using the same toolset. (We were decoding the packets from a university
server he'd hacked into, and logging, while reconstructing what he was
seeing in another window. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough)
When he cracked into the GNU site..._THAT_ was when we all went pale,
and turned to the feds and said "Get in there and grab this guy now." We
all knew how many times we'd downloaded and compiled GNU tools,
expecting the source to be pristine. The feds had him in custody 15
minutes later.
We then started going back through the logs and emailing site admins
telling them what had happened and which files had been affected to
leave the backdoors. It took us the rest of the night to get the
warnings off. Many didn't believe us. I have no idea if the GNU folks
responded....Other people handled the replies, while I went off and got
drunk.
I still think about the implications. Just a small hack in one version
of gcc somewhere... Yeesh.
Although this was about 3.5 years ago now, I'm not sure if the guys from
wustl ever got thanked for warning us about the odd traffic coming from
the university servers. My generally directed thankfulness to them all,
whoever they are.
