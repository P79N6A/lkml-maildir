If you're still looking for success reports, I just burned a DVD on 
2.6.16-ide1 just fine. At the final stages of burning I got a few 
messages about the burner not being ready but it kept trying and 
eventually succeeded writing the lead-out. DVD works fine.
Still not tried the pesky tape drive, those tapes I ordered weeks ago 
are still on back order! It is detected properly and claimed by 'st' 
through.
HTH,
Chris
