My drunken state causes me problems with a few things, but Alan's solution
still looks good to me.  If the kernel doesn't perform the #3 check then
you have an unexpected setuid binary on your hands...

If you change the expenected Unix (Linux) protection machanisms (only the
kernel can grant such wonders as low ports, raw sockets, &c) you will
break a hell of a lot more...

No, it's horribly broken.  If you provide an additional way for a binary
to acquire privileges, you must at least check a few things:
1. Old binaries (and people making and "pretending" to make them) are not
   able to acquire these privs,
2. The magical granting of these privs is done _only by privileged
   code_, and
3. (Somewhat controversial) such processes are subject to additional
   security paranioa, similar to (yet at a much lower level than)
   Perl's "tainting".

From the start (I'm not old enough to get the whole picture, but have been
avidly reading the source recently) ext2fs was designed to be entensible. 
Trivial things might be OK, but things like persisent capabilities which
might break old kernels are carefully examined by sharper eyes han mine..
Short summary:
Bollocks.  You seem to forget that any user process can reda, write and
create executable files.  And that, inded, these files can provide dynamic
loading services...
