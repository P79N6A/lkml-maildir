I think there's a certain amount of wishful thinking here. As you say,
everyone has to start from nothing. But if the learning/development
curve is too steep, or the process is too frustrating, you are going
to lose a proportion of the potential gurus. You can't push people in
a direction they don't want to go. Even a smart person can give up if
something seems unnecessarily cumbersome. After all, they have other
things to do as well besides kernel debugging. From what I've seen,
most of the active developers are chronically overworked. Many
projects compete for your attention. Why hit your head against a
purposely erected brick wall?
Social engineering is harder than you think ;-)
