I am not sure about x86, but on ia64, you would be very hard pressed
for this application to actually run you out of memory.  With the
memset commented out, you would be allocating vmas, etc, but you
would not be actually putting pages behind those virtual addresses.

main()
{
	char* buff;
	int count;
	count=0;
	while(1)
	{
		printf("\nOOM Test: Counter = %d", count);
		buff = (char*) malloc(1024);
	//	memset(buff,'\0',1024);
		count++;
		if (buff==NULL)
		{
			printf("\nOOM Test: Memory allocation error");
		}
	}
}

I fail to understand that why the OS doesn't return NULL as per man pages of
malloc. It insteat results in OOM.
