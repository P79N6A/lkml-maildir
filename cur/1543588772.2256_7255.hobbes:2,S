Yes, we are still able to reproduce it without calling fork (the new
program just calls
do_pi() a bunch of times, and then we attach and detach to that process)

You seem to need to attach and detach to a program using the fpu -
running pt on a
process that is just busy-looping over and over some integer adds does
not seem to
while running pi on the machine at the same time, but not attaching to
it does not
seem to affect the floating point state.

          save_fpu();
somebody earlier pointed out, for the possible race when in sys_ptrace, at the
time of attach we modify child->flags.
It really looks again strange that it is software that is causing the problem as
the code to handle FPU looks pretty clean.
still can we check current->flags when the problem occurs ?
