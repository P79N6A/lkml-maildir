tmpfs is a possible problem because it can consume lots of ram/swap.  Which
is why it has limits on the amount of space it can consume.  Those are set as
mount options as I recall.  Which means that we would need to do something
different with respect to limits before tmpfs could become safe for
an untrusted user to mount.
Still it's close.
