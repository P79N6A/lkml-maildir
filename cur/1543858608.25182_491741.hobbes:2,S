Beats me. I gave up trying to understand BIOS authors motivations years ago.

Does it survive a run of testgart when masking out the high bits?
It could be that you're right, and the upper bits being reported really
are garbage.

The amount of RAM is irrelevant, it can appear anywhere in the address space,
which on 64bit, is pretty darned huge.  The aperture isn't backed by RAM,
it's a 'virtual window' of sorts. When you write to an address in that range, it
gets transparently remapped to somewhere else in the address space.
The window is the 'aperture', where it remaps to is controlled by a translation
table called the GATT (which does live in real memory).
That's pretty much all there is to AGP. It's just a really dumb MMU of sorts.
