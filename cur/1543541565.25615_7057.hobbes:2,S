Ok. Let's focus a bit.
Resource forks. HFS. NTFS. Real filesystems. Stuff that cannot sanely be
done in user space.
The "tarfs" thing is a complete red herring. It _can_ sanely be done in
user space. That's how it's been done for the last 30 years.
Let's focus on a thing that _does_ need kernel support, namely good
support for real filesystems that have aspects that are almost, but not
quite, totally unlike "tarfs". 
Ok?
"tarfs" is a cool weekend hack. Not very useful, and with obvious
downsides to it. HFS and NTFS support are obviously useful things where I
don't think anybody really claims that we shouldn't natively support
getting the real data out of files mounted on such a partition.
