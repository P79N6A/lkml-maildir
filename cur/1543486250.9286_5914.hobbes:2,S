Right. Like "we'll use a long for FD_SET". Or "After an accept(),
we immediately do a blocking read() from the new socket".
Or in fact the "Linux doesn't have datagram sockets, so we'll hack syslogd
to use stream sockets, instead of implementing the datagram stuff in the
kernel" mentality, which thankfully seems to be a thing of the past, these
days.
