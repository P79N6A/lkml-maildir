According to my PNIC docs (don't have true Tulip docs handy), this bit
is the logical OR of all the Tx error bits, so it appears a true tx
error has ocurred.

Enabling this printk and setting tulip_debug appropriately would tell us
what tx error you're experiencing.

And this code bumps error counters based on the specific error that
ocurred.  It all seems perfectly sane to me. The actual problem lies
elsewhere, I think.
