-		mca_data = alloc_bootmem(sizeof(struct ia64_mca_cpu)
-					 * NR_CPUS + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE);
+		mca_data = mca_bootmem(NR_CPUS + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE);
Oops.  You moved the multiply by sizeof(struct ia64_mca_cpu) up into
the mca_bootmem() function to make it very specific to this use. But
mutiply has higher precedence than addition.
