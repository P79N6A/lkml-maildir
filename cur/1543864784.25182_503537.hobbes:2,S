Oh, I would love to see something like that happen :)
As I come from an embedded background, I love to see Linux running in
tiny systems.  So anything I can do to help out with that I'd love to
offer.
But being able to read the minds of SOC hardwre engineers and decode all
of the documentation errors they produce is enough to drive one crazy,
my condolences go out to everyone in that situation...
good luck,
