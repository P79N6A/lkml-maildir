Thanks for the input.  You've convinced me.  When going through
arch/ppc/xmon/xmon.c, I will leave things like the following unchanged:
/* Command interpreting routine */
static int
cmds(struct pt_regs *excp)
{
My changes will be similar to the following:
@@ -1837,9 +1818,7 @@
        return *lineptr++;
 }
-void
-take_input(str)
-char *str;
+void take_input(char *str)
 {
        lineptr = str;
 }
I'll be changing the return type/function name line orientation only
when making other changes. And these will still go through the
applicable maintainers.
