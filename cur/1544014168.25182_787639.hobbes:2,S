I'll give this a spin tomorrow as well. A hunch tells me that this is
likely a page reuse issue, that splice is getting the reference to the
buffer dropped before the data has really been transmitted. IOW, the
page is likely fine reaching the ->sendpage() bit, but will be reused
before the data has actually been transmitted. So once you get that far,
other random data from that page is going out.
Just a guess, I'll try and reproduce this tomorrow!
