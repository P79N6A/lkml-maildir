So what. the user was authorized to open the input file. The user was
authorized to open the output file. A file copy should be possible remotely
since the equivalent implementation of a local read/write loop would
accomplish the same thing.

Now if you wanted the remote server to deny the network copy... could
be done - after all the credentials for both input and output files
are present on the server. If the server decides NOT to copy, then fine.
It would just cause the user to make the copy with a read/write loop.
I was only thinking of it as a way to gain access to any filesystem
support that may be available for copying files. If none is available,
then do it in user mode.
Personally, I'm not sure it is a good idea, partly because the semantics
of a file copy operation are not well defined (some of the following IS 
known).
1. what happens if the copy is aborted?
2. what happens if the network drops while the remote server continues?
3. what about buffer synchronization?
4. what errors should be reported ?
5. what happens when the syscall is interupted? Especially if the remote
   copy may take a while (I've seen some require an hour or more - worst
   case: days due to a media error (completed after the disk was replaced)).
6. what about a client opening the copy before it is finished copying?
