My main motivations for moving media selection from a timer into a
kernel thread are:
* the timer oftens takes a loooong time to run (some drivers have extra
junk in the timer funcs that really should be in a kthread anyway),  and
* do_ioctl, which calls the mdio_xxx functions, holds rtnl_lock, which
is a semaphore.  the kernel thread can easily acquire this semaphore
too, a timer can't.
I agree that it needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis.  Better
hardware, where MDIO access is just a few bus reads/writes, probably
doesn't need a kernel thread.
Finally, for most net drivers, media selection occurs once every 60
seconds or so, not a big impact even on 2.2.x...

I think I'm already on the CC list.
I'm confused here though....   How does tq_context apply here?  Your
suggested direction of tq_context seems ok, but I don't see how it
applies to situations where polling needs to occur, like where yenta
polls when request_irq fails, or when net drivers poll media selection
here.
