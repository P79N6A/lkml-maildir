 I'll bite, as I've been forced to use it at times.
1. User configures fetchmail to download from imap/pop3 account (with
the messages kept on the server and just recorded -- Ie. nothing is
deleted server side).
2. User has exim as local transport, and also gets normal SMTP
traffic.
3. User enables sender_verify, sender_verify_hosts_callback and
sender_verify_callback_domains which catches loads of spam and is
happy.
 Then...
. User runs fetchmail
. fetchmail feeds email to exim
. exim does callback verification, and refuses email.
. fetchmail pretends it has delivered email, so _even if_ you hack your
  MTA to say don't verify from localhost lost emails will never be
  delivered by fetchmail (even though they are still on the server,
  and fetchmail knew they didn't get sent).
...and that assumes that you swallow the argument that you should have
to reconfigure your MTA to work around fetchmail bugs.

The Hurd itself is aggressively multi-threaded and all of the locking has
been done with an eye towards multi-processor systems. That said, we have
not yet used a microkernel that stably supports multiple cpus.
