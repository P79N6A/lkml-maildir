If you run 'badblocks /dev/hdc1' it will do a full (read-only by default)
surface scan of the disk and report the bad blocks.  This still doesn't
tell you the filename though.
You can use "debugfs /dev/hdc1" and then "icheck 525031" (assuming
you have a 4kB block ext2/ext3 filesystem on this drive) and then
"ncheck <inum>" for the inode number returned by icheck to find the
filename.
As someone else reported, running "e2fsck -c" will add this block to
the bad blocks list, and re-assign another block for the file in question.
It runs 'badblocks' in the background with the correct parameters (read
only check, correct blocksize for the filesystem).
Cheers, Andreas
