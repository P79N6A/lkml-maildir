I was looking at this code the other day too.

It's probably worth preceding this with the original test, `cmpl $0,%0;
jg 2f', to avoid a thundering herd of locked operations.
Remember to do atomic_inc(&sem->waking) in wake_one_more() too.
Having given your code some thought, it looks ok.  The retry loop is
obviously very important.
I can't think of any livelock scenarious either, which is a good sign.
