Well, it also prevents us from getting a reference to an object that is 
being deleted. The chance of that happening is slim, and it indicates a 
need for synchronization at a higher level (if the kobject_get() on the 
object being deleted was to be delayed for some reason, they would likely 
be referencing freed memory anyway). 
And, in theory, an uninitialized object shouldn't be accessible, and any 
code doing that is buggy, and will have other problems. 
In short, I think we can remove the locks entirely. We can at least see 
what happens..
