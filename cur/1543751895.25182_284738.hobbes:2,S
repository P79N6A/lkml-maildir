I've just tried 2.6.10-ac8 on my target (an arm PDA) and it doesn't help 
ide-cs.c. When I pull out a mounted CF out the socket, the kernel prints 
"Unregister 0 fail 1 0" repeatedly on the console showing the usage count 
permanently stays at 1. This is the same problem as under 2.6.10.
I haven't investigated it yet but I suspect the usage count is held by 
ide-disk as the CF card has a mounted filesystem. As previously mentioned 
and for reference, this patch has the changes I had to make to get standard 
2.6.10 to work:
