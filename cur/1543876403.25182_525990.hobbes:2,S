People always come up with new complexities I never thought kconfig
would be able to do. Nice stuff. I'll take up on your idea and
incorporate it right away.
But I would have to ask: Why do we need 100/250/300/1000 if there is
anyway an input field for the user to enter - s/he should read the
help text for Known Good values, should not s/he?
