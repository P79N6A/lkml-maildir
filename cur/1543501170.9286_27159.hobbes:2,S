The only justification (sort of) that I have seen to date of this is that
(nebulous) applications (Offics Suites?) will manage "compound documents"
of some sort. So I started thinking about my particular needs:
- I've got papers with figures (xfig, translated into EPS) and graphs
  (gnuplot)
- Some of my proposals include spreadsheets. In all of them I used
  spreadsheets to compute the numbers in the tables.
- My exams include figures (xfig), Pascal, C, yacc, lex, ... code snippets
- Some of the theses I've guided included screenshots
I'm sure others will come up with even wider needs. Note that not
everything in the document (in its wider sense) shows up in print later: I
mentioned spreadsheets used to compute some of the tables. I've used Perl
scripts (or shell commands) in other cases. I may also have a function in C
(or whatever other language fits your fancy) that is included in the
printed text (perhaps with sample output, a screenshot, ...), and want to
have test data and rigs nearby to check it out. Perhaps part of the final
printout are generated from other parts (C source compiled into assembler
by _my_ experimental compiler, for instance).
Now, build an Office Suite than can do all that, and the infrastruture in
terms of "files" that are able to manage its data. Methinks the result
could very well be called "Operating System" (complete with applications),
and its "files" will be filesystems. Unix was designed and evolved to be an
_environment_ in which to do myriards of different things, specially things
the designers weren't even able to think of. It has been a resounding
sucess there. Extend it, build on it; or replace it by something better
from the ground up. But don't try to embed another OS inside it: That is
just duplicationg effort (both for the designer/builder/maintainer and also
the user).
OTOH, Unix is about flexibility, and "user knows best". This way seems to
me leads to "This is _all_ you can do with your data" (The One and Only M$
Way), or horrible bloat and such complexity that nobody will use 5% of the
whole mess. Just to get what we've got now? Minus the possibility of
shooting your feet in the traditional way, but I'm sure it will include
firearms and bullets enough to do it in new, more entertaining ways.
Just 2 cents worth of gasoline ;-)
