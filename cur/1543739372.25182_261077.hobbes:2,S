Using IO_CMD_READ for a vector entails
- converting the userspace structure (which might well an iovec) to iocbs
- copying all those iocbs to the kernel
- merging the iocbs
- generating multiple completions for the merged request
- copying the completions to userspace
- coalescing the multiple completions in userspace to a single completion
error handling is difficult as well. one would expect that a bad sector 
with multiple iocbs would only fail one of the requests. it seems to be 
non-trivial to implement this correctly.
IO_CMD_PREADV, by contrast, is very simple, intuitive, and efficient.
