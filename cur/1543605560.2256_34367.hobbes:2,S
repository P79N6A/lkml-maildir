Hi!
I never releasedswsusp for 2.4.10, but it is easy to port. If you prot
it, be *extremely* carefull. It managed to kill my / directory by
overwriding inodes <14 with junk. It worked pretty well under 2.4.10.
Now I have corrupted / fs. After 10-or-so-fscks, I got to the state
when only error is 
Block bitmap differences: +0 +1 ... +32767.
But even if I ask to fix it, its back there on next fsck (both on
2.4.? and 2.2.9), so I suspect fsck bug. fsck is e2fsck 1.18.
Is it known bug or is someone willing to chase it? Is it safe to boot
with this problem going multiuser?
