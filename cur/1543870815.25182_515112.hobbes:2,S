Our real hardware does behave as described and therefore does not suffer 
from the problem.
If you want a software solution then you may want to look at Zoran 
Radovic's work on Hierachical Backoff locks. I had a draft of a patch a 
couple of years back that showed some promise to reduce lock contention. 
HBO locks can solve starvation issues by stopping local lock takers.
