Perhaps you were not explaining your position clearly. I gathered that the
behavior, as described, was perfectly valid, just dangerous. You, on the
other hand, are now clarifying that the behavior of the system, when those
bytes were sent, is not correct. In other words, it's possible for the
system to 'accidentally' fry a hard drive... is this correct?
If so, then obviously it should be fixed.
If, however, it is merely a very specific sequence of commands that would
never occur in the real world, can only be sent as root, and then fry the
hard drive... I'm not certain that's very important. I'm sure there are a
billion and one ways to fry the system if you're trying to, one more will
not make a difference.
