Hi everyone
I am writing a application which requires to add new things to the end of  a
existing file. So I open the file in append mode. But once the file is opened
in append mode  when ever I write any data it always writes to the end of
the file and not where the FILE_POINTER is positioned using LSEEK. 
Is this right shouldn't it be working like this i.e:
When a file is opened in append mode. The file is opened in write mode with the
FILE_POINTER pointing to the END of the FILE, so that any new data added is
added to the end of the file. But if one uses LSEEK , then from then on it
should start writing from the position pointed to by FILE_POINTER.
i.e simply put it always writes to the Position pointed to by FILE_POINTER with
the special  property that when the file is opened initialy the FILE_POINTER
gets set to the end_of_file.
******** OR ELSE MAY BE ATLEAST THIS CAN BE DONE*************
If APPEND is such that it always sets the FILE_POINTER to End_of_File when one
is writing to the file (As documented in Opens man page), then shouldn't the
LSEEK call give a error if one tries to lseek on a File OPENed in Append mode
with WRITE ONLY access because the only time lseeking on append mode file makes
sense is when one opened it with READ mode access also.
I can achieve what I want with the existing Append behaviour, by rather not
using append mode but using write mode and initially setting the FILE_POINTER
to End_of_File so that I achieve what I want. But I still think that LSEEK
shouldn't mislead me by allowing me to position the FILE_POINTER where ever I
want when in APPEND | WRITE_ONLY mode followed by Write completely IGNORING
the FILE_POINTER.
