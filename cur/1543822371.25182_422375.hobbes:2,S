Subject: [PATCH 3/5] mm: create __alloc_bootmem_low_nopanic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/9/362

Per Andi Kleen's suggestion in the review of our Calgary IOMMU code, I
tried to use the alloc_bootmem_nopanic when allocing bootmem.
Unfortunately, it needs low mem for our translation tables, so we needed
a new function to do this.
I have updated swiotlb to take advantage of this new function in the
patch following this one.
This patch has been tested individually and cumulatively on x86_64 and
cross-compile tested on IA64.  Since I have no IA64 hardware, any
testing on that platform would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Jon
