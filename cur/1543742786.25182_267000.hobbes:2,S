Linux 2.6.9 dies if I try to start x on my radeon 9200 SE pci card.
The screen goes black, and there is no response from the keyboard.
Sysrq doesn't work, I have to use the reset button.
Running X with the same configuration is fine with linux 2.6.8.1.
There is also a matrox G550 AGP card in the machine, and I have compiled
3D drivers for both cards.
