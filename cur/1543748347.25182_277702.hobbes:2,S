This was discussed about two months ago without a firm
resolution as far as I can tell, in this thread:
    
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/241862
Especially from Jens and Alan:

I've been meaning to start a "CD-ROM ide-dma blacklist amnesty
drive" ;-) The intent is to gather comments from owners of
blacklisted drives to see if those models still deserve to be on
the blacklist.
As for myself, I would vote for removing "PLEXTOR CD-R
PX-W8432T" (at least firmware "1.09") from the list.  This model
seems to work fine with DMA.  As Alexander does, I have been
running it on VIA motherboard which only recently started
looking at the ide-dma blacklist without trouble; that is,
before via82cxxx started caring.
The following is a list of CD drives blacklisted (I've removed
hard-disks and flash from the list) in drivers/ide/ide-dma.c as
of 2.6.10-rc3:
    Compaq CRD-8241B
    CRD-8400B
    CRD-8480B
    CRD-8480C
    CRD-8482B
    CRD-84
    SANYO CD-ROM CRD
    HITACHI CDR-8
    HITACHI CDR-8335
    HITACHI CDR-8435
    Toshiba CD-ROM XM-6202B
    CD-532E-A
    E-IDE CD-ROM CR-840
    CD-ROM Drive/F5A
    WPI CDD-820
    SAMSUNG CD-ROM SC-148C
    SAMSUNG CD-ROM SC-148F
    SAMSUNG CD-ROM SC
    SAMSUNG CD-ROM SN-124
    PLEXTOR CD-R PX-W8432T
    ATAPI CD-ROM DRIVE 40X MAXIMUM
    _NEC DV5800A
If (1) you are a owner of one of the listed drives, and (2) you
know your drive works fine with DMA, please speak up.
It would especially be a big plus if your drive is on via82cxxx
and did not have any trouble running it with DMA before 2.6.8.
Thanks.
