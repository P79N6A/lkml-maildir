   RMS's elitest "I wrote all the free software so put my name on it"
   attitude.  Sure, he did something great, started a free software movement.
   BUT, that does not entitle him to world domination.  Linux is not the only
   OS using GNU components.  Most EVERY free OS uses gcc, and quite a few
   commercial ones do (ie: BSD/OS).  It is just plain SILLY to see him think
   that because we use ls and stuff that are licensed under the GPL, that we
   should put GNU in the name of the operating system.
The other thing to keep in mind was that there was plenty of free
software floating around on the net before Stallman founded the FSF.
The Usenet culture of releasing fairly significant packages on
newsgroups such as comp.sources.unix predates the FSF.  Perl, for
example, came out of that culture, before Usenet was ruined by AOL and
Spam.  So to say that Stallman, GNU, and/or the FSF "invented" free
software is simply not true.
