I found the problem with this to be the eepro100 driver in 2.2.12-20 and
2.2.14.  Thanks to Dave Higgens at VALinux for pointing me to potential
problems with the eepro100 driver.  I downloaded Andrey V. Savochkin's
driver, installed it and all my problems miraculously went away. 
Interestingly, I was sent off-track by the fact that when the eepro100
misbehaved the 3c575_cb driver responded in kind....
Anyway, the 2.2.15pre10 release has the Savochkin updated eepro100
driver, so if someone else is having any funny (not!) behavior and tells
you that they are running any pre-2.2.15 eepro100 driver you can send
them that direction first!
Thanks for the ear,
Phil
