Paul,
Your patch did not really solve the problem - the kernel failed in some
place else.  Looking into the matter only gets me more confused about
the skb stuff.
It failed in sending out the first bootp packet. 
static void __init ic_bootp_send_if(struct ic_device *d, u32 jiffies)
{
	int hh_len = (dev->hard_header_len + 15) & ~15;
	/* Allocate packet */
	skb = alloc_skb(sizeof(struct bootp_pkt) + hh_len + 15, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!skb)
		return;
	skb_reserve(skb, hh_len);
...
Here the dev->hard_header_len is 14 bytes, and hh_len becomes 16.  So
after skb_reserve(skb, hh_len) function call, skb->data is aligned along
4-byte boundary.
However, right before the packet is sent, eth_header() function is
called, which copies the 14 bytes ether header (including mac address)
before skb->data, AND substracts skb->data by 14.  This perfectly makes
skb->data off 4-byte boundary and causes a bus error in
ei_block_output() when the driver tries to send it out.
Again, I am not a network guru, and I cannot tell where things exactly
go wrong.  But I do know someone is to blame here. :-) Any help?
Jun
P.S., is there explanation about the whole skb stuff?  What is policy
regarding how skb->data is manipulated and how it should be aligned?  To
me it just looks a big black magic uglily scattered around net driver
code ...
