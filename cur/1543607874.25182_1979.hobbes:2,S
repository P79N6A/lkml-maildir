Oh yes, sometimes 2.0 kernel would crash at 497.1 days¹. I guess it depends
on what you were doing at the time and what drivers and options you were
using. I think most of the jiffies wraparound bugs were cleaned at the
2.1.x time (so I have been told.)
(I've experienced one such crash, I'm not sure whether it was 2.0.36 or
2.0.38.)

¹) it is 497.10 days or 2^32 seconds, not 496 days.
