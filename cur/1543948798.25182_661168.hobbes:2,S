i've got the patch below queued up already - same thing, right?

Subject: rcupreempt: fix hibernate/resume in presence of PREEMPT_RCU and hotplug
From: "Paul E. McKenney" <paulmck@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

This fixes a oops encountered when doing hibernate/resume in presence
of PREEMPT_RCU.  The problem was that the code failed to disable preemption
when accessing a per-CPU variable.  This is OK when called from code
that already has preemption disabled, but such is not the case from
the suspend/resume code path.
