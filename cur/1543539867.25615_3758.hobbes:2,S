Assume it will be available in the bootdisk. If this is a problem, they
could allow you to add "noapic" to the command line, or supply two kernel
images. Not a huge problem.

You don't seem to have any procedure in place for recovering if/when the
upgrade fails. If you can't get the NICs online, or boot into Linux, what
are you going to do?
