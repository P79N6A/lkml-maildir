Hi Andi,
Please apply these four patches to your tree for 2.6.20. The first one
is trivial, second one is a bug fix for certain configuration of x460
(and in general replaces a hack with the Right Thing(TM), third is a
cleanup and fourth is mostly for the distros but also useful in
mainline. More details available with each patch.
Thanks,
Muli
