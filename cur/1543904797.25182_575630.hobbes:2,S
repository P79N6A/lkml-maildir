I still wonder what the "the swap thing" is though. People just kept saying 
that swap-prefetch helped which would seem to indicate their problem didnt 
have anything to do with updatedb.
Also, I know shit about the VFS so this may well be not very educated but to 
me something like FADV_NOREUSE on a dirfd sounds like a much more promising 
approach than the convoluted userspace schemes being discussed, if only 
because it'll actually be implemented/used.
