As long as you're staying in the same domain of capabilities, there's no
really big issue.  The problem starts when you use fork(), exec(), and friends
to launch something that may have a different set of capabilities (either more
or less). Also note that exploited code can cause an exec() in a program that
doesn't even have a call to exec() in it....
