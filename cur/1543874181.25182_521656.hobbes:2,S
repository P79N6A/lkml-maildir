That's the idea, but if I want to send an inter-processor-interrupt to 
another cpu, I need to be able to identify it.  The pid [tid] is 
natural, but racy if the thread can die.

Yes!  The vcpu is an implied parameter (current->vcpu).

I agree with all of the above, and in addition, integration to the 
scheduler will allow us to reduce vcpu migration rate, and maybe do 
things like gang scheduling.
But that doesn't mean it can be done now: we really need to see how it 
works out with smp and with an additional arch, and then we can 
stabilize it.  Meanwhile I'd like a stable ABI so distros can start 
shipping kvm without worrying about upgrade headaches.
So the plan is:
- get the /dev/kvm ABI into 2.6.22
- implement smp
- add another arch
- move to a syscall based interface in parallel; userspace should work 
with both
- deprecate the old ABI and external modules.
