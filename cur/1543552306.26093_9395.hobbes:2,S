Not true.  The named on our loghost is authoritative for the reverse
mappings for all of the machines which can log there.

There *is* no configuration for these tools which gives the behavior
you describe, so this is not a "configuration error".

Historically, no other Unix system has had reliable syslogging.  It
would require very defensive programming for syslogd, and that has
clearly not been performed.
And if this is what GNU/Linux intends, why does glibc use a SOCK_DGRAM
socket for communication with syslogd?  By definition, such sockets
are *unreliable*.  If syslog is supposed to be reliable, a different
connection type must be used.
Your philosophy that "no syslog message should ever be lost" is not
necessarily bad.  But it is clearly at odds with historical practice,
the current glibc syslog() implementation, and the current syslogd
itself.
It is true that glibc falls back to using SOCK_STREAM if the
SOCK_DGRAM connection fails.  Does that mean GNU/Linux is expects
syslog to be reliable eventually?  If so, then my problem is entirely
a bug in syslogd and I will report it as such.
