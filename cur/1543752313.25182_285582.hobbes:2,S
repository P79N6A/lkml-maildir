Sure.  My system does have some of these running at nice -10.  Where
(how) do I change them?
BTW, let's not lose sight of the fact that `nice --20 foo' requires
CAP_SYS_NICE just like SCHED_FIFO does.  From a privilege perspective,
this recurses to the same (still unsolved) problem.  
Chris's rlimits proposal was the only workable suggestion I've seen
for that.  Is there any hope of doing something like that in the 2.6.x
timeframe?  
At this point, I no longer even care that PAM will probably start
randomly assigning users unlimited scheduling rights like it recently
did for mlock.  Eventually, that will get fixed.  :-(
