Thank your explaining this aspect of the linux block device layer design.
Earlier, we tried bio barriers (hard barriers) and found the slow down
to be too great. After my previous email we looked further down the stack and
noticed that struct request also has a soft barrier option. For our tests,
soft barriers perform almost as well as no barriers, and our system
is ok (for now, at least) with the write reordering that devices can do.
As our code calls generic_make_request(), it does not have access to the
created struct request. We have modified block/ll_rw_blk.c:__make_request()
to 1) not merge requests and to 2) add the REQ_SOFTBARRIER flag to the new
request's cmd_flags field. Is there a more modular way for a function to
create a new request with a soft barrier?
thanks again,
