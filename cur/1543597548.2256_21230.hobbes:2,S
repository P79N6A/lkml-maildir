Hi.
How can I make be sure a symlink is on disk? In other words, I need to be
sure that both the symbolic link and the 'newpath' are on disk, so that
once the call has returned, I can pull out the plug of the computer and
not lose any data. Is it enough to sync() the directory to which the new
symlink was written?
