On x86-64 it's just %fs:offset. gcc is a bit dumb on this and usually
loads the base address from %fs:0 first.

Your scheme relies on task_struct fields being on a known offset
in the page. But slab cache coloring varies the offset to make the data
spread out better in the caches.

It varies relative to the start of page.
That was one of the bigger wins relative to the task_struct in stack
page of 2.4 had.

You would need to wrap everything and likely users would like
task_struct so much that they accessed it anyways without your wrappers.

Yes, but it's a defined function. No different from a system call.
