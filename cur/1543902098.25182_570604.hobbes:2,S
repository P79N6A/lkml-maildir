Subject: [PATCH] Reading the VDSO area - i386

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Jeremy,
I was doing some tests that attempt to read the VDSO area of a
task through either the /proc/pid/mem or ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT,
...) interfaces, and it seems that when the CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO kernel
parameter is enabled, we can no longer successfully read the VDSO area
on i386 kernels.
I believe that debuggers such as gdb will attempt to sometimes walkback
through the vsyscall area, and not being able to read the vsyscall/vdso
area would thus cause debuggers problems.
So assuming that this change in behavior was not intentional, I've
provided my stab (just an idea) at a fix.  With this change below,
the code in places such as get_user_pages() can now successfully call
in_gate_area() and then subsequently call get_gate_vma(), which already
properly returns the correct info.
Thanks for taking the time to read over this.
