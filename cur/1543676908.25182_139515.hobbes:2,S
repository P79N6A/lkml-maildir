I've had this problem as well.
What I've been able to do is to use a backport for one of the 2.4.21-pre*
series, and move the code forward to the current 2.4.21-rc's .
Here's info on the relevant patch:
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Mar/3999.html
The Radeon 9700 Pro now functions with the ATI binary-only drivers, BUT
only with 2D acceleration. In other words, I have to set the "DisableDRI"
option in XF86Config-4 to yes.
So I get no 3D acceleration, but at least I get 2D acceleration and don't
have to run it in framebuffer mode like before.
I wish ATI would either open-source their drivers or come out with a fix
ASAP. :-/
