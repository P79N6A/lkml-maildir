And there actually is a possibility for my patch to break things.
Davide's example should still work, but there may be others.  Point
taken.

Well, that rare case is one that some people are quite concerned
about.  The sigaltstack is nice because it reduces the likelyhood, but
it doesn't cure the paranoia completely.

Both of which I want to have, right.

What do we do, if a program also uses SA_NOMASK for the SIGSEGV
handler?  This is totally stupid, I agree, but it is legal.  Should we
declare it illegal from this day on, or is that path blocked as well?
