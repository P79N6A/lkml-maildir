It isnt just PCI config space . At least it doesnt appear to be. A 
simple loop dumping /vmlinuz to the mmio space on a 3dfx card appears
to crash the card, the bus and the PC.
If it was just PCI configuration space it would be relatively easy to
fix - you make PCI config setup root only and provide a "set3dfx" tool
