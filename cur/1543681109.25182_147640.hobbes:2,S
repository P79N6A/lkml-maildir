Beware - luckily I don't have to worry about that on ARM (we do our own
thing.)  However, with this code:
int foo(unsigned long long n)
{
        if (((n) >> 31 >> 1) == 0) {
                return 1;
        } else {
                return 0;
        }
}
gcc 3.2.2 on ARM (32-bit) produces some not-very-nice code, consisting of
6 shifts and including placing one register on the stack and completely
ignoring a register which it could freely use instead.
