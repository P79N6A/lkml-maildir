That's correct, because it can only emulate about 230 different
keycodes. Note that this is not 'invent what the keyboard sent', since
in many cases the keyboard did not send any keycodes (USB) or at least
not any AT-looking keycodes.
However XFree86 (and this hack is there ONLY because of XFree86) needs
AT-looking keycodes on most architectures.
If somebody could teach XFree86 to use at least the medium raw mode
here, we could get rid both of the emulate_raw() stuff and of the
limitation of what we can pass to XFree86.
Also, this causes trouble with the japanese keys in XFree86, since the
KEY_INTL* keys are in the e0 xx range because of the emulation.

We may need to change this to a u16, IF we'll ever need to load a
keycode above 256 for an AT keyboard. Keep in mind that AT keyboards are
not the whole world. So far all the keys on AT keyboards are within the
0..255 range. That's of course not true for other, more crazy keyboards.

We could do an audit of the key definitions, document which KEY_* symbol
means exactly what (and it'd be a good thing anyway), by that try to
remove duplicities and try to stuff everything in 0..255.
We'd lose te potential possibility to map keysyms to buttons, though
since that never was used, nobody would cry probably.
However, my experience tells me that whenever some range is tight, and
0..255 is in this case, we will very soon overflow as new weird devices
come into market.
