You are attacking a point that I did not make.
The board support code knows such things as that the "front ethernet
port" on the board is connected to the CPU's MII port number #2, but
the board support code does _not_ know that MII port number #2
corresponds to "ixp4xx hardware queue #5."
If Intel puts out a firmware update next month, and your ethernet
driver is modified to take advantage of the new features in that
firmware and starts depending on the newer version of that firmware,
we will have to modify every ixp4xx board support file in case the
firmware update modifies the ixp4xx queue numbers in use.  The
mapping from hardware ports (MII port #0, MII port #6, HSS port
#42, whatever) to ixp4xx hardware queue numbers (0-63) should _not_
be put in every single ixp4xx board support file.
Even if you only change the
	(in board support file)
	.rxq		= 4,
line to something like this instead:
	(in some ixp4xx-specific or driver-specific header file)
	#define IXP4XX_MII_PORT_1_RX_QUEUE		4
	(in board support file)
	.rxq		= IXP4XX_MII_PORT_1_RX_QUEUE,
then you have remved this dependency, and then you only have to update
one place if you move to a newer firmware version.

You can read Polish, how can you complain about code readability. :-))

Sure, point taken, it's just that the person after you might not
remember..
