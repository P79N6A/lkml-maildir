Subject: [patch] string.h string-486.h - please test!

To everybody with [45]86 machines who is interested:
This patch makes kernels compiled for 486 and 586
include string-486.h, not string.h.
I made it as a request by a few people who think
it is a good idea to have a little bit faster
and smaller kernels on machines noted above.
AFAIK there were some problems with these procs in
the past, but i didn't heard anything long time from
now.
I hope my patches before few months made string routines
stable, but if not i would like to know.
thanks,
