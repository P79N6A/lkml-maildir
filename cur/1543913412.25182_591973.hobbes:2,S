Sure, and on some Intel platforms we can configure things similarly.  
But any such changes will be platform specific.  I'm just not sure 
allocating mmconfig space ourselves is worth the trouble.  Besides, 
most machines made in the last few years can do it, as long as we look 
at the right BIOS bits (i.e. MCFG not e820) and remember to disable PCI 
device decode when probing BAR sizes for example. :)
