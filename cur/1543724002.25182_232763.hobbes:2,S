If the regs are garbage, copy_thread() will explode as it tries
to interpret the stack pointer in that regs value.
The parent's regs (stored in current_thread_info() at trap time,
and also needed by copy_thread() processing) will also be garbage
since we're avoiding the fork syscall trap.
In short, this won't work :)
This is why I use kernel_thread().  Why is that so bad?
