Ok, thanks for the explaination.
The bug is born from the patched install_file_pte(). Before there was no need 
to store the protection bits, now it's needed.
So, it sets a pte_file PTE containing no page, and on PROT_NONE it uses 
_PAGE_PROTNONE|_PAGE_FILE.
Indeed, what I've actually coded and tested was safer, but I wanted to know if 
it could be simpler (and faster). For i386 it should be (I've re-tested only 
UML so far):
-#define pte_present(x)  ((x).pte_low & (_PAGE_PRESENT | _PAGE_PROTNONE))
+#define pte_present(x)  (((x).pte_low & _PAGE_PRESENT) || \
+	(((x).pte_low & (_PAGE_PROTNONE|_PAGE_FILE)) == _PAGE_PROTNONE))

+++ linux-2.6.git/include/asm-um/pgtable.h
@@
-#define pte_present(x) pte_get_bits(x, (_PAGE_PRESENT | _PAGE_PROTNONE))
+#define pte_present(x) (pte_get_bits(x, (_PAGE_PRESENT)) || (pte_get_bits(x, 
(_PAGE_PROTNONE)) && !pte_file(x)))

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
