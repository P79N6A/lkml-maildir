Interesting, i haven't come across this problem before but it sounds like 
the vector isn't getting delivered when the interrupt gets asserted and 
only gets triggered later followed by an EOI... or something. Then again 
its probably been beaten around a couple of times by now so i probably am 
not adding anything new.
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:irq_vector seems to be what you're looking for.
Good luck,
