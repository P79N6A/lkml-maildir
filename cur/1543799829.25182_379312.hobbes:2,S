Subject: [RFC] Remove EXPERIMENTAL for module versioning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Module versioning has since early 2.5 been marked EXPERIMENTAL.
But except for one recent bug fixed already fixed by Robin Holt
I have had no mails about this feature for a long time.
So it is to be considered a stable feature and it will have the
EXPERIMENTAL mark removed.
Let me know if you disagree.
