Ok guys, those of you who have been saying that somehow link, etc., will 
break and Unix cannot handle version control, I am sorry, Clearcase does 
all this stuff in the filesystem, and it more or less works, and their 
primary disadvantages are that they don't have reiserfs levels of 
performance, their software is not tight and clean which makes being a 
Clearcase Admin so much work that it funded the creation of Namesys, and 
they are an expensive closed source solution.  Once Josh's transactions 
are in place, we can start convincing application writers that rename is 
a sorry ass transactions API, and start thinking about coding basic 
version control in the FS.  My sysadmin thinks that views are the best 
security model for network service offering processes to run with, and I 
think he is right (chroot just isn't convenient enough to get used a lot 
in practice).
If you don't like the closed source nature of Bitkeeper, stop your 
whining and help out with reiserfs v5 (reiser5 development to start in 
October, reiser4 is a prereq for reiser5 and feature freeze for reiser4 
is in place).  In the meantime, give Larry a thank you for giving us 
something we wouldn't otherwise have and sorely need.

So it is fair to say that all those folks who were irritated by the VMS 
version control feature were just not VMS sophisticates.   Thanks Steven.
