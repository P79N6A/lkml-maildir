I still think it's bogus.  Those "early init of device" messages
should only be occurring for specific legacy ISA device drivers,
and for nothing else.
You need to find a way to link in the S390 network drivers after the
net/ module so that the drivers run their init after net_dev_init()
runs.
Sure, this refcount thing is a bug, and I will look at your patch, but
you need to make your normal net devices get init'd after
net_dev_init() runs.
Later,
