in the x86 space there's a lot of Sparse activity as well: a number of 
developers do systematic runs of Sparse and keep the tree Sparse-clean.
The moment this spreads to a critical mass of subsystems we can start 
automating it. (as i was able to automate the checking of -Werr builds on 
x86, with arbitrary random .config's)
