What do you mean by 'hang' in this context? Does the entire machine
die, or is it just the nfs mount?
Also, can you reproduce it with the patch
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.9/linux-2.4.9-rpc_smpfixes.dif
(the same patch applies fine to 2.4.[678] if you for some reason don't
like 2.4.9)
Cheers,
  Trond
