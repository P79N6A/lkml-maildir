Hi Eric,
Currently I am testing your patches on i386. With CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
kernel boots fine and kexec also works.
But my kernel hangs on kexec on panic case. It hangs early in 
decompress_kernel(). Kernel hangs at following condition.
+       if (((u32)output - CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) & 0x3fffff)
+               error("Destination address not 4M aligned");
I have reserved 64MB at 16M and kernel is loaded at 16M. 
I had expected that I would get "Destination address not 4M aligned" on
serial console but did not happen. Had to put outb() to get to this point.
Will look more into it.
Thanks
Vivek
