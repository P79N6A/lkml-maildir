In certain cases, I guess it could be a problem in the embedded
environment. Especially while running general purpose applications
with carefully designed real-time tasks. An OOM in such a case is
unacceptable.
The whole problem looks like an extension of page frame reclamation in
user space. If the user application's cache was owned by the kernel
(something like vmsplice with SPLICE_F_GIFT?), and the application
managed it accordingly, then they could probably be brought under the
purview of kernel's memory reclamation. This would mean that
applications wouldn't need to be triggered on low memory, and leave
memory freeing to the kernel (simpler and uniform). Perhaps it is even
possible to do this in the kernel currently somehow...?
