80MB/s is also LVD.  The fastest you can go on a SE narrow chain is in 
fact 20MB/s.

The 29160 card detects which cable a device is hooked to and the driver 
then sets the maximum allowed speed according to that.  When you plug a 
drive into a SE cable, the driver knows it and sets the maximum speed to 
SE speeds.

16bit is off in the BIOS settings, so it wouldn't get used regardless.

No, the order of devices has no impact on this.  No device has any impact 
on any other device's speed settings unless they are both connected to the 
same physical cable and one of the devices is forcing a cable that *could* 
be in LVD mode into SE mode instead.  Short of that, all device 
negotiations are 100% independant of each other.
