I am in the process of writing a Linux kernel space module for an analog
to digital converter card (on an Intel platform computer).
The card has a certain 32-bit register where bits 31:18 need to hold the
address of a buffer in the host computer's memory to write the A/D
results too.  Bits 17:0 are a counter and are read-only.
The problem is that any memory I allocate for this buffer in the module
is a 32-bit address well above the range of addresses that will fit into
the high 14 bits that I have available.
Is there a way for the module to obtain a 256KByte chunk of memory that
can be addresses with only 14 bits?
It is fairly important that this driver be a module, but if it can't be
done this way, is there a way to accomplish the same 14 bit address
limit with the driver compiled into the kernel?
Thank you for any help with this problem,
Michael Berg <mberg@nmt.edu>
