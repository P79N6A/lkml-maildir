OK, reference to the similar issues I have seen on 2 boxes here at
work (ukqip01 & 02), I have dug out an old mail I sent to colleague
after the 3 time it happened to me:
"In fact it has happened to both of them now.  UKQIP01 restarted once
(about 3 years) ago in the middle of the night, then about 6 months
later UKQIP02 did the same.  If you remember I then replaced memory
from 512 to 1024.
Now UKQIP02 has done it again.
I am not too concerned, as twice in 3 years is not really a problem
(yet), but I am more curious as to why because I want to fix it.
It also only happens in the dead twilight hours too.
I will look at running memtest, but as you know that takes hours and
the box will have to taken down for the duration.
I will keep you informed."
This was last September 2005 - the time it happened before that was
Janurary 2005.
Very strange.
