Hi all,
Im getting an error with kernel 2.2.17pre16 (which may/may not be fixed in
a later release):
Aug 26 14:46:35 jim kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for
procmail...
Aug 26 20:10:18 jim kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for pine...
Aug 26 20:10:19 jim kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for pine...
I've never seen this error before but it doesnt seem to cause any
problems. Any ideas?
Regards, Jim.
