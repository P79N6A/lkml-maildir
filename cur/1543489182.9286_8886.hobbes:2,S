   Yes, it is, although I don't get to choose the binary format of
   data. And memory mapping is so much better than plain reading.
Actually, besides my per-load/store endianness selection, there is
another scheme (supported on UltraSparc, could be supported by IA-64,
I don't know).
There are often endianness selection bits in the page table entries,
add a new flag to mmap, and voila.
Later,
