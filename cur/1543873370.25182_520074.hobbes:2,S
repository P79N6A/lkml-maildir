Isn't that what is supposed to do KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE? Humm... I've got 
a feeling that it's not clear where the documentation is or that 
documentation is missing ;-)
IIRC, about a month ago someone already asked for precision on the 
meaning of some KEY_* . It would probably worth documenting more each 
key. More specifically, it could be interesting to decide if the keycode 
has to be associated to the physical symbol displayed on the key or 
associated to the function that the user (developer) expects when 
pressing this key.
