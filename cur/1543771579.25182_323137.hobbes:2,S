Cool.

Hmmmm... Ok, let's have some r8169 handwaving/advocacy/explanation to
tell what is going on.
- From a usability viewpoint, the PCI ID for the USRobotics adapter
  should be included. It has been reported around 10/04/2005.
  Consider the usual july/LKS/conf period and it will not be available
  in a stable serie before september (it is not a bugfix, it will not
  be in 2.6.12.x either). USR has cut the price: it will have some
  effect.
- The new features are not really new:
  o 03/2005 for Stephen Hemminger's stats + other changes
    -> it does not collide with existing functions. 
  o 03/2005 for the message level support
    -> not new but it will be noticed, yes.
- Some of the usual suspects on netdev know the code and even if your
  favorite r8169 maintainer has a real day job like everyone, I usually
  manage to dig the issues when something hits the fan (no engagement in
  sight, it helps :o) ).
Of course, you are free to ignore these points if you already took them
into consideration.
