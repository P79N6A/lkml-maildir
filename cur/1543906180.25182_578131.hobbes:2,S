Mechanically, I don't believe so.  I'm not sure I can find any reports
on it; however, I believe the power wastage SPI comes from the
transcievers and terminators.  There's the passive power from simply
powering the resistive bus and then the RMS power from sending commands
over an impedance circuit.  simple physics on a 5v bus tells me that the
former is likely to be far greater than the latter.  Finally, if you
think about what the bus is doing during signalling, the power drain is
independent of the frequency so I think the faster you squirt your data,
the lower the energy drain (hence high speed busses are actually lower
energy than low speed ones if the number of bits you have to transfer
remains constant).
