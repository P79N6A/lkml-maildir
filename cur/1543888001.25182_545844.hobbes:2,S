On both POWER4 and POWER4+, the Decrementer must be implemented such that 
requirements 1 to 3 below are satisfied. On POWER4, requirements 4 and 5 must 
also be satisfied.
1. The operation of the Time Base and the Decrementer is coherent, i.e., the 
counters are driven by the same fundamental time base.
2. Loading a GPR from the Decrementer shall have no effect on the accuracy of 
the Decrementer.
3. Storing a GPR to the Decrementer shall replace the value in the Decrementer 
with the value in the GPR.
4. Whenever bit 0 of the Decrementer changes from 0 to 1, an interrupt request 
is signaled. If multiple Decrementer interrupt requests are received before 
the first can be reported, only one interrupt is reported. The occurrence of a 
Decrementer interrupt cancels the request.
5. If the Decrementer is altered by software and the contents of bit 0 are 
changed from 0 to 1, an interrupt request is signaled.
    (4) clearly contradicts your point. I don't mind changing #ifdef though 
(so it'll cover all non Book E cases)
