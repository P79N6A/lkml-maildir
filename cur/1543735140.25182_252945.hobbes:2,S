Even this won't get us very far. Maybe we could probably find suitable
defaults for most modern hardware, but this still won't help users of
older or non-standard hardware.
For example,  remember LG's abuse of CACHE_FLUSH for firmware updates.
Here I've done some grepping over cdrecord and k3b:

Per device-type filters are unavoidable (unless we deny everything by
default).
This is especially true for MODE_SELECT. See here:

Why not deny everything and have a "smart" user space tool that assigns
filters to devices during startup? The tool's database could be updated
regularly by distributors.

IMHO all the more reason to keep all knowledge about individual devices
(and thus the need to provide updates) out of the kernel.
BTW: My impression was, that in the long term applications should be
adopted to work safely with increased capabilities. Is this still the
goal?
