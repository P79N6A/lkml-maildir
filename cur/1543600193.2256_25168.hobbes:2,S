Yes, I can see that using reverse mappings would be a way of correcting
the aging if you call page_age_up from try_to_swap_out, in which case
there probably needs to be a page_age_down on virtual mappings as well
to correctly balance things.

One other observation, we should add anonymously allocated memory to the
active-list as soon as they are allocated in do_nopage. At the moment a
large part of memory is not aged at all until we start swapping things
out.
