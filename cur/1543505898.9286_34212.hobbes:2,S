With the scheme I proposed, that can never happen.

Albert, you're solving a non-problem with that argument, so can I
clarify the situation:
 1. My understanding is that all of the boot loaders other than
    the one built into the kernel itself can already load kernels
    larger than 1M. So far, nobody has contradicted this claim,
    but if there is a boot loader that can't, please say so.
 2. Since the current kernel provides NO indication of the size
    of any kernel larger than 1M, boot loaders capable of loading
    suchlike kernels can't be getting the kernel size from any
    field within the kernel. This implies that there is no way
    that any patch I provide can break any such loader.
The consequence of the above two facts is that the ONLY way that an
incomplete kernel could be loaded is by trying to use the inbuilt boot
loader with a kernel larger than 1M in size, in which case the said
scenario is GUARANTEED to happen.
There IS a possible problem that we need to guard against, which is
the use of old utilities that can tweak the kernel parameter fields.
To the best of my knowledge, utilities such as rdev do not touch the
kernel size field, BUT I CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT.
It is because of THIS problem that I have chosen the route I have for
upgrading the inbuilt boot loader, and the basic consequence of that
possible problem is that we can NOT safely make use of the old size
field at all.
As a result, the design for the revised boot loader is as follows:
 1. If we are doing `make zImage` then use the current zImage
    boot loader, with a kernel size limit of 508k as currently.
    This is unchanged, and I see no need to change it. It will
    still use the current kernel size field since that is all
    that is needed in this case.
 2. If we are doing `make bzImage` then use the revised bzImage
    boot loader, which can happily handle kernels up to 15M in
    size. THIS is where my efforts are concentrated. It will
    make NO USE WHATSOEVER of the current kernel size field, but
    will instead refer exclusively to the new kernel size field.
    As a result, the value stored in the current kernel size
    field is completely irrelevant.
For reference, I believe that I have this all sorted out, but am
testing it before release to ensure that what I produce will actually
work. I have to admit that the need to generate a kernel between 1.1M
and 1.3M in size is proving difficult, but I expect this to be sorted
out later this week.
Comments?
Best wishes from Riley.
