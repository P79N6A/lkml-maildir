I also tried to reproduce your problem with Postfix (on a Debian
distro) but failed to
obtain the error message.
While googling for the error string, I found this link which report
the same kind of
error when Postfix is used with grsecurity (in 2006):

I barely understand German so I'm not sure it is related to your problem.
