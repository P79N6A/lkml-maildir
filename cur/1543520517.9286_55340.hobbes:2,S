Hello again...
Following up on my own post about problems talking to a ClearCase 3.2.1
view on Solaris 2.7 exported to a Linux 2.0 / 2.2 client.  Any attempt
to access the mount point hung the process.
The solution turned out to be adding a line to '/etc/system' on the
Solaris box, like:
nfs:nfs2_limit_inum=0
I found a hint similar to this searching through deja news, but the
poster had two mistakes:
  1) He referred to /etc/systems not /etc/system
  2) He left the underscores out.  It *does* make a difference.
In any case, add the 'nfs:nfs2_limit_inum=0' line to /etc/system,
reboot the Solaris box, and the world is a better place.
Question:  Does anybody know what the effect of this is?  Why does
it solve the problem?  The guy from Rational didn't give me a clear
answer, and I was wonderring what side-effects this will have.
Thanks.
-Nick
