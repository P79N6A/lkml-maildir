With some pending security fixes it's time to for a -stable update.  So,
here's 2.6.11.6, in the normal kernel.org places.  This includes some
security fixes, esp. one which closes a local root exploit in bluetooth.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.11.5 and 2.6.11.6, as it is small enough to do so.
thanks,
-chris
