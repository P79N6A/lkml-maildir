As things stand, both.

That is, unusual.  Unless each X server has it's own display, then when
switching VCs away from an X server the driver should be turned off, and
the device ungrabbed and possibly closed, at which point the other
should be able to open and grab the device.
The wacom X driver may not be handling that properly though, annoying.

That one has been mentioned a few times, but rarely complained about
loudly.
When I drew up the first evdev grab patches I made a masking patch
shortly later which helped divide things, however that never made it
into code and that leaves us here.

This is close to the original reason for grabbing, specificly that there
was no safe way to use evdev for the keyboard at all without it.
I can dust off the masking patch sometime here if Dmitry thinks that
he'd be willing to see a second method for this in addition to grabbing,
adding support to xf86-input-evdev would be trivial, and the same could
probably be said for the wacom driver that does grabbing at the moment.

>OK, fine. You're arguing semantics, though.
"arguing semantics" is not the same as "arguing nomenclature".  My DI
was very good at arguing semantics. He had this funny idea  that an
"unloaded" weapon was one that you had personally inspected  and that
the semantic difference mattered. Something about not  wanting to do
the paperwork of one of us killed someone with an  unloaded weapon.
Most technical debates are ultimately about semantics,  but that
doesn't mean that they are unimportant.
