Boring to do a "me too", but "me too".  We have four big production oracle
servers that could use 2.4 .  However, the test server we have put 2.4 on has
no end of ridiculous VM and OOM problems.
It seems bizarre that a 4GB machine with a working set _far_ lower than that
should be dying from OOM and swapping itself to death, but that's life in 2.4
land.
