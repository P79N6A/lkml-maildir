Yes that would help.
On Feb. 16th I asked a question and got no response. Here is what should 
have been included with the above patch.
Wolfgang Wander submitted a fix to address a mmap fragmentation issue. 
The git patch ( 1363c3cd8603a913a27e2995dccbd70d5312d8e6 ) is somewhat 
different and yields different results when running Wolfgang's test case 
leakme.c.
IMHO, the vm start and end address are swapped in arch_unmap_area and 
arch_unmap_area_topdown functions.
Prior to this patch arch_unmap_area() used area->vm_start and 
arch_unmap_area_topdown used area->vm_end in the git patch the following 
change showed up.
if (mm->unmap_area == arch_unmap_area)
     addr = prev ? prev->vm_start : mm->mmap_base;
else
     addr = vma ?  vma->vm_end : mm->mmap_base;
Using Wolfgang Wander's leakme.c test, I get the same results seen with 
his original "Avoiding mmap fragmentation" patch as I do after swapping 
  the start & end address in the above code segment. The patch I 
submitted  addresses this typo issue.
TIA,
Armin
