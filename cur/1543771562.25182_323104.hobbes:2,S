I do not :(
I have some motherboards with PCI Express slots, but I haven't been able
to find any Express cards around town anywhere.
Anyone have any pointers to a simple PCI express network card?  (no, I
don't want a PCI express video card, although if someone wants to send
me one I will not complain...)
thanks,
