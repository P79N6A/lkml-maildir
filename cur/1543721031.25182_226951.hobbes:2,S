Subject: [PATCH] Fix ppc64 out_be64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I notice that the latest BK has a fix for the bugs in ppc64's out_le64
that I just spent a few hours tracking down in 2.6.6, but out_be64 is
still broken.
This patch fixes two problems with out_be64:
 - The val parameter has to be unsigned long (not int), since it's 64 bits.
 - Since we're passing *addr into the asm as an output parameter, we
   should just use %0 instead of 0(%0) -- what's written won't even
   compile.
My ppc64 asm skills are nearly nonexistent but I'm pretty sure this
fix is needed and correct.
Thanks,
  Roland
