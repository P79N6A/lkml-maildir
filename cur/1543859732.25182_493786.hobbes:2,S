No.  Have a look at the other hugetlb_get_unmapped_area()
implementations.  Because this is in the get_unmapped_area() path,
'addr' is just a hint, so checking addr+len would give bogus
failures.  This test is, I believe, essentially an optimization - if
it fails, we're never going to find a suitable addr, so we might as
well give up now.

Yes - this is the very bug on which was causing crashes - the "caller
should have dealt with this" comment is wrong.  The test has been
moved into htlb_check_hinted_area() and now simply fails (and so falls
back to searching for a suitable address), rather than BUG()ing.
