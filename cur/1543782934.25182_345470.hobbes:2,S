I worry about this one. It's not really correct. The low en bits are 
"reserved", and while I don't know whether writing zero is always correct, 
I do know that just writing the low 4 bits with the old value is a bit 
strange. And the flags don't save the other bits.
So I'd prefer either my previous diff, or one that just re-reads the bits 
entirely, something like the appended..
What does the PCI spec say about the reserved bits? Do we have to save 
them?
