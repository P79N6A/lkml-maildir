Subject: [PATCH] 'noapic' already handled elsewhere
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I sent a previous patch to s/LOCAL_APIC/IO_APIC/, as Zwane noticed
my first patch needed that.  In that patch, I commented __setup()
would be better.
Well... line 718 of arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c _already_ handles this
case, using __setup() properly.
Word of warning... patch only compile tested, but seems obvious from
looking at io_apic.c.
BTW, why isn't ACPI using __setup() as well?  I don't see that ACPI
needs to patch arch/i386/kernel/setup.c at all.
