When I was done with the ROM I did this:
if (r->parent) {
	release_resource(r);
	r->flags &= ~PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE;
	r->end -= r->start;
	r->start = 0;
}
/* This will disable and set address to unassigned */
pci_write_config_dword(dev->pdev, PCI_ROM_ADDRESS, 0);
	
Then when I accessed them I did this:
/* assign the ROM an address if it doesn't have one */
if (r->parent == NULL)
	pci_assign_resource(dev->pdev, PCI_ROM_RESOURCE);
I believe I needed to do this because Xfree was enabling the ROMs
without telling the kernel. This caused the kernel resource struct to
get out of sync with the actual state of the ROM. 
If you set pci_dev->resource[PCI_ROM_RESOURCE] to C000:0 won't this
mess up pci_assign_resource()/release_resource()?
I wrote this code a while ago so I'm forgetting exactly why I did
things. There is a variation on this code in drivers/video/aty/radeon_base.c
