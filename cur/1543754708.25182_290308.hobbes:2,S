A global sysctl doesn't make much sense to me for this. If you
want to get some program running you don't want to impact your
system daemons. And a non root user couldn't enable it anyways,
which can be annoying if it is needed to get some binary working.
If anything I would make it a personality flag so that it can
be set per process.
