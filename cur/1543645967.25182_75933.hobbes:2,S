Hi Ingo,
I follow your reasoning, but one thing I don't follow -
+typedef struct work_s {
+       unsigned long pending;
+       struct list_head entry;
+       void (*func)(void *);
+       void *data;
+       void *wq_data;
+       timer_t timer;
+} work_t;
- why two names for the structure ("struct work_s" and "work_t")?
Either convention will work, but by declaring the structure twice it only
encourages users to employ their own favorite - thus defeating the purpose
of a convention.
Just curious,
-Kevin
