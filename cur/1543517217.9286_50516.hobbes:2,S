What about drivers that use the minor number to indicate instance number or
special modes of operation?
The major number is just something that the system uses to convert from the
user concept of 'open the device at this inode' into a table lookup. Device
drivers shouldn't care about their major number.
The minor number for some devices has been and continues to indicate
operating mode for certain devices.
