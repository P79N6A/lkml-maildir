one more small thing: could you please send your exact .config (Mike 
asked for that too, and i too on two prior occasions). Sometimes 
unexpected little details in the .config make a difference, we are not 
asking you that because we are second-guessing you in any way, the 
reason is simple: i frequently boot _the very .config that others use_, 
and see surprising reproducability of bugs that i couldnt trigger 
before. It's standard procedure to just pick up the .config of others to 
eliminate a whole bunch of degrees of freedom for a bug to hide behind - 
and your "it's a pretty standard config" description doesnt really 
achieve that. It probably wont make a real difference, but it's really 
easy for you to send and it's still very useful when one tries to 
eliminate possibilities and when one wants to concentrate on the 
remaining possibilities alone. Thanks again,
	Ingo
