This should fix the MADV_FREE code for PPC's hashed tlb.

I guess we'll need to call tlb_remove_tlb_entry() inside the
MADV_FREE code to keep powerpc happy.
Thanks for pointing this one out.

Oh dear.  I see it now...
The tlb end things inside zap_pte_range() are actually
noops and the actual tlb flush only happens inside
zap_page_range().
I guess the fact that munmap gets the mmap_sem for
writing should save us, though...
