Hi,
maybe this little patchlet can still make it into the running -rc? (no 
new compile warnings are thrown on x86_64 allyesconfig) - So that 
subsequent const-tagging patches can (successfully) find their way 
through the subsystems within the next cycle since they would depend on 
this one.

fs: make struct dentry->d_op const
This change will allow for tagging many dentry_operations const
in the source tree.
