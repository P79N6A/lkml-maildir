Be very careful about the Dell PERC controllers.  The 4-DI is *probably*
a rebranded LSI megaraid, with Dell's firmware.  You *definitely* want
to subscribe to the linux-megaraid-devel@dell.com list.  You well almost
certainly have to recompile your kernel with an up to the minute version
of the megaraid driver.  Problems with the stock driver include server
performance problems, crashes, inability to use clustering.  Many users
complain about the megamon utility, and have reverse engineered the
firmware api and written their own utility to get around the problems. 
The source isn't available AFAIK.  I don't think it will integrate with
linux-ha heartbeat for clustering very well.  Some people have tried
flashing the LSI firmware to fix things.
I am afraid to use it in a database cluster without a *log* of time to
debug.  The EVMS clustering support is getting stable, I am currently in
the testing phase for a postgresql cluster I am building with software
raid/Adaptec SCSI controllers, and shared disk array.
