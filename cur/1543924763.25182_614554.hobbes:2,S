Yeah, sorry, I just started converting mindlessly and stopped once it
compiled (which explains the missing FW bits, I don't have that in my
config). Then booted and fixed up what broke, well aside from the final
lockdep issue. As I couldn't get that fixed, I never looked twice,
didn't make it a proper patch-set, nor validated the rest of the patch.
Wasn't even planning on sending it out initially.

Right, lack of a recent -mm made me work against mainline. I'm sure I
would've noticed otherwise :-)
