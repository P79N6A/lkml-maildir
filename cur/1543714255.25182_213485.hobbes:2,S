I'm still getting a few warnings in JFS:
| jfs_mount.c:316: warning: `AIM_byte_addr' might be used uninitialized in this function
| jfs_mount.c:316: warning: `AIT_byte_addr' might be used uninitialized in this function
| jfs_mount.c:316: warning: `fsckwsp_addr' might be used uninitialized in this function
I don't understand why, though. Happens with both m68k-linux-gcc 2.95.2 and
3.2.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
