If the JVM spec says that it 'MUST' fail when used on a non-local address, 
and the POSIX spec for bind does not say that it 'MUST' fail, then yes, 
there is a bug in the JVM if it assumes that the two are compatible.
The fact that they just happen to behave the same in certain phases of the 
moon and on other operating systems is not relevant.
We may decide that we want to pander to this brokenness, especially given 
the widespread nature of the false assumption that bind() will fail when 
given a non-local address. But that doesn't make the JVM non-broken.
