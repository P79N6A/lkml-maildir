What about adding some functions such as enable_fpreg_syscalls() and
disable_fpreg_syscalls() that could be called before and after any floating
point operations? They could set a flag somewhere that would cause the
float registers to be saved/restored. Forgive me if this is somehow stupid.
I'm very much a kernel newbie.
