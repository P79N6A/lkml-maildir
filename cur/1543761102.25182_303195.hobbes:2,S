It takes only one proper implementation and the rest will follow. If
buses and devices can be implemented properly so can be calss_devices.
There is nothing magic about them.
Besides, if you divorce class device and the "meat" like that most of
the time you just ignoring the same problems that exist with the
"meat". Class is not useful by itself, it is additional attributes and
such that gets used. And with additional attributes you again have
your lifetime rules, refounting and such. In effect the change does
not buy you anything unless class interface is extremely limited.
