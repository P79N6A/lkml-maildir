 So that's just opposite to what ide-cd does, but I think ide-cd should be
limited to CD-like devices with their all properties (oddities).  
Specifically you can do random writes to an MO disk, perhaps even format
it, which is usually not the case with CDs.
 BTW, what does ide-scsi say of the device type for the MO: is it "CD-ROM"  
or "Direct-Access" or anything else?  I used an MO drive (a SCSI one --
nobody was crazy enough to think of an ATAPI interface for that kinds of
devices at that time) for a short while under Linux once and it used to be
the latter, with sd, not sr being the appropriate driver.
