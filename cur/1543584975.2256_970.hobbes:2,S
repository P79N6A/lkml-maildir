Hi!
  I had to give it some thought. I like to see this handles inside the
fbdev driver itself instead of inside fbcon. For 2.5.X it will be possible
to use /dev/fb with vgacon. Even better yet it will be possible to use
just a serial console and not use a VT but still use /dev/fb. So we will
want to to have fbdev doing power management itself. As for handling the
cursors I recently purposed a standardize cursor api so X can use it as
well via userland and a standard fbcon_cursor can be written. With this
api it would be easy to handle suspending and restoring the cursor for
fbcon for /dev/fb.
  As for fbcon knowing when it is asleep. Hum. We could have a flags to
tell it to have text data updates to be placed in the shadow buffer
(struct vc_datas->vc_screenbuffer) only;
