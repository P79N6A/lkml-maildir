Close, but I hadn't meant signing in mind, but something like "we write
we support Linux" when they only have 2.0 binary-only modules. I want
the term "Linux compatible" to be certified, not soft- or hardware per
se. Signing drivers is difficult, because of the said problems, and
because a faithful and trustworthy vendor then has to have his stuff
re-certified over and over.
I you happened to read the German c't magazine 1/2003 about RAID
hardware and Linux, or the 2/2003 edition about TV cards, then look at
the pertinent sections to know what I mean.
The other thing (Linus labs) is already there: module tainting...
