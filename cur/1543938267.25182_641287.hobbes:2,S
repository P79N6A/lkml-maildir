Timeout, timeout, timeout, reset, timeout.. (repeat), failed I/O
This gives the end user no information about the fault, nor does it let
the upper layers of SCSI and above distinguish between a random passing
sulk and media errors which need the disk replacing.

PATA controllers don't lock up in that case so its quite easy. The one
exception is if the device jams IORDY but in that case you are dead
anyway the next I/O (except on a SIL680 which has a timer we could use).
Old IDE says it works for PATA. For SATA I can see it might need more
care and you might simply not be able to get the info.
