Well, some of that stuff should already happen earlier (and included from 
the arch Kconfig files), but that doesn't work for everything.
I don't think that simply allowing to parse a file multiple times is the 
right answer, as it duplicates a lot of data. A simple example would be 
help texts, right now they are per symbol, but they should really be per 
menu, so archs can provide different help texts for something.
"source" should become a bit more intelligent and parse a file only once 
and link the data into the menu structure.

Define "accept".
The basic rule for choice values must not be violated - none of them may 
depend on another value in the same group. The dependency tree allows for 
no loops, these choice groups allow for the only exception, but it has to 
stay within that group.
One option I'm thinking about is to extend that group by naming the choice 
option, so kconfig knows they are related. This won't work for everything, 
so quite some renaming may be needed.
