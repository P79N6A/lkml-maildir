Subject: [PATCH] task containersv11 add tasks file interface fix for cpusets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>
The code in kernel/cgroup.c attach_task() which skips the
attachment of a task to the group it is already in has to be
removed.  Cpusets depends on reattaching a task to its current
cpuset, in order to trigger updating the cpus_allowed mask in the
task struct.
The dependency of cpusets on this is a hack, granted, but an
important one.  It lets us avoid checking for a changed cpuset
'cpus' setting in critical scheduler code paths.
