It's not "obvious errors", as it's actually "non-obvious features". The 
	movl %ax,%ds
thing actually used to generate the right (32-bit) move on gas, and
	movw %ax,%ds
used to generate the WRONG (16-bit) move on gas.
The reason the 32-bit move is the right one is that both the 32-bit and
the 16-bit moves actually do the same thing (the target register is a
16-bit register after all), but the 32-bit move does so in smaller space
and faster due to the lack of a size override.
I'd like somebody to sacrifice their first-borne son, and write in blood
that gas does the right thing every time these days. Otherwise I will keep
the thing that looks strange but has a real explanation for it.
