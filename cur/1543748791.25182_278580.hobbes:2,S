Greetings,
Fortunately with this -rc3-mm1 I no longer have the acpi_power_off problem that
I had in -rc2-mm's, described in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/12/110
 .
OTOH, while I had no problems with the previous mm's or with 2.6.10-rc3, with
- -rc3-mm1 kdm has an weird function: with kdm/unstable uptodate 4:3.3.1-3 from
Debian it just restarts X when it's going to show the login/password form,
restarting over and over.
If further info is needed on this issue just ask: meanwhile I'll try to find
which patch in -mm is doing this...
