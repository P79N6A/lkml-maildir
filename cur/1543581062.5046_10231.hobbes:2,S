Hi,
  I'll try it today, though I'm not sure that it will fix lost last
dword on read. But at least it should stop corruption on write...
  After your mail I noticed that there is couple of `unsettable'
options in BIOS, and I did not tried switching BIOS from optimal to
slow setting yet, so maybe there are more broken optimizations?
  I'll keep you informed.
                                    Thanks,
                                        Petr Vandrovec
