This is sort of what we already do for REPORT_LUNS (except that we use
lun 0 instead of the REPORT LUN well known lun).  What additions do you
want to see?

gendisk is actually used to facilitate the SCSI ULD infrastructure; bsg,
being block, doesn't actually use it, so we'd still only have two.

The benefits outweigh the costs ... in the same way that we have a block
queue above all the character devices so we can treat SCSI queueing in a
uniform fashion regardless of device.
