Yes, for the atomic versions we don't care if we're asking gcc to
generate trashy code (even though I'd have wanted to only disallow
problematic optimizations -- ones involving the passed bit-string
address -- there, and allow other memory references to be optimized
as and how the compiler feels like it) because the atomic variants
are slow anyway and we probably want to be extra-safe there.
But for the non-atomic variants, it does make sense to remove the
memory clobber (and the unneeded __asm__ __volatile__ that another
patch did -- for the non-atomic variants, again).
OTOH, as per Linus' review it seems we can drop the "memory" clobber
and specify the output operand for the extended asm as "+m". But I
must admit I didn't quite understand that at all.
[ I should probably start reading gcc sources, the docs are said to
  be insufficient/out-of-date, as per the reviews of the patches. ]
