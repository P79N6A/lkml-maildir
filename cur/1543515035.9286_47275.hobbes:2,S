Interesting... I have an H+ and I'll agree... it sucks. Worst thing was
when I tried it in my NT SMP box... resource contention anyone? Anyways,
Sigma has actually said they are producing Linux drivers for it (in fact
the slashdot article on DVD when CSS decryption was cracked has a reply
from Sigma posted that states just this). My guess is the drivers will
be binary only though so I guess they really won't exist as far as I
care.
Livid I believe has docs for some of the Zoran based DVD cards (anyone
know which cards those are?) so that's probably the way to go if cards
are any good.
