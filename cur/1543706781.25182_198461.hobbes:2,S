Not true.  Filenames in Unix are defined as
3.169 Filename
  A name consisting of 1 to {NAME_MAX} bytes used to name a file. The
  characters composing the name may be selected from the set of all
  character values excluding the slash character and the null byte. The
  filenames dot and dot-dot have special meaning. A filename is
  sometimes referred to as a   pathname component  .
Only NUL and / are special.
