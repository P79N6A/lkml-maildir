Thanks Roland. I need a time to understand your explanation (I even printed
it to read in metro ;). I'll return tomorrow.
A quick note right now:

I thought abot something like that too.
However, SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED doesn't relaible with ptrace. I mean, ptracer
doesn't clear SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED. This is btw one of the problems which
complicates fixing do_wait(WSTOPPED).
As for SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPING... I am dreaming to find the way to eliminate
this lock-drop in get_signal_to_deliver(). Not sure this is possible, but
it is so nasty. For example, SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED is racy, and I don't know
how to fix this. The patch we discussed some time ago doesn't really work
because dequeue_signal() drops the lock too. The latter is fixable afaics,
but needs very ugly changes.
Oleg.
