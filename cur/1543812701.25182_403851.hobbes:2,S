A number of architectures have a pagesize greater than 4K.  Most
(OK, sample size of 2) mkfs programs default to using 4K blocksizes.
So, any/all platforms not having a 4K pagesize will be disadvantaged.
Search on the definition of PAGE_SHIFT in asm-*/page.h and for all
platforms where its not defined to 12, this will hurt.
cheers.
