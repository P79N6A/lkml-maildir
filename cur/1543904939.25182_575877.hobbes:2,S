I'm not running setserial on the port, myself.  But to test to see if it 
is related, I included this code in the application:
#include <linux/serial.h>
....
struct serial_struct serial;
ioctl(modemFd, TIOCGSERIAL, &serial);
traceModemOp("modem xmit_fifo_size: %u", serial.xmit_fifo_size);
And I get this resulting logging:
"MODEM modem xmit_fifo_size: 16"
So it's clear from here that the xmit_fifo_size is set correctly on this 
system.
Thanks,
Lee.
