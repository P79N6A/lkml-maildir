so...  will this permit us to generate kdump files whcih don't have any
pagecache or anonymous memory in them?

This should have suitable __attribute__s so that the compiler can check its
use.    See many examples in include/linux/kernel.h, around line 120.

Please always run scripts/checkpatch.pl against your diffs.

unsigned int = size_t?  Perhaps vmcoreinfo_max_size should have size_t
type?

open-coded access to xtime probably isn't appropriate here.  Consider using
get_seconds().  That might be more accurate on tickless kernels, too.

I expect the virtualisation guys would be bothered by an open-coded access
to UTS_RELEASE.  I guess it doesn't matter much here, but perhaps it'd be
setting a better example to use init_uts_ns.name.release?
