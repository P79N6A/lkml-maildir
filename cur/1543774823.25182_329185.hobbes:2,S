If I didn't care about performance.  I will read up on how FUSE works,
though, to see if there's anything in the _kernel_ code that would be
useful.

Right.  Kernel people hate change.  Got it.
No, seriously, I have to respect the history involved, which is why I'm
not pretending to know more than I do.

Not as much as you think.  Unless a lot of applications can't handle
opening or saving files that have '...' in the pathname?
The sysadmin problem doesn't worry me so much.

Agreed.  I don't know enough about VFS to propose one, though.  I think
others are working on that, finally.

Not too much, I hope.
Although being able to use different keys on a per-file basis would be
nice.  I'm not sure if that would work in the existing system.  Not to
mention that keys would also be handlable with '...', if/when it happens.
