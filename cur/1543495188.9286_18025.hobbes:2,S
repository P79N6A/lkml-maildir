I got a similar problem just now on a Western Digital 3.2 GB disk.  It
occurred while testing Andre Hedrick's patches, but I was able to reproduce
it on a vanilla 2.2.7 system.  The command line was
  hdparm -c 3 -t -d1 -X34 /dev/hda
After a few seconds I got:
  hda: timeout waiting for DMA
and then nothing.  Every key sequence was dead.  After two nostalgic minutes
contemplating how standard this was under MS-DOS, I reached for the reset
switch.
hdparm is 3.3.  I think there are newer versions, but I take what Debian
gives me.  Without the "-X34" it works fine, but I'm new to this, so I was
following the suggestions in the man pages.  In any case, I guess the crash
is not what's meant to happen.
As with Vasilios, I can test any solutions on my crash-and-burn system.
Only limit is how much time my wife will let me spend in front of the PC
:-(.
