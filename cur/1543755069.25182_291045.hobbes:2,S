No, XAA is normally used for 2D acceleration.  This is hardware
accelerated but doesn't use DRI, X does 2D accel by talking directly to
the hardware without the kernel's involvement.
This is an area where the proprietary guys are a little ahead but there
are some interesting developments like the Xgl server.
