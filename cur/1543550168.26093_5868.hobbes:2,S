Thats how it works. There are reasons for doing it this way. These sound boards
support legacy mapping of legacy device emulation stuff. If you dont have an
ISA card then its rather nice to have it enabled, but if we blindly enable
it you _cannot_ disable it on the ISA device it collides with.
In general yes you are right, but this is one of the ugly cases. And while the
bits are disabled the address is truely free for the ISA device to use
