 Now that you mention the penguin, I was reminded of something.
 Normally with this box, when the fb starts, the top 3rd of the
 screen has a large white rectangle blitted onto it for reasons
 I never figured out. Its purely cosmetic (it disappears when scrolling
 begins), so it wasn't something I really bothered investigating.
 It could be that with your reworking, this bug has taken on
 a new form, and is now doing something more dramatic.
