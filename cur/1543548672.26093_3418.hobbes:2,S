Without patching the kernel, I think I can show that there is something
basically wrong. The patch may just hide the problem.
Something seems to be wrong, even with using the first virtual
terminal, which is a 'tty' and should (must) be able to become a
a controlling terminal.
Here is a trace:
getpid()                                = 6
open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)    = 3
fcntl(3, F_GETFL)                       = 0x802 (flags O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)
fcntl(3, F_SETFL, O_RDWR)               = 0
dup2(3, 0)                              = 0
dup2(3, 1)                              = 1
dup2(3, 2)                              = 2
ioctl(3, TIOCSCTTY)                     = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
close(3)                                = 0
This is a stock kernel version 2.2.15. The stuff necessary to make
'strace' run ends up with the 'init' PID of 6. FYI, it is a real
bear to 'strace' init's startup.
I haven't a clue why a UID/GID=0 process can't acquire a controlling
TTY.
