wine mixes both approches, we have (to control what's generated inside the 
various exception) to ptrace from our NT-kernel-like process (the ptracer) to 
get the context of the exception. Restart from the ptracer is done with 
PTRACE_SINGLESTEP.
(BTW: I also CC:ed wine-devel ML, that might be of interest to them too)
