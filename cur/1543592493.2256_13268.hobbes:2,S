Hmm nope - /proc/bus/pci has two entries '00' and devices
Devices has 5 lines in it; corresponding to the real 5 devices.
The 00 directory has 5 files in it.
Hmm - ah - cancel the report - I've just got pciutils 2.1.8 down and it is
now happy.  Should there be a version ref for pciutils in
Documentation/Changes?
