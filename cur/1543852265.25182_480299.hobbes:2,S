If I understand the first answer correctly, there actually is:
----  snip  ----
This agreement is primarily intended for Novell's customers. It doesn't
imply or guarantee that you are *not* sued. An exception may be if you
are a customer of Novell, than M$ will not sue you *directly*.
So for all Non-Novell customers: You may be sued directly from M$ (and
from all others).
So for all: You may be sued indirectly by M$ (and directly from all
others).

SCNR,
