No, that's exactly the case that mmiowb() was designed to protect 
against.  It ensures that your writes have arrived at the destination 
bridge, which means after that point any other CPUs writing to the same 
device will have their data actually hit the device afterwards.  
Hopefully deviceiobook.tmpl makes that clear...
