Your patch creates a hole in Linux's virtual address space, but your
card needs a hole in the physical RAM, or it will conflict with chips
in that range. I think there's no way to do this with a machine that
has more than 12M of RAM. 
But then again, you have Linux, an OS that runs fine with even 12M of
RAM :)
