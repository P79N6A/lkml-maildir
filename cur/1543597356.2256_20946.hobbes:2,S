Except it is completely ignored by the preprocessor.
    2) if you are coming up with a -new- token, realize that
       kernel-private stuff is the common case, and use
       LIBC_KERNEL_SHARED_{BEGIN,END} instead
Sure, whatever works... the points I am trying to make are:
  * Don't pollute kernel headers with unnecessary pre-processor junk.
  * Give the LIBC people the power to choose which parts of the
    headers they ingore and otherwise.
  * Linus et al, can merge patches from LIBC people knowing they
    should only affect LIBC, not the kernel.
It doesn't matter what the token(s) is/are --- by making them comments
and invisible to the kernel is make life easier.
Also, if the LIBC people want something like:
        typedef unsigned int uint32_t;
then it could look like:
        /* LIBC_ONLY_BEGIN
        typedef unsigned int uint32_t;
        LIBC_ONLY_END */
or whatever. All the libc specific stuff hidden in comments, and
shared stuff indictaed by comments.  A simple script can then produce
LIBC suitable headers from the kernel ones.
