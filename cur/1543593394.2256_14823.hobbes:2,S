OK I think I have a solution... Whenever I need to re-allocate or free the
DMA buffer, I could set all of the user's corresponding page table entries
to deny all access. Then I'd get a page fault on the next access to the
buffer, and inside nopage() I could update the user's mapping or send a
SIGBUS as appropriate (hmm, just like restoring a file mapping that was
thrown away)... So I just have to figure out how to find the user's page
table entries that are pointing to the DMA buffer.

Dan
