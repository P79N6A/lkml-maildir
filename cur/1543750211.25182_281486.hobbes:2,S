Absolutely, there is no way this patch actually helps for
full sized frames.  Another thing in the above equations is
that on output you have to add in MAX_TCP_HEADER which is
128 + MAX_HEADER. MAX_HEADER is variable sized based upon
which link layer support is built into the kernel.
Even on input, many ethernet device drivers add in their
own amounts to the size for DMA and cache-line alignment.
So this special slab would never be used on output even
if it got the base equations correct.
If we are really going to do something like this, it should
be calculated properly and be determined per-interface
type as netdevs are registered.
Special casing ethernet is just rediculious.
