You are right, the on-disk encoding is filesystem specific. E.g., it is 
always UCS-2 for CIFS, NTFS and VFAT (and my patch doesn't change this).
It is exposed as a mount parameter and kernel configuration option only for 
fat and smbfs (the two filesystems that my patch touches for this matter), 
and both of these filesystems come from DOS days, where there was one 
codepage for a given country. So, for me, it made sense to glue these two 
parameters, because they both should be set to this codepage. The contrary 
would (AFAIK) only make sense if one gets floppies from France, but 
communicates with Polish SMB servers. It is a very rare situation, isn't it? 
Or do you know any other example where it would clearly make sense to have 
different defaults for fat and smbfs?
