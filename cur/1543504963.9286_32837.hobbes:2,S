Part of the problem is that everybody knows that your task must be
overwhelming. So people are trying to offload you.
However somehow, you seem to want it in a way that intuitively people
think would cause you more work in the end. Wanting to offload you,
leads to people doing it the wrong way.
I've sent you one big patch today, one (hopefully) finished driver.  I
could've fed you version 1.7 and the following 18 patches. Now I just
sent you version 1.26. I really think that developing a driver this
way without bothering you for every typo is better. (If you really want
the intermediate versions too, tell me. Next one coming up soon....)

I think that the ISDN "peer-review" is taking place on different
mailing lists than what you (and I) read. 
Let me conclude by saying that you're doing a good job, and that I'm
not attacking you. I'm just trying to say that I think I understand
why it is happening like this.
