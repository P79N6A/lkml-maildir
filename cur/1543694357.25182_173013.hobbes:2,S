sure. I think I already explained there are downsides in disabling the
oom killer for desktops where the offender task is normally the biggest
one too, but those downsides aren't something I care about given the
cases it gets right w/o it (i.e. huge-shm-SGA/mlock/oomdeadlocks). the
oom killer can do the wrong decision too sometime, and more
systematically as well.
