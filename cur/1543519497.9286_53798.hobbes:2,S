Hi !
While working on MacOnLinux (sort of VWWare-like runtime environement to
run MacOS within Linux/PPC), Samuel Rydth found the following issue with
2.2.x kernels. Is this a normal behaviour, a known bug or a PPC-specific
issue I should look into more details ?

Btw. I found an oddity with the IDE block device interface
(causes problems with DropStuffit in MacOS 9). In a sequence like
	write	A to sector N
	write	B to sector N
	read	     sector N
then the read might not return the information "B" (but something
else). I've always assumed that the block device drivers were 
supposed to enforce this consistency but I might be wrong. Everything 
work as it should if an extra "fsync" is inserted after each
write. This might impact driver performance though.
