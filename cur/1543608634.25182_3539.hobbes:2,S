I don't agree. BNF is basically the only proper and efficient way for a 
nice formal descrition of a LR parsable language. No accident most
programming
languages out there are defined in some sort of BNF.

Short answer: yes I know them, yacc bison pure flex and lex whatever,
and 
I used to use them for job projects not just toys. Trust me they are
the only proper practical way to define the syntax of something parsable
and beeing complete about it. Unless you wan't to reach the stability of
the usual perl-web hackkery.
