        linux-2.3.28/drivers/i2o/i2o_lan.c contains two references to
i2o_event_register.c, one of which is commented out with "#if 0...#endif".
The other one apparently was commented out, but the "#if 0...#endif"          
statements themselves were commented out, generating a reference to the
undefined routine i2o_event_register.
