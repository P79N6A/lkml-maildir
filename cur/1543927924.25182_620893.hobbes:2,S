The one reason I can think of that you might want that behavior is if
you know you only access a given piece of the filesystem from one client
at a time, and you still want inotify to work in that situation.  (I'm
assuming inotify still notifies you of changes that are made on the same
client.)
But maybe you could handle that case by allowing inotify_add_watch() in
the case where the nfs filesystem was mounted with the "nolock" option,
and failing it otherwise, and telling people to turn on nolock if
they're sure they know what they're doing.
