It seems that the ppp driver is subject to a similar phenomenon as
we are observing in the isdn driver:
The ppp channel calls ppp_output_wakeup() from interrupt, which in turn pulls
a new skb from the ppp xmit queue and passes it finally downstream via
ppp_send_frame(). All this occurs from interrupt context -- a fact which is
somewhat hidden in the code (naively, one would assume the same context as
in dev->hard_start_xmit()). Thus, any kfree_skb() in the lower xmit path
is potentially called from interrupt context.
