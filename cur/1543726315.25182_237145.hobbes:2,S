OK, I still can't work out why this is happening. Can you try with
2.6.8-rc2-mm1? Does it happen continually after the system has booted?
If it happens in 2.6.8-rc2-mm1, comment out the call to cpu_attach_domain
in kernel/sched.c (so you'll only be using the dummy boot-up domain).
Does that fix it?
