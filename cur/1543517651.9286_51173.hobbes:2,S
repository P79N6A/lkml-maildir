Can anyone tell me where the default bh->b_end_io value is set in 2.2.*
kernels? (it's the "end buffer io" function in the buffer heads).
I can only find init_buffer that seems to set it, and nowhere can I
find init_buffer used in the block devices or fs hierarchy. Yet
bh->b_end_io must be set everywhere because it's used in the default
end_request.
It's a mystery!
On a similar note, if anyone knows if the OO feature of an b_end_io
function per buffer_head is used anywhere in 2.2.*?  I can understand it
being per device, but can't see a per b/h usage anywhere.  Can I assume
that there is only one b_end_io per device?
Peter
