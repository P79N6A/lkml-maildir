You're actually talking about driver model convention, which is that
if a driver for a device is missing, we do not return an error - a
hotplug event (or whatever is the flavour of the month) might provide
a driver.
For example, you might have a SMC91x device on your board, and you
may have chosen to build the driver as a module.  You wouldn't want
the device to not register.
Why should a driver registering its own platform device be treated
any different (from any platform provided device or indeed the rest
of the device/driver model)?
