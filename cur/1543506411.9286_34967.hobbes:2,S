Sorry, I was slightly taken away by the subject, I fear this went a
little too offtopic.

HOLY SH*! (sorry). You don't mean that for real, do you? This would
completely break C and Unix and whatever else paradigm. If dealing with
pointers you'd have to know to which segment the pointer belongs: Is this
a pointer to a user or lib function, is this a pointer to a variable on
stack, userspace or in the lib. You could make the compiler use some
larger pointers, but as the 24:32 is probably again not a unique mapping
(because 24+32 > 36; I mean several selector:offset combinations refer to
the same memory location) it will be a pain for pointer arithmetic.
Yes, I know, generations of real mode compilers worked this way, and it
was a pain in the ass for anyone.

A lot of soft? It will break ANY C-program except special applications.

At least this does not break all programs and moves the burden of dealing
with the kludge to those apps that really want it. Better yet, simply
allow to run several (max 4G) apps using all real mem you have and write a
parallel/distributed program if you need more than 4G of memory.

The major point is, due to the majority of memory problems with any kind
on Win, even NT, I really doubt a 16GB NT server can do anything better
than a 1GB linux machine. Heck, I see daily that an NT with 128GB slows to
a crawl doing simple things like editing an ASCII file and running a
serial terminal emulator which run like a charm on my old 486 with 32.
THEY need this cludge to deal with even the simplest applications, WE
don't.
NT needs this memory NOW, because they already fail in standard
situations. Other than that, it's only a temporary kludge, they can't push
it ad infinitum. It might work for 16GB, maybe for 32 or 64 (oh, you said
its 36 bit only, so we are already at the limit of the kludge when we
start to implement it). But then? Due to the memory waste of MS, intel is
at the limit now. Either they move to a real 64 architecture (or something
x between 16 & 64; 8 byte per pointer definitely bloat programs) now with
the hacks it needs to support virtual 8068 and now maybe virtual protected
mode, or they don't and die. 
So, we either wait for a 64bit intel, as we don't need this hack now, or
move to Alpha or Power when intel fails. Oh.. we are already on Alpha and
Power(maybe not the recent ones). So what. The linux hobbyist can run on
a cheap 4GB or less intel, if you need a professional system, just use
another architecture. As all uses plain C(++) paradigm and Unix, it's not
too difficult to write applications running on all these machines.
