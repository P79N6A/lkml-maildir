This is indeed half of the most elegant solution I can find. The other
half is CAP_MKNOD (which I think POSIX says we should have anyway), so
that root can't make an identical, non-immutable device file.
HOWEVER, chattr/lsattr on device files doesn't seem to work on my system.
This is probably because some of the ext2 flags don't make sense on block
devices (append only, secure delete, etc). This is no reason to ban the
perfectly reasonable immutable flag though
Cheers
