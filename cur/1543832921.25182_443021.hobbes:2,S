Subject: [PATCH 5/7] AVR32: Always enable CONFIG_EMBEDDED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/11/187

If CONFIG_EMBEDDED is not defined, we are unable to deselect some
options which are unnecessary on most AVR32 setups. This patch
unconditionally selects CONFIG_EMBEDDED so that "make allnoconfig"
produces something closer to a minimal setup.
