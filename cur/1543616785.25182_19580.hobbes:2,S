I have not done deeper research on the codepaths, but I have tested the
drivers after change and they work. I tried to look for for/while {
usleep(n); } timeout waits and no dangerous looking spinlocks held or
interrupts disabled.
I'm ready to do more extensive work to fix similar cases if I get
theoretical "OK" for the changes. I won't continue if people point out that
this is wrong way(tm).
The patch is quick hack for my own use and for review and shouldn't be used
unless proven correct. It's just my first try to hack linux kernel... :)
I just dislike
while (!hardware_completed()) usleep(1000);
-style code in some drivers (a bit extreme example).
