IIRC, the FUA bit only forces THAT request to hit the platter before it 
is completed; it does not flush any previous requests still sitting in 
the write back queue.  Because all io before the barrier must be on the 
platter as well, setting the FUA bit on the barrier request means you 
don't have to follow it with a flush, but you still have to precede it 
with a flush.

How isn't it block layer breakage?  If the device does not support 
barriers, isn't it the job of the block layer ( probably the scheduler ) 
to fall back to flush-write-flush?
