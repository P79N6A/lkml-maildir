Well, this have been in-lab testing to fight driver bugs/errata on early
rlease kernels, I'm talking about the context of a released solution
with stable drivers/hw.

Yah, those are a pain. But then, it isn't the context described by
Nguyen where the driver "knows" about the errata and how to recover.
It's the context of a bug where the driver does not know what's going on
and/or doesn't have the proper workaround. My point was more that there
are very few cases where a driver will have to do recovery of PCI error
in known cases where it actually expect an error to happen.

Yes, but it will be logged at least, so we'll spot a lot of these during
our tests.
