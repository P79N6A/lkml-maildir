#Hey now, I think that's a pretty damn good idea.  I've been seriously

Hello,
I came across your webpage, and it appears that it has very fault HTML in it
that cannot be read in any situation but Internet Explorer running under
Microsoft Windows.
I'm sorry about making such a big deal about this (my therapist says I have
a compulsive anal retentive peronality), but these pages seem to last
forever, and you really ought to fix them.
Now, what I use for fixing these little things is a little utility called
'format', which formats your HTML...
:-)
