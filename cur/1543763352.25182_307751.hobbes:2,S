For USB devices and their interfaces that's generally wrong.  But it is 
right for lots of other devices (including USB host controllers).

The parent's semaphore _would_ be taken before its probe() method is
called and the children are discovered, since the semaphore is held during
every driver callback.  However that's not what I was getting at above.
The problem with USB comes in at the level of drivers for interfaces.  
Occasionally these drivers need to do something during their probe() that
affects the entire USB device (as opposed to just their interface), such
as resetting the device.  For this to work safely it requires that the
driver own the lock for the entire device, not just the lock for the
interface.
Often this works out okay because the driver's probe() is called when the
interface is registered by the USB core.  At that time the core already
owns the device lock, so driver->probe() inherits the lock.
The problem arises when driver->probe() is called because the driver was
just insmod'ed.  At such times the USB core does not own any locks on any
USB devices.  The only way for driver->probe() to inherit the device lock
is for the driver-model core to acquire it beforehand -- it's not possible
for the USB core or the driver to lock the device.  That's why I asked for
driver_attach() to lock dev->parent->sem around the call to
driver_probe_device().
