That's the option 4 case in my original mail.  Are you suggesting that 
it would have been the better option to adopt?  If so, why?
I don't like it because (leaving aside the active/expired array issues) 
it would move the X top priority tasks across where X is the number of 
tasks required to meet the requirement.  If we could arrange for it to 
skip every second one without making the code too complicated (i.e. 
there'd be a possible need for multiple passes until the required load 
was moved).

Good point.  this_min_prio should probably be initialized to the minimum 
of this_rq->curr->prio and this_rq->best_expired_prio rather just using 
this_rq->curr->prio.

How so.  At most one task per move_tasks() will be moved as a result of 
this code that wouldn't have been moved otherwise.  That task will be a 
high priority task stuck behind a higher priority task on its current 
queue that will be the highest priority on its new queue causing a 
preempt and access to the CPU.  I wouldn't call this unnecessary.

Yes, I think we're getting there.
I think we need changes to try_to_wake_up() to help high priority tasks 
find idle CPUs or CPUs where they would preempt when they wake up. 
Leaving this to the load balancer is bad for these tasks latencies.  I 
think that this change needs to be done independently of smpnice as it 
would be useful even without smpnice.  I'm hoping Ingo or Nick will 
comment on this proposal.
It would also help if you fixed the active load balance code so that 
it's not necessary to distort normal load balancing to accommodate it. 
I haven't had time to look at it myself (other than a quick glance) yet.
