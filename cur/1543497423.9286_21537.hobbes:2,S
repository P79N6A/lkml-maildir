If you have tried to respond to this (slightly edited) mail, I truly
apologize.  I forgot to reset my Pine configuration to give a real
address on the From header.
-----------------------------
I have been doing a regular kernel update to 2.2.9, and did the usual
Debian 2.0 (hamm) kernel compilation procedures (make-kpkg).  It compiled
fine. But when I started working with my soundcard (OPTi931), after the
modules are loaded in, I get all sorts of strange
Cannot execute binary file: /usr/foo" errors.  Often, the core files that
handle shutdown, including init, cannot be run again, because of such
errors.  I have lost much time recovering from this.  There is no
permanent filesystem damage (except when I had to hard reboot, because
init couldn't shutdown and umount couldn't be run).
This problem started shortly after I upgraded from 2.2.7 to 2.2.9.  There
were never any problems before; in fact, the .config file was a direct
copy.
I tried to downpatch back to 2.2.6, but the same errors occurred.  I
downloaded linux-2.2.1.tar.bz2 off the kernel.org mirrors, repatched
to 2.2.4, and used the gcc-2.7.2.3 included in hamm, but still the error
occurs.
I have isolated the problem to the MAD16 driver, which I compiled as a
module.  Though I do not know how to fix it, I have tested (logged in
standalone, started insmoding individual modules) and am certain that the
filesystem reading errors start when mad16.o is loaded.  Even more silly
is the fact that executables I have already run are not affected; if I
used the "ls" command before I try to modprobe the module in, the ls
command still works.
My soundcard is an OPTi931 PnP card with the onboard MPU401 chip.  I am
currently using it with the following in my conf.modules:
options mad16 io=0x530 irq=7 dma=0 dma16=1 mpu_io=0x330 mpu_irq=5
My isapnp.conf has corresponding parameters.  Also, I compiled the program
included in linux/Documentation/sound/Opti and set the post-install
directive in conf.modules.
This kernel is being compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3 and I am running a libc6
2.0.7 system.  I am running a good version of modutils, bash, and all the
other utils.
I thank you for your time.  Please respond with any ideas on fixing this,
or if you need more information.
