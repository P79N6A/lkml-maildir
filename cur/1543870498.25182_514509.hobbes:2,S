Paul Menage had suggested something very similar in response to the RFC
for memory controllers I sent out and it was suggested that we create
small zones (roughly 64 MB) to avoid the issue of a zone/node not being
a shareable across containers. Even with a small size, there are some 
issues. The following thread has the details discussed.

RSS accounting is very easy (with minimal changes to the core mm),
supplemented with an efficient per-container reclaimer, it should be
easy to implement a  good per-container RSS controller.
