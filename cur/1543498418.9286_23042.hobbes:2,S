Yeah, getting past it was easy, but I wanted to make sure it was known. 
CONFIG_ALPHA_AVANTI disables SMP, so I didn't have much trouble after
that.
"bunzip2 -c xx | tar" and kernel compiles still occasionally crash my
machine, dropping me back to SRM with a "kernel stack not valid" error. 
We'll see if that happens until 2.2.10, it does until 2.2.9 and 2.3.x...
