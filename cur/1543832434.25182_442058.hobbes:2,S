I agree for uncompressed images - I tried timing the writing of the image 
yesterday. I'm not sure about LZF though, because I couldn't get it to 
resume. I'd be interested to see it really be as fast as suspend2 with 
compression.

Sure, but it will mean more if all of the tests are run on the same system, so 
I'll have another go at getting uswsusp to resume, when I get the chance.
