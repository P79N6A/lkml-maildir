How about other features?  In particular, do the client/server do 
authentication (krb5? lipkey/spkm3?), integrity and privacy?
Also, are any patches on Citi's site useful anymore?  I see patches for 
2.6.0-test1, but nothing more recent.  Have they been folded into the main 
tree?

Neato!  Those of us with hordes of machines using Linux's NFS appreciate the 
extra effort.
