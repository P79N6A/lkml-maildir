Something else that needs fixing is pcmcia-cs has its exclude list
for the RadeonIGP bug set way too wide.
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts has..
exclude port 0x380-0x3ff
Which is bad news, as the Vaio wants port 0x386. The actual ports that
cause problems are 0x3b0->0x3bb and 0x3d3
After fixing this, it detects the drive, but hangs when you try and
mount it.
