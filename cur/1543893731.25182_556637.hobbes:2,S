RapidIO address width is 34bits, so we use <2> for #address-cells.
"0 0" is the RapidIO bus address, since the #address-cells is 2, it's
double zero. "c0000000" is the parent bus address, which is memory
address. "20000000" is the size.
So, they means mapping the address of memory 0xc0000000 to RapidIO bus
address 0x0 and the size is 0x20000000.

Sorry, there is no documentation now. But I'll post an example for using
them.
