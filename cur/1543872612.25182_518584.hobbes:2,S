Right, of course.

That's already in.

I'm sorry, I already explained you that linking the two (files and posix 
timers) is going to create more troubles than it actually solves.
The timerfd code provides the same functionality, with zero intrusion in 
existing code, and basically zero code (once if you remove the usual fd 
creation/cleanup).
The code of adding posix timers support would be *all* the existing one
(that is already a thin wrapper that calls hrtimer.c support - like 
posix timers do), plus adding more crud into the posix timers code, plus 
adding file references handling. If *you* want to do that, I can open you 
a door into the timerfd.
