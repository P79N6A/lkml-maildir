This is actually me breaking up a giant driver into pieces small
enough to post to lkml without hitting the 100 KB limit.
This is just an RFC -- I assume the driver is going to get merged in
the end as one big git changeset with a changelog like "add driver for
IBM eHCA InfiniBand adapters".

Well, the eHCA guys tell me that they can't post patches to lkml.
You're right that the final merge will have to have an IBM
Signed-off-by: line but as I said this is just an RFC.  There are many
reasons beyond patch format issues that make this stuff unmergeable as-is.

This is actually stuff to talk to the firmware that sits below the
kernel on IBM ppc64 machines, not an interface to load device firmware
from userspace.
