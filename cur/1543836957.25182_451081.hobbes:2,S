Well, I guess we'd like VMI to be buildable in normal kernel build
tools ... and at that point, open sourcing it should be _really_ easy.
And we'd prefer legal decisions not to influence technical ones. Maybe
we will decide to use binary interface after all, but seeing GPLed,
easily-buildable interface, first, means we can look at both solutions
and decide which one is better.
