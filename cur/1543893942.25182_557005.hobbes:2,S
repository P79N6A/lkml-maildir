Good argument, but I'll stand by my interpretation of the law, the GPL and the 
situation until there is solid proof that a signing-key is part of the source 
code. Doubly so because the language of the GPLv2 makes it clear that "all 
relevant scripts, etc" are only needed to build and run the "covered work" - 
not for proper installation of it. (and, in the case of a TiVO, the signing 
keys are part of the installation, not the running or building. Besides 
needing the proper signing key, the kernel in a TiVO is run the same as any 
other Linux kernel)

Agreed. However, AFAICT, TiVO meets the provisions of the GPLv2 - they make 
the source of the GPL'd part of their system available. (And I'm not going to 
get into arguments over whether kernel modules are "derivative works" or not, 
since those invariably end up with "They aren't, even though we think they 
should be")

Then explain the patents on the MP3 algorithm, the LZW algorithm, etc... Those 
patents are real and while the LZW one may have lapsed, still relevant.
