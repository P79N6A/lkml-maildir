Technically what they're holding back is _trademark_ rights, which are a 
different area of IP law and not addressed by the GPL.  (I know you know 
this, but just for the record...)
The five main areas of IP law as I understand them are copyright, patent, 
trademark, contract, and trade secret.  Each of which is a different animal 
with a different legal foundation and different enabling legislation.  The 
GPL is a copyright license with some language about patents.  It is not based 
on contract law (although that's a common misperception that Lawrence Lessig 
and Eben Moglen have spent some effort debunking), and doesn't even mention 
trademarks.
So Red Hat isn't saying "you can use some of our copyrights but not others", 
last I heard all of their copyrights are licensed GPLv2 as a matter of 
corporate policy.  What you can't use is their trademarked name or logo, 
because they are explicitly refusing to license the trademarks to third 
parties.
And under GPLv2, this is allowed.
