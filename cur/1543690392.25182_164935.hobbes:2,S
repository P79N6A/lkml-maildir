I definitely support the posting of plain patches, and strongly 
encourage it.  We don't want any barriers at all to people testing the 
latest ACPI fixes.
May I make a humble suggestion?  :)  Whenever net driver stuff gets send 
off, I'll often run a prepared script which will create a GNU diff 
against mainline, gzip it, and upload it to ftp.kernel.org.  That gives 
the non-BK users patches to play with.
I first considered posting these net driver patches on sourceforge 
(project: gkernel), but uploads to sourceforge are time-consuming 
events.  You have a upload to an FTP site, then fill out a bunch of 
forms and click a bunch of buttons.  It's a system that _discourages_ 
frequent software postings, IMO.
So, my suggestion is to get an account on some web/ftp site 
(kernel.org?) and create a script that combines two tasks (bk push and 
GNU patch upload) into a single command you run on your local Linux box. 
  Properly scripted, posting a patch shouldn't be any more work than 
pushing to your new test tree.  And IMHO you will reap the benefits.
