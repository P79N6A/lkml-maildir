No. The changes triggered by CONFIG_CPUSETS_LEGACY_API are:
- /proc/<pid>/cpuset is an alias for /proc/<pid>/containers
- a dummy "cpuset" filesystem exists
- mounting the "cpuset" filesystem causes:
  - the container filesystem to be mounted in its place
  - the release agent to be switched to /sbin/cpuset_release_agent
  - defaults the "cpuset" container type to be enabled
