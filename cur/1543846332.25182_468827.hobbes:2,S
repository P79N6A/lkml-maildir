	I personally never said it was shipping already in all distro.
	Debian Testing has the proper version since last May (forget
about Stable, as usual). So, Debian is in fine shape, I would say...
	Gentoo 2006.1 is obviously shipping with it.
	FC6 has it since August. It's currently in RC.
	I believe Mandriva 2007 has it, and it's also in RC. They make
it hard for non-club member to know what's happening.
	SuSE I can't figure out.
	Slackware has it in the dev version. 10.2 was one year ago, so
they are due for a new release, I guess.
	Note that both rpmseek and rpmfind are obsolete, so it's
actually a pain trying to track down all that info.
