"only" is the wrong word in this context.
If someone would update the translations for one language every
3 months for the next years that would be great and disprove my 
concerns.
After all, updates every 3 months would beat the maintainance level of 
at least three of our architectures...
And don't underestimate the amount of work required - even when talking 
about requiring "only" 10% of the help texts translated that's a four 
digit number of lines to translate.

We don't even manage to maintain the English language texts properly,
and I am therefore not overly optimistic that we'll have the 
translations maintained properly for many years.
OTOH, if someone wouldn't just blindly translate the outdated English 
texts but also review the English texts when translating this alone 
might be worth it...
