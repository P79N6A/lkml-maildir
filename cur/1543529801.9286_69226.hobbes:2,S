I can live with that reasoning :)

I don't know what the issue there is either.  Maybe bash's
behaviour has changed since then.

Hmph.  Dunno.

Unless the processor information is actually important.  I think
we might not want to omit that from the information.
If that's the case we can do a "uname -mp" as well as 
"cat /proc/version"

Oops.  I misread your comment.

I think your patch looks pretty good to me.  Not that I'm
a Certified Kernel Hacker or anything :)  
If there is a need for the processor/machine information from
uname, we can add uname -mp after the cat /proc/version as
I mentioned above.
Of course, if we wanted lots of detail we could cat /proc/cpuinfo :)
