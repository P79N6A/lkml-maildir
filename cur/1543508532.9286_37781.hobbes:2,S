It's the gcc compiler. When it doesn't like '\' it generally means that
there are additional characters (tabs or spaces) after the '\'.
#define PRINT\	
    puts("Hello world!")
main()
{
   PRINT;
}
xxx.c:3: warning: missing white space after `#define PRINT'
xxx.c:4: parse error before string constant
xxx.c: In function `main':
xxx.c:9: stray '\' in program
Just make sure that the '\' is the last character on the line and
it will work just fine.
Cheers,
