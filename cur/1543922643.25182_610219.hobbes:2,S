The EFI variable runtime service is included in this patchset.
The EFI time runtime service is selectable via kernel command line
parameter now. If it is desired, it can be disabled by default, and only
enabled if specified in kernel command line parameter. I think the time
runtime service may be useful if the underlying hardware is changed
silently by some vendor.
