It has some pros and cons.  Having indentation makes things easier on
human eyes but more difficult on scripts, but not too difficult -
indented lines can easily be matched with a bit of scripting.  Changing
the behavior is easy but I'm still inclined toward indentation because
printing header every line loses information about message boundaries.
Maybe there's a way to satisfy both like omitting the separator from the
second line on.
ata1.00: line0
ata1.00  line1
ata1.00  line2
Hmm... Any better ideas?
