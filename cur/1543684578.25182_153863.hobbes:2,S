hmm, since ages I use for 2.4.x a small patch, which
includes the .config in the kernel image (gzipped or 
bzip2ed). this information can be retrieved from the
procfs by zcat /proc/config.gz or bzcat /proc/config.bz2
respectively ...
you can get the patch for recent 2.4.x kernels from
my pages 
http://www.13thfloor.at/VServer/Patches.shtml
(they are 03_kconfig* in the patchsets)
for example for 2.4.22-pre10, this would be ...
