We thought we had solved this by having our internal DNS 'ask'
the DHCP servers what their dynamic addresses were. Unfortunately
M$ idea about port 53 is entirely different than the rest of the
world. The returned information is garbage and not compatible with
even the latest named/bind.
I had to set up a separate 'net', using a M$ DNS (two of them). That
way, at least my DNS would slave the defective information so the
M$ machines could use it even though Unix machines could not. 
zone "analogic.net" in {
    type slave;
    masters {
        10.98.2.1;
        10.100.2.2;
        };
    allow-query { any; };
    allow-transfer { any; };
};
You can see the problem if you just do:
# nslookup
lserver m$.garbage.server
set type = ANY
domain.name
Well.... at least M$ communicates on port 53. I guess that proves
it's ready to ship.
