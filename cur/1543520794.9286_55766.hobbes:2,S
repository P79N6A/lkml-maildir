Many of the stack-smashing exploits I've seen pad the exploit
code with a large number of no-op instructions; the return then
has to point only somewhere into the no-op padding rather than
directly at the useful part of the exploit code.  Making a
successful exploit in those cases takes less detailed knowledge
and a lot fewer attempts before finding a return address that
works, and it works in many more cases since the frame that gets
smashed can be located over a much larger range of addresses.
