  I'm out of town so I miss a bit of this, but I agree, what you want time
waiting for IO, total.
  That said, it would probably be useful to keep the first patch
information, since overall disk performance reflects in total IOwait,
while wait VM is useful comparing the several flavors of vm tuning and
enhancement, bot the the implementors and the users, who may have unusual
configurations.
  I hope that write blocks are falling into place as well, because even
though they are less common, you still get programs which build ugly stuff
like a full 700MB CD image in memory and do that last write (or close, or
fsync, etc). This is bad with large memory, and unspeakable with small,
where stuff is being paged in and writen out.
