I am not sure it it is HID-specific problem or a wider one but it looks
like usbhid can be unloaded while there are references to objects produced
by this module - hence refcounting problem. You either have to disallow
unloading while there are references (but this path leads to potential
deadlocks) or have a generic release function registered with the core that
pretty much always stays there. Then you can free all device-specific data
at unload time and mark the object as a zombie so anything that tries to
touch it releases it quickly and then the core routine will free skeleton
data at last.
The patch that I sent should hide the problem somewhat as at disconnect
time it will unregister corresponsing class devices thus dropping the
reference that was pinning usbhid structures.
