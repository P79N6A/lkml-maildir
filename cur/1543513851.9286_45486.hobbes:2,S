Hm, i had the same problems with a setup i installed at work (i'm at
home now, so i can't post more details). The problem we had was that
someone silently bought 100MBit hubs but didnt exchange the 10MBit
switch above all hubs. So this led not only into a communication
problem within the company but also between to machines doing udp.
All machines attached to 100MBit hubs happily blast out lots of
packages and unfortunately the udp-receiver was not under the same
hub. I dont know what happens inside udp/ip on linux but is it
possible that this bloody setup (i know its silly) leads to
timingproblems inside the linux-nfsd?
