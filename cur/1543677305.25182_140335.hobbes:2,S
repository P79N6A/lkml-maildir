I was thinking about this and decided to check it out.  It's actually
not true any more.  binfmt_misc was converted (back in 2.4) to be its
own filesystem.  If binfmt_misc is compiled in or as a module (?!),
procfs creates somewhere for you to mount it (/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc)
but there's no need to mount it there.
I note that if you have CONFIG_SYSCTL=n, it will actually silently fail
to create this directory.
#ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL
        proc_sys_root = proc_mkdir("sys", 0);
#endif
#if defined(CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC) || defined(CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC_MODULE)
        proc_mkdir("sys/fs", 0);
        proc_mkdir("sys/fs/binfmt_misc", 0);
#endif
So I guess I'll remove the bit from the helptext about procfs
and substitute some better words instead.  Maybe I'll update
Documentation/binfmt_misc too.
