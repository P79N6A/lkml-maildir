Another way to deal with that is to use remap-log...  See
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/remapper.git/
for current version; it's _very_ good at reducing noise in diffs
from line renumbering, leaving the real changes.  While the number
of bogus warnings is very high, indeed, the rate at which they
appear is not _that_ horrible...
