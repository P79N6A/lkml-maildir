what about the follwing patch in fs/proc/generic.c, this would solve the problem
for any driver wanting to
create multiple entries using create_proc_entry:
*** generic.c.orig      Mon Oct 16 01:49:23 2000
--- generic.c   Mon Oct 16 02:17:09 2000
***************
*** 505,510 ****
--- 505,515 ----
        if (!parent && xlate_proc_name(name, &parent, &fn) != 0)
                goto out;
        len = strlen(fn);
+          /* check that entry doesn't already exist,
+             and return it if it's the case */
+         for( ent = parent->subdir; ent; ent = ent->next )
+            if( proc_match(len, fn, ent) ) return ent;
+
        ent = kmalloc(sizeof(struct proc_dir_entry) + len + 1, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!ent)
This one have a big drawback: mode doesn't affect the returned entry. Anyway
if someone create a /proc entry, it may always have the same type. We could
also define a clear behaviour for such cases.
Same kind of patch could apply in proc_symlink, proc_mknod and proc_mkdir.
