Applied, thanks Dave.
Please post bluetooth patches, just like any other networking patches,
to netdev@vger.kernel.org (CC:'ing me) so that other networking
developers can process them during times like these when most
maintainers aren't around and thus not looking at bug fixes like
your's.
Thanks.
