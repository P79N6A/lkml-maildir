Have you tried (or even looked at) Mercurial?  I'm now using it for four
different projects that used to be in CVS and I'm loving it.

Likewise for Mercurial, except that IMHO, a from-scratch Mercurial  
pull via
HTTP + Mercurial checkout is faster than a BK or GIT checkout alone.   
And
then there's the fact that it stores the whole mess in a fraction of the
space used by git.
Please, just _try_ it first.  You'll like it, I promise.  (It's also a
much smaller codebase too)
Cheers,
