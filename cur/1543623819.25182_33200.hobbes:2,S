I am playing around in the VFS code (fs/namei.c), and was wondering what
is the most efficient way of finding a child subdir if I already have
the mountpoint?  Currently I am doing somethine like:
        <... from_nd initialization ...>
	to = kmalloc(PATH_MAX,GFP_KERNEL);
        if (to == NULL)
                goto rel_fnd;
        to[0] = '\0'; 
        /* build the to pathname */
        strcat (to, from_nd.dentry->d_sb->s_root->d_name.name);
        strcat (to, "/dir_to_find/");
        /* check if the directory exists */
        if (path_init(to, LOOKUP_POSITIVE, &to_nd))
                error = path_walk(to, &to_nd);
	if(!error)
		...
This seems totally inefficient to me, but I can't seem to find a better
method.  I do not want to go into the fs code (eg ext2, etc) for a
faster way-- I need to stay up high in VFS.
Thanks!
