I compared the performance of LT epoll using libevent against other
event mechanisms: select, poll and kqueue.
You can find the results at
  
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
As kqueue and epoll are not available on the same operating system,
you have to take the results qualitatively.  However, kqueue and epoll
are in the same ballpark.  Both outperform select and poll.
It seems that option 3) which implements both "edge" and "level"
triggered behavior is the best solution.  This is similar to kqueue
which supports both triggering modes.
