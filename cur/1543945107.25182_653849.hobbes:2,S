Very strange.  I threw in an output line counter into the printk code() ... if I
disable the timestamps for the first 30 lines, then everything is good (so the
basic timestamping code does still work on ia64). But I would have thought
that Ingo's delay until sched_init() ought to be long enough too. Clearly I
need to figure out exactly what needs to be initialized to prevent the
hang/crash.
