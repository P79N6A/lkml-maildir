Meaning we will finally have CD-tracks visualized as WAV files? like CD-fs 
does? Same goes for multisession disks.

How is this on performance (first check for fs type than loading module? 
than disk is removed, unloading module and loading another one?)

I am only planning to do this for the 2.5.x and later kernels, so if anyone else wishes to back-port it to an older kerenl series, by all means do so. I have wanted to make some kind of contribution to this project for some time and I feel that this is something that will be useful.

had a proof of concept of something like this on some ftp server (sorry,
