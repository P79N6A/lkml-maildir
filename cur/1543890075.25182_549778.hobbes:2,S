There are quite a few of these fixes where you look at it and wonder "ytf
did the kernel ever work"?  I suspect that it's partly a case of the code
reading random junk from where a flag used to be and continuing to work.
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC would have caught it.
Also, simply lack of testing coverage: few people have the correct
hardware, the correct config options and then go and do an rmmod+insmod. 
Even fewer do a CPU hotplug.  Fewer still do a memory hotplug.
But there are a lot of fixes, and a lot of warnings, and they are real bugs.

Sometimes.  But a common pattern is "discover something at boot time and
save it away for later boot-time code".  The storage gets marked __fooinit
and then it turns out that some non-boot-time initialisation code is using
it.

That would be a false positive.  We do need the various tools to suppress
those so that we can find new bugs as they turn up.
You're right that it's all a complete pain.  But the fault doesn't lie with
the checking code, IMO.  It's just that the whole initdata thing is hard to
get right.  All this fuss for a couple hundred kbytes - any sane
organisation would have killed the whole thing years ago ;)
It'll really get to be fun when some smarty writes us a "non __init symbol
referred to only from __init code" checker.
