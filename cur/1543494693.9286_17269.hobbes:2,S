         ^^^^________  logical test of an assignment? This will always
                       be true!
  if((pid = fork()) != 0) or
  if((pid = fork())) 
                       You need to make the assignment first, then
                       test for non-zero.

No, also if you want a defined order in which stuff is printed either
do fprintf(stderr, "whatever"); or printf("whatever"); fflush(stdout);
Standard output is buffered.
This works fine, and in the correct order.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <wait.h>
int main(void);
int main()
{
    pid_t pid;
    int status;
    switch((pid = fork()))
    {
    case 0:     /* Child */
        fprintf(stderr,"Child (%ld)\n", getpid());
        exit(123);
    case -1:
        fprintf(stderr, "Error with fork()\n");
        exit(2);
    default:    /* Parent */
        fprintf(stderr, "Parent waits for child (%ld) status\n", pid);
        wait(&status);
        fprintf(stderr, "Child's exit status was %d\n", status >> 8);
     }
    return 0;
}
