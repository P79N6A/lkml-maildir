Where it's cheap for me in terms of testig I'm already trying to put the
changes in place where they are needed. Basically the only thing I didn't
care about are the amiga specific parts.... (Fortunately I have a RAID
DACxxx at hand to test this part out.) Even if I don't get it right there
one can at least look at the patch and will see where changes will be needed.

Basically what I see from the code yes. On the low level part the
difference line is much exactly like what I have already explained
in a preivous message about fundamental UNIX device handling design:
block devices are mass storage and char devices are for all the other
garbage around there which can be attached to a computer.

Hey! nice to see that Linus is basically seeing from the code what I'm just too
lazy to explain in full length with my inferior english ;-).
