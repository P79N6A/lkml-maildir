It's a mechanism to implement nested subprograms which have to reference
the stack frame of the enclosing subprogram.  From an abstract point of
view, some kind of currying is required to get rid of the stack frame
pointer of the calling routine.  This is implemented by creating a
trampoline on the stack which pushes the address of the stack frame and
calls the nested subprogram after that.  When you request a pointer to
the nested subprogram, the compiler uses the address of the template
instead, effecitvely hiding the additional parameter containing the
stack frame pointer.  (Of course, you can do other funny things with
templates, not just nested subprograms.)
For clarification, consider the following code:
void caller(void (*trampoline)())
{
	trampoline();
}
void main()
{
	int i;
	void nested()
	{
	}
	caller(nested);
}
It compiles to:
caller:
	subl $12,%esp
	movl 16(%esp),%eax
	call *%eax
	addl $12,%esp
	ret
(This is an ordinary indirect function call.)
nested.78:
	subl $28,%esp
	movl %ecx,12(%esp)
	addl $28,%esp
	ret
(Note that this code loads the parent frame pointer.)
main:
	subl $28,%esp
	movl %esp,%eax
	movl $nested.78-10,%edx
	movb $185,(%eax)
	leal 16(%esp),%ecx
	movl %ecx,1(%eax)
	movb $233,5(%eax)
	subl %eax,%edx
	movl %edx,6(%eax)
(This writes the trampoline code code on the stack.)
	addl $-12,%esp
	leal 12(%esp),%eax
	pushl %eax
	call caller
	addl $16,%esp
	addl $28,%esp
	ret
(Finally, `caller' is called, and the address of the trampoline on the
stack is passed to it.)
There are other options for implementing nested subprograms (at least,
Ada was specifically designed to permit them), but I never understood
them, and they seem to be a PITA to implement.
