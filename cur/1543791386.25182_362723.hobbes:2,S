Earlier this week, my calls to register_filesystem(struct 
file_system_type * fs) were failing returning an -EBUSY. Now I didn't 
know if it was failing because of:
	if (fs->next)	return -EBUSY;
Or:
	p = find_filesystem(fs->name);
         if (*p)	res = -EBUSY;
	...
	return res;
It is for this reason I thought it would make sense to differentiate 
between the two points of failure.
