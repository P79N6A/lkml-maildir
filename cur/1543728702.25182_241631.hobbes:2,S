Jens,
Did you mean cdrwtool or cdmrw?
I've done a format with cdrwtool (cdrwtool -t 10 -d /dev/hdc -q) but when I 
try and mount it (mount -o rw,noatime -t udf /dev/hdc /cdmrw) and mount gives 
the message:
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
dmesg shows no error after cdrwtool has run but has the following new messages 
after the media is mounted:
cdrom: hdc: mrw address space DMA selected
cdrom open: mrw_status 'not mrw'
UDF-fs INFO UDF 0.9.8.1 (2004/29/09) Mounting volume 'LinuxUDF', timestamp 
2004/08/13 12:35 (1000)
The media does, however, mount OK for packet writing (sudo mount -t udf -o 
rw,noatime /dev/pktcdvd/cdrw /cdrw) using another kernel patched with the 
packet writing patches Peter Osterlund has submitted for the -mm series.
I'll try a full (as opposed to quick) blank with cdrwtool plus a forced format 
with cdmrw and report back when that has finished.
