Subject: Permedia 2 Framebuffer broke?

I recently made the jump from 2.2.12 to 2.3.26 and ran into a problem
with Permedia 2 Framebuffer . It compiles fine but I get the following
error on boot up stating:
pm2fb: cannot reserve fb memory, abort
I have a STB GlyderMAX-2  8 meg AGP card (Permedia 2 Chipset).
It worked great with 2.2.12 . God I love that 1024x768 console!
Can anyone else confirm that its broke or not?
