I would add:
6) change strcpy to string_copy so gcc doesn't think it knows what the
   function does
7) code RELOC etc. in assembly, which would let us get rid of the
	offset = reloc_offset();
   at the beginning of each function which uses RELOC.
Maybe 7 is the way to go, at least it will shut the bush-lawyers up.
