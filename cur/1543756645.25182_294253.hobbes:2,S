Yes, but...
get_user_pages broke COW in advance of the I/O.  The reason for
subsequent COW if the page gets unmapped is precisely because
can_share_swap_page used page_count to judge exclusivity, and
get_user_pages has bumped that up, so the page appears (in danger
of being) non-exclusive when actually it is exclusive.  By changing
can_share_swap_page to use page_mapcount, that frustration vanishes.
(Of course, if the process forks while async I/O is in progress,
these I/O pages could still get COWed, and either parent or child
lose some of the data being read - but behaviour in that case is
anyway undefined, isn't it?  Just so long as kernel doesn't crash.)

The page_mapcount+page_swapcount test for exclusivity is simply a
better test for exclusivity than the page_count test.  Since it says
exclusive when the page is exclusive, no COW occurs (and I've just
remembered that we're actually talking of the odd case where the
process itself writes into another portion of the page under I/O,
to get that write fault: but that still works).
page_count does still play a vital role, in ensuring that the page
stays held in the swapcache, cannot actually be reused for something
else while it's unmapped.

I did ask Toshihiro about that earlier in the thread.  Best look up his
actual reply, but as I understand it, his test is sufficiently thorough
that it's actually doing direct I/Os in parallel, so there's never a
moment when the page is free.  He believes that an unprivileged process
should not be allowed to hold pages indefinitely unmigratable.
I have little appreciation of the hotplug/memmigration issues here.
But whatever the merits of that, I do think the new can_share_swap_page
is an improvement over the old (written in the days before page_mapcount
existed), and that it's preferable to remove the page_count heuristic
from try_to_unmap_one.
