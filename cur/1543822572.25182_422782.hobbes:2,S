I'm not very sure but it might be historical.  ahci got implemented 
after ata_piix and in the meantime ata_piix must have handled all it 
could.  Can you verify whether modifying the code to return -ENODEV work 
for your machine?  If so, that could be the correct solution but I'm a 
bit worried because it could change probing order or fail to enable 
devices it used to.  Maybe we need a hack to return -ENODEV iff ahci is 
there to handle the device.
