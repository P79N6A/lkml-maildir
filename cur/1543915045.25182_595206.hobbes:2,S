I agree, this is probably somehow related with SiS chipset - my laptop
has one of these SiS 760 host controllers inside. 
I'll probably do some digging to figure out if this is indeed chipset
related. I wonder if this error occurs under Windows (Win does not
report much, yet it's kernel must be aware of such error).
