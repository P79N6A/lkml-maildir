That is clearly bejond the scope of the kernel or hotplug. This policy
belongs to some other device management software. We are currently working on
HAL as one example, to make that happen.

Forget about the kernel device names, these are "cookies" to access the
device and have no other meaning. Never rely on that longer as your
device session lasts! You may use a udev rule to create a stable name for
your device based on some unique device property and that will work.
Btw: With HAL we even don't care about the /dev-name, all volumes are
recognized by uuid or fslabel.

Yes, we need to make the unplug of mounted devices more safe, especially
with sync mount, but don't expect the kernel or hotplug to do anything
like that. It's up to some policy software higher in the stack.
Thanks,
