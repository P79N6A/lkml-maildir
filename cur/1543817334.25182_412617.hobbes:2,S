What I did in one experiment was to:
     1.  delay swapin requests if the process was over its rsslimit,
         until it fell below, and
     2.  Poke the swapper to try to swap out the current process's
         pages in that case.
The problem with the approach is that it behaved poorly under memory
pressure.  If a process's optimum working set was larger than its RSS
limit, then either it was delayed to the point of glaciality, or it
could saturate the swap device (and so disturb other processes's
operation).
