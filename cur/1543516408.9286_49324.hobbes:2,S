If I don't have these, I get the following kernel msg:
early initialization of device cpc1 is deferred
early initialization of device cpc2 is deferred

I already have a function called cpc_init ... :)
Anyhow, let's focus on the problem for now. I can change the names later,
if necessary.

Even in this case, it would be better to have a pointer in ppp_device
instead of the structure itself. Imagine the case where the driver
supports several different protocols (which actually is the case of my
driver -- it supports X.25 as well as PPP/Cisco HDLC). In this case, I
would have to declare the ppp_device structure anyway just to use the
struct device inside it, and this doesn't sound right to me. Do you
agree??
Question: could you please tell me how I should implement this thing so
that I don't get the aforementioned msg ("early initialization ..."),
besides having the first device functional??

Ivan
