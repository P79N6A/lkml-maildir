Hi all,
I have written a patch for the autofs4 kernel module (and autofs
4.0.0-pre10 daemon) to deal with ghosting of directories (and to a
limited degree, direct automount maps). Refer to
http://www.themaw.net/includehtml.php?sendit=ians_html/autofs.html
 for
more information if you wish.
There have been a few changes to the autofs4 module in kernel release
2.4.20 that break this patch. I have looked through the Changelog for
2.4.20 and 2.4.19 and don't see any reference to the changes. I have
also had a brief look through the archives of this list without success.
A first look indicates that the problem for me has been caused by the
removal of the file_operations definition autofs4_dir_operations in
root.c. Then the dcache default file_operations are used for inode
initialization in inode.c instead. My initial impression is that if
there is a specific reason for using the dcache default then I will need
to work on an autofs4 implementation of dcache_dir_lseek. The rest may
be OK.
To save me some time and possible pain I am hoping to find out the
reasoning behind this change from the implementor. Please copy any reply
to my personal email address as I am not subscribed to this list. I
think that the autofs list is closed to people who are not subscribed so
I will forward any replies that don't make it there.
Should notification of these changes be posted to the autofs list?
