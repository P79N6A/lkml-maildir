Thanks, I'll include these in the next -mm kernel.
Reading the code, the only thing which leaps out is:
+/* Use our own asm for 64 bit multiply/divide */
+#define ASM_MUL64_REG(eax_out,edx_out,reg_in,eax_in) 			\
+		__asm__ __volatile__("mull %2" 				\
+				:"=a" (eax_out), "=d" (edx_out) 	\
+				:"r" (reg_in), "0" (eax_in))
+
+#define ASM_DIV64_REG(eax_out,edx_out,reg_in,eax_in,edx_in) 		\
+		__asm__ __volatile__("divl %2" 				\
+				:"=a" (eax_out), "=d" (edx_out) 	\
+				:"r" (reg_in), "0" (eax_in), "1" (edx_in))
We seem to keep on proliferating home-grown x86 64-bit math functions.
Do you really need these?  Is it possible to use do_div() and the C 64x64
`*' operator instead?
I'd like the rtc emulation patch to be redone to remove the ifdefs please,
they're a real eyesore.
At the top of rtc.c, do something like this:
#ifndef CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC
#define is_hpet_enabled() 0
#define hpet_set_alarm_time(hrs, min, sec) 0
#define hpet_set_periodic_freq(arg) 0
static inline int hpet_mask_rtc_irq_bit(int arg) { return 0; }
#define hpet_rtc_timer_init() do { } while (0)
#define hpet_rtc_dropped_irq() 0
#endif
And then all those eleven ifdefs can be removed from rtc.c.
Thanks.
