Ahh. You're using the BIOS to re-initialize your video, aren't you? 
If STR works without X, then you have something else resuming graphics, 
and that may be what then interacts badly with the fact that the kernel 
also does so.

Let's try to narrow it down to what the interaction is. Are you using 
something like acpi_sleep=s3_bios or similar? That's what the kernel 
support is supposed to make unnecessary in the long run, along with all 
the video mode flickering (ie we should be able to resume to the video 
mode we want, not flicker through unnecessary modes).
