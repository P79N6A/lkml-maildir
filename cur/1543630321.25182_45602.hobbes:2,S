Ok, if you want your fs back, correct way is to download latest preversion of
reiserfsprogs (reiserfsprogs-3.x.1c-pre4 for now) from namesys.com ftp site,
build it somewhere, boot off rescue media of some kind, and then run
reiserfsck with --rebuild-tree argument (and a path to your partition of
course). If you cannot build any binaries anywhere, I can send you a binary
of reiserfsck.
You problem is that pointer to data block got corrupted and now points
outside of the partition.
(notw, if you have some reiserfsck version on your rescue media, it won't
help you, because this exact problem got fixed only recently)
Bye,
    Oleg
