They don't care *now*.  They will care when they try to rev forward from .19.
Not that they'll care a *lot* - it took *me* all of about an hour to get VMware
Server 1.0.4 working under -rc3-mm2.  Probably will take an enterprise distro
4-5 hours, 30 mins for the port and 4 1/2 hours for the paperwork. :)
