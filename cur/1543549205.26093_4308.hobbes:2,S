Hello.
I am trying to mmap a frame buffer device (which I wrote) and it
doesn't seem to work.  I verified the address - it appears OK.
However, whatever I write out to the address from my userland program,
the bits appear to go into the bit bucket.
I am trying to figure out remap_page_range; what is the value of
pgprot_t supposed to be?  It appears to be set to:
_PAGE_PRESENT | _PAGE_READ | _PAGE_WRITE | _CACHE_UNCACHED
(printed value, 0x407).
Any idea why this wouldn't work?  I am not too familiar with MIPS
so I don't know what a reasonable value should be for pgprot_t.
Thanks,
Mark
