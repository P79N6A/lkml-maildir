	   Unreproductible here, with Slackware 7.0, gcc-2.95.2,
   kernel compiled with maquerading and firewalling, I think that you
   should repost the compiler version and options config file.
Hit reload several times on one of the README type files, you'll
get it, even with 2.3.x, see my other posting.
Later,
