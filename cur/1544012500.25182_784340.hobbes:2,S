(it would be useful to embedd the full patch in such cases in the email - 
makes for a quicker review)

no objections from the x86 perspective, as long as it does not break 
stuff. If it breaks stuff it's all your fault ;-) I checked these commits:
 218a372: x86: override_capabilities in early_identify_cpu
 5144b68: x86: prepare noexec for being called earlier
 5689919: x86: clean up setup_clear/force_cpu_cap handling
 b41144e: x86: act on mem= and memmap= later in boot
and they definitely look like a step forward.
One detail: please send a pull request to Linus after the pending x86 tree 
went upstream, so that there are no conflicts with existing x86 items. 
There will be a (trivial) context-overlap conflict in 
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c.
