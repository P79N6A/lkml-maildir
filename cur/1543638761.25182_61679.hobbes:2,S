I don't think so - the list walks in there are fairly long.
What seems to be happening is that, as Daniel mentioned,
all the pte_chains for page N happen to have good locality
with the pte_chains for page N+1.  Like parallel lines.
That might not hold up for longer-lived processes, slab cache
fragmentation, longer chains, etc...
