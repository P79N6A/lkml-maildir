As I mentioned above: A function that allows an allocation to specify 
which physical memory ranges are permitted.

We can still reduce the number of zones for those that require highmem to 
two which may allows us to avoid ZONE_DMA/DMA32 issues  and allow dma 
devices to avoid bunce buffers that can do I/O to memory ranges not 
compatible with the current boundaries of DMA/DMA32. And I am also 
repeating myself.
