# Noticed by Julie DeWandel <jdewand@redhat.com>.
# 
# do_fork() needs to return the pid (or error), not the pointer to the
# resulting process structure.  The process structure may not even be
# valid any more, since do_fork() has already woken the process up (and as
# a result it might already have done its thing and gone away).
# 
# Besides, doing it this way cleans up the users, which all really just
# wanted the pid or error number _anyway_.
Just FYI: the change was done in the first place to allow spawning a
new init thread as CPUs come up.  But now we have copy_process it can
be done neatly (it should also be done out of keventd so we get a
clean thread, but that's another story).
Note that this version also has a (theoretical) race, except hidden
by the time to wrap PIDs ie. "never happens".
Thanks!
Rusty.
