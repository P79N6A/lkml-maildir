Hello, I fixed and tested a small bug in lib/sort.c file, heap sort
function.
The fix avoids unnecessary swap of contents when i is 0 (saves few loads and
stores),
which happens every time sort function is called. I felt the fix is worth
bringing it 
to your attention given the importance and frequent use of the sort
function.
Thank you all.
