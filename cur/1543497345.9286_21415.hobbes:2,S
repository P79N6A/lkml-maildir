Yes: if you remove the test, accessing the hardware still doesn't work!

This line only works for pages where MAP_NR(page) < MAP_NR(high_memory).
To access other hardware addresses from kernel space requires a call
to ioremap() first.
Well ok, _some_ addresses will still work if the phase of your moon is
right, but not reliably.
However I don't know why the test isn't simply `page < high_memory'.
