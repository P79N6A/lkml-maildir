Are you sure?  Suppose a pcmcia disk drive is plugged in to that socket.  
Why is a disk driver going to name its object "pcmcia_socket0"?  It must
be the pcmcia socket driver that owns the object, not the disk driver.  So 
then where does the disk driver put the disk-related attributes?  Don't 
say in /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket0/device/, because the driver 
doesn't own that object either.
Anyway, in my case it's a USB device.  At the moment /sys/class/usb
doesn't contain anything AFAICT, although no doubt that can be changed.
Greg, what is the current organization of directories for USB buses and 
devices?  Would it make sense to let each driver register its devices as
/sys/class/usb/bus#/dev#/ ?  Would that better be done under /sys/bus/usb 
?  Or is something else already there?  Or should the usb-storage driver, 
for example, create its own class?
