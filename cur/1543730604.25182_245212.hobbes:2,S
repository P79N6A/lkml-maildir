I have one of those philips cams (bought it because I saw pwc in the 
kernel source), but I found out that without pwcx is was next to 
useless. I haven't found a good alternative camera though...
The fact that the NDA has expired already doesn't surprise me, but I 
would have expected some (or a huge) effort to liberate the source with 
full permission from Philips (they probably don't care anymore and could 
use the (marginal) good publicity more that the secret).
The fact that this hasn't happened is to me a hint that Nemosoft likes 
the power of "owning" it more that the chance of liberating it. But I 
could be wrong in that... (I apologise in advance if I'm wrong!)
I'd prefer that a clear choice is made on this, as Nemosoft suggests, 
because it shouldn't be in the kernel without the full decoding algorithms.
