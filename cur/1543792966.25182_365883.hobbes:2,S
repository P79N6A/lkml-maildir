When you try to load the module, you will get the error again, right in
your kernel/system log, which explicitly shows that you had a problem.

Don't try to do things to fix your prior problems in your patch, with
changes today so that you don't do it again in the future :)
The build process properly notifies the builder of the problem, if they
ignore it, there's really nothing more we can do about it, right?
