After having written a generic standalone solution (currently in testing)
with less code than the evms plugin, I have my doubts about EVMS allowing
minimal solutions. It seems most of your plugin is just code to make EVMS
happy and I was frightened by that.

Please do not misunderstand my intentions. I appreciate your code very
much and tried to reuse as much of it as possible (and tried to keep my
modifications small), and if you plan on integrating my generic code into
EVMS you're most welcome (I would feel honoured).
However, my goals were (in that order):
1. Spit out a list of devices that have some sort of RAID magic
2. Group the devices by array
3. Set up a device corresponding to /dev/araraid/d0
and keep the code generic and independent enough so that it can be
integrated into EVMS or used standalone with only a few changes.
Code will follow once I get step 3 working generically.
Step 1 is done (I have some trouble finding the superblock on small
PDCRAID arrays, will ask Jeff).
Step 2 is done (modulo implementation bugs not yet found)
Step 3 is partly done (It only works for striped Highpoint arrays because
I didn't have the hardware available until now)
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
