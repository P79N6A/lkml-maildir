Valid enough for sure. :-)
The reason I asked the question was because they seemed to talk like
they've never heard of journaling. I was curious if there was a reason
they made such a topic out of it. Well, all the answers made clear to me
that fsck still is necessary, and some have other reasons like software
raid or "was not available by then" and so on. I'm satisfied and
educated now. :-)  (thanx all). I only like to know if a fsck can also
be done if a fs is online (only ro I assume), but someone else asked
that already.
