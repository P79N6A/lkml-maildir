Yes, it is closest to the truth to believe there is one acceleration engine 
that does all drawing, and this should ideally have a single owner.
But that doesn't mean that mode-setting, etc, has to be moved into the DRM - 
for my money that stuff can stay where it is, provided there are some sensible 
interfaces put in place between the two components.
