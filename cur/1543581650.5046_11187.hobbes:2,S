Hello!

Also, you want to increase memory allowed for TCP
echo "X/2 X/2 X" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem
where X is memory in pages.
20480 is a crazy number. Valid applications cannot leave
so much of orphans. Do you understand that this is more than
80MB of wasted memory?

Bad idea. Default value is the lowest possible.

Bad idea.

Absolutely harmless. This is debugging message.
