IMHO open-source drivers are one of the biggest advantages of Linux.
Linuxant seems to be using double standards: we are all for open-source OS but
_our_ drivers have to remain proprietary (I don't care about reasons here).
Marc, I _appreciate_ all your hard-work on open-source projects and I can
understand reasons why Linuxant makes it's drivers but please, be honest. :)
I think that you agree that things like HSF drivers or DriverLoader
(because they are workarounds not the real solution) _may_ slow down creation
of real open-source drivers.
I also hope that this '\0' issue won't scare you from working with
community in the future.
Regards,
Bartlomiej
