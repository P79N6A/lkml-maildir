fs is now ext3

Or almost anything that writes something to the disk.

 Tried converting to ext3, some problem, albeit the lockups are less
severe. More of the locked processes can be killed and echo > test.txt
works. So _some_ io gets through.
 The output from sysrq-T is somewhat less confusing though, it appears
then hung processes is somehow being hung in __generic_unplug_device,  i
had a look at the assembler, but couldn't make heads or tails of it. the
code at __generic_unplug_device+19 was test %eax,%eax immediately
preceded by a callq to the test instruction. Obviously something magic
(by my eyes) is going on here.
 Also tried 2.6.12_rc3-mm3
 I'd really like to find a solution to this since it kinda borks the
nice an shiny machine if it can't handle large files without getting
into trouble.
 I've been working on this for two days, have been trying to find
similar bug reports, trying a lot of different kernels and kernel
options to no avail.
 I'm a little out of options right now, any ideas for something to try,
patches to test, or some help in understanding what's happening ?
