For block devices, it is easy --- I've already done it (it was part of
a previous raw IO patch which never made it into the mainstream).  For
regular files, it will be part of the 2.5 kiobuf infrastructure: I've
already been talking with Ingo about how to do it so that it plays
cleanly with the page cache.
