with DRI you have the case where "something" needs to do security
validation of the commands that are sent to the card. (to avoid a
non-privileged user to DMA all over your memory)
That and a tiny bit of resource management is the bulk of the kernel DRM
code... and I don't think userspace can do it fundamentally better.
Sure you could pipe things to a root daemon instead of doing a system
call. But I don't see that being superior.
