the problem was caused by a mismerge of the __raise_softirq_irqoff() 
changes of preempt-softirqs. In PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS, softirq activation 
means a wakeup of the softirq thread - hence __raise_softirq_irqoff() 
must wake up the softirq thead too. This didnt happen in -rt1 so the 
network softirq (which processes things like ping reply packets) got 
delayed to the natural softirq event - the next timer interrupt in the 
usual case. Hence depending on HZ you got a delay of 1-4-10 msecs 
(divided into two parts).
