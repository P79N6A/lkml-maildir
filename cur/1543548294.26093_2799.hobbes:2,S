Finally got all this done (been a bit busy moving etc).  I was able to
generate APIC errors while running the Seti@Home client at 1.90, 1.95, 2.00,
2.05 and 2.10 Volts.  Cover was off for all tests.  It seemed like APIC
errors were less common at the higher voltages, but I didn't bother to make
any records to compare etc.
Setup is:
400MHz CPUs, 66MHz bus rate, Default AGPCLK (I assume 2/3), QQ Beta BIOS
Power supply is a PC Power & Cooling turbo cool 300, I have another fan in the
front of the box and a 486 fan over the BX chipset.
Other peripherals:
1 Toshiba SCSI DVD drive
3 x IBM UW SCSI hard drives
Matrox G400 AGP
Diamond Dual Fireport 40 (Symbios 876 chip)
Creative Ensoniq Soundscape
3C905A Ethernet
ISA modem
It's not really a big deal to me since I'm getting rid of the BP6 in 2 or 3
weeks, but it's definitely my last ABIT product.
