Hello. I've just upgraded to 2.6.0 from 2.6.0-test6. When I boot my 
system, modules that used to load automatically like those for my 
soundcard,bttv, and serial ports(aka /dev/ttyS*) are no longer loading. 
I've gone as far as upgrading to module-init-tools-0.9.15-pre4 but 
nothing makes these modules load automatically anymore. Any ideas?
