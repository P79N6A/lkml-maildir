Well, the thing is, I obviously _don't_ observe that problem. Neither
does anybody else I have heard about. I get a nice 20MB/s on my IDE
disks both at home and at work, whether reading or writing. 
Which was why I was suspecting the hpt366 code. But considering that
others report good performance with the same controller, it might be
something even more localized, either in just Zlatko's setup (ie disk or
controller breakage), or some subtle timing issue that is general but
you have to have just the right timing to hit it.
