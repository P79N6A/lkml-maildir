but isn't the real question - should the copy even take case? i have no
doubt that if a copy occurs, some cheap computation (ie. a cksum can
easily be hidden in the data transfer through the CPU).
but, why should the copy even occur? there is easily enough research
lingering around these days to show the zero copying is good (Unet for
instance as well as ExoKernel) these were direct access to user space
without copies, but the same philosophy can hold for kernel space.
