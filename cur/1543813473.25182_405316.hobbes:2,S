You couldn't just busy-wait.  You would need to have some wait_queue
to wait on, and someone to wake it up.

Again, you need to be more predictable than just calling schedule().

I'd really like to understand why the code was the way it is before
making that sort of change.  It could just be that there was nothing
obvious to wait on, so maybe just adding a suitable wait_queue would
do it...
But then the current patch essentially adds a wait_queue and waits on
it where appropriate.  So would you approach be that much cleaner?
Maybe...
