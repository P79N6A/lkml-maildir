The boot_delay switch seems to be behaving strangely in the
current -git.  Setting it to =10 makes the output 'bursty'
it becomes slow for some printk's whilst others scroll by
at regular speed.
Setting it any higher than that seems to make it pause for
a really long time before it outputs any text at all.
x86 timer changes perhaps ?
