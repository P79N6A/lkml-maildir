There is a difference between our changes. 
When the system is lightly loaded, my patch minimizes the number of 
groups picking up that load. This will help in power savings for 
example in the context of CMP. There are more changes required
(user or kernel) for complete power savings, but this is a direction 
towards that.
How about this patch?

Don't pull tasks from a group if that would cause the
group's total load to drop below its total cpu_power
(ie. cause the group to start going idle).
