To clarify further, below are the API and the use case of my userspace 
implementation. The guasi_fd() gives you back a pollable (POLLIN) fd to be 
integrated in your prefered event retrieval interface. Once it fd is 
signaled, you can fetch your completed requests using guasi_fetch() and 
schedule work based on that.
The GUASI implementation uses pthreads, but it is clear that an in-kernel 
async syscall implementation can take wiser decisions, and optimize the 
heck out of it (locks, queues, ...).
