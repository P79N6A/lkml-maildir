Question. Which of the following files will first be executed if

Answer; Anything that looks exciting. I'd go for death, but the less bold
might try corruption first. Things that are only harmful get no attention
at all.
In the 'olden' days, stuff in /sbin was considered off-limits without
the explicit written documentation at hand (Try to partition a hard-
disk under Ultrix). When asked; "Do you want to write (Y/N)?", the
answers were not Y/N!  You had to look in the documentation and
find that the only way to commit the write was by typing
"Yes, absolutely, positively!"
This helped keep the learners from destroying their systems.
Cheers,
