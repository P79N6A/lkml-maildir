Kyle,
Great work, and thanks for making the much needed fork!
I have a couple of suggestions.
> Microsoft employees Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive

http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), wrote that "Linux. . .is trusted

Good things about Linux are the focus of this announcement.  Microsoft
are great to quote, but they're not the focus so don't start a paragraph
with them.  The ellipsis looks suspicious.  The URL clutters.  The
paragraph is too long.  The things people remember are: the first and
last things.
    In a competitive examination (the so-called "Halloween Document"[1]),
    Vinod Valloppillil and Josh Cohen of Microsoft Corporation write:
    "Linux has been deployed in mission critical, commercial environments
    with an excellent pool of public testimonials."
    Linux is also "trusted in mission critical applications, and - due to
    it's open source code - has a long term credibility which exceeds many
    other competitive operating systems."  We agree 100% with Microsoft.

I've put the paragraph break in because it makes the first quote more
memorable.  The 100% sentence is my touch :-)
My other suggestion is: go back to "NT" instead of "Windows NT"
everywhere.  Everyone knows what NT is, and the Northen Telecom(tm)
trademark bit is too good to lose -- I'd love to see it enter the public
consciousness.
