IMHO It reduces the flexibility of the scheme and makes it not extendable. 
Leads to a large quantity of macros that are difficult to manage. 
Also some higher level functions may want to have the mode passed to them 
as parameters. See f.e. include/linux/buffer_head.h. Without the 
parameters you will have to maintain farms of definitions for all cases.
