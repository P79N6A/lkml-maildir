That sounds bizarre. I'd expect some kind of reply, even if merely an
error. I suppose "no reply" could be interpreted as "ESRCH", though
this means distinguishing between "some field caused an error" and
"the thing is dead" means the app has to fall back to requesting fields
one at a time.

The race is in the app, not the kernel, so there's nothing to fix in
the kernel apart from distinctions between ESRCH and EPERM in error
reporting (otherwise the app is helpless to resolve the ambiguity).

If all errors are handled with "no reply", userspace loses some
efficiency, as it's forced to retry field accesses one at a time and
wait for timeouts on each of them for a dead/inaccessible task.

This I can't answer.
