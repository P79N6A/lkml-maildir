Because they are managed by 2 different entities. the struct device
objects are managed by device core and driver-specific objects are
managed by their respective driver.

Why? If the driver truly stops hardware then any driver-specific data
is not needed. With sysfs severing access to removed attributes there
is no need to gave "global release", cleanup can be done in stages.

To a degree.
