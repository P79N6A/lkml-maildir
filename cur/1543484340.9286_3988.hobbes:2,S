Hi Zelazko,

You didn't say how you "removed SMP from .config".  If you did this
with a text editor, then you must run "make oldconfig" or some other
"make *config" command again after you edit .config.  That could be
your problem.
If you have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS turned on, then you have to run 'make dep'
every time you change the configuration.  As of 2.2.2-pre1, this is a
documented requirement, and "make *config" will remind you to do it.
If CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is turned on, some options such as CONFIG_SMP,
CONFIG_PROCFS, and a few others require "make mrproper" if you change
them.  This is a bug and will be fixed in a fugure 2.2 release.
(The bug is that the kernel/module ABI depends on several configuration
options, and CONFIG_MODVERSIONS does not handle this properly when a
user changes one of the options that causes the ABI to shift).
