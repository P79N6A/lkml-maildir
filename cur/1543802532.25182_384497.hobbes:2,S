Greetings,
I've run into a problem building 2.6.15.  Starting with my 2.6.14
.config file, I ran oldconfig to generate a .config for 2.6.15.
Running "make" results in:
      LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
    kernel/built-in.o: In function `do_exit':
    : undefined reference to `exit_io_context'
    mm/built-in.o: In function `generic_write_checks':
    : undefined reference to `bdev_read_only'
    mm/built-in.o: In function `__generic_file_aio_write_nolock':
    : undefined reference to `bdev_read_only'
    mm/built-in.o: In function `__alloc_pages':
    : undefined reference to `blk_congestion_wait'
    mm/built-in.o: In function `__alloc_pages':
    : undefined reference to `blk_congestion_wait'
Makefile indicates that KALLSYMS is involved in building this target,
so here are two combinations of KALLSYMS settings that result in the
same problem:
CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y
# CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not set
# CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not set
CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y
# CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL is not set
CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS=y
Makefile mentions that the maintainers are working on problems with
kallsyms, which is why I'm reporting this problem.
If you need any more info (such as a copy of .config), let me know.
Regards,
David
