      I'd like to ask architecture maintainers (especially ia64, PPC, Sparc 
   and Sparc64 maintainers) for verification that my changes did not break 
   anything... I tested only i386, but changes were obvious...
I'll test this out up after Linus releases a pre-patch with this
included.
As a side note, this thing is so tiny (less than 4K on sparc64!) so
why don't we just include it unconditionally instead of having all
of this "turn it on for these drivers" stuff?
