This is the recommended one.
- simple to implement and understand on both sides
- if you change units, you notice breaking userspace immediately
  and can even notice it being used in closed source tools 
  with a simple strace
- no parsing involved, as the author of the user space tool 
  usually assumes the unit implicitly (like "programming by contract", where
  the "contract" is the filename, which is quite easy to check for.
- you can keep a legacy interface with neglible effort and code wastage
- many advantages I forgot :-)
