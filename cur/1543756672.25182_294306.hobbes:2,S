Talked to Matt Dobson and explained him the CKRM architecture and how
cpuset/memset can be implemented as a ckrm controller. He is now convinced
that there is no problem in making memset also a ckrm controller.
As explained in the earlier mail, memset also can be implemented in the
same way as cpuset.
