Ugh, what a waste of kernel space.
This can be done just as well from userspace..
After you've made a kernel..
	mv System.map /boot/System.map-`uname -r`
And edit the script which is starting syslog so that just before
it starts the deamon it it says..
	ln -sf /boot/System.map-`uname -r` /boot/System.map
regards,
Dave.
