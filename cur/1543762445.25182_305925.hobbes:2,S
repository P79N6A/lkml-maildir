I enabled these:
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_STAT=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_POWERSAVE=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_USERSPACE=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND=y
  CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_TABLE=y
  CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO=y
  CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI=y
  CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_TABLE=y
It should have worked, shouldn't it?
Well, it did not.  You can look at the kernel messages at
http://dl.fefe.de/dmesg.gz
 if that helps.
No cpufreq, and as far as I can see, no speedstep.
The fan is running, that's all I can tell.
