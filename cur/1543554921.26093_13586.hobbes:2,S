One way to do this is to treat PCI IO and ISA IO as two separate
address spaces.  The PCI IO address space is a 14-bit address space
(bits 9:8 are always zero) ranging from 0x1000 to 0xFCFF.  ISA IO is a
10-bit space (bits 15:10 are available for the card to use) ranging
from 0x100 to 0x3FF.
VGA cards may be PCI and AGP, but still have allocations in the ISA
range.
