I said as much in an article to LinuxToday.  (They buried it under a page of 
commentary about Ransom Love, but they did post it.)

BSD forked to death in the 80's.  Everybody from AT&T to Sun to IBM who saw 
money in it spun off their own incompatable, proprietary version.
If MS was currently facing BSD rather than LInux, they would have "embrace 
and extend"ed it long ago.  Hide half of office in the system libraries (just 
like windows), come out with a closed-source version, loot the open 
competition for any advances but don't share yours...

The GPL was designed to block embrace and extend.  It embraces and extends 
right back.  And it's torquing microsoft off big time.

Just like AT&T did to free Unix in ~1984.  How long before it's "Office for 
BSD incidentally distributed with a closed-source copy of BSD" mutated into 
"yet another incompatable proprietary operating system, just with lots of 
unix code."
That wouldn't solve anything.  We've been through a few years with netscape 
as our only viable web browser on linux, how much fun was that?
Rember the ben franklin quote about exchanging liberty for safety.  Buying 
short-term gains with long-term sacrifices is a dumb idea.  Been there.  Done 
that.  Came here to recover.
