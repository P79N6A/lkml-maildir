4k page size * 2GB = 8TB.
i consider it much more likely on such systems that the page size will
be increased to maybe 16 or 64k which would give us 32TB or 128TB.
you keep on trying to increase the size of types without looking at
what gcc outputs in the way of code that manipulates 64-bit types.
seriously, why don't you just try it?  see what the performance is.
see what the code size is.  then come back with some numbers.  and i mean
numbers, not `it doesn't feel any slower'.
personally, i'm going to see what the situation looks like in 5 years time
and try to solve the problem then.  there're enough real problems with the
VFS today that i don't feel inclined to fix tomorrow's potential problems.
