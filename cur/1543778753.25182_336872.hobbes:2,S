Subject: RFC: Raise required gcc version to 3.2 ?

What is the oldest gcc we want to support in kernel 2.6?
Currently, it's 2.95 .
I'd suggest raising this to 3.2 which should AFAIK not be a problem for 
any distribution supporting kernel 2.6 .
Is there any good reason why we should not drop support for older 
compilers?
