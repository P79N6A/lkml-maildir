Subject: [PATCH 0/2] RT: Enhance PREEMPT_TRACE with deeper stacks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This series changes the PREEMPT-TRACE behavior for reporting critical
sections.  The previous code reported 2 frames per section.  The new code uses
the save_stack_trace facility to save an arbitrary number of frames (currently
set to 5 via a #define)
For what its worth, these patches assisted me with debugging some issues in
-rt.  The second patch is really a workaround for where X86_64 frame-pointers
apparently are not working under certain circumstances.
