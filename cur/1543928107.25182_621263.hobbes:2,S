Under which case of power mode should the controller driver change the voltage again when a dual voltage card is detected?

To be completely correct, the MMC layer should probably power down the card first, yes. Right now most drivers will handle all of these things as they see fit. Haven't seen a single bug report about it yet so...
Just change the voltage in whatever way makes sense for your controller.
