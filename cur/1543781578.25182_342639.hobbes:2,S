Yes.  And "maintenance" I presume means "copy" the kernel headers and
do some cleanup to be compliant to the relevant standards (which the
kernel maintainers couldn't be bothered to do).

I agree about obsolete junk.
However statements like "No kernel headers can be included by userland
anymore" can be slightly misleading.
