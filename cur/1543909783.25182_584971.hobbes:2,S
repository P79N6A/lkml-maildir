Yes, that's what's called "compilation unit" :-)
[/me double checks]
Erm, the C standard actually calls it "translation unit".
To be exact, to avoid any more confusion:
5.1.1.1/1:
A C program need not all be translated at the same time. The
text of the program is kept in units called source files, (or
preprocessing files) in this International Standard. A source
file together with all the headers and source files included
via the preprocessing directive #include is known as a
preprocessing translation unit. After preprocessing, a
preprocessing translation unit is called a translation unit.
