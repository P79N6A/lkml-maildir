You can always use a symbolic link from /usr/src/linux to, say,
/home/myself/src/kernel/linux ... Nobody but root is writing to /usr/src,
but the kernel source is in the expected location for anything that needs
to look for it.
Plus you only need to be root to install the kernel, you can configure and
build (and read the docs) as yourself.
