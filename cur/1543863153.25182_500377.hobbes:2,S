Except that you're wrong above.  Most 512 MB flash cards are less than 
512 MiB; most of them are, in fact, around 512 MB!  RAM, of course, is 
consistently 512 MiB.
This little tidbit discovered in the process of working on an 
application which required powers-of-two flash cards, and finding that 
one does have to use one size larger...
