I gave up on that for now ;) 
I received a couple of  emails from others who had problems
with the 845G which I did not have.
So, I put together another machine with a spare Intel 845GBVL 
motherboard, which also has the 845G chipset.
IDE and DMA seem to work when running 2420pre5ac1, but
no DMA in 2420pre5.
Now on the other hand the Gigabyte (845G chipset) works with
2420pre5 (DMA, ide-scsi) but no success with 2420pre5ac1.
In looking at the lspci's of both boards, I noticed a difference. I
put excerpts
below along with links to full dmesg/lspci.
Bizarre and wierdness sums it up. Which is the real 845G?
Which machine do I dropkick? ;)
