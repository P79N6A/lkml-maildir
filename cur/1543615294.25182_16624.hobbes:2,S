Obviously -ffreestanding isn't, because this problem could crop up pretty
much anywhere.  The involvement of standard library functions is almost
coincidence and so -ffreestanding would only fix the current symptom.
I'm not much of a kernel hacker, but a quick (and not very efficient,
granted) fix could be to make the offset an extern variable, yes?  That
would force the compiler to fall back on the basic "your gun, your foot,
your choice" memory model.
