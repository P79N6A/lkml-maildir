   The problem is that if the chip is configured for MSI (through config
   space) and the platform's irq mapping code therefore filled in
   pci_dev->irq with an appropriate vector for the MSI interrupt the chip
   is assigned instead of the LSI interrupt it may also be assigned, then
   unless MSGINT_MODE matches PCI_MSI_FLAGS_ENABLE, the driver will grab
   wrong interrupt.
Why isn't it enabled at the point where we save the extended state?
