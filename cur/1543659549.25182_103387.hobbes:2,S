execcap doesn't work.
Long story: Linux capabilities don't really work as POSIX intended them 
to work without filesystem support. I am not working on this these days, 
although there are some mostly complete patches on kernel.org for old 
kernels.
Because of the ambiguity of what setuid() does with the behavior I 
discussed in this old email, when combined with certain setuid-0 
programs, we had to make the kernel's default policy less like POSIX and 
more like the legacy superuser model.
You used to be able to make it work as it did in the examples below by 
raising the inheritable set and lowering the cap_bound set (which is 
another hack POSIX didn't specify).
In the absence of filesystem support for capabilities, various folk have 
come up with their own ways of leveraging the capabilities to implement 
some security models. I fear that completing the capability support as 
the POSIX draft defines them will break these other approaches.
I hope that helps clarify what you are seeing.
Cheers
