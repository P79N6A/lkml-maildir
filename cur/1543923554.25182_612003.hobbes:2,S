It definitely is useful in our case, since its a requirement for 
this "critical" project. It's not needed to have such a short trigger time 
while booting, but unfortunately this external watchdog only supports one 
fixed timeout.

No, I'm afraid it's not configurable in this case.

I already have it running on my system using a quick hack (see patch below) in 
include/asm-ppc/nmi.h (yes, still arch/ppc for now :-( ). But for a clean 
implementation, that has chances for upstream merge (in arch/powerpc later), 
I would really like to hear if I should move on further this way. 
My impression is, that changing the name from touch_nmi_watchdog() to 
something like touch_watchdog(), and therefore touching lots of files, makes 
it more unlikely that this resulting patch will get accepted. But 
implementing this bootup watchdog support in asm-ppc(asm-powerpc)/nmi.h 
header seems also not totally correct, since it's not really an NMI in this 
case.
Any thoughts on this?
Thanks.
Best regards,
Stefan
