No, it is gross and it bloats the kernel.  It inlines a bunch of junk
for N error paths, as opposed to having the exit code once at the end. 
Cache footprint is key and you just killed it.
Nor is it easier to read.
As a final argument, it does not let us cleanly do the usual stack-esque
wind and unwind, i.e.
	do A
	if (error)
		goto out_a;
	do B
	if (error)
		goto out_b;
	do C
	if (error)
		goto out_c;
	goto out;
	out_c:
	undo C
	out_b:
	undo B:
	out_a:
	undo A
	out:
	return ret;
Now stop this.
