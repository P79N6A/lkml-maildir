Arguably, we can't be sure that the bug wasn't worked on just because there's
no confirmation of that in the Bugzilla.  It _probably_ wasn't, but in fact
that's uncertain.
OTOH, in both cases above you can't even assume that the appropriate developer
was _aware_ of the bug report.
Which, BTW, is a problem even with the Bugzilla as it is configured today: it
doesn't give you any guarantee that the bug report is heard of by the right
people (unless, of course, it's forwarded to them by Andrew, that is, but this
"mechanism" is not exactly a part of the Bugzilla itself ;-)).
For this reason, I'd like the maintainers/developers of every subsystem to
provide us with an address of a mailing list considered as appropriate for
sending bug reports related to this particular subsystem.  Then, we can make
the Bugzilla forward bug reports to these lists, so that Andrew or anyone else
need not handle that manually.
Now, if we have such lists set up for all subsystems, we'll be able to just
tell users to send bug reports there, either using the Bugzilla, or directly,
with the assumption that the right people get those reports.
Then, the "we didn't know about the report" kind of excuse won't be viable any
more and we'll be able to exert more directed pressure at the subsystems that
aren't good enough at handling bugs.
Greetings,
Rafael
