To successfully attach to a particular address the following
constraints must hold:
	1) The address is congruent to zero modulo SHMLBA (unless
	   SHM_RND flag is provided).
	1) The address is not contained within the bounds of the
	   process stack and stack growth area
	3) The address must not be already mapped by an existing
	   mapping (e.g. existing shm segment, mmap'ed region, 
	   program text/data/bss, shared object text/data, etc).
	   (unless SHM_REMAP, a non-standard flag, is provided).
It is generally not portable to map shared memory segments to
a particular virtual address, certainly not between flavors
of unix, and potentially even between revisions of the linux
kernel.  Better to let the kernel provide the address and 
use base-relative offset addressing within the shared memory
segment.
Oracle, for instance, does attach its SGA (shared global area)
to a fixed virtual address (0x50000000 under linux, IIRC).
