Analogous though slightly different suggestion: have a "Tree" column
just where Mozilla have their (quite analogous) "OpSys" field. Compare
       
http://bugme.osdl.org/queryhelp.cgi#bugsettings
       
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/queryhelp.cgi#bugsettings
This way people can set their queries, and triagers manage triage, in
such a way that nothing shows on anyone's radar until it's actually
relevant to them. (Whether a tree appears in the list would be up to its
maintainer, I guess.)
Caveat: although *queries* for (say) "-ac OR -dj" are possible, the
fields themselves are still single-valued. So there ought to be an
agreement that a bug doesn't get promoted to "All" trees just because
it's been confirmed on more than one.
(This has been a recurring problem in Mozilla -- e.g. people have tended
to flag PPC bugs against "All" OSes when they only meant Apple OSes, not
NetBSD or Linux PPC. Multi-valuedness would be the clean solution but
unfortunately, afaik, Bugzilla doesn't support it for those fields.)
