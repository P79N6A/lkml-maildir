Confused.  This patch conflicts a lot with James's one (which I named
voyager-fix-build-broken-by-shift-to-smp_ops.patch).
If your "i386: move common parts of smp into their own file" also fixes
Voyager and is preferred then cool, but a) the changelog should tell us
that and b) could James please test it?
