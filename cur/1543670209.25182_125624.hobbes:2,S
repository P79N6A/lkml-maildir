You should definitely mention this to your distribution creator.  IMHO, it's
seriously broken if uname -r isn't distinct.  Debian is unfortunately a
victim of this; I have modded my kernel-image source package to *fix* it.  I
don't recall RedHat having this problem, but other RPM based I don't know.
Can you say what your distro is?
Cheers,
Jeremy
