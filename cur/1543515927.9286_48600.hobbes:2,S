Subject: linux-2.3.37/drivers/usb/usb_scsi.c does not compile (+ probably incorrect fix)

	linux-2.3.27/drivers/usb/usb_scsi.c refers to the undefined
symbol PROC_SCSI_USB_SCSI.  The line that refers to it has a
comment that says "It's currently b0rken", so perhaps everyone is
already aware that it does not compile.  Just in case, and for
the benefit of anyone else who is running into the problem, I
am sending this email.  I can make the module compile by adding
the following, probably incorrect, line:
#define PROC_SCSI_USB_SCSI	0,4,"scsi"
