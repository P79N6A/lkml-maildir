On a related theme, I have an Advansys 940UW controller
connected to a IBM DCHS04U which should allow for 40 MB/sec
of bandwidth. But /proc/scsi/advansys/0 reports:
...
  0: Transfer Period Factor: 12 (20.8 Mhz), REQ/ACK Offset: 8
Furthermore with tests using the SCSI READ BUFFER command I
can measure >30 MB/sec throughput. My guess is that this
ultra, u2 and u160 is done at a lower level and hidden
from the messaging level lest older things get upset.
