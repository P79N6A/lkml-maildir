I'm maintaing machines that pre-exist me and many don't have
vmlinuz-`uname -r` naming and can't quite reboot the machine on
different kernels just to find out what it is.
Did the symlink think but it got ugly after a while when I had 6 kernel,
6 System.map files and a bunch of symlinks.  Once I fully drop the 2.4
on this set of machines I can move back but it was just ugly for a
while.
