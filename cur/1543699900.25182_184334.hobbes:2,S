Andi,
My fist intention was exactly same as yours, but if all access were done 
through pci_dev...
Unfortunately, you can't store ioremap()'ed address for 4k within 
pci_dev and then simply use it.
In all places around, config accessed through (bus,dev,fn) indexes.
If you want to keep virt. addr. footprint small, the only alternative to 
fixmap is some kind of LRU cache for dozen of devices.
When choosing between fixmap and LRU cache, I would choose fixmaps. It 
is very simple and clear, low virt. addr. and comparable overhead.
Vladimir.
