Alan,
Actually I have tried 1x,2x,3x.  In 2.4.0 to 2.4.3 I had some issues but 
never a system freeze of any kind.  With 2.4.4 I had more problems, but 
I was ok.  2.4.5 I now have these freezes.  Maybe I should go back to 
2x, but I still find this behavior crazy.
This still doesn't negate the point of freeing simple caches.
