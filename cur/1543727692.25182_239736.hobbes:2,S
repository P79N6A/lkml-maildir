Subject: architectures with their own "config PCMCIA"

The following architetures have their own "config PCMCIA" instead of 
including drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig (in 2.6.8-rc3-mm1):
- m68k
- s390
- sparc
- sparc64
Is there any good reason for this, or would a patch to change these 
architectures to include drivers/pcmcia/Kconfig be OK?
