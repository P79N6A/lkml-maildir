I had time to try this with 2.6.12.5, I was not able to reproduce the
error there.
I also found the following post on LKML:

The above server is currently unreachable from my part of the net but
Bret Towe seemed to have the same problem as I have. Since the problem
also appears when using 2.6.14-rc3 I think the patch should be looked at
and maybe considered for inclusion. As soon as I gain access to that
patch I will test it and report my results.
