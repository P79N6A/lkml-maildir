> randconfig testing on .23-rc2 triggered the following build error:
When building NOR flash support, you have compile-time options for the
bus width and the number of individual chips which are interleaved
together onto that bus. The code to deal with arbitrary geometry is a
bit convoluted, and people want to just configure it for the specific
hardware they have, to avoid the runtime overhead.
Selecting _none_ of the available options doesn't make any sense. You
should have at least one. This makes it build though, since people
persist in trying.
