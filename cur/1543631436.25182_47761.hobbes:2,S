Salutations, 
The ppp_deflate.o module has the license string "BSD without
advertisement clause". Loading this module appears to taint the
kernel, which agrees with the allowed licenses list in
include/module.h, and with list in latest modutils (2.4.16),
obj/obj_gpl_license, where this license string does not appear.
I plead an utter lack of clue in regards to licenses, but assume that
it's GPL compatible if it's distributed with the kernel. In that case,
shouldn't it be added to the license list?
Thanks,
