[agreed, except:]
There is no significant performance difference between NUMA on and off
on the crippled boards. So best is to always enable CONFIG_NUMA on x86-64. 
The distribution kernels for x86-64 should ship in this configuration
too.
I would recommend to always disable node interleaved on the non crippled
board with multiple memory banks. Most boards ship with this disabled by 
default, only a few enable it.
