Returning a IRQ_HANDLED when the device didn't request for service, in the best case cuases interrupt latencies, in the worst (like in an ISA environment) impairs servicing requests from devices sharing the same IRQ line.

IRQ_HANDLED vs. IRQ_NONE has no effect on what interrupt handlers are 
called, etc. It is only used to detect if an interrupt is firing without 
being handled by any driver, in this case the kernel can detect this and 
disable the interrupt.
I'm not sure exactly why the driver is returning IRQ_HANDLED all the 
time, but edge-triggered interrupts are always tricky and there may be a 
case where it can't reliably detect this. Returning IRQ_HANDLED is the 
safe thing to do if you cannot be sure if your device raised an 
interrupt or not.
