You should probably send this to Jeff Garzik instead of Marcelo. Jeff
collects net driver patches.
If you don't, Shing Chuang's changes are in -pre7-ac2, so a re-diff vs
that and seding it to Alan Cox may cause less merge work.

I think that is an ok change. np could be initialised sooner instead but
I don't know why that would be better.

To trap things ... :)
Maybe there should be a trap for all the unhandled interrupt status error
events. via_rhine_interrupt could list more Intr flags as reasons to call
via_rhine_error, if you know which ones are errors.
