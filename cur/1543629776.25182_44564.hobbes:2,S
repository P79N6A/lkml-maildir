We can certainly do it, it just doesn't buy us much of anything, since
none of the standard tools (ie "ls") will actually do the readlink() for
anything but a symlink.
So at that point it's just another magic syscall, except we've overloaded
an old one.
Which may certainly be acceptable, of course.
