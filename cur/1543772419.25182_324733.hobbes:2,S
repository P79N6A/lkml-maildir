I think it has or the strange software memhole (what is that?)

You could verify that by disabling PREEMPT. Butactually it should
not be that bad.
From your oopses i more suspect it is hardware actually:

It crashes on first accessing newly allocated memory for page tables.
Most likely something is wrong with your memory or memory map.
Maybe it is related to your "discrete mtrr mapping" or your "software
memhole" whatever they are? I would suggest to try without these.
