Once I know that the message is harmless, I don't need to worry about it.
But it would be nice if 2.6.0 would automatically update /etc/fstab the way
2.4.19 did.  I assume that the new hotplug scripts will do that.
By the way, since we had some discussion of USB keyboards, I want to mention
that it is separate (so far) from the keyboard problems that I've reported
for 2.6.0-test1 through test3.  So far I've only tested 2.6.0 on machines
with PS/2 keyboards (or emulations thereof).  Considering the patch for
test1 which still hasn't made it into test3, maybe I ought to try connecting
a USB keyboard to one machine soon.  Meanwhile I don't dare to even try
2.6.0 on a machine which depends on its USB keyboard (no PS/2 ports and
cessation of BIOS emulation when the OS boots).
