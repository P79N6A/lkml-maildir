I thought of doing that too, but then all the various %pX formats would all
have to print the same for NULL pointers.  For instance a resource prints
out like "[0x1000-0x100f]", so I chose "[NULL]" for printing a null
resource pointer.  Maybe "[]" or "[-]" would be better?  A null MAC address
could be ":::::" or "x:x:x:x:x:x".  "N.U.L.L" or "x.x.x.x" for a null IP4
address.  And so on.  So the printout looks nicer when a NULL pointer isn't
a bug.
