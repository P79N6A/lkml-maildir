The kernel headers are _still_ not meant to be used by userspace,
so don't try that.  If you don't want to use glibc headers - you get to 
write
your own headers.  You can extract info from the kernel headers, but they
cannot be used directly from userspace programs.  They are not designed to
be used that way.
