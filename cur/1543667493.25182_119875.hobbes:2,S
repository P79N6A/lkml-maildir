Hi !
I tried linux-2.5.65-ac3 with ide-disk and ide-scsi drivers both built in
the Kernel.
Two ide-disks attached to ide0, two CDROMS attached to ide1.
Im using the sis5513-PCI-IDE-Driver, but configuring it out makes no difference.
The System hangs while booting with last messages
	ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
	ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
It seems that all Drives went twice in the driver-list, so ata_attach
gets called twice for them, which leads to the hang.
Dirty Hack that works for me below.
Regards,
	Norbert
