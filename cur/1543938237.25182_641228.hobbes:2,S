Maybe the difference is not in timeout but what the driver does after
timeout happens.  After timeout, libata ignores almost everything (it
considers DMA error reported on BMDMA status) and resets the device
while IDE thinks that IRQ might be lost and complete the command if the
TF status register says so.
It could be that the particular device doesn't raise IRQ on certain
error conditions but updates TF registers.  After timeout, IDE completes
the command with the indicated error while libata ignores the status and
resets the device.
libata never touches TF register after timeout because some controllers
lock up hard if TF register is read after certain error conditions
(event the status register).
