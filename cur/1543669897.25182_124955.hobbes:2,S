Okay. Yes 7.0 and 7.1 are the CD/ROMs that I had at home.
I know RH is at 8.0 now. I will try to install the
stuff I have at work on the home CPU, I just brought
my SCSI drive and cloned everything. I will boot
from a floppy first, then LILO or grib the drive if
it boots okay. I just wanted to check if I was going
to have any other problems. Thanks.
Cheers,
