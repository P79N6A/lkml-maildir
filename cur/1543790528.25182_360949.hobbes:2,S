Hi Matt,
Here's another patch.  This one allows for local alternative url paths.
As you know, I use ketchup for Thomas Gleixner's ktimers.  He also
stores his archives differently than everyone else.  So I have as
my .ketchuprc the following.
local_trees = {
	'2.6-kt': (latest_dir,
		"
http://www.tglx.de/projects/ktimers/patch-
%(full)s.patch",
		r'patch-(2.6.*?)',
		0, "Thomas Gleixner's ktimers."),
	'2.6-kthrt': (latest_dir,
		"
http://www.tglx.de/projects/ktimers/patch-
%(full)s.patch",
		r'patch-(2.6.*?)',
		0, "Thomas Gleixner's ktimers and HRT patches.")
}
local_alturls = {
	'/ktimers/' : "/ktimers/archive/"
}
With the below patch to grab the older ktimer patches.
Now, I would like to let you know that I've only written one program in
python for all my life.  So I am not very comfortable writing code for
it. So if you can clean this up, I wouldn't mind.  For now, this works
for me.
