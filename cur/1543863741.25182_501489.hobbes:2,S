Subject: [RFC PATCH -rt 0/2] RCU priority boosting that survives semi-vicious testing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
This is an update of the patch at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/01/15/219.
This series contains (1) the RCU-boost patch itself and (2) some
rcutorture modifications to test it more thoroughly.  This version is
getting quite close.
There is still no OOM tie-in.  As before, dynamic adjustment of the
booster's priority will dynamically adjust the boostees.
						Thanx, Paul
