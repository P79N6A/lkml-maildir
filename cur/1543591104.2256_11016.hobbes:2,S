And how are you thinking of this working "without introducing new 
interfaces" if the caches are indeed incoherent? Please correct me if I 
understand wrong, but when two caches are incoherent, I thought it means 
that the above _would_ screw up unless protected by exclusive write locking 
as I suggested in my previous post with the side effect that you can't 
write the boot block without unmounting the filesystem or modifying some 
interface somewhere.
As not all filesystems are like ext2, perhaps it would be better to fix 
ext2 and not the cache coherency? If ext2 is claiming ownership of a 
device, then it should do so in its entirety IMHO. You could always extend 
ext2 to use the NTFS approach where the bootsector is nothing more than a 
file which happens to exist on sector(s) zero (and following) of the 
device... (just a thought)
Best regards,
Anton
