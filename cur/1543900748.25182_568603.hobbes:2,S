as a trivial example, i can demonstrate on include/asm-mips/ioctl.h.
once the generic ioctl.h file is enhanced, then the entire mips
ioctl.h file is reduced from 94 lines to:
===================================
#define _IOC_SIZEBITS	13
#define _IOC_DIRBITS	3
#define _IOC_NONE	1U
#define _IOC_READ	2U
#define _IOC_WRITE	4U
#include <asm-generic/ioctl.h>
/*
 * The following are included for compatibility
 */
#define _IOC_VOID	0x20000000
#define _IOC_OUT	0x40000000
#define _IOC_IN		0x80000000
#define _IOC_INOUT	(IOC_IN|IOC_OUT)
=================================
and the last part of that is purely MIPS-specific content.
  there are at least a couple other ioctl.h files that could be
reduced even further.  asm-parisc/ioctl.h would subsequently become
all of four lines:
=================================
#define _IOC_NONE	0U   (this line isn't even necessary)
#define _IOC_WRITE	2U
#define _IOC_READ	1U
#include <asm-generic/ioctl.h>
=================================
etc, etc.
