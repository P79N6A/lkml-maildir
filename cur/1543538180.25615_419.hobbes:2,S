Release 0.6.1: Tue Jul  4 06:07:08 EDT 2000
	* "source" now has cpp-like relative-path behavior.
	* Everybody's most-requested front-end feature; choices menus and 
	  discrete ranges are now edited through pulldown menus in the Tk
	  front end.
There are about a dozen active beta testers.  Three subsystem
maintainers have certified the translations of their pieces of CML1.
The CML2 rulebase is no longer simply a translation of CML1. William Stearns
and others have contributed substantial information on bus dependencies in
various drivers.
If I don't get any nontrivial bug reports in the next week, the next
release will be 0.9.0 and I'll announce final-beta status (I won't
call it 1.0.0 until I'm confident of all or nearly all of the CML1
translation).
