How do you test whether a x86 merge might break the compilation of 
e.g. some ARM platform without using any defconfig?
And building all defconfigs is the trivial way of having most reasonable 
configurations covered with only one day of compile time.

My goal was "one per subarchitecture" which is not such a big number.
At least for the patches I'm sending more defconfigs reduce the 
probability of me introducing bugs (and I might e.g. again work
a bit on improving our headers mess in the future).
