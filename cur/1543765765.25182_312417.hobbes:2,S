Umm, no.  It's absolutely not a good reason.  What jffs2 is doing right
now is to poke into VFS internals it shouldn't, and exporting more internals
to prevent it from doing so isn't making the situation any better.
The VFS already has a method for freeing an struct inode pointer, and that
is ->destroy_inode.  You're probably better off updating your GC state from
that place.
