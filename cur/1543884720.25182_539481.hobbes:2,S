Can you send your compile warnings ? I couldn't find the same in my
mailbox any report on the same. Maybe my mail filter did something.

What i would like to do is like this: Have the current state frozen as
it is, such that there is a fallback case (The dst is quite fragile and
change at some place would break another. ie, what looks good for one
DST variant is bad for the other). Work on a new tree (CX878) and
migrate stuff to it. Remove the old one, once things are done.
I wouldn't want to mess up the current working situation and hence.
