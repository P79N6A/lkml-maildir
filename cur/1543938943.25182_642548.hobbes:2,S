So I got curious, and dropped the patch onto my workstation - 24-rc8-mm1 x86_64
and it applied just fine with an offset reported.
Before the patch, the drift was reported as 140.67 or so.
After, it's sitting at -0.681.
Am running with hpet clocksource rather than acpi_pm, which probably explains
the 140 I see rather than the 280 John saw....
