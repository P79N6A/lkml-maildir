This is noise guys, skip it....
I will have appreciate that you apology to me, not to Alan.
For you concern, I love black humor, I do make nonsense most
of the time (but I hope to learn from my mistakes) and yes
I work for SUN.
Regarding the 2.5 kernel being available, I don't honestly
know but I will suggest you stay with 2.4 for a while, you
still have some stuff to learn.
Ludo.

Oh I've missed the context that it was just about kernel space - oops 
sorry
Anyway where is the wishlist for 2.5 publically available ?
