Hi Russell,
Would something like the following be a reasonable way of detecting a NatSemi
PC16552 UART?:
	if type == 16650A
	then
		set LCR.DLAB to 1
		if EFR bits 7-3 are 0
		then
			set EFR to 0xff
			if EFR == 0x07
			then
				set type to 16552
				set EFR to 0
			fi
		else
			restore EFR to previous value
		fi
	fi
This needs to be inserted before the test for the StarTech ST16650.
I've implemented by the attached patch against a 2.4.18 kernel.
