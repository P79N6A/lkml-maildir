You are thinking of connecting two scsi host adapters with a scsi cable?
With the other adapter in the same machine (emulation) or in 
another machine (for communication)?
That is indeed possible.  The adapter need to support "target mode". 
Not all
adapters do that.  And they need to have different scsi ID's, so one
must
move away from the default id of 7.
If the answer is yes,

Don't know.

Please tell!
Note that someone already did a "IP over scsi" where they could send
datagrams
from a host adapter in one machine to a host adapter in another. 
The speed was lousy last time I heard of it - nowhere near the max
throughput
of scsi.  Search the mailing list archives for more information.
Machines connected in this fashion may also share scsi devices.  The
read-only
cases are trivial, you must take grat care with anything writeable.
