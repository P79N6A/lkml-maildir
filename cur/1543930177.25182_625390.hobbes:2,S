The OOM killer triggers where there is no way to fulfill a page request.
Something has to go and there is no real notion of "right" or "wrong"
process at that point.
You can either set no overcommit in which case you'll get failed malloc
and similar rather than allow overcommit, or you can set the OOM priority
of tasks yourself so that your specific app of choice always dies first.
