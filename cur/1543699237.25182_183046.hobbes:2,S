Well, according to my sources FAT16 cannot sustain any partition larger 
than 2GiB, so 80GiB is probably a lot more than it can handle. Anyway, 
sdb1 is lacking any type of header and sdb containt something, but not a 
FAT header afaik. So probably theres just a partition table entry but 
not formatted.
