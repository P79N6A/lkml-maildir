Just refuse anything needing CAP_SYS_RAWIO at all times. Thats why this
capability flag exists. Or with SELinux you can create a role which has
RAWIO access but is very limited in other ways (eg "Only my X server",
or "only the firmware loader for my serial card") and which is tainted
if anything else touches those files
