Hi,
I just built this SMP system and am getting some weird
errors from kern.log.  The system will run smoothly but
after about a half hour running the distributed.net RC5
client, the following errors show up.
Feb  3 04:40:18 continuum kernel: stuck on TLB IPI wait
(CPU#0)
Feb  3 04:40:23 continuum last message repeated 4 times
Feb  3 04:40:45 continuum last message repeated 4 times
Feb  3 04:40:56 continuum kernel: stuck on TLB IPI wait
(CPU#1)
Feb  3 04:41:02 continuum last message repeated 2 times
The system doesn't actually crash but it does slow to a
crawl such that you can't really do anything with it.  It
is an Abit VP6 motherboard running 2 P-III 850 CPUs at
100MHZ bus speed.  256MB of PC133 micron ram.
If anyone knows whether this is a kernel issue or a
hardware one, I would appreciate hearing from you.
Shane
