Right, point taken.

Here we very much agree. The way I'd like it:
struct async_syscall {
	unsigned long nr_sysc;
	unsigned long params[8];
	long result;
};
int async_exec(struct async_syscall *a, int n);
or:
int async_exec(struct async_syscall **a, int n);
At this point I'm ok even with the userspace ring buffer, returning 
back pointers to "struct async_syscall".
