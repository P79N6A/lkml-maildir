Subject: How does 2.6 SMP scheduler initially assign a thread to a run queue?

In the 2.6 kernel, there is one run queue per CPU, in case of an SMP.
After a thread is created, how does the scheduler determine which run
queue it goes to?  I know that once it goes to a particular run queue,
the scheduler would try to run that thread on that CPU to take
advantage of processor affinity; and then there would be the load
balancing stuff.  But at the very beginning, what algorithm does the
scheduler use to assign a newly created thread to a particulat CPU?
Would the load balancing algorithm be used? Or gang scheduling?
By the way, in an SMT/hyperthreading processor, does the latest kernel
version assign one run queue per physical CPU, or per virtual processor?
