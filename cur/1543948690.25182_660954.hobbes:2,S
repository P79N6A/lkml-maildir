Hi Ingo,
CC'ed Steven Rostedt 
I found the following patch cause regression by bisect.
2.6.25-rc2-mm1:                            doesn't boot
2.6.25-rc2-mm1 + revert following patch:   works well
but I think it is very strange.
runqueue_is_locked() seems simple and have not bug. ;)
What do you think this problem?

    printk: dont wake up klogd with the rq locked
    It is not wise to place a printk where the runqueue lock is held.
