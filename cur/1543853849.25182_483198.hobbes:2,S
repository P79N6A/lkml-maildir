I looked into this back when SRCU was first added.  It's essentially
impossible to do it, because the per-cpu memory allocation & usage APIs
are completely different for the static and the dynamic cases.  They are a
real mess.  I couldn't think up a way to construct any sort of uniform
interface to per-cpu memory, not without completely changing the guts of 
the per-cpu stuff.
If you or someone else can fix that problem, I will be happy to change the 
SRCU-based notifiers to work both ways.
