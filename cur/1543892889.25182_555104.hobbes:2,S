what utter nonsense.  if i include tty.h, then i will be including
header files like workqueue.h and mutex.h and perhaps other rubbish i
have absolutely no interest in and don't want to waste my time
parsing.
if i choose to invest an extra minute or two and be more selective and
include only those headers which represent content i actually *need*,
then i have every right to be a bit put out if my build suddenly
fails.
if you don't agree with that patch, fine.  but suggesting that it's
going to result in "a mass of unresolvable dependancy loops" is sheer
laziness.
