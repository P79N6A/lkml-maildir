The 6.x series driver basically branched from the 5.x series driver.  
Changes made, many moons ago, are already in the 6.x series driver.
To quell your concerns, yes, stack overflow is not an issue with the
6.x series driver. 
I believe if we are to get anywhere regarding this issue, we need to 
shift focus from stack corruption in early versions of the driver.

Sorry, short introduction, Andrew Vasquez, Linux driver development at

I've personally never used LVM before, so I cannot even begin to
attempt to answer your question --  please work with the tech on this
one, if it's a driver problem, we'd like to fix it.
