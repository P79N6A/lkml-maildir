The hacky C program. Note that some fiddling with compiler flags is
needed to get it to compile at all, and you probably need to have
done make oldconfig or similar to prep the kernel tree too. The answer
necessarily varies with your .config and it won't work cross-arch
except in the 32/64 -bit variant case (in which case it must be
compiled as the same kind of app [32/64] the kernel is expected to be).
The expressions for the swap limits were taken from sys_swapon().
This should remove all doubt, if any remain.
#include <linux/config.h>
#include <linux/swap.h>
#include <asm/pgtable.h>
#include <linux/swapops.h>
int printf(const char *, ...);
int main(void)
{
	unsigned long long type, offset;
	type = swp_type(pte_to_swp_entry(swp_entry_to_pte(swp_entry(~0UL,0))));
	offset = swp_offset(pte_to_swp_entry(swp_entry_to_pte(swp_entry(0,~0UL)))) - 1;
	offset = (offset << PAGE_SHIFT) + ~PAGE_MASK;
	printf("max swapfiles = %Lu files\n", type);
	printf("max swapsize = %Lu B\n", offset);
	return 0;
}
