loop knows about an offset:
First find where your partitions are:
% sfdisk -l -uS hdc_img
Warning: hdc_img is not a block device
Disk hdc_img: cannot get size
Disk hdc_img: cannot get geometry
Disk hdc_img: 0 cylinders, 0 heads, 0 sectors/track
Units = sectors of 512 bytes, counting from 0
   Device Boot    Start       End   #sectors  Id  System
 hdc_img1            63    112454     112392  83  Linux
 hdc_img2        112455    401624     289170  82  Linux swap
 hdc_img3        401625  33736499   33334875   5  Extended
 ...
OK, let us mount this first one, at an offset of 63 sectors.
% bc
63*512
32256
# mount hdc_img /mnt -o loop,offset=32256
