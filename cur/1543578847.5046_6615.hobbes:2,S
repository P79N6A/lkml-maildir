When i upgraded to 2.4.0 i started having lots of ppp error.
Jan 14 00:25:01 glass kernel: PPP: VJ decompression error
Jan 14 00:25:41 glass kernel: PPP: VJ decompression error
Jan 14 00:25:45 glass kernel: PPP: VJ decompression error
With these errors ppp runs awefully and my downloads take atleast twice as
long to finish. I believe i have upgraded everything that is recommended
in the Changes file included in the kernel documentation.
Id gladly supply any other info needed.
thanks,
albeniz
