Hi,
I tried to search for posts regarding to the query_module but came up empty.
It seems to me that the sys_query_module call was removed from the 2.6
kernel. So the question I have is if there any alternative way to get the
kernel module symbols in 2.6. Or, I'm missing something here?
Thanks,
Naris
