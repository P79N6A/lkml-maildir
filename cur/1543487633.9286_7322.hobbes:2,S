   I thought about this way to workaround the Solaris bug infact. Maybe I
   missed some bit of TCPRFC, but I thought it was not possible because once
   Solairs didn't seen the FIN flag, it just interpreted the last octect of
   the FIN-full-of-data packet as data while it was a virtual octect. Am I
   wrong here?
No Andrea, I think Philip is completely right.
I concede, nobody wants to fix Solaris, everyone wishes to code
workarounds for other systems until they are blue in the face.
(What really ticks me off is that the response from people about
 Andrea's patch was "INSTALL THIS ON ALL YOUR FTP HTTP SERVERS"
 without one mention of "people with solaris systems should install
 the appropriate fixes", this makes me ill, and this leads us to
 have an internet with tcp implementations full of bandaids)
So I'll put the hack in some form into 2.2.3, even though I still
think this is all a crock.
