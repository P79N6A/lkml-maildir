Well it may work with CISCO routers, but most definitely not with CISCO
access servers (a AS5200 in my case).  Trying to get the correct image
that is supposed to work is a story in itself.  So far i was told:
  11.1 supported - but does not work
  11.2 not supported
  11.3 supported - should work (but in fact does not)
  12.x not supported
Sigh!
