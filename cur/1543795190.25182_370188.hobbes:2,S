First comment partly based on Jeff Garziks comments - if you added an
"operation" to the base functions and an operation mask to the DMA
engines it becomes possible to support engines that can do other ops (eg
abusing an NCR53c8xx for both copy and clear).
Second one - you obviously tested this somehow, was that all done by
simulation or do you have a "CPU" memcpy test engine for use before the
hardware pops up ?
