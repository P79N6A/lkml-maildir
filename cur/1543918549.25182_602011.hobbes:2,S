That sounds complex administratively. It means that instead of setting a 
higher or lower than default once and having it persist until reboot I 
have to create a script, which *will* in some cases be left in place 
even after the need has gone.
I agree with Ingo, once it's done it should be persistent.
And as another administrative convenience I can look at that set of 
values and see what shares are being used, even when the user is not 
currently active.
Final question, how do setuid processes map into this implementation?
