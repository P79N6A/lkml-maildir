Well, one reason names are bad is that they don't always exist.
If you only have the fd (remember that unix notion of using <stdin> and
<stdout>), you'd have no clue where the thing came from. So something else
than the name is certainly a good idea for some of these issues.
That said, I still think the real problem is rampant use of ioctl's, which
are a bad idea in the first place. Magic numbers are always bad, and are a
sign of bad design.
