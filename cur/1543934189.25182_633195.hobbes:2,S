First hibernation succeeds happily, but when I try to do it again after resuming, the machine hangs immediately after the familiar two pops from the speakers."Hanging" in this case means that none of the usual keys work (e.g. Caps Lock led doesn't toggle), but alt-sysrq-b does reboot the laptop.

They're using drivers/ide not libata. I don't think there have been any 
ACPI changes very recently in that code.
These lines seem suspicious that the drivers/ide code is doing something 
funny to the ACPI layer:
ACPI: Cannot set device to a higher-powered state than parent
