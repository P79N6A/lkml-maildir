Ok I just started noticing unusual things on my IDE DVD-RW as well, presumably 
related, on 2.6.13-rc6. Putting in a cd and trying to read it will cause huge 
delays and then error out with:
ide-cd: cmd 0x28 timed out
hdc: DMA timeout retry
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
then it will read fine. If I start another read it goes through the same 
cycle. Forcing dma *off* with hdparm fixes the problem and all subsequent 
accesses don't have this pause, however this was never an issue on previous 
kernels with dma working fine.
