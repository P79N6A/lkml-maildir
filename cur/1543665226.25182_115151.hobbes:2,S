That's a ridiculous comparison and it weakens your argument.  Leaving a
potential problem in place rather than fixing it as I did would be the
passive-aggressive approach, not the other way around.

Breaking the build is a low probability (many hundreds of fixes and one 
build break AFAIK) and low consequence failure (a build fix of that
nature is obvious and quickly and easily done).

The more persuasive argument against tree-wide fixes has been made by
Dave Jones, who has been slowed down by having to reconcile his external
patches with these changes.  For that reason, I've suggested that
maintainers use Dan Kegel's scripts to clean up their own areas when the
time is right for them.  But the maintainers have better things to do
with their time that this kind of low priority work. So chances are that
the spelling fix situation will go back into hibernation for another
release cycle, which I'm sure will make a lot of people happy.
