on a similar note and perhaps you might know more of the reason, I have two
Linksys cards, one cardbus one 16bit.  Neither of them will negotiate a link
with: 3com (everything), SynOptics (everything), D-Link (100base FE hub), and
some TrendNet hubs.
On some equipment I get a link light on the linksys and some I don't.  In all
cases, I never see a link indication on the other equipment.
Note, this is the pcmcia version of linksys stuff.  All PCI cards work fine.
I am willing to do some testing, but do keep in mind that I generally need to
reboot between card changes and that really bothers me because I can't do any
other work while I'm testing the pcmcia stuff.  The 16bit card uses the ne2k
driver, the cardbus uses the tulip driver (which doesn't work period in 2.3.99
now that it's the "tulip" and not the "tulip_cb" from pcmcia).
