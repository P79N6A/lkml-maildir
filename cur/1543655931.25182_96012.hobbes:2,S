     The RTO steps in only when there is a need to RETRANSMIT.
     For that reason, it makes no sense to place its start
     any shorter.
Actually, TCP_RTO_MIN cannot be made any smaller without
some serious thought.
The reason it is 200ms is due to the granularity of the BSD
TCP socket timers. 
In short, the repercussions are not exactly well known, so it's
a research problem to fiddle here.
