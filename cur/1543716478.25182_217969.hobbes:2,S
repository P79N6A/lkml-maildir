worker_thread examines kthread_should_stop() while its state
is TASK_RUNNING, after which it sets its state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.
If kthread_stop were to come after kthread_should_stop and before
worker_thread has set its state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE (which is possible
because of a CPU going dead), wouldn't kthread_stop block forever? 
Note that in case of CPU going dead, it is possible that a worker
thread bound to the dead cpu continues executing on a different cpu 
before it is killed in CPU_DEAD processing.
Am I missing something here?
