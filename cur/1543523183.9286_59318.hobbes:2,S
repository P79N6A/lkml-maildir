     The ASUS and FIC motherboards recognise EIDE disks properly even if
     the disks are /66 and the kernel isn't doing /66.   One of my K7s
     uses a FIC won'trecognisemyIBMkeyboard motherboard and one K7 I
     built for a client uses the ASUS one ; both of them are running with
     EIDE drives on Linux 2.0.28+logo (bog-standard in the IDE department
     except for the addition of a VIA ide dma driver) without any trouble
     seeing their boot devices.
