Olaf still performs security fixes on the userland NFS daemon, but you
should really be looking to 'knfsd' for the 2.2 kernels.

You should update the 'mount' utility. See the note about 'Util-linux'
in the file 'linux/Documentation/Changes'.

Please try to update the 'mount' utility, and then use something like
'mount -onolock server:/directory /mountpoint' since the userland NFS
does not support locking. If you still see the 'task xxx can't get a
request slot' message, please contact me directly via email as I am
the one responsible for the NFS changes in ac5.
