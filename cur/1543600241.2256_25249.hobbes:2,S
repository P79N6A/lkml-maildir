Bug reports when binary only modules have been loaded do not belong on
l-k, they have to go to the supplier.  AC wants to identify bug reports
that we can look at and ignore the ones that we cannot sensibly
investigate.  Any proprietary module loaded, at any time, means that
the bug report will almost certainly be ignored.
