Hello LKML readers,
I just came back from a 4-week vacation to find that I am now missing 
almost a weeks worth of lkml posts. - I am not really interested in 
everything but I am interested in the "*NTFS*" thread that has been going 
on while I was away.
If anyone has a copy of relevant posts between 15/8 and 21/8 please let me 
know of the URL if they are online or let me know you have them so I can 
ask you to kindly email them to me. - Please don't just email them to me 
since if several people decide to do that I might have a few upset 
email-sys-admins knocking on my door very quickly... /-;
Thanks in advance,
	Anton
