At least for prelink I'd also like to be able to atomically
read/modify/write a file, but the Solaris renameat doesn't allow that.
What I do is open the original file, read it etc., then create a temporary
file in the same dir and as the final step I need to rename it over
the original file, but I'd like to do that only if nobody replaced
the original file in the mean time.
So a renameat variant that would have
olddirfd, oldname, oldfd, newdirfd, newname, newfd
arguments would be handy.  It would do the same thing as
renameat (olddirfd, oldname, newdirfd, newname),
but would fail if oldfd resp. newfd no longer corresponds to
the olddirfd/oldname resp. newdirfd/newname files.
