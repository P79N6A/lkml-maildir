Hi Drago, Marty.

 >> What is net-pf-17?

For reference, here's the valies I've managed to identify...
 Q> Modprobe		Identifier	Possible Identifier
 Q> ~~~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Q> net-pf-1		unix
 Q> net-pf-2		ipv4
 Q> net-pf-3		ax25
 Q> net-pf-4		ipx
 Q> net-pf-5		appletalk
 Q> net_pf_6					netrom
 Q> net_pf_8					atmpvc
 Q> net_pf_9					x25
 Q> net_pf_10		ipv6
 Q> net_pf_11					rose
 Q> net_pf_12					decnet
 Q> net_pf_13					netbeui
 Q> net_pf_16					netlink
 Q> net-pf-17					packet
 Q> net_pf_18					ash
 Q> net_pf_19					econet
 Q> net_pf_20					atmsvc
 Q> net_pf_22					sna
 Q> net_pf_23					irda
The 'possible identifier' column is where I have identified the
protocol being referred to, but have no info as to the actual protocol
identifier to use. Basically, if you have the relevant protocol as a
module for your current kernel, look for a module with a name similar
to those given, probably to be found in...
	/lib/modules/`uname -r`/net/
Best wishes from Riley.
