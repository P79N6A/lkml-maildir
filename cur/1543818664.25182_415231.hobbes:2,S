I still have'nt found a good way to do so, even after discussing with Nick and Hugh, but that's exactly where I intend to get for the xip stuff.
Today, the _only_ code that uses the struct page behind those DCSS segments is aops->nopage (as return value) and do_wp_page. Those small servers have almost no local memory (kernel, libraries, and binaries are shared), and the mem_map array is a large overhead.

That's true. One can store that information in the vma flags, and split the vma into 3 vmas once we have a write fault. Although that would work in theory, I doubt it would save lot of memory because of too many vmas, and I think we would burn precious CPU horsepower walking all those vmas.
I believe Hugh has already done an implementation for that which he does not consider nice. I have not found a feasible way to adress that issue so far, and I promise to keep from coding until I find a reasonable non-intrusive way to get there.
