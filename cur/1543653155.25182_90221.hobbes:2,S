I encountered similar phenomena with usb-storage.
I think the proper solution is to never automatically
scan for a partition table.
We perhaps need to do that at boot time, but in all other
cases user space can ask the kernel to read a partition table.
For usb-storage things work fairly well (for some kernels)
using
	blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdx
