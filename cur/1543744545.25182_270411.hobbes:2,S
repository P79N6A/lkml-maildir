Yes, in fact I guess that the problem is for any _thread variable. And as 
fork() is not a raw syscall, so clone() shouldn't be.
I'll file a bugreport when I have time to do it properly - I don't want to 
hear that "if I go into dirty things using clone(), I get to keep the pieces 
and setup a different TLS for the new process"
