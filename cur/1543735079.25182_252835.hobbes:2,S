Part of this is about how to talk to business people.... marketing.
The typical definition of TOE is "offload 90+% of the net stack", as 
opposed to "TCP assist", which is stuff like TSO.
If people ask about how to support TOE in Linux, you can say "sure, we 
_already_ support TOE, just stick Linux on a PCI card" rather than "no 
we don't support it."
And wha-la, we support TOE with zero code changes ;-)
	Jeff, who would love to have a bunch of Athlons
	on PCI cards to play with.
