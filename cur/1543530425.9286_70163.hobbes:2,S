The raw IO code in 2.3 allows you to do dma from user buffers to any
block device.

This only applies to ISA devices.  PCI devices can access all of memory
(although the driver needs to support dual address cycles or PCI64 to
access memory above 4GB).

Only ISA, again.

The question was not about doing it from user mode.  It was about
accessing user space from a kernel-mode driver.
