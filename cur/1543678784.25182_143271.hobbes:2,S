Not necessarily, e.g. changing
#define AUDIO_SET_ATTRIBUTES       _IOW('o', 17, audio_attributes_t)
#define AUDIO_SET_KARAOKE          _IOW('o', 18, audio_karaoke_t)

#define AUDIO_SET_KARAOKE          _IOW('o', 48, audio_karaoke_t)
or
typedef struct dvb_frontend_parameters {
        uint32_t frequency;       /* (absolute) frequency in Hz for QAM/OFDM */
                                  /* intermediate frequency in kHz for QPSK */

won't change anything for user space apps. (We are only talking about
self compiled ones here anyway, otherwise you won't need the headers.)

Anyway, even in user/include it should be under linux/dvb because
that's just what it is Linux DVB. So the app has to include
<linux/dvb/xxx.h>. 
I don't care what distributions do. When I get a new kernel (no
packages), I use the includes from that kernel and compile my apps
with that. Distribution users won't compile anyway and if they do they
probably need to get a kernel.org kernel.
