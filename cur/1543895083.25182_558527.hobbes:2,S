I resigned as Chief Scientist of Solera Networks May 8 this year -- 
mostly because I was not allowed to have any freedom, including working on
free Linux projects. This went on for almost 4 years (since 2003). Now 
that I am independent again, I can work on stuff like this again. I 
started a new company with John Noorda (Ray Noorda's oldest son) who 
runs Canopy now. That's my current status. I am an owner and entrepeneur 
again. So I have a lot of free time and will from now on.
