Thank you Dick
Oops, I use a wrong subject, what I want to ask is how the pg0 be initialized
in head.S,
395 .org 0x2000
396 ENTRY(pg0)
so $pg0-__PAGE_OFFSET = 0x2000 - 0xC0000000 = 40002000, how comes bff00000 ?
>84 movl $pg0-_PAGE_OFFSET,%edi
%edi = bff00000 (or 40002000) ?
>87 2:      stosl
that's  move %eax  to  %es:%edi, __KERNEL_DS = 0x18, so %es is 0x18, according the gdt_table, 0x00cf92000000ffff, the base linear address is 0x00000000, that means
%es:%edi = bff00000 (or 40002000), how can the %eax be moved into an nonexist ram, 
cause at that time, no page directory and and page table yet.
Anyway, thank you for your help.
Regards,
Jason
