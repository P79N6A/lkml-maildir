clocksource=tsc?
I suspect you're forcing the clocksource as its not selected by
default. Could you provide dmesg output without that option. It might
shed some light as to why the clocksource isn't chosen.
It may very well be your TSCs are not synched or are otherwise not
reliable for timekeeping , and thus time is not consistent between
cpus.

PS: also, you might want to check that acpc=noirq bit as well.. i
think you mean "acpi=noirq"
