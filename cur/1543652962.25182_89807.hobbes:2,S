Hi,
	Anything that can help with source level debugging of custom drivers
would be great for bringing up new hardware.   
One of my frustrations with debugging a driver on a StrongARM based platform
has been that I don't know of a way to step through the code other than a
post-mortem review of the printk's.
	An ethernet interface would be great, like the existing gdb
interface for cross-platform development.
Edwin Bland,

Well, apart from the fact that a lot of machines don't even _have_
serial ports..
I dunno. I might even be willing to apply kgdb patches to my tree if it
just could use the regular network card I already have connected on all
my machines. None of my laptops have a serial line, for example, but
they all have networking.
Soon even _desktops_ probably won't have serial lines any more, only USB.
