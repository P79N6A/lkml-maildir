Hi!
I would like some help concerning a broken md0 booting configuration,
where I have no clue what can be wrong...
What have happened is that I have put two out of the three disks of the
RAID1 array on an UDMA66 add-on card, which the standard linux kernel does
not recognizes w/o Andre's patches. Once I had to boot the stock kernel
and modify /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit (add hdparm -d0 /dev/hd[aeg]). During this
the kernel had seen, that I have a mirror set with only one drive of the
four in the system. Unfortunatelly, then I issued a lilo command, and
since that lilo is not agreeing with my raid1 md0. At first it just did
not know what to do with the device (md0). This might be ok because two
disks to write to were missing.
But when I booted an ide patched kernel, and ran lilo again, and here
comes the strangest thing: it did its work, but not for all the three
drives, az previously, but only for the middle one (e out of hd[aeg]).
Since then I am running the box with a and e swapped, so it boots, and the
arrays still autorun fine, but cannot get lilo write its stuff on the e
and g drives.
What might be the resolution for this problem?
/proc/mdstat seems ok to me...
