I don't mean drivers or any other part of the kernel.
I mean third-party code written to run in kernel space, in C++.
It's possible to make much use of C++ in this area.
You might not like to use it, but that's not a good reason to prevent it.
If significant support was required I would suggest forgetting the idea.
But I believe the changes are minor, easily understood cleanups, so I
see no reason to rule it out.
