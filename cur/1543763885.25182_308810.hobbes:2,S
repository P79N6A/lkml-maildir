How about adding a
 if(rt_task(current)) {
        WARN_ON(1);
        mutex_setprio(current, MAX_PRIO-1)
 }
?
to find all calls to yields from rt-tasks. That will force the user (aka
the real-time developer) to either stop calling the subsystems still using
yield from his RT-tasks, or fix those subsystems.
