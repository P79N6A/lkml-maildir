This card seems to be based on the National Semiconductors DP83820,
for which there is an in-kernel driver.  Note that US$36 only gets you
the 32-bit/33MHz PCI version (AEG-320T); the 64-bit version (AEG-620T)
goes for about twice as much (according to google).
There is also the D-Link DGE-550T, a 64-bit/66MHz card starting at
US$80 (according to pricewatch).  It apparently uses a different
in-kernel driver, dl2k.o.
So does anyone have any comments on the stability and performance of
these cards/drivers?
Cheers,
Wayne
