I didn't mean to insult you, Ingo.  
I have nothing but praise for what you've accomplished with 2.6.10.
My tests yesterday demonstrated slightly better SCHED_FIFO performance
with 2.6.10 than 2.4.19 with Andrew's low-latency patches.  For a
mainstream kernel that is a huge accomplishment, never before
achieved.  We should celebrate.
I was just pointing out that saying nice(-20) works as well as
SCHED_ISO, though true, doesn't mean much since neither of them
(currently) work well enough to be useful.

Which of the the POSIX 1-99 range do you map into those three
priorities?  (I can't figure it out from the patch.)
How does one go about deciding which priority differences "matter" and
which do not?  Why not honor the realtime programmer's choice of
priorities?
For good reasons, most audio developers prefer the POSIX realtime
interfaces.  They are far from perfect, but remain the only workable,
portable solution available.  That is why I like your rt_cpu_limit
proposal so much better that this one.
