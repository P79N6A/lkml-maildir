I'd recommend using fixed denominator rational numbers to represent real 
numbers and polynomial approximations for the transcendental functions. 
  We do this in our EBS scheduler patches and it seems to be successful. 
  The main downside to this approach is the limited range (and 
precision) of values that can be represented so you need to have a clear 
idea of the likely values at various stages of your calculations.
The "Handbook of Mathematical Functions" by Abramowitz and Stegun, Dover 
Publications, New York ISBN 486-61272-4 (LCN 65-12253) is a good source 
of methods for approximating functions.
If you'd like more detailed assistance don't hesitate to ask.
Peter
