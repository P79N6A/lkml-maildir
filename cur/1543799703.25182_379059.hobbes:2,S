Good catch. Btw, should we perhaps disallow (or at least WARN_ON()) 
pci_map_single() with a length of zero? I think it's always likely a bug..
However, that
	"skb->end - skb->data"
calculation is a bit strange. It correctly maps the whole skb, but 
wouldn't it make more sense to use the length we actually tell the card to 
use? 
In other words, wouldn't it be a whole lot more sensible and logical to 
use
	np->rx_buf_sz
instead? That's the value we use for allocation and that's the size we 
tell the card we have.
Of course, on the alloc path, it seems to add an additional 
"NV_RX_ALLOC_PAD" thing, so maybe the "end-data" thing makes sense.
