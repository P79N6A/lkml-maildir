Hi, I just got an IBM ThinkPad T42 (model 2378FVU) with
Centrino/Pentium M 735 and a Radeon 9600.  I'm running 2.6.9-rc3 (with
ipw2200 0.9 wireless drivers) and I've experienced several hard
lockups over the past few days.
The system seems to be completely unresponsive to keyboard and
network, and even "nmi_watchdog=2" didn't produce anything.  I'm not
sure what triggers the lockup -- I've had them happen while the system
was idle running an X screensaver, and also while I've been on the
console (non-X) doing nothing but typing through an ssh connection. 
Generally it takes a couple of hours for the lockup to happen.
Has anyone seen anything similar?  Any ideas on how to go about debugging this?
I'm including my modules and /proc/interrupts, and my .config is attached.
Thanks,
  Roland
