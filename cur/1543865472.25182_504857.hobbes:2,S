I came into this discussion late as I only read LKML in summary form, but I feel I need to address
several misconceptions here.

As Michael Buesch has explained, bcm43xx only changes the eeprom under very controlled circumstances
that never happen accidentally. It is much more likely that your Windows driver uses V4 firmware,
whereas bcm43xx uses V3. Without a power-off step to erase the firmware the results are likely to be
indeterminate.

It is _NOT_ true that bcm43xx only works with 802.11b. My AP is set in 802.11g-only mode and I have
been using bcm43xx with it for nearly a year. What is true is that none of the OFDM rates work
because of some unknown bug, probably in initialization. As a result, we are limited to a maximum
data rate of 11Mbs, but it is still running in 802.11g mode!

I certainly would hope for a even a little cooperation from Broadcom; however, it is not easy to
avoid getting their hardware, particularly with laptops. When I recently upgraded, my primary aims
were (1) a 14 inch screen  as the native resolution of a larger one makes things too small for my
eyes and reduced resolution looks crappy on an LCD, and (2) an AMD 64 X2 processor to run an x86_64
OS. The kind of wireless card contained within was not an issue, although the BCM4311 that I got
turned out to be a benefit as I became the first developer with the hardware needed to find and fix
two major outstanding bugs.
While I'm on my soapbox, I want to thank the group that reverse-engineered the Broadcom chips and
the group that did the early coding on the driver. Although the current driver still has its faults,
the fact that there is a working driver that doesn't hang or crash an SMP version of Linux and
offers usable wireless service for such a complicated piece of totally undocumented hardware is a
real tribute to those two groups. Thanks guys.
