My gut feeling is if linux aligns or pads things nicely for any reason,
then the bye enables don't get used or clobber padding.

yup.

No problem. My take is, if it hasn't caused a problem on x86 because
things are well aligned, then no reason to change the code.
Knowing the issues about other RISC archs 
Maybe keep a shorter note about the bit changed meaning in later models
just to document the issues.
