	I clearly explained what I meant in context that you snipped. In summary, I
mean 'allowed' in the sense that it's not prohibited by the standard and
arguing that it's not allowed leads to direct logical contradictions.
Nothing prohibits an implementation from dropping a UDP packet after it has
been received. Nothing in POSIX requires that a subsequent operation
actually does not block.
	Would you argue that an implementation cannot drop a UDP packet after it
has indicated a read hit on 'select' because of that packet? If so, where
does POSIX say this? And if not, then it can drop a corrupt packet on a call
to 'recvmsg' as well.
