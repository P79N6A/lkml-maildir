I have two ide-controllers, one onboard (VIA vt8233a) and one as pci-card 
(Promise ultra100 tx2). The following drives are attached:
Controller1:
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc ibm harddisk (hda)
/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0/cd ide cd-writer
/dev/ide/host0/bus1/target1/lun0/cd ide dvd-rom
Controller2:
/dev/ide/host2/bus1/target0/lun0/disc maxtor harddisk (hde)
/dev/ide/host2/bus1/target1/lun0/disc maxtor harddisk (hdg)
The system (debian unstable) boots from an raid0 on hde/hdg. hda can be 
accesed by parted,fdsik etc., partitions and filesystems can be created. But 
when i try to mount any partiton on hda i get:
mount: /dev/hda2 already mounted or /mnt/hda2/ busy
which it isn`t (cat /proc/mounts). All partitions can be mounted under 2.4 
kernels.
Is it now necessary to use kernel option "Boot off-board chipsets first 
support" for this kind of setup?
Bye, Matthias
