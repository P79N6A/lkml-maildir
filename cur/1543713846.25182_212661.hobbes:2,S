I think there are some design issues that still aren't resolved - we've
been over this a bit before, but I still don't think they're fixed.
It seems you're still making a copy of the binding structure for every
VMA, which seems ... extravagent. Can we share them? IIRC, the only 
justification was the striping ... and I thought we agreed that was
better fixed by using the mod of the offset as a decider?
Maybe I'm just misreading your code, in which case, feel free to spit at me ;-)
