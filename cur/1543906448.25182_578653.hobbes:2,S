Hrm, what is wrong with :
trace_mark(ds_myevent, "%d %zu %p", arg1, arg2, arg3);
then ?
You could then attach your probe to all markers staring with a ds_
prefix. (we should keep a list of the used prefixes somewhere) You could
match with format strings to figure out which callback should be
connected to which marker (if you don't plan to have your callback
parsing the format string dynamically).

I wonder how you do your locking there ? I guess you are writing data
that *should* reside on the stack into the private data, which is
somewhat static. A solution to this that would be both not too intrusive
for kernel code and fast enough would be to keep a buffer of such
saved/read data, indexed with a cookie that would be passed from _start
to _end. The only issue is that this cookie would have to be placed on
the kernel stack, its space being reserved even when markers are
disabled.

if you differentiate them with names like:
ds_point_start and ds_point_end
and pass the cookie as write parameter to _start and read parameter to
_end:
void somefct()
{
  long cookie;
  trace_mark(ds_point_start, "%p %d %zu %p", &cookie, arg1, arg2, arg3);
  ...
  trace_mark(ds_point_end, "%lu %d %zu %p", cookie, arg1, arg2, arg3);
}
It should do the job ?
(note: if mutual exclusion access to a static variable is insured by
proper locking in the kernel, then you don't need to do such trick)

Hrm, the ideal thing would be to agree on an instrumentation set for a
given subsystem/driver and to get the said instrumentation integrated in
mainline. That would sound like a better way to stop reinventing the
wheel forever. And actually, if there are some features in your tracer
that you would like to add into a mainline tracer, I'll be glad to
discuss those with you. A lot of people out there are facing the same
issues as you are anyway :)
Ideally, a marker should express what the kernel code is doing and what
information we want to extract from it more than being tied to one
particular consumer (probe).

It sure helps, thanks :)
