Ok, it's normal that the Beige G3 doesn't do NAP, and the 7455 cannot do
DOZE, so I suspect it's all normal and my patch fixes it.
However, the eMac should have been doing NAP. Can you check what's up in
arch/ppc/plaform/pmac_feature.c with powersave_nap ? is it set at all ?
It should be visible from userland at /proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap
and should be set to 1 by default on your machine... unless your cpu
node in the device-tree has the "flush-on-lock" property...
Ben.
