i've applied them to tip/tracing/ftrace, with some small changes:
 12ef7d4: ftrace: CPU buffer start annotation clean ups
 ee6bce5: ftrace: rename iter_ctrl to trace_options
 1696b2b: ftrace: show buffer size in kilobytes
 a94c80e: ftrace: rename trace_entries to buffer_size_kb
as per Arjan's suggestion i changed buffer_size to buffer_size_kb - 
and also removed the kilobytes string from its output.
thanks Steve!
