see how readable and easily understandable the code is?
it takes me several hours to read OpenVZ code, and that's
not just me :)

you forgot efficient and performant here ...

simply doesn't work? 
because you didn't try to make it work?
because you didn't succeed in making it work?

as we are discussing RSS limits, there are actually
three different (existing) approaches we have talked
about:
 - 'the 'perfect RAM counter'
   each page is accounted exactly once, when used in
   a guest, regardless of how many times it is shared
   between different guest tasks
 - the 'RSS sum' approach
   each page is accounted for every task mapping it
   (will account shared pages inside a guest several
   times and doesn't reflect the actual RAM usage)
 - the 'first user owns' approach
   each page, when mapped the first time, gets accounted
   to the guest who mapped it, regardless of the fact
   that it might be shared with other guests lateron
the first one is 'perfect' IMHO, while all three are
'consistant' if done properly, although they will show
quite different results and require different limit
settings ...

good, but what you currently do is providing 'your'
implementation with 'your' design and approach, which
_doesn't_ really suit _my_ needs ...

yes, tons of locking, complicated indirections and
a lot of (partially hard to understand) code ...
