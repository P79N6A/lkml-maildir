The 2.4.16 kernel finally makes my clients happy with memory
management.  The systems that froz up is a Dell of some sort or other
with two 1Ghz Pentium IIIs and 4G of memory.  But, now I seems to be
having ethernet problems.  With and eepro100 card:
  Bus  0, device   4, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 8).
      IRQ 16.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfeb02000 [0xfeb02fff].
      I/O at 0xfcc0 [0xfcff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xfe900000 [0xfe9fffff].
loaded as a module, being used heavily, the system froze with nothing
on the console when I saw it.  Normal log messages until:
Nov 28 22:03:31 ps1 kernel: eth0: can't fill rx buffer (force 0)!
Nov 28 22:05:03 ps1 kernel: 0001.

Then me hitting the reset key before 10am.  I'm going to start digging
through the code (guess it will be more of a learning experience for
me rather then actually being able to help code).  So any suggestions
will be helpful.
