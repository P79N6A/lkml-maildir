Hmmm...  It's not so much of a back port as it is the implementation of the interface on x86 boxes.  In fact, the EFI sample implementation can be used on boxes with legacy BIOSes and the interface is consistent with what is currently shipped on ia64 platforms.  The intention is to have an interface to the firmware that is portable and consistent.  For example, much of the linux loader is shared between ia64 and x86.  Assuming add-in cards have EFI compliant drivers, this also makes option ROM and even system BIOS upgrades easy with EFI utilities and without the need for DOS.

If one can obtain the required system configuration information from EFI before booting the kernel and pass this information to the kernel so as to enable kernel initialization, then why else might we even need the 16 bit BIOS calls in setup.S that essentially perform the same function?  I'm curious why it wouldn't be better to enter the kernel in 32 bit, protected mode?
thanks,
