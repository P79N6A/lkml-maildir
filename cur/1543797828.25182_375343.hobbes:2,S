Its almost the 0% solution. The kernel as shipped doesn't seem to have
any clashing symbols like this. The two sets of cases people report are 
1. Out of tree modules
2. Reconfiguring, rebuilding something from kernel to module and not
cleaning up
A dep time solution might fix one of those but robustness here would be
good, especially as once the installation is incorrect end users can
often trigger hotplug loads that cause problems.
