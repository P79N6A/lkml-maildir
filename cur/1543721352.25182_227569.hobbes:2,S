I'm going to remove this warning from sparse. Apparently it is valid C99, 
and somebody (I think Richard Henderson) made the excellent point that it 
allows for type-independent code where you do something like
	mytype myfunc1(xxx);
	mytype myfunc2(xxx)
	{
		...
		return myfunc1(...);
	}
and it just works regardless of what type it is. 
sparse will obviously warn about expressions with non-void types being 
returned from a void function, but the case where the expression exists 
and has the right type should be ok.
I'm not sure it's wonderful C in general, but I certainly can't claim it 
is actively offensive, and since gcc accepts it and we have these things 
in the kernel, why complain?
