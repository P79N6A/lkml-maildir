Subject: some remaining section mismatches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

1.  I don't understand this one.  Can you look at it?
WARNING: drivers/video/macmodes.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:mac_find_mode from __ksymtab between '__ksymtab_mac_find_mode' (at offset 0x0) and '__ksymtab_mac_map_monitor_sense'
2.  This is requires either a whitelist addition or a change to the
struct name in the driver:
WARNING: drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mbox.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:megaraid_probe_one from .data between 'megaraid_pci_driver_g' (at offset 0x2e0) and 'megaraid_mbox_version'
3.  drivers/char/tpm_infineon.c:
WARNING: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:tpm_inf_pnp_probe from .data between 'tpm_inf_pnp' (at offset 0x18) and 'tpm_inf'
WARNING: drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.o - Section mismatch: reference to .exit.text:tpm_inf_pnp_remove from .data between 'tpm_inf_pnp' (at offset 0x20) and 'tpm_inf'
I don't see a problem here, the driver just isn't using the whitelisted
struct name(s).
4.  drivers/rtc/: rtc-sysfs.c and rtc-test.c:
WARNING: drivers/rtc/rtc-sysfs.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:rtc_sysfs_add_device from .data between 'rtc_sysfs_interface' (at offset 0x18) and 'rtc_attr_group'
This could be OK, hopefully someone can say yes/no.
WARNING: drivers/rtc/rtc-test.o - Section mismatch: reference to .exit.text:test_remove from .data between 'test_drv' (at offset 0x8) and 'dev_attr_irq'
Looks OK, struct name is just not in the whitelist.
Changing the struct name removes the warning.
