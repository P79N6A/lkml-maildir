	Fixing the symptomes never does anything good. Either it's
a bad RAM and then nothing will help, or we have a f_count leak
somewhere, and we'ld better find the reason instead of masking
the result. Actually we'ld better remove all dead tests - that way we'll
have better chances to catch the sucker.

	Nope, just that something called fput() on the file in question
when it shouldn't.

	Traces of hunting for similar bugs.
What .config do you have? What kind of stuff ran on the box when (and
before) it happened?
