Hi Pavel !
Please kill that swsusp_restore() call that itself calls
flush_tlb_global(), it's junk. First, the flush_tlb_global() thing is
arch specific, and that's all swsusp_restore() does. Then, the asm just
calls this before returning to C code, so it makes no sense to have a
hook there. The x86 asm can have it's own call to some arch stuff if it
wants or just do the tlb flush in asm...
Ben.
