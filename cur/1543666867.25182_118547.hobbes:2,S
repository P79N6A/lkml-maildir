OK, there seems to be enough resistance to this to put it off for a year
or two.  Since that means I don't have to do any work, that plan has
inherent appeal to me.
In other words, the current setup will remain for now.  HOWEVER, I would
like to recommend that mirror sites start carrying .bz2 files if they
want to carry only one format.
