Actually, a quick look at the source code reveals that we do get -ENODEV
if there's no driver, and -ENXIO if there's a driver but the requested
minor doesn't exist (actually, ide.c returns -ENXIO if there's no device
specific driver (ide-disk, ide-cd, etc.), but it does print a message).
So we could either check for those two separately, or just print the error
number (I'm assuming / hoping we don't have an errno table in the kernel :-).
