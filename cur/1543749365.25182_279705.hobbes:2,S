Subject: [PATCH 2.6.10-rc3-mm1] m32r: PAGE_NONE support (0/3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
This patchset updates page flags for m32r.
* Support PAGE_NONE
  - Support PAGE_NONE attribute for memory protection.
  - Add _PAGE_PROTNONE bit to pte.
    On the m32r, the _PAGE_PROTNONE bit is a software bit.
* Remove PAGE_USER
  - Remove _PAGE_USER bit from pte, because the m32r doesn't support it 
    by hardware. (cf. mips)
In my understanding, the _PAGE_PRONONE bit is used to show explicitly that
no physical memory is mapped and the mapped page is not accessible, right?
If a page marked with PAGE_NONE is accessed, an access error should
be happened.
Tested on M3T-M32700UT and M3A-ZA36 eva boards, and it looks working.
Please apply.
Thank you.
