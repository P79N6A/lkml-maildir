Could you please use adjectives, like "some" or "all" before
"Device writers"?  Could you also use a qualifier like, "excluding me",
etc.  Thanks.

For the 3-second "off-the-cuff example" see how the "smp_portal" sysfs
binary attribute works in drivers/scsi/sas/sas_expander.c at the bottom
of the file, whereby user space first writes and then reads as much data
it is expecting.
(Thus there is _no_ hardcoding of the amount of data SMP request can
return (as is done in SDI).)
Here are the tiny functions for refresh:
/* ---------- SMP portal ---------- */
static ssize_t smp_portal_write(struct kobject *kobj, char *buf, loff_t offs,
				size_t size)
{
	struct domain_device *dev = to_dom_device(kobj);
	struct expander_device *ex = &dev->ex_dev;
	if (offs != 0)
		return -EFBIG;
	else if (size == 0)
		return 0;
	down_interruptible(&ex->smp_sema);
	if (ex->smp_req)
		kfree(ex->smp_req);
	ex->smp_req = kzalloc(size, GFP_USER);
	if (!ex->smp_req) {
		up(&ex->smp_sema);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
	memcpy(ex->smp_req, buf, size);
	ex->smp_req_size = size;
	ex->smp_portal_pid = current->pid;
	up(&ex->smp_sema);
	return size;
}
static ssize_t smp_portal_read(struct kobject *kobj, char *buf, loff_t offs,
			       size_t size)
{
	struct domain_device *dev = to_dom_device(kobj);
	struct expander_device *ex = &dev->ex_dev;
	u8 *smp_resp;
	int res = -EINVAL;
	down_interruptible(&ex->smp_sema);
	if (!ex->smp_req || ex->smp_portal_pid != current->pid ||
	    offs != ex->smp_req_size)
		goto out;
	res = 0;
	if (size == 0)
		goto out;
	res = -ENOMEM;
	smp_resp = alloc_smp_resp(size);
	if (!smp_resp)
		goto out;
	res = smp_execute_task(dev, ex->smp_req, ex->smp_req_size,
			       smp_resp, size);
	if (!res) {
		memcpy(buf, smp_resp, size);
		res = size;
	}
	kfree(smp_resp);
out:
	kfree(ex->smp_req);
	ex->smp_req = NULL;
	ex->smp_req_size = 0;
	ex->smp_portal_pid = -1;
	up(&ex->smp_sema);
	return res;
}

Indeed, sysfs _is_ very flexible, and with a single process open(2) it could
satisfy the transaction needed functionality.
