The only way to use the PATA ports is to use a driver from Promise. 
libata doesn't support PDC203xx PATA ports at all, regardless of 
configuration.
Technically speaking, libata needs to be modified to support two 
different types of "host operations".  Once that internal limitation is 
removed, adding support for the PATA ports is easy.
