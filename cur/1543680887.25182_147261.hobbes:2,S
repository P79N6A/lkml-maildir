# define do_div(n,base) ({                              \
        uint32_t __base = (base);                       \
        uint32_t __rem;                                 \
        if (likely(((n) >> 32) == 0)) {                 \
so if we call do_div() on a u32, the compiler emits nasal daemons.
and we do this -- in the antcipatory scheduler:
                if (aic->seek_samples) {
                        aic->seek_mean = aic->seek_total + 128;
                        do_div(aic->seek_mean, aic->seek_samples);
                }
seek_mean is a sector_t so sometimes it's 64-bit on a 32-bit platform.
so we can't avoid calling do_div().
This almost works (the warning is harmless since gcc optimises away the call)
# define do_div(n,base) ({                                              \
        uint32_t __base = (base);                                       \
        uint32_t __rem;                                                 \
        if ((sizeof(n) < 8) || (likely(((n) >> 32) == 0))) {            \
                __rem = (uint32_t)(n) % __base;                         \
                (n) = (uint32_t)(n) / __base;                           \
        } else                                                          \
                __rem = __div64_32(&(n), __base);                       \
        __rem;                                                          \
 })
Better ideas?
