Subject: [2.6 patch] no longer mark MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS as BROKEN and remove broken MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS shouldn't be marked as BROKEN.
This patch brings the MTD_SHARP driver back into life and removes the 
non-compiling MTD_AMDSTD and MTD_JEDEC with everything depending on 
them.
