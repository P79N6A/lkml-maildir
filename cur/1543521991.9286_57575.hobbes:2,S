Actually, I was referring to the whole general scheme, and the correct 
comment should have been "what is so difficult to understand about `(not a) 
leap year'?".  Point being that it's not necessary to envision double leap 
years, etc. when no such are ever mentioned.
I'm really starting to wonder about people's ability to read for 
comprehension.
