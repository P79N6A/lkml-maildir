you should take another look. The crutial difference is that AFAICS 
lrtbf is using interrupts on _both_ the logger and the target side.  
lpptest only uses interrupts on the target side (that is what we are 
measuring), but uses polling _with all interrupts disabled_ on the 
logger side. This makes things much more reliable, as it's not some 
complex mix of two worst-case latencies, but a small constant overhead 
on the logger side and the worst-case latency on the target side. This 
also means i can run whatever lpptest version on the logger side, i dont 
have to worry about its latencies because there are none that are 
variable.

logger-side overhead does not matter at all, and the 8 bytes copy is not 
measured in the overhead. (it is also insignificant.)

well, LPPTEST works just fine with the i8259A PIC too. (which is much 
more common in embedded setups than IO-APICs)
