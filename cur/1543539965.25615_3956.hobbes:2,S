Alright, well hows this: The info struct won't have a pgrp or
session set until after an open has completed (they are set right at the end
of rs_open, and info is memset to zero by get_async_struct).
So on line 1316, if you do:
1316c1316
<               if (retval) {
---
>               if (retval && !info->session) {
1324a1325,1326
>               else if (retval)
>                   goto errout;
That should fix the problem of not being able to open the device, right?
It still won't handle your second point, but I'm thinking maybe the user
should recieve some notification right away when they try to set the device to
an in use IRQ, rather than when try to use the port.  
Sorry for all the trouble about this small point, but it just irked me if 
setserial allows me to set serial port is on IRQ 1 or whatever with no error 
messages until I try to use the port. Oh well, I see the wisdom in your method
now. Whatever you want to do is fine.

Alright, it looks like I'm just going to have to chalk this one up to me being
an idiot again. I can reproduce what I'm talking about only with my driver
now, so I'm guessing all along it must have been something I introduced with
the auto_irq flag. The way it happens (with my driver) is to 
setserial /dev/ttyS0 irq 0
setserial /dev/ttyS0 autoconfig auto_irq
Oh well, 2 out of 4 ain't bad. ;)
