/proc is usually a very nice interface that's both human- and machine-readable.
Some changes have gone in though (such as /proc/mdstat) that makes the proc
files implement something more like a pretty-printing user interface with
text-mode progress bars and what not.  That's a PITA to parse.
Now, if established files in proc could just be stable, so that they would not
change unless non-backwards-compatible information absolutely must be
presented, that would be a major step in the right direction.  Further, if we
could find some acceptable compromise between human- and machine- readability,
as has happened in the past...
Then, someone might just implement the equivalent of kstat (from Solaris) or
pstat (from HP-UX).   Under a license so that commercial players could actually
link to the library as well (unlike the gproc library).
So call me a dreamer   ;)
(For the record, it's not unlikely that I would be able to dedicate some
 time to that effort in a not too distant future - say, 2.5 ?)
