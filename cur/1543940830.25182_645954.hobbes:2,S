If you go to 
http://www.gpl-violations.org
 you'll see that Harald has 
also successfully enforced his rights under the terms of the GPL as one 
of the copyright holders of the Linux kernel in many more cases without 
having to go to (German) courts.
There were people who were claiming the GPL was not enforcible at court, 
and there are many grey areas of the GPL left where people claim this 
and that - and only court decisions will bring clarifications.
