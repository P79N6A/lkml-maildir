It can be a problem: there are cases where a `raw' version of a
function is required (usually __xxx) which doesn't grab the lock.
However, if your calls are so convoluted that you don't realize that a
public lock will be grabbed, you've got more subtle deadlock problems
with grabbing locks out of order, which can't be hacked around by
making locks recursive.
My 2c,
Rusty.
