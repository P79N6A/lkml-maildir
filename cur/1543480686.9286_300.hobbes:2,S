The issue is too tenuous.  This won't do it for clueless people ("will
SqlServer still run properly under FrontPage?") -- I'd be tempted
to assume that people either know what NTFS is and can sort out the
implications for themselves, or they don't, and would need to hire someone
["there goes the cost savings"] to get any benefit out of linux.
