Hi.  I am newbie at GNU/linux.
I am trying to build a kernel (2.6.12)  for a powerpc target using cygwin on 
my i686 machine.  I have
Windows 2000 as my operating system.
I have recent versions of cygwin (with GNU make 3.80), binutils for the 
powerpc (gcc v 3.3.1, ld v 2.14)
I set
ARCH=ppc
CROSS_COMPILE= powerpc-ibm-eabi-
and I add the cross compiler/build directory to my path.
After untaring the kernel, I issue the
make mrproper, which appears to work.
Then I issue
make menuconfig
and I get the following error, which I can't seem to get around:
HOSTCC   scripts/basic/fixdep
fixdep: no such file or directory
make[1]:*** [scripts/basic/fixdep] Error 2
make[1] Leaving directory /cygdrive/c/Linux_amcc/linux-2.6.12
Can you suggest what the problem might be?  Should I be able to build the 
kernel
with cygwin?
