No.  The IBM hashed page tables are not page tables at all, they are
really just a bigger 16-way set-associative in-memory TLB. 
You can't actually sanely keep track of VM layout in them.
Those POWER4 machines are wonderful things, but they have a few quirks:
 - it's so expensive that anybody who is slightly price-conscious gets a
   farm of PC's instead. Oh, well.
 - the CPU module alone is something like .5 kilowatts (translation:
   don't expect it in a nice desktop factor, even if you could afford
   it). 
 - IBM nomenclature really is broken. They call disks DASD devices, and
   they call their hash table a page table, and they just confuse
   themselves and everybody else for no good reason.  They number bits
   the wrong way around, for example (and big-endian bitordering really
   _is_ clearly inferior to little-endian, unlike byte-ordering.  Watch
   the _same_ bits in the _same_ register change name in the 32 vs
   64-bit architecture manuals, and puke)
But with all their faults, they do have this really studly setup with 8
big, fast CPU's on a single module. A few of those modules and you get
some ass-kick performance numbers. As you can see.
