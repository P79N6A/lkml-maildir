Its no less fair this way, tasks will still be woken in fifo
order. They will just be given the chance to submit a batch
of requests.
I think the cpu utilization gain of waking a number of tasks
at once would be outweighed by advantage of waking 1 task
and not putting it to sleep again for a number of requests.
You obviously are not claiming concurrency improvements, as
your method would also increase contention on the io lock
(or the queue lock in 2.5).
Then you have the cache gains of running each task for a
longer period of time. You also get possible IO scheduling
improvements.
Consider 8 requests, batch_requests at 4, 10 tasks writing
to different areas of disk.
Your method still only allows each task to have 1 request in
the elevator at once. Mine allows each to have a run of 4
requests in the elevator.
