Not really. We do a passable job. Stuff gets dropped, lost, 
deferred and forgotten, applied when it conflicts with other work
- much of this stuff that software wouldnt actually improve on over a 
person

That wont help you - most discussion occurs in private because l/k 
is too noisy and many key people dont read it.

Rubbish. Ask the engineering world about fault tracking. You won't get
"different products no central flaw tracking" you'll get extensive cross
correlation, statistical tools and the like in any syste, where reliability
matters
Many kernel bug reports end up invisible to some of the developers.
