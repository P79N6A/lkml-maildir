Well, i've said already about roots in post above.
This fix is for needless mktemp and old binutils.
Fix for roots:
,--
|if [ `id -u` == "0" ]; then echo "Root landed !!!"; ! true; fi
`--
More polite fools-protection, with guaranteed permission from the user:
,--
|if [ `id -u` == "0" ]; then useradd bkernel && su bkernel fi;
`--
