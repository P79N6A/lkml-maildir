If you have unconfined root privilege on an AppArmor box, then setting
up a temporary profile is trivial. As Alan suggests, you could just have
a standard profile for /home/crispin/bin/foo and fun with mv would
switch programs in and out of it. Or for more control, just draft a new
policy and load it; it just takes a few seconds to cp the profile for
something else and edit it a bit, and then load it.
The big difference between the former and latter is that the former is
inflexible (it either works or it doesn't) and the latter requires
privilege.
