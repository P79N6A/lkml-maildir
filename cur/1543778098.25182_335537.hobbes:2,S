This is a airly frequent question
the short answer is 'don't try'
the longer answer is that all the additional optimization options that are 
part of O3+ are considered individually and if they make sense for the 
kernel they are explicitly enabled (in some cases the optimizations need 
to be explicitly turned off for proper functionality of the kernel under 
all versions of GCC)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
