The other issue is that by keeping infos in file* you'll have to scan each fd
to report the ready ones, that will make the method to fall back in O(n).
Anyway there's a pretty good patch (

 ),
that has been tested here :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html
that implement the signal-per-fd mechanism and it achieves a very good scalability too.
