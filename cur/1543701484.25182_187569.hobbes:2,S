Hi folks,
I'm writing this mail as I'm discovering ACPI and framebuffer related problems
on my Acer TravelMate 800LCi notebook with Linux 2.6.1-rc1. First, it's good 
to see that the synaptics-patches from -mm made it into the mainstream kernel,
they are necessary to make the synaptics work together with XFree here.
However, there is a problem with ACPI: /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/performance, 
which was there in previous versions of the kernel and allowed me to slow the 
CPU down in order to save power, disappeared in Linux 2.6.1-rc1. It's simply 
not there anymore. Was it replaced? If so, what is the right way to do it by 
now?
Secondly, there also is a framebuffer related problem. I have VesaFB in kern
and pass 'vga=791' to it at boot time. However, at the time when it switched
to FB in previous versions of Linux, the screen by now simply stays black. 
Is this a known problem and if so is a fix available?
