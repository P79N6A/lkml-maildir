It would be good to characterize parameters as:
1) Things that can be dynamically adjusted at runtime
2) Things that are compiled into the kernel
Naturally, as many things should be moved into (1) as possible, and
the items remaining in (2) ought to be easy to configure. For example,
process rlimit defaults should be in (1).  Today rlimit defaults are
in (2), and are hard to find. Max open files per process and max
processes today require not only a kernel rebuild but rebuilding
user-level software.

This is an excellent example of something that's not worth tuning.
