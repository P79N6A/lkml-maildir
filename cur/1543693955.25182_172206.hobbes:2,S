Block allocation policies affect performance a lot, and keeping them 
simple is important.    I would however be interested in knowing what 
the distribution function for errors by geometry is.  If it turned out 
that, say, errors were higher at the platter edges, I could make some 
format changes....
I think that for users it is best to think about how to mask drive 
errors in the device layer or the device using RAID and mirroring.
