Hello all,
Sorry for the ot'ness, couldn't think of a better place to ask...
I need to encrypt a 100 gig drive and all the implementations seem to use
loopback, which seems to loop a bit too well on the 2 gig mark...
Does loopback do more than 2 gigs on 2.3/2.4? All ideas to solve the
problem are appreciated very much.
TIA
