I'd prefer to update MTD separately if and when the inter_module_xxx 
support gets into both 2.2 and 2.4. 
Could you first provide a patch which adds this support - when it's merged 
into both 2.2 and 2.4 I'll update the MTD code without needing to keep 
backwards-compatibility, and then we can remove get_module_symbol() altogether.
