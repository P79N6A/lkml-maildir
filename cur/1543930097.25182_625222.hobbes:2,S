For a second there, you got me confused, since it wasn't clear to me this 
patch was going over the previous one. When posting patches that are not 
in any tree, it may be wise to include the set they nest onto ;)

Looks fine to me, even though the one above could simply be an:
if (signal_pending(tsk)) {
	...
}
(since the "out" label is used by that "if" only).
