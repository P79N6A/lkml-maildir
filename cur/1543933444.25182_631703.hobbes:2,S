My own experimentation (in device_suspend(), calling _PTS() in the AML after 
each suspend_device() runs, until one device causes it to hang) points to 
ohci_hcd being the culprit here (with or without any devices attached). With 
the ohci_hcd module unloaded, the machine suspends just fine[1].
Of course, I'm at a complete loss as to why suspending OHCI would cause a 
problem for an IO port write.

nvidia-agp cannot be built on x86-64, so it's not the culprit in this case.
