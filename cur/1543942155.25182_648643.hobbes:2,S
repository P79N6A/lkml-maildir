Sorry for the late response (but better late than never).
One may claim that STGT should have lower performance than SCST because
its data path is from userspace. However, your results show that for
non-IB transports, they both show the same numbers. Furthermore, with IB
there shouldn't be any additional difference between the 2 targets
because data transfer from userspace is as efficient as data transfer
from kernel space.
The only explanation that I see is that fine tuning for iSCSI & iSER is
required. As was already mentioned in this thread, with SDR you can get
~900 MB/sec with iSER (on STGT).
