the point was what you said above, which i claimed and still claim to be 
false: "at the source level you can remove a static tracepoint as easily 
as a dynamic tracepoint, the effect of the missing trace information is 
the same either way."
Your point is still incorrect. I gave you an example of how half of the 
tracepoints could be removed under a dynamic scheme - while they couldnt 
be removed under a static scheme. Hence that directly contradicts your 
contention that "you can remove a static tracepoint as easily as a 
dynamic tracepoint". Nothing more, nothing less. I just pointed out the 
point in your thinking that i believe to be incorrect.
Reality is that you can remove a dynamic tracepoint much easier, due to 
the fundamental flexibility of dynamic tracers. While with static 
tracers, every tracepoint has to be _somewhere_ in the source code, 
otherwise people like you will complain just like you did in this mail: 
"you make life more difficult for static tracers for no reason".
You can concede my point or you can dispute that argument - but what you 
did above was neither: you snipped all the quotations and you claimed a 
totally new point. (which new point i never argued with: _of course_ i 
never claimed that __trace function attributes can remove _all_ markups. 
They can "only" remove half of them.)
