Not only does ksymoops support it but some architectures already do
this.  Mind you, they are not consistent :(
Alpha:  Code: 44220001  f4200003  46520400 <a77d9c38> 6b9b4a40  a44803a8  42425401  42c10403  40603401
Arm:    Code: e7973108 e1a02423 (e5c42001) e5c43000 e1a02823
If any instruction in the code line is enclosed in <> or () then
ksymoops assumes that the first byte is EIP.  Otherwise the first byte
of the line is EIP.  Anybody want to update i386/ia64/mips/... oops code
to dump context around the failing instruction?  Maximum of 64 bytes in
the code line please.
