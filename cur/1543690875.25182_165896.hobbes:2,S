Hi Ranjeet,
I noticed this in your .config included in your previous message.
>CONFIG_SND_ENS1370=y
>CONFIG_SND_ENS1371=y
I think the conflict might be occuring between these two drivers.
Look at sound/pci/ens1371.c and sound/pci/ens1370.c.
Out of curiosity, could you try this patch without making any changes to
your config.  If it works properly, could you then verify it in sysfs.
