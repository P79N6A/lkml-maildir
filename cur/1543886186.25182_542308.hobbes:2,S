Subject: [PATCH 0/6] UML - IRQ stacks and smaller kernel stacks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is 2.6.22 material.
This set adds a separate IRQ stack and reduces kernel stack size.
There is also some preparatory cleanup and a new mechanism to keep
track of how close kernel stacks are to exhaustion.
