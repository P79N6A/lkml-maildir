No, it's right, but it's not what you expected.

I suggest to strace() your program to see what happens.

There are four prerequisites for direct IO:
- the file needs to be opened with O_DIRECT
- the buffer needs to be page aligned (hint: use getpagesize() instead
  of assuming that a page is 4k
- reads and writes need to happen *in* multiples of the soft block size
- reads and writes need to happen *at* multiples of the soft block size

There is no problem.

Compile your program with -Wall, you're missing quite some include
files over here.

Make that lseek(fd2, 4 * 4096, SEEK_SET);
> ptr1 = malloc(4096 + 4096-1);

Use memalign() or posix_memalign().

And what happens when count < 0 ?

Check return values.

return 0;

With the changes, the result is:
erik@arthur:/tmp > ls -l directio aaa
-rwxr-xr-x  1 erik erik 49152 2005-08-29 15:26 aaa*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 erik erik 12628 2005-08-29 15:26 directio*
