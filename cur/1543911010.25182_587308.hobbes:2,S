Where is the difference comming from? Are you using SYSENTER
for the hypercall?  I can't really see you using SYSENTER,
because how would you do system calls then? I bet system calls
are more frequent than in/out, so if you have decide between the
two using them for syscalls is likely faster.
For an int XYZ gate i wouldn't expect that much difference to
a #GP fault.
Also I fail to see the fundamental speed difference between
mov index,register
int 0x...

switch (register) 
case xxxx: do emulation
versus
out ...
#gp
-> switch (*eip) {
case 0xee:  /* etc. */

So the hardware already checks that.
The only case where you would need to check yourself is if you emulate
NX on non NX capable hardware, but I can't see you doing that.

Most of this is a single byte which is the same as the hypercall
demux. Essentially a table lookup if you use the obvious switch()
