Subject: [GIT PATCH] More I2C and hwmon patches for 2.6.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/8/6

Here are some small i2c and hwmon patches.  They fix some bugs that were
caused by the previous round of i2c patches, and should go in before
2.6.15-rc1 is out.  Most of these are in the last -mm release.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/i2c-2.6.git/
or from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/i2c-2.6.git/
if it isn't synced up yet.
The full patch series will sent to the sensors mailing lists, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
