There's also a third approach which is sort of a hybrid -- decouple
storage and storage management. You have your central machine which
manages the filesystem and handles acess control, and then your
disks. Clients talk to both the storage manager and the disks directly 
over whatever interconnect you like. Our NASD research project uses this
approach.
And yeah, there's no question that you really, really don't want to
put all of your disks behind a single machine.
