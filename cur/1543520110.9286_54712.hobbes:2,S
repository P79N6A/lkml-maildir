Hi there,
My notebook is doing something weird... When I put it into sleep mode, it
goes to sleep. I can then bring it back from sleep mode and it wakes up
mostly fine, except I have to re-up my eth0 (intel pcmcia nic). If I then
put it to sleep again, it stays that way. Have to hard-powerdown and then
power back up to awake it. 
The notebook is a Sony F305 Vaio, and the kernel is 2.2.13
I saw something about this a while back, but lost the thread so couldn't
follow it through.
Thanks,
