Subject: [HOWTO] Quick howto fix on the new task queue

the majority of the problems i am seeing with the new task queue is that,
on list init, *next is still being used. all of that was replaced by a
single list member in the new implementation.
on init, *next is typically set to NULL. for the new task queue, there is
a macro to initialize the list: INIT_LIST_HEAD, so we simply need to use
that in lieu.
thus, replace something like:
penguin->tq.next -> NULL;
with:
INIT_LIST_HEAD(&penguin->tq.list);
this is the only problem i am seeing in pre8 ... i am still looking for
some documentation on the new interface, but the source (where i got the
above, hopefully i am right) is readable.
