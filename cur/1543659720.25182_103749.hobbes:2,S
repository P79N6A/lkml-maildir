Subject: [PATCH][RESEND w/ reasonable Subject] alsa before oss in Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/15/219

I should have changed the subject when I first sent this....
[re OSS vs ALSA audio drivers]
Linus> So I don't see a huge reason to remove them from the sources,
Linus> but we might well make them harder to select by mistake, for
Linus> example. Right now the config help files aren't exactly helpful,
Linus> and the OSS choice is before the ALSA one, which looks wrong.
Linus> They should probably be marked deprecated, and if they don't
Linus> get a lot of maintenance, that's fine.
Like this?
