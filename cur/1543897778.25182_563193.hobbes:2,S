Definitely.  Anything else makes review more difficult, by obscuring 
changes with movement.

I don't think checkpatch should be removed, but the 80-column complaint 
is -way- too obnoxious and stupid-simple.
This bugs me like the myriad recent Documentation/CodingStyle proposed

everything into a rule.  There is such a thing as specifying too much.
