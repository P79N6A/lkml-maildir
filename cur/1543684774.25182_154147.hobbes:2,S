Thanks for testing. The difference should only be noticable as X and other 
interactive tasks remaining responsive under heavy load. Audio skips are far 
less relevant any more.

No this is what I need to understand what went wrong. These hacks work on 
changing the value of PRI basically. The wine/wineserver issue is an unusual 
one as you've described it, and at O11 the test I put in to determine a task 
is interactive by credits seems to select out the wrong one and keep that one 
elevated. 
Anyway most of this discussion is now moot as I've discussed with Ingo at 
length a lot of the little things I've found that help and I suspect he will 
develop his own, better solutions for them.
