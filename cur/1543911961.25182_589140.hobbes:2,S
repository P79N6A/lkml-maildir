I like the general idea of this LSM.
One question about your security model, though:
If I understand your LSM correctly, MAC override is based on
capabilities, specifically on CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE. So any root process
which doesn't explicitly give up this capability is effectively
unconfined, right?
If so, this is a serious limitation that should be mentioned in the
docs. File capabilities should alleviate this problem, but they first
need to be configured correctly...

I think a link to further documentation would be nice.
Maybe you could include the README from your site in Documentation/?
BTW: Some documentation missing there:
* the various mount options
* how to enable cipso (Do I have to enable it explicitly? Most people
  won't even know what cipso is)

Can you explain why you limit syslog that way?

Leftover debugging printk? Otherwise, a level would be nice.

Ditto.

I'm not very versed in the VFS, so I don't think I understand the code
fully there, but shouldn't the above read /smack/links?

I really don't understand your symlink code (not because it's bad, I just
don't know this area), so this is just a question:
Wouldn't S_IRUGO be enough for the links entry?

Ah, so you dynamically add symlinks here. Can the user do this, too? If
so, how? A little documentation might be nice.
