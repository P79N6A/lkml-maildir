Subject: [PATCH 0/9] i386 MMU paravirtualization patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These patches provide the infrastructure for paravirtualized MMU operations
while at the same time cleaning up and optimizing the pagetable accessors for
i386.  They should be largely uncontroversial and are well tested.  There are
still some performance gains to be had for paravirtualization, but it is more
important to get the native code base that will enable them checked in first.
