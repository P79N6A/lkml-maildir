Per alexn's request, I'm mailing you a pointer to this bug.  I'm running 2.6.12-rc2 and he asked me to verify the problem still exists in rc5.  Unfortunately, I am not able to upgrade to rc5 and recompile the kernel at the moment.  I did read through the rc5 changes and a) saw no information about this bug in the changelog, and b) it appears the potentially relevant patches to ide-cd.c and block_dev.c are already in rc2.  Specifically, the hard set of capacity to ox1fffff if the stat fails is still in rc5.
I hope this is helpful,
Chuck
