No, the 2.2.x's does call oom() (at least for x < 10). This was discussed
before in the "Allocation of too much memory hangs system, kernel 2.2.*"
thread. I know I sent you (and everyone else on that Cc list) some of my
testresults, including, for 2.2.7:
...
Out of memory for init.
...
Your change and Rik's more advanced should work for the problem I have
generated with postgresql (one process that grows, should be max for you
and get the highest "Rik-badness" score)
Does Rik's patch also spare the X server?
There is something about not killing things with direct hardware access,
giving score of 0 to them, which is lower than root owned processes such
as init (with points >>= 2;).
Perhaps a special handling of some other processes should be added (init,
kflushd?, kpiod?, kswapd?, ...). 0 points does not mean that it can't be
killed, just that it will be killed last, right?
