I believe that one of the short comings of the active/expired array mechanism is that it can lead to excessive queuing (possibly even starvation) of tasks that aren't considered "interactive".
Rick showed me schedstats graphs of the two ... it seems to have lower
latency, does less rebalancing, fewer pull_tasks, etc, etc. Everything
looks better ... he'll send them out soon, I think (hint, hint).
