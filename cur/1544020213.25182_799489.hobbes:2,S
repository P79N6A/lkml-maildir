Thank you very much and sorry, my reply was intended to go to the list
but it's the first time I use google mail with a list and it is much
different.
Well I have neither hardware nor documents around here and the dmesg
output doesn't tell me anything more than I already stated :(

OK memtest is running but there is one other thing I forgot to
mention, we had the same problem on two different machines.
Furthermore it always affects the ext3 filesystem and not the ext2
partition which is much smaller with only 1GB and mounted r/o on the
final system, but that is where most of the software gets installed.
And the problem is triggered at installation time so don't you think
it should more likely hit the ext2 partition if it is not an ext3
problem?
