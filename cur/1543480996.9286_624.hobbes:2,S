interesting... looks 64k short...
mine for a 32MB machine:
(don't have access to the boot log for my 128MB machine right now)
Memory: 31180k/32768k available (520k kernel code, 384k reserved, 684k
data)
the 2960K (131008-128048) is the amount used by the kernel... which
seems
about right...
probably something in the BIOS... initial guess would be ram being
shadowed 
or a memory hole...
Don't think it is anything to worry about.
(any gurus out there have a more knowledgable answer?)
