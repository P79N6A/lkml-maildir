I'm not sure what "simulation" means.
Could you tell me how/what do you expect memory hotplug
simulation exactly?
Memory hot-add code is included in kernel. And, remove(unplug) code
has developed (and hopefully, it will be merged to -mm after
some cleanups, I think.)
I would like to make sure what is necessary.
Thanks.
