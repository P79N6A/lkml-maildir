Subject: BUG: kernel panic at startup, 2.6.7 on x86

I tried syncing with 2.6.7 bk version, compiled with my 2.6.5 config, installed, 
and rebooted.  Everything was okay up to the point where it runs a script to set 
up my dsl connection.  At that point I got the following on the console:
"Starting adsl: Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!  In interrupt 
handler -- not syncing."
Unfortunately, that was all I got.
Here's the output of lspci.  Note, the linksys cards use the tulip driver.
