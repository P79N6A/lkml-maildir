Most things, I guess... :-) That's like changing the semantics of any
more or less standard system call.
OTOH, what can be done is to change all Linux-specific ioctl's to take 
a structure above and to leave the cross-platform ones intact (like
BSD screen ctl etc). Then, a program in question would have an ugly
table which would store lengths of the 3rd arg based on an ioctl
number - still better than nothing.
