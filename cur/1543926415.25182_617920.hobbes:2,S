Well, my experience with moderation has been that moderated mails are
stuck in some queue for weeks.  Two seperate lists, neither of them was
alsa.  If also is doing a better job, great.  But it still has to live
with the general reputation of non-subscriber moderation.

Been there, done that.  In spite of people not being drooling retards,
the amount of time and effort they invest into either moderation or
improving the ruleset is quite limited.  Problems persist.
And even without mails being held hostage for weeks, every single
moderation mail is annoying.  Like the one I'm sure to receive after
sending this out.
