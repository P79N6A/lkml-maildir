We (HP) would like to use multipath i/o with the cciss driver.
(which is a block driver).
We can use the md driver for this.  However, we cannot boot from
such a multipath device.  Lilo and grub do not understand md multipath
devices, nor do anaconda or other installers.  (Enhancing all of those,
I'd like to avoid.  Cramming multipath i/o into the low level driver
would accomplish that, but, too yucky.) 
If there is work going on to enhance the multipath support in linux
it would be nice if you could boot from and install to such devices.
