Hi,
Thanks, the patch works perfect ;)
But there are two problems left:
1. I have an ESS1938 soundcard and an ENS1371 soundcard...
When I compile both into kernel only one is shown in /dev/sound and only /dev/dsp exists
/dev/snd seems to show all devices
I think this is somehow related to devfs
2. My ENS1371 works perfect with quake3arena or return to castle wolfenstein.
But my ESS1938 has very noise and hacked sound. The game also runs slowlier than with the ENS1371
Normal sound applications like xmms and so work perfect with both cards
