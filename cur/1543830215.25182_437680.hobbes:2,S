Well.  It's the assembly code which chose to call start_kernel().  It could
call something else.

That won't fix the other bugs - we're presently calling printk() prior to
setup_arch(), and printk uses smp_procesor_id().

It's a bit odd - I think non-zero BSPs happen a bit more often than
only-on-voyager.
