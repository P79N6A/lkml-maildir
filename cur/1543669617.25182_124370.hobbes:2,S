Ok, that's reasonable. I was imagining that
guessing when you need to enable it for an
open fd that is going to be inherited by
someone else's code that may not even have
been written yet is rather a vague proposition,
while guessing when you need to disable it regardless of what the code that you pass it to
does is likely to be all too clear and made
much of in online discussions.
But some application author not noticing that a potential flink() vulnerability is there at all will perhaps be the more common failure
scenario(so I yield the point).
flink() does seem a useful tool that I've wanted in the past (for reasons similar to the linker
example) if one could get around the implicit
security risk of a naive implementation.
