There are some valid uses for peeking through /dev/mem. Things like
dmidecode for example.  So you don't want to disable it completely
in a lot of cases, but have fine-grained access to specific parts
of the file.  I'm not sure SELinux can do this. Maybe the MLS stuff
helps here (though I'm far from an expert on this, so I could be
talking out of my rear).
The restricted dev/mem patches we've had in Fedora for a while
do the right thing, but they're a bit crufty (in part due to
drivers/char/mem.c being a bit of a mess before we even start
patching it).  I've had "clean these up for upstream" on my
todo for a while. I might get around to it one of these days.
