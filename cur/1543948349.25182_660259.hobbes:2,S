Here's some examples of the functional changes between the default 
actions of the various mempolicy modes and the new behavior with 
MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES or MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES.
To read this, the logical order follows from the left-most column to the 
right-most:
 - "mems" is the task's mems_allowed as constrained by its attached
   cpuset,
 - "nodemask" is the mask passed with the set_mempolicy() or mbind() call 
   for that particular policy,
 - the first "result" is the nodemask that the policy is effected over,
 - "rebind" is the nodemask of a subsequent change to the cpuset's mems,
   and
 - the second "result" is the nodemask that the policy is now effected 
   over.

 [*] Notice how the resulting nodemask for all of these examples when
     creating the mempolicy is intersected with mems_allowed.  This is
     the current behavior, with contextualize_policy(), and is identical
     to the initial result of the MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES case.
     Perhaps it would make more sense to remap the nodemask when it is
     created, as well, in the ~MPOL_F_STATIC_NODES case.  For example, in
     this case, the "result" would be 1-3 instead.
     That is a departure from what is currently implemented in HEAD (and,
     thus, can be used as ample justification for the above behavior) but
     makes more sense.  Thoughts?

      again be 2.

 [***] All of these results are wrong and will be corrected in the next
       posting of the patchset.  They change the preferred node in some
       cases to be a node that is expressly excluded from being accessed
       by the cpuset mems change.
