This is irrelevant for root.

Both AFS and Coda have a 4*32bit identifier on each file. Therefore,
don't call it open_by_inode(), call it open_by_handle(), it is much
more general.

Why do you have to know where .. is in order to open a file?
Some file systems may not be able to implement open_by_handle(), but
then, what's the problem? Then they just can't be used for speeding
things up.
