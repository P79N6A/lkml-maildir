Yes, but I always considered the ec_read/write functions being an hack
in order to support sonypi at first.  If it's possible to kill them
and to replace them with the acpi_ec_read|write, well this would be
good IMHO.

An intermediate solution would be to use the already existing
ec_read|write instead of the one you want to use.  The original
SMBus driver used acpi_ec_read because the author wanted to be
sure that driver will support laptops with more than one EC, but
he never saw such laptops so far.
