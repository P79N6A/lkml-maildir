I see in the patch you mailed later that you got it figured out already, 
using a relative path.
And yeah, it's not particularly beautiful. But I do not see any nice and 
easy way, either. What would help a lot, of course, would be to split this 
into two modules, one generic one, one arch-specific one. Have you 
considered doing that?
