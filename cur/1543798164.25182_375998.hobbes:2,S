But your user space that would add the routes is not so protected so I'm
not sure this is actually a solution, more of an extended fudge. In
which case I'm not clear why it is any better than the current
GFP_ATOMIC approach.

Lots of hidden conditional logic on critical paths. Also sk should be in
brackets so that the macro evaluation order is defined as should flags
