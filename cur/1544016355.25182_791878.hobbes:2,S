That paragraph is not true.  According to the standard:
"The host is allowed to shut down the clock of a “busy” card. The card will complete the programming
operation regardless of the host clock. However, the host must provide a clock edge for the card to turn
off its busy signal. Without a clock edge the card (unless previously disconnected by a deselect command
-CMD7) will force the DAT0 line down, forever."
i.e. during busy state the clock is only needed to check whether the busy state is over.
I will resend the patch, without that paragraph and with a fix to report the
error code when there is a timeout error in the busy state.
