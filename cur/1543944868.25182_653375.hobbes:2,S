you are right.
good point out.
current implementation may cause wake up the no relate process of
memory shortage zone ;-)
but unfortunately, we can't know per zone rss.
(/proc/[pid]/numa_maps is very slow, we can't use it
 at memory shortage emergency)
I think we need develop per zone rss.
it become not only improve mem_notify, but also improve
oom killer of more intelligent process choice.
but it is a bit difficult. (at least for me ;-)
may be, I will implement it a bit later...
Thanks again!
your good opnion may improve my patch.
