	One other point about this...  While there is a mount option (ugly),
the mount option is totally inoperative when the compile option is enabled
(yes, I had a slight typo in my previous message where I said enabled
twice).  Even IF I put the code into smbmount to autodetect the Windows 95
connections (which I want to do), the user space program can not override
that compile option if it's enabled.  If the compile option is disabled, I
can set or clear that "feature" on a mount-by-mount, connection-by-connection,
basis.  As long as that option is enabled in the build, I'm screwed.  I
can't do anything from user space to correct the problem.
