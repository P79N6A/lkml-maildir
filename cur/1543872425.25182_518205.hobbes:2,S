This was the whole reason we didn't adopt VMI directly.  Instead,
preferring an kernel internal API, pv_ops, that can adopt naturally
as the kernel changes, and it is the pv_ops client code's (or backend
as it is also referred to) responsibility to do whatever is necessary
to map back to the hypervisor's ABI.  The goal was explicitly to keep
things internal fluid as usual.  As I said before, no matter how you
slice it there's glue code somewhere to deal with compatibilities.
And it's always been the virtualization platform's responsibility to
deal with the changes.
