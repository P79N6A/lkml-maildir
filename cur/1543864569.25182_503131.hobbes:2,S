If that is the case, can we rename the file from core_flags to something
more descriptive like dump_core_skip_anonymous_mappings.  The name
is a wild suggestion, the renaming does seem fairly important to me.
Remember once you get this in, changing the name will be fairly difficult
as admin tools and documentation will adopt the name.  These are usually
cases where it is better to do it right the first time.
Thanks,
Robin
