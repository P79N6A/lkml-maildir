Another solid reason to write infiniband off. I keep hoping that the IB 
vendor crowd will stop shooting themselves in the head with such 
regularity, and they just won't. They just keep increasing the size of the 
bore. 
Infiniband can now be spelled a few different ways, "I2O" and "ATM" come 
to mind, except that "ATM" was less unsuccessful in its lifetime than IB 
has been so far.

Well, we non-vendors have no power, and it appears the vendors are 
determined to kill IB. 
This is all very discouraging. A lot of people at the Labs put a lot of
work into the Infiniband openib effort, including getting money to support
the software development, and it looks like we're not going to get very
far if these rules stick. I am going to renew my search for non-IB
solutions, I guess. It's hard to recommend this interconnect when IBTA
takes this kind of action.
