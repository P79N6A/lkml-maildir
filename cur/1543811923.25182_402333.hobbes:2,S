Subject: [RFC] Enabling of libata PATA support

Hi all,
does anyone know the status of the libata PATA support?
I know that Alan Cox is intensively working on them, so they should be
in a reasonable state by now.
If that is the case, couldn't we enable PATA support as _optional_
drivers? This would get us ACPI support for those chipset for free (as
SATA ACPI support will be included, yes Jens?). And this is required on
most modern Laptops for suspend to RAM (and possibly also suspend to
disk) to work properly.
Thoughts?
Cheers,
Hannes
