Cool..

Because you might disturb other folks' _data_, if reiserfs goes wonky.
It's easy to say "reiserfs is a bit too unproven for /home, but I'll
happily put my squid cache onto it", without realising

I think Alan meant that reiserfs imports an awful lot of buffer cache
internals which filesystems aren't supposed to see.

Yes, but if (as has been suggested) the plan is finally to get the RAID
patches in before 2.4 (please, please, please, etc), then I reckon it's
better to delay journalling.

If 2.5++ is at least as quick to come out as 2.4, then my opinion, such
as it is, is that the various journalling patches could live quite happily
as well-maintained external patches, just as RAID and LVM have (though
hopefull not for as long :)
