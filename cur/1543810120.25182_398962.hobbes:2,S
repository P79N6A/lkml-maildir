I think the first thing we have to do, is not to decide which pids we 
want to see, but what and how we want to virtualize.

BTW, really, why not both?
Eric, can we do something universal which will suite all the parties?

This sounds good. But pspaces are also used for access controls. So this 
should be incorparated there as well.
