I think it is totally wrong to make this Configs and boot options.
Nobody can do anything with such obscure boot configurations
and it is bad to require kernel recompiles for such things.
The right way to do this would be to have sysfs knobs that allow
to change these bits, and then let a user space tool change
it depending on PCI-ID. If the issue is critical enough
that it happens very often then it should be added to kernel
pci quirks - but again be unconditional.
