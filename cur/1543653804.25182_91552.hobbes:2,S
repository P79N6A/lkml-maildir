Hey,
That is my first mail here :). I get strange problems recording a cd. It
almost completely locks my network traffic.
Sometimes it seems that only TCP is locked, and UDP is fine, sometimes
everything is fine, and somethimes nothing gets through my link.
Hw & sw:
recorder:	Teac CD-W58E
internet link:	through RS232 interface
software:
kernel:		2.4.18, 2.4.19.
pppd:		2.4.1b2
cdrtools:	1.11a35
I'm using a recorder with scsi-emulation. Additional small problem is that
sometimes (unmounted) cd wouldn't open, and I need to cdrecord -eject.
Kernel logs are clean.
my kernel .config is here: 
http://www.src.filip.eu.org/kernel/config
I find it hard to trace this problem, that's why I am writing here :).
regards,
Filip djMedrzec Zyzniewski
