Andrew, the following small patch is critical to have after:
iget-stop-unionfs-from-using-iget-and-read_inode.patch
Question: since the above patch isn't in my unionfs.git tree (not until the
whole iget series makes it to Linus), then do you prefer if I give you a
replacement patch to the above patch, or a small incremental one; either
way, you can choose to fold the above and below patches into one.
Thanks,
Erez.
