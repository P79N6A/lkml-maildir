   For ISA devices pass NULL.
That is the recommended method for drivers that have to deal
with ISA and PCI variants of a chipset.
However, for "purely x86 ISA" devices one may use
isa_bus_to_virt and isa_virt_to_bus.
I hesitate to even mention this because what people should _not_ do is
just put "isa_" in front of the virt_to_bus et al. calls in all the
PCI drivers that stopped to link now.
There are other tangental issues I'd like to address and clarify in
this area.  This includes the "what can be invoked from interrupt"
questions.  Currently I think pci_{alloc,free}_consistent() should be
valid from an interrupt.
