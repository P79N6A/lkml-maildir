The define exists for the same reason that HAVE_xxx exists in 
include/linux/netdevice.h and other headers:  a feature test macro, so 
code using this pointer can detect its presence or absence.  The world 
of drivers is not all in the kernel tarball, ya know ;-)
But as I said, the macro is misnamed, it should be 
HAVE_UPPER_PRIVATE_DATA or similar.
