This is a fix off of the Compaq Presario 1675 Linux support page. I got
tired of having to hand patch the kernel each time so I made it a PS/2
mouse config option. The touchpad periodically freaks without this
patch. I know it works for the Compaq Presario 167x series and I guess
it works for any of the laptops using the Synaptic Touchpad.
I didn't write the fix so I'm just guessing that if there is an error on
reading input from the keyboard that the mouse info is hosed.
