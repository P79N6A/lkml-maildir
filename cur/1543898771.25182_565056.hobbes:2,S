Might make a nice scientific paper, but even according to your own 
optimistic numbers it's not realistic that you will ever achieve any 
visible improvement even if you'd find 100 places in hotpaths you could 
mark this way.
And a better direction for hotpaths seems to be Andi's __cold/COLD in 
-mm without adding an own framework for doing such things.
