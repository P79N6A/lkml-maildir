my portable news/mail terminal (486dx-50, 8MB, 340 HDD, Compaq) is fitted
with an Eigernet 10MBit PCMCIA card. Works like a charm, although I had to
recompile pcmcia-3.0.3 for it (kernel 2.0.34 up to now). This card should be
at about $50 (I paid DM 100 for it) and it gives me about 500-600k/s on a
10Mbit Ethernet.
