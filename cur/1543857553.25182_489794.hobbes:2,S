OK, thanks for the update.  We would like to make smbfs go away asap, but
from my POV it's up to you to say when we should do that.
otoh, it might be a good idea to merge a variant of that patch which
doesn't mention a specific data.  Say,
	if (warn_count < 5) {
		warn_count++;
		printk(KERN_EMERG "smbfs is not being maintained."
			" Please migrate to cifs\n");
	}
?

No, smbfs is not in very good shape.
