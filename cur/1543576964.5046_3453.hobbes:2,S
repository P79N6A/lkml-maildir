I'm intrigued... how did you resolve the 'mem_map_inc_count' and
'mem_map_dec_count',
'put_module_symbol' and 'get_module_symbol' references?
It's only of academic interest for me now as I've ditched the nvidia -
not worth the hassle.
Amusingly, We're breaking the EULA even by reading the supplied source
code...
