[...] My version of the loop tools also do all this correctly too. But the loop
most people seem to be using is as insecure as always.  Congratulations
that you fixed it too.
Still considering the other points I think a stacked file system would
be far better  (integrated meta data, separate keys for different files etc.)
Even though I invested quite some work into fixing loop I still think it's a bad
hack, not a real design.

It's as as vunerable, but more stable. The mainline IVs are basically useless
for security purposes but broke  on disk format compatibility all the time when 
someone misguided decided again to "improve" the IV format in loop.c (happened far too 
often in the past). In my own loop tools I used them with an hashed IV, added some 
hacks for different IV versions as far as they were fixable and grumbingly converted
the disk format in one case.
[... encrypted swap using a random key for each session...]
Good point. I didn't think of that. Still it's a lot of overhead if you
only use crypto occassionally. With the tainted bit it would be possible to only encrypt 
pages of processes that have been tainted or better not page them out at all.
