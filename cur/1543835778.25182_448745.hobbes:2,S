The issues noted in the code are still almost all low priority
(non-blocking).
 - The FIXME about choosing the address is very low priority,
   and would affect only multi-master systems.  The fix would
   involve defining a new i2c-specific struct for platform_data,
   updating various boards to use it (e.g. OSK can use 400 MHz),
   and wouldn't change behavior for any board I've ever seen.
 - Likewise with the REVISIT for the bus speed to use.  They'd
   be fixed with the same patch.
 - The REVISIT about maybe a better way to probe is also low
   priority; someone with a board that needs better probing
   could address it at that time.  (Then restest any changes
   on multiple generations of silicion ... which IMO is the
   role the linux-omap tree should play.)
 - The revisit about adap->retries is still up in the air,
   and was a question in my submission from last year.
   How exactly is that supposed to be used?  Right now
   it's neither initialized (except to zero) nor tested.
Re coding style issues, I didn't give it a detailed nitpick
but I did easily notice two things worth fixing:
 - Some lines are more than 80 characters, so they'll wrap
   on standard editor windows.
 - There are a couple instances of hidden whitespace to
   remove:  at end of line, or space-before-tab.
This doesn't include the drivers/Makefile change to push i2c
linkage up near the beginning with other "system" busses,
but that can be a separate patch in any case (assuming that
it's still needed).
Assuming those two coding style things get resolved first,
