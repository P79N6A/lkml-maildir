OK, thanks - the Fedora RPM from several days ago is still 5.36 based,
I just pulled the CVS version and it starts up much more nicely.  Only quirk:

Nov 10 18:04:32 turing-police smartd[18988]: Device /dev/sda: SATA disks accessed via libata are supported by Linux kernel versions 2.6.15-rc1 and above. Try adding '-d ata' or '-d sat' to the smartd.conf config file line. 
Well, yeah. I'm on 2.6.19-rc5-mm1 and the config file *has* '-d ata' already. ;)
I'd file a bug report against that, except it's time for me to leave the office
and forage for some dinner. :)
