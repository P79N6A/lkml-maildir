You can be pretty sure someone, somewhere will bypass that library,
hardcode types into application, and break it on 64-bit platform.
If I were you, I'd just replace read and write with ioctl, and leave
the rest of design as it was. If we find that someone who bypasses
your userspace library, at least we have a way to deal with it. (And
"cat a file and kill machine" issue is gone, too).
