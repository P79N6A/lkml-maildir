Nope. Take a look at the first loop-through-the-zones in alloc_pages
(preferably in akpm's tree that is cleaned up a bit).
We go through *all* zones first and allocate them down to pages_low
before kicking kswapd.
I have tried kicking kswapd before going off node, but it frees memory
really aggressively - so you're nearly left with a local alloc policy.

At the end of the day we'll possibly just have to have a sysctl. I
don't think all regressions could be eliminated completely. We'll
see.

Didn't parse that. If you mean the transition from highmem->normal->dma
zones, I don't think that should be treated in this way. Imagine small
highmem zones for example. We have the lower zone protection in place
for that case - and that is something that in turn isn't good for NUMA,
because the SGI guys (I think) already ran into that and fixed it to be
per-node only.
