Hi guys,
I've EGCS 1.1.2 , Kernel 2.2.6ac1 , glibc2.0.7 and Debian Linux Dist.
Also I've asm, linux and scsi in /usr/include as symlinks to
/usr/src/linux/include/asm, linux and scsi.
When compiling I get a mismatch declaration of ntohl() & htonl() in files
netinet/in.h and byteorder/generic.h.
Where I'm wrong ?
TIA,
    Davide.
