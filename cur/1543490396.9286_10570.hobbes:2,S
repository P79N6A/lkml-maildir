While figuring out why kbdrate caused a kernel panic on SPARC, I did
some spelunking through the various keyboard-related things inside the
kernel.  It appears that there's a lovely common API for setting the
keyboard repeat rate, KDKBDREP, but that the only platform that implements
it is m68k.
Is there any particular reason why this is the case?
As far as the kernel panic goes, that's kbdrate's fault for trying to frob
/dev/port.  The below patch fixes it, but is it the Right Thing?
