Except that it would pretty much confuse any existing OS. The only key
prefix is E0, because E1 is only used for a single key, and that's fake
right shift, which should be discarded anyway even before a keycode is
generated.
Anyway, we definitely don't want scancode dependent keycodes. Keycodes
should be the same for all types of keyboards (Be it PS/2, USB, or ADB),
so that you can have a single set of N keymaps (us, gb, french, czech,
whatever), and not N*M keymaps for different languages and keyboard
types.
This simplifies things both in the kernel (a bit), and userspace (a lot).
Now, speaking about a fixed scancode->something mapping, atkbd.c in 2.5
uses this encoding:
	   xxxxxxxx -> 0 xxxxxxxx	
	E0 xxxxxxxx -> 1 xxxxxxxx
Note that no make/break bit is used, as the keyboard is operated in 
"Set 2" of scancodes, where release is signalled by the F0 prefix, and
not by the highest bit. And since the keycode is passed on as an input
event, we don't need to encode make/break into the keycode on the output
either.
The real question is, when we have these 16-bit (or more bit) keycodes,
how do we export them to the userspace? In cooked mode, there is no
problem, we can extend the keymaps. But both medium raw and raw modes
are pretty much limited in the number of keys they can carry. See 2.5
keyboard.c for the current imperfect solution.
IMHO applications which now use raw mode should instead switch to using
the event devices in /dev/input ...

There are, but fortunately not that much weird.
