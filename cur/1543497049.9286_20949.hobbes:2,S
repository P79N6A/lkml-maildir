Hi,
sorry for the delay, but linux-kernel is running behind...
Thanks very much for posting your data.
Have you tried Andrea's patch
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel/2.2.9_andrea3.bz2
 ?
I suspect it would help your SMP performance.
See 
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html
Please do keep us informed of your progress.
(Er, you did mean 512MBytes RAM, not 512KBytes, RAM, right?)
Thanks,
Dan
