A large buffer could solve the problem, but would'nt it be better if the driver
could get a fore-warning when the flip buffer was on the verge of getting full?
It could then stop the RX interrupts until the "flush_to_ldisc" would empty and
flip the flip buffer and inform the driver about the same. I have had instances
on a loaded system with all the ports on a mulltiport card doing RX s, the
"flush_to_ldisc" will not be scheduled enough to make sufficient free space on
the flip buffer for the next RX interrupt.

sameer.
