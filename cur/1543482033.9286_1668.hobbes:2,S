Subject: 2.2.0pre9 - 3 BUGS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/1/25/44

VFAT:
	'mv' gives OOPS in pre8, pre9 claims the file doesn't exist.
SMBFS:
	SMB retry - signal not valid error -3.
CD-Changer's (IDE/others?):
	Kernel doesn't detect them since pre8.
	/proc says it's a changer but with 0 slots.
	at least this happens with my Teac CD-68E (ATAPI 6slots changer)
	2.0.x works, 2.1.123 works, 2.2.0pre?-6 work too...
If you wanna know more mail me at jmassar@unfix.org.
Greets,
