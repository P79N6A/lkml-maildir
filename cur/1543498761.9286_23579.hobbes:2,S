Don't be too sure of that - try the following command:
 Q> touch 'x?y' ; ls -l 'x?y'
I've just tried it, and it works fine here...

Split that into two rules:
 4. If the file is executable.
The fact that a file is executable does not automatically make it a
dynamic URL, but it's probably wise to leave that decision to the
userland server.
 5. If the file is non-world readable.
In this case, if it hasn't been caught by the previous rule, then it's
also non-accessible and khttpd should just return "403 Forbidden" or
"404 File Not Found" as preferred. You can check this out for yourself
quite easily as 
http://www.memalpha.cx/test.html
 is just such a file,
a valid web page with mode 600.

It's probably a good idea to make that a general configuration file
for khttpd with rules of the form...
 Q> dynamic='cga-bin'
 Q> hide-403=no
...where the first line specifies the directories that are considered
signs of a dynamic URL and the second specifies whether to allow the
return codes to leak information about inaccessible files. Add other
lines as needed.
Alternatively, make /proc/sys/khttpd a directory with files therein
/proc/sys/khttpd/options with lines like "hide-403=no" in it, and
/proc/sys/khttpd/dynamic-directories containing a list of the names of
directories that have dynamic content.
One final point: How will khttpd handle virtual hosting, or doesn't
it handle that?
Best wishes from Riley.
