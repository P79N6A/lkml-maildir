Davide's code explanation looks nice - do you think it sufficient?

This sounds real harsh as this means that it does not, in fact, go in. I'm
no guru but the code in question looks sane and reasonable. The state of the
kernel right now is such that I would really advocate this going in, I'm
sure we can get commitment to vet this code - which is all the easier
because it is going to see more use.
I'll be releasing a version of mtasker (
http://ds9a.nl/mtasker
) later today
which uses epoll which I'm going to take into production.
