Rather than just assuming that there are page tables there, if you
added the usual checks which the kernel typically does, you might
get a clue as to what's going on.
You'll find that the PMD is not valid as far as the Linux page table
walking goes - that's because we don't use a set of individual page
mappings to setup the kernel mapping of the page.  In turn, that
means that there is no individual control over the status of pages
allocated by alloc_pages.
To solve your problem, you need to look at the ARM DMA mmap extension
and use that instead.
