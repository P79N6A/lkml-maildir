It's a tour allright, but not the kind of guided tour that we
might want to provide to people interested in the kernel...
If no such tour is available for the recent kernels, I hereby
volunteer to help set up such a thing. The next few months,
unfortunately, I will be busy with a few projects, but if all
goes well, I'll have enough time from december onwards...

      if you sent me anything important during that period,
      you know what to do :)
