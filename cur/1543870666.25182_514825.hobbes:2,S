In this particular case, the system even has swap free.
The kernel just chooses not to use it until it has scanned
some memory, due to the way the swappiness algorithm works.
With 32 CPUs diving into the page reclaim simultaneously,
each trying to scan a fraction of memory, this is disastrous
for performance.  A 256GB system should be even worse.

Not AFAIK.
I would like to see separate pageout selection queues
for anonymous/tmpfs and page cache backed pages.  That
way we can simply scan only that what we want to scan.
There are several ways available to balance pressure
between both sets of lists.
Splitting them out will also make it possible to do
proper use-once replacement for the page cache pages.
Ie. leaving the really active page cache pages on the
page cache active list, instead of deactivating them
because they're lower priority than anonymous pages.
That way we can do a backup without losting the page
cache working set.
