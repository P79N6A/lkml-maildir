Yes, such a scheme should work fine.  (Had something like that in my patch, 
but it was cut out to avoid any chance of breaking flat P4 boxen.)
Once you've determined that you have a system with xAPICs, how do you intend 
to distinguish between those delivering interrupts through the serial bus vs. 
the system bus?  (Correct me if I'm wrong, but your patch didn't define the 
new I/O APIC register that contains the serial/parallel status bit.)
How will you decide between a box that always must use clustered APIC mode, 
like the x440, vs. one which can be operated in flat mode, like the x360?  (I 
only include the x360 in my summit patch to avoid having all the interrupts 
hit CPU 0.  Otherwise, it is a flat box that delivers interrupts through the 
system bus.)  What about other flat P4 systems?
