The core piece of the puzzle is cpu_mask_to_apicid().  At the
time we setup the io_apic TARGET_CPUS will just be the bootstrap
processor.    So we might be able to get away with hard coding
the bootstrap processor in the non-SMP sections of the ioapic
startup code.
setup_ioapic_dest is going to fix things after we start the
cpus anyway so it should not be a problem.
Does that sound like a sane thing to do?
This code appears to affect all of the subarchitectures but the
default x86 one.  So it is clearly not just an ES7000 problem.
Now to figure out why Linus's laptop hates this patch...
