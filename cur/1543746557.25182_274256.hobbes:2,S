This compile error (as well as the other two compile errors you 
reported) comes from the fact, that you disabled the option
  Code maturity level options
    Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
      Select only drivers expected to compile cleanly
It's known that some drivers do not compile and marked in the Kconfig 
files. But if you choose to try to compile them anyway, they don't 
compile.
