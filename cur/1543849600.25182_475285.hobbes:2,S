Out of curiosity, did you check the UPS logs? The low- (and mid- ?)
range ones I've played with have logs as well as the ability to tell
the computer when there is a power problem. I'd check those logs and
also look in the system BIOS for a way to power the computer back on
when power returns. If it was powered off, I don't believe it would be
kernel-related.
I could always be wrong, but from my own experiences kernel problems
result in a system that is on but not operational.
