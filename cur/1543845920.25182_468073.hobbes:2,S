Subject: [patch 06/23] time: fix timeout overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
prevent timeout overflow if timer ticks are behind jiffies (due to high
softirq load or due to dyntick), by limiting the valid timeout range
to MAX_LONG/2.
