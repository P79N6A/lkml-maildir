Yes, we wouldn't be worrying much about DEBUG_SPINLOCK enlarging struct
page (unnecessary as that currently is): it's the PREEMPT case adding
break_lock that's of concern (and only on 32-bit, I think: on all the
64-bits we'd have two unsigned ints in unsigned long private).
Going the union way doesn't give any more guarantee that another level
isn't using the fields, than the overlay way I did.  Going the union
way, without enlarging the common struct page, seems to involve either
lots of abstraction edits all over the tree (break_lock coinciding with
with page->mapping on 32-bit), or ruling out gcc 2.95.  Either seems to
me like a lose with no real win.
I'm certainly not arguing against break_lock itself: it's one of the
reasons why I went for a proper spinlock_t there; and agree with you
that trying to squeeze it in with the lock would likely go deep into
architectural complications.
