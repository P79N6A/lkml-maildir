Subject: test8-pre4: innd fixed?

Could people who have seen the innd active list file corruption thing
please try out linux-2.4.0-test8-pre4? Despite some reports, it was _not_
fixed in pre2, and pre3 was a internal-only test to fix the remaining
issue with Al Viro.
pre4 finally passes all my truncate() tests, and the code looks good. The
only thing left to verify is whether innd really is happy, or whether the
inactive file corruption may have been due to something else altogether.
I'm personally fairly optimistic, but this needs to be verified so that
everybody can either breathe a sigh of relief or go looking for "the final
bug".
Note that reiserfs is reported to have the same bug, and pre4 won't have
fixed that - only ext2. The infrastructure is all in place so that the
reiserfs fix is probably a one-liner, but for now I just want to hear from
people who have their news-spools and active file on an ext2 filesystem.

----
test8:
 - pre1
    - Oops. Moved back stallion.c to drivers/char. It's not a TV driver.
      Never has been, and I don't see it ever really becoming one ;)
    - mca.c: outp_b() should be outb_p().  Obviously nobody actually
      _uses_ the MCA bus any more ;)
    - umsdos should be ok again after the page_address() type-changes.
    - re-enable asynchronous read-ahead code.
    - Sun ESP driver update
    - netfilter debug fixes
    - IPv6 needs to register before proto_init()
    - socket() error code fix (EAFNOSUPPORT instead of EINVAL)
    - potential TCP socket leak fix
    - don't self-deadlock on the kbd_controller_lock when probing for the mouse
    - CONFIG_SMB_NLS_REMOTE didn't work. Silly typo.
    - scheduler wakeup race condition could cause delayed scheduling on SMP..
    - net/packet/af_packet.c: use the standard macros for marking page resevredness
    - ncpfs buffer-overflow fix
    - thread groups, take 1.
    - USB storage driver update
 - pre2
    - The TCP socket leak patch _really_ went in this time.
    - get rid of more suser() checks in networking.. It's "capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)".
    - sparc updates
    - alpha updates. Fast alpha xor for raid. AP1000 updates.
    - Wonders never cease. digiboard driver updates. Christoph Lameter is BAAACK!
    - SiS frame buffer driver updates. Can be used without a BIOS.
    - nfsd interface cleanup.
    - fix potential buffer overruns in get_partition_list.  Remove
      limitation of one page. 
    - floppy driver capability cleanups. Use "request_region()".
    - handle dcache flushing when there are shared user mappings that
      may be dirty. 
    - get rid of the "xxxx_ret()" user access macros. They are more complex than
      just doing the return directly and they hide what's going on.
    - fix up broken BIOSes that don't give unique ID's to different APICs
    - make more of the drm drivers compile on other platforms and know
      about the signal blocking issues.
    - net/atm/mpoa_proc.c: user-space access thinko
    - pcmcia: David Hinds: merge updates from 3.1.20
    - pcmcia: non-ISA machines really shouldn't use ISA interrupts ;)
    - ext2: truncate races and error code return fixes
    - true shared signals for pthreads..
 - pre3:
    - ext2: final truncate piece - fix the innd problem.
    - use "sfence" for x86 memory barrier when available.
    - remove the thread-group signal code for now: no feedback.
      Leave the cleanups in place so that we can add it back in
      cleanly later, but remove the new features.
    - ARM update.
    - released for Al Viro to check the truncate thing
 - pre4:
    - truncate really fixed this time. Everybody agrees.
