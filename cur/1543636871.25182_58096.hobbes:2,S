Mostly resyncing with the various trees that have sprouted in
the last week, and applying obvious stuff that didn't take much thinking.
Syncing with 4 new releases is no small feat, so this patchset is
*mostly* just a standing still release.
I'll start digging through the *huge* backlog of patches next time.
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.27 vanilla is available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/
Merged patch archive: 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/patches/merged/
Check 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Linux-2.5.html
 before reporting
known bugs that are also in mainline.
