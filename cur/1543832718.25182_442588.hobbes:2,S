Correcting myself: vga_wseq() is not a problem in little endian machines
because the 2 single-byte writes are done with a single 2-byte write.
vga_rseq() is not safe though.
I don't know how big a problem this is, reading the i2c bus while the
video mode is changing..., but I agree that it might be worthwhile
to at least lock sequencer access.
