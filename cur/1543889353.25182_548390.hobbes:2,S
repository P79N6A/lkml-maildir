Well theoretically for just sizing BARs, turning off the MEM bit should 
be fine, since your next accesses should only be to config space until 
the MEM bit is reenabled.  But if RAM accesses really are disabled, 
then you'd better be sure all the code you need is already in cache, or 
you'll get into trouble.
So yeah, I guess special handling for host bridges is needed, but that 
doesn't seem like a big deal.

What do you mean?  You set it up the normal way, by poking at config 
space to see what's there, then size the BARs (disabling mem and I/O 
accesses in PCI_COMMAND shouldn't affect config space cycles afaik).  
You just have to be careful to disable decoding for I/O and memory 
regions, especially if your mmconfig space overlaps with what the 
devices end up with in their BARs.  Which is why my initial patch works 
ok (because fortunately the Intel host bridges hard code the mem decode 
bit to 1 too).
