Why did you omit the next paragraph (which completes the story):
"We have attempted to reduce the inconvenience of binary-only drivers by 
separating the proprietary code from the operating-system specific code. 
The latter is provided in source form, allowing users to install the 
drivers under any supported version (2.4 or later) of the Linux kernel."
