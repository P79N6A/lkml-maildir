My aio patches already have a poll operation, however it acts as a one shot 
operation: an async poll does not complete until the state indicates 
readiness or it is cancelled.  That's needed as there is a 1-1 relationship 
between submitted aio operations and the space in the completion ring.  Still, 
it looks like it will work quite nicely as a means of accelerating exiting 
poll() based servers.
