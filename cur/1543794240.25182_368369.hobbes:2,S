I'm looking at this now. PPC, IA64 and parisc have something like
this, as well as x86-64 with my patch applied. The others either have
dma_ops with completely different semantics or choose the dma ops
implementation at compile time. However, each arch needs a slightly
different definition of dma_mapping_ops - I'm not sure having one
definition catering to all archs is better than what we have now,
considering the DMA mapping implementation is inherently arch
specific.
Cheers,
