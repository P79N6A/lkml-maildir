What about ops that return loff_t (64 bits) on 32-bit arches and stuff
it into 2 registers....
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/errno.h>
static long return_EIO(void)
{
        return -EIO;
}
#define EIO_ERROR ((void *) (return_EIO))
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
        loff_t error;
        loff_t (*fn_ptr) (int);
        fn_ptr = EIO_ERROR;
        error = fn_ptr(0);
        printf("and... error is %lld\n", error);
        return 0;
}
[root]# ./ssize_eio
and... error is 8589934587
[root]# uname -m
i686
I'm still not convinced that this is the best place to be clever :)
