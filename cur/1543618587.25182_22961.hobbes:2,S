Somewhere a long way down the "ACPI troubles (Was:[...]" thread someone 
told me, that the Asus A7V family is broken and implement the power-off 
funtion in a wrong manner. You have to update ACPI to make it work (but 
now it works like a charm). You should be able to find the links in the 
other thread.
