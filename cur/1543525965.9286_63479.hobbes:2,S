Now three.  The following is meticulously hand-copied from the
console before rebooting (please forgive any errors in transcription).
I hope it provides some clues:
aha1542.c: Unable to abort command for target 0
aha1542.c: Trying device reset for target 0
aha1542_out failed(2): aha1542.c: Unable to abort command for target 0
sent BUS RESET to scsi host 0
scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:01, sector 539770
... more errors like this ...
Ext2-fs error (device sd(8,1)): ext2_write_inode: Unable to read
