My mistake.  It's 4.5, not 4.51 (sorry for the misinformation).

Lets see... I typically have two or three windows open, one or two for
browsing, one for news (though lately I've been going back to using Tin).
I don't read my mail through netscape.  I use elm.  I'm not impressed
with any of the graphic mail readers available, let alone Netscape mail
reader.  The same argument applies to news readers, so I guess recently
it's only been browsing.  But in the past it's been all three.  As for
the types of pages, I visit, they vary from straight HTML (text only) to
sites heavy on the java.  It's a pretty good mix.  My disk and memory
caches are 5Mb each, and I know I exceed that limit at least once a day.
