The current map_user_kiobuf() doesn't have an 'mm' parameter, I can only
use it from the context of the writer.
I could use map_user_kiobuf_mm(), but the kiobuf structure is far too
large, I really don't want a huge structure (> 8 kB?) for a simple 4 kB
single copy transfer.
Including a memset(,0,sizeof(*iobuf) in kiobuf_init().
I think reusing the ptrace interface (access_process_vm()) is the better
solution.
