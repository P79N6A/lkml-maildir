The obvious solution is to continue the way Richard Stallman envisaged:
***Distribute all code in source form only - no binary distributions.***
This way, the source files are protected under freedom of speech rules and
the originator of the work is safe.
It is then up to the user to do with the code what he/she wants.
I think that while many people think that Richard is paranoid, he actually
was far more prophetic than most people wants to give him credit for...
Cheers,
