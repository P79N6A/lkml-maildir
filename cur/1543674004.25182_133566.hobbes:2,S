No, Andreas' bug is different. He obviously built APM as a module,
and apparently the save and restore processor state procedures in
suspend.c aren't EXPORT_SYMBOL()d. I never build APM as a module
so I didn't notice this in my testing.
Workarounds: configure APM non-modular, or add EXPORT_SYMBOL()
for {save,restore}_processor_state somewhere in arch/i386/kernel/.
I'll whip up a proper patch with the EXPORT_SYMBOL()s tomorrow.
