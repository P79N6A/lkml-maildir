I'm not sure I understand you. You said that voluntary preempt and 
preempt look the same yet in your last line you say voluntary preempt 
allows you to move away from 2.4.26?
Anyway apart from that comment I'm not really sure how you can address 
this because if nice +19 works at smoothing out the games then that 
almost surely suggests a yield() implementation in your games. 
Unfortunately this, I noticed while coding my new scheduler policy, 
seems to be _very_ common. There were lots of "big name" new games that 
did the same thing. It was decided quite a while back in 2.5 development 
that applications that use yield() for locking were broken by design. If 
nice +19 fixes the problem then all I can suggest for the time being is 
to use nice +19. The fact that the current processor is much more 
out-of-order in it's scheduling is what is fooling these applications 
now, and their unfortunate programming suffers in that setting.
What you need to cope with this is gang scheduling, but that's absurd to 
implement such a complicated policy to cope with poor application 
coding. Gang may be implemented in the future for different reasons, though.
