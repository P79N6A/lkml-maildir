Besides the obvious removal of code?
The old way actually made an effort to create per_cpu tasklets!  So that
the tasklets *can* run simultaneously, making it in essense a softirq.
Since tasklets are implemented by the softirq, with a lot of code to make
a tasklet function run only on one CPU at a time, and it can run on any
CPU.  By converting the rcu tasklet (which had work to make it act like a
softirq) to just be a softirq, we removed all the extra overhead of a
tasklet.
But to answer your question.  No, I didn't take any actual measurements.
The changes just seemed obvious to me (and others).
