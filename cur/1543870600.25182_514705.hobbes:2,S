Hi,
the RSS thing is.. .funky.
I'm saying that because we have not been able to define what RSS means,
so before we expand how RSS is used that needs solving first.
This is relevant for the pagetable sharing patches: if RSS can exclude
shared, they're relatively easy. If RSS has to include shared always, we
have currently a problem because hugepages aren't part of RSS right now.
I would really really really like to see this unclarity sorted out on
the concept level before going through massive changes in the code based
on something so fundamentally unclear.
