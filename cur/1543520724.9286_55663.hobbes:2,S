Thanks for your response.
The following modules are all present in /lib/modules/2.3.35/usb:
	ezusb.o  scanner.o  usb-uhci.o  usbcore.o
depmod -ae does not bug me a modules.dep file with any USB entries in
it.
I don't think anything is asking for the modules to be loaded 
yet, since I haven't attached my scanner.  Nowever, running modprobe
on each of the usb modules results in errors like these:
	modprobe usbcore.o 
	can't locate module usbcore.o
I don't have any USB related entries in my conf.modules file yet.
I haven't gotten to the stage of entering my scanner's indentification
values there yet (it's an Epson Perfection 636U).
