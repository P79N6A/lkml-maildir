Well, I suppose whatever geometry you invent will make no difference at all.
Roughly speaking, Linux does not use any geometry.
Also, the geometry change you refer to is old, not something that happened
during 2.6.
Since reading the partition table is the very first thing that happens
on the disk, any kind of IDE problem will cause problems reading the pt
Check whether you can read that disk using dd.
Check that fdisk still can read the table on that disk.
Go back to 2.6.6 and check that the pt table is still OK.
Check what type it is, and that your 2.6.7 kernel still has
configured that type.
