Not every case causes a panic either.  This week, I had an instance of
an i686 box lock solid with a DFE-530TX net card.  Rebooting/power
cycling it didn't recover it (despite it working for the past month
without any problems).  It only started working again after I moved
it into a different PCI slot.
I've seen a couple of instances now on totally different hardware where
it is possible to lock a PCI bus solid by improper connections on some
of the PCI bus lines, so a faulty PCI socket seem to be the most likely
cause.
In this case, a "panic" doesn't help you; the machine experiances a
hardware lockup.  To catch these, you'd need a hardware watchdog.
What I'm basically saying is that there is only a limited amount that
Linux (or any OS) can do against these types of hardware failure.  If
you need better protection, try a hardware with user-space policy
implementations.
