You apparently made the mistake of looking at character count < 80, not
lines that extend past column 80.
For 2.6.3-mm1, I see:
[/usr/src/linux-2.6.3-mm1/arch/i386]2 find . -name '*.c' | xargs cat | wc -l
  64542
[/usr/src/linux-2.6.3-mm1/arch/i386]2 find . -name '*.c' | xargs cat | awk 'length() > 80 { print $0}' | wc -l
    477
[/usr/src/linux-2.6.3-mm1/arch/i386]2 find . -name '*.c' | xargs cat |sed 's/\t/        /g'| awk 'length() > 80 { print $0}' | wc -l
   1291
(replace \t with whatever your shell needs to enter a literal tab .  Yes, this
botches on the relatively rare line that has an embedded tab. Deal with it. ;).
In other words, the situation is a lot worse if you count columns, not
characters.
(For IA64, it's 67,376 and either 1,185 or 3,222, and for drivers/net I see
493,027 and either 4,004 or 15,606 - ia64 is worse at the 80-col thing either way)
