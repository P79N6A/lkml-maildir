I enabled CONFIG_USB??? and built the usb-uhci module. I can modprobe it and it detects my mouse (according to SIGUSR1 on uhci-control), but I can't get any data from reading /dev/usbmouse (c 10 32). I also can't open the mouse until I kill -USR1 uhci-control. The interrupt service registers itself in /proc/interrupts (IO-APIC-edge, irq11), but the interrupt counters never increment.
This is because USR1 causes uhci-control to wakeup and poll the ports
and notice something has happened.

What kind of UHCI controller is it? Could you show me a lspci output?
Also, are there any USB or PnP settings in your BIOS? Does changing the
setting cause it to work?
