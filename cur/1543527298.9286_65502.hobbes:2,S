    This is sort of pointless when you're talking about floppies -- in
    most cases, floppies are simply low-capacity random-access tape
    drives, and the user would prefer that the OS writes the data to the
    disk *right now* instead of waiting around for it to schedule it.
    My hat is off to the people who actually run Linux from a floppy
    disk (I've done it, back when kernels were small enough to actually
    fit an installer on a uncompressed floppy filesystem.  I'm sure it
    was faster to buffer writes, but it was still r-e-a-l-l-y slow.)
    but I don't think they're anywhere close to the majority.

    david parsons \bi/    Magicfilter is pretty q00l, but I wish it would
                   \/  unlock the door of the %^$#!@@ cd-rom occasionally.
