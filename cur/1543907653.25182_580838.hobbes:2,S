Martin, at least irpoll should have worked. I am assuming your timer
interrupts are coming in second kernel. In that case we are not
dependent at all on actually receiving device interrupt. Polling should
take care of it.
What is that device which is not working? What is the success criterion?
I mean, did you check that the irq handler of your driver is now invoked
with irqpoll and now it can drive the device without worrying about
LAPIC and IOAPIC settings?
Thanks
Vivek
