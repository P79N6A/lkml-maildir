I assume you mean the fallback validation fix. Linus unfortunately
didn't merge any of my new patches yet :/
But did you ever work out why the stack backtrace completely restarted? 
I never got this. In theory the RSP gotten out of the unwind
context and used for the fallback should have been already near the end
and the old unwinder shouldn't have found much.

P.S.: Badari, we worked out your kernel_math_context trace too:
that one is actually a gcc bug related to dubious unwind tables generated
for noreturn calls (in your case do_exit). We were still discussing the best 
workaround for that one.
