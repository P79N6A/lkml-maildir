Yeah, that's correct.
Here is the panic + trace with a vanilla kernel (no vserver patch):
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempting to free lock with active block list
 [<c011aa15>] panic+0x55/0xe0
 [<c0168277>] fcntl_setlk64+0x137/0x2d0
 [<c010c5ac>] restore_i387_fxsave+0xac/0xb0
 [<c010c64d>] restore_i387+0x9d/0xa0
 [<c0151cd9>] fget+0x49/0x60
 [<c01635eb>] sys_fcntl64+0x4b/0xa0
 [<c010427f>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
The panic seems to be caused by a proftpd version 1.2.9 on a Debian
Sarge. The whole distribution is mounted over NFS and both client and
server are using the 2.6.9-rc4 kernel version.
The proftpd configuration isn't that unusual except that a directory
is mounted rbinded but it doesn't seem to be the problem because I get
the same panic without it. I can provide the proftpd configuration if
needed it.
Let me know if you need some more information.
