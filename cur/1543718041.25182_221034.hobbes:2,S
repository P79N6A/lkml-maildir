AFAICT, none has been merged (yet).

An initrd might do the trick, although it's sometimes unconvenient to use :
- lilo (or grub) loads the initrd into memory
- lilo (or grub) loads the kernel and executes it
- the kernel sees the initrd and mounts it and executes /linuxrc
- linuxrc can load USB modules and wait the required amount of time
- linuxrc then mounts the root fs and does the pivot_root() and exits
- the kernel finally boots /sbin/init from your USB FS.

Willy
