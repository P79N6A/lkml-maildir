If it breaks here (due to your ports being "embraced and extended") it
could well break elsewhere, and wrapping it in CONFIG_ARM doesn't solve
that.
I'm not sure what the solution to this is, but unless we can autodetect
the port "type", it rather screws the current direction of 8250, which
has been to move away from port types to a set of port capabilities.
I wonder if its possible to get hold of any documentation for your
misdetected serial port...
