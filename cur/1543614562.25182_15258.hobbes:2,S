People in general *don't* understand the current so-called "established  
practice", because not only is it inconsistent with all of the rest of the

I have no idea why you think it is impossible to get right. It is fairly  
easy to get right. Of course, that means using different numbers, but then  
I've been saying for more than a decade that those numbers are a lie.
