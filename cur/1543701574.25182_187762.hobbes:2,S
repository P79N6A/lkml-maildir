Yes and even worse, if you stop running setiathome the scientific task 
*still* only gets half the available CPU!
The difference is that with HT running a task on one sibling actually 
does (or can) slow the other. That's not true with true SMP, at least 
not directly, since the resourses shared (memory and disk) are much 
farther away from the CPU.
