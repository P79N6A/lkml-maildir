Their ML seems to only receive patches from people. There's usually no

I am far from qualified to comment on this, but from a users point of view, is 
it possible to not have laptop specific code in the kernel?
I have had two Linux laptops and with both I had ACPI issues.
The vendors of both laptops (Toshiba Tecra S1 and now an Asus W3V) don't seem 
to be following standards. With both I seem to need to patch ACPI to get 
various functions of the laptop to work.
I would love to see laptop specific functionality definitions exist outside 
the kernel.

Would you mind if I add mine? 
It adds support for W3000 (W3V) and indirectly fixes an issue with kmilo under 
KDE (it was triggering excessive LCD read error messages by querying 
asus_acpi module) allowing people (I am probably the only one who tested 
this) with W3000 to run kmilo.  
The patch is against gentoo-sources-2.6.16-r3 (I believe this corresponds to 
vanilla sources 2.6.16.9 and I don't think gentoo-sources applied any other 
patches against the vanilla asus-acpi.c).
