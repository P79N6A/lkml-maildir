I'm still not sure, what your problem is.
With the v3 of the usermounts patchset, by default, user mounts are
disabled, because the "allow unpriv submounts" flag is cleared on all
mounts.
There are several options available to sysadmins and distro builders
to enable user mounts in a secure way:
  - pam module, which creates a private namespace, and sets "allow
    unpriv submounts" on the mounts within the namespace
  - pam module, which rbinds / onto /mnt/ns/$USER, and chroots into
    /mnt/ns/$USER, then sets the "allow unpriv submounts" on the
    mounts under /mnt/ns/$USER.
  - sysadmin creates /mnt/usermounts writable to all users, with
    sticky bit (same as /tmp), does "mount --bind /mnt/usermounts
    /mnt/usermounts" and sets the "allow unpriv submounts" on
    /mnt/usermounts.
All of these are perfectly safe wrt userdel and backup (assuming it
doesn't try back up /mnt).
