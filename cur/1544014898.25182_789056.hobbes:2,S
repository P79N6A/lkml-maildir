Folks,
You are not correct. The kernel software clock variable is in fact 
stepped back, but the routine that actually reads the clock does not 
step the clock back unless set back more than two seconds.. Otherwise, 
the clock is strictly monotonic. That is the ad vice I gave in rfc1583 
and implemented the Digital Unix kernel because I wrote tthe code. Other 
kernelmongers might or might not have taken the advice.
As for the TAI issue discussed earlier, note that the generic NTP kernel 
supportfrom me since 1991  has TAI . However, support to read it 
requires the ntp_gettime()  syscall and nlot all kernels support it.
The recent leap was observed to work correctly in Solaris and FreeBSD. 
It worked fine with the WWV driver and the Spectracom GPS driver, but 
not the NMEA, Arbiter, Meinberg nor any of the NIST or USNO primary 
servers. It probably did work with the Canadian servers, since the 
Ottowa primary server is synchronized via my CHU audio driver. It didn't 
work onn my carefully contrived backroom servers, as they lost power 
durring the event.
See  www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/leap.html and/or the online NTP 
documentation and/or my book.
