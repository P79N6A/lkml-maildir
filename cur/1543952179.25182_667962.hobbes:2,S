The following command will pull in all the dependencies you need for
building -intel:

If you're having troubles while the splash screen is displayed, you may
want to look at / fiddle with the settings in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf.
Also have a look in /etc/gdm/, where the Init, PreSession, and
PostSession scripts are located.  Those are additional places where
scripts can be tied in during this early startup phase.  (I don't know
if that would actually be of use here though.)
