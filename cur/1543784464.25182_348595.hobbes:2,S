They could be but I would rather not.  What if one day I decide to
change how ntfs_malloc_nofs() works?  Then it would be needed to
carefully go through the whole driver looking for places where kmalloc
is used and change those, too.
>From a software design point of view you should never mix interfaces
when accessing an object if you want clean and maintainable code.  And
using kmalloc() sometimes and ntfs_malloc_nofs() at other times for the
same object would violate that.
The wrapper is a static inline so I would assume gcc can optimize away
everything when a constant size is passed in like in the example you
point out above.
