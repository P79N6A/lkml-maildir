Mine was actually out of a stock 2.2.17 -- I tried your patch in an attempt
to fix a disk problem - but the disk was just going bad and the slow speeds were
coming from the automatic sector remapping.  
pardon my ignorance, but where do you get UDMA-100-66?
Here is the hdparm -i output on 2.4:
/dev/hda:
 Model=IBM-DARA-225000, FwRev=SHAOA54A, SerialNo=SQASQ202564
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
 RawCHS=16383/16/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=4
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=418kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=off
 DblWordIO=no, OldPIO=2, DMA=yes, OldDMA=2
 CurCHS=17475/15/63, CurSects=16513875, LBA=yes, LBAsects=49577472
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:240,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4
 UDMA modes: mode0 mode1 *mode2 mode3 mode4
 Drive Supports : ATA/ATAPI-4 T13 1153D revision 17 : ATA-1 ATA-2 ATA-3 ATA-4 
UDMA mode (2) seems to be identical to before.
