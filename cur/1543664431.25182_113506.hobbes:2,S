|The Generic Address Structure (GAS) is basically a 64 bit address and a
|type field. The type can be:
|
|System memory
|System IO
|PCI Config space
|Embedded Controller
|SMBus
|Functional fixed hardware
|
|I don't think this will very easily handle a clean request/release API.
|Corey, what is the specific table you are concerned with? At least with
|the GASes ACPI uses internally, they point to resource regions already
|marked as used via other means (e820 or _CRS, for example.)
This is for some IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) hardware.
It's address is specified in an ACPI table.
