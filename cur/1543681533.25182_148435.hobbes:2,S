I would like to see HT_ONLY generalized to parsing the MADT for
I/O-APICs. The problem I have is that some mainboards, like my
i850 ASUS P4T-E, have I/O-APICs but no MP tables. The only way for
the Linux kernel to discover the I/O-APICs on these mainboard is
through MADT parsing.
However, this currently requires me to enable all of ACPI, which
I don't need or want for many reasons, including code bloat and
behavioural side-effects.
Replacing "HT_ONLY" with "MADT_PARSING_ONLY" would be ideal, IMO.
