If you can boot DOS or FREE dos on your system, see if the disk
emulation implimented the format-unit command. You can do it with
debug...
- mov dx, 81	; 81 is D: , 80 is C:
- mov cx, 0	; Start at cylinder 0
- mov ah, 7	; Format unit command
- int 13	; BIOS hard-disk service
- int 3		; Catch after call
If the call returned with CY not set and the command took some time
it is likely that new sectors were written and all is well.
