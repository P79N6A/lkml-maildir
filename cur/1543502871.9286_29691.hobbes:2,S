That is what I expected to hear, isn't it easier to prevent resource
contention if there is one set of resources then if you have two
overlapping sets? I realize that in the short term this may be harder to
do becouse you need to change more drivers, but it seems obviously more
"correct" a solution.
what am I mising?

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
