  Thanks ...
  The pure ALSA system with PCI Cirrus Logic CS4281
  (my configuration) just dropped of my list of
  the 'bad' one ....
  Does this bug freeze the machine ? Or just block
  the outputting program ?
  PCM will be the next to look at...
  +-compile->reboot->check->-+

  Kind of feel like in the old days where
  a decend 'printf(stderr,....)' was THE
  state of the art debugging tool ....
  Cheers
