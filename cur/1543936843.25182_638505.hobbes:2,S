OK, thanks.  Then I'll queue this clean-up patch to ALSA tree.

There are three patches.
- Ingo's patch to reduce latency.  This was applied after rc6, and
  reverted after rc7.
- My first test patch
- My second test patch (clean-up patch you tested lastly)

No, the second argument of git-clone is the destination directory to 
clone, not the branch to pick up.  The cloned repo has all branches
but doesn't point mm branch.
And, Linus and ALSA git trees are likely out of sync.
