this is right. OTOH, I'd like to keep the assembler code tiny. At the
moment, it's nearly 2kB in the last release (you can consult messages
on screen, scroll up/down, export them to a printer, choose printer,
drive and format, and of course save to the floppy). Linus once said
to me that it wasn't good to add lots of assembler code to the kernel
because people can't maintain it easily. Moreover, I have some difficulties
at merging 16-bits code with 32-bits ; to avoid these issues, I have to
make all addresses relative to the begining of the code, which makes it
awful ! I'm nearly about to get back to as86 instead of gas, and to write
a tool to generate a .c file from the binary. I've looked at "build.c" in
the kernel tree and "tools.c" from dosemu. They're both interesting, but
don't exactly meet my needs, so I think the better choice will be to
convert the "kmsgdump.o" to "static char ..." in a new "kmsgdump.c".
Once I get all this fixed, I'll investigate more into all possibilities
that FAT offers, keeping compatibility with DOS (eg: DOS doesn't support
a number of FATs different than 2).
I was once asked to reserve some space on an EXT2 FS, and use an absolute
pointer to it as a dump offset. Although this might allow to read messages
from a running kernel without a diskette, risks of FS corruption scares me.
What about CHS/LBA, bios driver numbering ? and if the file is
moved/deleted... Or we could mark the file as "immutable" at the EXT2
level, but I find this risky too.
I think that at first, I'll focus on the new release, and not much more.
Later, I'll see what people think they really need after they used it.
