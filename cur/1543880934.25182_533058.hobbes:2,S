  Because UDF had some flaws and user could crash a kernel with larger
filesize. In -mm kernel are patches fixing the flaw and also raising the
limit back to MAX_LFS_FILESIZE.

  Bad things can happen only if you set it to more than
MAX_LFS_FILESIZE. With smaller values only users are disappointed ;).
