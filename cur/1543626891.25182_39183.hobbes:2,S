And your suggestion is useless because disk will be up all the time on
the system...

...which is usefull, OTOH. If you have laptop with battery and
suspend-to-disk capability in BIOS when battery goes low, you can
cache for *long* time.

Hah, so you can never spindown because /var/log/syslog is opened for
