That's not a gcc bug (gcc is doing the right thing). It's the kernel that
should use the "memory" clobber in the spinlock implementation.
The sad code generated was in reality the _right_ code. I was blind not
noticing the missing $ (I missed it the first time in the first testcase I
tried and I kept missing it, I was probably also biased assuming the current
spinlocks was safe with the commonly used compilers, I was thinking to fix only
a theorical bug). I'm sorry for that (and thanks again to Richard and Jamie).
