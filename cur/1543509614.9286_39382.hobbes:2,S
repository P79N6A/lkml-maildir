Hello,
	i installed the kernel 2.2.12 on my machine but the kernel didn't boot
since it has problem with the cdrom drive,here's the error message i'm
getting:
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: cdrom_pc_intr: the drive appears confused (ireason= 0x 1)
and the error message goes on and on,the kernel is configured with
modules support but with every driver compiled in,the only module i have
is the alsa driver for my SB awe64.
here's my machine spec:
P100 on a intel triton motherboard,32 MB of ram
hard drive is a quantum fireball EX6.4,primary master
CD drive is an Asus S360 (36x) atapi,secondary master,there was no CD in
the drive at bootup but sometime,i had an audio cd in.
the machine work fine with kernel 2.0.38 but i need a 2.2.XX kernel to
run the alsa driver,i'm also getting another error when booting 2.2.12:
