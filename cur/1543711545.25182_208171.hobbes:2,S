Okay, so we've got these pinned down. So I've got two small ideas
(I mentioned them earlier, but maybe vger dropped the message):
(a) I think prefaulting should work for that in general, though the API
doesn't fit the extra things needed for e.g. DMA. Is there some way we
could extend remap_area_pages() (or provide an alternative interface to
similar functionality with the missing pieces included) to do the extra
things needed to make the coherency and/or DMA (or whatever else is
missing) work?
(b) Alternatively, would dma_coherent_to_pfn() instead of
dma_coherent_to_page() and making ->nopage() return pfns help salvage
the method using non-cachable and/or dma-coherent page protections in
vma->vm_page_prot?
