That is solvable by shutting down remote operations first.
So stop samba (or nfs or whatever) before attempting to umount.

I don't know, other than researching what filesystems support
forced umount and use one of those. Complain to the vendor or maintainer
of your particular filesystem.
However, you can usually find out why some file is open. Try
umount yourself, when it doesn't work, use "lsof" to see
what file is open. Then figure out who or what is keeping it open.
To debug a shutdown problem, consider putting "lsof >> logfile"
in your shutdown script.
Not a solution but a workaround: Run "sync" before shutdown.
(Stick it in some script.)
Now, all data in filesystem caches will be written to disk before power 
is lost.
This isn't perfect, but filesystem damage is greatly minimized and
often avoided completely.  Useful while waiting for a better solution.
The real solution is to set things up so unforced umount works.
This is normally possible to do.
