Trond, et al.
You're right, it's a driver (ns83820) issue.  Strange that it only shows up
when trying to execute an app that's mounted via NFS, but, whatever. 
Running apps from the the NFS volumes with the eepro100 adapter that's on
the machine works fine with the updated NFS_all patch applied.
Thanks, again,
Dan
