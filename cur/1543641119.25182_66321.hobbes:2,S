Can we have a asm/sched.h instead?  especially if we might add additional
per-arch scheduler bits.  Also I think a asm-generic version is better than
linux/smp_balance.h + the ARCH_HAS_SMP_BALANCE hack.  I'd prefer if you
would move the #include ontop ot sched.c, too - includes in the middle of
a file are really messy.
