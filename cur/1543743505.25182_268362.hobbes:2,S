Quite often, the additional write is _faster_ in the non-error path.
If it's a plain register, the obvious code generation for the above is
		..
		testl error-condition
		je no_error
		movl $-XXX,%eax
		jmp out;
	no_error:
		...
which is a lot slower (for the common non-error case) than
		movl $-XXX,%eax
		testl error-condition
		jne out
because forward branches are usually predicted not-taken when no other 
prediction exists.
You can do the same thing with
	if (unlikely(error condition)) {
		err = -ERRORCODE;
		goto out;
	}
which is hopefully even better, but the fact is, the regular
	err = -ERRORCODE;
	if (error condition)
		goto out;
is just _smaller_ and simpler and quite often more readable anyway.
It has the added advantage that it tends to stylistically match what I 
consider the proper error return behaviour, ie
	err = function_returns_errno(...)
	if (err)
		goto out;
ie it looks syntactically identical when "error condition" and the error 
value happen to be one and the same. Which is, after all, _the_ most 
common case.
So I personally tend to prefer the simple format for several reasons. 
It's small, it's consistent, and it maps well to good code generation.
The code generation part ends up being nice when something goes wrong.  
When somebody sends in an oops, I often end up having to look at the
disassembly (and no, a fancy debugger wouldn't help - I'm talking about
the disassembly of the "code" portion of the oops itself, and matching it
up with the source tree - the oops doesn't come with the whole binary),
and then having code generation match the source makes things a _lot_
easier.
Does it make sense for other projects? Dunno. But it is, as you noted, a 
common idiom in the kernel. Getting used to it just makes it even more 
readable.
