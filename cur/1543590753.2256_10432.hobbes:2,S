hmm. while the technical issues of this situation are fairly interesting,
can i make a suggestion? if you're running out of swap every now and 
then, perhaps you need to use swapd (a userspace daemon, that adds
more swap from swapfiles as you need it, and recovers the space when
things become less pressing). that's much better than trying it by hand
when necessary. As you've noticed, we're all only human, and mistakes
can be made.
swapd: 
http://cvs.linux.hr/swapd/
as a side bonus, you get to keep that partition as a filesystem, and also
dedicate it to being the swapfile holder.
while this is a solution i'd never go in for (userspace is slightly more
fallible
than i like (which doesn't stop me from using devfsd) given the situation
swapd needs to act in), but it's better than doing it by hand, no?
