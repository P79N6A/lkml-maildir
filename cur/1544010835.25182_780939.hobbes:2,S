Correct. I have updated the comment.

Ok, it might look better.
[PATCH v2] hvc_console: escape magic sysrq key
From: Hendrik Brueckner <brueckner@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
The ctrl-o (^O) is a common control key used by several applications like vim.
To allow users to send ^O to the terminal, this patch introduces a check
if ^O is pressed again if the sysrq_pressed variable is already set.
In this case, clear sysrq_pressed state and flip the ^O character to the tty.
(The old behavior has always set "sysrq_pressed" if ^O has been entered, and it
has not flipped the ^O character to the tty.)
