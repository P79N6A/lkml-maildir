Subject: [PATCH] preemption latency measurement tool
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

preempt-stats, the preemption-off period measurement tool, has been
updated with new patches for 2.4.18, 2.4.19-pre6, 2.4.19-pre5-ac3,
2.5.7, and 2.5.8-pre2 available at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-stats
		and
	
http://tech9.net/rml/linux
A lot of work, courtesy of MontaVista, has gone into this release to
greatly improve the accuracy of the tool's measurements.
This patch instructs the kernel preemption code to measure periods of
non-preemptibility and report the 20 worst in /proc/latencytimes.  These
results typically correspond to the 20 longest held spinlocks in your
working kernel.  They help pinpoint specific problem areas that need
work.  Example results:
cpu 0 worst 20 latency times of 2236 measured in this period.
  usec      cause     mask   start line/file      address   end line/file
  9292        BKL        1  2839/buffer.c        c0142caf  2842/buffer.c
  5999  spin_lock        9    86/softirq.c       c011c56d   112/softirq.c
  4495  spin_lock        1   401/memory.c        c0126f18   422/memory.c
  2697  spin_lock        1   671/inode.c         c015658a   697/inode.c
  ... et cetera
The patch obviously requires a preemptive kernel.  For 2.4, the patches
are available at the above address.  Preempt-kernel is merged in 2.5.
