I remember reading at some point that a POWER4 could track at least 5+ parallel
streams.  I don't know how many K8 handles, but it is multiple too at least 
(forward and backwards)
I don't have more data, but at least the newer Intel CPUs seem to be also 
very good at prefetching and when you look at a die photo the L/S unit 
in general is quite big. More than 6 streams handled is certainly a 
possibility.
I guess it could be figured out with some clever benchmarking.

My gut feeling is that this is not enough.

Post it to the list please.
