i agree with that dana. Sure coding style is important but lets not get
personal here. I personally think there should be an established coding
style that should be kept to as much as possible but the way to implement
that is by helping the contributors to do so with tools etc, not by
castigating them in a "hall of shame". Isn't open source about inclusion and
creativity?
Just my opinion.

Any chance that you guys could calm down a bit?
I bet the guys in Redmond who were referred to
earlier are enjoying it, but it's just trash for
the rest of us....

This one I understood though :
Al made a personal attack.  He defended against the attack,
and preluded his defence with a disclaimer.
This issue has gone beyond productivity to personal name calling
and spurious defence.  Can we all just move on a bit maybe?
Thanks
