Dunno what they're called, but I'm using Gentoo Linux, which has 
reached 4.3.0-3.2.0 in terms of ATI fglrx drivers.  The tarball can be 
downloaded from Gentoo mirrors, but apparently not from ATI themselves.
That version compiles and works with 2.6, although I'm seeing some 
unclean behaviour that really should be fixed.
I'm copying this to the list, because this is at least the second 
request I've had on this subject.
