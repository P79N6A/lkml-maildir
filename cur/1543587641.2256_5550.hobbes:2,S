I _think_ cpu_logical_map() can be deleted from the kernel, and all
places that use it can just use the [0 ... (smp_num_cpus-1)] number.
This is for the generic kernel code. The only place that should need
to convert from this number space to a "physical" space would be the
intercpu interrupt code (arch specific code). 
Only a handful of architectures (mips64, sparc*, alpha) do array
lookups for cpu_logical_map() anyway, those probably can be changed 
to the x86 definition of cpu_logical_map().
