Incremental i2c-mpc driver fix for multi-master i2c busses.
This is an incremental bugfix for the i2c-mpc driver. It is based
on the bugfix I've sent on 2008-12-22:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/22/99
There still was a remaining problem with multi-master i2c busses
when an i2c bus access is interrupted by a unix signal while
waiting for bus arbitration.
This is an extreamly rare case but I managed to stumble over it in
multi master i2c performance tests.
Tested with a freescale MPC8349E host cpu.

The great thing about Object Oriented code is that it can make small,
simple problems look like large, complex ones.
