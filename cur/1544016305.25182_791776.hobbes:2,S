This sort of thing only makes sense if you include the topic branch for
the tree in question. While it is true that ftrace development happens in
this tree, people looking at ftrace may not want to sort through the
hundreds of unrelated topic branches in the process. I say this as
someone that does not want to sort through hundreds of unrelated topic
branches in search of ftrace code ;-)
