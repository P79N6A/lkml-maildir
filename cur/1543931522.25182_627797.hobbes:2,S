Likewise struct pid is designed not to be a problem if pinned. It is a
little heavier then it used to be with the addition of pid namespace
support but not much.  And if it is to heavy struct pid needs to be
fixed.
Holding the struct pid very much does not pin the task struct, and it
shouldn't pin any other resources.  I agree 64bytes or so is a bit
more to pin then 4 bytes but it really isn't a lot.

Yes.  Clearly I haven't tested it yet.
