I think you'll find that even on modern architectures cross-cacheline
writes aren't atomic.
Anyway, disregard the bit I mentioned about one byte longer; I've been
staring myself too blind at instruction variants lately (lots of
arguments about how to generate various instructions using NASM syntax).

If gas generates the C7 opcodes by default, then that's a bug, nothing less.
