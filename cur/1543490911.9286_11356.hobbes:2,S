Hi !
There're some Linux machines here running Linux 2.2.4 (UP).
Since we were using 2.2.4 we got strange messages from the kernel for example :
Mar 25 08:30:10 oxygene kernel: ip_rt_advice: redirect to 192.188.244.13/00 dropped
Mar 25 08:34:10 oxygene kernel: ip_rt_advice: redirect to 192.188.244.13/00 dropped
Mar 25 08:35:16 oxygene kernel: ip_rt_advice: redirect to 206.190.74.245/00 dropped
Mar 25 08:29:59 hal2000 kernel: ip_rt_advice: redirect to 193.6.34.14/10 dropped
What are these and why ?
Thanks : Gabor,
