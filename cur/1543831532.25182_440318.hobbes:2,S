Ok, I'll develop this in a cleaner way. But did you get the idea ? Let
me know if you think that this is something worthy to develop so I can
work on it. There are some details that I need to study about the USB
layer to get the whole picture so I can avoid redundant stuff.
I just think that it would be cool to be able to know the capabilities
of each device connected to our system, and who's better to tell us
that than the device drivers? =]
This way we can know, for example, that a webcam can do 30fps at
640x480 and the output type of the video, independently of which
webcam (and driver) we're using...
