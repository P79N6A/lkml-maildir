I see ;) But Petr, that is the maintainer for ncpfs has already answered,
please do what he asks you to do, as the above message is mostly related
to ncpfs than to IPX.
If the problem persists and you think that is IPX related, please let me
know and I'll take a look, but I haven't received other reports related to
what you describe here.
