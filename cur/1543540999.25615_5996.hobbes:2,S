Here's what various non-x86 boot directories use:
msb
rawbot
bootimage
bootpfile
srmboot
vmlinux.gz
ksize.h
vmlinux.nh
lxboot
bootlx
bootph
objstrip
mkbb
bootloader
bootpheader
Image
vmlinux.ecoff
elf2ecoff
addinitrd
mkboot
zvmlinux.initrd
sImage
zImage.initrd
zvmlinux
mkprep
iplfba.boot
ipleckd.boot
ipldump.boot
image
listing
tftpboot.img
piggyback
btfixupprep
I'm not sure how much sense some of these make, but most look pretty
