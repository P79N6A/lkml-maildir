OK, Dave and I went through this again, and we're both still confused.
Hopefully you still have the patience to keep explaining this to us ;-)
There must be something wrong here, otherwise we wouldn't get the
panic. It looks like the real problem here is to do with the page's count
rather than the locked stuff .... which fits in with the other panics Dave
has been seeing.

OK, I'd missed a whole bit here, which I now understand (or think I do ;-)). 
So truncate_list_pages does a page_cache_get(page), which increments 
the count. Nowhere does it decrement the count, or do an UnlockPage 
before it gets into page_cache_release, which looks like this:
void page_cache_release(struct page *page)
{
        if (!PageReserved(page) && put_page_testzero(page)) {
                if (PageLRU(page))
                        lru_cache_del(page);
                __free_pages_ok(page, 0);
        }
}
We enter page_cache_release with the supposedly locked, and its count
non-zero (we incremented it).  put_page_testzero does atomic_dec_and_test
on count which says it returns true if the result is 0, or false for all other cases.
So if nobody else was holding a reference to the page, we've decremented
it's count to 0, and put_page_testzero returns 1. We then try to free the page.
It's still locked. BUG.
John Stultz also pointed out that on return to the flow of truncate_list_pages
we call page_cache release again, which looks really odd. Something is 
wrong here .....

But that's all *after* we call truncate_complete_page, so it's
irrelevant, no ??
