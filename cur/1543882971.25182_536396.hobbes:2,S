For creating the snapshot alone, it doesn't matter.  Except that the restore is
cleaner a bit (we know exactly what all of these threads will be doing when
we restore the image and enable the IRQs after that).
Still, I think that kernel threads can potentailly hold locks accross the
freezing of devices and image creation and that is fishy.  Also I believe,
although I'm not 100% sure, that some of them may cause problems to
appear after we've created the image and while we are saving it.

Okay.  Accidentally, I'm working on a freezer patch, so I'll probably drop
the freezing of kernel threads from swsusp in it and we'll see what happens.
Let's do the experiment, shall we?

This was a mistake, quite unrelated to the point you're making.  And actually,
I was trying to fix a problem with two kernel threads that we thought might
submit I/O to disk after the image had been created.  Otherwise I wouldn't
have thought of doing that change.

Well, if someone does something in a wrong way, that need not mean the
thing he was trying to do was wrong.
Somehow, I knew you would point at this ...

May I say I'm not convinced?

At least _that_ wasn't me. :-)
