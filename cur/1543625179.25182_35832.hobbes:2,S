Did you actually read it? I did and I agree with him. Depending on your 
market niche, being a commercial company releasing free software can be 
complete business suicide, killing the single, most important revenue 
stream for the company.
Linux is growing and as such is being more and more commercialised and with 
this we will see more and more commercial, non-free, non-GPL software. I 
don't see what the fuss is all about. I am into Linux because it is a good 
OS and I would like to contribute to improving it and not just because it 
is free software. Free software is only good in particular market niches or 
when one does it as a hobby in unsuitable market niches. Everyone has to 
eat and many people have a family to support. You can't do that unless you 
earn money and far too few people manage to get paid for working on free 
software exactly because it is not profitable (again depending on market 
niche)...
Just my 2p.
Best regards,
Anton
ps. No I am not trying to start a flame war but I felt the post was too 
harsch to be left without reply.
