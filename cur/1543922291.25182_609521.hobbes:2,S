As it doesn't actually output anything but extends
a buffer pointer in a struct, perhaps it's better to
rename sb_printf to sb_sprintf.
I believe the common use will be GFP_ATOMIC.
Perhaps a default wrapper define and a renamed function?
void sb_sprintf_gfp(struct stringbuf *sb, gfp_t gfp, const char *fmt, ...)
#define sb_sprintf(sb, fmt, arg...) \
	sb_sprintf_gfp(sb, GFP_ATOMIC, fmt, ##arg)
