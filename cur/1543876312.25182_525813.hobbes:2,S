That seems to have helped.  If I watch
/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM?/temperature, it seems stable even under
load.   I didn't try watching the thermal_zones when these options were
enabled, but I presume the temperature was not controlled for it to hit
128 degC.
What's going on here?  Does reading an i2c sensor from the kernel
prevent something else from doing it?
