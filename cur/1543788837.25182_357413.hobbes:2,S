I can confirm this on NFSv3 UDP export from patched 2.6.11.11 server
(dual opteron 64-bit kernel) to two different SMP (32-bit x86) clients
with 2.6.12.4 and 2.6.11.11 kernels.
There are definitely timing issues - in order to reproduce the problem I
had to use "touch . ; echo 2 > r" and "touch r; cat r" on the clients -
I couldn't type the commands quickly enough one-by-one.
But right now I have:
[phoenix:joe] $ cat r
2
[raven:joe] $ cat r
1
Beautiful :)
