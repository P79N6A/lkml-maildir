Hi all,
After latest ACPI merge /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC has gone fishing :
[~]> ls -al /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Şub 12 20:44 ADP1
[~]> ls -al /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ADP1
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 Şub 12 20:44 state
This at least breaks HAL which thinks AC is always plugged in, is this change 
intentional?
Regards,
