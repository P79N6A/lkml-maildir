TERM=linux attribute escape codes did not change for a decade (or so).
Making greping and coloring in userspace by means of klibc (+ GNU sed)
and initramfs will solve this easily, provided there's useful
kernel->console[userspace] interface. Ugly hacks, like those patches,
aren't for my view of an useful feature.

If you are not going to see OOPes of new kernels running old distros, ask
any perl hacker (as they lovely mentioned in lkml) to hack for you
something like:
sed -u -e '
/^<1/s_^_'$COLOR1'_
/^<2/s_^_'$COLOR2'_
/^<3/s_^_'$COLOR3'_
/^<4/s_^_'$COLOR4'_
/^<5/s_^_'$COLOR5'_
/^<6/s_^_'$COLOR6'_
/^<7/s_^_'$COLOR7'_
' < /proc/kmsg >/dev/tty
place whole that perl shit on initrams of your kernel, run it in
background as early as possible with switched off default console output
(i.e. quiet boot).
OVER.
For really good output it would be better to have escape code to
serialize printing, thus no coloring brain damage will appear in
concurrent writes on the tty (multiple areas, cursor movements). And this
is only start of what can be done here.
