All these discussions about moving stuff to /usr are forgetting one
fundamental point in the FHS - /usr is NOT guaranteed to be mounted
at boot.  In fact, /usr may very well be shared between machines.
Therefore, if you have the following situation:
	/    = /dev/hda1
	/usr = /dev/sda1
or even:
	/    = /dev/hda1
	/usr = /dev/md0
and you have your scsi driver (or raid subsystem) as a module, you need
/usr/modules to mount /usr, but you don't have /usr mounted because you
don't have the module... catch 22.
/ should contain everything you need to get the system up and running.
Not /usr.  Therefore, modules must not be placed under /usr.
