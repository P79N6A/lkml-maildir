Yes, I am talking about text framebuffer console acceleration and 
mode sets. Graphics mode consoles can benefit tremendously from 
hardware accelerated blitting (for scrolling) and hardware 
accelerated text rendering for drawing the fonts.

A call to vm86 simply goes into the kernel, and the code is then run 
at ring 3 in a vm86 task (ie: the code runs natively as real mode 
code, and is not emulated). The only complication is some I/O port 
writes cannot be unvirtualised, so we have to virtualise them in user 
land to go to the hardware directly. That code could also be done 
inside the kernel if there was a performance overhead for this, but 
our testing indicated this was not necessary (once I worked the bugs 
out of LRMI for Josh so that it actually worked properly, quite a 
while ago now ;-).

I am not thinking of this for X11 support; native XFree86 drivers 
should be used for that running in user land. I am thinking of 
framebuffer console support that can utilise XFree86 4.0 loadable 
modules to implement the mode set and blitting functions. Why re-
write code when it could be re-used (even at the binary level!).

I totally agree.

No, I was thinking of utilising XFree86 4.0 loadable chipset driver 
modules to implement the daemon.

Nope. VBE/AF is dead.

Don't pay VESA a cent for the specs. I invented VBE/AF (both version 
1.0 which is a standard, and 2.0 which never passed), wrote the 
specifications, sample code and initial implementations. As much as 
we tried and tried, they would never release the VBE/AF 
specifications freely so that people could actually *use* it, but 
instead tried charging ridiculous fees for it. Hence VESA essentially 
destroyed VBE/AF, as they only sold less than 10 copies over a period 
of two years!
Then they canned the VESA Software Standards Committee due to lack of 
interest. No wonder no-one was interested when no-one was using the 
damn specs!

Forget the VBE 3.0 PMI interface functions, at least for now. 
Unfortunately a number of well known graphics cards (NVIDIA boards 
from Diamond) shipped with a broken VBE 3.0 PMI interface. NVIDIA 
fixed their implementation ages ago, but Diamond refused to update 
their BIOS code and ship the fix, so using VBE 3.0 on any Diamond 
boards will likely result in a hard crash.
Also the VBE 3.0 PMI interface is an optional part of the spec 
(something I fought hard to get changed, but the vendors wanted it 
optional), and hence most VBE 3.0 BIOS'es I have seen do not 
implement this interface at all.

I can't comment on this definitively, but off the top of my head I 
can't think of anything that would need real mode BIOS access except 
the graphics card support.

Right. So we could boot up in text mode and then change to a graphics 
mode console when the daemon loads (kinda like the SVGA text mode 
facilities are used to change resolutions etc after the system has 
booted).

I will email you copies of the code that you can use, under the GPL 
license. Feel free to cut and paste what stuff you need, but make 
sure you retain my copyright in your code somewhere.
You should be able to use the DDC BIOS functions easily enough from 
user land to read the EDID from the monitor. Red Hat already does 
this (initially using code I sent them, which they re-wrote somewhat) 
in their latest 6.1 install program to determine the best refresh 
rate to use.
