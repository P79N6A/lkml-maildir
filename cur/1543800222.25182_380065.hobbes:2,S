Dear Alessandro,
Thanks for the reply.
What does that the make CC=<path_to_your_gcc_3.3> do? 
Will it set my gcc default build configuration to gcc 3.3?
I mean the general procedure is make bzImage; make modules....
How do I do these:
Will I have to do it like:
	make bzImage cc=<gcc path>
Best Regards,
Mukund Jampala
