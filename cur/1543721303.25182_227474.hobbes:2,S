Linus isn't the person to send this to :)

You know you still can't rely on the events happening in "numerical"
order, even with this patch, right?
That's what tools like udev is for, that way you can always name your
/dev/ttyUSB* devices properly.
Anyway, I don't have a problem with this patch, other than it doesn't
apply to the current USB tree, as there has been a lot of work in the
hub driver recently.  Care to make it up again against the latest -mm
release, as that has the USB development tree included in it.
thanks,
