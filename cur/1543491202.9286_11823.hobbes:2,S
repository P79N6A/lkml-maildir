   Just guessing, but it is generally bad idea to hit X with kill
   -9. When you shutdown and X are running, that _might_ happen. I do
   not know consequences - trashed display is the obvious one.
This is wrong too.  shutdown sends a SIGTERM or some other "light"
signal, which X receives and then shuts down cleanly.
Anyone who says that shutting down your machine from within' X can be
expected to crash your machine, and that this is OK, is smoking crack.
That's %100 a bug in my book.
