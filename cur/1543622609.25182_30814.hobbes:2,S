Well, my intention was not to push this patch into high-res-timers.
Rather, once this patch may have made it into the kernel, the
high-res-timers patch should back out the simple 64 bit jiffies stuff,
i.e. init_jiffieswrap_timer(), check_jiffieswrap() and get_jiffies64(),
and do all this in its own way, just provide a new get_jiffies64() 
function that does the (read high, low, high; compare) stuff.
If you see problems with the get_jiffies64() interface, or prefer another 
name, please say so.
Since you did not raise any hard objections, I count this as an "you moron 
put some extra work on me, but I can stand it, so it's OK with me" ;-)
Thanks,
Tim
