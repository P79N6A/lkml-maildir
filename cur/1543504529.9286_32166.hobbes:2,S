Hello,
Just a plea for help & submissions :)
I am working on list of Linux/i386 system calls.
Main idea is to make something like TechHelp.
I think that this document can be quite useful.
If someone is interested and wants to help, please do it.
Any syscall related submissions are welcome!
Thanks.
Current version is available from 
http://lightning.voshod.com/asm/syscall.html
ps: I am not on the list, please reply to me directly.
Regards,
Konstantin.
