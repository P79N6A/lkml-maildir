Thanks for the tip. I found that patch and applied the parts for the drivers 
I use. This cured the oops and also allowed "hot unplugging" to finally work 
under 2.6 for CF cards! Is there a timeline for when this goes into mainline 
and/or -mm?
I can still get an oops from the vfs layer if I try to access a card just 
after I remove it suggesting there are some timeout issues somewhere but 
this is a *massive* improvement on where things were before! I'm really 
pleased to see this :)
Thanks,
Richard
