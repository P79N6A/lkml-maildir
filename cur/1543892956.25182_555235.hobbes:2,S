i'm pleased to announce release -v16 of the CFS scheduler patchset.
The rolled-up CFS patch against v2.6.22-rc4, v2.6.22-rc4-mm2, v2.6.21.4 
or v2.6.20.13 can be downloaded from the usual place:
     
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/
-v16 includes smaller fixes. Continued work on precise /proc CPU 
accounting of both SCHED_OTHER and RT tasks by Dmitry Adamushko and 
Balbir Singh. Reniced tasks should now disturb nice-0 tasks even less. 
Also, i have changed SCHED_BATCH back to its current mainline meaning 
and have added a SCHED_IDLEPRIO instead (first introduced by Con Kolivas 
in staircase/RSDL/SD).
Changes since -v15:
 - more /proc CPU stats accounting improvements (Dmitry Adamushko, 
   Balbir Singh)
 - fix SCHED_BATCH (reported by Con Kolivas)
 - update_load_fair() - use 64-bit arithmetics (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - fix RT->NORMAL accounting issue raised by Srivatsa Vaddagiri: have 
   correct exec_start stamping. (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - check for negative deltas in task_sched_runtime() (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - check for large forward-jumping sched_clock()
 - cleanup: remove task_struct :: last_ran (Dmitry Adamushko)
 - /proc/sched_debug printk fixes (Andrew Morton)
 - add SCHED_IDLEPRIO
 - consolidate the granularity settings and make them scale together
 - improve /proc/sched_debug output
 - remove the yield workarounds - the default seems to be working now.
 - introduce lower and upper limits for the granularity tunables. 
   Setting them to zero accidentally broke nice levels.
 - various small fixes/cleanups
As usual, any sort of feedback, bugreport, fix and suggestion is more 
than welcome!
	Ingo
