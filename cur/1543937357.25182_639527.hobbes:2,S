I saw it just once, yesterday:

[root@doppio ~]#
on a lenovo T60W, core2duo machine (2GHz), when using it to stress test
another machine, I was using netperf TCP_STREAM ranging from 1 to 8
streams + a ping -f using various packet sizes.
I'll update this machine today to 2.6.24-rc8-git + net-2.6 and try again
to reproduce.
I also applied David's patch while trying some RT experiments on
another, 8 way machine used as a server, but on this machine I didn't
experience the Tx Unit Hang message with or without the patch.
