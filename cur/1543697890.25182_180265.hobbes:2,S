To be fair, sys_copy is never intended to replace cp or try to be
very smart. I don't think it is semantically supposed to do much more
than replace a read, write loop (of course, the syscall also has an
offset and count).
sparse copying would be implementation dependant. If cp wanted to do
something special it would not use one big copy call. I think unlink
/ overwrite is irrelevant if its semantically a read write loop.
