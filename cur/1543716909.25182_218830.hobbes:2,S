Hm.  In 2.6 we use an NTP adjusted wall time and a wall_to_monotonic offset.  I 
don't really see the advantage here.  Does this change buy us something?
For what its worth, I introduced the wall_to_monotonic offset just because it 
was easier to do (and understand, I think) in the current kernel.

Right, and it needs to be recast to use secs and nanosecs...  But you forget the 
accounting code which needs the periodic interrupt to charge time to whom ever.

Yes, and there is also a problem getting a stable, reliable, and correct 
calibration of TSC to PIT even with a constant TSC rate.  In the HRT patch I 
finally resorted to correcting the TSC last read value on a regular basis.  With 
out this it drifts (or maybe, more correctly, the calibration was wrong) enough 
to mess up the high res timers.
I suspect that while we use two different timers (PIT & TSC or PIT & pm-timer or 
...) that don't use the same source clock we will continue to have such 
problems.  Other archs have a much easier time of it.
