yeah. The micro-timings of latency tracing can be misleading. Function 
calls are very fast on most CPUs (even on a 600MHz one), but with the 
latency tracer generating one trace entry per function call, there's 
considerable added overhead.
we could in theory calibrate the tracing overhead and subtract it from 
cycle readings [i've done this in a previous mcount() based tracer 
implementation, years ago], but that would make the latency trace 
timestamps less useful as a global time reference.
