Subject: 2.6.9-rc1: scrolling with tdfxfb 5 times slower

The recent changes in frame buffer code seems to affect performance of 
scrolling on my system:
Voodoo Banshee (tdfxfb)
CONFIG:
#
# Graphics support
#
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_3DFX=y
# CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL is not set
#
# Console display driver support
#
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_MDA_CONSOLE is not set
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_FONTS is not set
CONFIG_FONT_8x8=y
CONFIG_FONT_8x16=y
Tests with "linux/MAINTAINERS" (time cat MAINTAINERS)
2.6.8.1
	real    0m2.625s
	user    0m0.000s
	sys     0m2.621s
2.6.9-rc1
	real    0m13.528s
	user    0m0.000s
	sys     0m13.553s
Also many -mm kernels are affected... this is obvious because these patches 
come from Andrew's tree ;-)
Any ideas?
