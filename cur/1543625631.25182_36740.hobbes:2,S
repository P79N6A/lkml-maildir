Just a tiny nit to pick...

This function can be called by non-Intel hardware. No other vendor has
a family 15 CPU, but it's one less surprise if ever someone does make
one.
Also, take a look at bluesmoke.c in 2.5.7-dj1, it's quite a bit
different from mainline (in particular the timer foo), and also
incorporates some of the bits from your patch already.
Other than that, looks fine to me.
