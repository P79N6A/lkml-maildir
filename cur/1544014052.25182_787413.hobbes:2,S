One of the pratical issues I have with this is when to read which files.
What we could do is something like:
- during *config scan all "wildcard enabled" directories
  and read the Kconfig info from the relevant .C files.
- record which .C files which included Kconfig and do
  an automatic "scan + oldconfig" when one of these files
  changes
When we add new Kconfig info to a file we would have
to manually do the *config to trigger a scan for the .C files
In the .C file we should restrict us to the first 100 lines or so
to have the Kconfig info to speedd up the 'parse' for this info.
Something like this:
/* Kconfig
config FOO
	tristate "A self contained driver"
	depends on USB
	source mydriver-debug.c if DEBUG
	modulename foobar
	help
	  This is a driver for ...
*/
The source file where this info is contained is implicit a source
of this module.
And if we can convince the firmware guys then the firmware info could
be included in the same section.
