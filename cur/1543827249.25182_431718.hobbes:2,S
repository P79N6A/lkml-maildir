Also, the places where ieee1394_file_to_instance() is used appear not to 
be fast paths. (It's the struct file_operations.open() hook of two 
protocol drivers.) I.e. there is no harm in replacing it by whatever 
more expensive lookup method.
Dv1394 calls ieee1394_file_to_instance() from within spin_lock_irqsave() 
/unlock_irqrestore(), but it can easily moved out of it if need be.
