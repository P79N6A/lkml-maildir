For the same reason you might need fsync() or fdatasync().  To force
changes to be written now, without having to munmap() the area, so that
you have a gurantee that current data is on disk and will not be lost.

Without syncing, Linux writes whenever it thinks it's appropriate, e.g.
when pages have to be freed (I think also when the bdflush writes back
data, i.e. every 30 seconds by default).
