Not sure if it is possible to create a large filesystem in memory... a
ramdisk... of size 64 mb... or 128 mb... i'm not sure why creating a
ramdisk of this size wouldn't be possible to achieve... i'd like to use
this large ramdisk after linux on disk has been booted..
From the info i've read... it seems like the size limit of a ramdisk can
only be 4 mb..
Pat.
