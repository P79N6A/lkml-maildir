Hello,
  Just thought I would report the errors I am currently seeing.
An interupt inside of an interrupt with the aic7xxx driver.
  card 39160/160m scsi
Raid tools fail to compile. Appears intel assembly not alpha.
modutils:depmod fail to run. reaches limits on number of symbols.
Kernel <make boot> build fails to build a small executable in
arch/alpha/kernel
Breaks alsa-drivers. (standard at in effect for noat)
The recursive interrupts is the real problem....
