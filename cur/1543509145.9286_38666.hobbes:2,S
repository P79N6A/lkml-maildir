	But that brings up a larger question of why there are spin
   locks at all?  If a CPU can't be doing one thing because a
   particular resource is unavailable being used by another CPU, why
   isn't it then sent off to do something else?
Please read "Unix Systems for Modern Architectures" by Curt Schimmel
for a good primer on spinlocks and why they are used in an OS.
