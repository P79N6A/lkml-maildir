hi
is there an howto document witch describe how i could
port an linux 2.0 fddi-pci device driver to 2.2??
i am at the point where the driver module compiles and loads 
fine (i think).
but if i do ifconfig fddi0 x.x.x.x ... the box locks hard!
(sending icmp echo requests to the ethernet interface 
triggers no response)
yours, oliver teuber
