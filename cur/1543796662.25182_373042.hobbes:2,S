But this code should be part of the stack, as nearly every driver needs
it. Management handling should be really managed by the kernel. The same
applies to driver<->userspace communication - there is no need to bother
every driver with it. And so on.
The hard part is that every driver will need a slightly different amount
of this support depending on the amount of features that are provided by
firmware.

I understand.

No. I just think we (everybody) should concentrate at one particular
stack, finish it and merge it. And I'm convinced Jouni's stack is
currently the best solution available - far far from perfect, with many
issues, but still the best - and it will finally save as much time.
