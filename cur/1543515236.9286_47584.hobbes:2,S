the function below assumes that module_list always points to the module 
with the highest virtual address in module_info->addr. Now that I think 
of it, it is not a fair assumption (though true if you never unload any 
modules), so get_kcore_size should really walk through the list and pick
up the highest address.
I will adjust it, test it and send the patch later.

Tigran.
