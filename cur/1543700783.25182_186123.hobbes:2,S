Even if you can't find a way to do this, you can cheat: use an
iptables DNAT rule to translate connections to the desired port into
connections to a non-privileged port upon which your daemon is
actually listening. Something like:
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 1.2.3.4:8080
