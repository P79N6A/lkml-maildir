Subject: [2.3.9] Cool, but socket.o left out...

	Hi I compiled and ran 2.3.9 with no problems and no changes except
for the following:
  * PPP modules won't load due to many many undefined symbols.  But 
it compiles fine.  Presumably this will start to work after
the main IP code stabilizes, and the kernel Gods deem 2.3 fit for testing
by mortals without ethernet access?
  * FAT is out of date... doesn't compile.
  * socket.o was not linked in?  I used a patch which exported the symbol
csum_partial_copy_nocheck from netsyms.c, which is included in socket.o.
I just added socket.o to network.a and then the linker stopped complaining
about the symbol being undefined.  However, linking in socket.o just to
define one symbol seems wrong...
