arch/i386/vmlinux.lds is generated from arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S, using
$(CPP).  It looks like your version of cpp is doing something very
strange to the text, it has split '.stab 0 : { *(.stab) }' over two
lines.  I do not see this with egcs 2.91.66, what does gcc -v report?
Try removing arch/i386/vmlinux.lds and running make bzImage again, that
will create a fresh copy of vmlinux.lds.
