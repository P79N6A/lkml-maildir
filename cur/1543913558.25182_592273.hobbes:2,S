i doubt its bad harddrive / powersupply (just replaced it) , i think this
new driver has some bugs that need to be fixed, if i use the old ide
pdc202xx_old the drive works fine maybe the new driver is detecting res
51/84:00:3f:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/e0 as ata bus error when it might be
seagates way of saying OK or success (im not sure), anyways for the time
being im running the old ide drivers on the promise ide card untill the new
drivers get some more bugs fixed, im using the new nforce2 ata drivers
flawlessly for the system drives, the pdc card is just for backups..
maybe when the next kernel comes out ill try the new pata_pdc202xx_old
drivers again.
