Actually knfsd does call mount when it crosses a mount point on the nfs
server it generates an equivalent mount point in linux.  At least I think
that is the what it is doing.  It is very similar to our mount propagation
path.
However as a special case I don't think the permission checking is likely
to bite us there.  It is worth double checking once we have the other details
ironed out.
