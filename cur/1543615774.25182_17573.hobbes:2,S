Yep true, 20% of CPUs are dumb but this 20% of CPUs run 95% of the Linux world.

Alan, near to my box i've a dual cpu appliance that is running an mta that
uses pthread and that is routing ( under test ) about 600000 messages / hour
Its rq load is about 9-10 and the cs is about 8000-9000.
You know what is the scheduler weight, barely 8-10% with the the 2.4.17
scheduler. It drops to nothing using BMQS w/out any O(1) mirage.
