Ok, go ahead and call my mama - tell her i used a bad word on a mailing
list.
Folks, this is a actually a republic model: in other words its a
democracy upto a certain level then there maybe a veto. 
You have been provided a facility to go and do what funky thing that
pleases you. Use ARPTABLEs; if you dont like it maintain your own
patches - you have that freedom; dont enforce your freedom on someone
actually doing the maintanace work - they have more important things to
worry about.
You can quote all the RFCs you want - it wont change anything soon. I
got tired of following same cyclic arguements. What Linux is doing is
conformant. What other people following CISCO are doing is also
conformant. RFCs are written in an ambigous language called english.
People actually (lately anyways) sneak in ambiguity to make their
implementation look correct. So please stop quoting stoopid RFCs. 
cheers,
jamal
