Yeah, it was a stupid hacky thing to avoid the "list_empty()", but doing 
it explicitly is fine (we don't hold the lock, so the list isn't 
necessarily stable, but doing "list_empty()" is fine because we don't ever 
dereference the pointers, we just compare the pointers themselves).
I shouldn't have done that hacky thing, it wasn't worth it.
