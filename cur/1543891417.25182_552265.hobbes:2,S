Yes. Sometimes it's just more natural to have
	ptr = kmalloc(size);
	.. use it ..
	free(ptr);
and if a *degenerate* case of size=0 happens, who cares? It should just 
work, as long as we (obviously) don't actually try to access the pointer.
So I don't much like the WARN_ON(size == 0). I think it potentially just 
causes people to write around it, and quite possibly causes the callers to 
write code that is not at all more readable or maintainable!
That's why I'd much rather return BADPTR instead: we'll get an oops for 
buggy code, but we don't penalize the "natural" and good code! So once you 
return BADPTR, there really isn't any good reason for the WARN_ON.
