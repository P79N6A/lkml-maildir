MPEG is a great example where this is not at all necessary.  The MPEG
player should buffer up enough frames that it can react to changes in
the computing environment around it (change playback quality,
whatever...)  The buffer acts, in many ways, like a time machine: it
makes it possible to notice a drop in performance before it needs to
drop frames as a result.
