This should already be fixed, in some fashion, in -mm:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.19-rc5/2.6.19-rc5-mm2/broken-out/handle-ext3-directory-corruption-better.patch
I have been looking at doing a check only when the block is first read,
but other things have come up & taken some time, and that is a bit on
the back burner now...
