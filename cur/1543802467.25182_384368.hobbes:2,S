"Becasue you might" is a bad argument. Either you do or you don't. My  
guess is that you don't
becase the amount of data to be handled is absymally small. (Come one  
48kBaud is not much...)
And BTW. good luck trying to convince  the /dev/random gang that it  
isn't good for performance
what they are doing on the IRQ path...
