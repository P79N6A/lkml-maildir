I think you've convinced me that vmalloc is not a good choice when a
driver needs a large buffer (many megabytes) for DMA.
In this case, we need a large ring buffer for reception of isochronous
packets from a firewire device.  If I understand you correctly, you are
suggesting that this buffer be obtained as followed:
1. Application performs malloc() in user-space and mmap()s it.
2. Driver uses vmalloc_to_page() on every page of the malloc'ed memory
and constructs a scatter-gather list.
3. Map the sg list with pci_map_sg().
4. Commence DMA.
Is that correct?  In particular, does it do the right thing in terms of
pinning the memory and dealing with high memory?
I notice that the block I/O API has some convenience functions for this,
but this is not a block device.  Are there some other convenience
functions that can be used?
Forgive me if these are obvious questions -- I'm not the developer of
video1394, but I'd still like get it right for the new firewire stack
that's being developed.
Thanks,
David
