First, you're dereferencing an ioremapped pointer directly instead of
using readb() et al.  This is a portability no-no but happens to work
on x86.
Second, only images of code type 0 (Intel x86, PC-AT compatible) are
specified to have length as the third byte.  OpenFirmware, PA-RISC and
EFI may or may not have size as the third byte.  It's also possible
that there are multiple images in the ROM.  So what you have to do to
be correct is something like ...
	int last_image;
	char *image = rom;
	do {
		char *pds;
		if (readb(image) != 0x55)
			break;
		if (readb(image + 1) != 0xAA)
			break;
		pds = image + readw(image + 16);
		if (readb(pds) != 'P')
			break;
		if (readb(pds + 1) != 'C')
			break;
		if (readb(pds + 2) != 'I')
			break;
		if (readb(pds + 3) != 'R')
			break;
		last_image = readb(pds + 21) & 0x80;
		image += readw(pds + 16) * 512;
	} while (!last_image);
But I'm not sure it's worth it.  I'm inclined to just map the whole thing.
