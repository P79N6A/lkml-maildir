Hi,
I have been working on various serial drivers and I notice that physical
driver close routine is called in all cases even if the physical driver
open routine fails.  That suggests to me that a lot of the MOD_DEC/INC_COUNT
logic in serial.c and other physical serial drivers is incorrect.  As
serial.c seems usually to be compiled into the kernel the issue
is not so important, but a lot of the other logic associated with
open counts also seems incorrect.  Is this observation correct?
