You don't mention the storage used, which is quite relevant.
If you have the time, please rerun with 2.6.17-rc6-gitX latest. Although
I'm not sure why you think CSCAN is a good scheduling algorithm, in
general it may be fine but there are trivial non-root 'dos' attacks. Any
of the non-noop Linux io schedulers is a better choice imo.
