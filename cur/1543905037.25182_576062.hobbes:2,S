Up till now i haven't read the interview with Linus.

It is interesting, he mentiones a lesson to learn from Microsoft:
"'Well, historically, the most important lesson from Microsoft - and one they 
themselves seem to have forgotten - is simply 'Give your customers what they 
want'."
But as i see all the discussion here that's what's _not_ being honored. People 
request swap prefetch, it wouldn't be hard to give it to them but they 
probably won't get it (or it takes a 5 days, 200+ messages discussion(in the 
ck list alone were already 190 messages posted about this)).
Give the people plugshed so everyone can happily be using SD instead of CFS -  
no way!
There sure are more examples to be given.
Dirk.
