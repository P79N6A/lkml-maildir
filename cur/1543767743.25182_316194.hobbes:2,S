 oh.
 ah.
 wait - this might be the bit i don't get 
 when you say poll again, do you mean poll again inside the ISR?
 so:
 * we do the read (which creates the interrupt to the PIC) and
   then sit there polling the level-driven interrupt status
   register
 * the PIC, having no more bytes to write, clears the ARM
   level-driven interrupt.
 * the ARM detects the change of the level-driven interrupt
   status register
 * the ARM pauses for, oh, i dunno... mmm... 6mhz equals 166ns
   so we call udelay(10) or something ridiculously long...
 * the ARM then checks the level-driven interrupt status register
   AGAIN, and if it's clear, goes "oh, we ain't gonna get no
   more data".
 something like that? [am trying it now, anyway - on the basis that it
 can't hurt :)]
 i'm not being deliberately thick - honest - i've just never had to
 do this sort of thing before.
 btw alan where would you recommend i read up on this type of thing?
 [_please_ don't say "on the inside of my skull" i'll be tempted to
 go get a saw and a spoon i've _so_ got to get this to work...]

 tried that last month [i'm not sending to lkml about this as a first
 resort - honest!]
 the baud rate from the GPS is 4800 baud, so that's 600 chars/sec.
 the jiffies timer on the ARM is ... er... 250? per second?
 so ... hey, yeh, that would explain why i saw about 1
 character in 3 :)

 ahhh :)
 glad i checked then, 'cos up until 30 seconds ago i was gonna
 drive to aber.
 *wonders why the hell i've been let loose on this project...*
