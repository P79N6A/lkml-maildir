People that experience problems that I have a fix for in the repo,
usually get pointed to that repo for testing.
In this case I did the fix after -rc2, wasn't comfortable enough to send
it for -rc3 and I think I may wait for 2.6.6-rc1 since there's a harder
to reproduce bug now that I have to fix (I haven't seen it, but a few
people that tested our repo have reported it).
