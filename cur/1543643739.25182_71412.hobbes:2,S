shmem uses GFP_USER for its index pages to GFP_HIGHUSER data pages.
Not to say there aren't other problems in the mix too, but Bill's
main problem here will be one you discovered a while ago, Andrew.
We fixed it then, but in my loopable tmpfs version, and I've been
slow to extract the fixes and push them to mainline (or now -mm),
since there's not much else that suffers than dbench.
The problem is that dbench likes to do large random(?) seeks and
then writes at resulting offset; and although shmem-tmpfs imposes
a cap (default: half of memory) on the data pages, it imposes no
cap on its index pages.  So it foolishly ends up filling normal
zone with empty index blocks for zero-length files, the index
page allocation being done _before_ the data cap check.
I'll rebase the relevant fixes against 2.5.35-mm1 later today,
do a little testing and post the patch.
What I never did was try GFP_HIGHUSER and kmap on the index pages:
I think I decided back then that it wasn't likely to be needed
(sparsely filled file indexes are a rarer case than sparsely filled
pagetables, once the stupidity is fixed; and small files don't use
index pages at all).  But Bill's testing may well prove me wrong.
