a) we must allow concurrent write operations for pipes (O_NONBLOCK).
b) are you sure that these statements are true for a large database?
I think the right aproach would be new functions [public, because needed
by nfsd and arch/*/kernel/sys*.c]
	int inode_lock_write(inode, filp, offset, len);
	...
	int inode_lock_rename(inode_source,inode_dest);
	...
and flags so that the f_ops implementation can choose the amount of
synchronization it needs.
Or you could add new function pointers to f_ops/i_ops for
synchronization.
