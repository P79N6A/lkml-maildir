I'll give that a try tomorrow.  I'll let this thing (sans PREEMPT and REGPARM) cook
on Andy's script overnight.  The kernel is up to date through Changeset 1.1724.
The original problem happened only about 20% of the time during bk pulls.
Prior to 4/15/04 (or perhaps a day or two before at most), it never happened.
The 'it' being the 'Assertion `s && s->tree' failed' during a bk pull.
