Subject: [PATCH 0/5] UML - Five for 2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This batch should go into the 2.6.25 merge window.
There are a couple of patches which had been sitting in -mm waiting
for this merge window, but got lost somehow:
	runtime host vmsplit detection - Miklos spotted a bug, since
fixed, with a 32-bit UML on a 64-bit host
	style fixes in arch/um/os-Linux - there's a false-positive
checkpatch complaint with this one
The rest are bug fixes.
