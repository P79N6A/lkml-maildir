It was actually a network configuration problem - I got a wrong IP via
DHCP and changed it to the right one manually. So network was
configured, portmap+amd started, IP address changed from under amd and
then amd hung. Fixing the network configuration made the hang go away so
I will probably not dig into the reasons why amd hangs indefinitely when
the IP chnages.
The kernel is certainly not at fault, it was my bad.
