And that is the final answer for $14,000.  Looks like I got Yet Another 
Large Paperweight(tm) to deal with.  Yup, this thing is broken.  I tried
it on my dad's machine today, and Windows chucked the thing out as invalid
format right away.  Oh well, maybe I should enroll in an electronics class
and fix it myself.
