Here's an idea that has been mulling under my mullet for 
the last few weeks:
the nbd can be used for a swap device, but since swap has no reason
to inform the drive about what parts of it are free, it is not possible
to have a central nbd server overcommit for multiple client swapping
nodes.
Therefore I wonder how tricky it would be to create a swap interface
that is ignorant of disk geometries.   the swap interface language
would accept requests for space, with unique handles, and would
return the swapped-out data on representation of the handle.  Like
a virtual memory hat check.
