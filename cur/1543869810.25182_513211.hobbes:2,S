I'm doing nothing special. And I'm less sure now about the trigger. I
built a Fedora 7 test 2 install tree with the patch reverted, and
managed to boot and install.... but now when I boot the _same_ machine
with the same CD, it fails. 
Now I'm starting to wonder if it's something the firmware sets up to DMA
to a certain region of memory, which makes it non-deterministic. And the
other things we're blaming are only making a difference because they
change the layout of what we have in memory.
