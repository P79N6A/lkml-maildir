The code to deal with the 2 latches per APIC level is already
problematic in other ways. I'm not sure how much we can be allowed to
mix the issues. But I wouldn't mind at least hearing about alternative
methods of dealing with that that interact better with the rest of the
APIC mechanics. My interest in particular is vector exhaustion, but as
you point out rearrangements of that can also serve to make the TPR
more meaningful than it is now, and perhaps reduce mutual interference
between devices generating many interrupts and those generating few.
