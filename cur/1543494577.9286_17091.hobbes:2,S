I must confess I've been a bit devious and posted a deliberately
flammatory message, and I'm pleased with the debate that occurred. Thanks
everyone for the information (nice flames in my mailbox, btw, so that's
good) =8-). 
Upon my experience with past flamage for other stuff, the flames were
noticeably weaker and had a much higher signal to noise factor. Keep it up
guys, I think the slashdotters have moved on. =) And yes, no mailbombs. 
Cheers, 
Alex
