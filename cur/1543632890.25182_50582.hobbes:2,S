Well it's a convenience thing.  Not really worth a lot of code.
I expect most of the proposed functionality could be provided
from userspace anyway via the disk IO number in /proc/stat:
	old_counts=get_counters()
	while 1 {
		sleep 5
		if (old_counts != get_counters()) {
			sync
			sleep 10
			old_counts = get_counters()
		}
	}
This doesn't have the "if we flushed for any reason, reset the
timer" optimisation.  But it will work in 2.4.
So I think I'll just settle for making the ext3 journal timer
expiries tunable.
