The current status on the board I'm using
-	The BIOS appears to misconfigure the PCI setup badly, so badly I've
	been sticking in PCI quirk fixups to make some drivers work
-	MP 1.4 locks solid MP 1.1 is ok - that may be a Linux bug. I have a
	patch to test there
-	The onboard USB was removed and swapped for a plug in card wasting
	a slot (but you do get USB2 now). The manual wasn't updated
-	The disk led appears to be marked wrongly. If you wire it the 
	board won't POST
-	If you put a 33Mhz card in the 64bit slots the board won't POST
	unless you configure the board the way the manual suggests you don't
-	Expect to want > 400W PSU if you have lots of disks. I ended up 
	using a 550W PSU
-	Use a _BIG_ case. With anything but a large tower and actual
	case fans you are not going to get enough ventilation or cable
	room
Having said all that - when you figure through the mess that ASUS calls
QA and documentation (and they should be firing people for shipping it in
its current state quite frankly) it goes like a bat out of hell. With dual
Athlon 1800MP+ processors and hardware raid for the filestore and swap its
building the entirity of XFree86 in 30 minutes wall time (5 of which are
doing non parallelisable work and 5 or so of which are spent in I/O wait)
Nice hardware, lousy docs, dreadful BIOS.
