It's not a realistic requirement for me to solve your customer problems. 
:) I've been involved in this argument before, and the arguments have been 
the same, pretty much along party lines of IBM vs. Everyone else. I'm not 
here to point fingers, but you must heed the fact that we've been here 
before.

Well, along with more memory and more devices, I would expect your 
customers to also be paying for the fastest processors. :)

Uh, let's recap: 
" This ended up increasing the size of kobject from 52 bytes to 108 bytes
but saving one dentry and inode per kobject. " 
Under one usage model, you've saved memory, however under the case where 
kobjects are used and not represnted in sysfs, you've more than doubled 
the overhead, and you've increased the total overhead in the worst case - 
when all dentries are looked up and pinned.

I understand what you're trying to do, and I say it's the wrong approach. 
You're overloading kobjects in a manner unintended, and in a way that is 
not welcome. I do not have an alternative solution, but my last email gave 
some hints of where to look. Don't get bitter because I disagree.

That's what I told you, only reversed - try again. The patch posted in 
unacceptable, though I'm willing to look at alternatives. I don't have or 
see a problem with the current situation, so your arguments are going to 
have to be a bit stronger. 
Thanks,
