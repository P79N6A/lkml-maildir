It makes the queueing simpler (you could potentially leave the _last_
request on the queue, but it's probably not worth the hassle).
They should not call elv_next_request() only to bail if
num_req_outstanding is too big, since it has side effects (moving
request from io scheduler core to dispatch, which makes it ineligible
for merging, sorting, etc).
	do {
		if (too_many_queued)
			break;
		rq = elv_next_request(q);
		if (!rq)
			break;
		...
	}

Yep
