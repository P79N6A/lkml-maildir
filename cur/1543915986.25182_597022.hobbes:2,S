I don't think we have been "banging heads" with you (unless that is your 
feeling?) - how about "working together, but diverting to satisfy different 
needs" :)
I think that we have had more issues in the uClinux-dist (userspace and build 
environment), but for kernel code, we have moved from some non-standard 
(stupid) things we were doing early on to what we have today - which is as 
common/standard with other archs as we can be.
Although this is slightly off topic - on the uClinux distribution side - most 
of our changes are based on requirements/desires from being able to support 
fdpic elf and flat formats, and to attempt to make things easier for end 
users/us to use/maintain. Where we do make changes - we always send the patch 
upstream and have the conversation with you (not everyone else does this), 
and some/most times rework things so they are more acceptable to you. We 
don't always come to an agreement - but we always have the discussion, and 
are willing to move if we can make things better that still meets both our 
needs/desires.

That is what we thought.

As always - we are more than happy to explore/review alternative patches if 
people want to write/sumbit them.
