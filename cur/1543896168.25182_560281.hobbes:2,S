Whether the sources you download from Tivo compile says very little.
It certainly does not mean I am wrong.  I could give you binary for
version A and sources for version B -- and the sources would compile.
The kernel you build from the source code that Tivo distributes must
be accepted by Tivo's hardware without making other modifications (to
Tivo's hardware or bootloader).  If that is possible, I will retract
what I said.  If it is not possible, they are omitting part of the
program's source code:
    A "computer program" is a set of statements or instructions to be
    used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about
    a certain result.
