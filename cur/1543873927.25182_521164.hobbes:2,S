Hi Sam,
maybe my prev letter was lost, so let me repeat - I think your patch
is pretty good to be merged into kernel. Did you send any patch to
Andrew? Btw I think we may leave "Load Alternate..." and "Save
Alternate..." as is - the user always may know what the config he is
using on the main dialog title :)
