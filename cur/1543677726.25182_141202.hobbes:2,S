Well, I, for myself, didn't needed ACPI for my desktops/servers - they 
were/are working fine without it. When I've dumped processing power for 
mobility, however - as much power management as possible is (almost) a 
requirement (for me). How/where could I find your fix to test (yes, I'm 
reading acpi-devel, but installing bitkeeper to pull these 'assorted fixes' 
is somewhat like an overkill. Diff ?)

Yes. Doesn't helps (well, my particular problem is miniPCI 3c556 fails to be 
detected properly with ACPI enabled. Seems base io addr is detected 
incorrectly, and subsequent calls to read data return 0xFF instead of actual 
values. I've posted message here few days ago, and I didn't intend to repost 
it, but this discussion took me by heart.).
> system? Have you checked bugzilla for similar bugs? Have you sent a
Yes. Nothing similar (I'm wondering if ThinkPad T2x series are so unpopular 
among linux users/developers, and nobody stepped on this bug before, or I'm 
so very special...).

Well, 3c59x driver source is 100K of tightly hardware-bound code (as almost 
every other driver). Looks I'll need another three or four months just to 
grok what's happening there - I'm not a Donald Becker (:-)

Well. Probably. Is there some kind of ACPI HCL ?
