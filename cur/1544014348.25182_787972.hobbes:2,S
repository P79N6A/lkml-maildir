Argh, missed some questions I should've answered earlier...

I suspect it would work and it would avoid the layering violation you

You make some good points here. I'll add your idea to my list of patches
to try writing:
	1. Store a reference to the uts namespace with the credentials
	2. Pass the nodename directly for each RPC call (via rpc_message
		perhaps)

I addressed your other comments in an earlier reply.
Thanks!
