No, you miss the point.  If people are having to use <linux/soundcard.h> at 
the moment that suggests that there are ioctl definitions or something else 
system-specific that is needed by user space.  This could be a candidate for 
inclusion into libc if that would be an advantage.  Nobody is suggesting 
including full sound functionality into libc -- that would clearly be absurd.
