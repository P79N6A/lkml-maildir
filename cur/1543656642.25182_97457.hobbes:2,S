My apologies. The patch (as I've heard from hch) has gone out separately.
Thanks to both gregkh and chris for rapid responses, and many apologies
from me wrt. my uninformed responses.
For the majority of -lsm users: This was an API update. No semantic
differences wrt. bugs or other issues should be visible. Thank you
for your patience, and I apologize in advance for my ignorance. Rest
assured in the fact that my changes are not critical to your security
correctness and that chris and gregkh have been thorough, diligent
and highly responsive wrt. the incorporation of this API update along
with your essential security updates.
Thanks,
Bill
