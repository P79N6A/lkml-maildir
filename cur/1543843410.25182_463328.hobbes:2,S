We in systemtap land hope to encounter *some* static tracepoint
structure, perhaps like the one I presented at OLS, via which
systemtap could become your unified static+dynamic "infrastructure".
Even in that universe, using LTT-derived code for high-performance
tracing is within the realm of reason.

I'm sorry to hear you dislike the scripting language.  But that's
okay, you Real Men can embed literal C code inside systemtap scripts
to do the Real Work, and leave to systemtap only sundry duties such as
probe placement and removal.
