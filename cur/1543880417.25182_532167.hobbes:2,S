ok, i get it now and -- correct me if i'm wrong -- all my legacy PM
removal patch was doing was exposing a design boo-boo in which
APM/ACPI contention was being handled by a macro in a subsystem even
older than either of them, right?  so all that needs to be done is add
back in a contention solution of some kind that doesn't rely on that
ancient system, yes?
as for that thinkpad t30 situation, well, that's just borked, and
should be fixed.

p.s.  at the risk of repeating myself repetitively, do we now agree
that what i was trying to remove *was* adequately ancient?  although
it's clear that it has to be done slightly more carefully than was
done in my initial patch.
p.p.s.  patch improvements that will let me avoid doing any of that
myself always welcome. :-)
