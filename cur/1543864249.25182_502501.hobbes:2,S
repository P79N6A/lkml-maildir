Applications which syncronize their data integrity
by keeping data on hard drive and relying on
"read goes to bare metal, so it can't see written data
before it gets written to bare metal". Wow, this is slow.
Are you talking about this scenario:
Bad:
	fd = open(..., O_SYNC);
	fork()
	write(fd, buf); [1]
        ....                   read(fd, buf2); [starts after write 1 started]
        ....                   write(somewhere_else, buf2);
        ....                   (write returns)
        .... <---- crash point
        (write returns)
This will be *very* slow - if you use O_DIRECT and do what
is depicted above, you write data, then you read it back,
whic is slow. Why do you want that? Isn't it
much faster to just wait for write to complete, and allow
read to fetch (potentially) cached data?
Better:
	fd = open(..., O_SYNC);
	fork()
	write(fd, buf); [1]
        ....                   (wait for write to finish)
        ....
        ....
        .... <---- crash point
        (write returns)
        ....                   read(fd, buf2); [starts after write 1 started]
        ....                   write(somewhere_else, buf2);
        ....                   (write returns)

Not all, only related i/o.
