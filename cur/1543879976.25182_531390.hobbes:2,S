Sorry, 'it' didn't work...  'It' *never* did.

You're defending a position which itself left users with a false sense
of security and comfort.  This is a *real* problem from an enterprise
perspective where FC reigns.  Fine, I'll agree that wacking-users (and
I'll wager the outliers) with a 2x4 was a bit extreme, but I'd much
rather handle those users on a case-by-case basis, either by:
* If dealing with a PCI card, directing a user  to a support staff at
  QLogic to resolve the NVRAM issues.
* If it's some on-board ISP with no NVRAM, as was your SPARC case,
  then add *proper* codes to retrieve the data from some secondary
  persistent store.
