I've also been running 2.2.4 on a Redhat 5.2 system running on a relatively
busy Compaq 1850R (dual PII-450) for a couple of days.  No crashes or
unexpected behaviour.  It's really really fast.  My seat of the pants method
of real world performance measurement is to time the compilation of a
piggy program like emacs.  Snarfing emacs-20.3 and doing a make -j all,
completed the task in 57 seconds.  Yow!  That's more than 2.5X  as fast
as the dual PPro-200 850R's that I had been using at the office.  And it
probably could have been faster.  The limiting factor seemed to be the
system waiting for disk IO to complete (on a pair of hot swappable
4.3gig 7200rpm drives).
