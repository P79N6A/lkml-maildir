Note that something needs to get moving on this rsn, I'm not interested in
getting aio patches on Oct 30th. The feature freeze may be on Halloween,
but if I get some big feature just days before I'm likely to just say
"screw it".
I think we can still change the stuff in 2.5.x, but I really want to start
seeing some code, so that I'm not taken by surprise by something that
obviously sucks.
Is there any activity on linux-aio? I haven't heard anything since Ottawa.
