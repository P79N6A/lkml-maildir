What I did was to pull, then diff against my working tree (/me=SCM
weenie;) for review as usual, and then apply that diff to working tree
and make oldconfig as usual.  That left me with the same failure this
morning, despite the file being verified present in the git tree.  I
then used git-archive --format=tar | (cd work_tree;tar -xvf -).  That
spewed chunks when I tried to build it even though diff said the trees
were identical.  After make mrproper and restoring my saved .config, all
was peachy.
Methinks dontdiff bit me.
