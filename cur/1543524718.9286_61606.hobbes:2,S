I have two machines that run fine with kernel 2.0.36 or below. When I
build either a 2.0.37 or 2.0.38 kernel, however, they both hang at
"Now booting the kernel". I've tried rebuilding the kernel in a variety
of different ways to no success.
Machine 1 is:
   Dual 200Mhz/512K PPro
   96MB RAM
   Buslogic BT-958 SCSI controller
   3Com 3C905 ethernet
   Matrox Millenium video
   SoundBlaster 16
   Roland SCC-1 (MPU-401)
Machine 2 is:
   100 Mhz Pentium
   64 MB RAM
   Buslogic BT-946C SCSI controller
   3Com 3C509 ethernet
   S3 964-based video
Any syggestions?
