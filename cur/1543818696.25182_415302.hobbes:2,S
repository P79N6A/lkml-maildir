Indeed.
On top of that, they're `only' local DoSes, so many admins (i.e. those
without untrusted local users) will probably not have installed .3 yet:
and anyone with untrusted local users probably has someone whose entire
job is handling security anyway.
There's nothing wrong with rapid-fire -stables; either the issue is (in
the judgement of the ones doing the installation) critical, in which
case it should get out as fast as possible, or it isn't, in which case
the local installing admins can put it off for a day or so themselves to
see if another release comes out immediately afterwards.
