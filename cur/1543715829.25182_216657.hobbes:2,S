As far as I can see from here, evms parsed partition table, called
dmsetup several times and created corresponding nodes in /dev/evms.
Thus we allowed to mount /dev/evms/hda1 but /dev/hda1 stopped working.
That's why it did not released hda - because it has active devmapper
on top.

Logic is easy - evms trying to concentrate block device management
into its own hands, but we have in-kernel partitioning code to
consider ...
