This is a general comment that applies across your entire patchset.
It would be a lot easier to review the patchset if you put the Docbook
description of the function with the .c file instead of the .h file.
This will also make it much more likely that when you or other people
update the code function, that the documentation will get updated as
well.
I'd recommend doing this along with combining all of your *.h files
into a ubi_private.h and ubi.h file.
