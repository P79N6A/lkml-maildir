I got a tip to use the "psmouse_noext" kernel option, and
that solved the two latter problems: the mouse is now simply
recognized as a generic PS/2 mouse, and it doesn't go bonkers
after a suspend/resume cycle. Kernel 2.5.67.
The first problem remains: in console mode (not X), the
sensitivity is still way down compared to 2.4 kernels.
Is there a way to adjust that?
