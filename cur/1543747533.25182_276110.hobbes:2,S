The suckitude of C++ compilers is only part of the issues.

The way the kernel will deal with C++ language being a complete
disaster (where something as simple as "a = b + c + d +e" could
involve a dozen or more memory allocations, implicit type conversions,
and overloaded operators) is to not use it.  Think about the words of
wisdom from the movie Wargames: "The only way to win is not to play
the game".
