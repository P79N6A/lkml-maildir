Well, let's say it puts back the original behaviour. If you look at even
the NUMA code before these changes, it had cpu_possible_map in there.
I totally agree about fixing NUMA, it looks completely broken to me in
the way it handles cpu maps because node_to_cpumask(i) needs to expand
to cpu_possible_map for initialisation and cpu_online_map for
operation.  Has anyone ever checked NUMA for hotplug CPU?
