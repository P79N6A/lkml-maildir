It does indeed work with dri disabled in xorg.conf, as explained by Dave
Airlie in previous post.
the only modules loaded starting xorg are:
Module                  Size  Used by
appletalk              27696  2
ax25                   45784  2
ipx                    21164  2
radeon                 94112  0
this of course on 2.6.15, since 2.6.16 completely hangs, and no other info
can be gathered.
