Nobody I know of, in the U.K. is doing that.
Note, though, that DSL is theoretically capable of about 8 Mbit, so I
don't see any reason why it would not be possible to have 1 Mbit,
burstable to 8 Mbit.
Also, note that with leased lines, you will typically need a different
type of circuit above 2 Mbit, so it's not just the cost of bandwidth.
John.
