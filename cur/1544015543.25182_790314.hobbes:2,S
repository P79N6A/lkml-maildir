Umm. No. 
Time is exactly what makes it useful. It will make all the downsides 
shrink, and the advantages stay.

Well, you don't actually have to mark that semi-random one as good either. 
What you can do is to just mark anything that _only_ contains fs/btrfs as 
good. IOW, you don't have to know the magic number - you just have to be 
told that "oh, if you only have btrfs files, and you're not actively 
bisecting a btrfs bug, just do 'git bisect good' and continue".
Yeah, you'll hit it a few times, but you don't even have to compile things 
or boot anything, so it's not actually going to be all that much slower 
than just knowing about the magic point either.
So now you can consider yourself told how to solve it. It wasn't that 
hard. And the advantage is that we have real history.
