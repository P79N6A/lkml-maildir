Thanx for the suggestion, but it unfortunately doesn't appear to have
made any difference. :-( The full kernel command-line was
"acpismp=force hdc=cdrom hdd=cdrom" (hdc is a DVD-ROM, and hdd is a
CD-RW).
   # mount /cdrom
   mount: /dev/hdc is not a valid block device
   # grep ide /proc/modules
   # mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /cdrom
   mount: /dev/hdc is not a valid block device
   # modprobe ide-cd
   end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 0
   hdc: ATAPI 48X DVD-ROM drive, 512kB Cache, UDMA(33)
   Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.12
   end_request: I/O error, dev hdd, sector 0
   hdd: ATAPI 48X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
   # mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /cdrom
   mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
   ISO 9660 Extensions: Microsoft Joliet Level 3
   ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
I can't find any messages under /var/log or dmesg to indicate that a
module load was attempted for block-major-22 (or anything else, for
that matter).
I appreciate the suggestion, tho!
