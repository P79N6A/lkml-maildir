I also have an SDDR-31.  My best experiences with it have been,
well, horrible.  But the same is true of that device under
WinBlows 2000 or XP.
Last time I used it was 2.5.6x something (I patched the bios
on the device that uses flash to allow me to load a new linux
image to the flash in situ.)  I guess I'll try again.
