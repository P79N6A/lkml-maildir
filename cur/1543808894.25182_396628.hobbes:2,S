I did describe this in detail before:
some drives complain about "illegal field in cdb"
with "read full toc" and "blank" while the same HW booted
with Solaris or SCO UnixWare has no problems.
Let me write a final remark:
cdrecord currently has no known Linux specific bug.
Let us comtinue to talk after the Linux kernel bugs that
prevent cdrecord from working have been fixed.
