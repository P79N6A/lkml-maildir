The only thing bogus is the CONFIG_EMBEDDED use itself, if it were only
limited to turning options off, you'd be correct, but both PCI and IDE
use it for other things. We specifically wanted it for IDE in this case.
I'd be quite happy to see CONFIG_EMBEDDED separated entirely from the
"advanced/expert/screwing aunt tillie" selection menu, or whatever we're
choosing to call it these days. Then we wouldn't have to deal with these
confusing defconfigs that expose far more than most users are going to
care about.
There are a number of other architectures that do this too, so it may be
worth separating so we can finally get rid of the confusion.
