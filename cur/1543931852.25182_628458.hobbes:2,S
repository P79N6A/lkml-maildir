Greetings;
When I asked about a sata controller earlier this week, I gave a link to it.  
Unforch (maybe) when it actually arrived, the cards box showed a silicon 
image chip, and the card had a via.  So much for getting what I ordered...
The required module then was sata_via, not sata_uli, and it seems to be 
working ok.  However, this one claims its a raid controller according to an 
lspci -v:
01:0a.0 RAID bus controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6421 IDE RAID Controller 
(rev 50)
        Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6421 IDE RAID Controller
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 19
        I/O ports at 9400 [size=16]
        I/O ports at 9800 [size=16]
        I/O ports at 9c00 [size=16]
        I/O ports at a000 [size=16]
        I/O ports at a400 [size=32]
        I/O ports at a800 [size=256]
        [virtual] Expansion ROM at e9000000 [disabled] [size=64K]
        Capabilities: [e0] Power Management version 2
I just noted that the Expansion ROM is disabled, but I didn't see any jumpers 
to enable it on the card prior to installing it.  Does anyone know how this 
is supposed to work?  I would like to make it directly bootable but I believe 
this has to be 'enabled' for that.
I cannot find any references to this particular chip in a 'make xconfig' for 
2.6.24-rc5.
Should this be a concern, or is this one a 'Just Works(TM)' chipset?  This 
card has 3 sata port connectors and one ide fitted.
Two rather pleasant side effects of going to the Biostar.tw site and finding a 
newer bios and installing it on an M7NCD Pro mobo are:
1: FSB now running at 400MHZ, was 333 before as it was not at all stable at 
400 and I have been told the XP-2800 Athlon only supports 333 and AMD's site 
agrees.
2: CPU temps are down around 13F.  CPU speed still the same at 2079MHZ 
according to dmesg.
The reduced temps at a higher FSB indicates better interface timing, and if it 
runs the rest of the night at 400 without a self reboot or crash, I'll leave 
it there.
