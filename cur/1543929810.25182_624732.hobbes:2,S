As I said, I don't think leaving duplicate lines in a file which will be
installed, distributed and used widely is the RTTD.  There can be other
uses of the file.  For example, the file can be parsed and modified by
distro specific module selector.  Sure, all of them can be made to deal
with dup entries but that's just not the right place to solve the problem.

Some subdir-y|m entries have following / while others don't.  subdir-y|m
are lax about because either way it points to subdirectory.  The above
two lines are to normalize them so that there's no surprises when
concatenating file name to it.  I think it's a good idea to have the
above with or without other changes.

Yeah, it depends on config.  If you don't have subdir-y|m entries which
don't have following '/', it will work just fine.  If you do, it will break.

This I dunno much about.

I didn't know that.  Is it forced that modules can't be put in
subdir-y|m directories?  What happens if I do that?

e.g. Some of USB modules are listed twice in config.  They'll appear twice.

Ah.. that looks much less hacky.  Thanks.  I'll submit an updated
version as soon as above issues are settled.
Thanks.
