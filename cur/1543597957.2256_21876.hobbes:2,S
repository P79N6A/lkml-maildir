Subject: linux-2.4.9: atomic_dec_and_lock sometimes used while not defined

	If I try to build a kernel that can do SMP and run on a 386,
the linux-2.4.9 NFS client gets compiled with an undefined reference
to atomic_dec_and_lock().  I imagine that the correct fix is to
change the ifdefs that bracket the following line in include/linux/spinlock.h:
#define atomic_dec_and_lock(atomic,lock) atomic_dec_and_test(atomic)
	However, I'm really not clear enough on the semantics of
atomic_dec_and_lock vs. atomic_dec_and_test to know whether this
is safe.
	Also, it looks like arch/sparc64/sparc64_ksyms.c references
atomic_dec_and_test without it every being defined on any architecture
other than x86, so I am suspicious of a partially applied patch here.
	If nobody has a better idea, I'm going to move the
#define statement that I mentioned above out of its current
ifdef logic and just bracket it like so:
#ifndef CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK
#define atomic_dec_and_lock(atomic,lock) atomic_dec_and_test(atomic)
#endif
