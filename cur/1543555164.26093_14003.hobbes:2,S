It'ld be nice if you at least CC'ed your mail to the maintainers, i.e. the
isdn4linux people, because not everyone has the time to follow l-k.
Any way, I CC'ed isdn4linux@listserv.isdn4linux.de now, and this thread
should continue there.
Could you please clarify which problems you have? You state that the utils
seem to be out of sync with kernels < 2.2.16, but you need to patch them
for kernels > 2.2.17 ?
I just tried the latest "release" of the utils,
isdn4k-utils.v3.1pre1.tar.gz, and the current CVS version against
2.2.18pre22, and they compile fine. Note that binary compatibility didn't
break during 2.2, only for 2.4. (I.e. utils compiled on 2.2 will complain
if used with 2.4, utils compiled on 2.4 will work on either kernel series)
I'm sure, if you provide more details, and the exact error message you're
seeing, we'll find a solution.
