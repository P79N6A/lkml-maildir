Well, I will have to maintain it, and I'm perfectly willing to. I only 
started to work on it in the first place because I wanted to use it, so I 
have a vested interest in keeping it working. So... even if we end up 
pulling it out in place of a userspace solution, I really like the idea of 
putting it in at least until uswsusp is up to speed (provided it didn't 
given Andrew and/or Linus a hernia in the process).
To avoid the backwards compatability issues, we can plan ahead now, 
defining something like I suggested in another email earlier in the day.
Regards,
Nigel
