You're asking the wrong question. The right question would be:
"Is there any good reason to drop support for older compilers?"
At least on i386, gcc-2.95.3 still works and has the advantage
of being much faster compile-time wise on older machines with
limited memory (like my 486 test box). And I'm not the only
one with that POV -- akpm also uses 2.95.
Of course, if keeping 2.95.3 support would somehow hinder the
kernel's development, then it should be removed. But so far I
haven't seen any real(*) evidence that this is the case.
(*) Moronic code with declarations after statements is not a
valid argument against 2.95.
