Both because I find the name not as expressive as simple "BIT(x % 
something)", but mainly since it only enables wrapping of the long-type. 
But that is just my opinion.
Just to test:
> grep -Enr "BIT\(.*\%" *
include/asm-arm/arch-h720x/irqs.h:114:#define IRQ_TO_BIT(irq) (1 << ((irq - NR_GLBL_IRQS) % 32))
include/asm-arm/arch-omap/irqs.h:274:#define OMAP_IRQ_BIT(irq)  (1 << ((irq) % 32))
include/asm-i386/mach-visws/piix4.h:17:#define  GPIBIT(x)               (1 << ((x)%8))
include/linux/netfilter/xt_conntrack.h:11:#define XT_CONNTRACK_STATE_BIT(ctinfo) (1 << ((ctinfo)%IP_CT_IS_REPLY+1))
include/linux/netfilter/xt_state.h:4:#define XT_STATE_BIT(ctinfo) (1 << ((ctinfo)%IP_CT_IS_REPLY+1))
...
So it seems there are some instances who wrap but they don't seem to 
like BITSWAP (well, maybe those "% 32" on an appropriate arch).
So I think that if an subsystem uses something like this much (like 
input.h), then it is up to that subsystem to provide it. When more then 
one sub-system have a need for it, then it should be a common define (as 
BIT is now). But as I said, that is just my opinion.
