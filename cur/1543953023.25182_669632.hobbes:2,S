It just seems to be oscillating. The following is a series of
 consecutive hdparm -t (when one is finished, I hit up-arrow
 and then Enter again):
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   86 MB in  3.01 seconds =  28.57 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   88 MB in  3.00 seconds =  29.30 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   92 MB in  3.04 seconds =  30.31 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   88 MB in  3.05 seconds =  28.86 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   98 MB in  3.03 seconds =  32.38 MB/sec
hdb is definitely more stable...
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  108 MB in  3.02 seconds =  35.79 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  110 MB in  3.03 seconds =  36.36 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  110 MB in  3.04 seconds =  36.24 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/hdb
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  110 MB in  3.04 seconds =  36.24 MB/sec
Though I only have light activity on /dev/hda - four torrents
 uploading at a cumulative 33KB/s via bittorrent-4.4.0-2
 (and no activity on /dev/hdb).
/dev/sda, the USB external storage, is mounted but currently
 not really accessed. However, the slowdown for me did
 appear even modprob'ing ehci_hcd - without even mounting
 /dev/sda.
Oh, now that you make me look... /dev/sda hdparm -t dropped
 from 22MB/s to ~16MB/s - see my email of a while ago
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2006-10/msg09679.html
 versus the current
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   48 MB in  3.02 seconds =  15.90 MB/sec
[root@donkey ~]# hdparm -t /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:   48 MB in  3.02 seconds =  15.90 MB/sec
