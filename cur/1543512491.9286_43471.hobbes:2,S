I heard you the first time..........sheesh.....
Yes it is going to be messy and long......
I am going to be out of pocket for two or three weeks during a
transition/relocation............so any initial grunt work would be
useful.  Since the old guard is now effectively gone and not to return,
I dread going back into history to try and catch the races during the
introduction of SMP........2.1.90 -> 95 was the intro date/kernel.
Recall that it was around 2.1.122 that offered to pick up the pieces and
go.......Thus I have been playing catchup from before day one.
So how about easing up on the heavies........
I am cussing at it now as that 2.3.20 is IDE dead........
