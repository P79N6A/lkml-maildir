Subject: BUG 2.3.23-pre5 locks up

With a fairly standard .config, 2.3.23-pre5 locks up after a few minutes
of usage.
Symptoms include standard programs working ok (I was able to load X,
Netscape, and several xterms) for a while, then programs start gettting
mysterious segmentation faults.  Specifically, I
* booted RH 6.0
* loaded X
* loaded Netscape and xterms
* ran 'cvs import' -- segfault
* ran 'strace cvs import' -- strace shows segfault in access() syscall
[warning - may be red herring]
* ran 'bzcat foo.tar.bz2 | tar xf -' -- segfault
* a few seconds later, hard lockup
.config attached.
