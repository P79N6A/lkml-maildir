So long as the mapping exists, the data should not disappear.  So a
MAP_PRIVATE mapping should behave just like a MAP_SHARED mapping, and
both need to be fixed to not lose data due to madvise(MADV_DONTNEED).
(I agree with Joern, MADV_FREE seems like an ill-advised extension.)
If this means some swap needs to be allocated, well, so be it.
