The ThinkPad, Toshiba, and both Dells work correctly for both shutdown and
suspend (via the apm -s) using 2.4. I haven't tried the ACER, it's new and
started life with FC2 and a 2.6 kernel. It does power down correctly, and
suspend, but doesn't resume so it's not very useful.
I would complain with details, but the older laptops are now out of
production, so I am not going to ask someone to divert time to making
things work on them. The ACER is my current ride along, I would like to
suspend that.
