We've got two nfsd patches that fix a regression and a possible oops, so
both should probably go in before the 2.6.23 release.
Patches will follow, but they're also available from "for-linus" at:
  ssh://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/exports/linux.git for-linus
--b.
Neil Brown (2):
      knfsd: Fixed problem with NFS exporting directories which are mounted on.
      knfsd: Validate filehandle type in fsid_source
