I had completely forgotten about the C1E problem, which we debugged
half a year ago on 32bit. I went through the other pitfalls we had in
32bit carefully again and they are all covered on 64 bit too. C1E was
the only one I missed.
The irq0 problem is not a real one. The clock events code has no irq0 
bound to cpuX assumption at all. The only affected part is nmi_watchdog 
and I have a fix ready to handle this even for the irq#0 not on cpu#0 
case.
