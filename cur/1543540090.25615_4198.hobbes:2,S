Like this.  No need for a pad field, gcc automatically pads the
structure to the correct size.
typedef struct {
        unsigned int __local_irq_count;
        unsigned int __local_bh_count;
        unsigned int __nmi_counter;
} ____cacheline_aligned irq_cpustat_t;
____cacheline_aligned is defined in linux/cache.c.
#define ____cacheline_aligned __attribute__((__aligned__(SMP_CACHE_BYTES)))
SMP_CACHE_BYTES defaults to L1_CACHE_BYTES.  L1_CACHE_BYTES is defined 
in asm/cache.c; some arch's hard code it, others pick it up from a
CONFIG variable which depends on the machine type.
