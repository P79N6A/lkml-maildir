Hi, 
sorry if this already have been discussed.
I noticed that message at boot time about kernel code, data and init
memory shows 0k. Quick look in ...arch/i386/mm/init.c shows that in
mem_init() variables codepages, datapages, initpages and reservedpages
are initialized with 0 and these values remain unchanged until they are
printed.
Is this made on purpose or i miss something?
I can't find anything that harm in the loop counting the pages.
regards,
Petkan
