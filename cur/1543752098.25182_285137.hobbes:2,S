Since it's a bit off-topic for LKML it's being discussed off-list. The 
problem was with the DNS servers. Since the mail server could not 
determine SPF status for the domain it returned a temporary error 
(hoping that the DNS problem would get resolved).
So the situation is more towards 1). The mail is valid, but there is a 
DNS (or firewall) misconfigured somewhere.
