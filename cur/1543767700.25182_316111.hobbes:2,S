The kernel doesn't do SIGSTOP or SIGCONT. Within init, there is
a SIGSTOP and SIGCONT handler. These can be inherited by others
unless changed, perhaps by a 'C' runtime library. Basically,
the SIGSTOP handler executes pause() until the SIGCONT signal
is received.
Any delay in stopping is the time necessary for the signal to
be delivered. It is possible that the section of code that
contains the STOP/CONT handler was paged out and needs to be
paged in before the signal can be delivered.
You might quicken this up by installing your own handler for
SIGSTOP and SIGCONT....
static int stp;
static void contsig(int sig)	// SIGCONT handler
{
    stp = 0;
}
static void stopsig(int sig)  // SIGSTOP handler
{
     stp = 1;
     while(stp)
         pause();
}
Put this near the code that will be executing most of the time.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
