Not in its current state, but it can certainly be modified to do so.
The embedded gdb module never is even aware of the vmcore file.
(It is essentially executed as "gdb vmlinux").
And currently crash only expects a single PT_LOAD section, but
that's due for a change.  It's been OK for its current set of supported
processors to use sparse file space for non-existent memory,
but it's kind of a pain with ia64's 256GB holes.
The point is that adapting crash to handle whatever format
you come up with is the easy part of the whole equation.

Are you asking about what would be the p_vaddr values for the higher
memory segments?   FWIW, with the single-PT_LOAD segment currently
supported by crash, there's only one p_vaddr, but in any case, crash doesn't
use it, so PAE is not a problem.
