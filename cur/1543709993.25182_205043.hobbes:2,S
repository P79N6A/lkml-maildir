the quality of such objrmap patch is still better than rmap. The DoS
thing is doable with vmtruncate too in any kernel out there.
merging objrmap is the first step. Any other effort happens on top of
it.
I never said this was finished with objrmap, I said since the first
place that it was the building block.

mainline is worthless without objrmap even if you don't run into swap,
at least with objrmap it works unless you push the machine into swap.
