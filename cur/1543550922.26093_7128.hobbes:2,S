Thanks, both works fine. To understand the reason for this change I've
browsed the discussion on l-k when it was introduced in 2.3.4x.
My impression is, there are two approaches (RFC1122 vs. BSD) which are
mutually exclusive and could be attributed as broken from the respective
point of view.
I'm just going to formulate an idea I have not to solve but to work around
this ambiguity and retain maximum compatibility and honor both sides of
the story :)

Martin
