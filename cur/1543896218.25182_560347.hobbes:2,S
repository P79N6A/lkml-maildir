I wouldn't. As far as I'm concerned everything in drivers/cdrom except 
viocd.c and cdrom.c itself can go, assuming I'll be allowed to bring back 
support for the legacy cdrom types I'd still like to have supported -- in 
the first place mitsumi (mcdx), panasonic (sbpcd) and sony (cdu31a) and 
perhaps at some point other types if/when I happen across the hardware.
The old drivers serve as a source of hardware information but at least mcdx 
was broken in so many ways that it only did so at the source level. When I 
wanted to check throughput with the old driver I actually had to go back as 
far as 2.0.34 to find a working driver (the old mcd.c, already removed since 
2.6.10). 2.0.34 sources are available from kernel.org, and 2.6.22 sources 
even from my local machine...

... which, by the way, is still waiting on comment from anyone with a clue 
as to why it makes the machine go boom (easily repeatable when using CFQ, 
not or not easily when using AS):
