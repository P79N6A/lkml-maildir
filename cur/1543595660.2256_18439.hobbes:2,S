Is there a standard way to make multiple copies of a network device?
For things like the bonding/ipip/ip_gre and others they seem to expect
insmod -o copy1 module.o
insmod -o copy2 module.o
It seems to me that this will waste space creating copies of all the 
static data.
Then there are things like ipsec that create a few static net_dev
structures, but I have no idea how they deal with more entries. 
They probably don't.
The PCI drivers seem to be pretty clean with init_one type functions.
Is there anything similar for generic hardware-less network devices.
I would hate to have write an ioctl to create a new device without
loading a module twice.
