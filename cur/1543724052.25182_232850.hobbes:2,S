Noted. The amount of swap hardly has any effect on the swappiness except 
when you're close to OOMing and it is harder to OOM with this in place.

I agree and would like them all removed, but people just love to leave the 
knobs in place. While I dont think the knobs should still be there either, 
I'm not reluctant to leave something that innocuous if the users want them.
