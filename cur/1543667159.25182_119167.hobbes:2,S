	Ok, I think we're having a terminology problem here.  I wasn't
aware that "CLOCK_MONOTONIC" was a POSIX thing, I merely thought you
were speaking of a kconf define for the proposed monotonic_clock()
interface.  That interface is a portable and consistent wrapper around
access to things like the TSC and the cyclone timer.  Maybe it needs
renaming.
