Subject: [PATCH] i386, x86-64: show that CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is required for suspend on SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/20/170

From: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>
It's not sufficiently documented that CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is required for
suspend/hibernation on SMP.
Point out the non-obvious.
