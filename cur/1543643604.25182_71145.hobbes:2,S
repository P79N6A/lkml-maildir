I think VDMA is an extra feature, the old PIO will still remain - it has
to, for other register accesses, and the data port is not much
different.

No. The controller is always tuned for both PIO and DMA. This is a must
- not all commands are DMA (eg IDENTIFY) and for for example ATAPI some
data is sent over PIO and some over DMA even for a single command. So
using PIO when the drive is switched to DMA is perfectly OK.

Legacy free? That is wishful thinking. Not going to happen any soon.
Unfortunately. As for DMA vs PIO, see above.

Retuning not needed, LBA48 might be needed. Not sure about LBA48 in PIO
mode, it might work even without chipset support - it's usually the
LBA48+DMA combination that confuses the chips.
