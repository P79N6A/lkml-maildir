What's this mean? Something distinct from periodic timer?

I am not convinced this is a problem. I would like to see evidence
that it is a problem, but I have only seen assertions.
Definitely it is not uncontrollable. And not unchangeable. It is
about the least sensitive part of the allocator because in a serious
workload, the queues will continually be bounded by watermarks rather
than timer reaping.

You mean due to lower order allocations?
1. I have not seen any results showing this gives a practical performance
   increase, let alone one that offsets the downsides of using higher
   order allocations.
2. Increased internal fragmentation may also have the opposite effect and
   result in worse packing.
3. There is no reason why SLQB can't use higher order allocations if this
   is a significant win.

I see no reason why this should be a problem. The SLUB merge just asserted
it would be a problem. But actually SLAB seems to handle it just fine, and
SLUB also doesn't always obey memory policies, so I consider that to be a
worse problem, at least until it is justified by performance numbers that
show otherwise.

The queues expire slowly. Same as SLAB's arrays. You are describing the
implementation, and not the problems it has.

That needs a little bit of work, but my primary focus is to come up
with a design that has competitive performance in the most important
cases.
There needs to be some fallback cases added to slowpaths to handle
these things, but I don't see why it would take much work.

It is _like_ slab. It avoids the major drawbacks of large footprint of
array caches, and O(N^2) memory consumption behaviour, and corner cases
where scalability is poor. The queueing behaviour of SLAB IMO is not
a drawback and it is a big reaon why SLAB is so good.

The goal is to replace SLAB and SLUB. Anything less would be a failure
on behalf of SLQB. Shared code is not a bad thing, but the major problem
is the actual core behaviour of the allocator because it affects almost
everywhere in the kernel and splitting userbase is not a good thing.
