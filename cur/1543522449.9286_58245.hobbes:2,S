Umm - Linux doesn't adjust Power supply voltage levels and it doesn't swap
new serial line driver IC's in place either :-))
You have made __double__ shure you didn't connect two output lines together
(eg. TxD from computer to TxD from your device)? And you also checked your
GND connection?

Yes, they _do_ behave equally :)

...and have booted DOS on the very same computer with the very same ISA-boards
and your device?
How did you build the power supply of your device? An external AC-powersupply 
('Netzteil') or from some unused 'to be set to 12V' status lines? If the 
latter, are they set to 'high level' when you connect your device?

Keine Ursache!
