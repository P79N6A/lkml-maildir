Thanks
Earlier today I didn't take v0.19 today from You're page, but patched 
previous v0.19 with Your patch posted to linux-kernel mailing list yesterday 
evening.
Now about v0.20. Seems that it survives following torture:
- setup artsd to close /dev/dsp after 1 second idle
-  running something like 
	while true; do artsplay beep.wav; sleep 3s; done
Kernel version 2.4.18-pre3
Only one purely cosmetical patch to avoid unnecessary warning from gcc
(I used gcc-2.95.3):
