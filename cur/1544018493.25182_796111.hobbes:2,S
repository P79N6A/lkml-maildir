This is incorrect. The adding the lock and unlock will not make the
system more pre-emptive. To be more pre-emptive you'd want to check
need_resched() as often as possible.

Again. This is incorrect. Rescheduling if need_resched() will prevent
softlockup.
Not sure what I was thinking this morning;)
However, I am happy with the patch. To give writers a chance, the lock
should held for bounded time. Holding the lock in khungtask (which is
running at low scheduler priority) could potentially be delaying
important work. The longer the lock is held, the bigger the priority
inversion problem.
