But module-init-tools is *not* supposed to read this; that code is a 2.4 
backwards compatibility layer which should be removed (and certainly not 
enhanced to cover new types in mod_devicetable.h!).
I repeat: this is *only* for the internal modpost code.

Not if it makes the code (even) more obscure.  Put an attribute((packed)) on 
every structure and add an explanation at the top of the file if it makes you 
feel safer (new additions to the file are likely to copy existing ones), and 
that's sufficient.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
