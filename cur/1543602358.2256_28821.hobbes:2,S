Do not apply, there are better much solutions already:
1)
  This chip and much more is already handled (usermode)by:
  
http://home.t-online.de/home/gunther.mayer/lssuperio-0.63.tar.gz
2) 
  PNPBIOS is superior at detecting your parallel port !
  I asked the parport maintainer to remove superio from the kernel
  when PNPBIOS makes it into the kernel.
  PNPBIOS is not only a lifesaver on certain laptops (hanging otherwise)
  but too on parallel port configuration which is currently a curse.
  Drawback: Alan knows machines with bugs in their pnpbioses.
