Interesting, so stepping 10 is OK?

so is it a glibc bug or CPU bug?

You could search for CMOV instructions on your system,
which could cause wierdness, like:
find / -perm +111 -type f |
while read bin; do
     objdump --disassemble $bin 2>/dev/null |
     grep -q cmov && echo "$bin has cmov"
done
Note C3 Nehemiah do have CMOV (but no 3dnow).
