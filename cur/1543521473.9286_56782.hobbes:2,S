 This appears to fix the oops in isapnp_create_device at boot:

 I noticed another patch that had the INIT_LIST_HEAD lower down in
the same function: it doesn't work because the card->devices list
head is accessed earlier, in isapnp_create_devices, causing the
oops (that's where EIP points in the oops, anyway).
