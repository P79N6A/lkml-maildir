Excellent. Jeremy, are you happy for this to go in?

Subject: [PATCH] x86/xen: Do not scan for DMI unless the DMI region is reserved by e820.
Under Xen the memory at 0xf0000 is regular RAM and so can potentially contain a
page table and hence cannot be mapped. The e820 map given to guest reflects
this.
