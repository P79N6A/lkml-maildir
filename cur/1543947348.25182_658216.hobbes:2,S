It would be nice to list some names, too.

> + * detail on either one, we note that spinlocks have the advantage of
> + * lower overhead for short hold locks.  However, they also have a

> + * likewise most spinlock_ts are converted to sleepable rt-mutex derived
> + * locks.  This allows the holder of the lock to remain fully preemptible,
> + * thus reducing a major source of latencies in the kernel.
> + *
> + * However, converting what was once a true spinlock into a sleeping lock
> + * may also decrease performance since the locks will now sleep under
> + * contention.  Since the fundamental lock used to be a spinlock, it is
> + * highly likely that it was used in a short-hold path and that release
> + * is imminent.  Therefore sleeping only serves to cause context-thrashing.
> + *
> + * Adaptive RT locks use a hybrid approach to solve the problem.  They
> + * spin when possible, and sleep when necessary (to avoid deadlock, etc).
> + * This significantly improves many areas of the performance of the -rt
