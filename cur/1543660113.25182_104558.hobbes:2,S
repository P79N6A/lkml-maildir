I think you are ignoring the fact that this clause (#3) in the GPL only
relates only if "you copy or distribute the Program (or a work based on
it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form".

Again you are ignoring the fact that there are other methods by which
the source code is available in the "preferred form", just not quite as
timely as directly from the BK repository (which is itself in a form, SCCS,
which does not require BK to access), and there is nothing in the GPL which
requires that the source be made avaible instantly.
