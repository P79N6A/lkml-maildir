Since I'm using a Duron 600MHz (the lowest model, AFAIK), I decided to
compile a new kernel with the -Os option. Despite the scary warning on the
help, it seems to be working fine for the first few moments with Debian's
testing gcc (3.3.5).
I haven't noticed any other improvement, but I guess that more memory
available to applications would never hurt (as long as stability is
preserved).
I will also try to compile other applications (like Firefox), since my main
memory is so limited and the small cache of my processor would surely
appreciate it.
Perhaps it is time to give the tiny-linux project a try to see what other
optimizations I can achieve.
Just another data point, Rogério.
