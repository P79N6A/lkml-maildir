The kernel has an accepted coding style, both the documented and the
tradition part of it. Using that makes life a lot lot easier for maintaining
the code. Enforcing it there is a good idea, except for special cases
(headers shared with NT has been one example of that).
There are also some nice tools around that will do the first stage import of
a Hungarian NT'ese driver and linuxise it.
