Hmm... Looking around, I wasn't able to find an option in Zebra to do
this.  Do you know the command to do this?

Would this still route packets to destinations which would otherwise be
unreachable, then?  While this isn't a big issue, it would be nice to
stop unroutable traffic before it leaves our networks (mostly in the case
where a customer machine is generating bad traffic).
I did experiment with trying to increase the routing (normal, not cache)
hash table another level, but it didn't seem to have much effect.  I
believe I would have to change the algorithm somewhat to prefer falling
into larger hash buckets sooner than how it does at the moment.  I seem
to recall that it would let the hash buckets get rather large before
expanding them.  I haven't had a chance to look at this very deeply, but
the profile I linked to before does show that fn_hash_lookup() does
indeed use more CPU than any other function, so it may be worth looking
at more.  (Aggregating routes would definitely improve the situation in
any case.)

Yes.  I have fiddled with this before, and making the changes you
suggested actually doubled the load in normal operation.  I would assume
this is putting even more pressure on fn_hash_lookup().
