We need to rewrite the linux kernel in a functional programming language
where partial evaluation of programs is easy :-)
Strictly speaking, tcp/ip code with dynamic partial evaluation did give
some speedup in real tests. I.e. we can hard code the ip addresses and
port numbers (and many othe parameters) after they have been fixed for a
connectin. This connection then gets it own specialised code which is
much simpler and faster.
A far future maybe :(
