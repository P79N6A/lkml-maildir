With a WD My Passport drive (2,5"), I need to use sg_start --stop --pc=3
to stop the disk before unplugging it. Maybe this works with your
drive, too.  This is also required by some Firewire hard disks.  Maybe
the eject command should be extended to use this method, as it is used
also by HAL to eject hotplug devices.
