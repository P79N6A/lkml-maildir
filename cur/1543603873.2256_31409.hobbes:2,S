You're perfectly right that it's not ok for a generic computing
environment to spend lots of cpu in polling, but it is clear that in a
dedicated router/firewall we can just shutdown the NIC interrupt forever via
disable_irq (no matter if the nic supports hw flow control or not, and
in turn no matter if the kid tries to spam the machine with small
packets) and dedicate 1 cpu to the polling-work with ksoftirqd polling
forever the NIC to deliver maximal routing performance or something like
that.  ksoftirqd will ensure fairness with the userspace load as well.
You probably wouldn't get a benefit with tux because you would
potentially lose way too much cpu with true polling and you're traffic
is mostly going from the server to the clients not the othet way around
(plus the clients uses delayed acks etc..), but the world isn't just
tux.
Of course we agree that such a "polling router/firewall" behaviour must
not be the default but it must be enabled on demand by the admin via
sysctl or whatever else userspace API. And I don't see any problem with
that.
