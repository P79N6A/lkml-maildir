Every definition I have seen says that writes to a single memory
location have a serial order as seen by all CPUs, and that a read
will return the most recent write in the sequence (with a bit of
extra mumbo jumbo to cover store queues and store forwarding).
Within such a definition, I don't see how would be allowed for a
single CPU to execute reads out of order and have the second read
return an earlier write than the first read.
