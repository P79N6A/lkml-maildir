Yes, you should use your userspace algorithm to tune the oom killer via
the oom_adj and you can check the effect of your changes with oom_score.
I posted a one liner ugly script to do that a few days ago on l-k.
The oom_adj has this effect on the badness() code:
	/* 
	 * Adjust the score by oomkilladj.
	 */
	if (p->oomkilladj) {
		if (p->oomkilladj > 0)
			points <<= p->oomkilladj;
		else
			points >>= -(p->oomkilladj);
	}
The biggest the points become, the more likely the task will be choosen
by the oom killer.
