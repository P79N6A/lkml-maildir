Correct. I don't know if it was an accident or if it was an
intentional decision, but there doesn't seem to be a way to make the
touchpad operate in relative (compatibility) mode any more.
On the other hand, I don't think there will be any reason to use
relative mode once we have X and gpm support for absolute mode, and
when guest devices are supported.

Yes, use the synclient program to tweak parameters until you find a
setting you like. (I use MinSpeed=0.08 and MaxSpeed=0.10). Then put
them in the XF86Config file. The INSTALL file has an example
InputDevice section that you may want to start from.

I've seen X freeze too. I'll debug it, but it will have to wait a week
until I get back from my vacation.
