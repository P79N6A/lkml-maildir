Ever heard of nmap <

attacks against Linux using old exploits or Windows specific ones? Hiding
versions is /not/ secure. At most marginally so, and the pain for whoever
needs the version for legitimate reasons just isn't worth it.

For /server/ type workloads, where you /need/ stability, you carefully pick
the hardware and then run a selected "enterprise" distro on it. The distro
people do the hard work of keeping your kernel up to date and secure. And
even worry about a smooth upgrade to the next version. For a price, sure.
But either you really need it (and gladly pay the price) or you don't (in
which case you have nothing to complain about).
