The VM was enough of a problem for one flamewar or another.  There is
even a faint memory of major construction work around 2.4.10.
You may be right for an x86 design that work out of the box, but I got
used to extensive adjustments and just as extensive test afterwards.
If those test are successful, the kernel is stable by definition,
whatever the known problems may be.
