Ok, found all 3 of them in this thread and saved them.  From my own 
kmail archive.  Thanks.  I'll merge them into one file and see if it 
will apply when I build the next of Ingo's RT bleeders.

Amen to that!

That tz would be america-chicago in the tz list.  Since I'm a 
(captive) customer, I apparently don't have to go thru that BS. But 
that should be taken care of as I get the impression that my 
whitelisting you should be for *my* incoming.  Give it one more shot 
& see if it still makes a bounce message to you now.  I put your 
domain into the whitelist yesterday.  I also shut off vz's so called 
spam filter as SA seems to be catching far more than theirs ever did.
