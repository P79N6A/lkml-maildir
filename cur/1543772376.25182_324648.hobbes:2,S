We already defined something for recovery that everybody seem to be fine
with and that isn't tied around PCIe specifics. I do not think PCIe is
the ultimate panacea that will replace everything.

Well, our recovery mecanism is intended to be an addition to the
synchronous error detection. If you read carefully my document for
example, I specify places where driver should still do synchronous
detection, especially in some of the recovery phases themselves.
We have agreed a long time ago that a good mecanism for synchronous
detection is to sandwitch IOs that way. The actual implementation may
use AER, pSeries EEH mecanisms, PCI/PCI-X status errors bits (that need
per-segment locks though) etc... depending on the architecture.
Since the actual error information can be very varied, the error
"cookie" was suggested as an opaque way to carry that information and
keep track of other platform specific things. We can then add specific
accessors to extract useful infos (or dump as ASCII for some logging
facility) the details of the error cookie.
