The way nsproxy is structured, its all pointers to actual namespace (or
in case of rcfs patch) resource objects.  This lets namespaces objects be in a 
flat hierarchy while resource objects are in tree-like hierarchy.
nsproxy itself doesnt decide any hierarchy. Its those objects pointed to
by nsproxy which can form different hierarchies. In fact the rcfs
patches allows such a combination afaics.

A rcu_read_lock() should be required, which is not that expensive.
