I cloned your tree but it said one of the packs wasn't in the index. I
don't have the exact error message, sorry. I'll try again tomorrow.
Also your git tree (repository?) in kernel.org is a bit broken. The
git web interface gives me 403 error when I try to see a diff in your
zaurus.git tree, and there's stuff that appears to be missing (history
and commits).

Does this mean the battery won't get charged when using the 2.6
kernel, or that it won't get reported?
