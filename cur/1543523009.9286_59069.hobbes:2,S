Hi Alan,
	I'm attaching mail I exchanged with Jens Axboe... apparently, I forgot to
copy linux-scsi on my response.
	There are other appJens approaches, but Jen's should work Ok.
	Sorry, I don't have his patches.
Regards,
Robin

Hi All,
        I think it's pretty safe to assume SCSI disks will accept 10-byte Read/Write
CDB's.  In fact, I reviewed several O/S drivers recently, and both NT and SCO
only use 10 byte CDB's.
        I'm not surprised the 6-byte Write didn't work with your DVD-RAM, since 10-byte
CDB's are mandatory for Optical and DVD's, byte 6-byte CDB's are optional.
        Sure, reverting to a 6-byte request can be done on Illegal Request sense, but
unless you have some very old SCSI-1/CCS drives, I'm not sure you'll see a
problem.
Cheers,
Robin
