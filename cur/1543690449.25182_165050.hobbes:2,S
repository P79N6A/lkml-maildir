Sorry, my bad.  This is related to another bug: you unregistered the
kobject before checking the reference count.  This is bad, because the
remove can fail, and you don't re-register the kobject.  Even if we
re-register, now there's a spurious failure as the kobject vanishes
for a moment and reappears.  And let's not think about what happens if
trying to re-register the kobject fails 8(
So I think we really do want to unregister the kobject as part of the
cleanup, which makes things a little more complicated: my immediately
previous patch which should do what we want.  If it's still not clear,
then I'm obviously doing a really crappy job of explaining...
Thanks,
Rusty.
