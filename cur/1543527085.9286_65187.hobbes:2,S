Hi George,
All these things under discussion do not require major/minor numbers
because they are just regular files, e.g. /proc/cpuinfo or
/proc/driver/rtc. Although I agree with Richard that "devfs" is the best
name for devfs, it creates a tiny bit of misconception that it is only for
device nodes. But devfs_register() allows to create both regular files and
device nodes, look at its declaration and read the comments around it.
