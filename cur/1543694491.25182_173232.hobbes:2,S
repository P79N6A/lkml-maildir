We already have can_queue set in the host template, so this line is
superflous.

Does the driver work at all with QL_USE_IRQ undefined?  I don't think so
and if I'm right you should probably nuke the ifdef while you're at it.

should be
#ifdef PCMCIA
	scsi_host_put(shost);
#else
	scsi_unregister(shost):
#endif
if the reworked version of the previous patch is applied.

can_queue can't be 0 these days so this one could go away aswell.
