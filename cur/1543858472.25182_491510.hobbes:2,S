Ignoring the high bits is the wrong thing to be doing.
The BIOS placed the aperture in one place, and by masking bits, you're going
to be assuming its somewhere else, and scribbling over who knows what.

If the aperture is placed above 4G, we should deal with it. Currently, we
don't. (See the AGP patches Linus merged just before 2.6.19 was released
that work around this for intel-agp).
Just needs someone to find the time to write the code to do it, and test it.
