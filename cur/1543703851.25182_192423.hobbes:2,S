I plan to run everything provided by the suspended kernel actually. My idea
is to keep a handle to a page of the suspended kernel that contains that
code and just kick into it. Copying pages to their final location without
overriding the source pages is a bit of a funky job, but I had to do it
already with BootX so ... I'll work on that during one of the upcoming few
weeks hopefully, I'm a bit swamped with 3 different things at the moment.
