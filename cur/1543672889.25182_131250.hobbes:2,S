This is protected against unload by the reference counting done in 
open()/release(). ->ioctl() can be called only for open devices,
so you know the ioctl handler is not getting unloaded while it
is running.

The problem is that when the conversion handler is called, the reference
counting is only done for the module listed as ->owner in the
file operations. For example in the patch you submitted to add 
register_ioctl32_conversion() to drivers/serial/core.c I see nothing
stopping you from unloading core.ko while the handler is running
on a device owned by drivers/char/cyclades.c or any other serial driver.
It does not even have to be run on a serial driver, a user might try
to do ioctl(TIOCGSERIAL, ...) on a regular file...
