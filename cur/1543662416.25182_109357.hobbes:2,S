The analogy doesn't work.  Companies make money by selling the hardware,
having a free driver out there tends to just make them sell more hardware.
Furthermore, you bought one of their cards to reverse engineer the driver.
The situation here is that you have a product given to you for free.  Your
right to use that product is conditional on you not reverse engineering it.
If we were 3com and we had some nifty card and we were *giving* you cards
for free, it would be well within our rights to say "here are the rules,
if you don't like these rules then you have to pay for the card".
