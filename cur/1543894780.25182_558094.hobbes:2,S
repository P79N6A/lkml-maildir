And it doesn't *MATTER* what they intended, or what they feel the "spirit" of 
the license is. The second they made it public and gave people the option of 
applying the GPL to their projects their intent lost all meaning - because 
the intent of all the people that decided to release their projects under the 
GPL also has to be taken into account.
Note that I am not arguing, and have never argued, that the FSF overstepped 
its bounds when they wrote the GPLv3. Instead I am arguing that they are 
taking their own interpretation od the GPLv2, the intent of one *small* group 
of users of the GPLv2 and saying "this isn't something it was supposed to 
allow, so we have to make it clear in this new version". 
And even then they aren't being really consistent. The fact is that RMS has 
stated he believes it isn't ethical to charge for software. I see *nothing* 
in that belief that is in conflict with TiVO. What *IS* wrong with TiVO is 
that it makes it impossible for anyone to *easily* change the system - that 
the TiVO corporation could do something with ease that other people can't.

  ("the prospect of charging money for 
software [is] a crime against humanity")
http://www.faifzilla.org/ch01.html
 ("I already had an idea that software 
should be shared, but I wasn't sure how to think about that.")
PS: Note that Stallmans motivation was *SOURCE* *CODE* *ACCESS* - nothing 
else. His inability to get the source code to that printer was just the 
proverbial "straw that broke the camels back", *NOT* the prime motivation.
