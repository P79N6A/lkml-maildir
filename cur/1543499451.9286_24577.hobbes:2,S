	Hi all, i probed  2.3.3 kernel and  it started nice and everything was
going fine, i was with kde, netscape, ncftp and kmail i think running all when
suddenly i got Out of memory messages and all my process but login died, those
prosses are quit a few but i got 128M of memory and i don't think the memory
would just ran out with just that besides i got 56M swap space, and before with
64M of memory i didn't had trouble and even ran xemacs besides netscape and kde
(of course it got slower).....
	Later i  upgrade to 2.3.6 and  when it starts init and says freeing
unused kernel memory 36K  bla bla .... it freezes and the last messages is:
error in loading shared libraries: /lib/libNoVersion.so.1 and says cannot
allocate memory.....and cannot reboot i got to hard-reset the machine.....
	The  configuration:  128M memory  AMD K6-2  350Mhz  egcs-1.1.2 
compiled using -march=pentium optimisation option (no problems 'till now) and
kernel 2.3.6 compiled with the mtrr option for K6-2 memory  usage
	Any ideas why this ???
	BTW: why were removed the -mxxxx  options from the CONFIG_XXX[5-6]86 
options.....really they are not necessary for better performance (not even
-m486  :))
	Thanks !!!!!!!
