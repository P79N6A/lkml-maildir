Roman,
there was a state machine problem caused by something similar.
But the problem I described now happened with the current patch queue -
without the hrtimer_active() check. I have no direct access to the
machine which lets this surface and I just tried to reconstruct the
scenario from the sparse information which was provided by the customer.
All I can tell, that it is related to something similar and a requeue
happens where none should happen.
I agree, that it should not be handled in the hrtimer code. It has to be
fixed in the posix-timer code.
I make the check a BUG_ON(!hrtimer_active(timer) so it might show up in
-mm again. Ok ?
