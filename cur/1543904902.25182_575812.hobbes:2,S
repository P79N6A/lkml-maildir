Yes (to P-N ratio).
I'd really like to see netdev patches going to netdev (only :)
and SCSI patches to linux-scsi (only), e.g., unless they actually
address some linux-arch like issue(s).
However, those maintainers are quite different regarding patch
handling.  Maybe you could try to address some of that at that
Cambridge/September event.

Patch is withdrawn.
