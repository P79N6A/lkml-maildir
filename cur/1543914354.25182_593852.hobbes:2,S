Thank you for your report and forwarding your original message.
And I am glad that it is working for you.
It seems that '#if ... #endif' in an 'unlikly' macro argument is bad
coding. I don't know why my compiler and other users compiler didn't
produce an error.
Anyway, I'll fix such code.

I'll try in the future.
