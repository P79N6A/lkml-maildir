For various reasons I want a silent PC, so I'm using a notebook hard
drive in my desktop system.  I've recycled an ancient Foxconn Socket 754
mainboard in it with this IDE controller:
00:02.5 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5513 [IDE] (rev
01) (prog-if 80 [Master])
         Subsystem: Foxconn International, Inc. Unknown device 0c92
         Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 128
         I/O ports at 01f0 [size=8]
         I/O ports at 03f4 [size=1]
         I/O ports at 0170 [size=8]
         I/O ports at 0374 [size=1]
         I/O ports at 4000 [size=16]
On boot, the kernel reports:

Then later in the log, I see:

After that, no more DMA error messages (until the next system reboot).
I've tried this with a brand-new Seagate Momentus 5400.2 and a fairly 
new Western Digital WD800VE.  According to the disk specifications 
available on the vendor web sites, both drives are capable of UDMA/100 
speeds.
This error occurs whether the drive is on the primary IDE controller by
itself, or whether it's sharing the controller with an optical drive
(ata1.01 in the above listing).  I've changed the disk to the secondary
controller, I've swapped IDE cables, and changed out the 44-40
pin notebook drive adapter; no change.
The system is running 2.6.22.1-41.fc7 (x86-64, of course), but I've seen 
this on 2.6.21-based kernels as well.  I've noticed similar errors with 
a Dell Latitude D600 (x86, not SiS), also running recent Fedora 7 kernels.
Searching the web seems to indicate that either the drive or the
controller is bad, but since the error appears in so many different
hardware configurations, I'm beginning to think this is a problem with
libata, as that is an obvious common element.
This e-mail is mostly an experience report, but I'm also wondering if I
should be concerned about data on the drive, or have I missed the real
problem entirely?
Addendum: The internal SMART error log on the Seagate shows these errors 
repeatedly:
Error 103 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 296 hours (12 days + 8 hours)
   When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was
active or idle.
   After command completion occurred, registers were:
