Actually thinking some more about this issues I've come to conclusion,
that it is not required.
User can always crate two kevents - one for timer and one for rela data
processing and put crossed referencies into both, so when one of them is
ready user could remove another.

And thinking more about this issue, I can say that I'm again
variable-sized structures - they can not be placed into ring buffer (at
least into simple one), they do not allow allocation from cache, it is
impossible to get them correctly from userspace if there is now exact
knowledge about nature of that events and a lot of other problems.
If one strongly feels that it is required, it is possible to provide
userspace pointer in the ukevent structure, which then can be read in
->enqueue callback by kernelside (there is similar trick in network
AIO).
