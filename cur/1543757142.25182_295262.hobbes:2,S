I took your advice and built your kernel with a few modifications (XFS instead 
of ext, etc.). If I boot the kernel with init=/bin/sh, I can actually 
suspend! Thanks!
I will exhaustively enable and disable drivers tomorrow to figure out which 
one is causing suspend to fail when I do a complete boot. Whatever we find is 
clearly a bug that should be fixed.
It is not the framebuffer driver (I always ran without vesafb or radeonfb), 
and it is not my ipw2200 or USB drivers.
Also, is USB suspend/resume supposed to work? My brief trials involved 
modprobing the USB HCD modules, which still allowed me to suspend/resume, but 
my USB mouse was non-functional on resume.
