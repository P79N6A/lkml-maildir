I am feeling wimpy.  There've been a few too many raid5 breakages
recently and it is very hard to really judge the performance impact of
this change.  I even have a small uncertainty of correctness - could
it still hang in some other way?  I don't think so, but this is
complex code...
If it were really common I would have expected more noise on the
mailing list.  Sure, there has been some, but not much.  However maybe
people are searching the archives and finding the "increase stripe
cache size" trick, and not reporting anything .... seems unlikely
though.
How about we queue it for 2.6.25-rc1 and then about when -rc2 comes
out, we queue it for 2.6.24.y?  Any one (or any distro) that really
needs it can of course grab the patch them selves...
