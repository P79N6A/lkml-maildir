I don't think Linux _depends_ on GNU software.  From my point of view
Linux is just the kernel.
If I put together a striped down computer with only the
essentials (motherboard, 3c509, vga) put a linux kernel,
DHCP client, and netscape (or my own browser) on a PCMCIA 
memory card and hooked it up to a TV I could call it Linux 
WebTV.  I don't think GNU/Linux WebTV would be accurate.
