The current sg driver should use alloc_pages() with an order that should
get 32 KB. If the order being passed to alloc_pages() in sg.c is only
getting one page by default that is bug.
The generic routines now being used can turn that 32KB segment into
multiple 4KB ones if the LLD does not support clustering.

Actually, we will hit the SCSI_MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS first. It is 128 by
default so (4 * 128) KB. Here is a patch, only compile tested, to
increase SCSI_MAX_PHYS_SEGMENTS to 256.
