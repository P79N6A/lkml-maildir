Hi,
I am trying to use O_DIRECT to read ordinary files and read syscall
always returns 0, unless when the file size equals the fs block size. Is
it true that I can only use O_DIRECT when the size of the file written
in the inode is a multiple of block size?
Thanks and excuse me for the newbie question,
Bruno.
