On the nightly IA32 compiles, I am now flagging NEW warnings that were
introduced into the build in the last 24 hours.  I'll send these out
automatically for awhile with the builds as it has some value at this
stage.
drivers/net/wan/cosa.c:516: warning: implicit declaration of function `sti'
drivers/net/wan/cosa.c:661: warning: `MOD_INC_USE_COUNT' is deprecated
(declared at include/linux/module.h:482)
drivers/net/wan/cosa.c:669: warning: `MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT' is deprecated
(declared at include/linux/module.h:494)
