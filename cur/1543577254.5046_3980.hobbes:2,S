hello,
Would XML be considered human readable enough for /proc files?  If not,
how about a /xproc filesystem ( maybe as a kernel build option ), same
as /proc but uses an xml grammer for reporting.
I can see tons of uses for this, no more 'fuzzy' parsing for gui
configuration tools, resource monitors, etc.
?
just thinking aloud really,
