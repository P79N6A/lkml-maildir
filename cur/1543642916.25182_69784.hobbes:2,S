What reasons? Adapter upgrades/replacement on a live system? I can imagine
someone using different HBAs so that they won't hit the same bug in both
HBAs, but that is a weak argument; I would think such systems would want
some type of cluster failover.
If the HBAs had the same memory and other limitations, it should function
OK, but it is hard to figure out exactly what might happen (if the HBAs had
different error handling characteristics, handled timeouts differently,
etc.). It would be easy to get rid of the checking for the same drivers,
(the code actually checks for the same drivers via Scsi_Host::hostt, not
the same hardware) - so it would allow multiple paths if the same driver
is used for different HBA's.

I haven't tried it, but I see no reason why it would not work.

Note that scsi uses the block device layer (the request_queue_t) for
character devices - look at st.c, sg.c, and sr*.c, calls to scsi_do_req()
or scsi_wait_req() queue to the request_queue_t. Weird but it works - you can
open a CD via sr and sg at the same time.

The scsi multi-path code is not in 2.5.x, and I doubt it will be accepted
without the support of James and others.
