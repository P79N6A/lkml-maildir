I administrate machines remotely, and  sometimes, they run out of processes,
or other  nice things like  that, and I'm looking  for the sysreq  patch, or
something like that, so that I  can kill processes and/or reboot the machine
through the serial port (configured at serial console).
I saw a  patch a while ago  that would do what  I need I think,  but I can't
find it anymore, and I don't know if it'd still work on 2.2.x kernels...
(yes, I also know about softdog, the software watchdog, but in some cases, I
find  that it  triggers  either a  bit  easily and  reboots  my machine  for
nothing, or  sometimes, I'd like to  assess the situation myself  and decide
what to do (in some cases I have shells opened on the machine and it lets me
fix the problem without rebooting))
Thanks for any pointers,
Marc
