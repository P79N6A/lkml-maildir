For more info on usb colorimeter problems you can check

It seems Graeme Gill, the Argyll CMS author has hit several linux usb
problems over the years but has not coordinated well with the Linux usb
maintainers. We're finding all the ugly bits now that we're trying to
meger ﻿Argyll CMS in various distributions (Fedora, Mandriva, Ubuntu,
etc)
It's a bit difficult to follow this thread because the argyllcms list is
killing CCs and not everyone is putting them back in.
