Off Topic:
	Discourse on Christoph's "Rewriting something from scratch
		is horrible engineering practice"
Christoph,
Imagine a for ( ) { } loop spanning 5000 lines.  Imagine never using
functions to separate things.  But imagine that a _factory_ is using
this code on its production line and that code, although badly written,
does work and keeps the production line going and thousands of
people working.
They hire an engineer to make it _managable_ and supportable -- this
warrants understanding the production line, what the code does, what it
controls and how.  Understanding how the factory workers use it and what
they expect.  Understanding the code (which may not be as easy).  Then it
is rewritten so that it can be easily supported and maintained.
This is real life example.
	Luben
