As above, 2.2.0pre1-ac3 works like a charm for me.
PII 233x2, SuperMicro P6DBE mobo, 192MB RAM
2 x WD 6.4GIG
NE2k PCI
Lots of modules
Tape drive off a BT 946
CDROM writer off ^^^^^^ (dont know about writing though)
CD off IDE
My spurious "Interrupt lost while masked ..." don't occur.
Not too shabby ...
G'day!
