Ever looked at plan9? It's supposed to be what Unix was meant to be,
by the original Unix designers. They threw most of the magic constants
overboard and in fact _use strings_ everywhere (for devices, ioctls,
and signals!). They also greatly extended the "everything is a file"
paradigm, and procfs, devfs, shmfs, etc are an integral part of the OS.
There people designed Unix. I assume they are pretty smart.
Mike.
