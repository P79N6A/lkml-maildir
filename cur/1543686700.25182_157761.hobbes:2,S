   just in case anybody's searching the archives:
   I got the following advice from Jeff Garzik and it worked (didn't do 
much testing yet, but at least the whole disk is usable):
   2.4.21-ac4 (vanilla plus ac4 patches)
   create another vanilla tree with libata5 patches, then copy the 
following files to ac4 tree: drivers/scsi/{ata_piix,libata}.c and 
include/linux/ata.h
   build with scsi ata support (make sure you have bios set so that sata 
drives are seen as sata drives, not legacy ide drives, I only got 
machines lockups in legacy mode). The disks should be visible as scis 
disk (/dev/sd[a-z]).
   libata5 patch:
