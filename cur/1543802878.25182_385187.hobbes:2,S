So you are saying that silentoldconfig outputs no less information than
oldconfig? No output compared to a full config output (yes, with some
special cased invisible options, but the same output that a user would
see if manually configuring).
My point is that you are making oldconfig and silentoldconfig operate
differently when they encounter a closed stdin. You are making them
inconsistent. And so far, you have yet to give a valid reason to do so.
I've been giving very valid reasons why they should work the same, and
why the behavior is correct for them to work that way.
What is the reason for silentoldconfig to fail in this way, and for
oldconfig not to? I suspect you have some special usage of your own for
which you depend on this functionality.
