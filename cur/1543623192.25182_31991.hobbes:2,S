First of all, my congratulations for the implementation of i/o scheduling.
It was long overdue.
One suggestion: why not use the process* for scheduling, so that processes
that do a lot of i/o are penalized? A field in the process struct could
contain i/o priority for this purpose. Shouldn't i/o be scheduled exactly in
the same way as the CPU, since it is a shared resource?
