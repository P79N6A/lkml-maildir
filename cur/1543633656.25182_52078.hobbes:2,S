"Windows" as in...?  AFAICS Windows _kernel_ sees .lnk and sees a plain old
file.  Some part of godforsaken mess known as GNOME asks kernel to read
from plain old file and interprets the contents returned by read().  Some
part of godforsaken mess known as Windows userland asks kernel to read from
plain old file and interprets the contents returned by read().  In either
case interpretation is done in userland.
I don't see any reason to put that stuff into the kernel - no more than
putting ~-expansion or globbing in there.
