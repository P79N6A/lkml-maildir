It did no such thing. It just moved the file.
Use
	git show -M -B 156ca2bbf6503a02d7d6829886ce381d572de66e
to see how <asm/swab.h> is just the old <asm/byteorder.h> renamed, and 
with some stuff moved around. Eg it contains:
	-#define __BIG_ENDIAN
	-#include <linux/byteorder.h>
because now the <asm/byteorder.h> header file on powerpc will just do
	+#include <asm/swab.h>
	+#include <linux/byteorder/big_endian.h>
instead of doing that __BIG_ENDIAN define and conditionals that didn't 
work with user space.
So it really should be a no-op. And no, I'm not reverting it, because 
I guarantee that reverting it won't result in a working build - the broken 
<linux/byteorder.h> file no longer exists (and will not be re-instated).
So I'd suggest testing it, and if it really doesn't work, trying to figure 
out why. Because a revert won't be helping.
