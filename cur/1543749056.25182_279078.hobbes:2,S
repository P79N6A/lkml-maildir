60ms is certainly _way_ too small for most UDP traffic.  With something 
like
that, OpenAFS would die almost immediately.  I think the current OpenAFS
minimum is like 20 minutes, although somebody patched the OpenAFS
source to send a keepalive every 5 minutes, so it could be reduced.  
OTOH,
sending a keepalive every 60ms would take a _massive_ amount of
bandwidth even for one client, think about a couple hundred :-D.  Heck, 
I've
even seen pings on a regular basis that take longer than 60ms, which
means that even an infinitely fast kerberos server wouldn't respond 
quickly
enough :-D.
