Subject: [PATCH] [TRIVIAL] 2.5.40 Makefile: a small improvement
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch adds the -fno-ident for CFLAGS.  This flag saves some space
in object files.  It worth nothing for the compressed kernel (even
though vmlinux becomes smth. near 15K less), but it worth somethig for
the modules - each of them becomes for some tens of bytes less.  May
be this can be considered as healthy...
