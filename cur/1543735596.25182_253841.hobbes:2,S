Andries, /etc/mtab is obsolete since the day when /proc/self/mounts was
introduced. So, kill it today from your mount binary! TODAY. ...
Then discuss what is still missing from /proc/self/mounts:
- the 'user' option for umount must be handled in some way
- loop mounts do not map to the real filename, users cant open the
  device node to run losetup on it. I think it will also get relative
  path names.
- fix all broken apps that still rely on mtab. like GNU df(1)
