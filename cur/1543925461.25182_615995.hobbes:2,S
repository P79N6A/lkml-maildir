Most likely.

I would compare the e820 maps between single and dual core. Perhaps the
initrd happens to be loaded somewhere where it overwrite other memory.
Another reason could be broken MTRRs not covering all memory correctly.
This can cause strange mmeory corruptions
Also if single core is an old stepping memory remapping might work
differently.
