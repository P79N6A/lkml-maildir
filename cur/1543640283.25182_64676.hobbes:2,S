This is already done for the IDT descriptor, but not (yet) for the gdt 
descriptor(s).
Alignment checks are only done when CPL==3. And lidt/lgdt are (obviously) 
privileged, although sidt/sgdt (and sldt/str for that matter) are not,
but I can't see how application could take benefit or make malicious use
of this capability.
