Thanks for your reply,
Does that mean just enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB  in  kernel  config  or
more?
I see:
#define SLAB_POISON             0x00000800UL    /* Poison objects */
in slab.h, but there's nothing settable in there.
Anyway I've recompiled the 2.4.19 kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y.
Let's see what happens.
Greets,
