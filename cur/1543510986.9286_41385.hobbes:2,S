Is it really? We sure as hell can do a lot that Windows can do, and quite
a few of these things (like stability, speed etc.) is because we don't tie
down ourselves with binary compability.

Well, for one thing, we'd have to drop all UP-kernels and run all kernels
SMP, to avoid the problem of having separate modules for SMP & UP.
