Well there is this in sas_discover.h:
struct scsi_core_mapping {
	int  channel;
	int  id;
};
struct LU {
[...]
	struct scsi_core_mapping map;
so if you use channel, id and scsilun_to_int() (or your SCSI_LUN
reimplementation of that) on your LUN structure, you have everything
necessary to interface to scsi_scan_target, yes.
You have to have this, otherwise you wouldn't be able to use
scsi_add_device in sas_scsi_host.c:sas_register_with_scsi().
Based on this it does look like your refusal to use scsi_scan_target is
based on ideological rather than technical objections.
It also looks like you have a bug in your id mapping code: you allocate
one id per lun, not per target, so you're going to run out pretty
quickly when you meet a device with actual logical units, since you hard
code max_ids to 128 in sas_port.c
