By "interactivity" I mean "things which make it feel jerky".
The commonly occurring things, not the oddball corner cases.
- huge reads from /dev/mem
- exit with 1,000 files open
- exit with half a million pages to be zapped
And "fixing" copy_*_user is outright dumb.  Just fix the four
or five places where it matters.
