Sure. I've just tested -mm2; sorry it took so long but I had a couple of
other things going on.
Sadly, it locks up hard (no sysrq or anything) after booting, right in the
login prompt. Sometimes I got as far as typing the username and pressing
enter, others just frozen without even being able to press a key.
So I removed the SMT scheduler because I thought it might be related, and
it didn't even got to boot at all, it seem to freeze somewhere after
the initial load, but I can't see anything because the screen goes black
(even after I disabled framebuffer, SMP and preempt just in case).
I'll see if I can get a working config tomorrow morning so I can get to do
this tests (and report that lockup too).
Thanks a lot,
		Alberto
