Ralink cards don't require any binary firmware. I got one of the Hawking
Tech pcmcia cards off the shelf at a local CompUSA store and the card 
was a good $20 cheaper than a Linksys card. So far I haven't had any
problems with the card or the driver.
A list of Ralink hardware and drivers can be found at
