Is there anyone working on a debugger that is internal to the kernel for use 
during a catastrophic failure, allowing for causing a panic(for testing) and 
reading the registers during operation.  It seems like a good idea which has 
been employed by the FreeBSD folk, and presumably the rest of that 
crowd.  If anyone is working on it, I would like to help.
