Yes, the fix I posted was not complete. I submitted a corrected one 
already.

That's intentional. If you don't want to build modules, use "make 
KBUILD_MODULES= bzImage". Or you can just ignore errors using "make -k".

The fact that it aborts is intentional. That it doesn't build the .h in 
that case is a bug. Which driver is it?

Well, I can fix that, I'll look into it.
