Right. My machine has an ISA bus too, but no support for it yet :)

Yes, I do this for the DCA ports (which are on the DIO bus).
However, that doesn't seem to be appropriate for the APCI devices which
are on the motherboard. So I'll use the platform driver for those. Do
you have any suggestion for the id value I should use in my platform
device? I looked in the existing drivers and ids -1 and 1-5 are taken,
any reason id 0 was not used?
Kind regards,
Kars.
