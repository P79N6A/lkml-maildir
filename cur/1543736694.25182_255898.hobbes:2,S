Ouch. I suspected something bad will happen.

No, we really need to keep backwards compatibility with the numbering
here and solve the packetsize issue elsewhere. Probably the best would
be for each of the protocols to have its own packet collection routine,
like the Synaptics and ALPS already have. It could be shared among the
simpler protocols.
We'll need this anyway for a heuristic resynchronizer.

I really would prefer if old installations of the X driver would work
with new kernel without the need to upgrade the X driver. I propose to
keep the protocol numbers intact, and if possible to also find a better
way for the X driver to detect a touchpad than relying on the IDs of the
input device, namely based on BTN_TOOL_FINGER presence.
