Christoph -
We discussed this earlier this week. Here is part of the mail:

I currently unlink the mmu_notifier when the last GRU mapping is closed. For
example, if a user does a:
        gru_create_context();
        ...
        gru_destroy_context();
the mmu_notifier is unlinked and all task tables allocated
by the driver are freed. Are you suggesting that I leave tables
allocated until the task terminates??
Why is that better? What problem do I cause by trying
to free tables as soon as they are not needed?

I assumed that I would need to use call_rcu() or synchronize_rcu()
before the table is actually freed. That's still on my TODO list.
