64bit dev_t's are going to cause some real problems. I would suggest you
try passing a 64bit dev_t over NFS - especially to non unix clients before
you do this. 
If you go to a 64bit dev_t you will have to do hackish horrors for NFS support
even Linux to Linux. Stay with a 32bit dev_t, supporting more device files
than we can create 1 a second within our epoch is crazy
