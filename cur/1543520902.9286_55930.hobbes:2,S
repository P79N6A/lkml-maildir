My main point was that 38 years is a LONG TIME in the computer industry.
Are you still using Wordperfect 5.1 on a 386 DOS machine at 40 MHz? It
requires much less energy than the Windows boxen running at 200+MHz and
it has the added feature that secretaries really liked it and the Windows
version of the same product sucked (from what I understand). That was 10
years ago...
Sure, you could run your web server/widget on an ancient 32 bit machine
in 2038, but you won't be able to get support for that machine and it
will seem all but useless.
I'm sorry, but the computer industry just doesn't seem to be concerned
with what does the job. They are interested in fast, sexy hardware and
cool apps with lots of eye candy. Not that that's bad or anything.
