Alan:
I was applying the ldisc changes
to the synclink drivers and had a question
regarding the tty_wakeup() helper.
>From what I see, all drivers who call tty_wakeup()
also do wake_up_interruptible(&tty->write_wait);
at the same time.
Would it be reasonable to add that to the
helper and remove it from the individual drivers.
In my first pass on the synclink drivers (before
I saw the new tty_wakeup helper), I created
a write_wakeup wrapper that does the same thing
as tty_wakeup but also moved
wake_up_interruptible(&tty->write_wait);
into the wrapper. This works for me.
