The reasons why I for one do not plan to use git are:
- disk space
- bandwidth (rsync traffic has to go through our masquerader, and the 
             amount of traffic through the masquerader I'm allowed to 
             generate is limited)
- I do not need Linus' tree for anything.
  I'm working against -mm because it's further in development.
Having said this, Andrew might perhaps be able to _additionally_ provide 
-mm patches without linus.patch for the convenience of git users.
