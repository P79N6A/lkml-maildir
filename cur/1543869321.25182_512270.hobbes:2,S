it just triggered on one of my boxes:
BUG: at kernel/sched.c:4692 cond_resched_softirq()
 [<c03ce128>] cond_resched_softirq+0x5f/0x7b
 [<c0369078>] release_sock+0x42/0x81
 [<c03693bc>] sk_wait_data+0x57/0x9d
 [<c0129a00>] autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0x33
 [<c03942ff>] tcp_recvmsg+0x39c/0x973
 [<c0368e39>] sock_common_recvmsg+0x3e/0x54
 [<c0367903>] sock_aio_read+0x106/0x112
 [<c0159b0c>] do_sync_read+0xc8/0x105
 [<c0129a00>] autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0x33
 [<c0159e82>] vfs_read+0xc1/0x15a
 [<c015a7d2>] sys_read+0x41/0x67
 [<c0103c10>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
 =======================
so tcp_recvmsg() definitely gets into this condition.
