Not exactly.  Ones who were knowleadgeable enough to create shared
read-write /usr/local will know what to do (mkdir -p WILL NOT overwrite
files, WILL NOT change permissions, etc - and it created directory it can
be as easily removed) with it, ones who have simple configuration (and 
it's MAJORITY) will not have headache (unlike manual symlink creation
after each upgrade choice).
"Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible". You
proposal makes maintaining of simple systems significally harder while
giving only VERY marginal win for complex ones.
