I have RedHat Linx 6.0 (Linux 2.2.5).  When I use "insmod" load my Fibre
Channel HBA driver, it shows:
scsi :  1 host.
Vendor: SEAGATE   ModelL ST39102FC      Rev: 0006
Type:   Direct-Access
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes.  Sectors= 17783240 [8683 MB] [8.7
GB]
sda: unknown partition table
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes.  Sectors= 17783240 [8683 MB] [8.7
GB]
sdb: unknown partition table
SCSI device sdc: hdwr sector= 512 bytes.  Sectors= 17783240 [8683 MB] [8.7
GB]
sdc: unknown partition table
The it stops and back to system prompt.
What is the next?  
Is the driver module loading process completed?
- If so, what is the next thing I do to find the device, 
  partition it and mount the device for some IO test? 
- If not, what could be the problem for stopping te laoding process?
Many thanks!
