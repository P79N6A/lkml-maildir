true, there is only one glibc, but there is not just one c library (uclib,
etc) and while there is only one http protocol there is not just a single
webserver api (netscape, IIS, apache 1.3, apache 2.0 all have different
api's)
there do need to be common points, in the case of GUI's on *nix X is the
common point, the toolkits used to write programs don't need to all have
the exact same api.
