How repeatable is this?  Is the server SMP?
There does seem to be a possible problem with sk_inuse not being
updated atomically, so a race between an increment and a decrement
could lose one of them.
svc_sock_release seems to often be called with no more protection than
the BKL, and it decrements sk_inuse.
svc_sock_enqueue, on the other hand increments sk_inuse, and is
protected by sv_lock, but not, I think, by the BKL, as it is called by
a networking layer callback.  So there might be a possibility for a
race here.
The attached patch might fix it, so if you are having reproducable
problems, it might be worth applying this patch.
Trond: any comments?
