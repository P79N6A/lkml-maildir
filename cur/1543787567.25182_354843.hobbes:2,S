Side note: it has nothing to do with bit-fields: it happens for any 
structure member that sparse will have incorrectly figured out as having a 
value pre-assigned to it. So even
	struct {
		int value;
	} dummy = { 0 };
	dummy.value = 1;
will generate the warning. It isn't that a bitfield cannot have it's 
address taken, it's that sparse has incorrectly "optimized" dummy.value to 
be 0, so it ends up evaluating it as
	0 = 1;
and says that it's trying to assign a non-lvalue.. Very stupid.
