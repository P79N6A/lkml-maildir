Hi everybody
I still have sound problems:
When I play wave files I get dropouts with my
Creative Soundblaster 128 PCI
exactly in the same way as with the SB 16 Vibra I used before. The
Creative Soundblaster 128 PCI is equivalent to the Ensoniq AudioPCI.
The dropouts happen as before also with light load.
With more load it is easy to reproduce. For example with:
penguin> play some_music.wav &
penguin> find / -name "*core*"
Xosview shows the interrupt lights for the timer, sound and
scsi controller on both cpus all the time. 
During the dropouts both interrupt lights for the sound get dark but the
lights for the timer and the scsi controller stay on. Also the mouse seems
to respond quick. And you can also see the mouse interrupt lights
sometimes. The cpus do almost nothing during this test.
Here is some information about my interrupts:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      13015      12926    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:        183        167    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:      11129      11134   IO-APIC-level  es1370
 10:          0          0   IO-APIC-level  eth0
 11:      10478      10479   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx, aic7xxx
 12:       1676       1688    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:       1050        180    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
The pci information about my soundcard is:
  Bus  0, device   9, function  0:
    Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq AudioPCI (rev 1).
      Slow devsel.  IRQ 5.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=12.Max
Lat=128.
      I/O at 0xd400 [0xd401].
Does something turn only the soundcard interupts off for some time.
All other things work good during the dropouts. The system is also
responsive.
