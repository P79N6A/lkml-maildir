This is what I did to try and get a T23 to work (which isn't
a T20, I know).
First upgrade your BIOS and/or system controller - available
FOC from the IBM web site.
If that doesn't fix it, try changing whether or not interrupts
are allowed during suspend. I think for a T20 they should *not*
be, but the T23 crashes if they are *not* (and needs it the
other way around). Don't just fiddle with the config option as
pci_quirks will override it. Either look at doing something like
  
http://www.alex.org.uk/T23/T23-apm-patch.txt
or just frig the code yourself to force apm.allow_ints one way
or another.
