"inline" in the kernel is (for recent gcc's) mapped to 
__attribute__((always_inline)), and therefore the
"static inline struct msdos_sb_info *MSDOS_SB" does exactly the opposite 
of what you want.
You'd have to move this into a .c file to remove the "inline".
But considering that the whole function is
static inline struct msdos_sb_info *MSDOS_SB(struct super_block *sb)
{
        return sb->s_fs_info;
}
I'm quite surprised that there's any problem with it.
