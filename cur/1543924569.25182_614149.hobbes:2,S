Ah, that is not what I meant. My question was, why a semaphore, not a
mutex? Semaphores should not be used if at all possible - for one you
don't get lockdep checking your code.
/me converts the stuff over, and boots
Ah, that probably is the reason. This device tree is hard to annotate.
I'll try and think of something..
