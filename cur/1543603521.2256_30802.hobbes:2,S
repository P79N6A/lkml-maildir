Hi,
I found a problem with fat when I tried to mount a fat filesystem created
with 'mkdosfs -F 32 -S 8192'. I tried mounting it as vfat and I got a
panic() from set_blocksize() in fs/buffer.c
fs/fat/inode.c sets an error veriable if it detects an error but it
doesn't bail out immediately, instead it tries to pass this sectorsize to
set_blocksize() which checks if it's bigger than PAGE_SIZE and then
panics.
The solution is to bail out before set_blocksize() is called.
I checked with Al Viro on irc and he agreed.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
