Wrong.  One word: PIO.  We _still_ to this day have no guarantee by
block device drivers that the data they've read into the page cache
will be flushed into RAM rather than sitting in the CPU cache.

Depends if you think about that patch I guess.  If you're an embedded

very attractive, even if it is distasteful to us.
