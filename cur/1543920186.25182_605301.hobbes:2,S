How about this in the Device Mapper raid-1/mirror code?
	/* FIXME: add read balancing */
That comment has been in there for many releases.  I've wanted read
balancing for several servers and had all sorts of ideas about it, like
adding functions to the underlying device queues to return a "queuing
cost" to determine which is the best queue to add the read request.  I
think that could work better for queues like CFQ than the MD
closest-head.
An implementation would also need to be benchmarked against the MD
raid-1.
Along with the time to submit it to LKML, get it reviewed and polish it
up, it might make a good student project.
