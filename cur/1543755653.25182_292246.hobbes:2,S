The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is a license statement to binary module developers
that they are not allowed to use the code in question (by the author).
Changing those is logically similar to changing the license header in
a GPL licensed file from "Licensed under the GNU GPL v2 only" to
"Licensed under the BSD license found here: 
http://somewhere/".
  It
just plain isn't legal to change those without the agreement of all
contributors.

You could legally change it as long as you document that the symbol
"EXPORT_SYMBOL_BSD_HOOK_FOR_PORTING_DRIVERS_TO_THE_LINUX_KERNEL"
really means that it's licensed under the GPL despite the confusing
name, although even then you are at risk of the author calling foul.
It also doesn't change the licensing restrictions on the symbols.

One other thing, it technically _isn't_ legal to link any kind of
binary module with the Linux kernel.  The GPL actually indicates
that "linking" *DOES* make a derivative work.  However, Linus and
basically all of the contributors have agreed that the current
"EXPORT_SYMBOL" functions are ok for use by non-GPL modules, but
they refuse to have hooks specifically there for closed-source
modules, and usually require that most new innovative interfaces
are "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL"ed instead.

The one major stumbling block is that any code that imports symbols
that are exported via "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL" can only legally _export_
symbols using the same, for the reason I stated above.

If it's a non-GPL module it _cannot_ legally use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPLed
symbols, either directly or indirectly, under any circumstances.
