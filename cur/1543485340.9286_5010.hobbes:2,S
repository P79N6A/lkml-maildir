	Yes and No.    kmem_cache_create()  FAILS if the named cache
	exists.  However there is no   kmem_cache_delete()  which would
	used to remove some module related cache...  (IP*/TCP comes
	to my mind as an example needing it.)
	I have tried to resort to such esoteric tricks as having separate
	permanently loaded submodule that just allocates the damn cache..
	Please add that  kmem_cache_delete()  routine, and the world
	will be better place to be.
