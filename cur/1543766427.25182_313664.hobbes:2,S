Hmm, what do you mean by "repeating what gets signed"?

Two ways:
1. An index of sigs to signed-object.
(or more generally: objects to referring-objects)
2. Just give people the URI of the signature, let them (or their
    tools) follow the 'parent' link to the object of interest

You could hack it in to the namespace somehow I guess. I'm not sure 
hacking it in would be a good thing though.
I think it might be more useful just to provide a general index to 
lookup 'referring' objects (if git does not already - I dont think it 
does, but I dont know enough to know for sure). So you could ask 
"which {commit,tag,signature,tree}(s) refer(s) to this object?" - 
that general concept will always work. If you wanted to make the 
implementation of this index use some kind of sub directory as in the 
above, fine..
See also method 2 above. Which would be more efficient for tools if, 
within a project, some developers sign their 'updates' and some 
dont.. (you never need to check whether there's a signature or not - 
you'll know it from the URI automatically).

Indeed.
Anyway, we shall see what Linus does. :)
(But I do hope at least that signatures are /not/ included inline 
using BEGIN PGP.. in the object that is signed.)
