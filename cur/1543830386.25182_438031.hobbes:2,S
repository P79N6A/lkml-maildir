Subject: When will the Areca RAID driver be merged into mainline?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/27/437

Anyone have an ETA on this? I heard soon but was wondering how soon..?
kernel-version-2.6.x
kernel-version-2.6.x/arcmsr
kernel-version-2.6.x/arcmsr/arcmsr.c
kernel-version-2.6.x/arcmsr/arcmsr.h
kernel-version-2.6.x/arcmsr/Makefile
kernel-version-2.6.x/readme.txt
The driver is quite small and non-intrusive, I was wondering what is 
holding it back getting merged into the official mainline kernel?
Thanks,
Justin.
