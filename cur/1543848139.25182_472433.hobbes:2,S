Here is output with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled followed by another crash before CONFIG_DEBUG_VM was enabled.

Hmm, this is a new one. The page is free and not reserved, wheras we are
used to seeing them reserved here.

These unused swap offset entry messages seem to indicate extensive memory
corruption in your page tables. Probably bad RAM, or system overheating
when you load it up :(
Can you run a good memory tester like memtest86+ overnight?
