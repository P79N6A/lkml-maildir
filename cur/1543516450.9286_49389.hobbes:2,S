Careful! An idea that "just sounds cool" might be a nightmare to implement,
or keep up to date, or introduce way too much bloat and be thrown out
because of that. BTW, as I stated, much of what this acomplishes can be got
via a symlink farm. Why is that not enough here?

Please, lay out your full requirements, then talk about limitations of
first prototypes. The point of how to handle a multiple mount and
modifications (deleting, adding files; modifiying files; chmod/chown-ing
them, touch-ing them, ...) is too important to leave for "later, full
implementation": If no decent semantics can be defined, the whole idea is
moot IMVHO.

Without a clear goal to point at, I'm afraid this will just degenerate into
an unholy mess.

Agree.

It also handles the who overrides whom, and keeps some persistence. Not
indispensable, but probably nice to have (if not, the "overlay" will have
to be rebuilt each time. Urgh!)

Sounds reasonable.
