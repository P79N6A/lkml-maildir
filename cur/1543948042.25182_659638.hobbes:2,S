I agree, this does not make any sense until you get to very large SMP
systems - and only iff it can be demonstrated, that the overhead
associated with lock statistics and including some notion of the context
switch overhead still comes out with a net gain.
There is some notion of task-routing in the RT scheduler already, and
this is quite a clever little algorithm. 
I see no reason, why the scheduler should not eventually take directly
into account (when balancing), the quantifiable context-switch and CPU
overhead of moving a task to a distant processor.
In fact, for a deadline-based scheduler working on high-frequency tasks,
given that the times can switch so radically, this is would be
requiredOnve context-switch-overhead data is available to the scheduler,
there is no particular reason why adaptive locking could not also
utilize that data.
