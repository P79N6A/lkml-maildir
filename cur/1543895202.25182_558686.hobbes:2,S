With current state of affairs it's not only hard for developers, but
and for users: <20070221220520.GA20659@artselect.com>,
              <20070429230037.95120@gmx.net>
I'm trying to re-do some kbuild stuff, but i'm getting rather offensive
answers :( <1182020654.8176.398.camel@chaos>
(Even if i'm academic with free Internet, i doubt i even tried to
think to improve something, if i didn't have one, because i wouldn't knew
huge lkml traffic, problems, etc.)
Maybe i'm wrong. But reducing amount of traffic/files and ease of
(re-)configuration are not last things to be done for better testing.
All for speed of getting and compiling kernel. Latter for avoiding
bugs and noise due to inconsistent build configuration.
Finally again, bug-reporting and tracking tools, i've tried to discuss
are major problems out there I think it's plain easy and deal with. One
more example:
