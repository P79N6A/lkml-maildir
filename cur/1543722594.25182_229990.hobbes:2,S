I don't get it.  If you were going to add a new zone, identified by
__GFP_WHATEVER then you'd need to increase MAX_NR_ZONES
anyway, wouldn't you?
I'm sure you're right, but I haven't worked on this stuff in months and
it's obscure.  Care to explain a little more?

The "ZONEMODS" identifier doesn't really grab me.  ZONETYPES, or something?
Either way, please add a big fat comment over it, explaining to the poor reader
what its semantic meaning is.
