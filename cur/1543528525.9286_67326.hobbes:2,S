Think if you have 10mbyte free. Two mallocs 9mbyte large will succeed
immediatly, but you won't have enough memory to allocate 18mbyte of ram
when you'll fault in the pages later.
overcommit is good because it avoids big mistakes, but we really don't try
to be strict in such area and that's not a so bad thing IMHO.
