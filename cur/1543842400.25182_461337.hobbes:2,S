Hmm... the reason I asked is that the UBC infrastructure doesn't provide
guarantee support and Kirill mentioned there is no changes required to
UBC if you have to move your CPU controller to be under UBC.

What I meant is that to leave them charged, and if when they are
ummapped and mapped later, charge it to the appropriate BC.
