Mhh no dropped packets. I tried to reproduce the problem by changing
netconsole to always use the dev_queue_xmit path, but works flawlessly
for me. Please try to find out if the packets are lost before or after
the qdisc by looking at the packet counter.
BTW: You still haven't sent me the packet dump (from the originating
machine).
