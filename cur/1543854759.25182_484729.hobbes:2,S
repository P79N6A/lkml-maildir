It might make sense to just use another GFP_HIGHxyzzy #define for the 
non-movable HIGHMEM users. There's probably much fewer of those, and their 
behaviour obviously is very different from the traditional GFP_HIGHUSER 
pages (ie page cache and anonymous user mappings).
So you could literally use "GFP_HIGHPTE" for the PTE mappings, and that 
would in fact even simplify some of the users (ie it would allow moving 
the #ifdef CONFIG_HIGHPTE check from the code to <linux/gfp.h>). Similarly 
for any other non-movable things, no?
So then we'd just make GFP_HIGHUSER implicitly mean "movable". It could be 
nice if GFP_USER would do the same, but I guess we have too many of those 
around to verify (although _most_ of those are probably kmalloc, and 
kmalloc would obviously better strip away the __GFP_MOVABLE bit anyway).
