I see two reasons:
1 - early_boot, or anything that looks like this, does not exist
currently (and the following reason might show why).
2 - If we use this, we cannot declare the early code with __init, so it
will have to stay there forever insteaf of being removable once boot is
over.
Therefore, I think it's better to stick to an immediate_set_early
version.

Yup, excellent idea. I just changed the linux kernel markers too.

The first useful case is the Linux Kernel Markers, which really needs a
completely boolean if: active or inactive. That would be a good test
case to get gcc support.
