I had the same problem on my machine and it stemmed from accidentally setting
/proc/sys/kernel/shmall to "0" (that is the maximum number of SHM segments).
In my cas I used some /psoc/sys tweaking utility at a time where this value
was unknown (other kernel) and that utility then set kernel.shmall in
/etc/sysctl.conf to 0. You might check that.
