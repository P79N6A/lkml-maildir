Used if there's no HW IOMMU *and* it's needed (because you have >4GB
memory) or you told the kernel to use it (iommu=soft).

Calgary is found in pSeries servers, but also in high-end xSeries
(Intel based) servers. It would be a little awkward if pSeries servers
(which are based on PowerPC processors) used code under arch/x86-64

Patches happily accepted :-)
