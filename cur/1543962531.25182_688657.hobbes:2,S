Definitely possible.  The last similar change happened in December and
took until March until I ran out of stupid regressions from it.  Most
likely there are still some I just haven't found yet.
The question is when to draw the line and say "This is useful as-is for
a sufficient number of users."  I don't have a good answer to it.  I
certainly expect more changes in the future, including format changes.
And if we wait for them all to happen, it won't get merged this decade.
Not sure.
