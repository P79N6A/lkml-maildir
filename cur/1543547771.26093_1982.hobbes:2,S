This is a well-known bug.
I described the cause on Mon, 14 Aug 2000, and soon afterwards
priikone@poseidon.pspt.fi sent a corrected (I hope - didnt check)
patch to l-k. (Look for: Pekka Riikonen, Re: devfs / eth micro-problems)
I see that this patch didnt make it into 2.4.0test7.
Perhaps it should be resubmitted.
