Yes I know it's all the same. However unfortunately
it's *not easy* to back out the ->special use from
the drivers that do it. We have the following sutuation:
1. Generic BIO code checking for ->special and deciding whatever
it should trying to merge request or not.
2. Gneric ATA code setting ->special for ata_request passing.
3. CD-ROM ATAPI code using ->special for passing packet commands
and failed commands.
4. ide-scsi using it for the same purspose as CD-ROM
5. ide-floppy not using it at all buf abusing the ->buffer member
    for precisely the same purpose.
And unfortunately there is *no* easy solution for any of the
above circumstances without breaking far too many things.
The conclusion simply is: unless the above issues are fixed
the TCQ stuff has simply to be backed out again anbd live
separately from the main code chain. :-(.
