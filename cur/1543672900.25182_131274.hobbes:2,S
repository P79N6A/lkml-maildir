Actually... I think they all use the same one (Even the Solaris/IRIX/Cray ones
do that). All of them provide a filesystem interface via VFS. The Linux ones
were implemented via the "userfs" core or NFS.
There is also OpenAFS which gives access to a remote HSM... but that can
be considered just a NFS equivalent.
