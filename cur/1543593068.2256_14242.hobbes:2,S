To tangent a little bit, and add netdev to the CC...
The loss and regain of link status should be proactively signalled to
userspace using netlink or something similar.  Currently we have
netif_carrier_{on,off,ok} but it is only passively checked. 
netif_carrier_{on,off} should probably schedule_task() to fire off a
netlink message...
For your HA application specifically, right now, I would suggest making
sure your net driver calls netif_carrier_xxx correctly, then checking
for IFF_RUNNING interface flag.  IFF_RUNNING will disappear if the
interface is up, but there is no carrier [as according to
netif_carrier_ok].
