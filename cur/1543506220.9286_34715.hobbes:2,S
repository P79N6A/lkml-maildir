I don't know that it matters.  I compile kernels for various
different machines, and I do all the compiling on ONE machine.
ALL of the machines have the Linux root filesystem on a different
partition.  I do:
make dep ; make bzImage ; make modules ; make modules_install
When it is done, I move the config, bzImage (or zImage),
System.map, and module directory all to a separate dir, and make
a tarball.  I then distribute this tarball to the machine in
question.  When I unzip the tarball, I move the files into /boot,
and /lib/modules.  I then edit lilo.conf and tell it about the
new kernel.  I don't run rdev, or any other such thing.  The
kernels ALWAYS boot properly, and if I move them to a totally
different machine, they still work correctly.
So, I don't think it matters where the root partition is at all,
as long as it is IDE or SCSI (depending on the machine type).
I've never had any trouble with it anyways.
Take care!
