We've run into a problem with the definition of struct stat
that appears in kernel 2.0.36 and later (or maybe it's a libc6
problem).  Specifically, st_dev is declared as a __dev_t, which 
under gcc is a typedef of "long long."  However, under any 
other compiler (i.e. one that does not define __GNUC__), it is 
a typedef of a struct containing an array of two integers:
from <gnu/types.h>:
   #ifdef __GNUC__
   typedef unsigned long long int __u_quad_t;
   typedef long long int __quad_t;
   #else
   typedef struct
     {
       long int __val[2];
     } __quad_t;
   typedef struct
     {
       __u_long __val[2];
     } __u_quad_t;
   #endif
   typedef __u_quad_t __dev_t;     /* Type of device numbers.  */
Perhaps this is a libc6 problem, but it seems the kernel is
very closely connected in this case.  I saw hints to this 
problem in the linux-kernel archives (there was some discussion 
about coordination between the kernel and libc teams).
Our problem, though, I think is somewhat different.  When we
use lcc to compile, say, the Spec95 benchmark suite, it emits
compile-time errors in the builds of gcc and perl.  These
two benchmarks compare st_dev for equality, and we all know
that it is illegal in C to compare two structs.
If a 64-bit device number is desired, why not declare it
"long long" explicitly?  Why all this hiding behind __GNUC__?
Just say what you want and let the compiler implement the 
non-standard type.  Declaring it as a struct breaks code that
was written years ago.  At least with "long long," the compiler 
has a resonable chance of being updated to support it.
If there is a solution to this problem, please direct me to the
proper information.
Thanks!
