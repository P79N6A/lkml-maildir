Oh... it was rather significantly in the AM when I posted so I forgot to
mention in the haste to get this out of the way but it was Pete Clements
who reported the regression:
http://www.nabble.com/Lost-Sound-from-2.6.24-to-2.6.25----CS4236-ISA-tc17062547.html
He also tested it, so as long as we're name-mention-flattering around...
And this a good excuse to ask how you edit changelog after the fact. Just
reset/reapply and stuff or is there a "better" way? I fairly frequently
find myself wanting to do just that but it's a bit of a mess when there's
already commits on top.
Rene.
