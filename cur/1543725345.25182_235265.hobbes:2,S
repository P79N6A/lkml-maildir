Hello,
I ported Takahashi-san's memory hotplug patches for hugetlbpages to 
ia64.
The patches are against linux 2.6.7 and work with memory hotplug 
patches which Iwamoto-san, Takahashi-san and Terasawa-san posted.
Restriction:
  * There still remains a problem that patch [15/16] and [16/16] 
    posted by Takahashi-san on July 14 could not be compiled on IA64.
    Now I am considering it.
    At ia64, please don't apply the above patches.
How to apply:
  1) First of all, apply patches which are posted by Takahashi-san
     on July 14 without [15-16/16]. 
　2) Then, aplly all of Terasawa-san's patches.
  3) And, apply this set of patches.
Thank you,
Nobuhiko Yoshida.
