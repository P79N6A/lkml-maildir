Hi Jeff!
I tested this patch on my T60 (Intel ICH7) 
against git 78b656b8bf933101b42409b4492734b23427bfc3
with the same result: during boot, I get
scsi0: ahci
ata1: port is slow to respond, pls be patient
ata1: port failed to respond (30 sec)
ata1: soft reset failed (device not ready)
ata1: soft reset failed retrying in 5 secs
etc
after a while everything recovers and seems to work OK
afterwards, but still this seems to add about a minute or so
to the boot time.
I'm not sure how to test whether I get the speedup that you
mention.
Hope this report helps.
