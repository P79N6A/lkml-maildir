Hi All,
When I copy larger files with scp over the network then suddenly the keyboard hangs. This never happend with any kernel < 2.4.20. Interestingly is that i can't trigger it with a "normal" ssh session...
Also intersting is that my mouse is still working and I can shutdown xwindow with the mouse. But then the only keys which are working are alt-sysrq-*.
When the keyboard hangs it's also impossibel to connect to the machine with ssh over the network..
Is it already known?
Thank you
Marc
