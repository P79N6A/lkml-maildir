Will those updates fix the smp issues with dvb-ttpci ?
As I wrote before, i'm not in a position where i can fix it myself.
I read a lot of people had to move their dvb card to a single-cpu (non
ht one) because of the crashes.
at moment i can't buy another box neither can I offer the
dvb-mainteners a smp box.
Thanks for your work.
