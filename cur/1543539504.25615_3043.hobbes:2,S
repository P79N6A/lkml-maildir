Ahh, but you've set up an impossible burden.  It is _impossible_
for the kernel to ensure that a malicious hacker who has obtained
root on your machine does not destroy your hardware.  After all,
that hacker can always re-install an old, unsafe kernel version
and ioctl() away, or even bit-bang directly to the raw device!
