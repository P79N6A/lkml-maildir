Dear kernel-hackers,
I compiled kernel 2.4.0test9-pre1 (kernel names are a real mess
these days ...) and noticed that /proc/sys/vm/freepages is no
longer writable:
[root@oscar] ll /proc/sys/vm/freepages
-r--r--r--    1 root     root            0 Sep 17 02:25 /proc/sys/vm/freepages
If this was intentional, why has it changed ?
thanks,
Patrick
