Stephen,
Have you or can you run these tests directly against a buffered block
device (bypassing the filesystem) and see if it still behaves correctly?
I have a Java app that does this and 2.4.0-prerelease shows a cumulative
sync() time. As I write more data, sync times take longer and longer
and never comes back down. It takes writing 30-50 megs cumulative (many
syncs along the way) to become noticable. Noticable are latencies in   
the 20-30 ms range (up from 0-1 at the start of the test). Eventually  
the test comes to a grinding halt with all of it's time spent in the 
kernel.
I don't know when this happened in 2.4.0-testxx, but 2.2.x does not
show this behavior.
