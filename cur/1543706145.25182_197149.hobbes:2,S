Are you suggesting branching the user mode code from the kernel mode code?
Duplication is not the same as sharing code - you have twice the number of
places that require fixing in the event of a bug.  If we can help it, we'd
like to avoid this.

IBAL provides APIs for accessing InfiniBand resources in both the kernel and
in user-mode.  Those APIs are identical, and many of the files are shared
between user and kernel mode.  In the kernel, storage drivers, network
drivers, and SDP interface to the kernel IBAL driver.  In user mode, the
subnet manager, uDAPL, MPI, and other IB-enabled applications interface to
the user-mode IBAL library.  The reason a user-mode library is provided is
that InfiniBand provides mechanisms to bypass the kernel for speed path
operations - send, receive, and completion processing - similarly to VI.
Bypassing the kernel for these operations helps provide higher bandwidths
and lower latencies to applications.
The user-mode IBAL library depends on the kernel mode IBAL driver to setup
InfiniBand resources for use, and for the operations that can't be
offloaded, like memory registrations.  Further, the kernel IBAL driver
tracks user-mode resources on a per-process basis to ensure they are freed
if an application seg faults.  This is a must so that things like memory
registrations get cleaned up and the associated memory unlocked even in
abnormal application termination situations.
I hope this clears up why code is shared between user-mode and kernel mode.
