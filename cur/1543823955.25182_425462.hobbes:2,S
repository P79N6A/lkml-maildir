If nothing has yet been transferred to/from userspace, return -EFAULT.
If something has been transferred, return the number of bytes transferred.

The filesystem driver needs to handle it somehow.

Actually, fs/direct-io.c cheats and doesn't implement the correct
semantics.  It returns either all-bytes-transferred or -EFOO.  The way I
justify that is to point out that returning a partial transfer count
doesn't make a lot of sense when the I/Os could complete in any order -
yes, we know how much data got transferred, but we don't know whereabouts
in the user's memory that data ended up.  So the user cannot trust _any_ of
it.
NFS direct-io can do the same.
But access_ok() isn't sufficient.  All it tells you is that the virtual
address is a legal one for an application.  But we could still get EFAULT
when trying to access it.
