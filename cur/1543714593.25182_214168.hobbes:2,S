Its not impossible. You basically may not write to disk after you save
snapshot... Or you can keep the logs to be able to revert disk state.
Its possible but pretty hard.

Heh... It would actually make for good april-fools rfc :-).
You could make machine where any action can be undone within five seconds...
...but you'd need mdelay(5000) in send packet path, and that would kind-of suck.
