hopefully someone will merge the code, I also noticed that the tulip.c
in the devel kernel is broken badly for SMP, it gets about one TX error
for each packet sent. Works fine in a UP kernel on the same box. 
Alan Cox mentioned that the tulip driver problems are something that has
to be cleaned up before 2.2.0 
btw, anyone know where the documentation for the fast routing stuff is?
or just work it out from the source? :)
(ie is there a web site or something about the fast routing and such)
	See You
