You have gotten most of an answer, unless someone make a fireware to 
USB2 adaptor you are going to have to go slow or run firewire.
I would think the framerate could be quite slow and still be useful. 
What software do you use to do the detection (curiousity only)? Of 
course after you detect motion you probably want to up the framerate, so 
  you can see what's really happening.
