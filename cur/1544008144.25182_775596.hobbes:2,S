If you screw up so royally as to allocate every page in the machine
and free it with bad state, yes, that's indeed the way it will tend.
Or, to the extent that you're relying on high orders and low zones,
it will happen even sooner.  Same as if you screw up and forget to
free your pages.
That's okay.  In more normal cases you'll see the warnings before
it's dead, and shutdown and reboot (hopefully a different kernel!)
before it reaches that state.  By the time your patches reach -mm,
I'd hope you'll have weeded out the immediate OOM cases.
