I am pleased to announce the availability of 
   mdadm version 1.0.0
It is available at
   
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
as both a source tar-ball, as an SRPM, and as an RPM for i386.
mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.
mdadm incorporates much of the functionality of raidtools, though with
a very different interface, and also provides extra functionality
including:
   - monitoring array and alerting admin staff of issues
   - moving spares between arrays as needed
   - assembling arrays based on superblock content
   - displaying details of arrays and of superblocks
The release of version 1 is intended to suggest that mdadm is
   - feature-complete
   - reasonably bug-free
   - reasonably well documented.
I hope not to make another release until md driver enhancements
necessitate it, but we will have to wait and see....
Note: mdadm was previously known as 'mdctl'.  It is the same tool,
just a different name.
Development of mdadm is sponsored by CSE@UNSW: 
  The School of Computer Science and Engineering
at
  The University of New South Wales
