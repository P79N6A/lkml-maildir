Oh, yes. And both assume that graph doesn't change under them. Which is
patently false in case of filesystem. You have a single-threaded code -
good for you, but VFS is _not_ single-threaded. And locking everybody out
of VFS for the time of symlink lookup is not an option. One of the reasons
being that symlink lookup may trigger automounter. Which will need to
access VFS.

Sorry, but realpath() _is_ dangerous unless you control every step of the
chain and are sure that nothing will change. That is, if you base
behaviour on its results. I'm less than happy with the concept of this
beast, BTW - WTF _is_ path to file, in the first place? If it's just a
normalization - sorry, it doesn't work (obviously - there are files with
i_nlinks > 1).

Why?

<gaaack> Let me guess: you had the structure changing. And you were not
responsible for backups, right? Anyway, you have 32. And if somebody wants
more I'm more than comfortable with telling lusers where they can shove
their requests. Done that. More than once.

You know, distributions pick a lot of junk and it's not the kernel fault.
As for the kernel growth... I think that during this Autumn I did about
-3Kloc, maybe more. Quite a bit was in symlinks patch, BTW. Notice that
volume and bloat are different things - if you will look at the sizes of
different parts you'll see that kernel proper is not growing like hell.
Now, drivers... Anyway, thanks $DEITY, the thing is not even close to
EMACS in featuritis.

See above. You have a single-threaded code.
