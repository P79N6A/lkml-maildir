There's an OLD tool called "irqtune"
         
http://www.best.com/~cae/irqtune
by Craig Estey, which says about itself:
   "irqtune changes the IRQ priority of devices to allow devices
    that require high priority and fast service 
    (e.g. serial ports, modems) to have it...."
I'm told it still works even with recent kernels, but could 
someone comment on how good an idea it is and if there are
better and newer ways to do this with recent kernels.
Thanks,
