I knew *that* part.  Closer look at drivers/firmware/dmi-id.c indicates that
it's likely a busticated DMI field in my BIOS - looking around at the stuff in
/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id I found that the files product_version, board_version
board_asset_tag, chassis_version, and chassis_asset_tag are empty (trying
to 'cat' them gets just a \n) - the other values all look sane.
This looks fishy:
#define ADD_DMI_ATTR(_name, _field)         if (dmi_get_system_info(_field))                 sys_dmi_attributes[i++] = & sys_dmi_##_name##_attr.attr;
Should that be making a check that it's not pointing at a null string?
