Hi!
Is there any "standard" way to handle _one_ function in _one_ driver where the 
hardware is divided into something like a platform device (some registers are 
fixed in the chipset) and a PCI part? To bring the function up, registers in 
both parts must be programmed and they depend on each other.
Will this driver be more a PCI driver or more a platform driver?
Or is it possible to add the platform like resources to the PCI list of 
resources of my PCI device (to handle it as a PCI device only)?
Regards
Juergen
