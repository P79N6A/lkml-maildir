I don't see anywere that Matt was criticising Ingo's work.  He just said 
that it wasn't hard realtime--which is true.
A hard realtime system will *guarantee* that the deadlines will be met, 
*no matter what*.  It makes all kinds of other sacrifices to do it, and 
it makes additional demands on the application designer as well.
I don't think Ingo would claim that his patches make Linux a hard RT 
operating system.
