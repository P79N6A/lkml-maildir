Ok, we need to fix that... Please to the following:
echo -n 5 > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/resync_time
echo 1 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug
... wait 10 seconds ...
move the mouse slightly
... wait another 10 seconds ...
move the mouse slighty again
echo 0 > /sys/modules/i8042/parameters/debug
and send me your dmesg (or better /var/log/messages or whatever file
you use for kernel messages).
Thanks!
