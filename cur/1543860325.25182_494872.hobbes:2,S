Andrew,
The kmap_atomic-debugging patch checks twice for (type !=
KM_SKB_SUNRPC_DATA). The right check would be to look for
KM_SKB_DATA_SOFTIRQ, as added by the following patch.  I've read the
mail, in which you mentioned that you spotted a copy-n-paste error in
kmap_atomic, I suppose that you refered to this, but just in case...
Regards,
Frederik
