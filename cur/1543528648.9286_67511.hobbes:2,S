I checked 2.3.34 and it seems the problem is still there: the perm
checking code in send_sig_info() is the same as 2.2.x, SI_SIGIO still
has a negative value, and the macro SI_FROMUSER(siptr) is still
defined as (siptr)->si_code <= 0.
If you need to use realtime signals with F_SETSIG, I suggest you
apply the workaround I suggested in my posting: replace
the definition of SI_FROMUSER in asm-i386/siginfo.h with
#define SI_FROMUSER(siptr) ((siptr)->si_code <= 0 && \
                                  (siptr)->si_code >= SI_QUEUE)
I'am using this and I've had no problems so far, but I realize 
it's only a workaround: I'd like someone commented about my proposed
solution: changing the definition of SI_SIGIO, SI_ASYNCIO, SI_MESGQ
and SI_TIMER to positive values. I think this would solve the problem
and would make the realtime signals more compliant with The Single Unix
specification.
bye,
Alessandro
