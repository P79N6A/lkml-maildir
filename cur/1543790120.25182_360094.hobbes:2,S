Stefan,
   we are supposed to be on a 2-month release cycle, with all major changes 
going in in the first two weeks of that cycle. This timeframe doesn't 
leave you any noticable time to implement your steps seperatly (and zero 
testing between them). as a result, in practice your proposal amounts to a 
big-bang approach, and/or results in releases that are known-broken.
and while you suggest putting this in -mm, remember that the -mm kernel 
needs to be useable so that people can test it, and it is on the same 
schedule as the main kernel so again you can't have known-broken things 
(of this scale) there either.
