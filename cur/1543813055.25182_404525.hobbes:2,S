this patch appears to change the ABI! That is bad bad bad.
Also, how can you guarantee that "current" is valid and meaningful at
the place you use it to get the user id ??
Also the process ID part is really bogus, after all the process may have
exited by the time the inotify client gets to it, and the PID may even
already have been reused.
