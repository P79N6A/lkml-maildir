One thing that would make that easier in the future is if contributers
at least started to dual-license their submissions.  I.e. if instead
of "GPL version 2", one could say "GPL version 2 or GPL version 3".
It isn't the same thing as the problematic "GPL version 2 or later",
because the developer is not agreeing to an unseen license (GPLv4,
etc).  What it does do is make it easier to move to GPLv3 a few years
from now, if that is decided then, as a significant fraction of the
code will already be GPLv3 compatible.  That way, if a reason is ever
found to move to v3, at least some of the work will already be done.
