The first thing I would suggest would be to use data=writeback for the
mysql partitions.  The easiest way to figure out what is causing the
latencies is to get the output from sysrq-t during one of the stalls.
(see Documentation/sysrq.txt for details on enabling sysrq).
Since mysql is probably triggering tons of fsyncs or O_SYNC writes,
you may want to increase the size of the ext3 log.
If mysql is constantly appending to the files holding your tables, the
synchronous writes are more expensive and log intensive.  Check your
setup to see if you can manually extend any of those files to avoid
constantly growing table files.
