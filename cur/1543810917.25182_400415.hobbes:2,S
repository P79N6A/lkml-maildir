[4295106.524000] raid6: using algorithm sse1x2 (2339 MB/s)

I just loaded the raid6 module for fun (might end up using it one day), and I 
was surprised at its choice of algorithm. By the messages above, I would have 
assumed it would choose the mmxx2 algorithm at 2500 MB/s instead of sse1x2 at 
the slightly slower 2339 MB/s. This is probably entirely expected behaviour, but 
why?
Cheers,
Chris
