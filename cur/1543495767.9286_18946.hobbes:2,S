Thanks to all who responded to my queries about native Linux support
for not just "plain" RAID-5 controllers, but also for monitoring etc.
the controller. I've found out that (I'll list the homepages, that's
easier for all) www.ami.com, www.icp-vortex.com and www.mylex.com (see
also 
http://www.dandelion.com/Linux/
) have excellent support for Linux.
It's interesting to see that in this area there is more support for
Linux than for Solaris x86 (which we also use)!  The only one that
currently has *some* support is AMI, but the software we had crashes
when using it on a VGA-less system as it apparently tries to mmap() the
VGA memory... I have *no* idea why one would want to do that (and
frankly I don't want to know).
