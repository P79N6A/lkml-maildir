Hi Gurus,
I was trying to build a super-big kernel with allot of Journaling File
System inside it to try out what is best for us to use. Now, I
encountered a problem..
It seems like both IBM's JFS and ext3 wants to use fs/jfs .. IMHO that
is like asking for problem.. A more logic location for ext3 should be
fs/ext3, no?
Anyway, just my thought... It might already been discussed for what I
know.. 
BTW.. If you find time to reply on this post, please put me on the Cc:
line - I am not on the mailinglist, generates too much mail I have no
time to read...
Best regards
 Michael Boman
PS
 I was using 2.2.17 as base for my patches..
