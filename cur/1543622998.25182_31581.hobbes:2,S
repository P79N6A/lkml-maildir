The in-kernel driver doesn't support the MiniPCI Prism2.5 wireless cards,
Use the linux-wlan-ng driver from www.linux-wlan.org.
I have almost exactly the same machine and have been running Linux on it for
months.  I've found that it's one of the few laptops on which virtually
everything is supported by linux.  The only thing unsupported is the Lucent
AMR modem. (And I suppose the security chip widgets, but i wouldn't use those
anyway).
