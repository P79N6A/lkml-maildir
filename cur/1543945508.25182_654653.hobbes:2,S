Subject: git-xtensa doesn't like my cross compiler

With git-xtensa I'm getting:
<--  snip  -->
...
/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.6/git/linux-2.6/arch/xtensa/Makefile:30: *** No Xtensa toolchain found on PATH..  Stop.
make: *** [sub-make] Error 2
<--  snip  -->
My xtensa cross toolchain is prefixed xtensa-linux- and 
arch/xtensa/Makefile shouldn't make any assumptions regarding how the 
cross compiler is named.
