Hi all
To solve my opengl problem i recently (2 days ago) upgraded from kernel 
2.4.5 to 2.4.17. Each time i boot my system, after it has been turned 
off for appr. 1-2 hours or so, I experience lots of problems the 
following errors have already occured:
C1: respawning too fast (actually for C1 to C5 or something alike)
the day after: something went wrong when attempting to mount the root fs 
and some pointer (????[0]->???) error occured. I forgot what it was 
exactly, and nothing is logged because rootfs is still ro. a few hours 
later when i got back home i booted my pc and got:
OOPS 0000 for almost each process being started afterwards this was in 
my syslog this was all for that boot:
Jan 24 12:58:05 (none) kernel: Unknown bridge resource 0: assuming 
transparent
Jan 24 12:58:05 (none) kernel: Unknown bridge resource 2: assuming 
transparent
Jan 24 12:58:05 (none) kernel: agpgart: agpgart: Detected an Intel i815, 
but could not find the secondary device. Assuming a non-integrated video 
card.
Jan 24 12:58:05 (none) kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request at 
virtual address 646c726f
Jan 24 12:58:05 (none) kernel: *pde = 00000000
I never had this problem running kernel 2.4.5
