This, I think, is a problem on i386. You _cannot_ read beyond the end of the
string (might be on an other, unmapped page), but you don't know that until
you do, when doing 4 bytes at a time. I mean: You can only know that you
went to far...
ia64 DOES allow this by doing the memload conditional and allowing
soft/local pagefaults to end the loop. Ask the Trilian guys about this if
you want to know more...
