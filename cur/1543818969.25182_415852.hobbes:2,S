with previous load balancer code it was a good point.. because all tasks
were weighted the same from load balancer perspective.. but now the
imbalance represents what task to move (atleast in the working
cases :)

you mean the highest priority task on the current active list of the new 
run queue, right?
There will be some unnecessary movements of high priority tasks because of
this...
