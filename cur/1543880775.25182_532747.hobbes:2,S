per-file pagesizes are just the granularity that is available. The order
value is then readily available for all page cache operations. In practice 
it is likely that filesystems will have one consistent page size. If you 
look at the ramfs implementation then you will see that is exactly the
approach taken here. I want to avoid any modifications to key data 
structures or locking. If possible straight code transformation.

The superpages? I do not think that we should be getting that complicated 
here. Maybe we can pick up some ideas at some point.

Well that is the difference between academia where one gets his Ph.D. for
superpages, publishes a couple of papers and then its over and real 
kernel work where this actually will have to work consistently with the 
rest of the system. Let us thus do small steps towards the goal 
while keeping things as simple and straightforward as possible.
