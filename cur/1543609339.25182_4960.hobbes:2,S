A quick squint at menuconfig in 2.4.13 offers CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV:
  Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
  specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
  devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.
  It is also used for "consumer keys" on multimedia keyboards and
  USB speakers.
  This module supports these devices separately using a separate
  event interface on /dev/usb/hiddevX (char 180:96 to 180:111).
  This driver requires CONFIG_USB_HID.
IMHO this may offer the functionality that's disappeared - whilst I also
have a Natural Keyboard, I've yet to bother mapping the consumer keys.
Cheers,
Greg.
