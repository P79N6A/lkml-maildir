2.5.39 won't compile for me "out of the box".  I thought it might have 
been the toolset, but I was running RH8 and it has gcc 3.2.  Was there a 
big change between 3.2 and 3.3.2 in Fedora Core 1?  The reason I ask is 
that I also can't get NISTNet to compile on Fedora Core 1 or RHEL WS 3.  
It looks like incompatible libraries.
