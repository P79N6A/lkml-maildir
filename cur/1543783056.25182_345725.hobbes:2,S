ip_queue messages already include the source mac address in the hw_addr
field. The destination isn't included because except with bridge
netfilter it is always the local mac address. If you also need the
destination MAC we could consider including it in nfnetlink_queue
since its new and we don't have to worry about userspace compatibility
at this time.
