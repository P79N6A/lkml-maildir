Not an issue.  We already copy struct thread_info when switching stacks
on i386 with 4K stacks.  x86_64 always has multiple stacks, but uses
thread_info in the first stack, even on a stack switch.

Solved for simple configurations.  But when you start nesting
flesystems, especially if a network filesystem is involved, then the
small amounts of stack used by each subsystem add up fast.

4K stacks on x86_64 are not a real option.  If i386 needs 4K then
x86_64 needs twice as much just to handle the doubling of pointers and
saved arguments.
>I'm not quite certain where we could insert calls to call_on_new_stack,
It has to be at a point that can return an error.  The best place is at
the start of the block and VFS layers, if those layers can detect that
they are about to do a nested call.  For example, crypto over loopback
over ext3 over NFS over software raid over SCSI.  The loopback, ext3
and NFS layers are nested filesystems calls, crypto is not.  The SCSI
layer is a nested block layer call, software raid is not.  So loopback,
ext3, NFS and SCSI would switch to a new stack if necessary.

I have just resigned and will be taking a long break away from
computers.  Feel free to play with the idea, otherwise I will look at
it again sometime in October.
