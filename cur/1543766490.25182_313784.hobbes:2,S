No, this does not help.
The failure is now inside "ip_route_output_slow", since the reversed address packet has the source address of the remote machine, and the call to "ip_dev_find" fails to find a device with matching address.
In 2.4 the okfn pointer used to point to "ip_queue_xmit2" which evaluated the new route from scratch. 
It was passed in as the completion function when calling the NF_HOOK chain.
In 2.6 this function is gone (replaced with a reference to "dst_output).
Was removing it a mistake?

Does this patch fix your problem?
