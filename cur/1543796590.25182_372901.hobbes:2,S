Think of SoftMAC as an extension to ieee80211.

Well, I do not care for drivers ignoring SoftMAC and duplicating
the work. The question is: Why don't these drivers use SoftMAC?
(Yeah, because it is incomplete, is the answer. :D I am talking
about future.)
What is so hard about a driver including ieee80211.h _and_
ieee80211softmac.h, if it requires Software MAC? And what
exactly is duplicated work here? SoftMAC does _not_ duplicate;
it extends.
