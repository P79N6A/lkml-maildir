It looks like a very simple starvation control:
thread 1:
	for(;;) {
		F_LOCK
		<do a few seconds work>
		F_UNLCK
	}
thread 2:
	F_LOCK.
If there is no yield after unlock, thread 2 might never receive the lock.
Is it possible to figure out if someone is waiting on the lock? F_UNLCK 
should schedule, if there is a waiter with higher priority.
