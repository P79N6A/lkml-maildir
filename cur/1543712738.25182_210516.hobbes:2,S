Can you explain this a little more ?  What does b->data and b->commited_data 
represent ?  We are assuming that b->data will always be uptodate. 
May be we should use ext3_test_allocatable() also.
Mingming, what was the reason for using ext3_find_next_zero_bit() only ?
We had this discussion earlier, but I forgot :(

Hmm. Ted proposed that we should keep reservation after file close. 
We weren't sure about this either. Its on our TODO list.

Thanks. will use that. We are using debugfs for now. Do you have any tools
to dump out whats in journal ? I want to understand log format etc.. 
Just curious.

We are first concentrating on tiobench regression. We see clear
degrade with tiobench on ext3, since it creates lots of files in the
same directory. Once we are happy with tiobench, we go for others
kernel untars, rawiobench etc.
Thanks,
