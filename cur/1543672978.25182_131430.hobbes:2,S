Yeah, ok.

And at least on older kernels (don't know about 2.5) it gives you
not "anything" but the next free memory region above that address.

    "A non-zero value of addr is taken to be a suggestion of a
     process address near which the mapping should be placed."

No new flag.  No new semantic.  Everything's already there...
