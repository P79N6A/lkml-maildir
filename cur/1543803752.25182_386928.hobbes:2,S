Neil, is this online resizing/reshaping really needed?  I understand
all those words means alot for marketing persons - zero downtime,
online resizing etc, but it is much safer and easier to do that stuff
'offline', on an inactive array, like raidreconf does - safer, easier,
faster, and one have more possibilities for more complex changes.  It
isn't like you want to add/remove drives to/from your arrays every day...
Alot of good hw raid cards are unable to perform such reshaping too.
