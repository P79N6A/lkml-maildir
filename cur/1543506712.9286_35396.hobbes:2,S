we recently received a quad CPU Intel server in our lab that didn't come
with any hard drives.  no manuals either.  it has an NCR53C810 and two
NCR53896 SCSI controllers.
i purchased a 9.1g cheetah drive with an SCA connector and installed it
into the box, and installed RH 6.0.  when the machine came up, i
downloaded kernel 2.2.11 and installed it, but after rebooting, the
machine panic'd, unable to find it's root partition. under 2.2.11, the
NCR53C8xx driver doesn't find any of the SCSI devices.
so i tried rebooting with the default RedHat SMP kernel, and it panic'd
too, unable to mount the root partition.  my 2.0.36 rescue disk and the RH
5.2 install CD-ROM claim that the partition table is invalid, and the NCR
driver in those kernels goes into a loop if i try to re-initialize.
i've checked alan's 2.2.11 errata, but didn't see anything there related
to this problem.  are there known issues with the cheetah disks?  am i
missing a boot option?  any help appreciated.
