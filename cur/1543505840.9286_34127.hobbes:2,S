My appologies to the list.  This is to hopefully pre-empt anymore
messages to the list.
There are currently a few projects working on the DVD issues for linux.  I
suggest heading over to:
http://linuxdvd.corepower.com
and
http://livid.on.openprojects.net
These two sites have mailing lists associated with them (both archived on
the sites) and should provide you with the best information available for
issues surrounding DVD-Video playing on linux.  If anyone has any
questions about this feel free to mail me off-list and I'll try to help
however I can.  This isn't the place for a discussion on DVD hardware
support as there are a lot of issues (very few technical, mostly
legal and licensing) to get through before that becomes a
real possibility/issue.
