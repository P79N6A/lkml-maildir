Alan,
There are some VM patches which should be included IMO.
 - Andrea's backport of balance_dirty_state from 2.4. The patch only
changes the time which kflushd is activated, thus it doesnt affect
stability.
- The small WRITEA patch. With it, the kernel is stable as pre9 (tested
with 8Mb box), though with decent interactiveness under high IO.
