Just to clarify this - the cases that currently need an array of task
pointers *do* already traverse tasklist in order to locate those tasks
as needed - its when they want to be able to operate on those tasks
outside of the tasklist lock that the array is needed - lock
tasklist_lock, fill the array with tasks (with added refcounts), drop
tasklist_lock, do stuff.
