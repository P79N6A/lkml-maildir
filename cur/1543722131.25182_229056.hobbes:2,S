It appears we have a conflict between what BitKeeper thinks is a source 
file, and what kbuild thinks is a source file:
	[jgarzik@sata linux-2.6]$ bk -r co -Sq
	[jgarzik@sata linux-2.6]$ make distclean
	  CLEAN   scripts/package
	[jgarzik@sata linux-2.6]$ bk -r co -Sq
	[jgarzik@sata linux-2.6]$ make distclean
	  CLEAN   scripts/package
What info can I provide to help debug this?
	Jeff
