You aren't dumping and restoring the entropy pool; you are dumping 
random data generated by the pool, and using that data to stir the new 
entropy pool after the next boot.  There is no direct relationship 
between the entropy of the old and new pools.  The kernel needs to 
decide how much entropy you added based on how much random data you 
provide it with to stir the pool.
