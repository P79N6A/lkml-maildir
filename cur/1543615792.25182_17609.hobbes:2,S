i'm afraid that while 32 might work, 8 will definitely not be enough. In
the interactivity-detection scheme i added it's important for interactive
tasks to have some room (in terms of priority levels) to go up without
hitting the levels of the true CPU abusers.
we can do 32-bit ffz by doing 4x 8-bit ffz's though:
	if (likely(byte[0]))
		return ffz8[byte[0]];
	else if (byte[1])
		return ffz8[byte[1]];
	else if (byte[2]
		return ffz8[byte[2]];
	else if (byte[3]
		return ffz8[byte[3]];
	else
		return -1;
and while this is still 4 branches, it's better than a loop of 32. But i
also think that George Anzinger's idea works well too to reduce the cost
of bitsearching. Or those platforms that decide to do so could search the
arrray directly as well - if it's 32 queues then it's a cache footprint of
4 cachelines, which can be searched directly without any problem.
