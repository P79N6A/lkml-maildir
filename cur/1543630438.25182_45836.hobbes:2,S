No. The only possibility I can see is if the extra checks are causing
extra cache invalidations. I don't why that should be the case, but
then again I'm not able to reproduce those numbers...

Check the patch: it doesn't invalidate the cache when the mtime stays
the same. A tcpdump would show whether this is the case or not.
I would be interested to see if this is something that is related to
nfs-server only. (I.e. whether or not Mario can see the same problem
with knfsd.)
