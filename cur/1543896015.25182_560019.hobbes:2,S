I meant the first first (0th).

EH occurs during boot, suspend and resume all the time.  It just runs in
quiet mode to avoid disturbing the users too much.  In your case, EH is
kicking in due to actual exception conditions so it's being verbose to
give clue about what's going on.
It's really weird tho.  The PHY RDY status changed events are coming
from the device which is NOT used while resuming and it's before any
actual PM events are triggered.  Your kernel just boots, swsusp realizes
it's resuming and tries to read memory image from the swap device.
While reading, the disk controller raises consecutive PHY readiness
changed interrupts.  EH recovers them alright but the end result seems
to indicate that the loaded image is corrupt.
So, there's no device suspend/resume code involved at all.  The kernel
just booted and is trying to read data from the drive.  Please try with
only the first drive attached and see what happens.
Thanks.
