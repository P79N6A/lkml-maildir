One more question:
I use a "shell" cbc(aes) algorithm which chooses between
cryptd(__cbc-aes-aesni) and __cbc-aes-aesni according to context. But
the struct ablkcipher_request passed in can not be used for cryptd(*).
This can be resolved by allocating another struct ablkcipher_request for
cryptd(*) for each incoming struct ablkcipher_request. But is there any
better solution?
