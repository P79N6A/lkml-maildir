This change depends on "ide-floppy: use an xfer_func_t and io_buf_t typedefs
in order to unify rw" which was not in the "v2.5" series.
I took the patch #16/21 from the previous series and applied it manually
fixing rejects, please verify that I didn't brake something in the process.

I fixed the above to use __func__ while at it.
[ __FUNCTION__ is gcc-specific, __func__ is in C99 and is shorter ]
