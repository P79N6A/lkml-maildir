Greetings;
I have one of the advansys cards, and since the original check_region 
patch has been reverted now, I thought I'd turn on scsi debugging 
(kernel size += 12k) in my kernel build, and have rebooted to that 
2.6.6-mm5 kernel well before last nights amanda run.
However, no additional data seems to have been generated, either 
in /var/log/messages, nor anyplace else in the /var/log tree.
If it was generated, where did it go?
Amanda moved about 5 Gb of data thru that card ;ast night, and that 
*should* have generated some noise someplace I'd think.

Cheers, Gene
