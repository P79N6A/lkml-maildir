Hi, 
I had posted a question on increasing the scsi
read/write sectors  per command. I figured out some of
the things, but many questions still exist. 
I was wondering why the maximum writes I could get
from a single scsi write command could never exceed
204 
4096B  segments . I traced it to :  
static const int scsi_max_sg = PAGE_SIZE /
sizeof(struct scatterlist)
in scsi_merge.c .(which amounts to 204)  
Is this the limit of the maximum blocks we can
read/write through a single scsi command, atleast for
the given kernel (2.4.29) ? How can I increase
it??????
I am on a P3 Dell poweredgde 2400 . 
Sai
