I am not clear on scsi_reset requirement.  Here are the questions:
1, When scsi_reset called lower layer driver with SCSI_RESET_SYNCHRONOUS
   flag, should lower driver discard all commands since mid level
   driver will send all of them again (according to the comment in 
   scsi_obsolete.c)? Or all command should be returned with DID_ERROR
   status through scsi_done?
2, What happens if the flag is SCSI_RESET_ASYNCHRONOUS?  Should
   lower driver process all command as usual afetr reset?
3, Only SCSI_RESET_SUGGEST_HOST_RESET and SCSI_RESET_SUGGEST_BUS_RESET
   are available.  What if device reset is required?
Thanks!
