Subject: [PATCH] Input: HIDDEV - make HIDIOCSREPORT wait IO completion
From: Stefan Nickl <Stefan.Nickl@kontron.com>
Date: 1125903466 -0500
When trying to make the hiddev driver issue several Set_Report control
transfers to a custom device with 2.6.13-rc6, only the first transfer in a
row is carried out, while others immediately following it are silently
dropped.
This happens where hid_submit_report() (in hid-core.c) tests for
HID_CTRL_RUNNING, which seems to be still set because the first transfer is
not finished yet.
As a workaround, inserting a delay between the two calls to
ioctl(HIDIOCSREPORT) in userspace "solves" the problem.  The
straightforward fix is to add a call to hid_wait_io() to the implementation
of HIDIOCSREPORT (in hiddev.c), just like for HIDIOCGREPORT.  Works fine
for me.
Apparently, this issue has some history:
