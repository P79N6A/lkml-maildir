The "if" cannot be optimized away for the case in point, because it
does something (clears the bit) if it passes the test.  If I used WARN_ON
then it would have to be WARN_ON(1) in the else branch of the if.

This is not an argument against using USB's warn, it is an argument for
building warn on top of a centralized macro like WARN_ON or a friend.
All the best,
