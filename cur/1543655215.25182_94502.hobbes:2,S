   How about (as Adam suggested) two dma allocation API's
   1) dma_alloc_consistent which behaves identically to pci_alloc_consistent
   2) dma_alloc which can take the conformance flag and can be used to tidy up 
   the drivers that need to know about cache flushing.
Now that the situation is much more clear, I'm feeling a lot
better about this.
I have only one request, in terms of naming.  What we're really
doing is adding a third class of memory, it really isn't consistent
and it really isn't streaming.  It's inconsistent memory meant to
be used for "consistent memory things".
So could someone come up with a clever name for this thing? :-)
