struct kref does just that.  The kref api are just abstractions for 
refcounting which i presume is recommended for all refcounters in the
kernel.  I am just converting the struct file.f_count refcounter
to use kref with this patch.  
My actual intentions are to extend the kref api to do lock free refcounting 
and use that for the file.f_count refcounter, and make fd lookup lock 
free using rcu.  My earlier experiments with such patches showed 
performance improvements for threaded workloads which do lot of io.
Thanks,
Kiran
