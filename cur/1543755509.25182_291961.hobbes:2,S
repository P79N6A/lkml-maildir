For the record, I've been informed that the glibc mprotect() call
doesn't happen in any modern glibc's; there may have been one buggy
glibc that was released very briefly before it was fixed in the next
release.  But if that's what the paxtest developers are hanging their
hat on, it seems awfully lame to me.....
"desabotaged" seems like the correct description from my vantage
point.
