Hmm.. I seem to remember that all previous RSS rlimit attempts actually
fell flat on their face because of the reclaim-on-rss-overflow behavior;
in the shared page / cached page (equally important!) case, it means
process A (or container A) suddenly penalizes process B (or container B)
by making B have pagecache misses because A was using a low RSS limit.
Unmapping the page makes sense, sure, and even moving then to inactive
lists or whatever that is called in the vm today, but reclaim... that's
expensive...
