Ok, now I think to know what you are meaning: The program locking the door
should stay active until the CD-ROM should be unlocked, right ?
I always though about issuing some single call to lock or unlock the drive (e.g.
setcd), but I never thought about this. What do I have to do to make this
possible ? Could you give me some hint on how to allow root to unlock it in a
clean way ? I wouldn't be very happy to apply special 'CD-ROM bootable interim
hack' patches to each kernel I build for the project. Is there a way to do this
general enough so that it can go into the main kernel (maybe another config
option in /proc/sys/dev/cdrom if root should be allowed to unlock under all
conditions) ?
Thanks for your help,
Rene
