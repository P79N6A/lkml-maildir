Neat trick.  Will work for most people ... but watch out if you
have an architecture that has sparse physical address space and
can thus potentially allocate a task structure on a 16TB boundary.
At first I thought SGI Altix could be hurt by this, but they are
saved by the fact that bits [37:36] are always set to one.
I know of at least one 1TB machine now, so 16TB machines are only
a few years away.  You could stretch the life of this patch by
using PAGE_SHIFT, rather than 12 (as practically nobody builds
kernels with a 4k pagesize, especially not on monster machines).
Or perhaps just fix the allocation of task structures to skip
around the 16TB aligned ones?
