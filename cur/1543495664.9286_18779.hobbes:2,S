As long as people are thinking about this, I want to add my two cents:
- This should be configurable per-filesystem. 
(and, not completely related: )
- e2fs should "unmount" (mark clean) the filesystem say 10 minutes
(configurable) after the last write.
Why?
I have a few machines that have one disk that is actually used, and a
few disks that are just for archive storage and can be left untouched
for days at a time. If the machine suddenly crashes (device driver
development!) it'd be nice if those filesystems would come up
clean. (there is no reason against that...)
It would be nice to be able to spin down those drives after say 10 or
60 minutes of no activity. 
Regards,
		Roger.
