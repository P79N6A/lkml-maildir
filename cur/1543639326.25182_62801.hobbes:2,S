Hello,
having see that the pre1 include a big AC merge, I have tried it. For me
it's unusable:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
ICH4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev f9
PCI: Device 00:1f.1 not available because of resource collisions
ICH4: (ide_setup_pci_device:) Could not enable device.
hda: IC35L120AVVA07-0, ATA DISK drive
Any hope to include that in pre2?
Thank you very much,
	Grégoire
