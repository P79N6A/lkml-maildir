On macs files exist with no data, but only resource forks. You create
them by just writing to the resource fork. Now automagically, an
empty data-fork appears. 
Similarly the filesystem needs to recognize the "hidden hardlink"
which has to be ignored!

Now, if those resource forks were actually used for something your
friend simply has all the data. If there are resource-fork-knowledable
programs that access the resource fork as
<dirname>/.streams/myfile/resource, they will simply work. 
Of course you don't display empty resource forks. Regrettably, the
user WILL see a ".streams" directory if there are files with non-empty
resources around.

Trust me, the HFS guys have succeded in getting the filesystem
tar-able and untarable on their filesystem. You really can copy a
filesystem around that way.
You can also untar it onto ext2fs, tar it again, and untar it on HFS
and get a similar filestructure back as you started out with. Of
course, you can break things while they are on ext2. But you can
similarly break things while they are on HFS.
