Subject: [2.5.19/20] KDE panel (kicker) not starting up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The KDE panel (kicker) from KDE 3.0 (RedHat 7.3 issue) refuses to start
up. I get a SIGPIPE in DCOP, and a SIGSEGV in kicker.
This looks like something changed in regards to permissions, 'cause when I 
start KDE as root, it does work.
Does anyone know what's happening?
Regards,
Bas Vermeulen
