That didn't solve the problem, but here's the output anyway, in case 
it's of any use to you.
The output from lspci -vv (rewrapped for clarity)

The above was generated while running the 2.5.66 kernel. I've run 
several different mixers, looking for any unusual "
This morning, I compiled 2.5.68; while I'm running Rusty's latest 
modutils, I had many symbol errors when trying to compile sound support 
as modules.  With sound compiled into the kernel, the ALSA driver 
appeared to load, but none of the devices were created; when the boot 
tried to restore mixer settings, for example, it reported that the mixer 
could not be found.
Everything else on the system seems to work fine with both .66 and .68.
I have had sound working on this machine using Debian sid's stock 2.4.20 
kernel.
