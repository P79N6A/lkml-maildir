Aironet (
http://www.aironet.com/
) makes some very nice 11MBps PCMCIA
cards with fairly decent Linux drivers. One of their resellers brought
a pile of them to USENIX and loaned them out, so I got to play with
one for a while. Nice range, good latency, fairly
reliable. Unfortunately, they're very expensive. If I remember
correctly, the cards are upwards of $500, and the base stations are at
least $1000.
If you're willing to drop down to 2MBps, there's always Lucent's
WaveLan series. It's much cheaper, though not quite as nice as the
Aironet stuff. It's also supported nicely by the pcmcia-cs package.
This is all fairly off-topic, though.
