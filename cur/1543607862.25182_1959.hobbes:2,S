2.4.14-pre5		fastest for mtest01, smoothest sound.
2.4.14pre5aa1
2.4.13-ac5-freeswap	fastest for mmap001
Summary:	
mtest01
2.4.14-pre5 had the lowest wall clock time for mtest01.
2.4.14-pre5 and 2.4.14pre5aa1 played just over 80% of the 
mp3. 2.4.13-ac5-freeswap played 23% of the mp3.
mmap001
2.4.13-ac5-freeswap skipped very little and was about 11%
faster than the pre5 kernels.
