I'm curious if anyone has done any work on using multiple different 
checksums?  For example, the cost of checksumming a single block with 
multiple algorithms (sha1+md5+crc32 for a crazy example), and storing 
each checksum (instead of just one sha1 sum), may be faster than reading 
the block off of disk to compare it with the incoming block.  OTOH, 
there is still a mathematical possibility (however-more-remote) of a 
collission...
With these sorts of schemes, from basic compare-by-hash to one that 
actually checks the data for a collission, you take a hit no matter what 
when writing, but reading is still full-speed-ahead.  (if anyone is 
curious, Plan9's venti uses a multi-GB "write buffer", to mitigate the 
effect of the checksumming on throughput)
So it's easy to tweak the writing algorithms pretty much any which way, 
as long as the outcome is a unique tag for each block.  Hash collisions 
between two files, for example, could be resolved easily by making each 
unique tag "$sha1_hash $n", where $n is the unique number 
differentiating two blocks with the same SHA1 hash.
