When it oopsed it held a lock and anyone trying to get that lock will 
hang. Not sure about the new mounts, but probably the same reason.

What smbmount are you using? Does it mount anything at all?
(it shouldn't ... :)
Or is that from some earlier attempt at mounting with a different smbmount
program? You should be using smbmount from samba 2.0.7.

eax $104 = 260 = info_level, so it's in the switch ... hmm, I'm guessing
the problem is the 'p' pointer with the following reasoning from your
decoded oops:
 0:   0f b7 06          movzwl (%esi),%eax
 3:   8d 2c 30          leal   (%eax,%esi,1),%ebp
result = p + WVAL(p, 0);  /* I guess, the others match */
 6:   8b 5e 3c          movl   0x3c(%esi),%ebx
len = DVAL(p, 60);	/* 0x3c = 60 */
 9:   81 fb ff 00 00    cmpl   $0xff,%ebx
 e:   00 
 f:   76 05             jbe    16 <_XXX+0x16>
11:   bb ff 00 00 00    movl   $0xff,%ebx
if (len > 255) len = 255;
The p pointer is the rdata output from the smb_trans2_request call.
p should be pointing at a vmalloc'ed area that is SMB_INITIAL_PACKET_SIZE
sized, or possibly larger if the initial packet was replaced. The initial
size is 4000 bytes (= $0fa0).
vmalloc rounds the size to whole pages, c40481fc is 508 bytes from a page
boundary. I thought that it might have been pointing outside the
allocated memory (it still may, but it's less obvious).

smbfs in 2.2.16 does not intentionally fix any oopses AFAIK. But it's
probably quicker for you to test it than it is for me to figure out what
is wrong. And replace your smbmount too (try to find out which version you
were using).
Does it happen every time? Yes, I'm asking you to intentionally oops your
machine :) I usually umount everything I can or remount read-only, then
sync, and then try to trigger the oops. If it doesn't testing 2.2.16
doesn't mean much.
Also, if you can repeat it than I could send a patch vs 2.2.14/15/16/17pre
that adds a few printk's (first to see where the server->packet memory
starts, second to see what happens in the
	for (i = 0; i < ff_searchcount; i++)
loop in smb_proc_readdir_long).
If you can't repeat it or don't have time to test things I'll probably put
this report in my collection of bad smbfs things (not that the report was
bad) and look at it later.
Btw, 'ls -laR' is working fine here (don't have a win98, but vs win95).
The mount version message should be insignificant, the current version
only passes permission modes and uids (unless you are using a smbmount or
smbfs that is patched).
