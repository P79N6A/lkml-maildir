Right.
        movl    (%ebx), %eax    # <variable>.flags, tmp399
        andl    $48, %eax       #, tmp399
        cmpl    $48, %eax       #, tmp399
        je      .L265   #,
what's "yuck" about that?
With the single page flag:
	movl	(%ebx), %eax	#* page.521, D.21940
	testb	$32, %al	#, D.21940
	jne	.L265	#,
So you're talking about saving one sole single silly solitary instruction.

You can save that worrisome single instruction in the common case by putting the
handling of the uncommon compound pages out of line, as I indicated.
