Linux-IA64.  I sent a bunch of patches to you and Jesse that you applied
but large parts of SGI didn't for certain reasons (NIH comes to mind).
We had some discussion on linux-ia64 and on private mail on this, SGI
promised to look at the patches later.  Small parts now got in without
any attribution through Pat's patchkits but other parts are still missing
after many month of waiting.
