Well, this is of course right, but a bit strange. Because we can add
this check to any function which can't be called after exit_notify().

I think this _should_ be right, but please note that fork_idle() does
copy_process(CLONE_VM). Also, we may have some external driver which
plays with do_fork/copy_process.

Yep.

Yes. That is why wait_for_helper() does allow_signal(SIGCHLD). I think a
kernel thread must not make any assumption about ->action[SIGCHLD] if it
wants to call wait4, but we may break some "buggy" external driver.
In fact, most threads inherit action[SIGCHLD] == SIG_IGN from worker_thread().
BTW, wait_for_helper() does do_sigaction() before allow_signal(). Looks
unneeded to me.

Yes, this makes me worry too :)
