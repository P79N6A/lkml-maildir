	I don't think that in this case such would have helped.
	linux-kernel  had a subscriber whom we sent feed just fine,
	and that subscriber had  .forward  listing 40  USWEST.NET
	addresses...   Confirmation demand would have worked only
	if the harasher had been stupid enough to set the  .forward
	before subscribing him/herself...
	And frankly I don't think anyone is stupid enough to use
	their *own* .forward file to harash other people.
	Still I think we could improve things by installing e.g.
	Majordomo 2.*   However I am not MD hacker, I hack MTAs..
