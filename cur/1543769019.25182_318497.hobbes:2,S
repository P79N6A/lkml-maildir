i've done so, but..hmm...no panic was triggered, because the Oops is gone.
but it *was* there, i swear ;-)

(but this time with a tainted kernel)
now i can boot 2.6.12-rc4-mm1 (tainted/not tainted), but the oops does not
show up anymore.
but thanks for the hint, i'll keep that in mind next time [1]
Christian.

    great job!
