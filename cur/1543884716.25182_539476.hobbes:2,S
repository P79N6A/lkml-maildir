Hmm, good point.  Have to look at the code again, it has been some time 
I've written that, and it took me some time to figure how all the grant 
table stuff works ...
Maybe the add_id_to_freelist() call can simply be dropped.  The whole 
interface is released shortly thereafter, probably thats why filling the 
freelist with yunk never caused any problems ...
cheers,
