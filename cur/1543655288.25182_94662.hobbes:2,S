I have no idea :)  Find a 3D card, and test it, making sure that AGP and 
DRM are both turned on.
Also, Dave Jones did a really nice cleanup of agpgart in 2.5, so even 
though there is no agpgart MAINTAINERS entry, I think he would be a good 
target for patches :)  Even thought 2.5 agpgart is clearly different, 
davej has a clue about it and could probably ack or apply 2.4 patches...
