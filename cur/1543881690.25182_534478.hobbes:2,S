I think you are deliberately being stupid here.
You are claiming that REISER4's good speed results when using
compression actually has a simple explanation and THEREFORE all good
result for the filesystem, even those results that have nothing to do
with compression, are negated.
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.
Your conclusion is a total travesty of logic.
As I understand it, the default Reiser4 DOES NOT USE any compression at
all, not even tail compression, but saves space by eliminating block
alignment wastage (tail compression is an option).
So lets LOSE the statistics that involve compression. The results now
look like this:
.-------------------------.
| FILESYSTEM | TIME |DISK |
| TYPE       |(secs)|USAGE|
.-------------------------.
|REISER4     | 3462 | 692 |
|EXT2        | 4092 | 816 |
|JFS         | 4225 | 806 |
|EXT4        | 4408 | 816 |
|EXT3        | 4421 | 816 |
|XFS         | 4625 | 779 |
|REISER3     | 6178 | 793 |
|FAT32       |12342 | 988 |
|NTFS-3g     |10414 | 772 |
.-------------------------.
These results are still EXTREMELY GOOD for REISER4.
These results still say that Reiser4 is a truly remarkable filesystem,
as stated in:
http://linuxhelp.150m.com/resources/fs-benchmarks.htm
http://m.domaindlx.com/LinuxHelp/fs-benchmarks.htm
So why do I see an anti-Reiser religion, in all that you people say.
You, concentrate on the fact that bonnie++'s use of files that are
mainly zeroes, will make the results using compression less good than
they are.
I can't see anywhere where this has been denied.
In fact the other set of statistics that you just ignore, states that in
more realistic situations, the compression speedup is slightly negative.
What is wrong here, is:
You say that the Bonnie++ tests using compression are subject to
interpretation. No argument here.
You ignore the tests that confirm your statement. You are clearly not
interested in the actual results or their interpretation.
You, by some incredibly twisted "logic" the state that Reiser4 is
therefore not good, even though it is clearly the best filesystem when
NOT using compression.
This of course is completely deceitful "logic".
That the speed advantage from compression would be small is clear from
the OTHER data that you ignore, namely:
.-------------------------------------------------.
|File         |Disk |Copy |Copy |Tar  |Unzip| Del |
|System       |Usage|655MB|655MB|Gzip |UnTar| 2.5 |
|Type         | (MB)| (1) | (2) |655MB|655MB| Gig |
.-------------------------------------------------.
|REISER4 lzo  | 278 | 138 |  56 |  80 |  34 |  84 |
|REISER4 gzip | 213 | 148 |  68 |  83 |  48 |  70 |
|REISER4      | 692 | 148 |  55 |  67 |  25 |  56 |
|EXT4         | 816 | 174 |  70 |  74 |  42 |  50 |
.-------------------------------------------------.
