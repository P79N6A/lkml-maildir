If the kernel gets this, then udev needs to allow attributes with  
more generic paths too.  It would be nice if I could use this [Pulled  
from the sample udev output halfway down this page: http:// 
www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html#identify-sysfs].
BUS="scsi", SYSFS{../../../manufacturer}="Tekom Technologies, Inc",  
NAME="my_camera"
Frequently the attributes one wants to filter by are spread out  
through the tree, especially when they've been subdivided for clarity  
as people seem to want to do.
