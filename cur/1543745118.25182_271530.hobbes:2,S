now, doesn't seem to make a difference.. i gave IRQ 1 prio 40 and the
behaviour is the same.. BTW: what about IRQ 0? I tried at different prios
[40 and 99]. Doesn't make a difference either. As far as i understand it, it
really shouldn't make a difference either as in the interesting cases (app
woken up by irq) the scheduler is explicitly run anyways, right?
Here's another trace:
