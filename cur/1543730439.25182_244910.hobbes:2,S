To be pedantically clear about this, looking at pci_dev->irq before
calling pci_enable_device() is *guaranteed* to fail, regardless of
what the BIOS does.  So nvidia users will have to use "pci=routeirq"
until there's a new version of the nvidia driver.
Alan was specifically referring to the BAR configuration that may
be done by the BIOS.
I'm assuming your patch makes the driver call pci_enable_device()
before using either irq or BAR information.  That's the best way
to future-proof the driver.
