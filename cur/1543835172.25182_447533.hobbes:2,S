jumpy is fine though; at least on the processors my employer makes
changing frequency is really really fast, so you get maximum savings by
switching often (you can switch down more aggressively if you know
you'll switch back up quickly). So switching often is a good policy if
you want both good response AND good power savings... 
I don't know about other cpu makers; my frequency switching machines are
all Intel.
