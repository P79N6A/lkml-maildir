Why not
static inline unsigned __attribute__ ((const)) get_TR(void)
{
}
?
If TR register only ever changes during cpu_init, I don't see why you
cannot use const. Using pure would mean if you do get_TR, then store
something into global memory and do get_TR again, it will be done twice.
Also, I wonder why you don't inline it.
