Subject: ll_rw_blk.c fails to merge requests. Help!

I'm working to find this bug without success for at least 2
weeks. The problem is that under high load ll_rw_blk.c stops
to merge new requests to old ones. This causes major slowdown
of all disk operations. I put some printk to produce the
debug below which briefly show who (bu not whay) it cannot
merge blocks anymore. It happens when the queue if filled up,
but not immediately, a number of request are added/merged to
the queue as soon as data is written to the disk. At a
certain point it stop working....
Kernel is 2.4.0-test6, but I have the same problem in 2.2.16
MF means: failed to merge block xxx length yyy
REQ: got new request entry
NOREQ: failed to get new request entry and go to sleep
ADD: block xxx length yyy added (not merged) to the queue

It gets a free entry only now, but it's to late because it has already
decided to add it to the list, so the block will not be merged with
130976/4 --> now there are two contiguous non-merged requests in the queue.
And why request for block 130976 above gets a free entry immediately but
130972 has to wait so much ?  Shouldn't __get_request_wait::WAITQUEUE
ensure newly freed entries are assigned at the right order ?

Now begins a weird loop: It always gets a free entry just 1 turn later,
so it become completely unable to merge requests:
Aug 19 22:17:21 Jay kernel: MF 538160 4 
Aug 19 22:17:21 Jay kernel: NOREQ 538160 
It goes to sleep, then it gets space for 538156
Aug 19 22:17:21 Jay kernel: REQ 538156 
Aug 19 22:17:21 Jay kernel: ADD 538156 4 
Ok, added, now it needs space for 538164
Aug 19 22:17:21 Jay kernel: MF 538164 4 
Aug 19 22:17:21 Jay kernel: NOREQ 538164 
List full, go to sleep.
It gets an entry for 538160 which was requested a while before
...and so on...

As you can see all requests are added. Not a single one is merged
until I stop cat sending bytes to the file. And it takes a lot
to stop. Since the list is full, I'm unable to write anything to
the HD, so the computer is completely unusable. :((
Bye.
P.S. All requests are 4 blocks long because the hardware sector
size is 2KB.
