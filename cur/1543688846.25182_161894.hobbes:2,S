So explain this from the Sparc architecture code:
	if (flags & MAP_FIXED) {
		/* We do not accept a shared mapping if it would violate
		 * cache aliasing constraints.
		 */
		if ((flags & MAP_SHARED) && (addr & (SHMLBA - 1)))
			return -EINVAL;
		return addr;
	}
Ok, I'll explain it :)  At one time, the code did what the comment says,
but nowadays linux/mm/mmap.c doesn't call arch_get_unmapped_area() for
MAP_FIXED, so the above code is redundant and misleading.  It already
mislead me, so please remove it.  sparc and sparc64 both have it.

I can't safely set up this kind of mapping without MAP_FIXED, unless I
know SHMLBA.
This is my strategy:
	mmap MAP_ANON without MAP_FIXED to find a free area
	mmap MAP_FIXED over the anon area at same address
	mmap MAP_FIXED over the anon area at larger address
I don't see any strategy that lets me establish this kind of circular
mapping on Sparc without either (a) knowing the value of SHMLBA, or
(b) risking clobbering another thread's mmap.

Well, my code has no bug because I do run-time tests to see what
rubbish the architecture gave me.  As we see, they work :)
I don't see any real alternative to doing that.  But that's ok, it
seems robust and portable.  It's a shame about the slow cache flush,
because I can sometimes use fast cache flushing to improve my DSP
buffering algorithms.

Will msync() do it?
