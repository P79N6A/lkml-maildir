These are rh62 systems, the compiler is egcs-1.1.2. So that's not it.
I'd be willing to do the binary search through the 2.2.19pre series,
but I'd rather avoid it if it's a known bug. It's pretty painful, both
for myself and for the real users of this box, to go through the pains
of 10-20 cycles of reboot-crash-fsck_3_large_disks...
Thanks,
Ion
