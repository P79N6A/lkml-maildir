Even when they do, it's often far from what I would call "Linux
support".  I've seen vendor drivers that made such assumptions about
the machine that they would only work on IA-32 machines.  I'm talking
about things like assuming that sizof(int) == sizeof(void *) == 4, or
that physical memory addresses are the same seen from the CPU and from
the PCI bus.
