For now I've put up the 2.5 tree on bk://linuxvm.bkbits.net/linus-2.5
This thing gets mirrored automagically from Linus's home directory
on kernel.org by the script /home/riel/pushpull.sh which is run from
my crontab.
Ideally Linus would run it from his own crontab and commit the data
to bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 ;)
cheers,
Rik
