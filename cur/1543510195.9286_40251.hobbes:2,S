There is a proper standardised 66MHz variant of PCI, which is used on a lot of
Alpha, and (I think) Xeon boards. There's 64bit PCI, too, with an extra
connector for the extra lines. Most dedicated x86 users seem unaware of these.
66MHz PCI is actually somewhat troublesome. Most real 66MHz implementations seem
to have just 2 card slots per bus. That only just scrapes through the definition
of a bus. Add more slots and things get flakey.
