Please keep in mind that some people (at least me) don't like separate
build trees - I do all the "real work" in the source directory, and if I
need to go somewhere else to build, that's just a pain (and it's another
pain if, once I'm building, I have to use a different path than the one
that I'm used to in the source directory to fix something).
So I want to keep the mixed tree around (which is not to say that people 
who like the separate-object-tree thing shouldn't be _able_ to use it).
