I am truely sorry about my patch being broken by my mail program,
I have tried to fix it now and is trying to resubmit the patch.
From: Kristian Edlund <edlund@groenstue.dk>
I found a few typos, in Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt
I also changes the $PWD to `pwd` for consistency throughout the document.
