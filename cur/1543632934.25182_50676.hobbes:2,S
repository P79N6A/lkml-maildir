No, I haven't given up on it, and I admit it's fishy. However, I did it to 
ensure that no one can access the driver since it is going away as soon as 
we return to pci_unregister_driver. Though, I'll also admit that making 
the next potential user hit the BUG() in get_driver() is not the nicest 
thing to do...

There is a destructor: struct device_driver::release(). It's the last 
thing called from __remove_driver(). 
No matter what, the module will get unloaded immediately. What would be 
nice is if we could delay it until we said it was ok (from the driver's 
release callback). We could even define a common release callback for all 
drivers:
void driver_release(struct device_driver * drv)
{
	struct module * module = drv->module;
	/* do unload of module */
}
We wouldn't need a completion; we would just have to wait until the 
refcount hit 0 naturally. But, I'm just making this stuff up. Is this at 
all possible?
