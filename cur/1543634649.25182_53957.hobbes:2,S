Hi Linus,
[copy sent to Linus with inline patch]
Please can you apply the following patch to 2.5.24.
It's a complete rewrite of the LDM driver (support for Windows Dynamic
Disks).  Below is a one line summary, a full description and the patch.
LDM Driver rewritten.  More efficient.  Much smaller memory footprint.
The old driver was little more than a stopgap.
The new driver is a complete rewrite
based on a much better understanding of the database
based on much more reverse engineering
more able to spot errors and inconsistancies
it has a much smaller memory footprint
no longer considered experimental
