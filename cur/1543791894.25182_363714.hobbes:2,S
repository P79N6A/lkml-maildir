They are beginning to suspect it, so I've made sure they're still asleep.

Much as I'd hate split ptlock to enlarge struct page, I'd hate it to be
the last straw that forced you off gcc-2.9x: it does not deserve that.
But also, I just misunderstood you until now: I'd been stupidly thinking
you meant an anonymous union in place of your current u there; whereas
you meant extending the union to cover mapping, index, lru.   Hmm.
Well, if you're actively seeking a excuse to abandon gcc-2.9x?  But
although you're its best-known advocate, I think you're not alone.
Shall we wait for a more pressing reason?

I'm happy for people to use page->private again.  I thought we
ought to try out this minimal patch first, for reassurance that the
arches are not using those fields of a pagetable struct page; but that
once it's had some exposure, we'd revert the page_private mods elsewhere.
There's no point to that wrapper with the union gone, is there?
