Hello Haavard,

It is not really strange... spinlocks are mutexes on preempt-rt, and
recursive mutex locking is not allowed, this is one differences with
the mainline spinlock.
But... I tried that patch, and it works a lot better, no oopses
anymore, but I noticed that I sometimes get an input overrun (ttyS0: 1
input overrun(s) ) during stress conditions.
This is something I did not notice before, maybe it was already there,
or has something changed in this area that it is now more sensitive
for this?
Kind Regards,
Remy
