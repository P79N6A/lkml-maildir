No, sorry.  I don't really care about arguing one way or the
other.  It is more opinion than anything.  I see an I/O out to
the hard disk as something that should go to the hard disk, I see
a request to a kernel API as something the kernel should look
at.  If the kernel merely passes everything to the raw device,
why have the API in the kernel at all?
I don't need to 'win' anything here.  We can both have our
viewpoint without having to convince each other.  Nobody 'wins'
or loses really.
