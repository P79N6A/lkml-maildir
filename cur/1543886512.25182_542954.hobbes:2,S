Yeah, about twelve zillion people are hitting that and none appear to look
at the source to work out why it blew up.
I'll fast-track this:
From: Vivek Goyal <vgoyal@in.ibm.com>
o x86_64 kernel needs to be compiled for 2MB aligned addresses. Currently
  we are using BUILD_BUG_ON() to warn the user if he has not done so. But
  looks like folks are not finding message very intutive and don't open
  the respective c file to find problem source. (Bug 8439)
arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c: In function 'x86_64_start_kernel':
arch/x86_64/kernel/head64.c:70: error: size of array 'type name' is negative
o Using preprocessor directive #error to print a better message if
  CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START is not aligned to 2MB boundary.
