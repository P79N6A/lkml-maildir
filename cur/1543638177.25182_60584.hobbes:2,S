A quick read through reveals:
-		printk("mdacon: MDA card not detected.\n");
+		printk("KERN_WARNING mdacon: MDA card not detected.\n");
KERN_WARNING and friends should be outside the quotes.
Secondly, the absolutely gigantic "switch (vc_state) {" stuff with
extra layers of switch statements below it in decvte.c - I find this
rather disgusting to read.  I bet the resulting asm is also disgusting.
Isn't there a cleaner solution to this?  (I've been carrying around
since 2.2 patches to the console layer to split this up mainly because
some older versions of ARM gcc choked on it.  I'm not certain about
current versions though.)
Also, something that should probably be fixed one day, but I wouldn't
call it a show stopper:
-#define SIZE(x) (sizeof(x)/sizeof((x)[0]))
+#define SIZE(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof((x)[0]))
We have ARRAY_SIZE(x) in linux/kernel.h which does this already.
