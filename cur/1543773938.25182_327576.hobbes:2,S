[PATCH] I2C: Add support for the LPC47M15x and LPC47M192 chips to smsc47m1
This simple patch adds support for the SMSC LPC47M15x and LPC47M192
chips to the smsc47m1 hardware monitoring driver. These chips are
compatible with the other ones already supported by the driver, so I see
no reason not to support them, especially when the Linux 2.4 version of
the driver does already.
I also modified the info printks to name the chips by their real name.
