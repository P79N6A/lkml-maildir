This sounds like you installed the Vegas patch on the 
_receiver_. Correct? I'll assume so.

Reality check:
Vegas only changes the TCP sending algorithms, nothing at the
receiver side (ACK policy is not changed). So for bulk downloads at 
the receiver side it should make no difference. Did the sender in this
case run the Vegas algorithm too? Did it behave differently with
other senders not running Vegas?

If this is only on the client this sounds bogus.

Strictly it would break RFC1122 which requires VJ, but this could
probably be overcome. The problem is that Vegas has not been
extensively investigated yet on larger scale, what would happen
if millions of Linux 2.4 Vegas boxes in 2001 cause congestion 
collapse on the internet ... ? [ok, this is a worst case scenario
and not that likely, but one has to be careful: linux is not a
research OS].
I'm currently working on some ways to increase performance of
low speed/high buffering links, stay tuned.
