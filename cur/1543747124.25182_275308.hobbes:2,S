Two different issues - behaviour when no initializer is given and behaviour
when initializer does not cover everything.
IOW,
static int a1[4];		/* all zeroes, since it's non-auto */
static int a2[4] = {1,0,0,0}	/* 1 0 0 0, we have initialized them all */
static int a3[4] = {1}		/* 1 0 0 0, missing members are zeroed */
void f(void)
{
	int b1[4];		/* undefined contents */
	int b2[4] = {1,0,0,0}	/* 1 0 0 0, we have initialized them all */
	int b3[4] = {1}		/* 1 0 0 0, missing members are zeroed */
C99 6.7.8(21) and 6.7.8(10) deal with "not covers everything" and
"no initializer at all" resp.
