I am using edd to retrieve these parameters.  Unfortunately there are some
utils that I use that I cannot give it the geometry.  Those utils depend on
having the proper geometry so that the system can boot properly (no, it's
not booting linux).
I need to work around what I can't fix otherwise.  So far, the proc entry is
the only solution I have seen.
