Updated patch for 2.4.8-ac12 is available at:
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.8-ac12-netdev-random-1
and
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.8-ac12-netdev-random-2
as always, #1 adds the core support and #2 updates all network devices
to use the new flag.
2.4.9 patches are still available from the same place.
nothing new, sans the resync, since the previous patch.  i believe all
architectures and network devices are still supported.
the interested are highly encouraged to read the previous thread for a
summary of the patch and the resulting discussions.
