I've always found the term "HAL" to be vague to the point of 
meaningless.  What would it mean in this case:  "hypervisor abstraction 
layer"?  It certainly doesn't attempt abstract all hardware.

Some calls just don't need patching; an indirect call is fast enough, 
and simple.  But I can't think of a good reason to not patch patchable 
calls, other than for debugging perhaps (easier to place one breakpoint 
than one per inline site).
