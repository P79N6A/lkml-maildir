Various good points were raised. The NX bit requiring
3-level pagetables suggests that 3-level pagetables without highmem
would be valuable, at which point the unaligned splits to avoid highmem
with 3-level pagetables gain additional relevance. I'll queue that up
to be written along with split pmd affairs, and check for features
dependent on 4-level pagetables, too.

Of course. Everything is simple until it's done properly. It's
why everyone forgets the "and no simpler" half of the quote, which
turns the meaning of what everyone tries to quote on its head.
I guess looking over it I don't blame you so much. I should've been
around to clean up these issues at the time it was happening. People
seem to have been trying to use the RAM in their laptops without big
slowdowns, and may not have had the VM "sophistication" to deal with
the sorts of issues I'm raising.

This was a large portion of the substance of my complaint.
