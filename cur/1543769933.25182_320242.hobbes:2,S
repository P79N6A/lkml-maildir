[Oops: This is correct version: i send from the wrong directory earlier]
[Sorry about that spam... now i thin i know how to use quilt :-)]
This implements cpu hotplug support for X86_64. 
Modified after initial feedback from Andi.
[PS: hopefully subject is now fixed with different subject lines]
Seems to hold up for make -j, with online/offline activity.
The series of patches are split as follows:
1. initcall cleanup
	- Left __cpuinit cases as before per Andi
	- Added a few new ones, and removed couple that could stay __init
	  even with cpu hotplug.
2. Core logical online/offline of cpus
	- start with maxcpus=1, and then echo 1 to /sys/devices/system/online
	- Can also bringup all cpus and then bring up/down all but cpu0.
	- Also tested with numa=fake=2
3. Cleanup sibling map for cpu hotplug support.
4. Dont use IPI broadcast in smp_call_function() when using CPU hotplug.
   Hopefully this is some reasonable middle ground starting point.
	- Dont let a new cpu respond to IPI's. 
	- Automaticaly selected if CPU hotplus is choosen. 
	- Can also be turned on cmdline via safe_ipi=1
TBD: 
1. Track down CONFIG_SCHED_SMT Oops with both cpu up/down.
2. Test on real NUMA hw. 
Cheers,
Ashok Raj
