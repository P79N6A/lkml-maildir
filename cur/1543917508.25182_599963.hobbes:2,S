The main audience of this is new contributors, who should have more verbose 
output, including nitpicky things like multiple assignments per line.  The 
default should target them.  More advanced users can certainly use a flag 
that says "give me only the real errors".
It might be a good idea to have three levels.
--really-errors
--really-picky
--really-experimental
Only with better names.  --really-picky would be default, but would only 
include tests that have a very very high ratio of hits to false positives, 
but would still call out things like multiple assignments per line. 
--really-errors we could call the Igno level.  --really-experimental would 
call out all issues, even on checks that generate a fair number of false 
positives.
