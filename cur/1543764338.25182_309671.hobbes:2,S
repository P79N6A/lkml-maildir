I do not understamd, what is netlink multicast and how it differs from
the
existing behaviour?
Netlink message can be delivered only if someone listens for it.
Subscription part of connector is similar to existing group mechanims,
it is moved a bit higher from do_one_broadcast(),
since it is required for proper high-layer protocol and
it's users do not care about netlink groups, but only it's
own ID's, which can be different.
