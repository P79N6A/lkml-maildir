Today I realize that it's not double deprecation, it's dialectical
deprecation, for a user who gets caught between the deprecation
of ide-scsi and cdrecord targbuslun "flat" naming and then the
cdrecord error message when trying to use a full devpath. The
user's head is volleyed back and forth as cdrecord maintains
its "denial".
cdrecord whines about the full devpath in the first instance,
will not work if I use 1,0,0 in both places, but seems to
catch a clue about the devpath stub from the first instance
in order to use its 1,0,0 nomenclature below that.
#/etc/default/cdrecord
CDR_DEVICE=ATAPI:/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/generic
#ATAPI:1,0,0 won't work in CDR_DEVICE, but...
yamaha=   ATAPI:1,0,0   -1      -1      ""
I'm scared(under-informed) to drop ide-scsi since
I'm using 3ware and don't know if just scsi-generic
would be enough for that hd controller(needs ide-scsi?
3ware's site doc is not easy to find).
