Hi Gabriel!
It looks like initrd.gz could not be mounted. The unknown-block(1,0)
is /dev/ram0 (and has normally initrd attached to it) as specified on
kernel command line.
Do you use an initrd or an initramfs? Is the kernel compiled with initrd
support? Is the ramdisk size big enough to hold your initrd?
