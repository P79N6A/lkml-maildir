Uhm...32 bits will cover 4 billion users.  Still, considering the trend
toward ISP mergers, and the trend toward everyone getting online, it might
be a good idea to allow everyone on the planet to have a unique uid, and
so going past 32 bits could be a good idea.
How many problems would be introduced by making them both 128 bits and
using the UUID algorithm to generate uids and gids?
