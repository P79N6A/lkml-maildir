I downloaded your patch, and I have 2 questions:
+              movl %%eax,%%cr4; \
+ movl %%cr3,%%ebx; \
+ movl %%ebx,%%cr3; \
+ movl %%ecx,%%cr4; \
+ " : : : "cc", "eax", "ebx", "ecx", "memory" \
+    ); \
IIRC I read somewhere that you should reload cr3 after changing cr4.
Unfortunately, I can't find that text, but arch/i386/kernel/head.S contains
these comments:
>       movl %cr4,%eax          # Turn on 4Mb pages
>        orl $16,%eax
>        movl %eax,%cr4
>        movl %cr3,%eax          # Intel specification clarification says
>        movl %eax,%cr3          # to do this. Maybe it makes a difference.
>                                # Who knows ?
In my own patch, I added an additional "movl %%ebx,cr3" after reenableing
PGE. Do you have that specification clarification?

I guess flush_all_zero_pkmaps() will happen quite often, it might be the
most common caller of flush_tlb_all() [other reasons are module load/unload,
or creating a process that uses more than 1024 file handles - extremely rare
events] . I would remove the PAGE_GLOBAL bit from the kmap pages, then we do
not need another flush_tlb function that's referenced from the
cross-platform part of the kernel.
