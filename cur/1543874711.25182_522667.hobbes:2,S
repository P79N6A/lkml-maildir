Oh yes it helps, it works nicely, on X and on the console with gpm.
Most probably psmouse is built-in on the kernel because I have no
module with that name and if I check on the, what I suppose was the
build .config kernel file, I can see the following:
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
 CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
 Do you want me to check something else?
Don't bother to Cc me directly anymore, I have subscribe to the
mailing list with another e-mail address to avoid problems. Some
domain migration issues, sorry for the inconveniency. Regards,
