Instead of turning the apic off in bios like I'm doing, either smp code 
or today's patch to turn apic off before on might do it for you. I have 
to do something with apic to get my pci netcard to work and not get "irq 
disabled". pci=noacpi wasn't it for me. Turning apic off in bios or 
using smp code on uniprocessor is not all, I disable everything to get 
errors and lockups to stop. Power management works. UDMA6 and irq 
unmasking and ide options work.

If I turn off parallel and serial ports and usb as well, and remove cd drives, I don't get lockups or see netdev watchdog failure to transmit and disable irq7 along with netcard failure. Needless to say the onboard ethernet controller and audio don't work. But I have another reliable textmode file server with an MSI nforce2 board. There are a few "correctable errors" trapped with slightly underclocked overtested csl2 pc3200 ram running at 2 channel 166 = 333. Altogether a very fine agp8 textmode linux box. Ecstatically, I can copy and paste script text with a mouse, but of course it's on a ps2 port, not usb. USB code, when not logging errors, doesn't recognize usb mouse or keyboard either booted or hot-plugged. I can hibernate with textmode agp8, writing scripts, while somebody hacks nforce2 and nvidia geforce 4200ti--no, I will not dump 2.6 for a 2.4 kernel patched with nvidia driver--more important things don't work in 2.4 than 2.6! 6-channel surround silence and frozen pizza...with the cd's pulled out md might not lockup when copies overflow the drive buffer cache!
