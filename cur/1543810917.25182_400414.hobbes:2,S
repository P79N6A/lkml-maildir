this is probably a mixed blessing; right now frequent and non-frequent 
code are highly intermixed, so even in the current situation the icache 
isn't optimally used.
So what you sort of want is a thing better than pure "sort", a sort that 
keeps existing order *within the hot functions*, but move the "cold" 
ones out. That is thankfully independent of the infrastructure; I'll 
keep that in mind when making the next version of the order list, it's a 
good idea.
