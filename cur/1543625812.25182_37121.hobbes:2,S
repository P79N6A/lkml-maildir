No, the sentence, "The problem is when the module is already loaded..."
/sbin/hotplug gets called when the network device is started up, it
doesn't only get called before the module is loaded.

No, but it solves the problem, "only 8 devices max", and "what to do
when a card is removed and then plugged back in."  Both seems like good
things to fix in the driver :)
