Those are the only ones I know
Buslogic cards and AHA174x cards both emulate an aha1542 but have a native
driver. The 174x has a buggy emulation that can cause corruption.
The megaraid and scsi then i2o one comes about because some cards are both 
scsi native and i2o interfaced and scsi native is the preferred API in all
current cases.
