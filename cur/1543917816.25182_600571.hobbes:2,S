Not really.  Ordinarily one could move hpet-force-enable-on-ich34.patch to
start-of-series, then verify that mainline+hpet-force-enable-on-ich34.patch
works correctly, then just bisect all the other patches.
But tht doesn't work because hpet-force-enable-on-ich34.patch has a
dependency on other patches in the hrt-related patch series, and it could
be that the bug which you've exposed is already in mainline anyway.
If you had a minimal, standalone hpet-force-enable-on-ich34.patch against
mainline then you could test that against mainline.  If that also failed
then you could git-bisect mainline, applying
hpet-force-enable-on-ich34.patch each time (I've done that before).  But
this assumes that you're searching for a regression in minaline.  It may
never have worked.
