We probably need a quirk class for resume in this situation. The kind of
things that worry me if we are not doing the quirk handling, and what I
suspect happened in the case I looked at are that chipset bug
workarounds did not get restored, and in this case the older VIA chipset
involved then corrupted DMA streams and trashed the users disk.

Some are yes, but not others.
