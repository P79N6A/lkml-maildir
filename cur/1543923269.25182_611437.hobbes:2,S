This same sort of problem was just fixed for iwl4965.  The fix for that
was to disable device interrupts until everything the driver needed
(including interrupt handler) was set up and ready before re-enabling
them, I think.  See the thread "iwl4965 detection problem" and the mail
from Jes Sorensen on 2007-10-26.
The orinoco_plx driver appears to enable interrupts (in
orinoco_plx_hw_init()) after calling request_irq, but there's an
interesting comment in ..._hw_init():
	/* bjoern: We need to tell the card to enable interrupts, in
	   case the serial eprom didn't do this already.  See the
	   PLX9052 data book, p8-1 and 8-24 for reference. */
Perhaps your card's EPROM tells the card to enable interrupts too early?
Not sure how to fix that though.
