That is exactly why we need a page flag.  If you have a better
name for the page flag, please let me know.
Note that the kind of page needs to be separate from PageLRU,
since pages are taken off of and put back onto LRUs all the
time.

Every anonymous, tmpfs or shared memory segment page is potentially
swap backed. That is the whole point of the PG_swapbacked flag.
A page from a filesystem like ext3 or NFS cannot suddenly turn into
a swap backed page.  This page "nature" is not changed during the
lifetime of a page.
