cool! With the debugging code removed it doesnt look all that complex.  
Do you think i can attempt to plug this into the -RT tree, or should i 
wait some more? (One observation: if you know some branch is slowpath in 
a common codepath then it's useful to mark the condition via unlikely().  
That results in better code layout and is also a guidance for the casual 
reader of the code.)
