Heh.. don't I wish!
The best is still as described originally:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/6/170
Basically, "cat" a ton of huge files together into a single new one,
and then watch /proc/meminfo to see what happens.  For me, the count
there still just hangs at some big number like 500MB until I type "sync",
at which point it (nearly) instantly now goes to zero.
Previous to this patch, the "sync" actually resulted in a ton of disk writes,
but now those happen on the tail end of the "cat" command, as they should.
