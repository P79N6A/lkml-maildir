Subject: [PATCH 18/39] NLKD/x86-64 - INT1/INT3 handling changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/9/106

This
- switches the INT3 handler to run on an IST stack (to cope with
  breakpoints set by a kernel debugger on places where the kernel's
  %gs base hasn't been set up, yet); the IST stack used is shared with
  the INT1 handler's
- allows nesting of INT1/INT3 handlers so that one can, with a kernel
  debugger, debug (at least) the user-mode portions of the INT1/INT3
  handling; the nesting isn't actively enabled here since a kernel-
  debugger-free kernel doesn't need it
