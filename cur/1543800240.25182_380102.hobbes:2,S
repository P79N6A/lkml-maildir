I do not have that kernel or configuration any longer,
so I cannot look those addresses up.
I recreated a similar kernel, did similar experiments, got
similar traces, looked up the new addresses.
The one in the "<idle>-0" trace is "cpu_idle".
The others I got were mostly related to the load on the system,
all over the kernel:
Floating point emulator (call_fpe, float64_to_float32, ...),
jffs2 (deflate_fast, ...), console write (several places within
sa1100_console_write).
The strange ones in my new experiments were "mcount" and
"notify_die".
Do you need more of them?
