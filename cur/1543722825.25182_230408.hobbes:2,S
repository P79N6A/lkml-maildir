When I say compatible, I mean the the filesystem need not be formatted. All you need to do patch the kernel, and re-coompile the module/kernel, and remove the old module and insert the new one (if you are using ext3 as a module). 
Currently there is a function in ext3_max_size() which limits the file size to 2TB because of the number of blocks, namely i_blocks.

With an unpatched version you would not be able to create a file greater than 2TB at all and considers that all files are below 2TB.

Andreas has proposed a few fields but I want to make sure that those fields as well are not used.

Once approved, it can be used for ext2 as well. Converting the current patch for ext2 would be childs play. ext2 and ext3 use almost the same structures (actually from my point of view, exactly the same but am afraid to use the word "exactly").
