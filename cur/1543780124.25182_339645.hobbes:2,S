We didn't use to export handle_mm_fault before, and it wasn't an inline 
function in 2.6.12 either. 
And no modules I know of call handle_mm_fault(). What module causes 
problems? That's very much a kernel internal function.
IOW, there's something wrong in your setup. It can't have worked on 2.6.12 
either, 
The only thing that has ever exported it afaik is
	arch/ppc/kernel/ppc_ksyms.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(handle_mm_fault); /* For MOL */
and that looks pretty suspicious too (what is MOL, and regardless, 
shouldn't it be an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL?).
