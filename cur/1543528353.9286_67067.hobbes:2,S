Hi,
Please correct me if I am wrong :)
Looking at some of the source, I see there are a few ways to get access to 
HIGH memory in the Linux kernel.
1) We can steal an entry in some page directory and install a temporary 
translation
2) The APIC code uses fix_to_virt
Should there be a consistent API to do these kind of things?  For example, 
we will need to read high memory for MPS tables, ACPI tables too (not just 
IOAPIC registers)... maybe if we had a consistent API for all of this, it 
would make it cleaner... or is this already there?  Is this what kmap (or 
io_remap) is supposed to do?
Best Wishes,
Lyle
