Considering your /proc/meminfo under load:

I actually suspect you should be _fairly_ close to such a situation 
already. In particular, the Active and Inactive lists really are fairly 
small, and don't contain the big SHM area, they seem to be just the cache 
and some (a fairly small amount of) anonymous pages.
The above actually confuses me mightily. I _really_ expected the SHM pages 
to show up on the active/inactive lists if it was actually SHM, and they 
don't seem to. What am I missing?
Louis, exactly how do you allocate that big 1.6GB shared area?
