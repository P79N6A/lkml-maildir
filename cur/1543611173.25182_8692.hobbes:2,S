Release 1.0.10 of JFS was made available today.
Drop 48 on November 28, 2001 (jfs-2.4-1.0.10-patch.tar.gz
and jfsutils-1.0.10.tar.gz) includes fixes to the file system
and utilities.
Function and Fixes in release 1.0.10
- fsck shouldn't endian swap dtree struct twice
- Christoph Hellwig: put inodes later on hash queues
- Fix boundary case in xtTruncate
- When invalidating metadata, try to flush the dirty buffers
  rather than sync them.
- Add another sanity check to avoid trapping when imap is corrupt
- Fix file truncate while removing large file (assert(cmp == 0))
- read_cache_page returns ERR_PTR, not NULL on error
- Add dtSearchNode and dtRelocate
- Christoph Hellwig: JFS needs to use generic_file_open &
  generic_file_llseek
- Remove lazyQwait, etc. It created an unnecessary bottleneck in TxBegin.
