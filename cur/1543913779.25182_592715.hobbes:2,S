CPU can cache the value all right, but it cannot use that cached value
*forever*, it has to react to invalidate cycles on the shared bus
and re-fetch new data.
IOW: atomic_read(&x) which compiles down to memory accessor
will work properly.

Yes, but "arbitrarily large amount of time" is actually measured
in nanoseconds here. Let's say 1000ns max for hundreds of CPUs?

Yes, but 
1. CPU shouldn't overheat (in a sense that it gets damaged),
   it will only use more power than needed.
2. cpu_relax() just throttles down my CPU, so it's performance
   optimization only. Wait, it isn't, it's a barrier too.
   Wow, "cpu_relax" is a barrier? How am I supposed to know
   that without reading lkml flamewars and/or header files?
Let's try reading headers. asm-x86_64/processor.h:
#define cpu_relax()   rep_nop()
So, is it a barrier? No clue yet.
/* REP NOP (PAUSE) is a good thing to insert into busy-wait loops. */
static inline void rep_nop(void)
{
        __asm__ __volatile__("rep;nop": : :"memory");
}
Comment explicitly says that it is "a good thing" (doesn't say
that it is mandatory) and says NOTHING about barriers!
Barrier-ness is not mentioned and is hidden in "memory" clobber.
Do you think it's obvious enough for average driver writer?
I think not, especially that it's unlikely for him to even start
suspecting that it is a memory barrier based on the "cpu_relax"
name.

You are basically trying to educate me how to use atomic properly.
You don't need to do it, as I am (currently) not a driver author.
I am saying that people who are already using atomic_read()
(and who unfortunately did not read your explanation above)
will still sometimes use atomic_read() as a way to read atomic value
*from memory*, and will create nasty heisenbugs for you to debug.
