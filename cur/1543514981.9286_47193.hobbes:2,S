It looks like an AIX server bug and has been repeatedly reported to IBM. If you
have any kind of maintenance contract with IBM please file a bug report
against it. Since its file corruption mark the priority right up and scream
at people.

Yes

Solaris did, but unlike IBM they fixed it quite a while back and made
patches available on SunSolve. IBM appear to use the Sun code but without
the fixes. (at least the traces are so similar from Sun and IBM it sure
looks the same code base).

It will happen with 2.2.5 as well. It seems to be partly timing related.
