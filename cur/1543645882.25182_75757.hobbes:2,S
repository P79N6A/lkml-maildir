Right, but cap_get_proc calls _libcap_cappid with pid of 0.  At any
rate, I believe pid == 0 is intentional to pick up the current
capabilities.

I tried on various older 2.5 kernels (> 2.5.20) and they returned -ESRCH.
I agree, the PID hashing probably started picking up swapper.  And yes
the tabbing is odd.  The file is badly in need of Lindent, as it's mostly
space tabbed.  I didn't want to hide the patch in whitespace changes ;-)
thanks,
