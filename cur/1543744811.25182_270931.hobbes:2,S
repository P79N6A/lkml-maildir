Hi Jan,
thanks you for you response, unfortunatly it appears not to work better :/
I think the problem is isolated, I notices that System.map doesnt
contain same information for my function:
there is the line "c010d480 T myFunction"
but no entry: __ksymtab_myFunction nor __kstrtab_myFunction, 
A warning appear during kernel compilation, on the line: 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(myFunction):
warning: type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'EXPORT_SYMBOL'
parameter names (without types) in function declaration
data definition has no type of storage classe
seems to me really weird :/
