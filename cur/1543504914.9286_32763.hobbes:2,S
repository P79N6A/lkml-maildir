(a) the NFSv2 spec only talks about other clients -- it doesn't say
anything about concurrent writes that _aren't_ from NFSv2 clients.
So maybe ordinary write() calls don't need to lock anything at all.
(b) NFSv3 doesn't have this as a requirement AFAICT.  So I should think
there are no NFS apps depending on this behaviour.
(c) If atomic writes can be done by knfsd, I think there should be a
mechanism to do them from user space too -- not every file server lives
in the kernel, not even every NFS server.
