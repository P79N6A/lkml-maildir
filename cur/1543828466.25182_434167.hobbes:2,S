Yep, mea culpa.

How strongly do you feel about reporting stat.st_blksize out to be the
clustersize?  Keeping in mind that if you report a value which is too
big, /bin/cp will start coredumping....
If I take Christoph's suggestion of simply removing sb->s_blksize
altogether, and forcing filesystems that want to return a non-default
value for stat.st_blksize to supply their own filesystem-specific
getattr, will you mind terribly?
