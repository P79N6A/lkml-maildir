HI,
I have a system that works well with the default kernel 2.036 from
Redhat..But then I decided to upgarde to 2.2.10..it compiled well and as
usual I edited lilo.conf and tried to boot with the new kernel ...But I
get the following error mesg::
VFS: Cannot open root device 08:01
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:01
Pls email me separately as I am not subscribed to the list..
Thx,
Arni
