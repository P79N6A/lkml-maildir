neat!

We win in increment_head/increment_tail:
static void increment_head(struct oprofile_cpu_buffer * b)
{
unsigned long new_head = b->head_pos + 1;
	wmb();
- 
if (new_head < (b->buffer_size))
	b->head_pos = new_head;
- 
else
- 
	b->head_pos = 0;
+ 
b->head_pos++;
}
for this added cost when accessing the buffer:
b->buffer[b->head & b->buffer_size_mask];
Modulo use is not worth but with buffer_size a power of 2
it's probably a win, I'll try and measure this later, not
urgent since the problem is fixed, I added it in our todo.
regards,
Phil
