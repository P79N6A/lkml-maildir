I have no idea.  Somewhere in the depths of the Red Hat networking
scripts.  There's multiple of them calling multiple other programs
and it's impossible to debug what's going on.  All I know is that
IPv6 doesn't get configured if fd0,1,2 are closed, but does if they're
open.
It could be a script, or some other program.  There's no way to tell.

I'm redirecting them in the /sbin/hotplug script to something sane,
but I think the kernel itself should be directing these three fd's
to somewhere whenever it invokes any user program, even if it is
/dev/null.
I think Alan disagrees with me, but I think the history that these
types of problems _keep_ cropping up over and over is proof enough
that it's necessary for sane userspace.
(Another example which is happening _now_: having /sbin/init die over
 a suspend/resume cycle because you have no system console on your
 embedded device isn't nice.)
