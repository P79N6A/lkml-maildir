All I'm saying is that. Unregistration is effectively complete at the time
we call schedule(). At this point only, so to speak, buggy subsystems are
holding references. Adding new devices and routes won't hurt. Even if
it will only those buggy guys might have problems with that.

I'm not following you. How dropping rtnl_lock while calling schedule() 
would affect
our bug hunting :) ?
We still emit "waiting for ..." warning message and we still don't give 
control
to the driver unless refcount is 0.

There is no deadlock here.
