Dear all,
I am doing some testing of packets flowing.
In the kernel program. what function should I type so that I can
get time of the packets start time and last recieved time.
I was thinking of using those "gettimeofday" functions..
what is those funcitons called in Linux System??
which libraries should I include to support the time functions??
and I am thinking of printing out the those times as well for analysis using 
printk. However I have so many other debugging messages as well.
They are using printk as well. I would like to ask how can I separate
out the debugging messages, the time messages one files, say, 
/var/log/time.. and the other /var/log/other??
Thanks a lot in advance
Eric
