What if this was handled by the kernel not sending hotplug messages until it
had been told that the system was ready to load drivers etc.
init.d/hotplug tells the kernel that userspace is ready to hear about hotplug
events, and the kernel kicks off by telling /sbin/hotplug about the devices
that are already in the system at startup.
It should probably be a priority or bitmask, rather than a simple on/off
switch, so that the diethotplug in initramfs can be told about the devices
needed for booting (but the TV tuner can wait until the heavyweight hotplug
is around).
...or have I totally misunderstood the coldplug problem?
