Often the problem bridges contain such devices, and are surrounded by
them as well, so moving them isn't really all that safe.
Here's another datapoint I found today:
(numbers represent resources).
-+-[host 05]
 +-[ide 08]
 +-[usb 04]
 +-[vga 03]
 +-[audio 02]
 +-[pci bridge 02-06]
   +-[ethernet 07]
   +-[device in slot 01]
The bridge is setup completely wrong, and appears to be entirely transparent
regardless of the resource ranges programmed into it.  X was complaining about
the vga device having an invalid I/O resource (since it was a resource which
is supposedly behind the bridge).  And the devices behind the bridge were
working just fine even with resource allocations outside the range of the
bridge.  Using setpci to edit the bridge configuration made X stop being
concerned about the resources.
