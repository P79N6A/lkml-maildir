Okay:
There were some bk scsi changes that ignored the queue depth (qlogicisp
sets them all to one). 
Current bk (I just pulled and checked) has a fix, the cleaner shinier 
better scsi_lib.c scsi_request_fn now has this code:
	if (sdev->device_busy >= sdev->queue_depth)
		break;
So the oops has to do with the isp handling multiple requests in a row or
in quick succession.
Hopefully going to the latest bk will fix your oops.
