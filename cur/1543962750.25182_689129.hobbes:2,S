I understand what you are saying.
The problem is that with A=m, C=y built-in code enabled by C cannot 
access the code enabled by A which can result in a build error.

I know I'm bad at the syntax when I'm not trying stuff myself.
	depends on !B || !X86
is the same and should be the correct syntax.
Or make it just
	depends on !B
The problem is not the syntax, the problem is whether C should be 
visible, and what happens if the user enables it.

My point is that all this "select follows depenencies" is easily said, 
but doing it in a way that it's better than what we have today is 
nontrivial.
I'm not even sure whether the best solution might be to do it manually 
like we are doing with SSB_POSSIBLE, but if I'd start to convert stuff 
to that I'm sure many maintainers will say "no, kconfig is broken" and 
even reject patches.
If you think I'm wrong implement your suggestion and then handle all the 
cornercases. It might or might not work. I'm just saying that it isn't 
an easy problem.
