How is the statement, "If you don't trust the intelligence of the Linux
kernel developers, then don't use the Linux kernel." a monopolistic
tone?
I'm serious, I never want to force anyone to use Linux.  I want to make
Linux be so good that everyone wants to use it, out of their own free
will.  And if they disagree with the way Linux is developed, or the
license terms, or the way it works, it will not bother me at all if they
choose to use something else.
I hear OpenSolaris is looking for users :)
thanks,
