Yes that is odd.

Even masked we still won't see the EOI, because then we are in i8259
mode.  So masked versus totally cleared really should make no
difference.

Possibly.  If we were to change the order probably.

I haven't looked.  My guess is that in the normal case it doesn't matter
because no irqs are alive and the kexec on panic case just copied that.
I guess right now I can see work put into cleaning things up a little
or not having to call disable_IO_APIC() at all.  that was supposed
to be a short term hack, until we fixed things properly.
So far no one has been brave enough to mess with the kernel apic
initialization order so we can remove disable_IO_APIC.  If our
goal isn't to fix things properly by removing the need for
disable_IO_APIC I don't feel like putting much effort into this
code path.
