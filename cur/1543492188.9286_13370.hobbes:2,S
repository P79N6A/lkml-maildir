I have just upgraded two servers to 2.2.5 and nfs server2.2beta40. I did
the kernels identical. The one that is causing problems has a process
(rpciod) running from kernel space, the only option i add for nfs was
filesystem support. also rpc.nfsd just refuses to start, rpc.portmap and
rpc.mountd run just fine. I appreciate any help! If more info is needed
let me know!
