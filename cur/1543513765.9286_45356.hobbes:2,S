If either of those are correct, then the MCdialog file won't get
created either.
I have an idea how this could be fixed for the case where /tmp is a
different partition to . and, at least in my opinion, a system with
/tmp either read-only or full is asking for trouble...
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
