Optimisation against potential race (see below) ?

IMO, the code will still hang because, the list_for_each_entry_safe() 
loop will never complete, even with the new scheme. Indeed, the loop 
call __rpc_wake_up_task() will try to set RPC_TASK_WAKEUP bit, but it is 
already set by rpc_wake_up_task(), so it hangs...
A: run rpc_wake_up_task(task foo)
A: set RPC_TASK_WAKEUP bit
--interrupt--
B: run rpc_wake_up()
B: grab queue->lock
B: enter the list_for_each_entry_safe() loop
B: run __rpc_wake_up_task(task foo)
B: wait for RPC_TASK_WAKEUP bit
A: wait for queue->lock
  -> deadlock ?
