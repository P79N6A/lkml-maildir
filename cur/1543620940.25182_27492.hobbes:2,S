Still not working, but thanks for the info anyway. Tried with 1,2 and a
couple of megs down from the physical memory from meminfo, but still no
dice. Afaik, i remember something about the memory of the graphics and
audio being shared, and since X cuts in first, it gobbles the memory up.
Not sure about that one as it still doesn't work if i run init3 and kill
X.
