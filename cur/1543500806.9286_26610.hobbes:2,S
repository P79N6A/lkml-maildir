For some reason, my mouse isn't working completely in 2.2.5-15 anymore. 
Specifically, the mouse wheel is no longer recognized.  When using
2.0.36, the wheel worked fine.  However, in 2.2.5, it doesn't work
anymore.  Even if I just type "cat /dev/mouse" I get garbage, of course,
if I move the mouse, but the wheel doesn't do a thing.  In 2.0.36 it
responded just fine.  I'm using the Cordless Wheel Mouse from Logitech. 
A friend of mine uses a Logitech as well (not the cordless) and the
2.2.5 kernel works fine for him.
Any suggestions?
