IIRC, NTFS has the capability to store a posix uid and gid, but it is 
never actually used.  There is no good way to get NT to understand 
mappings to linux uid/gids, so the information it puts there is 
useless.  As a result, the Linux NTFS driver just makes all files owned 
by a fixed id you can specify at mount time, or defaults to root.
