I'm going to speak from experience:
My mother, who is the biggest windoze fan on the face of the universe, got
fed up with win98 and decided to move to win2k. The hole "multi-user" thing
doesn't bother her in the slightest. She has a non-admin account for
herself "karen".
You want a better example?
My little cousin is not much into computers but he uses one enough to check
mail, surf the web etc... Like many win98 users he was re-installing it
about once a month. He finally got so fed up he asked me to install Linux
for him!
He is now very happy. He doesn't care about the fact that he has to type
in his user name. He even doesn't know any shell commands. He would
probably actually get concerned if he had to use root always because that
would reveal the same problems that he was having with win98.
There's a lot of things you can do to make Linux easier for newbies. None
of them involve hacking the kernel. Have you tried Linux-Mandrake 8.0 yet?
