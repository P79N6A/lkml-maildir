argh.
That felt good - let's do it again.
argh.
It is *not* a global instruction.  It uses setenv, so the user's policy
affects only the target process and its forked children.

That's true.
Although if the user knows that he'll want to use that data again soon, and
he elects to purge it all from cache beforehand then we're dealing with a pretty
dumb user.
If this user doesn't plan to use the data again, but some other user does,
then he loses.

That is the aim and effect of this work.

yup.  It's those odd cases where it goes wrong which I'm addressing here.
And of course there's no way for the kernel to work out that it's about to
go wrong - kernel can't read user's mind.
Well.  That's not strictly true.  One could envisage a database-backed
learning program which observes the users work patterns and, based on
various pattern-matchings, works out what the best strategy is likely to be
when the user starts some operation which he has performed previously.
