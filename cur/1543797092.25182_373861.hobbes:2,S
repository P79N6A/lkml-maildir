atomic_add_unless is sort of a special case.  It doesn't have a clean 
simple implementation, unlike most of the other atomic_t operations.  If 
an equivalent result could be obtained using, e.g., atomic_inc_and_test, 
that would be a better approach.
On the other hand, Oliver needs to be careful about claiming too much.  In 
general atomic_t operations _are_ superior to the spinlock approach.  If 
they weren't, atomic_t wouldn't belong in the kernel at all.
