Understandable. Especially when memory fragments after some uptime.
But of course it doesn't help much in practice because all the interesting
block devices support DAC anyways and the IOMMU is disabled for that.
Also it's likely cheaper just submit more segments than to have the IOMMU
overhead
(at least for sane devices, if not it may be worth to artificially limit the
dma mask of the device to force IOMMU on IA64 and x86-64)
