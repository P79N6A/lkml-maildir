 Hmm, no objection in principle, but calling printk() for a string that
does not end with a trailing '\n' leads to log being messed up if another
message is placed from elsewhere inbetween.  Using sprintf() to construct
the message may be an unnecessary complication, though.  Perhaps it would
be reasonable to report a single bit per line.  What do you think?
 Anyway, please note that such decoding used to be there, but it was
removed in 2.4.0-test7 for being too verbose, IIRC. ;-)  For me either way
is alike, though.
