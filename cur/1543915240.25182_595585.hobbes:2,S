I would as well :) But I don't know the locking code good enough to
start fixing. Besides, even if I send a patch series that handles this,
I don't think that anyone will accept it, due to "this changes too much
code", "can you prove you fixed all the places" and so on...

Well, there's a long standing BUG in leases code - when we made all the
checks in inserting lease, we call the locks_alloc_lock() and may fall
asleep. Bu after the wakeup nobody re-checks for the things to change.
I suspect there are other bad places.
