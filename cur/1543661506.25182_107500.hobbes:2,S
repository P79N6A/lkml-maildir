Unfortunately, these functions won't work "as is" on all architectures.
Even if the IO port space is mapped somewhere in the CPU memory space,
this doesn't mean that the mapping is linear - look at parisc inX/outX
functions, for example.
In other words, you cannot portably use readX/writeX instead of inX/outX.
