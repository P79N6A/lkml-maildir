That is a clearly bogus argument.  (In fact it looks like a stack address,
a common thing to be found in uninitialized variables.)  Unless you have
some reason to suspect that this is not the argument actually passed by
make, then you should look at make and see why it passed the bogus
argument.  So far, I still don't see a direct suggestion of a kernel bug
here.  
Thanks,
Roland
