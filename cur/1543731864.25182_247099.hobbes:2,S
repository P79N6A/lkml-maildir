since the message was right during detection it was indication of deeper
trouble - and indeed it was caused by the IRQ1 thread being starved by
init and thus the handler not running at all - the 'spurious ACK' was a
weird (and probably buggy) way of the PS2 layer telling that the
expected IRQ never arrived ...
in any case, this was a bug in the hardirq redirection code.
