Well, yes, of course, the x86 version works just fine, because x86-64 is
backward compatible.
The benefits won't be huge:
	a marginal speed increase due to more registers
	no need for 32-bit libs on the system and in memory
	enough address space for bk, should it ever need more
	a general feeling of doing things right ;)
