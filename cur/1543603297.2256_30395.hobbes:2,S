I'm running 2.4.10-ac3+preempt on a K6-3/366 with 128MB RAM.
I tried to open the file flag.pdf in ghostview 
-rw-r--r--   1 brian    console    229365 Oct  1 22:49 flag.pdf
The system became almost completely unresponsive.  The mouse would
move every 20 seconds or so.   The hard drive indicator on the laptop
was basically on the whole time, and I could hear the drive
making noise.
The computer was working just had become nearly unresponsive just
occasionally moving the mouse pointer every 20 seconds or so.
I ctrl-alt-bs'd the X session and eventually the X session came down and
everything returned to normal as far as responsiveness is concerned.
Just brought X back up and continued as normal.
The behavior is repeatable.  And the same thing happens if I try to
open the flag.pdf file in gimp.
I suppose if I waited long enough both gimp and ghostview would
eventually come up.
However, I'm sure the system isn't meant to grind to a halt while
bringing up that file.
