But this is not the checks - just a flag, MAP_EXECUTABLE, which
may mean that the exec perms are required.
Currently there is no way for the program to express that
explicitly (if only by the use of the mprotect call), so
why not to add one?

Since PROT_EXEC doesn't require an exec perm on file, I don't
see why "noexec" should be special.

At least without selinux - yes, so my question was why to
even add the hacks.
