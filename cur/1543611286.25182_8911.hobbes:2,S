I've encountered the same problem, with the same hardware setup (I
believe it's a Dell 2400, or something like that), on 2.4.14+xfs.  For
me it didn't lock up the entire machine however, it only seemed to
kill the network - I was able to reboot the machine cleanly once I got
to the console. (message from yesterday with the subject 'failed
assertion in tcp.c')  I too, am open to suggestions :-)
