	OK, I'll try it soon, I assume you ack about the
new fib_select_multipath scheduler discussed in this thread.

	Yep, I'm wondering, nobody complains about this problem :)
May be it is still not too late to fix it :)

	I see, very good, you restore the nh_dev on "enable IP"
which is detroyed on "disable IP".
About medium_id, I didn't tested your variant but I see what you mean:
proxy_arp must be enabled for the receiver, distinguish 0/-1.
Sounds good, looks good, only doc changes:
- change "media" to "medium"
- docs in Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt or the net part
is going out from this file?
	About the FIB changes, check fib_sync_down because I see a
bad scenario, i.e. change:
if (force && nh->nh_dev) {
to
if (force && nh->nh_dev == dev && nh->nh_flags&RTNH_F_DEAD) {
and move it before endfor_nexthops because we can miss the
following sequence of events:
- enable IP
- link up
...
- link down => nh is DEAD after force=0 but with valid nh_dev!=NULL
and we come here with the new change:
- disable IP/unreg with force=1 => we miss the above event and
don't clear nh_dev
In short, nh can be already DEAD with nh_dev!=NULL and we miss it when
force is 1.
So, the new code must be something like this:
				}
+				if (force && nh->nh_dev == dev &&
+				    nh->nh_flags&RTNH_F_DEAD) {
+					dev_put(nh->nh_dev);
+					nh->nh_dev = NULL;
+				}
			} endfor_nexthops(fi)
	There is a second variant: we to keep all DEAD nhs to be with
nh_dev==NULL but I'm not sure about it. At least, you already added
a mechanism the nexthops to bind again to outdev and this can work,
may be. But I prefer the first solution after fixing.
