2.4.20-ac2 panics at the end of running initscripts
/var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog are corrupted
(looks like a file list, but random unprintable 
characters garbage in between each filename).
Due to the corruption of the logs I'm not too keen
on playing with it much to figure out what it's doing.
