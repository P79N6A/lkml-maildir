Whoops, if I divide inputnum and inputden by gcd I don't need to pass  
by reference.
The trivial implementation of euclid (modulo the bogus address-of  
operations above) is of course something like this:
unsigned long euclid(unsigned long a, unsigned long b)
{
	unsigned long q, r;
	if (!a || !b)
		return 1;
	do {
		q = a / b;
		r = a % b;
		a = b;
		b = r;
	} while (r);
	return a;
}
