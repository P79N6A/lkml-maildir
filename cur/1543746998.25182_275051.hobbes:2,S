Hmm. I agree with Manfred.  hardirq_count() <= (1 << HARDIRQ_SHIFT)
was the test I arrived at since it was most explicit - One level
of (local timer) interrupt over idle task and no softirq in between
is OK to indicate that the cpu had seen an idle task. A bigger
hardirq_count() indicates reentrant hardirq over idle task and we
are no longer safe.
So, let's drop the HARDIRQ_OFFSET change.
