I have exactly the same problems you mentioned earlier in this thread. I
get the Ooops at various steps in the boot process. Sometimes the system
hangs directly after depmod, sometimes it can calculate the dependencies
and freezes when loading the first module (here: vfat.o)
This happens with 2.5.3 on a system with an IDE harddisk and root fs on
reiserfs.
