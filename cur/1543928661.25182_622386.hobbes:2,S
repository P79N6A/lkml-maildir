Thank you for your good job.
I tested shpchp and pciehp both with and without pci_slot module. There
seems no regression from shpchp and pciehp's point of view.
(I had a little concern about the hotplug slots' name that vary depending
on whether pci_slot functionality is enabled or disabled. But, now that we
can build pci_slot driver as a kernel module, I don't think it is a big
problem).
Only the problems is that I got Call Traces with the following error
messages when pci_slot driver was loaded, and one strange slot named
'1023' was registered (other slots are fine). This is the same problem
I reported before.
    sysfs: duplicate filename '1023' can not be created
    WARNING: at fs/sysfs/dir.c:424 sysfs_add_one()
    kobject_add failed for 1023 with -EEXIST, don't try to register
    things with the same name in the same directory.
On my system, hotplug slots themselves can be added, removed and replaced
with the ohter type of I/O box. The ACPI firmware tells OS the presence of
those slots using _STA method (That is, it doesn't use 'LoadTable()' AML
operator). On the other hand, current pci_slot driver doesn't check _STA.
As a result, pci_slot driver tryied to register the invalid (non-existing)
slots. The ACPI firmware of my system returns '1023' if the invalid slot's
_SUN is evaluated. This is the cause of Call Traces mentioned above. To
fix this problem, pci_slot driver need to check _STA when scanning ACPI
Namespace.
I'm sorry for reporting this so late. I'm attaching the patch to fix the
problem. This is against 2.6.24-rc3 with your patches applied. Could you
try it?
BTW, acpiphp also seems to have the same problem...
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
