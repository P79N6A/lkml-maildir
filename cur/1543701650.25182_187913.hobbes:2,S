Hmm, I do not see it. i8042_controller_reset() is only called on suspend/
shutdown. The init path where we vigorously testing the hardware and saving
initial CTR value was left intact.
As far as checking the return value we usualy give some leniency on suspend/
shutdown and don't fail the entire process when there are non-clitical errors.
Or am I missing something?
