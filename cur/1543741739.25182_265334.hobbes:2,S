On RT-V0.4.1, xruns seems slighly reduced, but plenty enough for my taste.
Running jackd -R with 6 fluidsynth instances gives me 0 (zero) xruns on
RT-U3, but more than 20 (twenty) on RT-V0.4.1, under a 5 minute time
frame. It was 30 (thirty something) on RT-V0.4, but overall "feel" is
about the same.
Cheers.
