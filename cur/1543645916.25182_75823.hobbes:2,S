hi,
with the VIA EPIA-mini-ITX motherboards (with VIA 8601A north bridge and 
VT8231 south bridge), when booting, the
following message is displayed :
	Jun 23 21:21:30 look1 kernel: Unknown bridge resource 0: assuming transparent
	Jun 23 21:21:30 look1 kernel: Unknown bridge resource 2: assuming transparent
	Jun 23 21:21:30 look1 kernel: PCI: Using IRQ router default [1106/0601] at 
00:00.0
and the local APIC is then disabled.
is a VIA chipset missing in pci-irq.c 8601A (1106/0601) missing in 
pirq_routers table in arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c (arch/i386pci/pci-irq.c 
for 2.5.x)  ?
I'm new to this ML and tried to give just the necessary info. if needed, I 
can give more details ...
