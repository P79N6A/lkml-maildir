 I'm not sure I understand. I'm assuming you can do
something along the lines of:
 // application accepts new socket
 new_socket_fd = accept()
 // application registers interest with epoll
 write(dev_poll_fd, new_socket_fd):
   drivers/char/eventpoll.c:ep_insert():
    - add new_socket_fd to interest list
    - check new_socket_fd for readable, writable, and
      error. if any true, then add new event to 
      event queue, as if the state had changed.
 // application asks for current set of events
 app: ioctl(dev_poll_fd, EP_POLL):
   drivers/char/eventpoll.c:ep_poll():
     - return the current event queue
 In other words, when new fd's are added to the
interest set, you generate synthetic events which
are returned at the next ioctl(EP_POLL).
 Are you saying that isn't possible? It's the
suggested behavior from the BMD paper, so evidently
they got it to work somehow (and I suspect it's how
Solaris /dev/poll works, but I'm not sure)
