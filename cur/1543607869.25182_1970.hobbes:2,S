AFAIK, the jiffies field _is_ unsigned already. In fact 2.0 kernels had some
problems at 2^31 HZ as well. (Stuff like select misbehaving, and some
procps utils giving incorrect results). 
2^32 HZ is 2^32/100 seconds is 2^32/3600/100/24 = 497.1 days.
2^31 HZ is 2^31/100 seconds is 2^31/3600/100/24 = 248.55 days.
(HZ=1/100 by default on x86 etc, it is 1/1024 or 1/1000 at least on alpha).
You need 64 bit jiffies for longer uptimes.
BTW, on win95 the HZ is 1024, which caused it to _always_ crash if it ever
reached 48.5 days of uptime. I've seen NT4 SMP to to crash at same point as
well (though it doesn't do it always).
