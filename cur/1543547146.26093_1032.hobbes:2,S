I kind of overloaded CAP_SYS_RAWIO to restrict access to bits
of arbitrary memory.  Maybe this one should require CAP_PTRACE
and CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE instead.

What level of interface does it offer?  If it's a simple read/
write, then it's no more RAWIO than /dev/hda.
Once upon a time I had a big patch which caught a lot of these
things (funny devices, device setup ioctl()s, etc) but nobody
seemed interested in it.  Really, I think that set of available
capabilities needs refactoring.
