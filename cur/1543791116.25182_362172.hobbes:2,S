There is some information about at least MMC controllers at:

The controller your working with is found here:

 From your page:

All controllers I've seen so far either give raw access to the MMC bus 
or completely abstracts the MMC bits (making it a USB storage device or 
similar). In other words, you probably won't see any information other 
than the fact that a card has been inserted.
