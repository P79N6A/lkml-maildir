XFS already knows this (stripe unit, stripe width) and already
does stripe unit sized and aligned allocation where it can.

I'm interested in what you think is necessary here, Neil.
But I think there's more to it than this - the filesystem only
writes back what the generic writeback code passes it (i.e. a page
at a time). XFs writes back extra adjacent pages in each I/O
if they are in the same state, but it might take multiple
I/Os to write out a full stripe units if we are doing things
like writing across a hole.
Also, there is no guarantee that the first page the filesystem
receives lies at the start of a stripe boundary, so that
sort of information really needs to be propagated into
the generic writeback code above the filesystem as well....
IOWs, the files can easily end I/Os on stripe boundaries
but it is much harder to start them there because that is
not in the control of the filesystem.
Cheers,
Dave.
