That will sleep, so it better not be called while in interrupt context
or apparently also, while atomic with preemptive kernels(?).

That's the dev->get_wireless_stats handler. I have assumed that it is
allowed to sleep there, but apparently that is not the case with Linux
2.5.x (at least with CONFIG_PREEMPT). I added a workaround for this into
Host AP CVS, but you will not get signal quality statistics in that
case. I'll do a proper fix if that function is indeed not allowed to
sleep (e.g., by collecting the statistics before and just copying the
values here).
Jean, do you have a comment on this? This happens, e.g., when executing
'cat /proc/net/wireless':
