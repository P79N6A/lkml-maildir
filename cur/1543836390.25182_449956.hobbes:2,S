Subject: [PATCH] fix dubious segment register clear in cpu_init()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Fix a very dubious piece of code in
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c:cpu_init().  This clears out %fs and
%gs, but clobbers %eax in the process without telling gcc.  It turns
out that gcc happens to be not using %eax at that point anyway so it
doesn't matter much, but it looks like a bomb waiting to go off.
This does end up saving an instruction, because gcc wants %eax==0 for
the set_debugreg()s below.
