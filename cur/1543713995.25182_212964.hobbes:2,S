Sounds good - maybe I'd misread your intentions - sorry.

If you're doing things that are logically nodes on the system anyway,
that makes sense. However, I really hate the idea of breaking up existing
logical groupings of memory just to do hotplug ... zones represent a logical
type of memory to the system, where the memory is somehow logically 
"different" from that in other zones (eg it fullils some restraint of
DMA or "permanently mapped kernel space", or has a different locality
to cpus (NUMA)). Yes, I know the current non-NUMA discontigmem violates
that premise (and thus must die ;-)).
Perhaps I'm confusing your patches with sombody elses - it gets hard 
to keep track of all the groups involved, sorry ;-)

I don't think we have control over that - it's a machine issue.

ia32 has a really hard time doing that, as it has to be in permanent
KVA space. Moreover, you have alignment requirements between sections.
Probably for the first cut, we'll have to just reserve enough mem_map 
for any physical address that might appear for that machine. If Dave's
nonlinear stuff can sort out the alignment requirements, we can probably 
do a "vmalloc-like" remapping out of physical ranges in the new mem
segment, much as I did in remap_numa_kva for NUMA support.
