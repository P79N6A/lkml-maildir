A patched whois, that is. Sorry I forgot to point that out.

I believe you. With an unpatched whois, no .org domain should ever be
found. In absence of a patch, please try
whois -h whois.pir.org <domainname.org>
instead of whois <domainname.org> . That should cure the problem.

Thanks anyway for pointing out the problem with unpatched whois. I guess
my first comment was a bit misleading in light of that.
HTH,
