Why?  Methinks a library would suffice, especially for trivial archive
formats (ar comes to mind).  There's no need for special kernel involvement,
except perhaps to make it transparent --- and a stdio extension to allow
transparent redirection of I/O for specially-configured (FILE)s would solve
that one just as well.
