Did not think about __data.__lock
I said "hack_alert" explicitely as this was just a work around, so we
could use an PI futex for the outer one, which was used to protect other
things too. The assmebler code corrupted the lock field of the outer
mutex with 0/1/2.

Sebastians patch might solve this.
Is there a way to (pre)set the policy of the inner lock or is there any
other solution in sight ?
