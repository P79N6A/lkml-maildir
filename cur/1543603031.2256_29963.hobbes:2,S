Ok I'll bite .. and only because I'm stuck dealing with W2k on occasion..
Yea look and drool at the fined grained access controls MS has .. then go
try getting IIS to run as anything other than administrator.. 
Access controls are good only when used.  MS security doesn't ever seem to
take possible flaws in daemons into account.
Now add the fun of things mysteriously breaking when hotfixes are applied.
Wonder why admins are afraid to apply them?  I have a W2k Machine that now
crashes twice weekly since the latest updates were applied. That's up from
a crash every 1 or 2 months.
Off hand I'd call that an inherent weakness.
Meanwhile Apache on my boxes either runs as "nobody" or as a user
dedicated to the web server.  Linux may not have the cool access controls
but at least the existing security controls are actually USED.

C2 is only a standard for user permissions and access tracking .. it is
NOT security. Same goes for crypto.. I'm very sick of people telling me
they can't be "hacked" because they have "encryption"
Unix and clones tend to be more secure not because of some whiz bang
buzzword compliant toy but because on the whole it's designers have tended
to look at *why* a given hack was done or *why* a given worm spread and
chased the problem instead patching the current bug and relying on band
aid software that attempts to track a given problem based on it's
signature.  
I'm honestly surprised more exploits aren't polymorphic for the express
purpose of evading the anti virus programs.
patches and AV -vs- buffer overflow detecting libraries and compilers not
to mention the principal of least privilege.
