Hello, everyone. I've been benchmarking MySQL under high load on Linux ( kernel
2.2.12, glibc 2.1.2), and noticed a rather interesting occurence with unusually
slow connection establishment process ( compared to how fast the actual query
would execute, which I traced to a problem in pthread_create() in glibc:
The problem is that when the system has many threads running and is doing a lot
of context switches, it takes unusually too long to get from pthread_create()
call to the first line of the function that is being passed as a parameter to
pthread_create() - in other words, pthread_create() is taking too long to create
the thread.
Does anybody have an explanation of why, and maybe even solution to the problem?
