I thought about that. If the number of receive bytes in the RX FIFO
is less that the trigger level then a timeout has to occur before
getting the next receive data interrupt.
The 16550AF data book says that this timeout is 4 characters
from when the last byte is received. This is a maximum of 160ms
at 300bps (when using 12bit characters: 1 start + 8 data + parity + 2 stop).
So this would be smaller at 9600 and could not account
for the 500ms delay.
