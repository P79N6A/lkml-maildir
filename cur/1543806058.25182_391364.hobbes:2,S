I think it is the most portable implementation.
And I'm trying not to write my own code in this patch set.

Currently there is no architecture using this atomic *_bit() routines
on SMP. But it may be the benefit of those who are trying to port Linux.

If the interrupt handler also wants to do bit manipilation then
you can get a deadlock between the original caller of *_bit() and the
interrupt handler.
