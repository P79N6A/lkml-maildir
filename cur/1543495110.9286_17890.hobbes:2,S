But that's the point. They're testing wether NT or Linux is faster as an NT
fileserver. If the results come out positive for Linux, you've got some more
material you can use to convince the department's manager that they shouldn't
replace the aging NT server with new hardware, but with Linux.

Likewise, if you test with a SCSI controller (say a nice RAID controller) that
isn't supported by Linux, you can prove NT is infinitely faster on that
particular hardware (but it's kind of silly).

Companies are looking into replacing an NT server with a Linux server. The
Linux box would have to provide the same services as the NT server and would
have to be cheaper and faster. However, a lot of managers don't realise you
need someone with some UNIX knowledge to maintain that box. If this knowledge
isn't available, than it's probably not worth it, even if the Linux box is
twice as fast and twice as cheap. You would have to get somebody trained and
that would surely cost more.
