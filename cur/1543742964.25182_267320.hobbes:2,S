Pete, i don't know if you have seen my previous posts...
I did now have a look at the comments in ub.c
Looks like the driver is very new and a lot has yet to be done.
I cannot really tell what of the points on the todo list may be related to my

for either.
What is the difference to the usb-storage driver?
