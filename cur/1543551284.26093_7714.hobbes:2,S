Subject: 2.4.0-test9 boot failure (alpha noritake)

Booting test9 gives me:
PCI: failed to allocate resource 0 for: Q Logic ISP1020
PCI: failed to allocate resource 0 for: <dec tulip card>
PCI: failed to allocate resource 0 for: <3com card>
Then it gets to:
Net4: Unix domain sockets 1.0/SMP for Linux NET4.0.
and hard locks
this is an alphaserver 1000a (noritake) with a pci-pci bridge.
the qlogic scsi and the 2 nics are on the secondary bus.
No 2.4 kernels have ever worked on this machine.
.config available upon request.  (as if anyone's going to answer me anyway,
noone has yet)
