i assume that's the intention but i don't know when 2.6.8 is and how
much time the sgi people have before then.  my guess is yes though

CVS is "stable linux releases + XFS fixes" --- it's really not that
bad (whilst i personally don't use it, my tree is derieved from it and
i don't have problems)

  cd path/to/workarea
  cvs -qz9 -d :pserver:cvs@oss.sgi.com:/cvs co linux-2.6-xfs
  cd linux-2.6-xfs
  cp path/to/old/.config .config

FWIW, the CVS tree isn't freshly checked in, it's a reflection of the
internal ptools tree where in theory you shouldn't get adhoc checkins
like lots of places (but yeah, it does sometimes break but not usually
badly).
Anyhow, if you don't like it you can (1) ingnore the problems (2) use
official binary releases from vendors (3) use ext3, etc.
whatever works for you...
