Ok !
I rerun the program and this is what I got:
-------------------------
140
141
142
143
Out of memory for update.
Out of memory for klogd.
Out of memory for sendmail.
Out of memory for crond.
Out of memory for syslogd.
Out of memory for gpm.
Out of memory for gpm.
Out of memory for kerneld.
Out of memory for init.
INIT: PANIC: segmentation violation! giving up..
[Giu@localhost Giu]$
-------------------------
When it printed #143, there was a pause of about 5-10 seconds between 
every line and no disk activity.
Then the system was still usable, but all that daemos were zombified 
and there was no core dump.
[kernel 2.2.9
 PowerPC604e
 64MB ram
~90MB swap]
Bye.
