This introduces one new thing which is really incompatible with 
POSIX filesystems, a file that can also act as a directory.
What is the basic reason why this directory can't live in a special
directory called ".fork"?  So instead of doing "cd file-with-forks"
one does "cd .fork/file-with-forks"?
That would work on ext2, NFS or any POSIX like filesystem.  
The disadvantage is that there will be a magic directory called
.fork (with the same permissions as the parent directory I suppose)
which can't be renamed or deleted.  The subdirectories inside
the .fork-directory would have the same permissions as the 
corresponding file and would have the same limitations as mounted
filesystems, no hardlinks outside of the directory.  And if one
deletes or renames the parent, the .fork directory follows.
