I have been wondering what to do about processor affinity and kernel
threads. I just concluded "only root can change it, and we can let root
stab herself if she really wants to."
But if this is really an issue, why not just do:
	ret = -EINVAL;
	if (!p->mm)
		goto out_unlock;
in sys_sched_setaffinity ?
