No we are defining steps towards improving the drivers on Linux, the
first step is the requirement to fix suspend/resume, and allow
modesetting on multiple crtc/output combinations, the other goals are
not directly within the scope of this work, you can take steps to do
get where we want, but we don't need to move all drivers at once to
get there... we also can't just merge something like that to the
kernel...
Your old ideas were mostly limited by the fact that you didn't get the
crtc/output distinction and persisted with the idea of heads which put
policy in the kernel, this was a major failing you never discovered,
and I didn't probably look enough at the time, since then Keith
Packard has done a lot of work on randr 1.2 to show the path to what
we actually wanted.
Dave.
