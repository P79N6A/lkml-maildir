I think we have 2 completely independant problems:
a) POSIX inode numbers [ino_t].
They must be unique, and programs such as tar uses them to identify the
target of hardlinks. It's currently 32-bits on i386, mips, mips64; 64-bits
on ia64, sparc64.
We don't support lookups based on ino_t, and we don't need it for NFS.
b) the ability to find an disk entry given a "key".
required for NfsV2, NfsV3.
This key should remain stable across rename, chown, reboot, .., and it
should never be reused for another file.
The key is quite long [NfsV2: 32 bytes, but several bits are required to
identify the superblock, optimizations]
I have no real idea how to solve that problem, I'm stuck with hardlinks:
/fs: mount point for a filesystem.
/fs/exported/
/fs/not-exported/: 2 folders
<local user>:
    cp /bin/sh /fs/exported/f1
<nfsd gets a filehandle to f1>
<local user>:
    mv /fs/exported/f1 /fs/not-exported/
    (* what happens to the nfs file handle? still valid, or EACCES?*)
    ln /fs/not-exported/f1 /fs/exported/f2
    (* what now? Does it become valid again?*)

Who needs "open-by-inode"?
