This has always been subtle and not too revealing.  It probably should
have a comment. The page_in_zone_hole check is for ia64 
VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP. You might compute a page structure which is in a hole not 
backed by memory; an unallocated page which covers pages structures. 
VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP uses a contiguous virtual region with virtual space holes
not backed by memory. Take a look at ia64_pfn_valid.

Yes. I'll defer to Andy whether he wants the zonenum check or to align
HIGHMEM corrrectly.
