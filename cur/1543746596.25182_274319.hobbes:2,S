	Some card do the scan automatically in firmware. You just need
to say "perform the scan", and after a while it will return some
results. Other card don't have support for it, so you need to go on
each frequency, send a probe request and look at the beacons.
	A helpful hint : scanning is done for the initial association
of the card to the BSSID. If the card perform all the association by
itself (just give an ESSID), it usually has an interface to perform
scanning. If you have to write the code to perform all the association
in the driver, then you can reuse that code to implement scanning.
