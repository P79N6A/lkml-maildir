well, I have an idea how to find out more about these verify problem. Basically
I would try to patch tar to ouput the differing areas to stdout in hexdump
format or the like. Only I need some time to make this work out. I hope to find
some pattern about this corruption.

Hm, my primary belief is that something _around_ reiserfs has changed
semantics.

Hm, I believe nobody in fact tried a setup like mine. As I have clear
indication that I can trigger it simply by using an SMP box, installing SuSE
8.2, compiling stock 2.4.22-rc2 kernel exporting some reiserfs to a nfs-client
of your choice and starting copying data with sizes around 100GB back and
forth.

Ok, will do that.

Does this work for ext3, reiserfs or both?
