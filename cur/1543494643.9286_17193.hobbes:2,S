One of these days I'll get enough time to look into this, but I was
amongst the people shouting that his device must be broken until
yesterday I ran into the same problem.
The Linux kernel is slow enough in responding to media changes that I

reinserted. There really is something murky going on here, but I
haven't had time to fully investigate yet.
