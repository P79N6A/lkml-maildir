I've also been experiencing similar PCI parity error prints lately on
fairly recent hardware, shortly after the prints show up the syscam
sometimes just locks up without further prints / panics, running recent
kernels -- 2.6.14+. 
Can anyone please shed some light on what can cause such errors, how can
they be debugged / addressed?
