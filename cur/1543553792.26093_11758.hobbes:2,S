C problem? You would better say , library problem(but it's not a problem at
all).

I dont think it's undefined behaviour ...
Text from malloc.c <glibc2.something>
<------snip-------->
Malloc Algorithm:
 
    The requested size is first converted into a usable form, `nb'.
    This currently means to add 4 bytes overhead plus possibly more to
    obtain 8-byte alignment and/or to obtain a size of at least
    MINSIZE (currently 16, 24, or 32 bytes), the smallest allocatable
    size.  (All fits are considered `exact' if they are within MINSIZE
    bytes.)
<----- snip --------->
So some area of MINSIZE is alloced , and you can write there... 
Problems will arrive with writing over this area, and overwriting next memory
chunk header. Write is not a problem ... in your code you have 4KB to spare,
but when you try to free() you'd probably get SIGSEG. 
Hope that you have idea how it works now. If not, read the malloc.c comments to
find about about how malloc realy works.
