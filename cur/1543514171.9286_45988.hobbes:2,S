Is it possible you gone out of memory recently? To be sure you can try to
reproduce with my OOM fixes applyed. They will take care of init. If your
problem is a segfault due oom I just fixed it long ago. The good news is
that my oom fixes are going to be in the official 2.2.14 as well :). For
now apply my patch (it will apply cleanly both on the top of stock 2.2.12
and 2.2.13):

(note: the patch fixes a couple of other serious OOM bugs as well, it's
not only for init)
