I am running Red Hat 6.0 on a 2.2.12 kernel right now and providing
NFS service with knfsd.  Am I unwittingly doing something dangerous?
(All my clients are Linux, for now; the RPM is knfsd-1.2.2-4.)
The init.d/knfsd script appears to start and stop everthing fine.
What it is, exactly, that I should expect not to work?
Apologies in advance if these are stupid questions, but I suspect I am
not alone in my confusion...
