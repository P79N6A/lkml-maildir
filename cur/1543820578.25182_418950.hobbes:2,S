If the parent directory exists, yes.  LSM could do that too.  If the
parent directory does not exist, then you cannot create an audit rule.
I.e. if /var/spool/mail does not exist, you cannot watch
/var/spool/mail/hallyn.  If you have an active rule for
/var/spool/mail/hallyn and you rm -rf /var/spool/mail, the audit rule is
implicitly deleted.  If you then recreate /var/spool/mail, and touch
/var/spool/mail/hallyn, you get no audit entries.

What is the wrong assumption?  That it has to be "at the syscall level"?
Ok, it has to be done at syscall entry or exit, if you prefer.  Using
syscall auditing, catching all fs events, and grepping with ausearch.

Nope.
