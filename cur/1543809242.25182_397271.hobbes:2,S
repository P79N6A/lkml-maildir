Ingo, you have tried to come up with an algorithm, Nick tried equally,
and I have tried.  None of the "smart algorithms" works right now.  The
workload requirements are on two opposite end of spectrum.  If you do
one thing, it will hurt the other and vice versa.  I don't see a solution
other than a sysctl.  If you have implementation idea, I would be more
than happy to code it up and test. But I think we are really running dry
here.
