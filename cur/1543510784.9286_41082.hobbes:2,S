I working on a patch which move the vendor id stuff for the supported ISDN
cards to the PCI related files, including text values for the /proc/pci
stuff, be patience.
But all the stuff related on vendor ID and device ID only work with
known cards ( and only supported cards are known).
The ID=XXXX is the fallback, if here is no text for this ID available.
