Hi
I am browsing linux TCP MIB header code and I see many fields but no
explanation on what those fields are.
Some of them are obvious but others are not.
you can see all of them by typing
/proc/net/netstat
Does anyone know about what these fields contain? Is it documented anywhere?
I did a google but could not find anything.
Thanks
Arcot
