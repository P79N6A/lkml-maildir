Well, that's not quite accurate.  It also mentions that OEM IDs for 
vendors come from the ACPI SIG, and they also reserved the "IBFT" 
signature with the ACPI SIG (it's in ACPI 3.0).  It's also pretty clear 
that the "Locating the iBFT" section in the spec used to be a list with 
more than one entry and has been edited down to one.
That being said, I don't think there's any reason to expect the table to 
show up on anything but i386 and x86_64, and maybe ia64.
