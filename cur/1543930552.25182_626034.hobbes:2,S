And the code example should be fixed too:
	   char ch, attrib;
           (void) read(fd, &ch, 1);
           (void) read(fd, &attrib, 1);
should rather be
	   unsigned short s;
	   unsigned char ch, attrib;
	   ...
           (void) read(fd, &s, 2);
	   ch = s & 0xff;
	   attrib = (s >> 8);
The manual page should also mention that when a 512 chars font is
loaded, the 9th bit is in the attrib value, and its position can be
fetched through the VT_GETHIFONTMASK ioctl.
