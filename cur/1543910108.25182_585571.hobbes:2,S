But for atomic_t people use atomic_inc() anyways which does this correctly.
It shouldn't really matter for atomic_t.
I'm worrying a bit that the volatile atomic_t change caused subtle code 
breakage like these delay read loops people here pointed out.
Wouldn't it be safer to just re-add the volatile to atomic_read() 
for 2.6.23? Or alternatively make it asm(), but volatile seems more
proven.
