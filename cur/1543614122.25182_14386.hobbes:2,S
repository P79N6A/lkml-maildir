Subject: [PATCH] ptrace on stopped processes (2.4)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/12/21/89

This patch fixes a couple problems with ptrace's interaction with
stopped processes on Linux 2.4.
The most significant bug is that gdb cannot attach to a stopped
process.  Specifically, the wait that follows the PTRACE_ATTACH will
block indefinitely.
Another bug is that it is not possible to use PTRACE_DETACH to leave a
process stopped, because ptrace ignores SIGSTOPs sent by the tracing
process.
This patch is against 2.4.16 on x86.  I have tested gdb and strace.
After this patch is reviewed, I would be happy to submit an analogous
patch for the other platforms, although I cannot test it.
