If it's done by samba, it's racy. Only the kernel can reliably tell a
write-beyond-eof from a write-before-eof. Either it should unconditionally
turn these preallocation-writes into truncates, or have a flag which will
turn this feature on and which can be used to turn the lseek into a real
preallocation call.
I don't think unconditionally turning these writes into truncate would be
good, it would change the behaviour of dd bs=1 count=$(($n*$BLOCKSIZE+1)).
