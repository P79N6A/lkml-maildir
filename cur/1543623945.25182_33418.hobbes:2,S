I don't think so -- modprobe logs its attempts in /var/log/ksymoops/ and
there aren't nearly as many attempts to load net-pf-10 logged there as
pages I reloaded.
Besides if you were right, it would do the same thing in the unchanged
ac kernel -- try to load ipv6 each time and fail -- and I'd presumably
see the skipping there, too.

No argument from me.

AMD K6-III, just to be specific.

I'd expect to see the skipping regardless, then, right?  I'll give it a
shot tonight and report back.
