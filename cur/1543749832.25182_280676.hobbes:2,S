Well, I presume you know this, but at least in 2.6.9, there's no
warning.  When I read it, it said:
   CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB:
   This driver supports certain USB attached storage devices
   such as flash keys.
   If unsure, say N.
which sounded potentially useful, and certainly didn't give the
impression that the driver was likely to perform terribly in common
cases (i.e. when using an external drive).
The sample Kconfig warnings I saw posted later in this thread would
certainly have given enough information to know to avoid the driver,
though if true, this might be even clearer:
  Note: this driver does not coexist well with usb-storage, and
  usb-storage is is often the best driver for common devices like
  external drive enclosures.  At the moment, usb-storage may peform
  dramatically better for those devices.
  If you're not certain you need this driver, you should probably
  say 'N' here, and choose usb-storage instead.
