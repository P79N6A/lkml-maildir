Don't formally send it until it's ready.  Seriously.  You can always resend
it if it didn't get applied anywhere.
Once a patch reaches a sufficient level of maturity for it to be ready to
be merged into a subsystem tree, any subsequent changes should be
sufficiently small that incremental patches are the way to apply touchups.
The core problem here is that (lots of) people are flinging patches at
tree-owners before they are sufficiently baked.
