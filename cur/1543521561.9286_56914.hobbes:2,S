Having a mount method on file is great. You just call it. If the file in
question doesn't support it, it says so. Alternately, you have to check
whether you're mounting a block device in the syscall. In terms of code,
it's six of one, half dozen of the other. I just think it's better to have
that half dozen down in the driver function tables or in a helper function
for block device registration rather than as if statements all over the
place.

The funny part is that you're one of the more vocal opponents of inode
bloat (the per-fs part in particular) so you should know better. ;)
