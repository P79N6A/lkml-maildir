Hi all,
Is there anything like 'losetup' that allows choosing encryption
algorithm for a loopback device that can be used on compression
algorithms? Or in other words, when the data passes through loopback
device to a real storage device, it can be filtered and the filter is
compression instead of encryption; when kernel ask for data in a storage
device that is mounted to a loopback device with compression, it will be
filtered again -- decompressed.
If there is not a ready-to-use method for this, is there any way I can
implement the idea?
TIA! Really appreciate any comments.
Lei
