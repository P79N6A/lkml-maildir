Yes, there is a patch for ext2 that does this as well.

There already exists a patch for reiserfs which uses the same interface
to file attributes that ext2 and ext3 use.
Also, ext2 already has a "compressed", "do not compress", and "dirty"
attributes.  They are currently not all user modifyable for ext2
filesystems via chattr/lsattr, but that doesn't mean they cannot be
on reiserfs.

Yes, there is also such an attribute for "raw" access I think.
Making the user-space interface and tools as compatible as possible is
a good thing, IMHO, just like "ls", "cp", etc all work regardless of
the underlying filesystem.
As a note to whoever at namesys created the reiserfs patch to add the
"notail" flag (overloading the "nodump" flag).  I would much rather
that a new "notail" flag be allocated for this.  I will contact Ted
Ted Ts'o to get a flag assigned.  This will avoid any problems in the
future, and may also be useful at some time for ext2.
Cheers, Andreas
