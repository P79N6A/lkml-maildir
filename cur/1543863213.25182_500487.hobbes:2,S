the core of the problem are the cores which are customarily
dumped by lisps during the environment generation (or modification) stage,
and then mapped back, every time the environment is invoked.
at the current step of evolution, those core files are not relocatable
in certain natively compiling lisp systems.
in an even smaller subset of them, these cores are placed after
the shared libraries and the executable.
which obviously breaks when the latter are placed unpredictably.
(yes, i know, currently mmap_base() varies over a 1MB range, but who
says it will last indefinitely -- probably one day these people
from full-disclosure will prevail and it will become, like, 256MB ;-)
so, what do you propose?
