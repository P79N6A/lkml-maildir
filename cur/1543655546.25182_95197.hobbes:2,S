My bad, sorry. This conclusion came from a quick disassemble of a small
program I run on those boxes which indeed contain cmovs and I believed
that the boxes execercise the complete program but obviously not. 
A quick check with a just written testprogram calculating some primes 
revealed that -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 does *not* work...
