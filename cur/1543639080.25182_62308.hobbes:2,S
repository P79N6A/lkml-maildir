Marcelo,
Well here is the long a waited "I Told You So, but You Would Not Listen".
It worked just fine until you all decided to let an OEM get in the game
and dictate the changes.  Back out the cruft and return sanity to an
insane world.  Just because and OEM makes hardware does not mean they can
make it run proper.
Cheers,
