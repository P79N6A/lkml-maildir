Great! I'll be on holidays for the rest of this week, but Cornelia
should look if there are any conflicts with what we need to support
the 'multiple subchannel devices make up a network device' scheme
that our architecture dictates.
On the user space side I still have one patch for modutils to implement
modules.ccwmap. I want to be sure that its interface is stable
before submitting it, though.

Not initially, but if the 'single major for all disks' stuff that has 
been discussed makes it into 2.5, we have to make sure that dasd works
with that.
We already have a hotplug implementation for 2.4 dasd that could be
ported instead, but a generic solution would be much nicer.
