Busy wait loops are meant to be filled with cpu_relax() in Linux.  On
processors like the Pentium 4 this expands into something that keeps
the CPU from consuming excessive amounts of energy for just twiddling
thumbs and probably also CPU dependant.  On MIPS cpu_relax() so far is
meaningless and therfore just defined as barrier().
