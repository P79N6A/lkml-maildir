In the two prior discussions on this, the disagreement was on how much 
confusion
(if any) the use of CLONE_* flags would generate. I personally did not 
think that
it was confusing enough to add new flags, with the same values as CLONE_*
flags, in the kernel. Linus's last email (3/1/06) on the subject seemed 
to lean in that
direction as well. That's why I didn't take any action on it.
