I dont think thats quite the case. I'd actually suggest the right place to
ask about clusters is the extreme-linux list (see www.extreme-linux.org). These
guys are running real large beowulfs and will actually have data reflecting
that kind of usage. Also since they run these sites and have to justify them
financially they'll have more reliable data than others.
Alpha and SMP are both things that seem to reduce your MTBF ..
