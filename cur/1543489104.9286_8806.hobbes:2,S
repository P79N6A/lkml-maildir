Installed 2.2.3-pre3 last night and it ran overnight without problem. Went
to work this morning, was logged into the 2.2.3-pre3 box (which is at
home) and it locked up while reading mail. Could not ping it, etc.
Verified I could ping other machines around it so it was not a network
problem.  
Had my significant other reset the machine then I went in to look at logs
after it came back up.
WIERD STUFF:
I have tcp and icmp logging daemons  running on that machine. It logged
all of the pings I sent and the attempted telnet connections that never
returned anything (timed out). It was as if the box could hear but could
not speak over the net.
I was not at the console so I could not get too much information and it
is the nameserver for the local net so it had to come back up in a hurry.
Nothing is logged anywhere indicating a problem.
The ethernet is a tulip and is compiled into the kernel (not modular).
Sorry I couldn't get more info but I am not at the box. Since I could
communicate with other machines on the same net, it was not a router or
other network issue.
