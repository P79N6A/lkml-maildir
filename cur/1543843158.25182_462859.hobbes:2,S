Hm.  The resume on ubuntu's stock kernel worked for me.
Does your X60s have an SATA hard drive?

I'll try that out, thanks.  Hm.  It's not clear which of these patches
are the real final versions.  There appears to be some criticism of
his implementation
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ide&m=115334269706716&w=2) and
resending
(
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ide/12210
)
going on later on the same list.
And then there is a reimplementation of the same work...
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ide/12266
Maybe I'll try that latter set.  Thanks for the pointer.
