We do this because, at least when this code was written,
glibc would do a personality(PER_LINUX) call (either via
the dynamic linker or via some other libc startup code)
and this would undo the PER_LINUX32 setting.
Therefore, it makes sense to do this for all cases, not
just for 32-bit processes.  The x86_64 code ought to be
fixed, I think.
