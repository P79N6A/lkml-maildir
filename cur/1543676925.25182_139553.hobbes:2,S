The whole surround code seems rather bogus.  Most of the drivers actually
using this are PCI ones so we _know_ pci is present when this gets
called.  And for the few other it should probably be a per-driver
thing instead, i.e. if the device hangs of a specific pci bus use
the ide busspeed, else not.
