Hi Ingo,
	Thanks!  There are some interesting issues.  Because __get_cpu_var()
returns an lvalue, we don't use the %fs:value directly, but calculate
offset (%fs:this_cpu_off + &value).  So previously there was only a tiny
code reduction.
	If we used __thread, then gcc could do this optimization for us when it
knows an rvalue is needed, however:
1) gcc wants to use %gs, not %fs, which is measurably slower for the
kernel,
2) gcc wants to use huge offsets to store the address of the per-cpu
space, and this breaks Xen (and current lguest, but new lguest no longer
uses segments for protection)
One solution would be to expose x86_read_percpu() as read_percpu() and
implement it in asm-generic/percpu.h as well, then use it in places
where only an rvalue is required.
Cheers!
Rusty.
