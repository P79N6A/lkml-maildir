If my reading of the situation is correct, then those details are all
irrelevant anyway. All the kernel cares about is the state of the RTC
on the system, and few (if any) RTC chips go into that sort of detail.
Looking at it from that point of view, just TWO kernel variables will
deal with all cases of interest. Have a look at the specs for the
various RTC chips in use, and you'll generally find that they deal
with dates and times as follows:
 1. All days are considered to consist of exactly 86,400 seconds,
    which comprise 24 hours, each containing 60 minutes, and each
    of those minutes comprises exactly 60 seconds.
 2. There is NO indication as to the timezone in which the chip
    is set. This information is presumed to be set by an external
    source whenever the chip is initialised.
 3. There is a flag bit somewhere in the chip which indicates if
    the datestamp read from the RTC is DST or non-DST time. The
    value read from this chip when the said flag bit indicates
    non-DST time is the actual time stored in the various counters
    in the chip.
 4. I understand that there are RTC chips which have a register
    to indicate the offset to be applied for DST, but most RTC
    chips (including the one used in IBM PC clones) always use
    an offset of +60 minutes when returning DST datestamps.
Based on the above specification, the following patch (against 2.2.9)
would perform the basic requirements of such an algorithm, providing
most of the key features required. Comments inserted between the
various hunks as relevant.

The above two hunks add the necessary configuration option, and set it
to default to the RTC storing UTC times. Put it wherever you think
best fits, I'm not worried about that.

The above hunk creates a new script file containing the command needed
to determine the correct default timezone for the case where the RTC
is not storing times in UTC. This command should rightly be part of
the Makefile (next hunk), but I don't know how to insert it in the
right place, hence my use of a separate script file.

This last group of four hunks add the relevant code to implement the
functions as defined, with the following exception: I do not have the
spec sheet for the RTC chip, so can't insert the correct line to read
the value of the "Using DST" flag bit. This patch therefore assumes
that the said flag is always clear. To correct this, change the line
in the third of the above four hunks that currently reads "dst=0" to
set the variable dst to nonzero if the flag indicates "Using DST" and
zero if it indicates "Not using DST".

I have two systems that run the RTC in local time and one that runs it
in UTC, so can check both sides of this story. I haven't yet checked
the above patch though, and still have to do so.
Best wishes from Riley.
