Good luck.

AFAIK, usb-storage works fine with all those USB memory sticks / pen drives
without CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB and I have absolutely no idea whatsoever what
"flash keys" UB is supposed to support.
I would have assumed that UB enables you to use some flash
key (such as?) which isn't supported by any other USB driver but seems UB
stomps on usb-storage and breaks in many cases and you can't use the usual
USB CF-readers etc with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB=y because UB is buggy.
well, defconfig has CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB disabled.
maybe Pete Zaitcev can enlighten us.

"flash key" missing from that list? *shrug*
