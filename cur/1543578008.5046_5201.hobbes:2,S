You should monitor the program with strace while it fails (last few syscalls).
You can breakpoint at exit() and run `cat /proc/pid/maps` to show us the vma
layout of the task. Then we'll see why it's failing.  With CONFIG_1G in 2.2.x
or 2.4.x (confinguration option doesn't matter) you should at least reach
something like 1.5G.
