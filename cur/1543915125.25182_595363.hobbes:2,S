I don't see a particular problem with that.  If the whole 0x4xxxxxxx
range is reserved for hypervisor use, and existing hypervisors are
already using 0x400000xx in hypervisor-specific ways, then it makes
sense to start the generic stuff at 0x40001xxx (or some other offset). 
But without a few more implementations of the "generic" interface its
all a bit moot (ie, where's your code? ;).

This just seems a bit grotty.  You're relying on the fact that you can
overlay Xen's current use of 0x4000000x for the generic interface by
freezing Xen's current use of 40000000-2.  0x40000000 becomes a more or
less useless hypervisor-identification signature (useless because you
need to assume that leaves 4000000x, x>2 implement the generic interface
anyway, where x=1,2 are reserved for Xen (=hypervisor-specific) uses).
In other words, what mechanism can a guest use to explicitly identify
the existence of the generic interface?  There needs to be a signature
for that somewhere.
