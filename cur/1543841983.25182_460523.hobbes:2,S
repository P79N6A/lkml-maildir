I was wondering if you were going to rely on stat() forcing the dentry to be
correctly initialised before you did mkdir(), but it seems not.

Okay, I suppose.  But that still doesn't seem to deal with the case of creating
a directory on the client that then overlays a symlink on the server that you
can't yet access.
You may also get ENOENT because you stat a symlink, though you'll get EEXIST
from mkdir, even if there's nothing at the far end.
