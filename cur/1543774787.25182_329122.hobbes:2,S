The device is seen, can be mounted and the filesystem listed, but file
transfers run very slow, i guess they stop after a few KB.
This happened in 2.6.12, 2.6.11.12 works well, everything else seems
to work perfectly. The device is a 256MB OTi Flash Disk, my USB host
is listed as a VIA VT6202, the motherboard is an MSI with A6712VMS
V1.9 072903 BIOS
