Subject: 2.3.41-3 mouse lockup with cardbus in kernel

Everything's fine after booting, finds my cardbus card just fine, keyboard's
working.  I touch the mouse, there goes my keyboard and the mouse never
worked (ps/2 mouse).  Telnet in, kill gpm, keyboard works again.  Cat
/dev/psaux, keyboard still works.  Touch the mouse, keyboard dies, nothing
sent through cat.  Kill cat, keyboard is ok again.
I don't know what's going on with this, but it looks odd to me that during
boot, I notice that the cardbus slots are detected and says 'irq 0' after
it.
Recompile kernel with pcmcia/cardbus as a module, mouse/keyboard works fine,
but no more access to pcmcia/cardbus devices.  Yenta won't load as a module
(missing kernel version).  Doesn't look like yenta is module capable.
