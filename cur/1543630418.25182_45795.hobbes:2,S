But the acenic driver author suggested that sndbuf should be at least
262144, and the sndbuf can not exceed r/wmem_default. Is that correct?
So for gigabit Ethernet driver, what is the optimal mem configuration
for performance and reliability?
Thanks,
Xiangping

Don't do this, setting the [rw]mem_default values to that is just
insane. Do it in the applications that needs it and nowhere else.

If you have a lot of outstanding connections and active threads, it's
not unlikely you run out of memory if each socket eats 4MB.
