Subject: Error in __bread reading a 4K block from a SATA device

Hello,
I'm trying to read a 4KB block using __bread from a SATA device but I get
the following error:
__find_get_block_slow() failed. block=1, b_blocknr=0
b_state=0x00000029, b_size=4096
If I try to read a 2K block (which is the hard sector size of the device),
it works fine.
Kernel version is 2.6.20.21. I have used this function at another system but
the device from which I read was an IDE one and it's hard sector size was
512 bytes. I've also tested this at a 2.6.18.8 kernel.
The old device was at a 32bit system, the new one is at a 64bit one.
What could be wrong?
Thanx in advance.
