um ... ok.  i think.  i agree that "probe_address()" would be a more
appropriate name, but i'm still a bit confused as to why
"__get_user()" would be used to access something *not* in user memory,
given this seemingly unambiguous explanation in
include/asm-i386/uaccess.h:
=====
 * get_user: - Get a simple variable from user space.
 * @x:   Variable to store result.
 * @ptr: Source address, in user space.
 *
 * Context: User context only.  This function may sleep.
 *
 * This macro copies a single simple variable from user space to kernel
 * space.  It supports simple types like char and int, but not larger
 * data types like structures or arrays.
  ...
=====
  so having probe_kernel_address() invoke __get_user() does seem to be
just a wee bit confusing for us newbies.  in any event, i'll leave the
clarification for someone much higher up the food chain.
