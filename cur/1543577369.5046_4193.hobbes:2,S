If it doesnt fix the pulling the plug case (at least as far as 'after fsync
returned this data is safe') then its not working. A journalling file system
is always consistent. fsync/sync/msync define write barrier operations.
Applications do have to deal with more things (partial dbase write for example)
but competently written databases and transaction managers handle this.
Ext3 has been tested on the random live switchoffs on a real box because 
ftp.linux.org.uk kept crashing during backups and it took us a while to figure
out that the network backup tool was backing up in /proc/bus/pci and stopping
the box dead when it backed up the pci config space of the ACPI controller.
