Because just multiplying the microseconds by one thousand doesn't really provide a 
nanosecond clock, maybe?

Did you ever do an analysis how this affected clock quality? See 
comp.protocols.time.ntp for all the complains about broken kernels (I think Redhat 
had it first, then the others followed).

You can have a look at the code. That's the point where you can decide about 
complexity. I haven't looked closely, but I guess it was O(1) before, and now also 
is O(1).

I never knew the 68k has such a poor performance.

If everybody would be keeping the current code, we wouldn't have any problems with 
the new code (as I said before). New features do cost some power unfortunately.
