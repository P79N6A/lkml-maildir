Hi Paul!
I've also noticed this mismatch. Not sure that this is a bug so much as 
just a question of sematics. I'm not sure what was originally intended 
for with these counters either. My latest patch (patch 6, 6.1 or maybe 
its not till 7) does change this though. Let me know if this change is 
what you're thinking of as a "fix".
With new accounting capabilities in gendisks and request_queues, I'm not 
sure how much use there is left for these request counters anymore. I 
don't know for certain, but I believe these are counted now in the new 
gendisk or request_queue accounting. So I have been eyeing these 
counters for removal (just so you know). Is there still definate use for 
these???
Thanks for looking at the other patches too. The multi-threading idea is 
loosing favor with me so long as I can get the blocking stratedgy 
working when sock is null. And I haven't heard from Steven as to the 
problem he thought they fixed. The blocking code is in my patch 7 
however which I haven't released yet. Wanted to get the ioctl user 
interface issues nailed first (before tackling changing the default 
semantics).
