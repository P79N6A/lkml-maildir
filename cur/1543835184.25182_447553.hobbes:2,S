Yep, the ondemand governor switches between all frequencies on my
Pentium 4 M laptop.  It's a HP Pavillion dv1240us.

I have tried the other governers (albeit a while ago) and found they
didn't manage power anywhere near as well as ondemand.  Perhaps
results vary for each governor according to CPU and chipset.
