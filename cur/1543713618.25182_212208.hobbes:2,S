Is it my imagination or is there an acute lack of interest in supporting 
notebook features in 2.6.X? Since the early days of 2.5.X, there have
been questions raised regarding suspend/resume and related questions of
critical importance to mobile users. All (at least those associated with
IBM ThinkPads) have been ignored by developers, with the only responses
coming from other notebook users expressing similar concerns.
Is the answer to upgrade to a faster notebook so I can get adequate
performance using the 2.4 kernel in order to retain the ability to
quickly and safely suspend / resume while on the road?
Side note: X23, kernel 2.6.5, SuSE 9.0 with Kraxel fixes. Suspend only
works while on battery, forgetting to unplug the AC first fails every
time and intermittently locks up the box.
