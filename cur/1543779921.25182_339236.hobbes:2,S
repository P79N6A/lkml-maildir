Well, if that "hack" broke something, it was broken
w.r.t. suspend-to-disk already, but... it caused enough problems that
it is not good idea for 2.6.13, agreed.

Yes, we should have different argument, but code should be really
similar in suspend-to-disk-powerdown and normal powerdown, so I'd like
to use same callback. This is post-2.6.13 material (but I'd like patch
to stay in -mm, so that drivers keep getting tested).

That one is fixed in -mm already. But I guess it will not make it into
2.6.13.
