I have no strong opinion on this issue.
All I dislike are email addresses that bounce when sending a Cc of a

But how do you plan to handle the email addresses in MODULE_AUTHOR?
Most people who see them don't have a MAINTAINERS/CREDITS on their 
computer (the same is true for email addresses in printk's).
