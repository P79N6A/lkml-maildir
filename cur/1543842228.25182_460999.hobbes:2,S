I did it that way just to get going, get something working. I do not
have hardware specs for any of these devices, and do not have much of 
an idea of what they are capable of; the recovery code I wrote is of
"brute force, hit it with a hammer"-nature.  Driver writers who 
know thier hardware well, and are interested in a more refined 
approach are encouraged to actualy use a more refined approach.
