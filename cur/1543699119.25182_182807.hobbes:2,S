We never never concluded that they never would, but we did (I think)
convince the gcc people that a memory operand to an asm should always be
considered a lvalue. That will effectively mean that we know a memory op
will never be moved around - because then it wouldn't be the same lvalue
any more (a lvalue is literally defined by its address).
So yes, I think we can depend on it now, although we historically
couldn't.
