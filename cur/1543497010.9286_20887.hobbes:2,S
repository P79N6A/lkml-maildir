I have a computer B that can not send to computer A
when computer A don't have its ethernet card in promisc mode.
A has ip 10.2.0.1
  and ip 10.1.0.1
B has ip 10.2.0.2
a route is added on B to rediected traffic for 10.1.0.x
to eth0
a route is added on A to rediected traffic for 10.2.0.x
to eth0
a route is added on A to rediected traffic for 10.1.0.x
to eth0
ping from B to 10.2.0.1 works
ping from B to 10.1.0.1 does not
turn on promisc mode on ethernet card A
and ping from B to 10.1.0.1 does.
I have kernel 2.0.37, what makes the
routing work when the promisc mode is on?
