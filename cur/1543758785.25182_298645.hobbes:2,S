I like it, but what about important security fixes or mistakes like
2.6.8.1?  In those situations, would you release that kernel under the
next even number and skip the odd number?  Or would you release the fix
under an odd number and sorta throw off the "meaning"?
I'm not trying to be a pain, I'm really not.
