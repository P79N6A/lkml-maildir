Based on my experience, cp and anything else that uses the filesystem 
gets buffered.  I can tell this because, without sync, the throughput 
varies with memory size.  Furthermore, I wanted to know raw throughput, 
so I used a block device so I could eliminate filesystem overhead.
Reading and writing the block device does not seem to be buffered 
because the run time is not affected by memory (host RAM) size.  That 
is, unless dd does an implicit sync.
The numbers I get when using dd to and from one of my drives under a 2.4 
kernel with the drive connected to the on-board IDE controller are 
roughly the same as published benchmarks.
