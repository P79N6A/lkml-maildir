Applying akpm's patch now, expect a result in 1-2 days since that's how long
it takes to begin to destabilize :-)

Ah, I see... your patch that added insert_sequence and remove_sequence
was intended to apply on top of the patch that adds
cancel_delayed_work().
Please ignore the reply to your patch that I just sent, I
misunderstood what you were trying to do.
Shawn, I think if you add Andrew's most recent patch on top of what
you were running with, your problem should probably be fixed.
Sorry for the extra noise.
