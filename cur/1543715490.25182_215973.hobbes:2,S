The O(N^2) behaviour is present on 2.4 too, but fortunately there's a
simple way to bring that down to O(N) without the complexity of adding
new lists and locking.  This patch simply rotates the dquot list-head
after each dquot write, so that the next scan walks the list starting
after the entry just processed.
For 40,000 dirty dquots, this brings sync time from 7 minutes and 50
seconds down to 0.8 seconds. :-)  On 2.4, we have BKL while doing this
list manipulation.  Jan Kara has acked this; please apply.
Cheers,
 Stephen
