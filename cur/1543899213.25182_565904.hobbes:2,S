	Do not mistake the use of autoconf with automake.  automake
generates the unreadable Makefiles.  You can quite easily create a
useful Makefile yourself and use autoconf to select installation
locations, detect features of older/newer libcs, etc.  See
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/makebo/
 for an example of a build system
that doesn't use automake, but allows for autoconf to do build-time
configuration (an example user of makebo is ocfs2-tools, see
 
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2-tools/src/trunk/
).
	And if you think that all packages should Just Work on all
Linuxen, with out any build-time detection, try determining the
differing udev layouts of FC6, FC7, Debian, Ubuntu, SuSE9, SuSE10, etc.
Or where manpages go.  The %configure of RPM specfiles and the
dh_installman of debian packages handle this for you...often because
they can use expected behavior of your build system.  What about
futexes?  Older systems don't have them.  Gotta detect that.
