You missed the point here. Yes, /usr/lib/perl is just fine. But what about
locally compiled modules ? You can download thing from CPAN, compile it
and install. It's simple: perl Makefile.PL ; make ; make install ...
It'll compile CPAN module and will install it ... where it'll install it ?
Currently it'll install it in /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/i386-linux
(arch-dependant files) or in /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl
(non-arch-dependant files). Emacs will search for additional packages in
/usr/share/emacs/20.7/site-lisp (and /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp) and so on.
And sysadmin can not change it easily: you need to recompile perl, emacs
or tcl. So instead of SINGLE place where all local stuff is stored
(/usr/local) you have LOCAL stuff scattered all over /usr :-( For C
libraries problem is solved: you can put .h files in /usr/local/include
and libraries in /usr/local/lib an your system compiler can find all
local stuff there. For other packages FHS offer no solution :-((
