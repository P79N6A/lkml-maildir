Personally, this concerns me.
I have a personal mailserver on my DSL line. Now, DSL isn't dialup,
but it's quite widespread and I'm sure it's even more popular among
spammers than the mass market. The doomsday scenario is that one day
all messages messages will have to be relayed through Hotmail, Yahoo,
or another one of a handful of large, untrustworthy corporations. Of
course I know this isn't likely, but what's to prevent people who
can't afford T1's from becoming unable to run mail servers?
It scares me that peoples' messages would be denied based on what
degree of connection they choose to mail via. I sincerely hope that
the DUL lists only list netblocks that are actively being used for
spam. This would be sort of like the Usenet Death Penalty, instating
bans on providers who refuse to deal with spamming. I think that's a
lot more acceptable than shutting everyone who happens to connect to
the internet in a certain way from sending mail directly out of their
local machines.
