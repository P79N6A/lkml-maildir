Sometimes we subtract 1 from zap_work, sometimes PAGE_SIZE.  It's in units
of bytes, so PAGE_SIZE is correct.  Although it would make sense to
redefine it to be in units of PAGE_SIZE.  What's up with that?
Even better, define it in units of "approximate number of touched
cachelines".  After all, it is a sort-of-time-based thing.
