Hi,
I'm running Linux kernel 2.4.7, and I'm seeing the following in my syslog:
Oct  5 09:13:44 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:45 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:46 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 525795537, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:46 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:47 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:48 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 525861077, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:48 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 525927291, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:48 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 525992033, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:48 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 526057939, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:48 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 526123899, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:48 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:49 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:49 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 526189001, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:50 camelot kernel: svc: short len 4, dropping request
Oct  5 09:13:50 camelot kernel: svc: bad direction 526254179, dropping request
several (3 to 5) messages per second.
I have tracked down these messages to coming out of:
        /usr/src/linux/net/sunrpc/svc.c
but I do not understand what's triggering them, or what to do about them.
any suggestions, pointers, hints appreciated.
thank you, and regards,
-Greg

   You can release software that's good, software that's inexpensive, or
   software that's available on time.  You can usually release software
   that has 2 of these 3 attributes -- but not all 3.
