I have a rather old linux box running a 1.2.13 kernel containing a driver
for a framegrabber card, written by someone who had already left quite a
while ago. And no, it's none of the bttv supported ones.
I would like to port these to a 2.2 (and maybe 2.0) kernel and I want to do
this *right*, so the first change will be to make this a module.
Are there any ressources on the net that tell a kernel hacker wannabe
how to:
- organize Makefiles etc. to fit into the kernel Makeprocess nicely
  (this setup had become rather complex over the years. Is it documented
  somewhere?)
- avoid common pitfalls.
- write a simple device driver.
Are changes from 1.2 -> 2.0 -> 2.2 concerning device drivers documented
somewhere?

Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.            --unknown source
