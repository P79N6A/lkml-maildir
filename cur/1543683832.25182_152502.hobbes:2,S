And with the fix posted it will just be called "numa-scheduler". It's
a simplification, as you noticed.

Hammer will just go for the other nodes, as it should, when the own
node is free. Then you can benefit of NUMA improvements in the load
calculation and later of smarter distribution across the
nodes. Reverting to SMP is a quick fix but for improvements we'll have
to get back to NUMA. So why not fix it now and stay with NUMA.

Yes.

Andi mentioned in his talk to follow that path, too. We'll have to
experiment a while with the ideas we currently have to get the initial
load balancing/ dynamic homenode issue solved, there's no "golden way"
right now. I'll post the stuff I mentioned in my talk soon, but want
to gain some experience with it, first.
