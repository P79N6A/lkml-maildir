I'm complaining about being quoted out of context and the animus against
unsupported preempt claims being directed against me.
Re-stating preempt's "ostensible purpose" is the purpose of the "vague
notion", not adding to the pile of speculation.
For the data, akpm has apparently tracked scheduling latency, so there
is a chance he actually knows whether it's serving its ostensible
purpose as opposed to having a large stockpile of overwrought wisecracks
and a propensity for quoting out of context.
