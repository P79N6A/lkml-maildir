I would use a WLAN-router or bridge.
I recently bought a DSL-router with WLAN functionality and after a 
little testing i realized that it also acts like a bridge. Any WLAN 
device can reach any wired device on the switch where i connected the 
WLAN-router.
No drivers, no hassle, just a wasted IP for reaching the web-interface 
of the router. ;-)
Altough i don't know if it is a standard feature or not, it just worked 
in my case. :-)
Pro:
- Easy to setup, use & change
Con:
- No direct control within the server
