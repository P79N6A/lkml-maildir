I almost forgot to mention, that in 2.2.3, the penguin logo displayed
on bootup has changed position. On 2.2.2 and previous, it was on the right
hand side, and now its jumped to the left. Any reason for this ?
Or is it a bug?
It's irritating, as it tends to get in the way of the boot messages,
forcing me to do a dmesg | less if I want to read something.
It looks a bit crap too, as theres a line of the scrolling buffer visible
above the penguin, then the penguin, then the rest of the buffer. Ugly..
I'm using a Matrox Millenium G200.
regards,
d.
