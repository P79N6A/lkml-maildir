I have no objection to this patch overall, or the use of non-arch 
specific names.
But there is one subtle thing you're overlooking here.  The x86_*_percpu 
operations are guaranteed to be atomic with respect to preemption, so 
you can use them when preemption is enabled.  When they compile down to 
one instruction then that happens naturally, otherwise they have to be 
wrapped with preempt_disable/enable.
Otherwise, being able to access a percpu with one instruction is nice, 
but it isn't all that efficient.  If you're going to access a variable 
more than once or twice, its more efficient to take the address and 
access it via that.
So, upshot, I think the default versions should be wrapped in 
preempt_disable/enable to preserve this interface invariant.
