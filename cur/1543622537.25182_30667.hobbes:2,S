Why is it locale-dependent?  All ISO9660 file times are stored as Gregorian
calendar dates regardless of who made them, and the target (UNIX file time)
isn't locale-dependent either.  Why would it affect the calculation if the
local system used the Muslim calendar?
You're probably right, but I just want to know why so I'll know for the
future.
Shouldn't there be a gregorian_date_to_unix_time() function in the kernel so
that every driver that needs such conversion can share that implementation?
It would keep date processing consistent and make it easy to spot date bugs.
