Wrong patch, do not apply.  Well, half of the patch is wrong.  The
Config.in part is correct.  I'm guessing that the changes made in
2.4.8-pre1 to include/hiddev.h didn't make it into -dj3
Try seeing if adding that patch to the -dj tree fixes things for you.
If you still have problems, let me know and I'll try to figure it out.
thanks,
