Subject: Very serious WRITE ERRORS with NFS in 2.2.14

Hello,
My home directory is NFS mounted from a SUN Sparc server 5.5.1, with lots of
patches :-).
Everything was OK with my 2.0.34 kernel. I have switched to a 2.2.14, and I
experience some very annoying write errors. There is no warning, or message from
my kernel, but some specific tools (gcc-2.95, zip) are creating bad files on my
NFS mounted directory. 
For example :
$ zip ../archive.zip *.c
$ unzip -tv ../archive.zip
 ...
  error:  invalid compressed data to inflate
Doing the zip on a non NFS partition works OK !!
Does somebody encountered the same problem.
My mount options :
server:/home/user /homes/user nfs   intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192  0  0
Thanks in advance.
