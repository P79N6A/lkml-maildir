Since I received many emails about the kernel not exposing the final
interface that is currently documented, and since Linus did not merge my
latest bits, I prepared a patch that will align the kernel to the latest
API :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/sys_epoll-2.5.49-0.58.diff
The latest API is documented here :
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.4
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_create.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_create.2
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_ctl.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_ctl.2
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_wait.txt
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll_wait.2
A few bits inside the man pages might change ( epoll.4 maybe heavily ) but
the API should be pretty much fixed right now. An access library is
available here :
