It is a funky driver for an embedded system. I can't imagine it ever  
being in the kernel tree, because not many people want to share 768M  
of contiguous physical memory.
I can post the source, but it really is a bunch of random stuff for  
am embedded application. We do make it available as part of our GPL  
source release to customers.
