Keep in mind that:
-LPC devices like the floppy controller, maybe enhanced parallel, etc. 
may have 24-bit DMA restrictions even if there is no physical ISA bus.
-Even in totally ISA and LPC-free systems, some PCI devices (like those 
that were a quick hack of an ISA device onto PCI) still have 24-bit 
address restrictions. There are other devices that have sub-32-bit DMA 
capabilities, like Broadcom wireless chips that only address 31 bits 
(although I think they are fixing this in the driver). Without the DMA 
zone there is no way to ensure that these requests can be satisfied.
So I don't think it is safe to make this conditional on ISA or even the 
ISA DMA API. Only if all devices on the system have addressing 
capability of a full 32 bits (or at least of all installed RAM) can this 
zone be removed.
