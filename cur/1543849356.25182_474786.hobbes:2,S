It looks like you did never really think about the problem or that you just 
don't know what you are talking about :-(
A typical UNIX standard installation has more than 3000 hard linked file name
entries in the root filesystem. There are many people who like to backup their 
root filesystem via mkisofs and all life CDs and install CDs depend on hard 
linked files.
But this seems to be a frequent way of dealing with implementation deficits:
define the problem to be not existant....

It seems that you did not think about the problem...
Wrong inode numbes do not open holes, they just create a garbage in garbage out
behavior, but they will not cause the OS to panic. 
The unfixed bugs in the Linux iso-9660 implementation on the other side allow 
me to create a CD that causes Linux to panic without taking me a long time.

This is just a junk statement, describe what you believe than can be done...
