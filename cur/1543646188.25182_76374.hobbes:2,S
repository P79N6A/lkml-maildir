Whatever.  I wouldn't call them 3.0 material yet - would you?

We have to code for the devices that are out there.  Big deal if we follow the spec to the letter - if Mr Average plugs in his USB device and it doesn't work, well, it doesn't work.  It's no good lecturing him on the spec.  I don't usually take that view, but when there are a large number of broken devices, what are the other options?

I certainly don't care about USB, I don't even have a USB port on my main box, but if you're saying that the current support is 3.0 material, then I totally disagree.
I started this thread because I'd originally thought that 1.x.x -> 2.x.x happened due to moving from a.out to elf as the standard binary format.  Linus corrected me on that one, and pointed out that it was major feature enhancements that dictate the major version number change.  Given that, I am not in any hurry to see it move to 3.0.0  :-).
John.
