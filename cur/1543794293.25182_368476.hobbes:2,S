Can this check for is_emergency_alloc be moved lower in __alloc_pages?
I don't see any reason why most __alloc_pages() calls, that succeed
easily in the first loop over the zonelist, have to make this check.
This would save one conditional test and jump on the most heavily
used code path in __alloc_pages().
