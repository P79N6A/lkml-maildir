Quite a bit :)
The -mm kernel has the memory controller code, which means the
mm/ directory is fairly different.  My patch set sits on top
of that.
Chances are that once the -mm kernel goes upstream (in 2.6.25-rc1),
I can start building on top of that.
OTOH, maybe I could get my patch series onto a recent 2.6.23.X with
minimal chainsaw effort.

Up to now I have only emailed out the patches. Since there is demand
for them to be downloadable from somewhere, I'll also start putting
them on
