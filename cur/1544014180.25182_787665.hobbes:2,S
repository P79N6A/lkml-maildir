Hello everyone,
Thanks for all of the comments so far.  I've pushed out a number of
fixes for btrfs mainline, covering most of the comments from this
thread.
* All LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION checks are gone.
* checkpatch.pl fixes
* Extra permission checks on the ioctls
* Some important bug fixes from the btrfs list
* Andi found a buggy use of kmap_atomic during checksum verification
* Drop EXPORT_SYMBOLs from extent_io.c
Unresolved from this reviewing thread:
* Should it be named btrfsdev?  My vote is no, it is extra work for the
distros when we finally do rename it, and I don't think btrfs really has
the reputation for stability right now.  But if Linus or Andrew would
prefer the dev on there, I'll do it.
* My ugly mutex_trylock spin.  It's a hefty performance gain so I'm
hoping to keep it until there is a generic adaptive lock.
The full kernel tree is here:

The standalone tree just has the btrfs files and commits, reviewers may
find it easier:
