Our mechanism also does less. It can not hide the distinction
between a blob of binary data and a structured document. This
distinction is necessary for good compound document behavior.
Dumb file problems:
* App developers need to create an internal namespace.
* Components that grow must suffer reallocation.
* The big bloated files this causes will need garbage collection.
Dumb directory problems:
* App developers WILL NOT agree to treat documents as files.
* (if they do: all app developers suffer extra work & bloat)
* Users will get very confused by directories that are documents.
* Tech support will want your head on a stake. (broken documents)

not very useful, and perhaps undesirable
(normal users never look at the content structure directly)

good - you are confused

good - this is CRITICAL

good - this is CRITICAL
(same sort of crash as above: broken links lose data)

not important, and perhaps undesireable
(this is silly: can /bin/bash be different...)

Oh, no problem at all. They serve a different purpose though.
