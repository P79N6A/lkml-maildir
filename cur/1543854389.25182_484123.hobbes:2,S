This usually means /dev/console doesn't exist.  With many of
today's distributions, this means you didn't boot with a
initrd properly set up to run with your newly built kernel.
If you don't want to create an initrd just to get yourself
a properly set up /dev, then you need to put on the root's
true /dev those few tmpfs /dev entries that might be used
during the boot process:
    mount --bind / /mnt
    cd /mnt/dev
    mknod null c 1 3
    mknod console c 5 1
    for i in $(seq 0 9); do mknod tty$i c 4 $i; done
    cd /
    umount /mnt
