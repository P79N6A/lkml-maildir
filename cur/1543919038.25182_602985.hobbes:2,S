Hey Dave,
The hack to use a socket and bind it to claim the port was just for 
demostrating the idea.  The correct solution, IMO, is to enhance the 
core low level 4-tuple allocation services to be more generic (eg: not 
be tied to a struct sock).  Then the host tcp stack and the host rdma 
stack can allocate TCP/iWARP ports/4tuples from this common exported 
service and share the port space.  This allocation service could also be 
used by other deep adapters like iscsi adapters if needed.
Will you NAK such a solution if I go implement it and submit for review? 
  The dual ip subnet solution really sux, and I'm trying one more time 
to see if you will entertain the common port space solution, if done 
correctly.
Thanks,
Steve.
