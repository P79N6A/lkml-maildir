Hi all,
I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations for reading 
material to introduce the Linux kernel, design & code.
I haven't found any online documentation that is as complete and 
introductory as I like (obviously the kernel code itself is complete, 
but... :-)
I've seen one book: Linux Kernel Programming by Beck (and about 6 
other authors).  It looks good, but before I shell out $50 I'd like 
to know if there are any other options.  Any suggestions would be 
appreciated.
Thanks, Eric
