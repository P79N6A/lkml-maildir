The key events above are just event labels, and it's up to the desktop
system how they are interpreted.  Most desktop systems like KDE or
GNOME should have the dedicated settings.  They can be set up to
change the multiple volumes as a single action, but I'm not sure about
the details.
Alternatively, you can assign "PCM" volume, which controls usually all
digital output (in software).
