    Hi all :)
    I recently upgraded to 2.4.27 and finally remove ISA support
(CONFIG_ISA is now not set). This may be important because the kernel
threads named 'usb-storage-0' and 'scsi_eh_0' are both stuck in a
very high address, namely e086e736 and e086d279. But my ksyms says
this:
[...]
e086b944  scsi_hostlist                     [scsi_mod]
e086b948  scsi_devicelist                   [scsi_mod]
e086b94c  scsi_hosts                        [scsi_mod]
e086b964  scsi_dma_free_sectors             [scsi_mod]
e086b968  scsi_need_isa_buffer              [scsi_mod]
    As far as I can tell, this means that both kernel threads are
stuck somewhere in the code of 'scsi_need_isa_buffer'. Does this mean
that I must set CONFIG_ISA? If the answer is yes: then why
CONFIG_SCSI doesn't depend on CONFIG_ISA? Is all that not related to
ISA in any way (I suppose this is the correct answer) and the problem
is just that both threads are stuck in a wrong address caused by
only-god-knows?
    I use scsi for my card reader, that works without problem
usually. Right now I cannot test if the problem was a loose cable,
bad insertion of the card, etc. but anyway that shouldn't cause
kernel threads to get stuck...
    Thanks in advance :) If anyone wants additional info, just tell.
I'm going to reboot ASAP to see if this problem is persistent or if I
just had bad luck.
