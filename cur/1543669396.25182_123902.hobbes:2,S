Subject: 2.5.67, 2.5-bk lock up with RH 9 and graphical log out.

I don't know if this should be considered a Red Hat problem or a kernel
problem, but here it is anyway.
With kernel 2.5.67 or 2.5-bk-current and Red Hat 9, if I try to do a
graphical log out from either KDE or Gnome, the test machine locks up
hard, not responding to pings, or alt-sysrq-anything. (and yes,
/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq is 1 and I "fixed" /etc/sysctl.conf, line 13)
The same lockup happens with ctrl-alt-backspace from KDE or Gnome.
Doing an /sbin/init 3 works fine.  Harsh way to log out however.
Subsequent cycles of startx and graphical "Log Out" do _not_ lock up
the box, but work just fine.
Needless to say, with the vendor kernel, everything works perfectly. 
Alt-sysrq-various behaves as expected. Ctrl-alt-backspace does not
lock up the box.
If I get time, I'll try some older 2.5.x kernels to see if this is a
recently introduced behavior.
