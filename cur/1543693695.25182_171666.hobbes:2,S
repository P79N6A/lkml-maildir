Hello every body
I bought a USB-DOCK of Sitecom(R) connectivty. The linux standard usb 
driver support the parallel printer driver, the 2 ps2 connectors and the 
USB-Hub. But the serial converter is not compatible with the linux 
generic USB-Serial driver.
I build a usb-serial driver from the source of the generic usb-serial 
driver, and it seems to work.
Now i'm looking for somebody to try this driver. Can somebody help me?
I created a patch for the kernel 2.4.22.
Thank you.
Marc.
