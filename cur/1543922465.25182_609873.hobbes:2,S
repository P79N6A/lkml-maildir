It does not matter whether Geode has 500 functions and RDC has 5. It
matters that we do _not_ want two different APIs which deal with the
same thing, where one can obviously be a subset of the other. So
either we can extend / rework the stuff that both parties are happy or
we are not going to merge either of them.
