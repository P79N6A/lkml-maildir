The current isdn LL-HL interface does not provide for accessing
b-channel data while no isdn connection is established. Thus, it won't
be possible to implement such a driver on top of the current LL-HL driver
interface. You would either need to extend the LL-HL-interface and modify
all HL drivers accordingly or to bypass the LL-HL-interface and hook directly
in a HL-driver of choice (i.e. HiSax).
It might also be possible to write such a driver on top of a HL-driver
which provides a CAPI interface. (There is even some experimental code
avaliable to add CAPI-support to HiSax, but I don't know whether this
implements all the CAPI features necessary for your driver semantics).
