malloc() is not a system call. It's not a kernel issue. If it does not
work as you expect, it's a (documentation) bug.
It uses brk(), which is a system call. bck() is well documented, and does
exactly what expected to do. It extends a process address space. No more,
no less.

"you"? this is not the libc mailing list. And BTW, *my* malloc works
exaclty as *I* expect. And it's the standard glibc one.
