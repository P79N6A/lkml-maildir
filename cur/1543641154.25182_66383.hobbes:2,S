I missed the original post - on which plattform do you want to run your
kernel? I had similar problems with versions around that time and it
turned out that it came from a change in the A19 initialisation code in
combination with some BIOSes. A fix for the AMD Elan family went into
2.4.18, but it may affect others as well.
