	I wasn't aware of this work.  This is very interesting.  Two
questions:
1) When does it failover?  Meaning, if I I/O to a disk, but someone
yanks the fibrechannel plug.  Does your multipath wait for a SCSI
timeout to redirect the I/O?
2) If so, have you considered trapping loop up/down events to handle
such a case?  Real users of multipath tech do not want to wait 90s for
failover.
