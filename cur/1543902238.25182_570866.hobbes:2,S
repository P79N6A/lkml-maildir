After that commit (+appArmor patchset) any guest image hangs the system 
completely as soon as started with kvm-29 userspace. Guest images works 
with "qemu-kvm -hda X.img -m 512 -no-kvm" works as expected
I cannot provide any more information for now causes system freezes at all and 
netconsole not works with ipw3945 (netconsole: eth1 doesn't support polling, 
aborting) but tomorrow i'll try with cable.
If needed you can find .config and dmesg from [1], if anything else needed 
please just say it...
