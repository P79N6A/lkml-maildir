I don't know if this helps, but I get the netscape (4.0.7) crashes on both
Linux 2.0.36 (stock RH 5.2 + X 3.3.3) and on some SGI O2s in a school lab. I
find that if I run netscape long enough, I will eventually get the crash, but
having multiple windows open causes it to happen more quickly. I'm not using
netscape for mail or news, only as a browser, and my Linux box is not even
connected to the internet, so I can get the crash just accessing files on my
hd.
