You will see a number of .gitignore updates until we get the kernel
covered as is. After that the .gitignore files will seldom see updates.
Also some of the patches even change things already to simplify stuff.
Look at last patch from Brian that ignores *.so in all the trees - this
covers all the architectures using vdso tricks.
And the typical developer does not want to use KBUILD_OUTPUT, that would
be cumbersome when debugging the kernel - so requesting all users to
start using KBUILD_OUTPUT (make O=...) is not an option.
