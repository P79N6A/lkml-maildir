I.E. with your new scheduler, priority levels actually have enough of an 
effect now that things that aren't reniced can be noticeably starved by 
things that are.
This is, in point of fact, progress.  If you nice X to -10, X will hog the CPU 
to update the display, potentially starving your audio output process enough 
to cause skips.  This is not a bug, this is what you asked the system to do.  
Don't Do That Then.

(Renicing X can even make the display jittery if the application can't 
promptly get CPU time to respond to redraw requests or mouse movement events 
because X is busy doing things like issuing more redraw requests and mouse 
movement events... :)
