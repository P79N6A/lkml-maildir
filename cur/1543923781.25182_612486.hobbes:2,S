Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes for 2.6.24-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some driver core bugfixes and tweaks for 2.6.24-rc1.  It fixes
the much-reported sysfs traceback when renaming network devices when
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is enabled.
There is also a documentation translation and typo fix, and some other
minor things.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
