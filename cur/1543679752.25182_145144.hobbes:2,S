Hi Guerrero,
I am having some hangs with the 2.4.20 kernel without isolatting the source
of the trouble.
Is there any strange message at /var/log/message ? How do you concluded that
is the IDE drive ?
In my linux box, it halts without any clue of what is going on. First I
thank that the trouble was with AIC7xxx and SCSI drives, because of a
correlation of large I/O and linux halt, but after a big help from Justin
Gibbs, when I upgraded the AICxxx module to the newer, the system hangs
without the old message: Locking max tag count...
