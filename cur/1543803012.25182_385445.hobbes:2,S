Hello,
I noticed (also thanks to discussion about DOS and NTFS) that suspend to ram
consumes a lot of battery power.
I'm using 2.6.15-git7 kernel now.
According to lspci I have:
0000:00:00.0 Host bridge
0000:00:01.0 PCI bridge
0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller (915GM)
0000:00:02.1 VGA compatible controller
0000:00:1b.0 High Definition Audio Controller 
0000:00:1d.0 USB Controller UHCI
0000:00:1d.1 USB Controller UHCI
0000:00:1d.2 USB Controller UHCI
0000:00:1d.3 USB Controller UHCI
0000:00:1d.7 USB Controller EHCI
0000:00:1e.0 PCI bridge
0000:00:1f.0 ISA bridge
0000:00:1f.1 IDE interface
0000:00:1f.3 SMBus Controller 
0000:01:00.0 Ethernet controller
0000:01:01.0 CardBus bridge
0000:01:01.1 FireWire (IEEE 1394)
0000:01:01.2 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro
0000:01:01.3 Memory Stick Bus
0000:01:01.4 Ricoh Co Ltd xD-Picture Card Controller
0000:01:02.0 Network controller
I have modules for both USB1.1, USB2.0, sound card, dri, both ethernet
controllers, cardbus, and IEEE1394. 
In normal situation, I load modules for: DRI, sound, USB1, USB2, ethernet
cotroller. Suspend-to-ram takes 2.8W. 
If I boot using init=/bin/bash i.e. not using any module, then suspend-to-ram
takes 1.6W (which is still a lot, it should taky 0.7W approx).
I do not know, how PCI devices disabling works. Does message:
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:01:00.0 disabled
have additional meaning, that device 0000:01:00.0 went into D3 state?
However, I have these messages in dmesg (if usual modules are present):
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:01:00.0 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1d.7 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1d.3 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1d.2 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1d.1 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1d.0 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1b.0 disabled
So, it looks like IRQ is not disabled for graphic and IDE, cardbus, firewire,
card reader. Is this OK?
