That sounds promising. I'll rework it and see how it looks, thanks.

Yes, indeed. I'll probably look at this after I get remount support
working.

D'oh! I noticed that in the journal replay code, but it didn't quite
register. Thanks for pointing it out. I'll think about that and make
sure to add it to my test scripts so it doesn't get overlooked.

Habit :)
I usually use ii, jj, etc as they are easier to grep for. However, not
linux style, I must admit. I'll change it.

Sorry, not sure if you are pointing something out or if this is a mailer
glitch. If the former, I'm afraid I don't understand.
