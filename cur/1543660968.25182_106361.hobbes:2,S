hi Richard,
You are true if the driver is a module. But i think the same case 
is not with
drivers present in the kernel image(when built with kernel). The 
position
in the kernel address space where the drivers are loaded is fixed. 
it can
change only if you recompile the kernel. correct me if i am going 
wrong
somewhere.
About ioctl, ioctls can return the required values from the 
driver. But if the
driver is present in the kernel (not as a module) where to find 
these
return values(in this case start & end addresses of the driver). 
Here i am
not getting the place or method to find the addresses.
it will be very helpful if someone could push me forward in 
correct direction.
Thank You.
Regards,
Nitin
