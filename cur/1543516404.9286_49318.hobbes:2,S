Try this one. I've added in Jeff's comments about having to mask the
base_address[] before passing it to ioremap() and a comment about needing a
unique dev_id for request_irq() as well.
Let me know if this doesn't apply cleanly. I'm not sure that I'm doing it
correctly.
I am using the source that RedHat distributes in RedHat 6.1 as my source
tree for 2.2.13. Since this is only the Documention directory I wouldn't
expect that to cause any problems.

  config space. You should use the values in the pci_dev structure as they might
  have been remapped by the kernel.
  
+    If your PCI device uses PCI I/O space, you need to use the check_region(),
+ request_region() and release_region() routines. These prevent devices from 
+ having conflicting I/O regions.
+ 
+    You use ioremap() to create a cookie mapping to your PCI device. The 
+ value from (struct pci_dev *) dev->base_address[] must be masked by either 
+ PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_IO_MASK or PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK before passing it 
+ into ioremap().
+ 
+    This cookie is passed to the readb(), readw(), readl(), writeb(), writew(), 
+ and writel() routines when accessing PCI space. You must always use these 
+ routines when accessing PCI space from the kernel. Not all architechures allow 
+ memory-mapped access to PCI memory from the kernel.
+ 
+    DMA device drivers should review the IO-mapping.txt file for information 
+ about converting between the various address spaces.
+ 
+    PCI interrupt routines are always SA_SHIRQ and should use the value from
+ (struct pci_dev *) dev->irq field for the interrupt number passed into 
+ request_irq(). Since it is a shared interrupt, you must also always pass in 
+ a unique dev_id to request_irq().
