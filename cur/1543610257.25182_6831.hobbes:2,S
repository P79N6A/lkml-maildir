Doug,
I have seen some problems with the rpm build and default install of your
kernel sources.
NWFS and the SCI drivers will **NOT** build against it since you post in a
linux and linux-up kernel for lilo during boot.  People using these drivers
who email me always have to do a "make distclean" to get stuff to build.  I
am very familiar with the kernel.h
changes you guys put in that are different from stock kernels, but despite
this, it's
far from "plug and play" for a customer building third party kernel modules
on your rpms.
I am not saying this is bad or anything, but it does require that the
customer A) have a
Linux consultant to do the installation or B) be a competent Linux
programmer.  Kind of
tough this to expect a secretary to do without a little help.
This is way off topic at this point.  This was originally related to BUG()
getting called from builds against a virgin source tree.  Alan Cox has asked
me to look into the code and determine just where the BUG() message is
getting generated from.  I am pursuing this at present.
Jeff
