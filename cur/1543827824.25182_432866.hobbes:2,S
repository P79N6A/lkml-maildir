So SPF followers must try talk their way out of responsibility for the
nonsense they create(d) or advocate(d). "I'm sure you can", "Your ISP
must", "You must not" and thereabouts don't work, because...

...RFC-2476 isn't a mandatory standard as in "every ISP must offer
submission service"

Perhaps if people stopped being so narrow-minded to think that looking
at the envelope were a good way to separate the chaff from the wheat, it
might work. Much sooner than killing accessbility and negating SPF
responsibility by trying to coerce people who live somewhere in the
outback and have no choice of ISP into changing ISP or other nonsense.
