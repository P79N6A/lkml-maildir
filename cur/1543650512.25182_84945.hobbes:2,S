Thank you very much Janet for doing performance and stability test.
Working with Andrew we agreed to remove the main hash table since, by
using in full the fcblist.c capabilities, it is not needed any more. Hash
allocation was a big Andrew concern because of its dimension and because
it was allocated with vmalloc() that might fail when fragmentation
increase. The new patch will have a reviewed locking behavior and will
introduce a slab allocator inside fs/fcblist.c. My plan is to release 0.16
today so that you guys can run regression test on it. To test the locking
"goodness" it should be run on an SMP system, with multiple copies of
ephttpd running on different ports, each one stressed either by httperf
or the sys_epoll HTTP blaster. Also, building an threaded application that
makes "bad use" of the interface might help in checking the API robustness
against every condition. Also, the usual performance test should be run to
check if we loose something along the path ...
