Subject: ACPI sleep states on Tyan Thunder K8W S2885

I can't seem to get my Tyan board (AMD 81x1 chipset) to go to sleep such
that wake-on-LAN will wake it back up.  On my other machines, when I
shutdown -h, it (presumably) puts the machine into S5 state
automatically, and WOL works like a charm; on this machine, shutdown -h
  puts the machine into an actual "off" state in which WOL won't wake it
back up.
Moreover, if I try to echo 5 > /proc/acpi/sleep with full debugging, I
get absolutely nothing in dmesg.
Here are the ACPI-related lines from my boot log (minus the lines
regarding ACPI routing of specific IRQ's):
PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
hpet_acpi_add: no address or irqs in _CRS
ACPI wakeup devices:
PCI1 USB0 USB1 PS2K GOLA GLAN GOLB SMBC AC97 MODM PWRB
ACPI: (supports S0 S1 S4 S5)
ReiserFS: hda5: found reiserfs format "3.6" with standard journal
ReiserFS: hda5: using ordered data mode
ACPI: 'PS2K' and 'PCI1' have the same GPE, can't disable/enable one
seperately
ACPI: 'GLAN' and 'PCI1' have the same GPE, can't disable/enable one
seperately
/proc/acpi/wakeup:
Device  Sleep state     Status
PCI1       4             enabled
USB0       4            disabled
USB1       4            disabled
PS2K       1             enabled
GOLA       4            disabled
GLAN       4             enabled
GOLB       4            disabled
SMBC       4            disabled
AC97       4            disabled
MODM       4            disabled
PWRB       1            *enabled
and /proc/acpi/sleep:
S0 S1 S4 S5
Furthermore, if I shut down from Windows, it *does* go into what I
presume is the S5 state, so this is a software problem, not hardware.
Any suggestions on debugging?
Cheers,
Kyle
