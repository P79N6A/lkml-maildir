Only Phoenix developers can answer this.
In principle not even cli is necessary because, all interrupts are
automatically disabled upon entry into SMM mode. The bios does mask
the PIC, though, probably because it is possible for SMI handlers to
reenable interrupts while in SMM mode. AFAIK, our BIOS does _not_
include such handlers, but Phoenix seems to have put in that code
so that it is possible to write them if desired. It appears that the
Phoenix programmers overlooked the fact that the PIC might be in poll
mode when they try to read the IMR. Our Bios people are trying to
contact Phoenix about this.

Can you tell me how the SMI code could correctly transparently reestablish
the 8259A state in the situation we are facing?
I can't think of an algorithm that would put the PIC in exactly the same
state that it was in before the SMI, not to talk about the time elapsed
during SMI, which easily comes up to a few 100 us on our system.

Oops - I will contact our hardware guys about this.
Thanks for your comments,
