Yes we are. The pool can only hold n bits. If it's full and we mix in
m more bits, we're losing m bits in the process.

Heh. That's actually a bug. Your mouse movement is only giving the
system a few hundred bits of entropy (by the current code's
measurements), but /dev/random will give out thousands. 
Note that above a certain velocity, mouse samples are back to back
characters on the serial port (or packets in the keyboard controller),
so most of the timing entropy is in the early acceleration or during
direction changes.

The kernel uses it internally for numerous things like sequence
numbers, syncookies, and UUIDs. So it doesn't take much to justify
exporting it..
