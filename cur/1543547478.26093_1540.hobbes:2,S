Hello all,
I've seen this with earlier versions, starting on my old laptop, a
Compaq Presario 1250.  But I'm now in the interesting position that my
only access to the machine is via ssh.  This is what I saw when I
booted:
U
LILO boot:
Loading 2.4.0-test7..........
Uncompr     g L.L      Ok, booting the k#ke
The "U" is actually a flashing green U.  And the hash mark is really a
musical note character.  It finished booting, but with no further
display, and I can still see the above.  There is no visible response
to the keyboard.
I had just figured out that the latest version of pcmcia-cs breaks the
SuSE network scripts, so this is the first time I've successfully
brought the machine up with network connectivity under a 2.4.0-test
kernel.
But I'm composing this e-mail while ssh'd into it.  So I have a pretty
good idea that the system is running well in every other respect.
I looked through dmesg and can't say I saw anything unusual.  I'll
send it along with any other information you'd like.  The screen may
not be happy, but I'm not seeing any particular reason I can't leave
the system like this indefinitely while attempting to sort this out.
Just tell me what to do.

There are no physicists in the hottest parts of hell, because the
existence of a "hottest part" implies a temperature difference, and
any marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to
run a heat engine and make some other part of hell comfortably cool.
This is obviously impossible.
