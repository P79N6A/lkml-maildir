There haven't been any Red Hat releases with a 1.3.x or 2.1.x kernel.
The Rawhide distribution may have used one, but that is specifically a
whole distribution that is alpha/beta test stuff (aka "bleeding edge").
And SLS wasn't the first distribution - MCC was came before it.  Don't
forget H.J. Lu's boot and root disks (they had all you _really_
needed!).  I remember being amazed at the single boot/root disk (way
before compressed ramdisks and the like).  It even had vi and color_ls!

There's always someone that's been around here longer, unless your name
is Linux Torvalds! :-)
