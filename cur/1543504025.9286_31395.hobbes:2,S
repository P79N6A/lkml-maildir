Well, I was always good with puzzles like that, but I didn't
figure it out on my own...  Back in Grade 4 our teacher got a
group of us together that were interested in solving the cube,
and showed us how it was done.  I can still solve that sucker in
under 3 minutes...  ;o)
I've considered writing an application for Linux that solves the
cube - perhaps as a screen saver, but possibly as a virtual
rubics cube too...
Maybe interface it with stepper motors, etc.. to a real cube
too... ;o)
