Software deployed /= configured & enabled.
One of the main problems with the TCP MD5 option is that it requires a
password which has to be negotiated by the peers.  This adds a
non-trivial management burdern.

If the packet is still handled by a real CPU (which is very likely the
case given the complexity of the protocols involved), it will still
overload.

In this case, the anti-spoofing has to happen at the other side, to
protect you.  There is an anomaly in Cisco ACLs you could exploit to
implement this without too much management overhead, *but* filtering
on core routers still problematic.
However, experience tells us that there is little incentive for others
to invest some work to protect you, and that it doesn't happen in
general. 8-(
