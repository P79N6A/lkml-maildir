theoretical question:
what would happen if i flashed a linux kernel into the BIOS of a
recent pc motherboard, given that the EEPROM is big enough to hold
the kernel. 
would it work. the kernel already can initialise most motherboard
chipsets, eg PIIX, VP3, so how much stuff does the bios do that the
kernel can't? is there any really low level stuff that needs to be
tweaked, eg memory timings, that linux couldn't do?
regards,
