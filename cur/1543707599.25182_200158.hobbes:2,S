You don't really need to go to such extremes.  Samba can use dnotify,
and run with caching and great performance as long as nobody touch
the files in other ways.  There is no need to _enforce_ it though,
samba can cope by invalidating the cache on those rare occations
the files are accessed in other ways. It won't happen often, because:
1. Linux/nfs people have no business in a directory full of
   windows .dll's and .exe's
2. On a corporate server you simply tell people to stay out.
   nfs may export another set of homedirs for the unix people.

Thanks to dnotify even the "linux priority" setup will be able to benefit
from a cache.  Particularly if we can get a dnotify that doesn't trip
when samba is the one making changes.
