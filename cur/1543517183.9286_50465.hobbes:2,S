grep end_that_request /proc/ksyms.  If it finds nothing then your
symbols are not being exported.  It it finds
end_that_request_..._Rxxxxxxxx then your kernel was compiled with
kernel symbols (genksyms) but your modules were not.  Compile both
kernel and modules with the same options.  Also make sure that the new
modules are installed correctly and you are picking up the correct set
of modules, not some old set from initrd or elsewhere.
