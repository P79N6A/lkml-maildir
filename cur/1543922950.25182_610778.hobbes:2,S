Yes, I do - I'd been tripping over it once every couple weeks,
and I finally figured out how to hold my mouth right so that it
fails (almost) every time.
The below 3rd try takes on your suggestion of just invalidating
no matter what the retval from the direct_IO call.  I ran it
thru the test-case several times and it has worked every time.
The post-invalidate is probably still too early for async-directio,
but I don't have a testcase for that;  just sync.  And, this
won't be any worse in the async case.
