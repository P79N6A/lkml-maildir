I'm not going to defend or attack arch since I haven't used it enough. I 
will say that darcs largely does suffer from the same problem that you 
describe since its fundamental unit of storage is individual patches 
(though it avoids the tarball issue). This is why David Roundy has 
indicated his intention of eventually having a per-file cache:
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/1/message/24317/flat
You could then make the argument that if you have a per-file 
representation of the history, why do you also need/want a per-patch 
representation as the canonical format, but that's been argued plenty on 
both the darcs and arch mailing lists and probably isn't worth going 
into here.
