Hi,
I have recently been trying the 2.6.0-test kernels on an up-to-date Red Hat 9 system (Dual Xeon, 2 GB RAM, Tyan 7505 motherboard).  Being lazy :-) I downloaded arjanv's source RPMs and built from those.  These RPMs apply 2 small patches, one framebuffer related and one implements a noninteractive "make oldconfig", otherwise the 2.6.0 source is untouched.
Compilation of the initial 2.6.0-test2 with gcc 3.2 (Red Hat released version) (while running 2.4.21) went perfectly.  I booted the new 2.6.0-test2 and I have to say I never want to go back to 2.4!  Desktop responsiveness is **much** improved - superb job, guys!.
However...  When I tried to compile 2.6.0-test2 again, (running under 2.6.0-test2) I get irreproducible internal compiler errors or segmentation faults.  I have tracked this down to the use of "make -j4" during the build.  If I disable the multiple job compilation, everything works.  If I so much as use "make -j2" I get the errors again.
Same thing happens with 2.6.0-test4.  I tried upgrading gcc to 3.3.1 (Rawhide rpm) and this has made no difference.  I have not yet tried this with anything but the smp kernel, btw.
So... What am I looking at here?  Problem with hardware? kernel? gcc?  Any comments and suggestions gratefully received!!
