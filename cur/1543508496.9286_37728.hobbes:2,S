That sounds like a loading problem on the memory bus.  My suggestion is to
get ahold of DIMMs that have fewer chips (ie single sided, not double like
most 128MB units), possibly a different brand of memory.  Check with
Microstar if they've tested with 3*128MB DIMMs of the type you're using --
it's possibly a legitimate hardware incompatibility.

Yeap!  But there aren't many q's about K7s yet.  I normally get to them
via the links on
