I also have problems with /dev/audio.  On my other sound cards,
cat'ing a .au file to /dev/audio works well.  On the ES1370, I 
get noise.  16-bit play seems fine.  Using vplay (modified to 
expand uLaw to 16-bit) or esdplay I can play the file fine.
I think the driver is not properly expanding uLaw or such.
Cheers,
