I already have the latest bios according to Asus site. 
I sent a complain to Asus support, we'll see...
Those fixes can still be found somewhere ? I'd like to play with them.

I tried with the P-state driver compiled in with the Athlon driver, or
only with the Athlon driver without P-state. The result is the same,
when I try to set a governor through sysfs the system freezes and a
hard reset is required.
However without P-state driver the above message disappers.
So I'm getting neither scaling or throttling... it's not much a surprise
that the battery was discharging at that rate...
