Yes, that is a problem. We could do some switchover from PIT to HPET (or
from legacy to IOAPIC IRQs) after APICs are initialized, though I don't
like the idea very much. Best would be to remove the dependence on the
timer interrupt ticking so early. Or moving APIC detection earlier.

Well, the APIC should have quite a number of free pins, which means that
the HPET shouldn't need to share an interrupt. Regarding lost and late
delivered timer interrupts - that happens nevertheless with drivers
disabling interrupts for a long time. The kernel timekeeping code can
cope with that.
