I don't have all the details at hand, but it included syscalls and
scheduler points amongst others.

Or maybe people start looking at it not knowing whether the want to
pursue it to the end for their product.

There's a word for that: *plonk*
Maybe the code was used to evaluate it as an option, maybe they realized
it wasn't worth using in the end, maybe they decided they could make it
work. Maybe the LTT mailing list had been *dead* for 18 months by the
time? You know, reading C code isn't that hard, and it didn't state
anywhere in the LTT license that one is required to take out a paying
contract with a certain Mr. Yaghmour just to be allowed to compile the
code.

You intend to handle inline assembly how? You plan to handle the issue
of debugging the code when the markup is present how?

And it doesn't address the following issues:
a) The static community providing actual evidence that dynamic tracing
   is noticably slower.
b) It will not be enabled per default in vendor kernels so in practice
   the information will not be available anywhere, only in debug
   kernels.
c) The point that we will end up with markups all over the place to
   satisfy everybody's needs.

Everything has performance limitations, you keep running around touting
that static is the only thing thats not a problem. Now show us the
numbers!

Oh so bringing fact into a discussion is not allowed. Karim, maybe you
should try using some real arguments. What I am saying about the ia64
implementation is that there are limitations but I am also saying they
can be fixed, it's an implementation issue, not a problem with the
concept.
The problems pointed out with LTT are *conceptual*, but of course you
keep ignoring the facts and refusing to provide real numbers.
Says it all really ....
