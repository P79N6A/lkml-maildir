Hi Jeff,
I'm submitting a set of bug fixes for inclusion in 2.6.21.
The patches are built against Linus'git tree.
Here is a brief description:
- Ensure that the on-board TCAM's active region size is always greater 
than 16
- the driver now recognizes NIC only adapters
- tighten the MAC hang workaround
- bump up firmware version
Cheers,
Divy
