RT tasks are always interactive aren't they?  (I'll check)
Anyway, this is definitely a large part of the problem with the ssh to
busy server, but a complete block of interactive tasks isn't quite the
right solution.  With an SMP kernel, my desktop appeared to be fine, but
a quick spin with UP kernel isn't looking quite so good.  This needs
more investigation.
