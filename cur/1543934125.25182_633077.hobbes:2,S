yeah, i'd prefer that. People might be willing to enable an experimental 
video driver but not an experimental ATA driver. This global-scope "all 
or nothing" CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is totally pointless and _no_ distro 
uses it in practice.
If it's a pure label via which you want to document things as 
experimental then i'd agree with adding the "Warning: experimental code" 
to the help section of all the affected Kconfig entries (that way people 
would be more likely to actually read that label.)
but i think your suggestion of per-subsystem and/or per-driver quality 
levels is superior to that.
