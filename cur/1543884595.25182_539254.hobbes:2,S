The last several kernels I have built all have the following warning in them:
WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:start_kernel from 
.text between 'is386'
 (at offset 0xc0401171) and 'check_x87'
WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text: from .text 
between 'rest_init' (at off
set 0xc0401406) and 'try_name'
WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.data: from .text 
between 'probe_bigsmp' (at
offset 0xc0402032) and 'init_apic_ldr'
WARNING: vmlinux - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:find_unisys_acpi_o
em_table from .text b
etween 'acpi_madt_oem_check' (at offset 0xc0402244) and 'enable_apic_mode'
and this goes on with different variables for 18 lines.
Is this something I should be worried about?
I frankly dont understand what the message is trying to say.
