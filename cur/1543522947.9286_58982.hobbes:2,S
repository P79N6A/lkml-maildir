You say a few times "shared slot", as if the ISA and PCI slots are
physicly connected on the mother board.  This isn't really the case, it
is just called a shared slot because ISA cards sit one was and PCI sit
the other, so they both end up opening through the same whole in the
back of the case.  The closest the ISA bus gets to the PCI bus is
through an ISA/PCI bridge chip.
While I have never seen this problem myself, I would guess that it is
closer to being related to actual position on the PCI bus.  Different
PCI slots get different IRQ assignments.  Or more likely, you said this
board has 5 PCI slots plus AGP, it probally has a PCI to PCI bridge in
there that may not be functioning correctly.
You also said that the first PCI slot should not be used if there is an
AGP card install.  What is your reasoning behind that?
I have a machine with 1 AGP, 4 PCI, 3 ISA (one of the PCI/ISA is
shared).  I have an AGP video card, a PCI video capture card (in the
slot next to the AGP because they are ribbon cabled together), a PCI
sound card, a PCI nic, and a PCI SCSI card.  Then an ISA modem and an
ISA sound card (that also has a SCSI controller on it).  I have no
problems at all.
