I noted the same thing on my Tulip DC21140 on 2.2.2 the other day.  I got the
EEPROM not present problem.  A reboot did not fix it.  Powercycling did not
work either.  Taking the card out and swapping PCI slots did work, though.  I
attribute the flakiness to the momentary loss of blue smoke. FWIW, I'm using a
Shuttle-569 motherboard.

  Here's the relevant info
from the system logs:

present, 00 4c 69 6e 75 79, IRQ 0. 
Feb 20 00:18:56 spoke kernel: eth1:  Missing EEPROM, this interface may not work
 correctly!

And another:
