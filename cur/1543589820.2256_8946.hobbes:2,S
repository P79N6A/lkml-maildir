Better yet, seems to me, its own type. Say: typedef unsigned long io_ref_t;
It's already done for dma_addr_t, and this seems like an analogous case.
The bigger job would be to fix all the direct dereferences (a 
worthwhile thing, I guess; a quick scan shows at least a few), as 
well as to fix uncast assignments of ioremap(). Or ideally to get rid 
of the casts (most that I see are casts to unsigned long) and type 
the receiving buffer appropriately.
It'd be a big job. And Linus further suggests that ioremap's first 
argument is an architecture-specific object, not necessarily either a 
physical CPU address or a PCI address (though it's typically both in 
many (most?) i386 implementations). Now *there'd* be a cleanup.
