If I'm understanding this (and reading the code) correctly, this would
allow UML to specify that, for a given process, it should have a page of
its choosing mapped into the vsyscall area.  Correct?
If so, I can go along with this.  It makes vsyscalls virtualizable, and thus
available to UML, which needs them more than the other arches :-)
The one suggestion I'd make is to make it per-mm rather than per-task and 
put it in switch_mm rather than switch_to.
