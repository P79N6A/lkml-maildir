Yeah, ("software"/"hardware"/"disabled") has been the other dropdown list in 
my BIOS (i remember now;) however, it's been 'disabled' as I touched my host 
first, and playing around didn't help *yet". although here, the BIOS 
reference book just didn't talk about this area either.
I'll try once again, thx all ;)
