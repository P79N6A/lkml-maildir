It is not strong enough in C unfortunately. It is still legal 
to change const variables, so the compiler has to take that into
account and it is hard for global variables. C++ is better here.

Only when the functions are inlined
(but it is much better at that than it used to be, gcc 3.4 can even
inline across multiple files and order doesn't matter anymore)
