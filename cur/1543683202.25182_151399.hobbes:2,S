Interesting...I haven't thought of SNMP.

It is just easier to have everything 64-bits.

Agreed, however if we are going to change some counters, we should do it for 
all of them. (Btw, /proc is not the only point where users can get stats.... 
there is also /sys and something else...I can't remember now...)
