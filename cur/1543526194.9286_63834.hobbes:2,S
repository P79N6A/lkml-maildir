Not recently. First order of bussiness when setting up Solaris is to get
rid of vold, and install mtools. After gcc and bash, obviously ;-)

It used to fail horribly, until I got fed up. Nowadays I indulge in Linux
on my SPARC.

Pop in a floppy that you want to format. Oops, was formated with MSDOS, no

ESP required, minimum. The opcode RUM (Read User's Mind) hasn't been
implemented, AFAIK.

That is the part that should _not_ be required at all. Going half the way
here is worse than not even starting down that road, IMVHO.
