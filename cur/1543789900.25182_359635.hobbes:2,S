I've noticed that between 2.6.14-rc2 and 2.6.14-rc5 mlock() and 
mlunlock() have broken.
a call to mlock() to lock pages is granted, and the pages are locked, 
but never
unlocked, even when munlock() is manually called or at process rundown.
No problems under 2.6.13 or up to 2.6.14-rc2. But sometime after -rc2 it 
goes BANG
and the machine gets very unhappy. If you look at "swapon -s" you see 
more and more swap
space is used until there is no physical memory left, then things really 
get unhappy.
