Usage of MMX inside the Linux kernel is like the usage of FP inside
the Linux kernel:  Can be done after jumping complex hoops, BUT NOT
RECOMMENDED... (MMX in intertwined with FP hardware, after all.)
You have to do lots of the MMXes in order to win after amortizing those
necessary hoops...  RAID-5 code does XOR via MMX code, under some 
conditions.  ... where that happens to become a win.
