Subject: sysfs root link count broken in 2.6.22-git5

Hi Tejun, hi Greg,
I'm running 2.6.22-git5 and noticed that the link count of the sysfs
root is broken:
$ ls -ld /sys
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jul 15 12:27 /sys
sysfs is mounted, the link count should be 11, and is with kernel
2.6.22.1. find(1) complains about the bad link count.
I suppose this is an unexpected side effect of the big sysfs changes
that went in 3 days ago. Do you have any idea what can be wrong and how
to fix it, or do you want me to perform a bisection?
Thanks,
