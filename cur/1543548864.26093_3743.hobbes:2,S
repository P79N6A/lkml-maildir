That's OK by me, nobody is stopping anyone from doing that.  I'd welcome it.

Nobody is proposing that BK is the only tool people could use.  The PPC kernel
folks have been using BK and then running "bk export -tpatch" to send Linus
patches.  It has been working for quite some time.  "bk import -tpatch" works
too.

So in other words, you are saying "BK is not free" and you haven't even
read the license.  That's pretty lame, if true.   You ought to at least
read it.  
A surprising number of formerly disagreeing people read the license
and decide it's actually pretty cool.  We put a lot of thought into
protecting your rights.  Did you know that if BitMover goes out of
business BK becomes GPLed?  Did you know if we stop maintaining the
openlogging servers, BK becomes GPLed?  Did you know that single user
repositories require neither money or the logging (and you can make
multiple people appear as one)?  Do you know that we routinely grant
waivers to people who have legit needs for !openlogging but no money?
