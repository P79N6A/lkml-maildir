Suggestion from the s390 front was to explicitly pass high and low part
of pos as two arguments.  A bit ugly too, but should work fine as well
and it avoids the user pointer dereference.  What do you think about this?

Well, avoiding the compat wrapper altogether unfortunately isn't going
to work because struct iovec looks different in 32 and 64 bit.

Args are passed on the stack, not in registers.

Yep, it is a separate bugfix.  Spotted by Christoph while reviewing v1,
but there are no other dependencies to this patch series.
