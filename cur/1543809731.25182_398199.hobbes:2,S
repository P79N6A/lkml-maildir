I am not refusing useful changes but I of course refuse to apply changes that
will or even may cause problems in the future.
cdrtools and libscg are a serious project and are maintained in a way that tries
to _plan_ all interfaces in a way that allows to upgrade interfaces for at 
least 10 years without a need for incompatible changes.

I like to have things orthogonal, but it seems that most people in LKML
do not understand implicit constraints from requiring orthogobality.

Sorry, the way to access SCSI generic via /dev/hd* is deprecated. If ide-scsi
ir removed, then a clean and orthogonal way of accessing SCSI in a generic
way is removed from Linux. If Linux does nto care about orthogonality of 
interfaces, this is a problem of the people who are responbile for the related
interfaces.

This is another construction side in Linux.
In 1997, I did cleanly write dowen what exact features are missing to allow 
Linux to be used to _develop_ SCSI user space programs. I did even send a patch
for sg.c to the Linux folks. This patch extends the sg SCSI Generic interface
in a source AND binary, up AND downwards compatible way.
This patch has been rejected for unknown reasons and the fact that the source 
code fond in official Linux release has been changed in an incompatible way, it 
is impossible to apply it now.
My patch did enable sg.c to return more error/status information back to the 
user (e.g. the SCSI status byte) _and_ it defined a way to return DMA residual
counts to the user. If Linux still does not even have the DMA residual count 
internally available, this is a proof that nobody with sufficient SCSI know how
is willing to work on the Linux SCSI layer.
