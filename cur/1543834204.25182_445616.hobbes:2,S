Hey guys,
I recently got the suspend to disk working and suspend to memory working
thanks to many of you.  Whenever I suspend to disk and resume, the
middle mouse button on my thinkpad x60s no longer works for scrolling or
for pasting.  I either have to reboot, or suspend to memory and resume.
 Therefore:
Initial Boot: working
Suspend to disk -> resume: not working
Suspend to memory -> resume: working
To fix it for now, i simply suspend to memory and resume after resuming
a suspend to disk.
Anyone else experience this?
Thanks!
George
