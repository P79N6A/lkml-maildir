This is not 100% true: the squashfs layout _has_ been changed in V4, in
response to review comments from the Linux kernel community on V3.3/V3.4.

AFAIK, all existing users use pre-V4. Let's hope this is going to change soon.
Apart from the use for backups (old ones have to be read using e.g. unsquashfs
now), I think this is OK: in most situations (embedded, Live CDs), the kernel
and the file system image are generated together (this is what e.g. OpenWRT
does).

So if staging would have existed +one year ago, we should probably have
included squashfs 3.3 at that time, and just have moved it to fs/ once the V4
layout was finished?
