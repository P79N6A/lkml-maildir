The best place to start is /proc/filesystems   This lists all the
filesystem types that the kernel knows about.
When you compliled the kernel did you enable NTFS as an inline part
of the kernel "Y" or a loadable module "M"?
If it's part of the kernel, then you should copy the kernel to /boot
edit /etc/lilo.conf, run lilo and reboot.
If you're using modules, then as root, "make modules_install" from
the kernel source tree and "modprobe ntfs".  If that succeeds then
"lsmod" should show something like:
    Module    Size  Used by
    ntfs     47152   0  (unused)
If this doesn't help, try reading the Kernel HOWTO:
