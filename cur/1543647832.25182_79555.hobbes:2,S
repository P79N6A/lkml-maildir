On the contrary, the percentage of non-working PL-2303 opens has now
gone from 50% to somewhere in the 5-15% range (rough guess). IOW, it's
working better than my previous patch.
FWIW, I'm seeing some "sleeping function called from illegal context"
oopses, but I didn't see if those were happening with my old patch. I'll
test with your latest batch of USB changes later (after they get merged
by Linus, most likely).
