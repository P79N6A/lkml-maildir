Which is bad, since I'm changing the same part as well.

Why, do you think, does one submit a bug-fix?
I did not (knowingly) change the (broken!) write-support - I submitted a
number of fixes to the read-support in order to at least get THAT PART
into a more stable state.
The QNX4 filesystem was so broken it should IMHO never have entered
2.2.x - since you have it enabled, you ought to know that it was pretty
unusable up till now (but as of 2.2.15pre3 you can at last READ from a
QNX fs all right)!
BTW, why do you insist on having QNX write-support enabled in your
kernel?
