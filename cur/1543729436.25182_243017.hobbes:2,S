Observe the following, from fs/proc/base.c:
static int proc_pid_cmdline(struct task_struct *task, char * buffer)
{
	int res = 0;
	unsigned int len;
	struct mm_struct *mm = get_task_mm(task);
	if (!mm)
		goto out;
	if (!mm->arg_end)
		goto out;	/* Shh! No looking before we're done */
 	len = mm->arg_end - mm->arg_start;
 
	if (len > PAGE_SIZE)
		len = PAGE_SIZE;
 
	res = access_process_vm(task, mm->arg_start, buffer, len, 0);
	// If the nul at the end of args has been overwritten, then
	// assume application is using setproctitle(3).
	if (res > 0 && buffer[res-1] != '\0') {
		len = strnlen(buffer, res);
		if (len < res) {
		    res = len;
		} else {
			len = mm->env_end - mm->env_start;
			if (len > PAGE_SIZE - res)
				len = PAGE_SIZE - res;
			res += access_process_vm(task, mm->env_start, buffer+res, len, 0);
			res = strnlen(buffer, res);
		}
	}
	mmput(mm);
out:
	return res;
}
The command-line arguments are being fetched from the process address
space, i.e. simply editing argv[] in userspace will have the desired
effect. Though this code is butt ugly.
