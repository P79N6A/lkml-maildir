Probably the easiest would be to add to the lock struct a pointer to
the task_struct and the EIP when it gets the lock, and clear them when
it releases the lock.  That way, when you see processes blocking on the
lock you can use crash or other tool to examine the lock and see which
process got the lock and also where.
