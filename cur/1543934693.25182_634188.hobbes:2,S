We shouldn't panic in 'default'. First, we'll never hit this case, and
if we do then we can be sure that the fault is not due to a probe. So
instead of singlestepping we'll let the kernel handle it. If it cant,
it'll panic/die() for us. I'll try to cleanup this case and
incorporate these suggestions in a separate patch, as u suggested.
