Big things should have big names. That's why "u8" is u8, because it's not 
just physically small, it also has very little semantics associated with 
it.
I want those variable declarations to stand out, and make people 
understand that this is not just a variable, it's a structure, and it may 
be taking up a noticeable amount of space on the stack, for example.
That's the main issue for me. I don't personally care so much about trying
to avoid dependencies in the header files that can also be problematic.  
That's probably partly because I use fast enough machines that parsing
them a few extra times doesn't much bother me, and circular requirements
tend to be rare enough not to bother me unduly.
So the thing is a big red warning sign that you're now using a complex 
data structure, and you should be aware of the semantics that go with it.
