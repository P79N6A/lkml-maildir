You must not disable preemption when entering sock_sendmsg no matter
sk->priority. disabling preemption inside sock_sendmsg is way too late
so even if you have such preemption bug in sock_sendmsg, it won't help.
you would need to disable preemption in the caller before doing the
kmap_atomic if something. And again that is a preemption bug.
Not to tell you'd need to allocate a big pool of atomic kmaps to do
that, and this would eat hundred megs of virtual address space since
it's replicated per-cpu. This is has even less sense, those machines
where the highmem deadlock triggers eats normal zone big time.
Really, the claim that it can be solved with atomic kmaps doesn't make
any sense to me, nor the fact the sock_sendmsg will not schedule if
called with GFP_ATOMIC. Of course it must not schedule if it can be
called from an irq with priority=GFP_ATOMIC, but this isn't the case
we're discussing here, an irq implicitly just disabled preemption by
design and calling sock_sendmsg from irq isn't really desiderable (even
if technically possible maybe with priority=GFP_ATOMIC according to you)
because it will take some time.
