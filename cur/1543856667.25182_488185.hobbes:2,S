Right now, it's solely dependent on -rt, but the basic mechanisms of how
it works is pretty much the same as lockdep. Parts of it should be
moveable across to regular kernels. The only remaining parts would be
altering the lock structure (spinlock, mutex, etc...) to have a pointer
that it can use to do the statistical tracking. If it's NULL then it's
dunamically allocated and handled differently and allocated when the
lock is contended against.
There's other uses for it as well. Think about RCU algorithms that need
to spin-try to make sure the update of an element or the validation of
it's data is safe to do. If an object was created to detect those spins
it'll track what is effectively contention as well as it is represented
in that algorithm. I've seen an RCU radix tree implementation do something
like that.

I hate the notion of a search, so I directly set the pointer to a
object that's statically defined. It means that the object is directly
connected to what is suppose to backing it without doing a runtime
search.  When that's done, all of the numbers from the second column
get moved to the third.

There's minimal runtime overhead I believe since it's only doing an
atomic increment of the stats during the slowpath before the thread
is actually shoved into a wait queue. That's something that happpens
seldomly.
