They clearly don't care about exactness; they msleep_interruptible and
throw away the return value, so they don't know how long they slept
before they got a signal.
__must_check treatment for msleep_interruptible, anyone?  On the one hand,
that's 136 new warnings.  On the other hand, that's 136 places wheree
we may as well *delete the call* to msleep_interruptible.  Since it can
return immediately, the code must be prepared to deal with that ... right?
