Yes, the machine is in production, and for that it, it needs vserver. The
fact it is in production also makes it a tad hankala awkward to test
different options, at least the most experimental ones.

Neither do I. Of course it could be memory corruption caused by vserver in
different part of kernel, but the fact that the symptoms are so consistent,
make me think that is unlikely. But not impossible.

That is a good idea, if only I could boot the box at will and reliably
reproduce the problem. While it took less than ten minutes to trigger it the
first time, it took more than five hours the first time. 
I will try to reproduce the problem on different setup first, and if I can
do that, I'll try your suggestion.

Correct. This is PII 266MHz, no SMP.

Sounds sane, although the raid array was not in degraded state at any stage
and no raid rebuild aver triggered.

Ok, as said, this is UP.

I will try to contruct a similar setup on another machine.
