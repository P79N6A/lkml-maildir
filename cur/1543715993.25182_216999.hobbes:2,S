Okay, I tried that before and I still ran into problems.  Just to be sure,
I grabbed 2.6.6-rc3 and tried your suggestion.  The resulting stack trace
is at the end of this message.  I can't explain how we get from
netif_receive_skb to anywhere up the stack, though.  Perhaps you'll have
better luck with it.
Note that this is alt-sysrq-t output, so the first bits of stack you see
are not relevant.  What counts is everything after the Badness in
local_bh_enable.
mpm> My point about deferring still stands, as when we're dumping an oops,
mpm> we can't really expect that we'll ever get to a process context.
Sure, but you can explicitly flush the queue in such a circumstance, though
this is still not an ideal solution.
