	Right. I can't imagine a way in which this could happen for TCP without a
bug. For other protocols, it's not so far fetched. For UDP, which is defined
as lossy, I could imagine an implementation that changed its mind about
accepting a packet due to memory demands.

	SuS2 says that 'read' behaves like 'recv' with no flags for a socket. SuS2
says that for a socket, "If no messages are available at the socket and
O_NONBLOCK is not set on the socket's file descriptor, recv() blocks until a
message arrives."

	At the time you return from poll. This says nothing about any later time.

	This brief comment is not meant to be thorough. In fact, it says nothing
about error conditions and implies that it's wrong to return POLLIN for an
error.

	When you code to a standard, your code must not fail under any conditions
permitted by the standard. Failing to set your file descriptors non-blocking
when you never want to block depends upon behavior not guaranteed.
	Unfortunately, none of the standards provides sufficiently clear statements
about this behavior. In fact, I can't even find any standard that says it's
correct to signal POLLIN when there's an error.
