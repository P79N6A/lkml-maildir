Ok.
That pretty much sucks, as it makes it pretty much inpossible to strace a
normal fork() on SMP machines.
Sounds like the correct fix is not vfork()-related at all, but rather a
flag to clone() to set "trace child process", so that the new child starts
out stopped and traced. And some way for strace to get at the child pid.
