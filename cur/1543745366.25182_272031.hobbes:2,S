Agree, but on a conceptual level, this is allowing the arch to swipe pages 
arbitrarily out from under the nose of the generic page allocator.  Plus, the 
code that's being bypassed has to be implemented in some form in the arch.  
That's not my concern, or yours, necessarily, but it does suggest that the 
interface is being abused.
