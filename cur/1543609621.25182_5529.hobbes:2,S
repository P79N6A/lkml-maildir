I shouldn't be the authoritative answer on this, but to start with:
a. You don't provide enough info on the hardware configuration:
	a. are all of the drives on one SCSI controller?
	b. is there only one PCI?
	c. since you mention "CPUs", how many, and which ones
	d. which chipset?
	e. what was used for the benchmark?
	f. which hardware raids were tested?
b. Your mentioned limit (40MB/sec) sounds like it is really a
   memory<->bridge<->PCI<->controller bandwidth limit - this is about what I
   get from a SCSI-3 alone on 33MHz bus (I use SCSI 3 for system disk, SCSI 2
   for audio/CDRW/tape drive).
c. Based on the statement that the "CPUs were almost idle", it sounds like
   the limit is outside the OS. If you are trying to setup a disk server then
   you should check into multiple PCI busses @ 66MHz, and multiple disk
   controllers.
