Please CC: me as I am not on the list.
I built the module manually precisely because I did not want to rebuild
the entire kernel and module set just to get this one module.
Perhaps I do not understand the correct approach to building individual
modules, on an existing tree.
What's the documented, correct approach to only building a single
module, starting with menuconfig, such that it will happily fit in with
the currently running kernel and modules?  I notice that many
drivers/modules happily include the correct gcc incantation (in comment)
for doing exactly this, and many do not.
And finally, back to my original question, is it a mute point?  Is the
softdog an Intel-only thing?
Thanks,
josh
