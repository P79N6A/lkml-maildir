I called you the VFS maintainer ("whether you like it or not" I think I
said. Although I can't find the message right now).
Now, that obviously does imply a certain control over low-level
filesystems, but it really mainly implies a control over the _interfaces_
used to talk the the filesystem, not the filesystem itself.
I personally really wouldn't mind seeing most filesystem patches coming
through Al (and, in fact, in the inode trimming patches that is partly
what as been happening), but I have this nagging suspicion that some
filesystem maintainers would rather eat barbed wire (*).
