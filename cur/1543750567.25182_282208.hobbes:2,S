Some additional info, I've been investigating this for a few hours, and 
it appears that (a) IRQ 18 on my system is shared by ide0 and ide1, and 
that the IRQ storm seems to start the first time I use ide1 (DVD only).
I will be posting a bunch of dmesg results when/if the system reboots, 
but acpi={off,ht} doesn't help, pollirq doesn't help, and system 
shutdown leaves the system unbootable without a full (pull the power 
cord) hardware power cycle.
Questions:
1 - do you have trouble rebooting after a failure?
2 - do you see the IRQ 18 storm start just after the first use of ide1?
3 - and of course if you can get up in console mode, are ide0 and ide1 
shared?
I may rebuild the kernel with IRQ share off just to see if that helps.
