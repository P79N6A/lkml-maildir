I will convert this (usb) code to use the standard completion path,
which you will notice *gained* the ability to properly report both an
error and a partial success as part of this patch.  In fact, fixing
this up was my intention when I wrote this patch, and the later patch
was a compromise intended to get this whole bundle out for review in a
timely manner :)
