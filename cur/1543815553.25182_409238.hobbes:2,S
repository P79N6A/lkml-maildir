Selective unfairness not massive unfairness is what's required.  The 
hard part is automating the selectiveness especially when there are 
three quite different types of task that need special treatment: 1) the 
X server, 2) normal interactive tasks and 3) media streamers; each of 
which has different behavioural characteristics.  A single mechanism 
that classifies all of these as "interactive" will unfortunately catch a 
lot of tasks that don't belong to any one of these types.
