Hi!
With bad behaving apps (like acroread4 which leaks memory like
hell) using all of the available swap space 2.2.17pre19 (and
previous) get into never ending swap-fights which one cannot
interrupt because neither mouse nor keyboard are responding
anymore (well, sysrq-k works but leaves the machine blind).
I suspect acceptable behaviour would be to at least try to
kill some random (ok, not that flamewar again, please...)
process until memory becomes available again (of course killing
acroread in this case would be optimal). But this does not
happen even after half an hour - any clueless user would have
pressed the reset button after this time.
Unfortunately no fix from me, Richard.
