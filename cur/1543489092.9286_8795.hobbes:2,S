totally a function of what you get. a single processor
pentiumII/celeron 450A/etc will have more horsepower
than a dual cpu pentium1/233 -- similar/superior cpu
power and no cpu/bus contention. if you go SMP, look
into dual pentiumII at the very least, dual celeron
if you are on a budget and aren't afraid of
taking a soldering iron to your cpus[1].
[1] I've a dual celeron, instructions for folks
    unafraid of voiding warrantees are @
