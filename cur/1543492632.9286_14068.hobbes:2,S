I need deterministic performance. I can control things on a single processor 
by using SCHED_FIFO, but want to carry this level of control over to SMP.
I'm processing video (bttv - DMA) and 8KHz sound data, so interrupts arn't 
really an issue. But I am doing *heavy* processing, and my application 
requires to be as time sensitive as possible, so I really can't afford to have 
the scheduler 2nd guessing me when I move to SMP.
