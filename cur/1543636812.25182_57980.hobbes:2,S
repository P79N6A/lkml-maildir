From Jargon File (4.3.0, 30 APR 2001) [jargon]:
  Linus /leen'us'/ or /lin'us'/, not /li:'nus/ Linus Torvalds, the author
     of {Linux}. Nobody in the hacker culture has been as readily recognized
     by first name alone since Ken (Thompson).
So I think calling him LT is way, way wrong if you think he's worth the 
comparison to ken.

hung ;-)
