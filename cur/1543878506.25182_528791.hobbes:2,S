As I note it says in a make xconfig help snapshot.  I dutifully copied it 
with a copy/paste.  But since I'm mounting / as an LVM I expect that to 
be a little late although I am building it as a module, but the module is 
being autoloaded by the kernel from the initrd.
I had better double-check that line in grub.conf again.  Thanks for the 
hint.
