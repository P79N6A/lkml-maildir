Hi there.
 > lockd: cannot monitor 192.168.0.5
I've had problems in the past when any of the four sections of the
dotted quad contain a 0 so you might wish to change your subnet and
see if that fixes it.
Curiously enough, I've never had problems with 193.63.255.4 which
contains a 255, the opposite end of the range...
Best wishes from Riley.
