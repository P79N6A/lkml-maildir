Sure but that doesn't bother us :)
The admin in the container has his own /dev directory and can do what he
likes with the devices he's allowed to have.  He just shouldn't have
access to others.  If he wants to rename /dev/sda1 to /dev/sda5 that's
his choice.

No?
What will keep the container admin from doing 'mknod /root/hda1 b 3 1'?
