 # Does anyone have devpts stuff working with glibc2.1? Do you have to link
 # in another library to define openpty()?
I do. I remember hacking the source of ssh (maybe just config.h) to get
devpts stuff to compile, but it did. And I'm using it right now (2.2.0,
ssh 2.0.11, ssh 1.2.26, glibc 2.0.95, egcs 1.0.3a).
I'm sure, though, that it didn't require any additional libraries to be
linked or anything like that. All I remember, honestly, is fixing the
UTMPX stuff.
G'day!
