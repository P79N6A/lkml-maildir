Can we expect shortly a new patch against 2.2.11 ? 
2.2.10.uniform-ide-6.20.genam.patch dosen't apply cleanly. (It's 
natural after applying a big patch like patch-2.2.11). There were
some failures and hunks with fuzz, especially with block/ide.c, so 
I gave up, to be on the safe side (as I can't read the code).
Thanks.
