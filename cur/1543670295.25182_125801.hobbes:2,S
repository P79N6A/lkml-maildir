Dave, since your ISP is blocking my mail, I reply on lkml...
I booted fine the 2.5 kernel by tagging it for netboot and
then placing it on my tftp directory. I never use harddisk
bootloaders, so if you can not make it work with grub,
I would get ahead and make it boot from floppy. Yes, it
takes a minute to load a kernel, but it works and is simple.
I use syslinux for that, it's fairly simple and you can
enter kernel options directly at the boot prompt.
Also, since it's a dos 8.3-formatted floppy, you can upgrade
your kernel by simply replacing the kernel file.
If you need a dos-formatted empty disk, I can post one to my
homepage for you to download.
Greets, Antonio.
ps. I'm having problems with running "make menuconfig" on rh9
    under vanilla 2.5.66, the gnome-terminal hangs easily...
    any ideas? (Yes, I'll try xterm or rxvt just in case).
