ok thanks everyone... i've been educated, and attempted to summarize the 
situation.
if timer_pm is fixed to read the PM timer only once on non-broken systems 
then it is generally the best choice.  it is only at a ~3x disadvantage 
compared to tsc/lapic in that case.
until/unless C3 and deeper resync tsc then it's best not to default to tsc 
even on transmeta.  it would require some co-ordination between timer_tsc 
and ACPI code to know if C3/etc. are enabled, i don't see that 
co-ordination there now.  so it really does seem like adding "clock=tsc" 
to boot is best left to installers/users/not-the-kernel for now.
here's my device summary:
PIT:
- many slow i/o accesses to read
- works everywhere
PM:
- minimum one slow i/o access to read
- measurements on a handful of systems show one PM timer read
  costs ~3x a TSC read.
- kernel presently uses 3 reads as a bug workaround, but can be
  reduced to one read.
- works on ~all hardware less than a few years old
TSC:
- fast read
- on most systems this varies with power mgmt -- and some power mgmt
  occurs "behind-the-scenes" without kernel awareness
- cpufreq is better and better at tracking the changes (but not on SMP?)
- 2.6.10-rc2 disables even more behind-the-scenes power mgmt
- stops counting in C3 (solved? with PIT/PM/RTC read coming out of C3)
- drift possible across nodes in NUMA
local APIC:
- fast read (approx same as TSC)
- enabling lapic causes some dell laptops to crash
- stops counting in C3 (solvable with PIT/PM/RTC read coming out of C3)
- shared with scheduler -- easy to manage today
- can't be shared with scheduler if we add variable scheduler ticks
  (can't read CCR and write ICR atomically -- potential to drift)
- local apic timer ticks are the best choice for scheduling on SMP
  because it allows all the CPU schedulers to be skewed and avoid
  lock conflicts.
- drift possible across nodes in NUMA?
HPET:
- at the moment i know nothing about it (none of my systems have it)
let me know if i've missed anything.
