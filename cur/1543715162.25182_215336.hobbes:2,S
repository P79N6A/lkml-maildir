I think you wanted to put '<< 4' here instead of '<< 2'. Also, could you
put (useless for some) parenthesis to group the left side and the right
side of the bit-wise OR ? I'm always scared that someone changes it to
an addition with good intentions and changes the operators precedence
without noticing.
Cheers,
Willy
