So what we want CPUB do instead is
	spin_lock(lru_lock);
	page = list_entry(lru)
	START ATOMIC 
		page_cache_get(page);
		res = (page_count (page) == 1)
	END ATOMIC
	if (res) {
		atomic_dec (&page->count);
		continue;  /* with next page */
	}
	...
	page_cache_release (page);
I.e. we want to detect _atomically_ that we just raised the page count
from zero to one. My patch actually has a solution that implements the
needed atomic operation above by means of the atomic functions that we
currently have on all archs (it's called get_page_testzero and
should probably called get_page_testone).
The more I think about this the more I think this is the way to go.
