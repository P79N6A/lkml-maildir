We can probably fit this in the existing (variable-sized) header.

Which new field? From /proc/kpagemap + /proc/*/pagemap, you can
basically synthesize any statistic you want, including all the
existing ones. For some data, /proc/pid/smaps (or /proc/meminfo) will
be considerably more efficient.
But in general, most of the statistics in smaps are basically useless
for shared mappings, just like RSS. Problem is, we really don't know
what statistics we want yet, or even if it can be distilled down to
simple numbers anyway.
