are you sure this is needed? The -RT code currently does this:
 static int effective_prio(task_t *p)
 {
         if (rt_task(p))
                 return p->prio;
         return __effective_prio(p);
 }
i.e. if it's an RT task then 'effective priority' is whatever it has
right now. I.e. 'p->prio = effective_prio(p)' will have no effect for RT
tasks. PI would not be working at all if we were overwriting the
inherited priority.
