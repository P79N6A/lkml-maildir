in fact, to get a Patent you are required to explain the invention in sufficant 
detail for somone 'normally skilled' in the field to be able to duplicate it. 
the Patent protection is a reward for _not_ keeping thing secret and publicising 
the details.
at least in that's how it's supposed to work.
