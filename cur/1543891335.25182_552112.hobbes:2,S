4GB of memory is $150 these days and this is a very common board *965 
chipset, the bug occured with any bios > 1666P and 4GB of memory (or) 
version 1612P (and possibly others) with 8GB of memory.
I guess a warning in dmesg or such would be appropriate letting the user 
know of a possible work-around with the mem= option?
