It's a little strange. It is telling you that a 'silly-deleted' file
(one that has been renamed to '.nfsxxxxxx' pending deletion) has a
stale file handle. There's no danger of data corruption, but you
should check (on the server) whether the file is still there: if it
is, then something very strange is going on.
