YES! That should stop andrea complaining :-). [Anyway, problem with
inode quota remains.] Please submit this patch to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu and make sure it gets included. (It
would be nice to document that -T is good idea when removing suid
executables and when working on so hostile remote system that they try
to kill your quota.)
