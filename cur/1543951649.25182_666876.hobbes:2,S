xev has to get events from somewhere.  That somewhere happens to be a buggy
mess right now (X.org evdev device).  Or it is getting it through some other
middleware, like HAL, which can have its own problems.
If you want to test thinkpad-acpi functionality, get HAL and X.org out of
the way.  The easiest way is to do it in single user mode.
