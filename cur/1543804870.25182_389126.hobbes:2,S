I have two of these boards and one of them is constantly hanging, just
simply dead. With 2.6.15 it reports failed I/O (SATA here) and mounts
reiserfs root RO. sky2 works for me, but I had another hang, so sk98lin
might not be the culprit.
The other box (the difference is the SATA drive and the CD) is working OK,
almost 4d uptime now.
Will try to revive the black machine and report more.
(the bad machine is called black and the good is called white :-)
Kalin.
