um, OK, I guess.
Should we use smaller values of 4 if PAGE_SIZE > 4k?  I mean, users of the
page allocator usually request a number of bytes, not a number of pages. 
Order 3 allocations on 64k pagesize will be far less common than on 4k
pagesize, no?
And is there a relationship between this magic 4 and the magic 3 in
__alloc_pages()?  (Which has the same PAGE_SIZE problem, btw)
I must say that this is a pretty grotty-looking patch.

The oft-occurring magic "3" needs a #define.

So we have a nice enumerated value but we only half-use it: sometimes we
implicitly assume that ISOLATE_BOTH has a non-zero value, which rather
takes away from the whole point of creating ISOLATE_BOTH in the first
place.
Cleaner to do:
#define ISOLATE_INACTIVE	0
#define ISOLATE_ACTIVE		1
#define ISOLATE_BOTH		2
	if (!PageLRU(page))
		return;			/* save a tabstop! */
	if (active != ISOLATE_BOTH) {
		if (PageActive(page) && active != ISOLATE_ACTIVE)
			return;
		if (!PageActive(page) && active != ISOLATE_INACTIVE)
			return;
	}
	<isolate the page>
or some such.  At present it is all very confused.
And the comment describing the `active' arg to __isolate_lru_page() needs
to be updated.
And the name `active' is now clearly inappropriate.  It needs to be renamed
`mode' or something.

The phrase "deactivate a page" normally means "move it from the active list
to the inactive list".  But that isn't what this function does.  Something
like clear_active_flags(), maybe?
