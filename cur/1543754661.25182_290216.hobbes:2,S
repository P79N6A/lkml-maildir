Sorry, Andrew, I actually meant to, but forgot to change the CC line. Sorry for
the noise directly to you.

Description: Add a usecs_to_jiffies() function. This will be used in one of my
subsequent patches. With the potential for dynamic HZ values much higher than
1000, we may need to consider times as small as usecs in terms of jiffies.
We have msecs_to_jiffies(), jiffies_to_msecs() and jiffies_to_usecs(), but no
usecs_to_jiffies(). Please check my math.
