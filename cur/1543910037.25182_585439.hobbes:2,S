maxcpus=1 will give you that.
new kernel-parameters.txt in patch should say this
(matching what comment in the code says)

If we cared not for tradition, I'd delete "nosmp",
maxcpus=0 would be a synonym for maxcpus=1
and if you didn't want an IOAPIC, you'd use "noapic"
(heh, don't get me started on the noapic vs. nolapic legacy:-)
The only reason I fixed it instead of changing it per above
is because people may be used to it in non ACPI configurations
and get surprised when it doesn't do exactly the same
thing (or in this case doesn't boot at all) in an ACPI configuration.
Either way is fine with me, but I can't leave it as
"nosmp" and "maxcpus=0" not booting at all on ACPI boxes.
