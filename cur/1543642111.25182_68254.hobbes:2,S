This does not have to be this way.  It is a solvable problem.

Yes, well, this too is solvable.  It, in fact, reminds me that one of the 
things I think needs added to the scsi host settings is a default timeout 
value for typical devices.  Something like adding a default_timeout value 
to each Scsi_Device struct and allowing the scsi driver to modify the 
value during the slave_attach() call.  Then we can put the default timeout 
on non-intelligent controllers to something sane while things like 
MegaRAID controllers can keep their sky high timeout values.

This, too, is solvable.  It just requires that the scsi subsystem start 
paying attention to *how* things fail and making the error handling code 
smart enough to know when to retry things and when to just fail.
