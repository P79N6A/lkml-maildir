There are two reasons Im not putting this in
1. Its a very specialised need. The patch is fine if you need it add it - its
more specialised than other "not needed" patches people keep out of the
main tree. 
2. Its on a common code path. Sum the number of times that path is taken
by the number of users of Linux versus the 3 or 4 who actually need it.
There isnt anything wrong with the patch, its just not relevant to the
userbase as a whole and its on a regularly executed path
