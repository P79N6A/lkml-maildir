Actually there are two issues that are being resolved with this function:
1- BIOS reports incorrect maximum memory read byte count (mmrbc).
This was seen on some older systems > 5 years ago.
2- EEPROM is reporting an incorrect mmrbc.
This function corrects both of these issues, Stephen second suggestion
of moving the BIOS fix to quirks.c is fine with me.  Even with the
code added to quirks.c, we still need this workaround as is to correct
for EEPROM's reporting 4k for a mmrbc.  So I am fine with Stephen's
second suggestion NAK the suggested change to e1000_hw.c
