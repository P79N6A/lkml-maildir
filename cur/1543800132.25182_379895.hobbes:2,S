I think that's too strong. udev setups are fragile and seem 
to be inventented by the devil to make kernel updates hell, but if you
just compile the needed drivers and file systems for root statically 
into the kernel it should work.  For network devices and other
drivers not needed for root you can either load them manually
early in a rc.d file or also compile them in.
Typically when udev goes wrong it just doesn't autoload the modules,
but still processes the events when devices appear.
