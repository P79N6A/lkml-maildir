Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/4/28/61

	Patch rediffed to 2.4.4, otherwise - no changes (2.4.4 has a
fix for ext2 race, but it's unrelated to the thing).
  	Patch is on ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-dir-patch-S4.gz
Please, help with testing.
