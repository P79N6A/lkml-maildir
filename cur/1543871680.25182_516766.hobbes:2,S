Do we? I think just "work" is the way we've been handling them up until
now. Making them suck less for rmap makes them suck more for what they're
good at.

Well you can today remap N pages in a file, arbitrarily for
sizeof(pte_t)*tiny bit for the upper page tables + small constant
for the vma.
At best, you need an extra pointer to pte / vaddr, so you'd basically
double memory overhead.

The thing is, I don't think anybody who uses these things cares
about any of the 'problems' you want to fix, do they? We are
interested in dirty pages only for the correctness issue, rather
than performance. Same as reclaim.
