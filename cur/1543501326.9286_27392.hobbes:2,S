On the subject of Cyrix Pxxx+ CPUs and bugs, I note that there are
twins running around bearing the IBM name rather than Cyrix.
Rumour suggests that these are more reliable that the Cyrix editions.
I find this odd since I believe many Cyrix's were made at IBM plants.
Does anyone else's experience demonstrate this?
