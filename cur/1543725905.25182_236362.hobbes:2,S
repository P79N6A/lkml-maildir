	Lowish memory boxes with plain desktop loads find that the default
of '60' is a terrible one (I'm speaking of 1GHz-ish machines with 256MB
(like mine) or 512MB (like a guy next to me)).  Every person I know who
installs 2.6 complains about how it feels slow and choppy.  I tell them
"The first thing I do after installing 2.6 is set swappiness to '20'."
Sure enough, they set swappiness to 20 and their box starts behaving
like a properly tuned one.
	I don't know what workload the default of '60' is for, but for
the (128MB < x < 1GB) of RAM case, it sucks (and I've seen the same
behavior on a 300MHz 196MB box).
