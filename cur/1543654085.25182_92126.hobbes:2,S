uhmm I have tried to apply it against the 2.4.18-18.7.1xsmp by RH, but of sure 
it gave conflicts... I wan not able to resolve them by hand, in paticular I 
can't find the funcion/macro "processor()"...
Has this patch been applied agaist a more recent kernel yet ?!? 2.4.18 is quit 
out of date, expecially for the APIC-related problems...
My final goal is only to have an IRQ assigne to my custom PCI device by the 
SuperMicro P4DP6 MB (e7500), with HT enabled
tnx in advance
