Doesn't it?  When I upgraded from 2.5.45 to 2.5.48, and installed
module-init-tools-0.7, a whole bunch of modules failed to load
automatically, and I ended up with no pcmcia, no network, no
af_packet, no loopback device...  I had to load them all manually.
Also no USB, hence no USB keyboard and mouse, but I haven't tried
loading those manually.
I thought it was depmod not working, but I must have been wrong.
So what happened - is there a known problem with module auto-loading
at the moment?
cheers,
