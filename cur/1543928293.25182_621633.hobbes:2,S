Is it possible that the hypertansport bus can be in a state where I/O would
work, but not interrupt routing?  I confess my knoweldge of this system bus is
lacking.

But how likely is a kdump kernel to work properly if an errant cpu is running
unhalted while we try to boot?   I understand your point regarding the
significance of the need for reliable IPI's, but in fairness, I think that we
rely on IPI delivery here, weather we want to or not.

I understand your suggestion, but to do that don't we need to do more than just
not move the apic to legacy pic mode?  It was my understanding that the ioapic
delivered timer interrupts to one cpu, who's interrupt handler then distributed
it to the other cpu's via IPI.  That suggests to me that we will need to
re-write the apic config so that the crashing processor is the target of the
ioapic interrupt delivery.
And if this is truly the case, I would really like to furhter understand why
this isn't working on this specific system before I implment anything.  Any
suggestions for how to further root cause this problem?
