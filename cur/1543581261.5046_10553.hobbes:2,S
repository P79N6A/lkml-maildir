Why does this lie gets repeated over and over again? This is as wrong
as the again and again posted "threads is salt" quote of davem.
There are lots of badly set up sendmail sites, just because sendmail
is ubiquitous. Maybe it's because of this.
But a well set up sendmail handles almost any load that you throw at
it. I've set up sites handling an OC-3 load of E-Mail with just a few
boxes fine.
Ok, admittedly not on Linux. If this gets repeated again and again on
LKM, maybe it should read "sendmail on Linux can not handle the load" [1].
>(yeah, I know it's off-topic; but I couldn't resist this one)
Well, at least in this point, you're not enlightened. ;-)
	Regards

[1] And davem maybe meant "Threads on Linux", too. =:-)
