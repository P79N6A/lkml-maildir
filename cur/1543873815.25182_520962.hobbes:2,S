You just need to create an account by clicking the Login button.  It
lets you edit things after that.  But, I'd be happy to put anything in
there you see fit.

To me, it is just because it consumes memory.  Unmapped cache is, of
couse, much more easily reclaimed than mapped files, but it still
fundamentally causes pressure on the VM.  
To me, a process sitting there doing constant reads of 10 pages has the
same overhead to the VM as a process sitting there with a 10 page file
mmaped, and reading that.

I've tried to capture this.  Let me know what else you think it needs.
