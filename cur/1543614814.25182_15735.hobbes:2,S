By default sym-2 use value 3 for the pci_fix_up (cache line size + memory
write and invalidate). The latency timer fix-up has been removed, since it
is rather up to the generic PCI driver to tune latency timers.

Great bug hunting!
It is about certainly not a software bug in the driver. Any latency timer
value should not give any trouble if hardware was flawless. Just the PCI
performances could be affected.
Anyway, value 0 looks way stupid for devices capable of bursting more than
1 data phase, thus the improvement above. :)

Unfortunately, I haven't the errata listing for teh 53c875 rev 4. I have
the DEL for 875 rev. 3 and for 876 rev. 5.
If we assume that rev 4 hasn't more bugs than rev 3, then you may try to
disable MEMORY WRITE and INVALIDATE (and not tell the driver to fix this
up) but allow the driver to fix the bogus zero latency timer. The 875 rev
3 may, under certain conditions, execute unaligned PCI MEMORY WRITE and
INVALIDATE transactions. Note that this may explain data corruptions
occurring for SCSI READ commands not WRITE commands. No other items can
explain, on paper, data corruptions of the form you describe due to 875
chip misbehaviour.
Btw, latency timer zero should not change the likelyhood of this item.
This let me think that the host bridge is likely to be the culprit.
