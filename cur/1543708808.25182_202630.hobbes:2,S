Same box, same problem. (Different kernel, 2.4) Its thermal limiting -
you -really- want cpufreq (or at least acpi) so that linux knows whats
going on.  I've found that running 'i8kfan 2 2' (blast fans), hit fn-z
(tell bios to reset fans) and then setting the fans to 1 1 (medium) will
keep it from happening, much of the time.
Alternately, just fn-z might do it, but it'll kick in again..
(Basically, the cooling on this thing sucks under heavy workloads.)

But performance while running a game, puts the game into slow motion. (Which  is weird because 1.20GHz should be more than enough to run all of the  games I currently have). I have read up on the documentation in /usr/src/linux/Documentation, under the "power" and "cpu-freq" but after disabling ACPI and such, those options do not seem to work anymore.
