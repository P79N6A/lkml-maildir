Interesting.  My imagination when I proposed this
was something based on struct resource that works
like /proc/iomem on x86 but can be meaningfully
be used on systems with where ram lives in a separate
address space from io device memory.

The lack of a type field looses a fair amount of functionality compared
to /proc/iomem.  In particular you can't see where the ACPI data is.
The other direction something like this can go is to dump 
the data structures in linux/mmzone.h

I'm not quite certain what is happening.
I have been playing with kexec user space a little bit and a new 
development release is at:
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/kexec-tools-1.101.tar.gz
I have written a first pass at a user space core dump generator,
using /dev/mem.  /sbin/kexec still needs some work to prepare
the ELF headers before a crash.
