I agree, it had begun to outgrow it's bash roots (e.g. i think it was
the ratio section with variables named a b c d e which drove me nuts
when I couldn't figure out which one was giving me a zero value).

I would disagree.  For example, playing tricks with strings,
pipes/redirects and files in C is a complete pain, compared with
perl/python.  Most of the things I changed with the orignal bash
version were in this subset, and it allowed me to customise it for
what we were doing quickly and easily.
