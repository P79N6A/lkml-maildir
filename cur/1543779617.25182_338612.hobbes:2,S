I'm a Slackware Linux user, and for ages Slackware kernels were build
for i386, releatively recently that was changed to i486 - my point
with this is that while my own custom kernels are slightly faster when
build for my K7, they are not significantly faster than the stock
distro kernels - I mean, I can mesure a difference with benchmarks,
but I don't actually feel/notice the difference.  So, for something
like your project I'd say build the kernel for i386 or i486 and have
it run on as many boxes as possible and don't loose sleep over loosing
performance from that.
