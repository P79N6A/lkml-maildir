I agree that POSIX does not place any requirements on caching, but what
you propose is impossible to implement on NFS: you may be able to get
the atime 'right' (assuming that you are using something like ntp to
ensure that client and server are in sync) but the NFS SETATTR
primitives do not permit you to set the ctime, so that will be set to
the time on the server it processed your SETATTR call (i.e. the close
time). That violates POSIX semantics.
