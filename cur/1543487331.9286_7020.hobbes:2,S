Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it fixes misfeatures. It's more
about optimsations. It basically a result of the RT queue work I did,
which showed that performance is being hampered by cache line
aliasing.
My basic idea is to pack all the per-task information necessary for
the scheduler to walk the run queue (and no more) into a new
structure. Call it struct task_sched. This will be the framework for
the run queue. All the other cruft is left in struct task and a
forwards pointer (and possibly a backwards pointer as well) takes you
from the struct task_sched to the struct task.
