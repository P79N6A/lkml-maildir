	Having no idea of what programs root would execute doesn't mean
you can't reserve sufficient memory for a shell, a ps and a kill.  But if
my machine runs out of processes and I can't log in -- I have little choice
but to hit the RESET button.

	Not all unix systems, however, allow it by default.  Some have 
realized that allocating memory with no "assurance" lowers the overall
integrity/security of the system.  Some require that an administrator 
explicitly allow the unsafe behavior after they have learned about the
implications.
	By allowing 'overcommit', you end up in a situation where now your
90M process touches the last of its memory -- and it isn't there, so....
it SEGFAULT's because the memory mapper can't the address to a physical \
object?
	If you allow overcommit, you can have *either* the SEGFAULT behavior
*or* the no-mem/locked out (process touches everything up front).  If you
disallow overcommit, you reduce the possible behaviors to 1.  The problem is
that suppose the process allocates it's memory -- with the 'overcommit' 
you have a system where it is hard to predict *what* will fail.  Will it be
a system process?  A deamon?  It's a low-integrity system because you can't
figure out the behavior of failure in advance.  
	David's killing demon is fine for a user-space/level solution, but
the kernel should default to the high-integrity option.
	If a distribution vendor wants to ship with 'virtual memory' turned
on, they could have an added entrying in the fstab:
none	vswap	vswap	size=1G		0 0
(default swap-prio for vswap is none -- lower than any other swap space).
	This way you could allow someone to create the same behavior as
now, but by explicit choice by the sysadmin.
