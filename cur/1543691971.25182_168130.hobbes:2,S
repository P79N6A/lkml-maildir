	Umm...  Linus, output truncation is 2.4 problem; any seq_file-based
variant (including one already in 2.6 and being backported to 2.4) solves
that.  The thing being, variant we had in 2.6 was ugly - it had walk through
the tree shoved into ->show() instead of having the iterator do that for
us.  And that's what this patch fixed - it's not that old 2.6 variant would
break, it's that it was done in wrong way.  IOW, changeset comment is
misleading...
