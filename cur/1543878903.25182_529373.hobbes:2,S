This all depends which document and version you review. AIX for example
has or had the same behaviour as Linux which comes from the Large File
Summit and indeed our implementation was carefully tested to pass the
test suite of the time.
SUSv3 seems to subsume the older LFS standards, and has adjusted them
somewhat in the merging so there may well be a good case for normalizing
our behaviour to match SUSv3. Run some tests and send patches.
