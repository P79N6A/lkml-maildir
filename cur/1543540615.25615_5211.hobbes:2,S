did you actually try your own suggestion? Iwas rather puzzled by the fact
that turning on the user limits is obviously not enough. Or at least not
the obvious user limits (RLIMIT_DATA, RLIMIT_STACK, RLIMIT_RSS) but a
rather unobvious one - RLIMIT_AS. This is because malloc(3) uses not just
brk(2) system call (which honours RLIMIT_DATA) but
mmap(MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS) which honours RLIMIT_AS.
