Errr, not quite:

   vBNS+ IPv6 Service Overview
   * Native (not tunneled) IPv6-over-ATM
   backbone since July 1998
   * Dedicated hardware (Cisco 4700s and a
   7507 with OC3/ATM) for IPv6 routing.
   * Full mesh of ATM PVCs among the IPv6
   routers.
   * Backbone provider (pTLA) for the global
   6bone.
There are other backbone ipv6 routers, too, that are non-tunneled.
