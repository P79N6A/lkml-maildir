I don't think so.  Chuck a cheapo card in it, and a monitor and
keyboard, do the install, configure the serial console as per the
howto for it, make sure networking is up so telnet is working,
and then shutdown, rip out the graphics card,monitor,keyboard,
and access the machine over the LAN or via serial console.
In short, you'll be doing what I do.
486-66 firewall, with no hardware other than a modem and NIC in
it.  I access it via telnet/ssh and null modem for when the NIC
is down (backup).
