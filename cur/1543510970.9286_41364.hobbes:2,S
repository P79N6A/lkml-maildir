well, if you read Chuck's suggestion:

(unless i'm grossly misunderstanding Chuck) he is (correctly) suggesting
that the sti-change would make the kernel more debuggable, because 'hard
lockup' spinlock deadlocks would become at least Sysrq-debuggable. [Chuck
please correct me if i'm misinterpreting you]
what i said was that in all these cases the new NMI watchdog already
'debugs' the lockup, so the (quite valid) point is not relevant anymore.
ie.: the sti-change does not make the kernel more debuggable.
