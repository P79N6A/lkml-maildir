Well, some do look okay, but for example this one complicates
freezing... and gains nothing now. It would allow some badly-designed
parts of suspend2 to be merged in future, but I doubt we want them.

No ammount of changes in kernel/power will fix driver problems, that's right.

Well, uswsusp also gained support for compression, splash screen and
RSA-encryption. While S3 support for (kernel) swsusp would be
reasonably easy/non-intrusive, is there a point? I'd really prefer
people wanting to do swsusp+S3 to use uswsusp.
My goal is to keep in-kernel swsusp simple and reliable. fast would be
nice, too. But having all the features is not the goal.
[swsusp+S3 would need some userland support, anyway, because userland
is needed for video card re-initialization. So you'd need utility
similar to s2ram...]
