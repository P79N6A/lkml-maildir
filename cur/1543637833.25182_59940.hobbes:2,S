So we just need to build a directed graph, detect edges without
existing nodes (someone changed the initcall, we depend on) and
cycles (someone messed up the ordering) as errors, sort the
resulting graph toplogically and dump it as a sequence.
This is no rocket science and we have two tools, which does this
all for us (make and tsort, which create a warning for both cases).
The hard part is to CREATE all the dependencies and check and
double check them with the maintainers.
