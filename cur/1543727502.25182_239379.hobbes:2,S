What is normal is that ext3 will perform an *occasional* fsck - by
default, once a month or every thirty-odd mounts - to catch any
corruption that has been missed by the journaling.
Also, the fsck will replay the journal outside the kernel if possible,
so you may have witnessed the journal replay.
This is done because it allows multiple filesystems to replay the
journal in parallel rather than sequentially as doing it in-kernel would
require.
