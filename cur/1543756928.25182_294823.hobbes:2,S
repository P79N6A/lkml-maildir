Hmm, I played about a bit with XFS, but couldn't get my particular
recipe to generate any errors whatsoever (either local or with NFS).
Can you elaborate?  Do you have a simple method which reproduces it?

Neil
PS: I have half an idea that the problem might be to do with the
dcache.  This is probably a wild shot in the dark though as it would be
difficult to find someone who knows less than me about the whole VFS
;-))
PPS: sorry for lack of direct reply - had to manually cut and paste
your message in from an archive, as I forgot to mention in my original
post that I'm off-list at the moment.
