It shouldn't be possible to select mutually exclusive options.
I'm using three .config's:
1. CONFIG_MODULES not set, everything else turned on
2. CONFIG_MODULES and CONFIG_HOTPLUG not set, everything else turned on
3. as much as possible modular
With 2.4.20 there are no compile errors with the first two and only two
errors at "depmod" with the third one (one of these two compile errors
is clearly pathological).
The bigger problem are unusual .config's, e.g. if you turn off common
things like CONFIG_PCI or CONFIG_NET.
Another example is that in 2.4.20 there's a problem with the compilation
of one specific net driver (fixed in 2.4.21-pre) if you select this
specific net driver and not additionally one or more of several other
net drivers.
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a good solution for this problem
that doesn't need O(n^2) .config's for n kernel options.
