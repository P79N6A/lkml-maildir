Btw, this kind of code should be just
	foo = pci_iomap(dev, bar, 0);
because the third argument is _not_ a length, it's a _maximum_ length we 
need to map, with zero meaning "everything" (as does ~0ul, of course, but 
zero is obviously easier).
The only people who want to use non-zero are things like frame-buffers
that might have hundreds of megabytes of memory, but the kernel only needs
to map the actual thing visible on the screen.

Yeah. It shouldn't be a problem on 64-bit architectures, and even on 
32-bit ones the IO-port range really _should_ be fairly small, and a small 
amount of special casing should hopefully fix it.
A lot of architectures end up having to separate PIO and MMIO anyway,
which is - together with hysterical raisins, of course - why the existing
interfaces just assumed that was possible.
