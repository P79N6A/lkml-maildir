	Hello,
	I just wanted to report that we were quite succesfull at using 
kernel 2.2.15pre14 with Andrea elevator-starvation patch. On our server,
it makes an amazing difference. For example with plain 2.2.14, creating a
500Mb Oracle datafile takes 5 mins and completely locks all processes
running (nothing, even the most simple 'ls' can be run during
processing). With the patch, datafile creation is almost transparent,
users won't see any difference ... amazing !
	Thanks a lot for you patch.
