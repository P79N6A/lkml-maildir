Multi-initiator setups are probably the majority in the FC world by now.
But there has been a time around 2000 where various of companies thought
FC is so l33t that they'd put it in as default.  E.g. the early SGI
Origin 3000 used to have FC-attached root disks.  I think Sun has similar
machines.

I don't think a module option is a good idea at this point.  The problem
is you broke some so far perfectly working setups, which is not okay.
The only first step can be printing a really big warning.  After this
has been in for a while (at lest half a year) we can make it a non-default
option or turn if off completely in case the warning never triggered in
practice.
The only resonable thing for 2.6.21 is to put in David's patch, possible
with an even more drastic warning when the rom is invalid and there's
no prom-fallback available.
Note that I expect Sun put in the invalid ROM intentionally, as we have
similar cases with other cards that have totally messed up ROMs in
Sun-branded versions.  Personally I think that's an utterly bad decision
from Sun's side, but we'll have to live with this.
