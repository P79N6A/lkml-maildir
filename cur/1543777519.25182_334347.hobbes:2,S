Thanks.  I think this breaks Cardbus.
The whole point of the way PCI is _presently_ organised is that it allows
busses to be configured and setup _before_ the devices are made available
to drivers.  This breaks that completely:

since we scan the bus, and immediately make all devices available.
This is broken, plain and simple.
