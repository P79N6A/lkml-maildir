just make sure that:
a) you have recompiled the kernel -- distribution-supplied kernels is for
dummies and so using them is silly
b) make sure that neither your newly compiled kernel nor the module are
using modversions. Module versioning is more annoyance-some (heh, a new
English word?) than useful.
