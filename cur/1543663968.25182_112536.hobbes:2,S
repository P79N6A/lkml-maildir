Estimated gurus.
I have updated my PC from 2.2.14 to 2.2.23 -owing to SYN Cookies Problemm-
Since I have updated to 2.2.23, -one month ago-, my PC has reset 4 times,
and there is no error in log files.
This kernel has any problem with memory ??
Is there any patch for this problem ??
Even, in apache files appears "mmap_handler: mmap failed"
Thank you !!!!
