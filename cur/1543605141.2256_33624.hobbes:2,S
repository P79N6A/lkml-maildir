Hi,
Since kernel 2.4.10, I observe a rather poor performance of the good old
floppy drive.  It used to work find in kernel 2.4.9.  Kernel 2.4.10 broke
it, and 2.4.12 did not fix it.  I access my floppy using mtools-3.9.7-4 as
found in RH 7.1.
Not knowing anything about the kernel internals, I would say that the
floppy driver does not do any caching anymore.  With kernel 2.4.9, "mdir"
of a standard 1.44 MB, completely empty floppy disk takes about 1 second
for the first invocation, and next to nothing for the subsequent ones.
>From 2.4.10 on, it takes over 2 seconds every time.  Writing a 30 KB file
with 2.4.9 takes below 3 seconds, with >=2.4.10 it's over 6 seconds.
Maybe I should just keep quiet and be happy that it works at all, after
all floppies are rarely used nowadays, but letting such a performance
degradation go unreported is just beyond me :-).
Regards,
