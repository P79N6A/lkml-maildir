Assuming you are using RedHat or similar, you want to install a kernel-source
RPM not a kernel SRPM.  The kernel SRPM is for rebuilding a packaged kernel
RPM, while if you want to play with the distributions kernel source you want
the kernel-source RPM.
Alternativly, you could download kernel source from kernel.org or a mirror. 
This is different to the kernel that came with your distribution.  The kernels
that come with distributions have been modified with various patches for
feature enhancements and/or bugfixes.
It is the kernels available from kernel.org that are discussed on linux-kernel.
 Distribution kernels should be disscussed on distribution mail-lists.
