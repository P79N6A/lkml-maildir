That doesnt neccessarily make it a derived work. Suppose I publish a
book including a lawyer who says "Your honour I ...". That doesn't make
it a derivative of some previous work I read that used the same phrase.
Equally if I paraphase the entire court scene but use no identical words
it may be a derived work. 
Stop thinking about this as a mathematical question. It isnt about the
union of sets of instructions.
