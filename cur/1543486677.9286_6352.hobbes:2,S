I know. But AFAIK setup was:
hdb - old hda (wd0 ;-) with FreeBSD *only* and BootEasy as loader.
hda - new disk with fresh RH install (LILO as loader with B-E as chained
one). I will look through LILO and B-E source, but IIRC none of them pulls
such tricks.
It *may* be user error (and normally I would assume exactly that), but I
*really* doubt that it was error in use of either LILO or B-E.

	If it touched partition table on *slave* - it's broken. Active or
not, it's on the second disk and there is no reason to do anything with
it - LILO is in full control anyway.
