There's nothing much that the DMA API can do though.  Consider DMA
to a result buffer which is, eg, only 16 bytes in size.  So you get
passed a size of '16' to the DMA API.  What should you do at this
point?  BUG()?
What if you have 64 or 128 byte cache lines?

I agree.
However, I don't think this is an issue for the DMA API to handle; it's
something that driver authors need to be aware of.  If they wish to do
a DMA to a kmalloc'd buffer or even a page, we could require that
offsets and sizes are cache line aligned.
However, remember that turning on slab debugging turns off cache line
alignment, so imposing such a requirement implies that the slab
debugging will break DMA, or driver authors also have to be aware of
that and do their own alignment internally, *or* we provide an allocator
which does unconditionally align.
