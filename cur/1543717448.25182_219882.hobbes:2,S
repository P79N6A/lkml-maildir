The patch hooks into the power subsystem prior to freezing processes and 
after unfreezing processes, so I don't think it's a concern (unless 
something is using the power subsystem rather oddly).  This patch sends 
a single notification of system suspend and a single notification of 
system resume, in case there's any confusion with the individual device 
state change notifiers also recently discussed.  It's been run 
successfully on one ACPI system and one non-ACPI system.

Agreed, with the minor reservations listed in a previous email (suspend 
initiated by drivers must coordinate ad-hoc with userspace, etc.).
I'll let anybody who cares more deeply about this speak up now, 
otherwise this isn't a battle I'll be fighting on behalf of others any 
more.  Thanks -- Todd
