	Aside of getting more of house-keeping data processing,
	and memory storage capacity ?  (Than with the original
	16 bit 1172A processor.)

	The case with HUBBLE is *very* special, even though it is
	(sort of) embedded system.   NASA is flying Linux on space-
	missions where it 1) isn't life critical system 2) where the
	computing hardware is in human rated environment.
	(Note: I didn't say *mission critical* -- mission (science)
	 goals may well depend on functionality of the Linux based
	 laptop, but that is "just" a big embarrasment, not dead
	 astronauts.)
	The HUBBLE is *not* Human rated.  In fact it flies thru so
	called South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly at every orbit -- every
	about 1.5 hours.  (Well, not *every* orbit, only every 3rd-4th,
	or so..)  That area in near-earth space happens to be low-lying
	extension of Van Allen radiation belts around our planet.
	(The service missions don't have the astronauts doing EVA while
	 the flightpath enters that area of space.)
	So why 486-50 ?  It is available in radiation hardened model.
	(I didn't know that - but its been a few years since I checked
	 what is available in that esoteric hardware field.)
	A friend of mine used to be writing software for embedded systems.
	He said roughly:  Embedded software is where PROM change needs
	digger crew to get to to box buried under a busy street.  (If not
	a cable-ship to drag it out from the bottom of an ocean ... or
	need a shuttle mission worth around USD 1 billion..)
	Those cadgets below the streets and in the ocean do tend stay in
	service for *long* times.  Tens of years, very least.  Mainly
	because the installation costs are so high...  (The cadget costs
	next to nothing compared to the work.)
