It's possible that e2fsck corrupted the files, but they also could
have been corrupted earlier by the earlier I/O errors.  There are some
relatively rare filesystem corruptions which e2fsck doesn't handle as
gracefully as it should, though, I will admit.  I would need to see
the e2fsck transcript to be sure. 
Were there any messages about needing to relocate inode tables by any
chance?
