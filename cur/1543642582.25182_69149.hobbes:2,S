It's OK. The calculations are duplicated and the FS's are too. The
calculation is highly parallel.

Yes we do. Its place in the topology of the network dictates what it was
working on, and anyway that's just a standard parallelism "barrier"
problem.

There is no risk, because, as you say, we can always use nfs or another
off the shelf solution. But 10% better is 10% more experiment for
each timeslot for each group of investigators.

Ask the people ho might scream for 10% more experiment in their 2
weeks.

Any X that is not a standard FS. Yes, I agree, not exact.

I have to catch a plane ..
