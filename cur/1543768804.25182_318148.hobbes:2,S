I think it would be a fair bit of work to guarantee this, unless you add 
enough capacitive energy storage or something onboard to ensure that the 
write can complete even if power is lost. Some hard drives have the same 
problem, actually, where a bad sector can be produced if it was being 
written at the time power was lost.
