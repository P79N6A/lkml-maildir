Then manifestly it is installed incorrectly, as "info crypt" (in my
near-virgin RH 6.0 system) just shows the (incorrect) man page.  The
only way to the "real" info version of crypt that I've found is down
through links within "info libc", where crypt appears as a node.  It
isn't installed as a man page, and "info crypt" finds the obsolete man
page instead of the libc node.
