No.  Linux also runs on Alpha 21064, 21164; Sparc, UltraSparc; PowerPC;
MIPS; StrongARM; and more.
I know you mention that it's available below, but this causes confusion. 
Why not say that it requires a "supported processor" and that supported
processors are 386 or above & compatibles, Alpha, m68k, Sparc, UltraSparc,
and PowerPC.  (Note the capitolization there!)

This is not new in 2.2.

You ought to start all of these sentences with caps, and leave space on the

PCMCIA support is not new in 2.2.x.
