Ah. I realy hoped that cap_task_kill() was already killed. And I googled
this patch: 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120422062515386
But I checked 2.6.25-rc5-mm1.bz2, it is still here. And I didn't find
anything related in 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/.
 I even checked
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=history;f=security/commoncap.c
So, is it still here or killed? If it is dead - great ;)
Oleg.
