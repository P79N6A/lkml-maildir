   I have no idea how acpid/cardmgr bloated.
   So will go abstract.
   But this is common observation: event managers tend to be bloated.
   Rationale: "Let's work around this bug here". Very common.
   I'm implementing couple of event daemons right now - I have had hard 
time to protect them and force bugs being fixed in right place (test 
department screams, driver developers are saying this is "just couple 
lines of codes in daemon and tens in driver" - hopefully I do have good 
management, so B.S. aka bullshit is no go here. I'm really lucky).
   So to not to have hard time doing simple things - hotplug just does 
prohibit complicated/stateful processing implicitely.
   But, yeah, sure, any one can work around it - just make event handler 
a simple redirector to event handling daemon ;-)))
   my 0.02 euros.
P.S. take a look at mount... nfs hooks, smbfs hooks... -o handling is 
just mess. All this mess for you can simply say "mount this there".
Nice ;)

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
