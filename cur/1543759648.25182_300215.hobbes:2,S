Roland, the sigstep.exp test in the GDB testsuite will show this
problem; if your patch monotonically improves GDB HEAD testsuite
results and removes all the FAILs for sigstep.exp, then it's probably
equivalent to the one I just posted for this testcase.
I think mine is more correct; the problem doesn't occur because the
debugger cancelled a signal, it occurs because a bogus TF bit was saved
to the signal context.  I like keeping solutions close to their
problems.  But that's just aesthetic.
