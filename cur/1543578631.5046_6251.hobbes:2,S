The only thing that I didn't have before (2.2.17) in my syslog and that I 
seen in this /var/log/messages is that IRQ 9 is shared by eth realtek 
controller and the USB uhci one, but I don't know if that could be related
to lock. 
Another thing (related, unrelated?) is that sometimes since the install of 
the new kernel, after leaving the PC in stand by for some hours, when it 
unsuspends I have some pixels rows at the top of the screen green.
Boh?
