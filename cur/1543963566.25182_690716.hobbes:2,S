Hi all,
Here's a series to rationalize the use of PTE_MASK and remove some
amount of ad-hocery.
This gist of the series is:
 1. Fix the definition of PTE_MASK so that its equally applicable in
    all pagetable modes
 2. Use it consistently
I haven't tried to address the *_bad() stuff, other than to convert
pmd_bad_* to use PTE_MASK.
I've compile tested it a bit and run it on 32-bit PAE (native and
Xen), but I haven't tested it with >4G memory, non-PAE or 64-bit.  In
other words, it needs some time in Ingo's torture machine.
