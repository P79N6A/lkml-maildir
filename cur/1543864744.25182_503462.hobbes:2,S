I've actually sent Andrew a patch that does that and the same thing to
the counter in iunique as well. It's in -mm now, but I think it's pretty
safe and can probably go into your tree any time you're ready for it.
It's been quite a while since I looked at the original problem, but I
believe glibc actually uses stat64 to make the call, so it doesn't
throw the warning. The EOVERFLOW comes from glibc when it gets back an
st_ino value that won't fit in the 32 bit buffer provided by the program.
Obviously, we can't do anything for filesystems with permanent inodes larger
than 32 bits, but when generating them on the fly via new_inode or iunique,
we ought to try and have them fit in 32 bits if possible (at least as long
as we can).
