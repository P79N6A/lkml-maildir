Given that it should shut down after a job completes and I work 130+ miles
away, that's not optimal. I'd rather not use the system to heat air that
the a/c needs to cool so I can run the idle loop. Currently I just run a
script to use "lilo -R" to boot to an OS which is smart enough to do the
job. Actually old kernels did the job until the APC was enhanced. More QA
buy the "it doesn't break MY system" method of testing...
At some point I'll convert to ext3, and shutdown with sync() and have the
X10 module cut power, or use "find why this kernel shuts it down and that
one doesn't" as an employment test when some kid applies for a kernel
hacker job ;-)
