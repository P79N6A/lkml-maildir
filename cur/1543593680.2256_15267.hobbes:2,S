It might not change much, but it can from time to time. The meaning of
a particular option can evolve over time. I wouldn't want to see
options have sections like "for kernel x.y.z the behaviour is this,
but for kernel a.b.c the behaviour is thus". It's just clutter.
Another issue is ease of use. I just want to be able to download a
single tarball, and then be able to go offline and configure, compile,
read docs and so on. One example of this is when setting up a new
box. Another is when I'm on the road, dial in and download a new patch
and then hop on a plane and start playing with it.
