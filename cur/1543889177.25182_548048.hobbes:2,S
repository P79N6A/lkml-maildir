It's an useful patch for me. Without it, my sony vaio pcg-fx701 was very
erratic in resume (kernel 2.6.21.1; it works well with the .17 ubuntu
kernel). With this patch, I have done 7 cycles flawlessly. Even the
out-of-tree rtl8180 wireless driver [1] works ok across resumes. 
The only problem is that there is an gaping delay of 60 seconds (more or
less) on resume. I have the syslog trace copied below; could be a timer
problem? Is it known? (It is scaring because the laptop seems dead
during this time. I'm not and expert, but it seems here:
