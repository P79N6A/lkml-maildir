glibc works around this bug by hardcoding "int 0x80" at
glibc-2.3.5/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/clone.S line 99.

It's SYSENTER_RETURN.

Your patch almost works but it copies the stack into the parent's address space.
Using access_process_vm() fixes it.  However, that still leaves unfixed the case
where vsyscall-int80 is used.
[patch] i386: fix sys_clone when using vsyscall-sysenter
Fix a problem when sys_clone is called from sysenter vsyscall and a new stack
for the child is specified.  Some data needs to be copied from the parent
to the child stack or the child will segfault.
