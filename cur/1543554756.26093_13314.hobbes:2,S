It comes entirely down to one thing. The termination function of the thread
has to be code in the kernel code not a module. Thats it, nothing else. So
you just need some kind of sleep/wakeup proceedure for it.
As far as I can see all you need is
wait_and_die(sem)
{
	up(&sem);	/* In the kernel so can unload */
	sys_exit(0);	/* Never return to the unloaded module code */
}
in the main kernel. In fact if you were bored you could build this on the kernel
stack ;)
