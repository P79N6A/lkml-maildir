OK, I'm looking for any help I can get with this problem.  I have an old IBM 
PS/2 Model P70 (the portable version of the Model 70 Microchannel system) that I
use at home for a dial-on-demand proxy.  It's been used for this role for about 
two years and has run Linux kernel from as early as 1.1.59.
I have been running a patched up version of 2.0.36 with portfw and ipchains and 
of course the MCA (Microchannel) patches and PPP-2.3.5 ppp compiled in.  
Using this setup with my USR 56K modem I consistently get transfers of 
compressed file of 4.9-5.2Kps, however, when running kernel 2.2.1 my speeds are 
lowered by about 40% (3.5Kps typical).
While I don't really have any true pressing need to upgrade this machine to 2.2,
I thought it would be nice to run the first stable kernel with built-in support 
for microchannel, instead of the patched up 2.0 stuff.  Now I'm doing everything
I can think of to figure out why the PPP is so slow, and I'm looking for 
guidance. Here the lowdown so far:
The P70 was originally a 386/20Mhz machine.  This one has been upgraded with a 
Cyrix Cx486DRx2/40Mhz and runs about like a 486/33 (Bogomips 15.7).  I'm using 
the built in serial port which is a 16550A.
The symptom is slow PPP with quite a few FRAME errors reported on the ppp0 
interface.  Under 2.0.36 performance was always great and never reported any 
errors.
My first testing basically involved compiling a very stripped down kernel with 
no firewalling, etc to add overhead to the tcp/ppp communications chain, 
tweaking all the PPPD settings, disabling all compressing on the link, using 
irqtune, killing all backgroud proccesses, etc.  I could improve things 
slightly, but nothing major.
I then patched in the ppp.c from the PPP-2.3.5 package into the 2.2.1 kernel so 
that I would be running the same ppp version on 2.0.36 as on 2.2.1.  The problem
remained.
Since I was now running the same ppp code on both kernel and the problem 
remained the same I began to suspect the serial routines were running slower in 
the new kernel
I then began to play with the 16550 receive fifo FCR_TRIGGER value in serial.c. 
 I changed this from the default of 8, to the other options of 1,4, and 14.  
could notice no difference with 4 or 14, and with 1 my frame errors went up 
significantly (as expected).
I then decided to begin to go back through the 2.1.x kernels and see if I could 
pinpoint when the problem was introduced. I think (although I'm still testing) 
that the problem was introduced between 2.1.100 and 2.1.102.  Kernel 2.1.100 
seems to work correctly, 2.1.101 doesn't seem quite right (I'm going to compile 
another one clean just to make sure), and the in 2.1.102 things go bad.
Interestly 2.1.102 is when IPCHAINS replaced the old ipfwadm.  Now this 
shouldn't affect much here because I'm compiling without firewalling options 
enabled for this testing, and even if I did enable chains, I'm using the 
IPCHAINS patch on my 2.0.36 kernel.  The other things that were changed seemed 
to involve IRQ handling.  Some seemed to be related to edge and level triggered 
interrupts proccessing.
I found this suspect since the microchannel machines use level triggered 
interrupts instead of the more common edge triggered stuff in the ISA world, 
unfortunately I'm understand lille about the linux irq stuff and I'm learning 
it from scratch.  Does anyone out there who is more familiar with the linux irq 
handling think that this could be related to the problem?
I'm also looking for any other sugestions as to what could be causing this 
problem (in case I'm really off base now).  Any help or guidance of ways to 
troubleshoot this would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Tom Sightler
