Hi.
Sorry for coming late to the party. I received a request to provide a Suspend2 
patch for current -mm this morning, so I've only just had impetus to look at 
the impact of klibc.

This patch doesn't look right to me. After it is applied, the user will have 
no way of saying that they don't want to resume (noresume). I assume the 
removal of resume= isn't a problem because you're expecting them to use that 
other undocumented way of setting resume= that Pavel mentioned a while ago?
Regards,
Nigel
