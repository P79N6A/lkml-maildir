This is probably the only feasible method of getting general access to
hardware of that kind.

This is a novel use for it that may require an extension to support.
It's worthwhile but I'm terrified enough of the invariants broken by
the code as it stands, even disregarding further extension.

The 64GB simulation on 64-bit sort of is, but isn't really since the
additional minor faults would be taken with the ordinary mmap()
approach, incurring one or two additional round trips through the
kernel and actually blocking at the time of access instead of pre-
populated (prefaulted). The access is also likely to be sparse which
raises the spectre of pagetable fragmentation yet again...
Thanks for the good insights.
