post-install bttv modprobe -k tuner

A driver can allways check the bus id.

You can have modules which are independent from the device which is the
i2c bus master.  For example video text chips, a character device for i2c
access, ...)

It has one major design flaw:  It can handle only simple bit-controllers.
More clever i2c controllers (which can do complete bus-cycles in hardware 
for example) can't be handled.
