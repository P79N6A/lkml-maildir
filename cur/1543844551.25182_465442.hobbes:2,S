Hello Andrew,
This version is basically unchanged except for rediff
against 2.6.18. I was running previous version for
several weeks on 2.6.17.x kernels.
Russell King was giving me some feedback. I think that
my reply satisfied him - I got no further comments:

On with patch explanation:
Currently, magic in include/linux/delay.h
inlines mdelay and ssleep, and various arches
do the same to udelay.
This is pointless. We are going to perform a delay of 1000+
CPU cycles anyway, no need to optimize away a few cycles.
This patchset converts magic calls to these inlines/macros
into pure and simple function calls, with no additional
math done or hidden arguments pushed to stack
at the callsite.
Reduces allyesconfig kernel by about 7 kb.
