Subject: [PATCH] Disable INTx when enabling MSI in forcedeth
At least some nforce cards continue to send legacy interrupts when MSI
is enabled, and these interrupts are treated as unhandled by the
kernel. This patch disables legacy interrupts explicitly when enabling
MSI mode.
The correct fix is to change the MSI infrastructure to disable legacy
interrupts when enabling MSI, but this is potentially risky if the
device isn't PCI-2.3 or is quirky, so the correct fix is going into
mainline, while patches like this one go into -stable.
Legend has it that it is most correct to disable legacy interrupts
before enabling MSI, but the mainline patch does it in the other
order, and this patch is "obviously" the same as mainline.

Is there anyone else who should review this early? It should probably 
still wait on the patch from 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/21/332
 actually 
getting into the mainline, and I don't know the status on that.
