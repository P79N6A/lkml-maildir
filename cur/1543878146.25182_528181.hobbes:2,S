We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.20.6 kernel.
This has 2 important fixes that should have been in 2.6.20.5.  They are
issues that were pointed with 2.6.20.5 patches during its review cycle,
but the patch updates were mistakenly dropped.  Please accept our
apologies for the mistake.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.20.5 and 2.6.20.6.
The updated 2.6.20.y git tree can be found at:
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.20.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
        www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
-chris
