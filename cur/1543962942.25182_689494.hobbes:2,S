> This patch introduces support for the SOCK_NONBLOCK flag in socket,
> socketpair, and  paccept.  To do this the internal function sock_attach_fd
> gets an additional parameter which it uses to set the appropriate flag for
> the file descriptor.
> 
> Given that in modern, scalable programs almost all socket connections are
> non-blocking and the minimal additional cost for the new functionality
> I see no reason not to add this code.
