Hi Pavel,
Thanks. I tested all the S3 related changes during my last posting. That
time I had access to an x86_64 box which supported ACPI state S3. Since then
this code has not changed and it has been running successfully in RHEL5 
kernels. Now I don't have access to an x86_64 machine which supports S3
so I can't test suspend to RAM. But I am sure that these patches are working
as nothing has changed since last posting.
Just now Nigel reported successful suspend to RAM results for 2.6.20. I
have requested him to test it for 2.6.21-rc2 also, if possible.
I have throughly tested suspend to disk (S4) and it works fine.
Thanks
Vivek
