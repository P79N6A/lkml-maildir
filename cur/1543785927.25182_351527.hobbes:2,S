It is indeed wrong outside timer.{h,c}, but setup_timer() is a
part of timers subsystem, so I hope it's ok.

Yes, in that case we will have to change setup_timer(). But I
doubt this will happen. init_timer() only needs to set timer's
->base, and to ensure the timer is not pending.

I think this can save a couple of cpu cycles. The init_timer()
is not inline, gcc can't reorder exprx() and init_timer() calls.
Ok, I do not want to persist very much, I can resend this patch.
Andrew, should I?
