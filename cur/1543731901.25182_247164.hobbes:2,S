Hello,
Compiling the 2.6.8.1 kernel, I found three interesting places (looking very 
quickly, perhaps would find more) when the kernel was compiled with unused 
parts:
1. it compiles everything inside /arch/i386/kernel/cpu/ . From my point of 
view, that is incorrect, especially when choosing processor like Cyrix/VIA C3 
(which is a cyrix, not a transmeta, nexgen or something else) and explicitly 
specifying not to make generic x86 code. Perhaps, choice should be given. 
About 15KB of memory wasted on this...
2. then I found it to compile a synaptics touchpad support - also must be 
optional. Another something like 8KB
3. and the third thing I found is that scsi_ioctl is compiled even if SCSI 
support is taken out... very interesting behaviour... another like 8KB 
wasted... I have no SCSI, no USB MassStorage, no CD-RW, no nothing could 
possibly use SCSI...
Many things could be put on about 100-200KB spared if not migrating to 2.6... 
Perhaps, more controls should be available to configure - new kernels should 
be smaller and faster, not larger, shouldn't they?
Thanks,
Dmitry
