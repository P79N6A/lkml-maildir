I suppose we could... Is the procedure that nfs_lookup() should first
rehash the dropped dentry, then return it instead of NULL?

->dir is the important one here, as it provides the filehandle. We
only use ->dentry in order to give us a name/string for the
NFSPROC_REMOVE call.

But that's the best we can do in any scenario. NFS does not ever give
you a guarantee that someone won't screw things up on the server, nor
does it give you any failsafe mechanism for detecting it.
That's why operation atomicity is such an issue with the current
kernel, and is why I'm so eager to push the intent patches into 2.6.
Sure sillyrename fails miserably in the atomicity department. There's
bugger all we can do about that: if you are suggesting we should rely
on some sort of revalidation before we unlink, then that's just as
race prone as what we have now.
Cheers,
