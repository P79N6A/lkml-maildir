It seems that the noexec in fstab no longer works. Is this
intentional?
In fstab I have the following line:
/dev/hda1       /dosc   vfat    codepage=850,umask=000,noexec 0 0
A ls -l in /dosc shows:
-rwxrwxrwx    1 root     root     267657216 Jun 28 22:34 win386.swp
The same case with iso9660:
-r-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            0 Jan 24  2000 s3cd1.dat
However umask=111 is still working. I don't know exactly when this
happened, but it was hot there in earlier 2.4 kernels.
