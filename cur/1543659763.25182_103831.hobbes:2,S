You mean read_lock(&files->file_lock); :)
Dave, does your webserver benchmark clone() tasks with CLONE_FILES ? Unless
the fd table is shared, can't see why there would be contention on this.
If it is indeed necessary to share fd table, then there is a somewhat
unmaintained lockfree fget() patch (files_struct_rcu) that you might want
to try.

ISTR a patch from Stephen Hemminger at OSDL that used Andrea's
sequence number trick based rwlock (frlock) to implement do_gettimeofday.
It might be relevant here.
Thanks
