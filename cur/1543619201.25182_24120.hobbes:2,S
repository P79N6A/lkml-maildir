Whew...
Thanks to a tip from Leonard Zubkoff I've successfully reconstructed the 
data on master.kernel.org.  However, before putting the system back 
online or even mounting anything readwrite, I'm doing a full backup of 
the contents.  I'm going to let the backup run overnight, as I'm about 
to head home to sleep.
Clearly, expanding capacity on this system is no longer being 
considered; we need to replace the server.
