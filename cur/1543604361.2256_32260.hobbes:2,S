The problem is that the disk subsystem doesn't take into account the
priority of the process initiating the heavy (or any for that matter) IO.
AFAICT, the only way to get fair disk access is to modify (shorten) the
elevator queue lengths (which IMHO are much too long).  Check out elvtune
(I'm testing "-r 500 -w 750" right now) in the util-linux package.
