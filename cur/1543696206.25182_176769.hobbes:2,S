This is the way it is susposed to work, but I am working on a problem
where this does not seem to be happening.  We have a machine with 6G
of ram.  It reads some huge files (~5G) and cache fills up.  Then
it starts to process the data and goes into a swap storm because it
can not get any memory for the process because it all is in the cache.
If you run top, you see kswapd stuck at the top.
If anyone has any ideas about this, I would love to hear them.
Thanks,
Jim
