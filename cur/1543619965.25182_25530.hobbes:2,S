Subject: [PATCH] Specialix RIO Oops fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/2/4/77

The patch below fixes an Oops in the Specialix RIO driver.  I sent
this to the maintainer a couple of months ago and never got a
response.
Note that this patch doesn't actually make the driver *work* for my
client...  It still causes a hard lockup that I was unable to debug in
the short time I had to work on it.  Specialix apparently told my
client that they would have to switch to the original Red Hat 7.1
kernel (2.4.2-something) if they wanted it to actually work.
In any case, this patch seems to be a no-brainer.  It merely adds a
check that I see in every other serial driver's set_real_termios()
function.
