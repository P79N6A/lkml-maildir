Thanks!

I'm sorry you feel that way, Joe.  I had no intention of "diluting" your 
code, and I certainly don't want you to remove your name from good code 
you spent significant time & effort on.  I'm just about to go to sleep, 
so I made this patch pretty quickly.  I think the 4 comments I kept are 
the most useful and non-obvious.  Let me know if this looks acceptable 
to you.  As I said, I have no desire to have you pull your name from the 
code, especially since I feel it is good code!
Andrew, once Joe and I work out an acceptable patch, we'll make sure you 
get a copy.
Cheers!
