Thanks, I didn't knew that.
Anyway, could the new PCI layer increase IDE-DMA stability on systems other 
than i845?
BTW: I forgot to mention that I have an PIIX3 board with K5PR166 .
PIIX3 has been somewhat shaky through the whole 2.4 kernel series, but the DMA 
timeouts I get on my machine with 2.4.19 are significantly less than with 
2.4.17 (only one every few days). The non-DMA transferrate has also increased 
to normal levels.

I have again taken a look at the changelog for 2.4.20-pre8-ac1. It has some 
entries related to IDE. Some are cleanups, some are DMA related.
So how are the chances that things get better or worse, when switching to 
2.4.20?
Is there anything I can do to help tracking this error down, without diving 
too deep into the kernel sources?
One crash every month is acceptable for me (much better than any M$-experience 
I ever had), but somehow it is not satisfying ;-(
