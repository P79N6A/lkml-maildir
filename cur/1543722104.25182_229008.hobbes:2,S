Subject: PATCH: Dell laptop lockup fix for ALSA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

OSS avoids the Dell lockup by not hitting the problem register (which 
apparently breaks resume on a Sony laptop). ALSA keeps a flag and uses
pci subvendor info to clear it for problem Dell laptops. Unfortunately
there is at least one other Dell laptop which is affected. This adds
its sub id's
[Patch from Dan Williams @ Red Hat slightly reformatted by me]
