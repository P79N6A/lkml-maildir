<snip long story>
If I didn't misread your story, the other common issue is Red Hat's 
kernel, wich is heavily patched with several good (and not so good) 
patches. You may have better luck with mainline 2.4.22 (kernel.org).
In any case Red Hat kernel problems should probably be reported to Red 
Hat, their bugzilla comes to mind.
