I have been working on adding idle notifier for i386.
I am wondering about this code:
/* Called from interrupts to signify idle end */
void exit_idle(void)
{
        if (current->pid | read_pda(irqcount))
                return;
        __exit_idle();
}
And in particular the irqcount. I am guessing you are trying
to protect against nested interrupts. In fact, I think we only
want to get notified once the interrupt stack is fully unwound.
because we get way more exit_idle() than enter_idle().
Is there an irqcount mechanism on i386?
Thanks
