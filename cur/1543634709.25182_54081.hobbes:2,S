BTW, Kai, a bug was added when you changed the path of the
'host-progs' value in drivers/video/Makefile, the build looks
for a dependency file that isn't there.
Amusingly, eliminating the host-progs line in this Makefile results in
a successful build.
This is an area that needs dealing with, a host build program that is
used by multiple directories.  I think conmakehash, this particular
case, belongs in scripts/.  That might be the generic solution to
build tools used by multiple places of the tree.
