Sure, by "established" I merely meant "established for and by usage
in Linux kernel sources", nothing more. Also, High Performance Serial
Bus is not the only generic sounding name of a bus or architecture.
How about Small Computer System Interface for example? Universal Serial
Bus and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment aren't much more colorful
either. Granted, their acronyms are prettier than HPSB, but not as
elitist. ;-)
