But this one simply will not get applied, for all the reasons already
outlined. It _will_ cause the same problems that it tries to fix, just at
some later time.
Besides, I seriously doubt it is any faster than what is there already.
Time it, and notice how:
 - fninit takes about 200 cycles
 - fxrstor takes about 215 cycles
and your added 16*(pxor/xorps) likely takes at least 8 cycles.
In short, your "fast" code isn't actually any faster than doing it right.
