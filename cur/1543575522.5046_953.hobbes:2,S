Err.. Did you see the comment about shared memory info being permanently
removed because (something about too CPU intensive to justify...)?
It looks like we need to find another way to get kernel info rather
than from /proc. We need to calculate stuff only when it's needed.
Calculating stuff all the time, to make it available should somebody
care to read it in the /proc file-system is wasteful.
Maybe we need to have some kind of 'kernel ioctl' where a user-mode caller
'pays' for the CPU cycles necessary to obtain the info that the caller
requests. A better idea might be to have the 'read' of a particular
/proc file-system item, result in the calculation of the new values.
That way, the read and calculation of new values gets charged to
the reader.
In any event, the continuous calculation of 'kernel stuff' that may
be read once a week at most, is definitely a waste of CPU cycles.
Cheers,
