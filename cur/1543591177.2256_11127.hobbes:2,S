The same situation appears when using bonding.o. For several years,
Don Becker's (and derived) network drivers support changing MAC address
when the interface is down. So Al's /dev/eth/<n>/MAC has different values
depending on whether bonding is active or not. Should /dev/eth/<n>/MAC
always have the original value (to be able to uniquely identify this card)
or the in-use value (used by ARP, I believe) ? Or maybe have a
/dev/eth/<n>/MAC_in_use ?
