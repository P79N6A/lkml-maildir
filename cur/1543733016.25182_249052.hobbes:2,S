Please don't think that I'm talking for Tungsten at this or any other time on 
the DRI list.  I'm talking for myself and have never attempted to convey here 
or elsewhere a "company" view without explictly flagging it up as such. 
Apologies if the use of a TG mailing address is confusing, but I will have to 
continue using it for the meantime as it is the one subscribed to this list.
Likewise, are you making a RedHat statement that you believe that your 
endusers need to be able to compile a kernel to use your products, or is that 
a statement of a regular LK developer?  I'm sure you appreciate the parallel.
But in general, yes, I'd like to think that you don't have to have even heard 
of a compiler in order to be able to install a video driver...
I don't see why installing a DRI driver should be more difficult than 
installing an NV, ATI or even a windows driver...
I don't see why it should be necessary to reboot a machine just to update it's 
video driver...
