It would be interesting if you could send out what you have.
It would also be interesting to know if we really care?  The
machine is already running 10x slower than it would be if it
had enough memory; perhaps it is just not a region of operation
for which we're interested in optimising.  (Just being argumentitive
here ;))

mm.  Tricky.  This is interesting:
