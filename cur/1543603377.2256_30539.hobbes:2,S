ext3 with ordered data writes has performance nearly up to the level
of the fast-and-loose writeback mode for most workloads, and still
avoids ever exposing stale disk blocks after a crash.
Sure, it's a tradeoff, but there are positions between the two
extremes (totally unordered data writes, and totally journaled data
writes) which offer a good compromise here.
Cheers,
 Stephen
