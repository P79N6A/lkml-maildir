No, let's kill this thing altogether.  The only driver in the world
using the CSCONFIG_* defines in there is the sunhme driver and it
defines it's own macros in drivers/net/sunhme.h  This header is more
than useless these days.
The header still exists in older trees and the revision history.
So people can still get to it there.
