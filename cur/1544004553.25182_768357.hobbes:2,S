Hmm... The whole thing is splitted in two levels: the infrastructure
to trace on call and return (and call
a return handler) and the higher level tracer.
The first could be called ftrace_exit because it is waht it does.
And the second is much more about cost evaluation of functions and so
could be named function_cost. Its
functions and structures could have this in their name whereas the low
level things could have ftrace_exit in
their name.
What do you think?
