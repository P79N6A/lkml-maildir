I don't have the image. It's booted from a floppy (or by nfs, thanks to their
triple secure fallback). I gave it to them. They put it on a floppy. I don't
have the floppy. They don't know which floppy it is (the servers been up for a
while).  The floppy's not in the drive.  I may not be in the same
country.  It may be midnight there.  Next?  Here's something for you to
look at.
