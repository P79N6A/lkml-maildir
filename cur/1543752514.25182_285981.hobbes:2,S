This is too broad and sweeping of a statement, and can be used to
excuse almost any bug triggerable only by local execution.
Most of the local DoS's I'm aware of are memory management -related,
i.e. user- triggerable proliferation of pinned kernel data structures.
Beancounter patches were meant to address at least part of that. Paging
the larger kernel data structures users can trigger proliferation of
would also be a large help.

I agree on the latter count. On the first, I have to dissent with the
assessment of local DoS's as "unimportant".
