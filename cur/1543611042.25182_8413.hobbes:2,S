I have a host which has canonical address foo, which also happens to be a
gateway. Foo happens to be on the local side of the gateway, so when
initiating connections, they appear to be from the gateway interface
address, bar. This is inconvenient because bar is an address on a network
I don't have DNS authority over, etc., so it'd be nice if outgoing
connections by default would appear to come from foo.
I'll take a look at iproute.
