Hi Manuel, 
I was checking my kernel configuration, and some doubts arised in my mind. 
Would you please check if my parameters are the same as yours? 
set:
CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
CONFIG_SCSI
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL 
unset:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_GENERIC
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIIMAGE (I'm unsure on this) 
Is that right? 
Thank you.
Bye,
Guido
