(didn't see this until now, axboe@suse.de doesn't work anymore)
I'm assuming that you mean you vmsplice with SPLICE_F_GIFT, to hand
ownership of the pages to the kernel (in which case SPLICE_F_MOVE will
work, otherwise you get a copy)? If not, that'll surely cost you a data
copy.
This sounds remarkably like a recent thread on lkml, you may want to
read up on that. Basically using splice for network receive is a bit of
a work-around now, since you do need the one copy and then vmsplice that
into a pipe. To realize the full potential of splice, we first need
socket receive support so you can skip that step (splice from socket to
pipe, splice pipe to file).
There was no test code attached, btw.
