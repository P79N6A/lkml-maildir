I need help, First I am not a kernel hacker or a programmer, but I have
asked this question on the Debian mail lists without any answers and have
also e-mail the writer of the driver but the mail comes back so I am turning
to the kernel-list for some help.
 I can not get my scsi hd to work with my tekram dc-390u2w controller and
the sym53c8xx_2 driver under kernel-2.6.2. Everything works great using
kernel-2.4.28 and sym53c8xx driver so I know this is not a hardware issue
with the disk. I have built the sym53c8xx_2 driver into the kernel and have
tried every boot prompt command I could (getting them from the
sym53c8xx_2.txt included with the kernel doc's. This is an external drive
that has /var and /tmp mounted on, so needless to say my system does not
work properly. I have tried Googleing but no luck there either. Could
someone please help shed some light on this as I can't handle to many more
sleepless nights:)
Thanks
Brad
