Ok, you asked for it:
I _think_ it should be possible to do entirely in userspace by using
code similar to scarabd (
ftp://pc110.ro.nu/pub/scarab/
) and
scsi-generic layer
(/usr/src/linux/Documentation/scsi-generic.txt). Performance of this
hack will not be the best under the sun, but it should work well
enough to be usefull. Once it works, port into kernelspace should not
be too hard.
