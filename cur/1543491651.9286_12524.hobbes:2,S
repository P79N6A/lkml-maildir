Come on peoples, give Stallman a break.  At least the Operating System I
use, is called "Debian GNU/Linux", and as far as i'm concered, thats the
way it should be!  So for all you bigots out there with nothing better to
do than shoot down one of the biggest, if not THE BIGGEST, name in the
Free Software revolution, go f*ck yourselves, and your egos!!
Linux would not exist without the GNU tools, for starters, there would be
nothing to compile it with!
As I am just purely disgusted with some of the attitudes coming from
ignorant people, who dare to talk down to someone who deserves much more
than shameful loudmouths who do nothing but give free software a bad name.
I thought I should post my 2 cents worth..
RMS.. I salute you!! :)
