What kernel version are you using?  It normally works the first time for 
me, I put it in my startup scripts, as one of the last items.  However, if 
I change it a few times, it will hang and there is no way to reboot except 
via SYSRQ or pressing the reboot button on the machine.
This seems to be true of 2.6.19.1 and 2.6.19.2, I did not try under 
2.6.20-rc5 because I am tired of hanging my machine :)
