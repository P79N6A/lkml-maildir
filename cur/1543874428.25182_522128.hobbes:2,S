OK, I stress-tested this for about 9 hours - apparently this resolves the issues
I was seeing both with hotplug device unregister and module removal.
This is an old bug, but somehow it did not trigger on
older kernels - some code restructuring in infiniband is probably
the reason - so from that POV it's a regression in 2.6.21.
So now several people are experiencing these crashes.
David, Alexey, what do you think about this patch? Is it right?
Could this patch be considered for 2.6.21?

Additionally, ip over infiniband actually tests a separate flag
IPOIB_FLAG_ADMIN_UP before looking at an skb.
This flag is cleared before the device goes down.
Taken together this should be sufficient I think.
