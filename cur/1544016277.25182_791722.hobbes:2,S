Rather than polishing a turd, can we rename this "special" stuff to
something more descriptive? I'm not the only person to complain
about this. How about async_schedule_list()?
After all, async_schedule_list() describes *exactly* how it is
different to async_schedule(), while the "_special" keywords really
suck when you consider code is supposed to be self documenting....

And I think that description proves my point about the real
meaning of "special" in this API.
Cheers,
Dave.
