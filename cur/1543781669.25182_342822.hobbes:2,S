It was made this way to make Russell more open to it. I have since not
recieved any more comments from him so I figured I could pass it by you
instead to get more wide spread testing. The long term goal was removing
the config and having it on all the time.

Removing it would be preferable by me. All that #ifdef tends to clutter
up the code. After som initial problem with a buggy card everything has
worked flawlesly.
