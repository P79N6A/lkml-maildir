Dear list,
we've recetly tried to migrate from 2.4.26-grsec to 2.6.8.1, but it
has failed miserably.
when using 2.4.26, we can achieve 500-600mbit/sec throughput through our
e1000, but when using 2.6.8.1 it has dropped down to around 100mbit/sec
(with 100% cpu usage, no idle time [while at least with 2.4 we had some],
cpu usage grows while we dont shut the box down..)
it's a supermicro x5dp8 board, with e7505, adaptec 7902, using aacraid
scsiraid as the disk subsystem.
any thoughts?
please cc me, as I'm not subscribed.
regards,
