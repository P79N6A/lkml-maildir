Well, that's not a limit on how much memory you can map, it's a limit  
on how many pages you can lock into memory (as in, cannot be swapped  
out or written back to disk and reused).  For low-latency  
applications (IE: cd burning) you need to have all memory mlocked so  
that you don't get a low-latency wakup and then promptly lose all  
latency guarantees by swapping madly, but something like CUPS doesn't  
have a problem because it doesn't use mlock() or mlockall().
