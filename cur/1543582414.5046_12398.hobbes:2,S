        Should this onboard audio work with the i810 driver, in 2.2.x
and 2.4.x ?
  The card is detected as ICH2, although the driver supports only ICH.

Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.17, 17:24:05 Feb 17 2001
PCI: Increasing latency timer of device 00:fd to 64
i810: Intel ICH2 found at IO 0xef00 and 0xe800, IRQ 9
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, vendor id1: 0x4144, id2: 0x5360 (Analog
Devices AD1885)
i810_audio: Codec refused to allow VRA, using 48Khz only.
i810_audio: Found 1 audio device(s).

As seen above, playback is supported only for 48khz samples.
 If this is supposed to happen, is there a plan to support this
version as well ?
