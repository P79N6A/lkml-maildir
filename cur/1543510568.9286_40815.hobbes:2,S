another crash occured to me about 1 hour ago. i was editing 1(or 3?) small
(about 2K each) file(s) on NFS filesystem + one HTML page + images  opened
from it (as file, not through HTTP). when i run script, which worked with
files on mentioned NFS filesystem, my machine stopped (total freez or
what's the proper name for it). no messages in logs and console has been
unaccesible (no responses to Alt+Ctrl+Fx, ...).
some details (do not know whether it helps): files edited were opened in
joe editors, my script uses them as input and script produces resulting
HTML page which were opened in netscape.
