The new way is faster to read and understand when you consider
that this code isn't all alone. With the new way, my editor can
display 300% more code. This reduces screen-to-brain latency by
reducing the need to scroll.
Scrolling kills productivity.
I'd really rant if I still used a VT100 or the Linux console.
The new way better even if it didn't save space. It clearly
expresses that _something_, to be chosen based on the copy function,
will be returned. This isn't a case of one code path that returns
and one that does lots of other stuff. Hey, be glad the ?: operator
didn't get nested a few times, maybe with the comma operator thrown
in for extra fun. You just have to get used to it.
