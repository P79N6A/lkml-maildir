Its not the proper fix. The latest patch fixes this problem. I had to save 
the area under the cursor and redraw that area when the cursor was 
disabled or moved. The cursor api is set in stone from the drivers 
prespective. So it will be easy for driver writers to make use of 
a hardware cursor. The old cursor code was written around a software 
emulated cursor. The new code favors hardware cursors with software 
emulation the exception.
