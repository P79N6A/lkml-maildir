OK, I'm with you, hi-res timer.
But even so, how is the time in the past after adding a second.
Is it because I'm not setting tv_nsec when it's close to a second

people that logged the problem to test a patch.

I'm happy to change automount but that could cause odd version specific
problems for people updating their kernel on an older installed base.
Aaah .. and they'll all blame me!! ;)
