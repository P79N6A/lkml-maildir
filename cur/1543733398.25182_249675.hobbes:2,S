then calltrace about mingetty *checks logs* (nothing in logs :( )
now mingetty behaves, but about half an hour ago i had just "upgraded"
my installation's xfree packages (debian sid) i was switching windows in
screen, and as soon as a i had switched from irssi to mutt, the uxterm
the screen session was running in crashed. did the same with mc, too. 
kernel version involved is 2.6.8.1
