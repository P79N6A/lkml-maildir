   I don't think the flush_dcache_page thing is done almost anywhere in the 
   block/driver level right now.
It isn't and it shouldn't :-)
   And we shouldn't be doing io reads to pagecache pages with user
   mappings anyway normally. direct-io is a different thing.
We are talking about the case where we are bringing in the
data for the first time, on the page cache lookup miss.
