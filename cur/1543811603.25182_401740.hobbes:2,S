Besides the paths we're counting and the one's Arjan listed below, are 
there others
you had in mind ?

Our intent was to get an idea of user-initiated sync block I/O because
there is some expectation from user space that a higher I/O priority will
result in lower delays for such I/O. General throttling writes wouldn't 
fit in
this category though msync and O_SYNC would.
Are there a lot of other paths you see ? I'll root around more but if you
could just list a few more, it'll help.
As for the level at which the counting is being done, the reason for
choosing this one was to avoid counting time spent waiting for async I/O
completion and also to keep the accounting simple (diff of two 
timestamps without
modifying block I/O structures).
To our usage model, async I/O is also not as useful to be counted since 
userspace has already
taken steps to tolerate the latency and can do useful work (and not be 
"delayed").
However, I would  have liked to capture the time spent within 
sys_io_getevents
when a timeout is specified, since there the user is again going to be 
delayed,
but the mingling of block and network I/O events makes that more complex.
Going further down the I/O processing stack than the current level would
probably require more elaborate mechanisms to keep track of the submitter ?
Or is there a better merging point for sync I/O that I'm missing ?
Your comments would be welcome to improve this code...
