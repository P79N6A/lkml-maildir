We're slowly standardising at least some of our namespace problems.
The condition codes are all migrating to SAM_STAT_ prefix, so
CHECK_CONDITION becomes SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION (and gets shifted in
the process).
We still have a nasty namespace pollution problem on the SCSI commands
though and cleaning this up is problematic since they permeate not just
SCSI but large areas of other drivers as well.
