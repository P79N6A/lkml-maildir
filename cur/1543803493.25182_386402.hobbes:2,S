I think I am recalling some problems on ppc82xx, when e100 was stuck on startup,
and eepro100 worked just fine. 
Even if the patch below will be scheduled for application, we need to set up enough time 
for approval that e100 will be fine for all the up-to-date hw; or it should be fixed/updated before eepro100 removal.
