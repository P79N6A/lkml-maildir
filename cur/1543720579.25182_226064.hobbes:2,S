Subject: [PATCH] writeback_inodes can race with unmount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

There's a small window where the filesystem can be unmounted during
writeback_inodes.  The end result is the iput done by sync_sb_inodes
could be done after the FS put_super and and the super has been removed
from all lists.
The fix is to hold the s_umount sem during sync_sb_inodes to make sure
the FS doesn't get unmounted.
