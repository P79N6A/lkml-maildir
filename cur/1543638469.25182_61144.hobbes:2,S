Alan, in your PnP patches you seem to have changed the 
	"set_limit()"
to a 
	"_set_limit()"
which looks wrong (or at least doesn't look consistent with the notion of 
just doing the same code as before, except on all CPU's).
It _looks_ to me like the QX_SET_SET() macros should be have the "_" 
removed from the set_limit part. As it is, _set_limit() gets the address 
calculations wrong (because you don't cast it to "char *") and also gets 
the limit wrong (because you no longer do the page size adjustment).
Does it work with that small change? I have no idea about the pnpbios 
code, I'm just looking at Alan's diff.
