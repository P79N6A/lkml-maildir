May be the simpler solution is to use separate variables to control
ratelimit and write chunk?
writeback_set_ratelimit() adjusts ratelimit_pages to avoid too frequent
calls to balance_dirty_pages(), but once we are inside of
writeback_inodes(), there is no need to write especially many pages in
one go: overhead of any additional looping is negligible, when compared
with the cost of writing.
Speaking of which, now that expensive get_writeback_state() is gone from
page-writeback.c why do we need adjustable ratelimiting at all? It looks
like writeback_set_ratelimit() can be dropped, and fixed ratelimit used
instead.
Nikita.
