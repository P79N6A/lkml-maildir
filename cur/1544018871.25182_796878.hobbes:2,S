I may have missed something important here, but how does your suggestion remove
the need for recursively locking inodes?
In configfs_rmdir(), we do not need to lock default groups inodes to prevent
racing mkdir() under them. This race is already dealt with earlier in
configfs_detach_prep(), which tries to set the CONFIGS_USET_DROPPING flag on the
group to remove and on all its hierarchy of default groups, protected by
configfs_dirent_lock. The matching logic in configfs_mkdir() may look a bit
burried but is simple: configfs_attach_item()/configfs_attach_group() eventually
calls configfs_new_dirent(), which fails whenever the parent is tagged with
CONFIGFS_USET_DROPPING. Again, no inode locking is required for this logic.
However configfs_rmdir() and configfs_mkdir() (recursively) lock inodes because
this is how the VFS works when removing/adding entries under a directory which
has already lived in the dcache.

Louis
