Hello,
I'd like to work on the new filesystem (i.e. the one that will provide
Really Nice Things like journalling, resize-while-mounted, et cetera).
Can someone provide me with pointers to existing work on this (or tell
me if there is none)?
In addition, any pointers to documentation on the `proper' way to do
a journalled filesystem would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Joshua.
