Hum, interesting, I didn't know you could run both servers at the same
time. The problem is that the old server is not being developed any more,
as dully advised on the 2.2.18 kernel help messages. In fact, we have been
having some problems with it for some time, I/O errors and mounts hanging,
mostly. In fact, upgrading to 2.2.18 broke old NFS exports in some cases
around here, until we migrated to knfsd: gave us sure-fire I/O errors and
hangs. So this might be a stopgap measure for some time, but no permanent
solution. In any case, knfsd seems so much more solid, we want to use it!

I'm afraid you lost me here... If this would have to be some kind of new
daemon or kernel module that filters out NFS packets and forwards them,
wouldn't this be equivalent to making knfsd do the same thing? Humm, on
second thoughts, maybe not, because this beast would not have to interpret
the mount as a filesystem on the front end. Am I following you correctly?
