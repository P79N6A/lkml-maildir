Subject: remove unnecessary BIOS reserved resources

e820 BIOS reserved memory ranges can be incorrect.  Even when the ranges
are correct, once they are entered into iomem_resource with
request_resorce() the ranges prevent drivers from registering the same
ranges.
Not registering the ranges shouldn't break anything - some BIOSes don't
even report _any_ reserved ranges and the kernel works just fine.  This
patch drops registration of e820 BIOS reserved ranges.  The patch should
apply to 2.4.x and 2.6.

Anyone have reasons why this shouldn't be applied?
