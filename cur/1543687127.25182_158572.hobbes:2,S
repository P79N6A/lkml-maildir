Hi Pete,
That would be totally messy. Having drivers do the accounting of what
mask is currently set and have them switch back and forth depending on
what type of allocation is currently being used would be a nightmare
to debug.

The thing is that we really want to do 32-bit allocations for
consistent allocations if we can in anyway do it since it means the
card can do SAC for all access to control structures. However as you
mention there are cases where this isn't possible and we will have to
take the hit of DAC cycles.
Cheers,
Jes
