I don't think that Linus Torvalds is ready to see the notion of thread id
to invade the kernel (and I think he is right). The PID should be enough
for what we want to do in user space. I just think that we should be able
to hide from a user space program the fact that the POSIX semantics wants
to attribute 1 PID to all threads to a program. Maybe, this should all be
done in user space (comments Ulrich ?) by wrapping all system calls returning
PID in their data. The main drawback I see for this is that each time a
new system call return PID, the libpthread should also be aligned to wrap
it. This is the reason why I think it is better to do this wrapping inside
the kernel.
BTW, If the fact that getpid() is a CLONE_PID rule exception hurts you,
then a simple way to avoid such is to return 2 pids (as for fork):
1) the standard one (which is the one potentially fixed by CLONE_PID), and
2) the effective one (as seen by the kernel).
