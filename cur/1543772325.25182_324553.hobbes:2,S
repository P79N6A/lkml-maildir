I tried the scanning program on localhost. I modified it to wait for the 
user to press Enter when it encounters an open port.
On my system I normally have listening TCP ports 25, 631 and 1024.
And yes, the scanning program sometimes finds other open ports.
This is netstat output when it happens:
michich@michichnb:~> LC_ALL=C netstat -ntp | grep scan
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
  will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
tcp  0  0  127.0.0.1:1774   127.0.0.1:1774     ESTABLISHED 17510/scan
The TCP socket connected to itself. I don't know if it's expected 
behaviour. It agree it is strange, because we didn't call listen() on 
the socket.
