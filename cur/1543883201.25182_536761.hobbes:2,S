I reviewed the code once more and find it OK. There is only one legal
value for the parameter "count" of uio_read(), and that's sizeof(int).
The data that is actually read is the element "event" of struct uio_device,
which is of type atomic_t. The latter has the size of an int.
Unfortunately, the fact that the read count _must_ be sizeof(int) is not
mentioned in the documentation. I'll send a patch for that ASAP.

This patch should fix it:
