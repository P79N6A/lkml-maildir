Hi,
after installation of kernel 2.4.12 (migrated from 2.4.10
by "make oldconfig"), having problems when logging in on
a virtual console:
It sems that there is no correct tty attached to the console:
1. the ps command lists _all_ processes actually running under
   the correspondent userid and only those running under
   the login shell.
2. Starting a ssh command for some other box is rejected
   by
                You have no controlling tty and no DISPLAY.
                Cannot read passphrase.
I never had such problems when running 2.4.10 kernel.
Regards
Joachim Backes
