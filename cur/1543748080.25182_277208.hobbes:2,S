Yeah, it looks like the problem for sure.  The patch modifies the
structure "inet_dgram_ops" to use udp_poll(), but looking farther down:
static struct inet_protosw inetsw_array[] =
[...]
                .type =       SOCK_DGRAM,
                .protocol =   IPPROTO_UDP,
                .prot =       &udp_prot,
                .ops =        &inet_dgram_ops,
[...]
               .type =       SOCK_RAW,
               .protocol =   IPPROTO_IP,        /* wild card */
               .prot =       &raw_prot,
               .ops =        &inet_dgram_ops,
[...]
so it looks like udp_poll() will end up getting used for both SOCK_DGRAM
and SOCK_RAW inet sockets; obviously Poptop is using the latter and failing
as a result.  No need for the strace/tcpdump data I guess.
The fix is to just make a copy of the inet_dgram_ops called inet_udp_ops
and make the udp_poll() change only in that one (and obviously change the
SOCK_DGRAM case there to use &inet_udp_ops).  I don't have time right this
second to spin a patch, but could you try that out and see if it fixes
your problem.
