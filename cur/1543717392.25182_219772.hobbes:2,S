indeed. If the removal didnt succeed then we must make sure there's no
timer fn pending. Btw., in that case del_timer_sync() must not succeed -
it would mean the timer fn re-added the timer, which by definition must
not happen here. So i'd go for:
int del_single_shot_timer(struct timer_struct *timer)
{
	int ret = del_timer(timer);
	if (!ret) {
		ret = del_timer_sync(timer);
		BUG_ON(ret);
	}
	return ret;
}
this should catch illegal uses of del_single_shot_timer().
