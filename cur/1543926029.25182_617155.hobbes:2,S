Careful, it looks like you cherry picked commit 4ae3f847 "md: raid5:
fix clearing of biofill operations" which ended up misapplied in
Linus' tree,  You should either also pick up def6ae26 "md: fix
misapplied patch in raid5.c" or I can resend the original "raid5: fix
clearing of biofill operations."
The other patch for -stable "raid5: fix unending write sequence" is
currently in -mm.
