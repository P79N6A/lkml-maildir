Do you mean "as it was in July"? I haven't been sitting on my hands
since July :)  My wife will testify to that!
I've been working on implementing the last new features I want in,
fixing bugs and generally making it as stable and reliable as I can.
(Sorry Andrew, but I'm being a perfectionist). At the same time, many of
the parts that made Suspend2 be considered huge and ugly have been
merged. The pm_message_t stuff, for example, was adopted early by
Suspend2 and part of those stats you saw in July. The patch currently
still includes the workqueue nofreeze patch, Christoph's todo list
freezer modifications. These account for virtually all of the changes
outside of kernel/power.
I've also split the one patch that most people see into what is
currently about 225 smaller patches, each adding only one small part, am
writing descriptions for them all and am preparing to build a git tree
from it.
Hopefully that shows that I am working toward merging, just maybe not in
the way that you were imagining. You'll remember that I've argued before
that trying to patch swsusp into Suspend2 is infeasible. I'm not even
trying to do it.
Regards,
Nigel
