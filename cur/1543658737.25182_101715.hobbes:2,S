These files include the ipv6 and VERIFY_* stuff unconditionally. _EVERY_
caller must know to include the in6.h/uaccess.h header files simply to get
it to compile. This is what the net/checksum.h file does. There are 31 files
including <asm/checksum.h> directly, and all of these _must_ track down the
dependencies by hand.
This isn't a _want_, it's an unconditional requirement. The files are broken.

Of course, it's really C's bug, by doing brain-dead textual inclusion.
Trust me, I know the difficulties in managing #includes.
