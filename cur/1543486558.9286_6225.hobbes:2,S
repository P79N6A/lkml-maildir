After looking at this source file you mentioned, I found that it determined
the range of safe ports to use for automagic port assignments by looking at
sysctl_local_port_range[0] and sysctl_local_port_range[1] which can be
modified from user space via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
It would be nice if I could make attempts to bind redirected ports return
EINVAL or whatever, but this is good enough for now.
