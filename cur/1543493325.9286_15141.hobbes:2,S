Yes.  Step one: Add performance metrics collection to the kernel.  I've
been working on this for a few weeks.  I've got a good start on disk stats.
There was some talk about system call accounting last week.  The cleanest
place to add this is in assembly code which I'm not qualified to modify.
(I don't find the number of system calls a particularly interesting number,
but it should be there for correlation purposes.)
If there are more people making changes to this end, we should get together
(probably off this list) to discuss our work.  I'm not doing this as
sanctioned work for my employer.  It's a personal goal.
