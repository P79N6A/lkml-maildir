But that "copy Module.symvers from module A to module B" does not work in
these situations:
1) Module B does not know where module A source is.
2) Automatic package builder box may remove all traces of module A before
   module B is built.
3) Automatic package builder box may build module B before module A.
How about this:
    make M=/path/to/dir IGNORE_MISSING_SYMVER_ERRORS=1 modules
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Meaning: If symbol version is available, fine, use that. If some info is not
available, that is fine too. Just make it work without symbol versioning.
Killing those damn error messages should be enough.
