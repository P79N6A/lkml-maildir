Hello Dries,
Thanks for your reply, but as it looks a lot like the same problem, I
want to mention that we do NOT have a Dell system here. It is a
Fujitsu Siemens i945 motherboard. I also saw the problem about "long
delays during boot by hwclock" on an old i845 Kontron Motherboard,
running the same installation/kernel as I mentioned, which we were
using for years and never showed this problems until we start using
this kernel. The RTC clock that was stopped is only seen twice on this
Fujitsu siemens board, not on any other.
So, as it is not a Dell system ,and we therefor have a different BIOS,
I doubt it is BIOS related. Further, I discovered that the problem
also occured in a system that is not tickless. I can therefor exclude
now that it is NOT related to the CONFIG_NO_HZ option, despite what I
mentioned in my previous mail.
In my case it also was NO battery problem, but removing the battery
was the only way to reset the RTC to get it ticking again.
We have enabled HPET in BIOS and kernel.
I have tested the 2.6.20rc3-rt0 kernel of Ingo (as he suggested) by
booting it a few times, and until now we have not seen this problem,
but the long term will learn if it is really gone.
Kind Regards,
Remy Böhmer
