No, it was quite intentional.  It's replaced by the segment pointed at
when running the kernel.  This is to keep things from crashing with a
huge EBDA.  THIS IS A VERY NECESSARY CHANGE.
The only way it should affect zImage is if you're loading your zImage
start address at something other than 0x90000, in which case you have
a smaller space anyway.
Saying "zImage won't go away" may be true (although I definitely wish
it wasn't so), but boot loaders probably will start to drop zImage
support, because of the hideous pain it takes to support them cleanly
in a way that makes sense at all.  SYSLINUX simply load them high and
copy them down before starting the kernel -- anything else is too
painful.
