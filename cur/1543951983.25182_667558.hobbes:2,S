*Snort*
How about "the first entry returned by getdents(3) after open() is a whiteout
for e.g. '.'"?  No fstat needed, zero impact for normal directories,
zero impact for any binaries on old kernels (where you wouldn't have
unions) and zero impact for old binaries on new kernels unless they
do getdents() on directory that happens to be a union.
And no lockstep...

It won't, kernel-side or done in userland.

Actually, do we really need it other than to 0 and to current position
(i.e. full rewind and a no-op)?
