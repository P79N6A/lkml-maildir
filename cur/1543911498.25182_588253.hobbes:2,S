I'd think that passing the raw error code is a bad idea, and that you
probably want to have your own set of codes that you use in the trasport and
map value to/from the host's errno values.

Yep, and it kind of sucks.

I wouldn't - Linux on different different architectures seems to have
different errno codes.

It would break userspace :-/
