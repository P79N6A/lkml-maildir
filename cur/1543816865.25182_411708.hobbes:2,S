Not sure if I follow you here.  I think you are suggesting for  
ds1672_get_control to look like:
static int ds1672_get_control(struct i2c_client *client, u8 *status)
{
         unsigned char addr = DS1672_REG_CONTROL;
         struct i2c_msg msgs[] = {
                 { client->addr, 0, 1, &addr },          /* setup  
read ptr */
                 { client->addr, I2C_M_RD, 1, status },  /* read  
control */
         };
...
}
which is fine.  Any suggestions on what to do on an error in the  
sysfs attrib function?
