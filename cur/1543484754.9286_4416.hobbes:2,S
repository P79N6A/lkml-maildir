Ahh, thanks. I was convinced for some reason that this couldn't happen
because we held the parent semaphore, but you're obviously right: even
though we hold the parent semaphore it only means that the directory
itself cannot be looked up, but somebody who already has the directory
looked up (in cwd or similar) wouldn't need to care. 
Anyway, the patch looks correct, although I have to admit that it starts
to smell like this should all be done in common code at the VFS layer
rather than each filesystem having to know about this fairly subtle race. 
I designed the VFS locking exactly in such a way that the filesystems
themselves wouldn't have to care about the directory tree consistency
issues. 
Would you mind looking into something like that? I'd be grateful,
		Linus
