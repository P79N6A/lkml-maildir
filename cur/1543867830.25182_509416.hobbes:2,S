What is ugly abt kthread_stop in workqueue.c?
I feel it is nice if the cleanup is synchronous i.e when cpu_down() is
complete, all the dead cpu's worker threads would have terminated.
Otherwise we expose races between CPU_UP_PREPARE/kthread_create and the
(old) thread exiting.

wait_to_die is not a new "hack"! Its already used in several other
places ..

and try to kthread_stop() uninitialized cwq->thread?
How abt retaining the break above but setting cwq->thread = NULL in
create_workqueue_thread in failure case?

This is required if we want to stop per-cpu threads synchronously.

Ok yes ..thanks for pointing out!
