Due to wiki based DOS attacks on this Linux project server, the wiki 
server and ftp server are password protected at wolfmountaingroup.org.  
Anyone interested in testing the code on Linux or helping with the Linux 
design please email me and we will review your request and forward to 
the project members for inclusion.  Either myself or another admin can 
grant you access.   Please place in the subject of the email [WOLF 
MOUNTAIN] so we know it's someone asking for access to this server.   
Thanks,
Jeff
