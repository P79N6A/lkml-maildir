Please verify the problem still exists in the latest 2.6.21 git.
If yes, please file a bug here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
For 2.6.20.stable, please attach
the complete output from dmesg -s64000
output from acpidump
output from lspci -vv
and paste a copy of /proc/interrupts
For 2.6.21.broken, please attach as much
of the dmesg as you can capture, and the /proc/interrupts
if you can get that far.
thanks,
-Len
