It has always been the standard for all modems. The mistake comes from the
fact that the serial ports has been used extensively to drive things which
are *not* modems (say, printers and VT100 consoles on Unix systems). Such
devices did not need the standard-specified RTS function.
CCITT V24 says about RTS: "...this signal drives the DCE and sets it to
transmit data..." (translated from french)
CCITT V24 does not constraint the DCE to being half or full duplex.
CCITT V24 says nothing about using RTS to handle flow control.

Even Windows implements the CCITT view of RTS, via a flag named "RTS_TOGGLE"

A full duplex port can be used for both full- and half- duplex. A half
duplex modem cannot be used on a full-duplex-only port. So Linux should be
adapted to the standard, since we cannot adapt the standard to Linux.

Then sysfs sounds good to me.

Another flag would help to drive modems, yes. But it would not help keeping
RTS low at open, because we need to open the port (which raises RTS) in
order to set the flag. Hence the need for an extra parameter in sysfs.
