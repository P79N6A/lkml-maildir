Yes.
OK, I think I've sorted it out.  The solution is to use your patch and the
following change against swsusp.c:
--- linux-2.6.11-rc3-mm1-orig/kernel/power/swsusp.c	2005-02-08 18:16:34.000000000 +0100
+++ new/kernel/power/swsusp.c	2005-02-09 17:31:16.000000000 +0100
@@ -870,7 +870,9 @@
 	/* Restore control flow magically appears here */
 	restore_processor_state();
 	restore_highmem();
+	touch_softlockup_watchdog();
 	device_power_up();
+	touch_softlockup_watchdog();
 	local_irq_enable();
 	return error;
 }
Greets,
Rafael
