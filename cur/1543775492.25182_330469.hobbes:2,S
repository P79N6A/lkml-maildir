I don't see why /auto is special.  It's basically a userspace
filesystem too, but that's not what is specaial about FUSE.  It's the
fact the it's a userspace filesystem controlled by an _ordinary user_.

I believe it _is_ something new.  If it were not, then your arguments
would be bulletproof.  As it is, I think you miss the point that the
side effect is actually in the hands of the user invoking the suid
program, instead of something external.

Yes.

Yes.  In fact even if the check were left out of the kernel, the
userspace filesystem could still return different data/error based on
fsuid/fsgid/pid.
So what's so controversial about it?  I really fail to understand...

It's not as simple.  A filesystem can be mounted many times (either
with mount --bind, or just by mounting the same device on multiple
mountpoints).  In this case you can't ensure, that a mountpoint will
remain a leaf node after being mounted on.
