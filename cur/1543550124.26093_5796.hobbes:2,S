No. I'm agains using subsets of languages. Use it all, or don't use it.
The last thing we want here is a 'Well, I used an exception handler, and
it ate my primary disk. How come ??' -> 'Well, the docs say you can't use
exception handlers in kernel space'.
Just to give an example.

I'm not against C++.. It can make code readable and maintainable.

That means you trowing a big part of things that make C++ so usefull. With
such restrictions I would probably use straight C.
