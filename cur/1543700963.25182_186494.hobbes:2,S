Yes, it lasts for about 5 seconds then continues as normal. The problem
then re-occurs about 1.5-2.5 minutes after that. The recurrence after
that becomes harder to predict.
Interestingly, if you leave XMMS playing long enough (over an hour) such
as listening to a vorbis radio stream, it finally goes into permanent
break-up mode. It's so bad that you really have to stop playing and
start again (no need to shut down XMMS though).
