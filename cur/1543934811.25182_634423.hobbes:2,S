Hi,
kexec of 2.6.24-rc6-git11 fails for me with:
Close of /boot/kernel-2.6.24-rc6-git11 failed: : buffer error
kexec load failed, error = 1
2.6.24-rc6-git9 works as expected.  git10 fails with root device
not found (for some reason).  All have the same kernel config
(attached).
Any ideas/suggestions?
Thanks,
---
