Hi Stephen,
I would like to update the "The development process" section in
Documentation/HOWTO including some information about the linux-next tree.
I understand what it's including but I didn't get how it will fit in
the process.
Is Linus going to pull from that tree as soon as we reach -rc0 or this
is just a tree
used for testing what will be pushed to Linus as soon as the two weeks
merge window
open?
Thanks.
Ciao,
