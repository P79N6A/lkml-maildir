That is why you are not allowed to depend on main system's allocator
problems. That is why network can have it's own allocator.

No, you can't since openssh and any other priveledge separation
mechanisms use adtional sockets to transfer data between it's parts,
unix sockets require page sized allocation frequently which will endup
with 8k allocation in slab.
You will not be able to login using openssh.
