Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.42, cciss, no scsi tape timeouts (1 of 7)

I have re-done our cciss patches for 2.5.42, and reordered them so that 
smaller/simpler/important ones are first, bigger more complicated/less 
important ones are last to make them easier to swallow.
Here's the first:  patch (1 of 7) 
This patch eliminates the timeout on scsi commands to tape drives.
The driver doesn't do anything good if the command times out, and the
timeout is too short.  Better to have no timeout.
