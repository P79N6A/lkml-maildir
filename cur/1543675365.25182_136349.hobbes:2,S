btw, I already fixed this race in my tree:
void blkdev_release_request(struct request *req)
{
	request_queue_t *q = req->q;
	req->rq_status = RQ_INACTIVE;
	req->q = NULL;
	/*
	 * Request may not have originated from ll_rw_blk. if not,
	 * assume it has free buffers and check waiters
	 */
	if (q) {
		list_add(&req->queue, &q->rq.free);
		if (++q->rq.count >= q->batch_requests && !blk_oversized_queue_batch(q)) {
			smp_mb();
			if (waitqueue_active(&q->wait_for_requests))
				wake_up(&q->wait_for_requests);
so if this was this one my tree wouldn't exibith it (and it would
trigger on smp only).
