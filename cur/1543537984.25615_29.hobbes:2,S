   I didn't know that the irq_restore() for a given irq_save() must
   also be performed in the context of the same function. Thanks for
   the information.  Is it related to the flags containing
   informations about function's local resources ? (registers used,
   ...)
The flags holds also the Sparc current register window in use.  So if
you restore it in a different function, this would clobber all the
registers.
Later,
