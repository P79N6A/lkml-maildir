Ummm... What Alan's saying is:
1) Whatever driver is trying to shut down from IRQ context
   is broken must be fixed.  pci_pool is fine.
2) The Documentation/ files which suggest that such device
   removal from IRQs is "OK" must be fixed because it is not
   "OK" to handle device removal from IRQ context.
So Pete's change is not needed.  A fix for the documentation and
broken drivers is needed instead.
Later,
