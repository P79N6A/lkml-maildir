Ok. Another case.
2.2.10 and up and 2.3.12 and up. Using LVM 0.7.
Machine is a Dual PPro (yes SMP!) 166Mhz/512, 128Mb of RAM.
SCSI controller is a NCR875.
I've got one LV of 1Gb striped over 4 disks. The stripesize is 4. When I
compile the kernel on this LV using make -j3 after a while I see these
"write beyond end of device" messages. Later the machine will indefinately
hang. Keyboard works, disk access isn't possible. 
Hope this helps a little.
Best regards,
