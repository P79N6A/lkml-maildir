Yes, when we talked about it I checked a few Linux versions, Solaris 5.7, 5.8,
and Irix 6.5 and they all truncate.
So, the standard says "unspecified" but the industry consensus is clearly
"truncate", never mind the O_RDONLY.
Probably the "unspecified" is there for a good reason, so people should be
able to find systems that do not truncate, but there is no reason at all
for Linux to change behaviour.
