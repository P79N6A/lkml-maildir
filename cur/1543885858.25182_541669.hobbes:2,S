This looks reasonable.
I don't think a time field is necessary. In fact, I think the
scheduled_delayed_work() in tty_schedule_flip() should use a
time of 0 just like con_schedule_flip().
As the tty flip buffer code has evolved, that delay value of 1
was carried along. It may have had some historical purpose, but
I can't figure it out and it appears to have no use currently.
It would be better for performance to process the receive data
as soon as possible (delay value of 0).
