Well :-) that's sorta true. In the new world the old gods will fall to
give rise to new ones.  worshippers of root will fade in the echos of the
past ... Rootshunting is possible if the kernel so chooses. Trusted Linux,
which is my perosnal and favourite focus for linux would be an environment
without root.
