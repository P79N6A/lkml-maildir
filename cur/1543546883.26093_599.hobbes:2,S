<DIV><FONT face=MingLiu size=2>Dear Sirs,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=細明體 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=細明體 size=2>We are a leading anti-virus solution provider on 
Unix. Currently we are trying to port our products to Linux. Our products 
consist of some loadable kernel modules and daemons as well on Linux. The 
loadable kernel modules are called 'hooks', which will change the runtime values 
of sys_call_table[] of arch/i386/kernel/entry.S but never modify the copy of 
entry.S file on the hard disk. According to the following 'exceptions' of GPL, 
we want to know&nbsp;whether they won't be covered by GPL or not if we 
distribute the Linux kernel and then our products at different timepoints on the 
same host. Or is there any way else that they won't be covered by GPL? Your 
prompt reply is greatly appreciated.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=細明體>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be 
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this 
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them 
as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on 
the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
