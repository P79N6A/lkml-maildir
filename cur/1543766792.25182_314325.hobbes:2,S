If "register" and "unregister" is meant in the RDMA sense then the above
sequence is totally reasonable. The b) registration could be for a different
protection domain that did not require access to all of the larger region.
Unless a full counting lock is available from the kernel, the responsibility
of the collective RDMA components would be to a) pin 0x0000 to 0x2fff,
b) nothing c) unpin 0x000 to 0x0fff and 0x2000 to 0x2fff
