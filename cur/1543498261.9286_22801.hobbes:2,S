Yes of course, my patch triggers the bug but it's a bug in ext2fs (it's
present also in ufs and minix btw) and it's just been fixed in 2.3.x
infact.

I uploaded a 2.2.9_andrea-VM3.gz with the patch included.

Good idea, I'll set the distribution to 1, I don't want to lose because I
am more conservative in memory. Right now I am merging my stuff from Linus
and with his great Linus feedback I am changing many things, so when thing
will be into 2.3.x I'll produce a new worthwhile patch for 2.2.9 (or
against 2.2.10 if it will be the time).
