Internally I doubt it would make much difference.  There are
real differences from modifying current to copying from current.
Mostly it is ref counting but just enough that CLONE_SELF
is unlikely to be a sane thing to do.
Of course we could always implement spawn.  The syscall with
every possible option :)
