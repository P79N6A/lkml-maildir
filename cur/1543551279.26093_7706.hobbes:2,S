Again, you miss the entire point, which you brush upon here: Redhat 7.0
is supposed to be a 'stable' release, suddenly thousands of people have
been snagging the iso's for it, then there will be people who have
problems compiling new kernels for it and they'll have problems for it
once in awhile (i've seen quite a few cases reported on irc.. of
course, i refer them to this list).  Now, while this problem is being
worked on and will eventually be solved, it just doesn't seem like a
logical thing to me to call a buggy release 'stable'.  But then, it's
not my decision so I guess I'll just stop right there before someone
else decides to flame me. ;)

Considering he's already stated that he's reproduced this on a few
machines, I'd say that says it all right there.
