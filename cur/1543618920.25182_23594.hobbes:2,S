I think I can show that it's exactly as much copying as necessary, and no more.
Oh, the page directory could also be shared and, on a 3 level page table, so
could the mid level tables, but that's not a really big win because of the 1K/1
fanout.  I.e, we already took care of 99.9% of the problem just by sharing the
bottom-level page tables.
