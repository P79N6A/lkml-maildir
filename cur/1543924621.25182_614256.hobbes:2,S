A nearly 8 years old status and TODO list for the change to 32-bit UIDs
doesn't have much value.

-Notes on the change from 16-bit UIDs to 32-bit UIDs:
-
-- kernel code MUST take into account __kernel_uid_t and __kernel_uid32_t
-  when communicating between user and kernel space in an ioctl or data
-  structure.
-
-- kernel code should use uid_t and gid_t in kernel-private structures and
-  code.
-
-What's left to be done for 32-bit UIDs on all Linux architectures:
-
-- Disk quotas have an interesting limitation that is not related to the
-  maximum UID/GID. They are limited by the maximum file size on the
-  underlying filesystem, because quota records are written at offsets
-  corresponding to the UID in question.
-  Further investigation is needed to see if the quota system can cope
-  properly with huge UIDs. If it can deal with 64-bit file offsets on all 
-  architectures, this should not be a problem.
-
-- Decide whether or not to keep backwards compatibility with the system
-  accounting file, or if we should break it as the comments suggest
-  (currently, the old 16-bit UID and GID are still written to disk, and
-  part of the former pad space is used to store separate 32-bit UID and
-  GID)
-
-- Need to validate that OS emulation calls the 16-bit UID
-  compatibility syscalls, if the OS being emulated used 16-bit UIDs, or
-  uses the 32-bit UID system calls properly otherwise.
-
-  This affects at least:
-	SunOS emulation
-	Solaris emulation
-	iBCS on Intel
-
-	sparc32 emulation on sparc64
-	(need to support whatever new 32-bit UID system calls are added to
-	sparc32)
-
-- Validate that all filesystems behave properly.
-
-  At present, 32-bit UIDs _should_ work for:
-	ext2
-	ufs
-	isofs
-	nfs
-	coda
-	udf
-
-  Ioctl() fixups have been made for:
-	ncpfs
-	smbfs
-
-  Filesystems with simple fixups to prevent 16-bit UID wraparound:
-	minix
-	sysv
-	qnx4
-
-  Other filesystems have not been checked yet.
-
-- The ncpfs and smpfs filesystems cannot presently use 32-bit UIDs in
-  all ioctl()s. Some new ioctl()s have been added with 32-bit UIDs, but
-  more are needed. (as well as new user<->kernel data structures)
-
-- The ELF core dump format only supports 16-bit UIDs on arm, i386, m68k,
-  sh, and sparc32. Fixing this is probably not that important, but would
-  require adding a new ELF section.
-
-- The ioctl()s used to control the in-kernel NFS server only support
-  16-bit UIDs on arm, i386, m68k, sh, and sparc32.
-
-- make sure that the UID mapping feature of AX25 networking works properly
-  (it should be safe because it's always used a 32-bit integer to
-  communicate between user and kernel)
