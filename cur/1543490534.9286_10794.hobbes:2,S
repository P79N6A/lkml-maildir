There were several papers and works in progress at OSDI 99 that dealt
closely to this topic. It was a very interesting conference from this 
perspective.
There was:
"Automatic I/O Hint Generation Through Speculative Execution,
     Fay Chang, Garth A. Gibson, Carnegie Mellon University"
Then there was:
Virtual Log Based File Systems for a Programmable Disk
     Randolph Y. Wang, University of California, Berkeley; Thomas E.
     Anderson, University of Washington, Seattle; David A. Patterson,
     University of California, Berkeley
Then there was "Enriching the File System-Storage System Interface"
work-in-progress (Drew Roselli, Jeanna Neefe Matthews, Tom Anderson
(drew@cs.berkeley.edu) which talked about informing the storage subsystem
with info hints as for file block lifetime, etc... I think this might have
been what you were thinking of?
