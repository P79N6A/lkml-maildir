 This is humour, yeh ?
 I would be supprised if even sendmail assumed braindamage like the
above.
 For instance something that is pretty common is...
foo.example.com.         IN A 4.4.4.4
foo.example.com.         IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
foo.example.com.         IN MX 20 backup-mx1.example.com.
; This is really mail.example.org.
backup-mx1.example.com.  IN A 1.2.3.4
...another is to have "farms" of mail servers (the A record for the MX
has multiple entries).
 If it "broke" as you said, then a lot of mail wouldn't be being routed.
