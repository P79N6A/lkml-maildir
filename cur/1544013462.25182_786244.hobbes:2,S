I'm of two minds here, the only reason I didn't add NULL handling to %pI[46] and 
%pM is because they were previously printing values rather than pointers and
was guaranteed to never be null.  Also, with the current values, the output
is always a fixed-width for %pI6, %pM.  %pI4 can vary from 7-15 chars, but
[NULL] is only 6 chars (and obviously has a totally different format).
Of course it's hard to see how a caller could screw that up...but since I
didn't check everybody using it, I didn't risk it at the time.
On the other hand, I'm not sure if we want each %p formatting to have to deal
with its own null-formatting.
I'll do an audit of a handful of pI46, pM users currently, and try to find places were
a short string/completely different format string could cause problems...but
your patch is fine for today as all of the existing users [cs]houldn't be passing
in null anyways.
