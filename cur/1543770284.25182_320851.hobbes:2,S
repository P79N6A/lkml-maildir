OK, I have been trying to use request_firmware but it always fails with
return code -2. This is the code snippet below, any thoughts?
static struct device rbu_device_type;
static struct device rbu_device;
static int __init dcdrbu_init(void)
{
        int rc = 0;
        const struct firmware *fw;
        device_initialize(&rbu_device_type);
        device_initialize(&rbu_device);
        strncpy(rbu_device.bus_id,"dell_rbu.bin", BUS_ID_SIZE);
        strncpy(rbu_device_type.bus_id,"dell_rbu1.bin", BUS_ID_SIZE);
        rc = request_firmware(&fw, "dell_rbu_type", &rbu_device_type);
        if (rc) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "dcdrbu_init: Firmware 1 missing "
                        "%d\n", rc);
                return -EIO;
        }
        release_firmware(fw);
        rc = request_firmware(&fw, "dell_rbu_data", &rbu_device);
        if (rc) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "dcdrbu_init: Firmware 2 missing "
                        "%d\n", rc);
                return -EIO;
        }
        release_firmware(fw);
        return rc;
}
static __exit void dcdrbu_exit( void)
{
}
module_exit(dcdrbu_exit);
module_init(dcdrbu_init);
