I concur. This sounds correct.
There is an old (possibly made up) story about a user at an university who
typed an 'ls' on an NFS mounted volume on a workstation just as the
mainframe UNIX system died, and locked. The story goes that the mainframe
REALLY died, and had to be shipped in twenty boxes back to the
manufacturer. Once there they were reeassembed, fixed, tested, had the
system restored from tape, broken down again, reshipped back to the
University and reassembed.
The story finishes that when the switch was flipped back on, and the
system booted, the 'ls' command finished, 1 month after it was typed,
since the workstation was never restarted or shutdown.
Take it for what it's worth....
