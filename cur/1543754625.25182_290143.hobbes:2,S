The sbp2 subsystem has stability problems, but I'm not exactly sure what
they are.  The core also has a few issues, but I don't think they'll
affect you.  This assumes you're running the latest from linux1394.org
svn as there are quite a few unmerged changes (which will hopefully make
it in to 2.6.12).

Having lots of devices shouldn't make any difference, one way or the
other.  62 devices is full.  For performance reasons, a tree topology is
preferred to daisy chaining all the devices.

Again, it shouldn't matter.  I'm not sure if the SCSI subsystem imposes
a limit on the number of drives.
I suggest asking future 1394 questions on one of the linux1394 lists:
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2252
  - someone may even have
tried what you're attempting.
