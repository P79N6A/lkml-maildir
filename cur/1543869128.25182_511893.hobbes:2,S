Unfortunately it was missing the report descriptor dump. The output should 
look like
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: report descriptor (size 59, read 59) = 05 01 
09 06 a1 01 05 07 19 e0 29 e7 15 00 25 01 75 01 95 08 81 02 81 03 95 05 05 
08 19 01 29 05 91 02 95 01 75 03 91 01 95 06 75 08 15 00 26 a4 00 05 07 19 
00 2a a4 00 81 00 c0
and it should appear as soon as you connect the device. If it didn't, I 
suspect that the 
	#define DEBUG_DATA
was not set properly in drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c (only defining DEBUG 
is not enough for report descriptor dump to appear).

But so far all reports that have gathered for this bug at me seem to come 
from FC6 ... does hid2hci by any chance in FC6 have any additional patches 
that could be causing it, instead of being a kernel issue?
