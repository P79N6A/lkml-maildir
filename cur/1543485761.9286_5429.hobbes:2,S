This is fixable from syslogd's perspective as well.  One of the
extensions that I incorporated into sysklogd was the ability to
selectively disable fsync'ing of logfiles on a per logfile basis.
This dramatically reduces load on busy servers with the nominal risk
of missing a line or two of log output in the event of system
problems.
The following exerpt is from one of the big IMAP servers at our local
university:
*.=info;*.=notice;cron.none;mail.none           /var/log/messages
*.=debug                                        /var/log/debug
*.warn                                          /var/log/syslog
mail.*                                          -/var/log/mail
With this configuration syslogd will fsync each line of output on all
the logfiles except for /var/log/mail.  This seems to dramatically
reduce system load and CPU consumption by syslogd in all cases where I
have used this directive.
