Hi,
I want to do this at the filesystem-level not in user-space.
I have a stackable-filesystem that runs as a layer on top of the
existing filesystem (with all the function pointers mapped to the
corresponding base filesystem function pointers, and other suitable
adjustments).
So yes I have access to the filesystem.
But the question is how can I access those particular data-blocks?
