Quick browse of the forum:

  How much of this is based on the reverse engineered Linux driver for
  forcedeth?

  It was consulted for register offsets and semantics if we weren't sure
  what was supposed to happen. If you look at the code you'll see our
  driver is a hell of a lot easier on the eyes and like half the size.
So yes, perhaps  'forcedeth'  driver would use some heavy handed
cleanup,  but it does not mean it does not exist...
