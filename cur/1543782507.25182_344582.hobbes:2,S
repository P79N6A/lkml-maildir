Actually, no.  There are three issues:
1) hotplug routines are called from within kernel. GregKH has stated on
   multiple occasions that doing this is wrong/bad/evil. This includes
   calling hot-unplug.
2) As a result, the code to call hot-unplug is a bit messy. In
   particular, there's a bit of hoop-jumping when hotplug is built as
   as a module (and said hoops were wrecked recently when I moved the
   code around, out of the rpaphp directory).
3) Hot-unplug causes scripts to run in user-space. There is no way to 
   know when these scripts are done, so its not clear if we've waited
   long enough before calling hot-add (or if waiting is even necessary).

Yes, and it seems to work fine despite the fact that the current 
sles9/rhel4 use rather oooooold versions of udev, which is criminal,
according to Kay Seivers.  I have not tested new versions of udev; 
I assume new versions will work "even better".

Why? To acheive what goal?  (Keep in mind that user-space eeh solutions
seem to fail when the affected device is storage, since block devices
and filesystems don't like the underlying storage to wink out.)

Ahh, yes, this addresses the timing issue raised in point 3).  However,
I'm thinking that the timing issue is not really an issue, depending on
how udev is designed.  For example, consider a 100% cpu loaded, heavy
i/o loaded PC, and now we rapidly unplug and replug some USB key.
Presumably, udev will handle this gracefully.  The kernel error recovery
essentially looks the same to udev: the burp on the bus looks like a
rapid-fire unplug-replug.
BTW, zSeries has similar concerns, where channels can come and go,
causing thousands of unplug/replug udev events in rapid succession. 
(This was discussed on the udev mailing lists in the past).  It might
be interesting to have the zSeries folks discuss the current EEH design,
as this is something they have far more experience with than any of 
the pc or unix crowd.  I personally have not discussed with any zSeries 
people.
