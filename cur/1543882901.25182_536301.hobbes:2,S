You'll put gcc out of a job ;)

hm, could do.  might_sleep() is intertwined with preempt in complex ways,
but we did decouple that at the config level.  no_mmap_sem() will dtrt for
all preempt settings.
But I'll be keeping this as a -mm-only debug patch (which brings us up to
about thirty of 'em), so I think it's best to make it unconfigurable so we
get maximum coverage.
That's if it actually works.  I haven't tried running it yet, and I have a
feeling that running it might cause a big "doh" moment.  We'll see.
