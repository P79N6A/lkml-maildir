To my way of thinking, it's a pretty good description of Ingo's work
or anything you're ever going to see on a PC. If you think you're
going to get real hard RT performance on your off-the-shelf x86 box
running a conventional OS, you are fooling yourself.
Thankfully a buffer underrun is no more fatal for pro audio than a
broken guitar string. CDs skip, DATs glitch, XLR cables flake out,
circuit breakers trip, amps clip, Powerbooks crash, and the show goes
on. I've done more than enough stage tech to know it's a huge pain in
the ass, but let's stop pretending we require absolute perfection,
please.
