... totalling about 193K if you include everything.  For comparison, 
static kinit by itself is 67K (which includes ipconfig, nfsroot, etc.) 
For an "include everything" variant, it would probably make more sense 
to port busybox, and/or add more tools as dash builtins.
All of these are uncompressed sizes.
