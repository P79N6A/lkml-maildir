Icc has been following psABI for years on Linux and it doesn't stop people
using icc on Linux.  On the other hand, it may be a good idea to provide a
workaround in gcc and enables it by default.  OSVs can fix thekernel and
disable it by default.
We can even issue a message whenever the workaround is used.
