Thats something completely different and usually caused by the gfx
card not being able to handle the bandwith needed for full video
display.  Result are aborted PCI transfers, which results in the video
being displayed fine on the left side and not being displayed
correctly on the right side of the window.
Usually can be workarounded by using 16 bpp instead of 32 which halves
the video data rate.
