Just to make sure it wasn't a gcc thing, I've recompiled the original
setup with egcs-1.1.2 (previously had used 2.95.2) and that did not
fix a thing.
Next backed out the entire XMM and FXSR related stuff and now everything
is fine again. The CPU in question is an AMD Thunderbird (see cpuinfo
below). A friend with a similar setup but a Pentium-3 CPU doesn't seem
to see the problem (couldn't verify myself).
/proc/cpuinfo:

Who wrote that new FXSR stuff? Maybe they have an idea of what's going on.
Regards,
Udo.
