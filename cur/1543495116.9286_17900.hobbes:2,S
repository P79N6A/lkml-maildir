  Hi,
  I'm experiencing _bad_ trouble with TCP/PPP latency lately.
  About half of my calls to demon.nl gives normal PPP latency
  and performance (100 to 200 ms latency), but sometimes I get
  a network latency of 20 to 30(!) seconds on the PPP link.
  I'm using kernel 2.2.7 with the following PPP command line:
  /usr/sbin/pppd lock modem /dev/modem 115200 idle 90 demand \
      defaultroute mru 296 mtu 296 bsdcomp 15,15 $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP\
      novj netmask $NETMASK connect $DIALER_SCRIPT
  Before switching off Von Jacobson compression the network
  latency was usually worse, but now it's all right about
  50% of the time...
  Running 'mtr' for some time (or ping) usually brings back
  the latency to about half of what it was before, but it
  still sucks eggs :(
  Anybody got an idea what to do?
  thanks,
I use dial-up aswell, and havn't noticed any problems.
Your mtu/mru settings are extremely low (tcp/ip overhead is a minum
of 40bytes iirc), maybe there's some new hardware at demon that
chokes on it.
try it at 1024 and see, and set a window size aswell, eg about 2,3
times your mtu.
-Paul.
