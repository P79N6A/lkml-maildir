Hi,
I haven't been able to reproduce complete hangs, but with your proggy
adapted to my quad, _and_ the addition of a SCHED_NORMAL hog, I can
reproduce some very bad interactivity, including massive character
repeats while attempting to type, and general "lurchiness" (_bad_ wakeup
latency).  I'll poke it with a sharp stick or two.
