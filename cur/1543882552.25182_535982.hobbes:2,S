good luck.  this issue comes up on a regular basis on mailing lists
all over the place and the response is always the same -- some
companies, based on the advice of their legal departments, absolutely
*require* those rambling, worthless disclaimers, and the senders have
no ability whatsoever to turn them off.
there is only one solution to that sort of thing -- blacklist the
entire sending domain until they get a clue.  yes, it's draconian, but
there's really no other way to educate them.
