hmm, actually we do the lookup in each dqget, which from
dquot_initialize (open), dquot_transfer (chown,chgrp), 
and vfs_get_dqblk/vfs_set_dqblk (quota ctls) ...
but I agree that we do not care too much about performance ...

exactly, this is one of the future quota enhancements, 
I have in mind ... not exactly directory based, but more
vfsmount based ... (which includes the superblock case)

as I wrote "first step", "future quota enhancements" ...
this hopefully will be in the next step, or the step after ...

at the moment, I do not care if this is for 2.4, 2.6 
or 2.8 or for my personal tree ;) I just want to test 
some of my ideas regarding quota improvements/extensions, 
and the current design isn't flexible enough to allow it ...

I guess this is right, but I assume the kernel lock 
will do nicely (any objections? if not I'll add that)
thanks for looking at it ... ;)
best,
