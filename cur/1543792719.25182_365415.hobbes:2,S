I think that the full suite of "pathname lookups relative to a fd"
functions was implied.
Note that you could always introduce pthread_attr_setsharedfs(3) and
pthread_attr_getsharedfs(3) (or whatever you want to call them) which
control the passing of CLONE_FS to clone(2) in pthread_create(). This
would allow you to create threads which have their own pwd and umask
(and even chroot, but I don't think that would be very useful) without
any kernel changes.
