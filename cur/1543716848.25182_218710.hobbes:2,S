I'm one of the people for whom Patrick's suspend worked and yours didn't.  Now 
I've been busy with other things for a couple months (Penguicon 2.0 went 
quite well, by the way), and there's talk of yanking Patrick's suspend code 
from the kernel.  Right, so I've got to deal with this.  I can't say I'm 
thrilled, but I DO want to continue to be able to suspend my laptop.
What kind of debug info do I need to report to get your suspend code fixed, 
and who do I need to report it to?
I just tested 2.6.5, which went "boing" trying to suspend with some kind of 
debug message that gave me a hex number (not a panic, but I didn't have a pen 
handy, I can try again and write it down if you like.  Anything else I should 
do?)
I asked Nigel a few months ago, and he pointed me to an enormous flag day 
patch that will probably be integrated into the kernel when hell freezes 
over.  (I have no idea why it's so intrusive, by the way.  Isn't half the 
point of sysfs and the new 2.6 device infrastructure that finding all the 
devices that need to be shut up doesn't require the kind of insanity doing it 
under 2.4 did?
I read the docs and read through your code a bit, and every screenful or so it 
says "this code is guaranteed to eat your data if you look at it funny".  
I've been using Patrick's suspend code for something like eight months now, 
and it never ate any of my data.  Failed to resume a few times, but no worse 
than sync followed by yanking the power cord, fsck did its thing and life 
went on.  (Yes, I back up regularly.  But I've gotten the distinct impression 
that you have no faith whatsoever in your own work, and reinstalling and 
restoring from backups is a real pain, especially when you're on the road.)
Sigh.  I _really_ don't have time for this right now.  I wonder if it would be 
possible to just send Patrick some money?
