OK, partially. As this case illustrates, everybody makes mistakes and
you obviously can't go back and verify you got all the patches because.
The guy who hits the bug and/or writes the patch can easily see it is
still not merged and shout.

You do a great job, but "push the work out to the end nodes", right?
That's how we get this network to scale. It is trivial for people to
verify their important patches have propogated as the release approaches.
(A little harder for part-timers who aren't in the loop about exactly
when the release will happen, thanks to our -ridiculous-count release
system, but still easy compared with your having to double check
everything).
