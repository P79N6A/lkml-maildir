The distortion is noise in the music. The music does not stutter or stop. 
It's a high-toned noise in the music. It's not there every second, but on 
average 30 seconds in every minute. It seems to be dependand on the kind of 
calcultions seti is making.
The noise seems to have nothing to do with X11, because in console mode 
running the seti client and mpg123, results in exactly the same noiselevel as 
in X11.
I've tried 2.4.3-pre{3,4,6}, 2.4.3, 2.4.4-pre5 and 2.4.3-ac11, they al have 
the problem. Only 2.4.3-pre{1,2} did not. 2.4.2 has also no problems.
