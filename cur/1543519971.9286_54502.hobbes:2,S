Linus:
I'm looking to get the LKCD project code into 2.X (X >= 3).  This of
course may require a number of changes, feature additions, etc., on our
end, as well as the code modifications from people like Stephen Tweedie,
in order to accomodate going into the release.
Any thoughts?  If you have philosophical issues which would preclude it
from making it into the future releases, please let us know what they
are, so we may best address them.  The immediate issue isn't which release
to put it in, but whether it will eventually be considered a candidate
for inclusion.
Project information, code, etc., can be found at:
	
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/lkcd/
The latest version is 1.0.3, and a version for 2.3.X (excluding kernel
kiobuf modifications we're still waiting on) is available.
Thoughts and opinions appreciated.
