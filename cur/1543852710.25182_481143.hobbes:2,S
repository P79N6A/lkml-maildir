No, of course we should not change existing kernel interfaces.

Yes, it is an option to document units in seperate files. But I personally
think,
that this is only the second best solution. Especially since normally
documentation is not read.

Why not trying to make things better than they used to be?
At least for our s390_hypfs I would like to use the suggested naming

conventions. Ok?
So, no "Documentation/filesystems/ExportData" patch?
