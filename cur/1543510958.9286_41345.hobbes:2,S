Hi!
The only thing that keeps me running a 2.0 kernel at the moment is a
joystick driver that allows me to connect two Commodore 64-style joysticks
to an adapter on a parallel port. This driver, "joystick-0.8.0.2.tar.gz",
won't compile under a 2.2 kernel.
I've seen that 2.2 does have partial support for this adapter, but, only one
joystick, and the "0.8.0.2" has support for two.
I was wondering if anyone here know of a patch that will support both
joysticks, or if the stand-alone joystick driver has been updated to work
with 2.2? I would like to upgrade to 2.2...
