	The ability to remove a module is generally independent of
whether or not there is any hardware present at that moment for which
the module supplies a driver.  Instead, the determining issue is
whether there are file descriptors open for that driver.
	Of course, if the necessary hardware was never present at any
time when the device driver's module was loaded, then there never will
be any file descriptors open for the device driver.
