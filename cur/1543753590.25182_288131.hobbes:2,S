Yes, that's how it was done before.  The patch I just posted was intended
to fix the apparent typo without getting any deeper.  Below is an untested
alternate patch to restore the old behavior under the new macro regime.

I wasn't really on a cputime-cleanup rampage, just fixing the obvious bugs
I saw.  I hope Martin would like to do some cleanup.
Thanks,
Roland
