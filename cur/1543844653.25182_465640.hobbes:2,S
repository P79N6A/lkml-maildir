That's right.  But OTOH device drivers shouldn't be using the page 
allocator to get DMAable memory, they should be using one of the DMA APIs 
since only they can portably map memory for DMA.

Right, the internals are arch specific and don't necessarily have to rely 
on a zone, depending on their DMA constraints.
