When I last contacted them, couple of months ago, through
I-dunno-how-many-middle[wo]men they assured that
"driver is in developement" and "soon we make a release"...

I have ported the 1.14 version of the driver to 2.2.18.
Basically converted their idea of patching with cp to
normal diff and dropped all reverse changes.

It was for pre22 but applies cleanly to final 2.2.18.
The other soft was most current in valinux site:

No, the DPT driver has not been updated to native Linux i2o.
Note: the driver compiles only with gcc 2.7.2.3, (dunno about
egcs).  2.95.2 makes it acting weird.  I do not know if
thats gcc or driver problem.
