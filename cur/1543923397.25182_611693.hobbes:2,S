I see a lot of case where you add preempt_disable/enable around areas
that have the PTE lock held...
So in -rt, spin_lock doesn't disable preempt ? I'm a bit worried...
there are some strong requirements that anything within that lock is not
preempted, so zap_pte_ranges() is the obvious ones but all of them would
need to be addressed.
