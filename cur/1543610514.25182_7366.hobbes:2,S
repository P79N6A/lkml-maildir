Hm, that is what I get for trying to get a release out while away for
Thanksgiving ...
try changing:
	if (task_on_runqueue(prev) && !prev->has_cpu)
to:
	if (task_on_runqueue(prev) && !task_has_cpu(prev))
in kernel/sched.c on line 509.
I'll put a new revision of the patch out when I get a chance ...
