Crap, sorry about that.  I've deleted my tree and will rebuild it.  I
thought that it was one of the usb patches in my tree that was causing
you problems.  I'll not include this one until we get to the bottom of
it (and with David gone, that might take a while.)
Again, very sorry about this.
Oh, and I'll also drop the one from Randy with the gfp flags, and
properly attribute Russell's patch.
thanks,
