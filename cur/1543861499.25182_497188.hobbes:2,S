fixed, I think the patch is in -rc4 already (it is listed in the "Merge 
/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6" on Jan. 4th in the git browser)

no patch available yet, remote DoS attack for 2.6.20-rc3, not excluded 
this has been the case since nf_conntrack_ipv6 was available (2.6.16 or 
so), UDPv6 fragments are rare in the wild and a large number of users 
could not use nf_conntrack_ipv6 up to now due to incompatibility with 
IPv4 NAT code.

Bernhard
