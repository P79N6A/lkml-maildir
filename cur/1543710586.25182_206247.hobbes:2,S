That would be the rare case where it's not necessary. =)

That's not quite where the issue happens. Suppose you have a COW
sharing group (called variously struct anonmm, struct anon, and so on
by various codebases) where a page you're trying to unmap occurs at
some virtual address in several of them, but others may have hugetlb
vmas where that page is otherwise expected. On i386 and potentially
others, the core may not understand present pmd's that are not mere
pointers to ptes and other machine-dependent hugetlb constructs, so
there is trouble. Searching the COW sharing group isn't how everything
works, but in those cases where additionally you can find mm's that
don't map the page at that virtual address and may have different vmas
cover it, this can arise.
