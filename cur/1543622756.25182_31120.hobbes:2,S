You aren't crazy.  Lots of us with T2[012]'s have this problem.  It does 
indeed appear to be a problem with the OSS version of the driver. 
Someone had a theory that the APM code stays in an interrupt too long 
and causes the card to get into an unanticipated state, causing the poor 
sound quality.
The weird part is that some of us see the problem often, while some 
never see it at all.  I haven't had it happen in months, so I suspect 
that later versions of the kernel are better equipped to handle it.  At 
least the ALSA one seems to work better.
