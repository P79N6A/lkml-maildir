I sent mail to David Hinds about the problem, and he seemed to think that
.10 would have fixed it...  I haven't tested since I upgraded to .12, but
does indeed sound like the problem is still there.  Suck.  Good thing I'm
not working with my PC cards too much right now ;-)
This problem does need to get solved ASAP, as it makes normal operation of
a laptop under Linux rather a pain.  Having to ifdown and remove a card
before suspending every time is not fun.
