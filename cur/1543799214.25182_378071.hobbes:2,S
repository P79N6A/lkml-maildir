sure, but adding this sure wont reduce complexity ;)

in any case, on sane platforms (i386, x86_64) an irq-disable is 
well-optimized in hardware, and is just as fast as a preempt_disable().
Combined with the fact that CLI/STI has no register side-effects, it can 
even be faster/cheaper, on x86 at least.
