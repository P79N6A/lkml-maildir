In order to efficiently implement tar, it is necessary to store the
inode numbers for files with a link count greater than 1 in a hash
table.  It would not be practical to keep open all of these files in
order to ensure that the inode numbers remain valid.  Thus, a different
unique identifier is needed, which is unique even for files that are not
open.
