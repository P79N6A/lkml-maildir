Umm... I just checked that specific RPM, and that RPM *does* contain all that
you need. In particular, the following *are* in there:
kernel-2.6.spec
linux-2.6.11.tar.bz2
patch-2.6.12-rc5-neutered.bz2  <- probably why they won't patch a 2.6.11
The spec file lists all the *.patch files and the order to apply them in.  It
even has a whole bunch of *.config files.
Your best best is to 'rpm -ivh' that RPM - that will put the pieces in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES and /usr/src/redhat/SPECS.  'rpmbuild kernel.spec'
(with appropriate flags, you probably want '--target x86_64' if you want
a  64-bit build only).  Adding patches is a matter of dropping the patch in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES and adding a few lines to the kernel-2.6.spec file.
