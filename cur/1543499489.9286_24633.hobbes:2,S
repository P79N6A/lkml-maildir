I don't think you can call it a hack. There are two ways of handling
dynamic devices
1.	The kernel gives userspace info and userspace builds a /dev.
2.	The kernel builds a /dev
#2 is devfs
#1 is devfs with a script walking it.
You can actually rip out chunks of devfs for #2 but the hooks you need to build
the information database happen to be exactly the ones you need for a full
devfs
