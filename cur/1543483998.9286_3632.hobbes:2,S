Amazing, I have been struggling with the fact that my ricochet
wireless modem wouldn't work with the 2.1 kernels for months. I never
could figure out why I could get UDP through but not TCP. 
Can anyone explain why van jacombson compression doesn't work? Is it a 
problem with pppd, the 2.2 kernel or the the other side? (the ricochet 
and I guess the van jacobson compression by extension work with
2.0.36)
