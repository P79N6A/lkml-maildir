Okay, let's try to start from the beginning...
initramfs is, indeed, a replacement for initrd, but it's not a 1:1 map. 
  Instead, initramfs contents -- which can come from multiple sources! 
-- is simply extracted right into rootfs.
kinit is a replacement for the in-kernel root-handling code, as well as 
other related in-kernel code like resume from disk.  It is compiled as a 
monolithic binary for size reasons.
klibc is a very small C library which *can* be used to produce initramfs 
binaries; in particular, it's used to produce kinit, and is small enough 
that it can be realistically included with the kernel distribution.
If you provide your own /init in an initramfs, it will override the 
default, which is /init -> /kinit.  You can then choose to invoke kinit 
if you want to; for example, you could try to resume from suspend2, and 
invoke kinit if that fails.
