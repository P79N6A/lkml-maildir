How can subsystems control multithreaded vs. singlethreaded probes?
For example, the IEEE 1394 subsystem should probe different nodes in
parallel, but different units on the same node serially.  Similar
requirements exist with other hardware.
Also, how can subsystems enable and disable multithreaded probes?

Their definitions lack kerneldoc comments.
