People who develop kernel code know the difference between
'==' and '=' and are never confused my them. If you make
contributions to kernel code, and write: "if (0==foo)", your
code will be reviewed until it is obsolete and never find
its way into the kernel. Please don't insult kernel developers
with this kind of kid-stuff.
People who develop kernel code also know what a line-warp is.
They put a '\n' "[Enter] key" in their text every so-often,
maybe every 70 to 79 characters...
Cheers,
