Well, the problem is that bridge 1 in this chain is completely unconfigured
(it seems to be in after-reset state), while bridge 2 (PCIE-to-PCI one)
does have reasonable setup. This leads to "successful" resource allocations
on the bus 3, even though these resources are not accessible due to
incorrect setup of the bridge 1.
On the other hand, pci_assign_unassigned_resources() doesn't touch
already allocated resources, probably leaving them outside of bridge windows.
I think the correct behaviour of pcibios_allocate_bus_resources()
(arch/i386/pci/i386.c) should be as follows:
if some bridge resource cannot be allocated for whatever reason,
don't allow any child resource assignments in that range. Just
clear the resource flags - this prevents building an inconsistent
resource tree.
pci_assign_unassigned_resources() should correctly configure bridge 1
and all subordinate stuff then.
Ivan.
