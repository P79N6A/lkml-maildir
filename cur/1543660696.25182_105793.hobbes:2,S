    Hi Sundara :)
> 	 INIT: Id "x" respawing too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
    This has nothing to do with the kernel. Read the manual for your
sysvinit. There is the explanation of the problem and the posible
solutions.
    FYI, your problem is a process spawned by your 'init' (check
/etc/inittab) dieing as soon as it is created. In order to avoid this
exec-die cycle, the respawning is stopped during 5 minutes. Read the
manual, anyway ;))
