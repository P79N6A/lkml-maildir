So, with the cpu_is_offline check in rebalance_tick on top of
2.6.8-rc2-mm2, this is the BUG_ON in migration_call I tend to hit while
hotplugging cpus as quickly as possible while running make -j 40:
        case CPU_DEAD:
                migrate_all_tasks(cpu);
                rq = cpu_rq(cpu);
                kthread_stop(rq->migration_thread);
                rq->migration_thread = NULL;
                /* Idle task back to normal (off runqueue, low prio) */
                rq = task_rq_lock(rq->idle, &flags);
                deactivate_task(rq->idle, rq);
                rq->idle->static_prio = MAX_PRIO;
                __setscheduler(rq->idle, SCHED_NORMAL, 0);
                task_rq_unlock(rq, &flags);
                BUG_ON(rq->nr_running != 0);
I can reproduce this on both ppc64 and i386.  Does anyone know why this
is happening?
If I remove the BUG_ON, things seem to go ok, but I doubt that's the
right thing to do.
