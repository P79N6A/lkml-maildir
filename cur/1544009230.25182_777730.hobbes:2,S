I've just built a kernel with your three patches, and without the earlier
"revert/debug" and "ignore transparent bridge" patches.
It also includes my patch that somewhat improves USB resume and my fix for 
the ohci1394: "irq 19: nobody cared" issue. (Although I understand that 
it's likely we'll get a much more structural improvement for USB than my 
naive patch.)
I'll run my notebook with this kernel for the next few days and let you 
know the results. First suspend/resume cycle was fine and showed, as 
expected, a lot of config restores moved up, including HDA intel and 
pcieport-driver.
It's nice to see something of significance happening before the ricoh-mmc 
controller gets disabled :-P
Cheers,
