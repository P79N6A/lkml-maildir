I took a look at the wanrouter code, very clean!
I've basically just coppied it for the VLAN proc files.
The next thing on my list is to write some code that can set up
peer-to-peer
switching among devices.  In other words, each device will be able to
specify
one other device that it is to send all it's incomming packets to.
What this will give me is the ability to directly map DLCI or SVC/PVC
'devices' to
VLAN 'devices', thereby giving me basically a layer-2 switch.  So, to
set this up in the kernel, I want to have the ability to specify that
device foo shall send all incomming buffers to device bar.
My original idea was to have a proc file that I could write something
like this:   vlan0 <-> dlci5\n ...  to a special /proc file.
Is the above idea a standard way to do something like this, or should I
just shoot
for IOCTL's?  Can anyone point me to some code that actually handles
writes
to a /proc file?
Thanks,
Ben
