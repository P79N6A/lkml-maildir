I don't know what is "ll/sc" but I agree that at least on architectures
that has a proper "mb" assembler instruction the mb() approch seems to be
right choice to me.
When we'll reach an agreement I'll be happy to redo the patch with a
different approch. ;) (after all the conversion will be only a trivial
task)
My proposal could be something like:
	set_current_state(INTERRUPTIBLE);
and #define a secondary:
	__set_current_state(INTERRUPTIBLE);
that it will never used by me, but it can be used to implement future code
that doesn't need an explicit SMP memory barrier.
Hints are welcome. ;)
Thanks.
Andrea
