My comment was in regard to the subthread concerning the backport of
CML2 to 2.4 only. Not 2.5/2.6. Yes, tools need to be upgraded
OVER MAJOR VERSIONS. I was not debating that.

Anyone maintaining Config.in files. What you're proposing doubles the
amount of work to keep them up to date. Especially for out-of-tree code.

Absolutely.

And did any of these require updated tools to build the kernel ?
No. I could take a kernel with these features, and build it on
a 6 month old distro.

Crap. It's about not screwing over an installed userbase for a
feature that is nothing more than a "Nice to have" add-on for 2.4.
It's taken us long enough to get 2.4 where it is, hopefully the
days of things getting shovelled in enmasse are over.

I recommend "Kill by thread". Works wonders.
