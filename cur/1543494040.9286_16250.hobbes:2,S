You may not want to use the previous patch, since it makes a few incorrect
assumptions about how throttling is handled from the higher tty layer.
I later corrected that, but then it turnes out that the original problem i
had (probing not working) cannot be reproduced anymore, even after
rebooting!
If anyone else has had strange things happen with 16750s let me know.. ;)
