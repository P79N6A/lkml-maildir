Subject: [PATCH] Avoid console spam with ext3 aborted journal.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Avoid console spam with ext3 aborted journal.
ext3 usually reports error conditions that it detects in its environment.
But when its journal gets aborted due to such errors, it can sometimes 
continue to report that condition forever, spamming the console to such 
an extent that the initial first cause of the journal abort can be lost.
When the journal aborts, we put the filesystem into readonly mode.  Most
subsequent filesystem operations will get rejected immediately by checks
for MS_RDONLY either in the filesystem or in the VFS.  But some paths do
not have such checks --- for example, if we continue to write to a file
handle that was opened before the fs went readonly.  (We only check for
the ROFS condition when the file is first opened.)  In these cases, we 
can continue to generate log errors similar to
EXT3-fs error (device $DEV) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
for each subsequent write.
There is really no point in generating these errors after the initial
error has been fully reported.  Specifically, if we're starting a 
completely new filesystem operation, and the filesystem is *already*
readonly (ie. the ext3 layer has already detected and handled the 
underlying jbd abort), and we see an EROFS error, then there is simply
no point in reporting it again.
