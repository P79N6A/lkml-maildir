(I used the xfs_grow 2 times)
The hw:
I use 4 nodes, each has 3.3TiB (RAID4 array), and serves NBD.
On the concentrator the RAID0 makes one 12.9TiB from 4x3.3TiB nbd device.
The strip is 4kb. (tested, and optimal for performance)

Yes, you have right!
I know, this is a big chance to corrupt the fs, but i need strongly the
write caching!
This quota corruption is from that case too....

:-) Yes, i know.
But on my case, the service is much more important than the data inside the
fs.
I run a huge "free web storage", and i hate that thing, when i get up, and
can see, the system stops on the automatic reboot, and down for few hours...

If it can reboot normally, and drop some MB or GB, this is a "little lose"
for me.

Anyway, if i remove the he -L, the boot hangs on mount about 8 from10 times.
The ~1GB lose of 4K strip can pretty much damage the journal too.....
If it can repair the fs (2 times from 10), it is often uncompleted, and some
minutes or hours lated i get the XFS_FORCE_SHUTDOWN message thanks to the
corruption....
(I planned to use an external log, but at this time i dont trust too much
the journal recovery....
And if the concentrator finish the flush, the journal notes that it is
completed, but the node can hang during write, and drop the data anyway.)

Sorry, but i cant.
Additionally, i allready have shut down the quota, and i cannot reproduce
the "bad quota related hang" problem.
Thanks a lot!
