	 Hi Alan (and the others)
	A few notes related to you *-ac* patches, the IrDA stack and
the Wavelan driver.
First, IrDA :

	The above patch is unnecessary. The definition of
irlap_queue_xmit() has been added in irlap_frame.h as part of
2.4.2 (I've just checked). So, you can drop this snipset.
	By the way, I'm updating the IrDA patches in the pipeline (USB
driver and co) and will send that to Dag soon.

	This one is good. As you have it, we won't resend it to Linus.
	By the way, thanks to whoever spent time to correct my
spelling mistakes...

	I confirm again that I'm totally opposed to this patch of the
wavelan driver you have in your tree (see below).
	Replacing a perfectly valid inline function with a ugly define
it totally backward. If you look closely, the initial code was correct
and clean. I don't know anyone with taste who could advocate such a
patch without remorse.
	As we discussed earlier, this patch is only necessary because
gcc 2.96 miscompile the complex definition of udelay(). If gcc 2.96
miscompile the kernel, people should fix it or use a compiler that
works properly, not uglify my driver ;-)
	On the other hand, thanks infinitely to Jeff for having
updated the wavelan_cs driver (I'm still using Pcmcia outside the
kernel).

	That's it, have a good week end...
