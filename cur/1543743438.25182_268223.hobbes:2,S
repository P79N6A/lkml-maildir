The problem was class_simple only contains the "dev" attribute. You can't
add other attributes to it.
The correct thing should be to create "class_tty" with all necessary attributes 
(speed, data transferred, etc).  
But thats not a v2.6 thing I believe.  
I talked to Greg about this at the time and he agreed we need a "class_tty"
type.
