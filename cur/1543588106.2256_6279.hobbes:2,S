I concur. This is easy, and clean.

I can see at least two types of events - (forgive the lack of colorful
terminology) passive and active. Passive events are simply providing
status updates, much like the events described above. These are simply so
some UI can notify the user of things like a low battery or detection of
an AC adapter. These can be handled in much the same way as described
above.
Active events require some sort of action by user space, like a shutdown
request initiated by a button press or a dead battery. See the next
comment.

First, Is there any reason why the kernel should do more text processing?
It is better left for user space. Besides, enumerated values translated by
userspace seems more efficient than copying and parsing strings.
Having a daemon that sits in user space and waits for system events
(denoted by enumerated values in some /proc or /dev file) seems simple
enough. When it gets the request to power down, it handles calling init
and whatever else it wants to do. When it gets notification that the
laptop was plugged into the base station, it can look for new devices and
load the modules for them.
This can also handle the user-dictated policy, which I haven't seen
discussed yet. For instance, when you close the lid or press the power
button, the system can enter suspend or it can power off. If the kernel
simply exported the event, the userspace daemon could simply check its
config file for the proper thing to do and initiate the transition.

Sure, but does it really make sense for anything but system sleep states? 
ACPI defines a mechnanism for runtime power management, where devices will
go into sleep states if they're not being used. Given proper heuristics
for controlling this, user-initiated suspension of individual devices
doesn't seem necessary. And, given a proper abstraction in the PM layer,
this should be extendable, to some extent, to other low-level PM schemes.
