It works for me. Describe your problem more coherently.
I wouldn't describe it as 'very old' -- the last commit seems to have
been last March, which isn't _so_ recent but perhaps it just hasn't
_needed_ an update?
Neither would I describe it as unmaintained. Tony was quite quickly
responsive when I asked him if it would be OK to include unifdef in the
kernel source tree.

I don't see a huge point in changing, unless it lets us get rid of stuff
like 
	#if defined(__KERNEL__ && ....
when used with -U__KERNEL__.
