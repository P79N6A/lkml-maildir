I had some bad experiences with following processes you suggest the 
doesn't remove the symbol immediately:
As you wanted me to do, I scheduled the EXPORT_SYMBOL(insert_resource) 
for removal on 2 May 2005 with both __deprecated_for_modules and an 
entry in feature-removal-schedule.txt with the target date April 2006.
On 11 Apr 2006, I sent the patch to implement this scheduled removal.
As of today, the latter patch is still stuck in -mm (which isn't better 
than having it dropped) although it's long overdue.
Do you understand why I distrust your "to aid later decision-making"?
Can you state publically "If there's still no in-kernel user after six 
months, the removal is automatically ACK'ed."?
