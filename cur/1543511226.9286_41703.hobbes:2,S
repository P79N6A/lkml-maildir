Hi again,
I wrote in a couple days ago complaining of hard lockups. The only clue
I'm getting via syslog, which I assume is a symptom of the problem (but
I may be wrong) are the following messages which have been occurring
lately in /var/log/messages:
Sep 30 18:49:33 cb26038-a kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Sep 30 18:49:33 cb26038-a kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
I put in a new IDE cable, and while the machine hasn't hung since then,
the error continues to appear once or twice a day in my syslog. I was
warned against disabling DMA auto detection, which was a proposed
solution (to another problem I guess). I am wondering how I should
interpret this; if it's just my HD going bad, I can deal with that and
buy a new one... but I'm not sure it's a bad HD and don't want to waste
$$ on something I don't need.
I'm sure this is a recent thing, I have not been getting these errors
until the last few weeks. My problems have occurred with both the 2.2.10
and 2.2.12 kernels, but I suspect they are not to blame.
When the machine hangs, it freezes solid; not responsive to anything
but the reset/power switch (this makes me think hardware). And the
dma errors do not occur right before the crash, but the occurrance of
the error message showing up in my syslog and hard freezes seem to
coincide. BTW /dev/hda has my boot sector for both Linux and NT and is
approximately 2 years old. It's always mounted IOW.
What I'd love is a way to tell whether the drive is bad without moving it
to another machine. I'm not so sure that's possible. I just don't know
how to interpret the error messages and what they really mean (it ain't
a bad cable).
Here's some info I hope will help if there is any troubleshooting to be
done:
The machine is a 233 MMX Intel Pentium, with a ASUS TX 97-X mobo/chipset
with Award BIOS software. Both the BIOS and Linux kernel are ready for
UDMA autodetection. /dev/hda is a master to an identical hard drive. My
other IDE slot has a cd rom and a cd-rw drive (I know, I should have
the masters be the HDs and the slaves be the CDs but that shouldn't have
any bearing on this right?). Software-wise, it's RedHat 6.0 with some
updates.
When the machine finds the hard drives:
