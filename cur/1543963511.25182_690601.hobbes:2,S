Ok, I'll go rename them to be ".current" instead of ".next"

No, 2.6.27, it will get sent to Jeff probably next week when I get the
last round of proposed patches into it.  But people are using it today,
so it is good for their testing and to work off of.
Same thing goes for the via framebuffer driver that I'll move into
ldp.next next week when the last round of cleanups to it happen.  It too
is for 2.6.27.

No, the "ldp.next" tree is one kernel release away, I think I put it in
the correct place in the sequence because of this.
If you want me to move it, I'd be glad to do so.
