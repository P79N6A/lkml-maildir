You got it.  db4+O_DIRECT == blah.  (I just had a conversation yesterday 
with rpm's maintainer about what the problems are)
One problem is O_DIRECT should return an error on open(2) or fcntl(2), 
not write(2).
Another problem appears to be that db does not know about the alignment 
requirements of O_DIRECT.

Unfortunately, LD_ASSUME_KERNEL is a lucky hack, not a fix.  rpm dlopens 
a pam .so.  LD_ASSUME_KERNEL doesn't work for that .so, only for rpm 
itself...  fun ensues.
