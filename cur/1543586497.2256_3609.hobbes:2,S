It is bogus that this stuff depends on link order to function
correctly.  The driver is built and linked into the kernel in its
current fashion to satisfy Linus' desire to make drivers as independant
from the SCSI Makefile and Config file as possible.  I've modified
how the driver is built for the 6.1.9 driver release so it will be
linked in prior to the top level drivers.
