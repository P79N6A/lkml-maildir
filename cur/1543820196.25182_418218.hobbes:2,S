ok. Let me explain what I mean.
Imagine the situation with global memory shortage. In kernel, there are 
threads which do some job behalf the user, e.g. kjournald, loop etc. If 
the user has some pzone memory, but these threads fail to do their job 
some nasty things can happen (ext3 problems, deadlocks, OOM etc.)
If such behaviour is ok for you, then great. But did you consider it?
Also, I can't understand how it works with OOM killer. If pzones has 
enough memory, but there is a global shortage, who will be killed?
Thanks,
Kirill
