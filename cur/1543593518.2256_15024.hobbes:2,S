No. Sorry. Create nice tool to display info for you. We are talking
about output from kernel. It *must not* be configurable. Or do you
want your programs to read 58 from /proc/acpi/thermal/1/status and
then reading /proc/units to see if it is celsius or farenhait.
ACPI is already using 0.1*K, so everything should use that to be
consistent.
