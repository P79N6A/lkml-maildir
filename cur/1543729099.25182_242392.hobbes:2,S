I'm back.
The round mode for the emulator is compiled in. Changing the round mode 
caused failures in some of the other LSB float tests.  I had intended to 
say something about this before taking off on vacation. Sorry.
The way I got the LSB tests to pass was to remove the round in the 
denormalised underflow case. This appears to match the hardware 
behavior. I've not looked at the PPC floating point model close enough 
to know if this is proper behavior. It is what the LSB tests are 
expecting and doesn't cause a failure in any of the other LSB tests.
