i found a bug in linux-2.4.35.
the bug produces a crashing kernel when compiled
with gcc >=4.2.0 and VIA C3 optimized -march=c3
(CONFIG_MCYRIXIII=y)
this issue was first discussed on the gcc bugzilla:
 
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32264
and tracked down to the include/asm-i386/hw_irq.h
module with the help of the gcc guys:

these macros a far beyond my capabilities to fix.
