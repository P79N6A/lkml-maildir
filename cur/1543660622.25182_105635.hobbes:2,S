If it works correctly then the variability in lat_ctx should go away.
Try this
	for p in 2 4 8 12 16 24 32 64
	do	for size in 0 2 4 8 16
		do	for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
			do	lat_ctx -s$size $p
			done
		done
	done
on both the with and without kernel.  The page coloring should make the 
numbers rock steady, without it, they will bounce a lot.
