Do you have an example of specific hardware that exhibits this problem? 
So far after a similar patch has been in -mm for months there have been 
no reports of any such problems.

This isn't guaranteed to help. I don't think it is only integrated 
graphics that could cause this problem, I think that an add-on PCI 
Express card can do this as well. Depending on the chipset memory decode 
rules, any PCI or PCI Express device with a BAR large enough could cause 
issues.
