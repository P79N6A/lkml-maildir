I couldn't find the previous discussion on netdev_fatal, so sorry if
this has already been worked out.  It uses KERN_ERR; did you mean
something stronger?  If not, why not just use netdev_err(dev, ALL,
"...")?  What is the situation in the driver where we'd want to use
_fatal?  How do I know when to use _fatal and when to use _err?
