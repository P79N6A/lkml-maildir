I think there is not value in "security though obscurity" when you're
developing an open source application.  :)
Like you said, CBC is not trivial to temper with - though it is do able.  CTR
is trivial on the other hand.  Which is why NIST and every cryptographer will
recommend using a MAC with CTR.  (Why still have CTR?  Unlike CBC, you can
compute the N+1-th block without needing to know the output from the N-th
block, so there is the possibility for very high parallelizum).
