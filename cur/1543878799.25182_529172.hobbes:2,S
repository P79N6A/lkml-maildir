Linux is not unstable. It's developmental! Linux is like one giant 
international research project marching toward the future of computing. 
MacOS (oh, how I miss System 7.5.5), Windows (shoot me, please), BSD 
(wannabe GNU/Linux), and everything else are there just for companies to 
spend money on and idiots to drool over until Linux is ready to stand up 
and say "Yo. It's just bugfixes and improvements from here. You can put 
the Legos down now."
