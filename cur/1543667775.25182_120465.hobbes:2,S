I'm on a RH phoebe beta box. I think this is due to my rc.sysinit not
being ready for 2.5 because I have built my nic driver as a module and
it loaded fine. I am not able to load USB modules or ntfs and vfat
modules. This is what I get at startup:
Setting hostname tiger:                              [  OK  ]
Initializing USB controller (usb-uhci): FATAL: Module usb_uhci
 not found.                                          [ FAILED ]
Mounting USB filesystem:                             [  OK  ]
grep: /proc/bus/usb/drivers:  No such file or directory.
Initializing USB HID interface:                      [  OK  ]
Initializing USB Keyboard: FATAL: Module keybdev not found.
                                                     [ FAILED ]
Initializing USB Mouse: FATAL: Module mousedev not found.
                                                     [ FAILED ]
[ some more stuff thats ok ]
Mounting local filesystems:  mount: fs type ntfs not supported by
kernel.  mount: fs type vfat not supported by kernel.
                                                     [ FAILED ]
I have built all required modules:
ls /lib/modules/2.4.66/kernel/drivers/usb/host
uhci-hcd.ko
ls /lib/modules/2.4.66/kernel/fs/fat
fat.ko
ls /lib/modules/2.4.66/kernel/fs/ntfs
ntfs.ko
