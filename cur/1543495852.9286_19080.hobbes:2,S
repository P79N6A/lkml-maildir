No, what it indicates is that you don't know how FreeBSD is developed.
The absolute latest development FreeBSD is available via CVS.  Nearly
everthing connected with FreeBSD development has a mailing list you can join.
Anyone can submit changes, which have to be committed by one of
approximately 150 people who have commit access to the CVS tree.
