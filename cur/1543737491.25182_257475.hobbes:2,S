Perhaps the majority of people with "old distro" configurations are people
who followed the development kernels from machines which were nearly
current then. My primary test machine is (loosely) based on RH7.3, with
only the updates needed for 2.6 as it developed and of course any security
issuesI saw.
The lack of reported issues may be caused by people who survived the
development process being able to identify the majority of problems like
this as well as there not being a lot of old systems.
