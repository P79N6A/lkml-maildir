Well, we talked about that some time ago, didn't we?
The rule is this: if one uses kernel 2.6.x from kernel.org _successfully_
with certain distribution (whatever it is), then one is supposed to be able to
take the kernel 2.6.(x+1), install it on that distribution and use it without
any major configuration changes.  If this rule is not followed, people will
stop testing kernel.org kernels and we'll all suffer from that.
Now, in my not so humble opinion, switching from bcm43xx to b43 _is_ a major
configuration change (I did it, so please don't try to discuss with my
experience) and forcing users to do that breaks the rule above.

Yes, as far as new distributions are concerned.  However, we _want_ kernel.org
kernels to work with the old ones too.  Yes, WE DO.

Given specific software environment (it may be a home-made system compiled
from sources or whatever), if installing a new kernel forces me to reconfigure
it in any significant way to obtain the functionality that I previously had,
the problem is with the kernel.  No less, no more.

It's not that simple.  For example, regression testing will be a major PITA
if one needs to switch back and forth from the new driver to the old one in the
process.
