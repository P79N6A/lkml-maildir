I just tried 'wpe'. The debuger is 'gdb'. If I select
'Option-Debuger-FullScreenMode', then there's no output from the debugged
execute file, buf I still can input.  If I select 'Option-Debuger-NormalMode',
neither can I input, nor can I see the output.
Since many people highly recommended 'wpe', there maybe something I
missed/wrong in the configuration of 'wpe', What's it?
