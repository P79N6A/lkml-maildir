A change to a 12:20 major:minor dev_t would be a great help for the various
serial drivers that I write and help maintain.  We currently as a company
maintain 4 different serial device drivers for linux and all of them
currently use between 4 and 10 majors in order to have enough raw minors
available to identify the maximum port count supported.  We had to do the
same think on SunOS (which also has 8:8) in order to support reasonable port
counts there.  I'd absoultely love the ability to get back on a single major
per driver.
I'd like to see all of the serial drivers shipped in the kernel tree be
configured by default to use the same major.. but I wouldn't want to have
external drivers forced onto that major as well.
