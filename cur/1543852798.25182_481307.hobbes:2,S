nice measurements and interesting results.
note that with a tasklet a 'retry' will often be done on the /same/ CPU 
that was running the tasklet when we tried to schedule it. I.e. such a 
'collision' will result not only in the 'loss' of the local rebalance 
event, but also causes /another/ rebalance event on the remote CPU.
so a better model would be the trylock model i suggested in the previous 
mail: to just lose the rebalance events upon collision and not cause 
extra work on the remote CPU. I'd also suggest to keep the rebalancing 
code under the irqs-off section, like it is currently - only do it 
conditional on trylock success. Do you think that would work?
