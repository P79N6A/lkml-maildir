I guess I'm confused here... all I said was I wanted them to be 
systematic, and not need ad-hoc interfaces.  In particular, I really 
don't want to see an interface where "oh, the fifth parameter is really 
a flags field so it's passed with sys_indirect, and is only accessible 
via a sys_indirect" is the norm.
We don't have all that many; pselect() being the main one (I think there 
might be a handful more on 32-bit platforms, but not positive.)  It 
introduced the convention of pointing argument register 6 to a 
user-space data structure.  Simple, and as you correctly point out, it's 
a comparatively rare case.  In klibc, I currently handle it as a special 
case, but I would prefer to avoid special cases of that sort going forward.
Note that on s390, 6-parameter system calls are already a special case: 
anything with over 5 parameters is invoked via a memory structure.  This 
actually means that for pselect on s390, we indirect via a memory 
structure not once, but twice, for no good reason.
