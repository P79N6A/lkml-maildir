_I_ do not want to run LSM with containers, but this was a requirement
from some people when we decided which approach to chose - LSM of mine.
Nevertheless, this is not very important, indeed.

The namespace-based virtualization implies no performance overhead for 
a container, actually. This is not xen or vmware where performance 
loss is OK.
Besides, I've measured some things - the lat_syscall test for open from 
lmbench test suite and the nptl perf test. Here are the results:
        sec     nosec
open    3.0980s  3.0709s
nptl    2.7746s  2.7710s
So we have 0.88% loss in open and ~0.15% with nptl. I know, this is not that
much, but it is noticeable. Besides, this is only two tests, digging deeper
may reveal more.
Let alone the fact that simply turning the CONFIG_SECURITY to 'y' puts +8Kb 
to the vmlinux...
I think, I finally agree with you and Al Viro, that the kobj mapper is 
not the right place to put the filtering, but taking the above numbers 
into account, can we put the "hooks" into the #else /* CONFIG_SECURITY */
versions of security_inode_permission/security_file_permission/etc?
