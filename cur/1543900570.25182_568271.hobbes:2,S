I measure it on my IBM T42 with CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME=y. The boot-up time
is about 4.35s from kexec is issued to root mounted in kexec kernel.
I think it is possible to optimize. Maybe the kexec kernel can
be hibernate/resume by the normal kernel too. This way, a real
kexec/boot-up is only needed for the first time.

Sorry, typo problem. The URL should be:

I reserved 16M RAM. I think this is sufficient for a simple disk based
hibernation.

a and b has no meaning. They are only used to trigger the resume
process. This will be fixed in the future version.

This is patch against kexec-tools, which is a userspace tool. So printf
is used. The commented code is just as other cmdline_add_xxx functions
of kexec-tools. But it is useless, and should be removed.
