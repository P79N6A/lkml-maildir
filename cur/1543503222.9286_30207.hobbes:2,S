Hello,
I'd just bought a new keyboard with some (14) extra _multimedia_ keys
(like Vol+,Vol- etc.), and i was unable to find a proper solution.
I would like to bind such key to a program executed, but running with user
ID which typed that key.
perhaps someone looked already into this ?
Thanks,
Arjan Filius

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
