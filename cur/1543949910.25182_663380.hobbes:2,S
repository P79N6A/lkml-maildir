Hi Linus,

The problem occurs when Smack is built-in the kernel but not chosen
to register itself on boot. Smack was not chosen on boot cause either
security=AnotherLSM or security=NonExistentLSM.
In all cases, init_smk_fs() ,which registers smackfs, got called
cause it's an __initcall(init_smack_fs). 
This include the cases where smack __was not__ chosen on boot.
Making smackfs mountable when Smack is not registered leads to:
1- an Oops by dereferncing the NULL security pointer: current->security (*)
2- Smackfs code got executed though naturally all the code assumes
   that smack is already registered with the security system leading
   to several problems.
3- The bogus idea of having a subsystem interface available when the
   subsystem itself is not available!
So the global is used in init_smk_fs to not register smackfs if
Smack wasn't enabled on boot.
---- SELinux:
I think the SELinux folks faced the same problem too. In my first 
local iteration of the security= parameter patch, I forgot to set 
`selinux_disable = 1' if SELinux wasn't chosen on boot.
This led to dozen of SELinux Udev events and also led to selinuxfs 
being available even though SELinux hooks _weren't_ registered.
Regards,
(*) 
    Could not save the oops cause it occured too early, but
    it was like this:
    __init_call
    init_smk_fs(void)
    smk_unlbl_ambient(NULL)
    /* 
     * Here: current->security = NULL, cause SMACK initial setup
     * was not executed.
     */
    smack_to_secid(current->security) 
    strncmp(.., current->security, ..)
