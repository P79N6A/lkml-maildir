kernel/printk.c: document possible deadlock against scheduler
The printk's comment states that it can be called from every context,
which might lead to false illusion that it could be called from everywhere
without any restrictions.
This is however not true - a call to printk() could deadlock if called from
scheduler code (namely from schedule(), wake_up(), etc) on runqueue lock
when it tries to wake up klogd. Document this.

  * This is printk().  It can be called from any context.  We want it to work.

  * We try to grab the console_sem.  If we succeed, it's easy - we log the output and
