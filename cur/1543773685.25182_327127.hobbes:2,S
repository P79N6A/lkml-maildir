I'm sorry, but I'm not getting your point:
First, you ACK the part of my patch to #if 0 unused functions.
Then you complain that I've documented which EXPORT_SYMBOL's I have to 
remove because I have #if 0'ed the functions they are exporting.
Will the patch be OK for you if I'll simply remove the part of the patch 
description stating which of the #if 0'ed functions had been exported?
