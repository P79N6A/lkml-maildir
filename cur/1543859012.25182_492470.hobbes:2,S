I would suggest that we make the prefix MODULE and not EXPORT.  It
more accurately conveys what we are trying to say, and it doesn't
have the conflicting problem with INTERNAL.
I don't know if it is actually worth doing a great rename for such
a simple clarification in language.  But it is worth considering
because it would more strongly convey that we don't expect these
symbols to be used by everything.
