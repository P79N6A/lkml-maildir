Subject: [RFC][PATCH] /proc/pid/maps doesn't match "ipcs -m" shmid

Hi Eric,
Your recent cleanup to shm code, namely
[PATCH] shm: make sysv ipc shared memory use stacked files
took away one of the debugging feature for shm segments.
Originally, shmid were forced to be the inode numbers and
they show up in /proc/pid/maps for the process which mapped
this shared memory segments (vma listing). That way, its easy
to find out who all mapped this shared memory segment. Your
patchset, took away the inode# setting. So, we can't easily
match the shmem segments to /proc/pid/maps easily. (It was
really useful in tracking down a customer problem recently). 
Is this done deliberately ? Anything wrong in setting this back ?
Comments ?
Thanks,
Badari

Here is the patch.
"ino#" in /proc/pid/maps used to match "ipcs -m" output for shared 
memory (shmid). It was useful in debugging, but its changed recently. 
This patch sets inode number to shared memory id to match /proc/pid/maps.
