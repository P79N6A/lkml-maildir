This has been mostly covered, but just in case.  There are two different
freezes, the kernel, and in reiserfs.  The reiserfs part isn't something
Alan or Linus have imposed on us, we just wanted to limit the reiserfs
changes as much as possible during the early kernel releases.
The end result is that some larger scale issues are unfixed (memory
pressure from VM, lost files after a crash), but we have been able to focus
on the critical hoses-my-files/crashes-my-box kinds of bugs.
