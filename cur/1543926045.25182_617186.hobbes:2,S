I think the problem is that certain mail headers show up multiple
times and this makes it look like a looping email so we toss it.
I suspect the one you really need to block out is X-MailingList
or similar.
Why don't you do a few tries and I'll try to remember to keep an
eye out for the bounces?
Thanks.
