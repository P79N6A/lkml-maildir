Hello again,
I'm writing this mail as I'm discovering ACPI related problems on my Acer 
TravelMate 800LCi notebook with Linux 2.6.1-rc1-mm1.
While the system boots up fine with Linux 2.6.1-rc1, with 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 it
hangs while booting. The last message printed to screen is "ACPI: IRQ 9 
was Edge Triggered, setting to Level Triggerd". This is fully reproducable 
with a Linux 2.6.0 kernel which has the ACPI20031203 patch applied.
Just for the records, with 2.6.1-rc1, the message that comes right after
the "ACPI: IRQ 9 ..." message is:
evxfevnt-0093 [04] acpi_enable           : Transition to ACPI mode successful
Is this a known problem and if so is a fix available?
