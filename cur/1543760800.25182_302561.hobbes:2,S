This is a bad idea. Users should not be allowed to
make this decision. This is rightly a decision for
the admin to make.
Note: I'm the procps (ps, top, w, etc.) maintainer.
Probably I'd have to make /bin/ps run setuid root
to deal with this. (minor changes needed) The same
goes for /usr/bin/top, which I know is currently
unsafe and difficult to fix.
Let's not go there, OK?
If you restricted this new ability to root, then I'd
have much less of an objection. (not that I'd like it)
