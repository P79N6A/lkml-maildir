Yes, that helps a lot.  I had actually already implemented something 
like that :).  But that's a different thing than avoiding the lock.
It's just that with the I2C stuff, you may be calling kref_put() 20-30 
times for a single operation.  That's a lot of lock/unlock operations.  
But it is wierd, so I understand.  Thanks.

Just doing an atomic operation is not faster than doing a lock, an 
atomic operation, then an unlock?  Am I missing something?
