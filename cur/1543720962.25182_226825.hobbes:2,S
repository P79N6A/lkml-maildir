Machines big enough that such big hashes make sense are probably NUMA.
And on NUMA systems you imho should rather use node interleaving vmalloc(),
not a bit physical allocation on a specific node for these hashes. 
This will avoid memory controller hot spots and avoid the problem completely.
Likely it will perform better too.
