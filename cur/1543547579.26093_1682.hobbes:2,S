I'm not thinking about hidden addresses. Just there are boxes and switches
with ARP filters that may expect certain source addresses in the ARP, and 
changing it may break it (and others break in the current way, sigh)

You have no link to prefsrc from the neighbour, so you would need to cache
it in addition in the dst_entry. Doing it twice is probably not useful.
