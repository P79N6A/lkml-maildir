Oh, you saw the light. (-: I can assure you that most file systems make 
such assumptions. Certainly NTFS does... I designed the driver all around 
caching metadata to optimize access to actual data. Once I enable 
direct_IO, I plan to keep all metadata caching in place, just stop caching 
the actual file data. That should give maximum performance I think.

What does "GC" mean?
