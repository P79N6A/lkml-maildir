If Linux is going to offer a feature like this then people have to be able
to trust it to be quite secure.  What we don't want to happen is to
distribute it for six months and then be buried in reports of
vulnerabilites from cryptography specialists.  Even worse if those reports
lead to exploits.
So I guess what I'm asking is: has this code been reviewed by crypto
experts?  Bearing in mind that it'll be world-class crypto people who will
try to poke holes in it.
