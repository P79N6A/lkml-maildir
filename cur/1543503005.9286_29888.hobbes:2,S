It's called "memory mapped IO" and "IO memory" is a word that you can
decypher the moment you hear it. So, let me say for the record: I like
it.
Linus, wasn't it your intention to have the Linux "mm" tree grab
   0x00000000 - 0x000a0000 & 
   0x00100000 - 0x04000000(*)    
as the "iomem" (commonly known as main memory) regions that it would
handle, leaving the 640k-1M region free for real IOmem? Wouldn't the
vmalloc be supposed to grab:
   0x04800000 - 0x08800000 ? 
and things like that? This would make the name "io memory" even too
specific. But still, iomem is in my opinion a much better name than
something that has "pci".
			Roger.
