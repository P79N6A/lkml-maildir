Interesting. He also apparently boots with "noapic nolapic" on the "386" 
kernel, but not the "686" kernel. I wonder what the differences in Kubuntu 
kernels are between 386/686 kernels. Is it _just_ the CPU type? If so, the 
largest difference is probably just compiler instruction usage/scheduling.
Ben?
Also, the 686 one apparently boots with "acpi=off" or "pci=noacpi" 
(although then some interrupts don't work, which I guess shouldn't be a 
huge surprise). I do wonder if maybe we have a miscompile issue.
There are a few (but really not very many) other differences between M386 
and M686 kernels too. Notably CMPXCHG/XADD isn't used unconditionally on 
the M386 kernel. That impacts the new mutex code (it adds a few 
conditional jumps, but still ends up using XADD since the CPU actually 
supports it).
