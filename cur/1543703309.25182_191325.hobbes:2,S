So why not simply iterate across it with test_bit()?
	val = 0;
	for (bit = maskbytes * 8; bit >= 0; bit--) {
		val <<= 1;
		if (__test_bit(maskp, bit))
			val |= 1;
		if ((bit & 15) == 15) {
			sprintf(buf, "%x", val);
			buf++;
			val = 0;
		}
	}
(plus bounds checking, null-termination, etc)?  It is hardly
performance-critical.
