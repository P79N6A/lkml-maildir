Subject: Burning CDs with a CD-ROM is a bad idea

Hello folks,
Yesterday I made a slight thinko while attempting to burn a CD.  Rather 
than specifying dev=/dev/hdd, I add dev=/dev/hdc, which is my CD-ROM 
drive rather than my cd burner.  Whoops!
Now, I believe I've done this before, and recieved an error message.  
However, in this particular case with 2.6.6, the system behaved a bit 
different.

It's been a day, and cdrecord is still trying.  I've tried cancelling or 
killing cdrecord with no avail.

This seems like the wrong behavior to me.  What I'm not sure of though is 
if this is a kernel bug, or some sort of problem with cdrecord.  Thoughts?
