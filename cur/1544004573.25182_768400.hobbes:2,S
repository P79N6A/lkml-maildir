Hi all,
1. we should init the kref of tty which used as a fake tty in usb
serial console setup function.
2. Fix can't open /dev/console bug when the console is a usb serial device.
With these two patches we can boot and login successfully on an Eee PC
with a pl2303 usb serial as console.
Thanks,
Kevin
