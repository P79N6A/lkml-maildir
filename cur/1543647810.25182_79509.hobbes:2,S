Where is the hack? The ppc64 early console code uses a hypervisor call
or a serial port routine which have no business being in a generic
console infrastructure.
At the moment its two lines called before start_kernel to register the
console, and 4 lines of disable_early_printk. We use existing routines
to talk to the hypervisor or serial console.
How is the reworked console system going to reduce this? :)
