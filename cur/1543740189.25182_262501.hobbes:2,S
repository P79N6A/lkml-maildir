If we rip out the code folks will stop sending in bug reports on it.  Simple as 
that.

As I recall the problem was that uptime was not matching the elapsed wall clock. 
  This was because it was jiffies based and the 1/HZ assumption was made about 
what a jiffie is.  When jiffies became ~1/HZ instead of =1/HZ we started all the 
"good times".  And, this was done because 1/HZ could not be obtained with the 
PIT interrupt source with enought accuracy to satisfy ntp code.

The can of worms here is decoupling jiffies from the timer interrupt.  Jiffies 
is (like it or not) the unit of measure used for timers and these _require_ and 
interrupt AND it should be consistantly within a few 10s of usec of when the 
jiffie changes.

As mention by me (a long time ago), this assumes you have a better source for 
the clock than the interrupt.  I would argue that on the x86 (which I admit is 
really deficient) the best long term clock is, in fact, the PIT interrupt.  The 
_best_ clock on the x86, IMHO, is one that used the PIT interrupt as the gold 
standard.  Then one smooths this to eliminate interrupt latency issues and lost 
ticks using the TSC.   The pm_timer is as good as the PIT but suffers from 
access time issues.
