Hi,
	Could someone tell me (or at least point me to the docs that
answer my questions) what the current system limits are for Linux? Some of
the limits I had in mind are (1) Memory (2) Max. number of processes (3)
Max. number of userids (4) Largest filesystem size (5) Largest disk it can
handle (runtime and / or boot time).
	I need this information to put in a FAQ.
Thanks in advance,
Kenneth Stephen
