Thanks for the reminder, I forgot to remove the feature-removal-schedule
entry last time you asked.
We really can't remove ip_queue. Many users use this, there is no binary
compatible interface and even the compat replacement for the originally
statically linked library doesn't work. There is also no real necessity
to remove the code, so the feature-removal-schedule entry should be
removed instead.
Dave, please apply this patch. Thanks.
