In spite of that, it should be considered. It allows this:
$ ls -log /proc/self/fd
total 0
lrwx------    1 acahalan       64 Sep 21 09:12 0 -> /dev/pts/4
lrwx------    1 acahalan       64 Sep 21 09:12 1 -> /dev/pts/4

Alternately, it allows this:
$ ls -log /proc/self/fd

It goes into the kernel structure, so that it won't be Wine-specific.
SGI has already done this so that Samba would interact properly with
regular UNIX software and the NFS server.
(one might support SGI's API for this)

Yep, share bits definitely belong in the kernel. How else could
you properly protect against regular (clueless) Linux software?

We already have 3 ways to do file locking, so this is only 33% more.

Now THAT would be a disaster. Linux software ought to be able to rely
on having these features available. Modules are very bad for this.
Look, we don't have flock() in a module.

Named? That means you use the VFS.

The sendfile() call is mandatory.
The real-time schedular and signals are mandatory.
The clone() call is mandatory.
The prctl() call is mandatory.
See a pattern here? System calls are not supposed to be modular.
We shouldn't have calls that appear and disappear on a whim.
Binary compatibility requires that system calls be available on
all Linux systems.
