Yes, they will be used. But the intent is to be used by system/security
administrators and not by the everyday user. If there are 32765 (or 255
for that matter) privileged programs, then I would be willing to guarantee
that the security on that system is nonexistant. The ability to audit
the security activities of programs is a must. I have enough trouble with
just the 55 I have. If I find any others on the system, they get removed.
Capabilities themselves are not safe. They are used to make a system safe.
The process of making the system safe requires validation of the programs
being given extra privileges. Otherwise, you have no assurance that security
policies are being enforced.
