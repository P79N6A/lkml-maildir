That's doable, but frankly I don't like the idea.

Please note that the relocating code uses the page flags to mark the allocated
pages as well as to avoid the pages that should not be used.  In my opinion
no userspace process should be allowed to fiddle with the page flags.
Moreover, get_safe_page() is called directly by the arch code on x86-64,
so it has to stay in the kernel and hence it should be in snapshot.c.
OTOH the relocating code is nothing more than "if the page is not safe,
use get_safe_page() to allocate one" kind of thing, so I don't see a point
in taking it out of the kernel (in the future) too.

Well, after the patches that are already in -mm we don't use any additional
data structures for this purpose, so that's not a problem, I think. ;-)

We don't.  All memory allocated with either get_image_page() or
get_safe_page() will eventually be released by swsusp_free(), no matter
what happens.
