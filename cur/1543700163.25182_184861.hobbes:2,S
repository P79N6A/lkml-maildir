Yes, high speed USB transfers need the EHCI driver.
If that driver isn't running, then OHCI (or UHCI)
should kick in.  (Assuming that driver is running!)
Most high speed storage seems to work with the current
EHCI code, although some hardware acts unhappy when
Linux talks to it faster than Windows does.  That's
more of an issue on 2.6 than on 2.4 though.
