	Forgive me for jumping in late on this one - I have just one
observation.  It isn't clear to me that it would work well to have a
single queue per device, at least in all cases.  Some host adapters have
limits (sometimes in hardware, not just a driver limitation) on the
maximum number of outstanding commands, and it would take a bit of hacking
to find a way to pick commands from multiple queues in order to prevent
starvation.  For host adapters that have no such limits, then a per-device
queue would work just fine.
