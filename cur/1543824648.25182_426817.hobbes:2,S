Subject: [PATCH] ufs: Unmark CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE as BROKEN -mm tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/25/58

To find new bugs, I suggest revert this patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/31/275
in -mm tree.
So anybody except me can test "write support" of UFS.

 	  Say Y here if you want to try writing to UFS partitions. This is
 	  experimental, so you should back up your UFS partitions beforehand.
