Hmmm you're right.  Is your security work going into the next -mm?  If
so, I'll just re-base this cleanup patch on that ... at the very least
I want to get rid of afs_dir_put_page().  Also, did you consider
passing the key pointer directly and modifying the readpage actor to
simply cast the pointer back, like read_mapping_page(mapping, page,
(struct file *)key)?  It seems like a waste to allocate a whole file
struct on the stack just for the ->private field.
Andrew in the mean time just disregard this patch.
