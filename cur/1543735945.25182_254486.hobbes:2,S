Assuming this is desirable (otherwise, why would you have written it?)
(1) uts_sem isn't the right lock.
(2) You acquire uts_sem under tasklist_lock, a deadlock.
(3) It would probably make more sense to dynamically register and
	unregister the various criteria for exempt processes than mess
	with space-separated fields of a single string.
