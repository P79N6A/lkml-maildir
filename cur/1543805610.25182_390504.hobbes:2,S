Umm yes, then *after* aquiring the different one, A would like to
retake the original mutex.

No, not immediately, I said "for a very long time". As in: A does not
need the exclusion provided by the lock for a very long time so it
drops it to avoid needless contention, then reaquires it when it finally
does need the lock.

No, we're talking about what happens when A tries to aquire it again.
Just accept that my described scenario is legitimate then consider it in
isolation rather than getting caught up in the superfluous details of how
such a situation might come about.
