Try to connect them to a different switch.
I had the same problem with some XP1000s some years ago. It went away when 
I connected them to a different switch. Since then, the machines have been 
on four different switches, and only had the problem with one of them. 
Strangely it was an expensive managed switch that didn't work, while two 
el cheapo 8 port switches had no problems. Somewhere I read this was a 
hardware bug of the cards.
Good luck!
