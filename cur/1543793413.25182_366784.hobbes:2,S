I agree, and I was not arguing for or against breaking ndiswrapper. I think 
it's an interesting (and difficult) problem to solve if 4K-stacks gets in.
LWN has a piece on the possible options, but I suppose you could use the 
argument that forcibly breaking ndiswrapper will spur new driver development 
(but if you look at vendors like Broadcom, they have seem consistently 
unwilling to do this).
