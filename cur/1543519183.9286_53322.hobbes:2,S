I've seen that beasts :-) They are history now for long time. DOS is not
history yet (look for headers of my mails for proof :-)

Yes, there was "official" encoding (GOST one). Noone used it anyway.

There was tens of them. Three are still alive (cp866, koi8-r, windows-1251).

Oh, yeah :-)

No, glibc is not insisting that iso8859-5 is One True Way(tm) anymore. Just
locale "ru_RU" using it (and locale "russian" is alias for "ru_RU"). You can
use "ru_RU.koi8-r" just fine. It's just innocent russian users who tried to use
"russian" locale and got weird result who are affected (they will get mesagges
just fine since [almost] ALL software is russified via koi8-r; including mc,
GNOME and other FSF's goodies -- just glibc prefer iso8859-5 and so when you
are trying to use "russian" locale you'll get correct russian messages but
garbage instead of Months names and such)...
