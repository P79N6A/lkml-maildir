You rebuilt the kernel (or bridge module), but did not install the updated
modules.  The module versioning code checks that any module loaded was
built from the same source as the kernel itself. In your case the bridge
module does not correspond to the running kernel.  If you are doing
your own kernel builds, you need to do:
	make modules_install
	make install
