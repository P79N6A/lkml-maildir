Hi Brandon,
You said (amongst other things):
> I love the idea of /proc/.config as put forth in Tigran's patch.
If even one human needs this feature I will continue to maintain it as a
separate patch (until I decide that something better supersedes it).
Give me time - I will upgrade the patch to 2.2.5. But from a few recent
mails on KML I learned how one can use ld scripts and ld -r to encode
arbitrary binary data into the object file. I liked this better than what
I have done in mkdconfig.sh script because it is more generic. So I intend
to redo /proc/.config patch using the ld stuff.
It will be always available at the URL somewhere in my .signature.
Regards,
