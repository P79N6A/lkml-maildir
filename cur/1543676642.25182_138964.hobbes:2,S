Coding style is secondary.  It doesn't effect the compiled code.  That
simple.
In the case of the kernel, there is quite a bit of horrible coding
style.  But a working device driver for some hardware is always better
that no working device driver for some hardware, and if enforcing the
coding style more results is scaring away some driver writers, the
style clearly loses.
