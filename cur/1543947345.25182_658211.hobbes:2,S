The above deserved to be quoted...  just because I agree with all of it 
so strongly :)
Bugs really do "hide" in ugly code, in part because my brain has been 
optimized to review clean code.
Like everything else in life, one must strike a balance between picking 
style nits with someone's patch, and making honest criticisms of a patch 
because said patch is too "unclean" to be reviewed by anyone.
