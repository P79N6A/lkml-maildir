The point is that people making changes to the filesystem interfaces
will be much more likely to notice and fix stuff that is under fs/
than code that is buried deep under arch/ somewhere.  Filesystems
should go under fs/ for the sake of long-term maintainability.  The
fact that it's only used on one architecture is irrelevant - you
simply make sure (with the appropriate Kconfig bits) that it's only
offered on that architecture.
Paul.
