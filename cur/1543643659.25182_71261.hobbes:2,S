Runnable can be done currently, blocked on IO is trivial once
Andrew has pushed the iowait stats to Linus.
Swapped doesn't make any sense at the moment, but it should.
A system without load control is just too vulnerable to sudden
load spikes. If Andrew has interest I'll pick up the work I
did in that area ...
I'll also update vmstat to just use /proc/stat instead of
looking at all /proc/*/stat files.
cheers,
Rik
