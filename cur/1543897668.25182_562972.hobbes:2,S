Dan, I hope you will release these as a patchset against 2.6.22 when 
it's out or 2.6.21. I find I have a lot more confidence in results, good 
or bad, when comparing something I have run in production with just one 
patchset added. There are enough other changes in an -rc to confuse the 
issue, and I don't run them in production (at least not usually).
