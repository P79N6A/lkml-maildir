Agreed.

Yes.  It's interesting that comparing the differences in north bridge
registers between windows unpatched, and the latest 1.05 raid patch is
just register 0xb7 changing.  Perhaps I'll be 'brave/foolish' and just
twiddle it with setpci after backing up.  Do you have documentation 
for these registers ?  I've been kicking through via's site looking 
for chipset datasheets to no avail.
I toasted one of my raid disks trying to get Win98se installed over
the weekend to do similar testing here.  Didn't like the size of the
disk I tried to install it to, and I ended up with a zapped partition
table and who knows what else.  Thankfully the software raid 5 coped
perfectly (thanks guys!) and the system was back after the rebuild
time.
I've a spare (small) disk to try this with my system today or
tomorrow.  Which ABit bios are you using on that test system currently
?  I put the newest ABios bios (7P vs 65)  on my system (KT7A-RAID
v1.3)  and it appears to have gained me about 3-4MB/sec over the PCI
bus. (54MB/sec vs 50MB/sec)
Attached files are my raw pci data for 00:0 and 00:1, for your 
reference.  It's different enough to your data that it's not easy
to compare though.
Cheers,
Mark
