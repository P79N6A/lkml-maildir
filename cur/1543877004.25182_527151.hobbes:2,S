Get rid of the word "new" - it won't continue to be a "new" feature forever :-)

In the first two lines you Capitalize Each Word, but in the last line
you don't - why?
Shouldn't the first two have "Number of" prepended?
Perhaps it's just me, but I would write "(optional)" instead of "(option)".
In short, I'd suggest this :
           * Number of involuntary context switches
           * Number of voluntary context switches
           * Number of system calls (optional)

What about tools that currently parse /proc/PID/status ?  Don't you
risk breaking userland stuff by changing this file?   Wouldn't it be
better to use a new file?

Capitalize the first word; "Enable syscall counter" .

I'd probably have written "This option adds a syscall counter to
/proc/PID/status."
