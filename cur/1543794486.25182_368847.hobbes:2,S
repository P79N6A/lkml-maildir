Good point.  However the foo.pid scheme is incompatible with
checkpoint/restart and migration regardless.
	a. what good is trying to kill something using such a file if
	the process is checkpointed+killed, to be restarted later?
	b. it is expected that any files used by a checkpointable
	processes exist on a network fs, so that the fd can be moved.
	What good is foo.pid if it's on a network filesystem?
So if you wanted to checkpoint and restart/migrate a process with a
foo.pid type of file, you might need to start it with a private
tmpfs in a private namespace.  That part is trivial to do as part
of the management tools, though checkpointing a whole tmpfs per process
could be unfortunate.
