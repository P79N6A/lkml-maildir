ZONE_DMA is a memory area that is needed by an arch for devices that 
cannot do DMA to all of memory. The high boundary is set by 
MAX_DMA_ADDRESS.

We already have 4 arches now that do not need ZONE_DMA at all.
ZONE_DMA does not have a bright future with IOMMUs and other things 
around. None of my system uses ZONE_DMA and I have a variety of them.
And yes if we do not have this facility in the kernel then distros cannot 
pick it up. At least on IA64 I know that hardware from the major vendors 
has not been needing ZONE_DMA for a while now.
Also ZONE_DMA is a very bad concept. Multiple drivers may have different 
address requirements. What we need is some way for a driver to tell the 
kernel what the required range of addresses is. If a device is only 
capable of handling 30 valid address bits then we may have to use 
ZONE_DMA and only allow the use of the lower 16MB. It would be better to 
develop a different mechanism.
