Subject: [PATCH 5/5] m68k: fix NBPG define
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The recent header cleanup removed PAGE_SIZE from the exported
information as it depends on the configuration.
BTW This has possibly other consequences, as the core dump code is using
PAGE_SIZE directly, which may need fixing as well.
