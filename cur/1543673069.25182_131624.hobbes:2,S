Nope, thats just a standard DVD; its plugged into one channel of a
Promise Ultra100 TX2; an Iomega Zip 100 is a slave on the same channel.
Everything works fine - the only problem is the log messages from audio
playing. /proc/ide/hde/settings is:

My full set of IDE stuff is:
On board AMD 766 ViperPlus IDE:
   hda - IBM Deathstar 60GB
   hdc - Memorex CD-RW with ide-scsi
Promise Ultra100 TX2
   hde - the offending DVD ROM
   hdf - Iomega ZIP 100 ATAPI
   hdg - IBM Deathstar 60GB

I guess I was really after a /proc/ide/hd?/verbosity to shut the drive
up independent of what application was trying to talk to it.
