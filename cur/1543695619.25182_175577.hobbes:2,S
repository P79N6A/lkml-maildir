I had the same problem on a K6-2 with some Asus MB. Both Realtek 8139
and tulip (21140) refused to work in a PCI slot. Realtek gave these
messages, tulip told that send timed out. A quick workaround was to put
the NIC into another PCI slot. I don't know the real reason and I don't
have the specific computer available for additional tests any more.
