A lot of machines don't have very accurate bus-clock crystals and
many are now using #%$@*&$ PZST piezoelectric resonators because
they are cheap. Here is a log of once-a-day setting of my time-server
against NIST. This is a dual pentium 400MHz 'Thunder' board.

As you can see, it typically loses 15 seconds per day. Since the
time is reset every day at around midnight, it's not too bad.
