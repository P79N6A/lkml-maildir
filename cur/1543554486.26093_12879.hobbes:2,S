I'm working on some timer routines to allow arbitrary numbers of timers
all based off the single real timer provided by "setitimer".  However, I
haven't been able to figure out from the documentation what happens to
the countdown timer used by setitimer when the system clock is changed
(by root, for instance).  If I move the system clock forward or backward
a few seconds, is the itimer affected by this at all (I hope not) or can
I simply ignore it (I hope so).
Thanks,
Chris
