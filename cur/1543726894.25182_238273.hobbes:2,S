If you're like me and most of the other developers, you've already got a 
to-do list a mile long.  For me hitting myself on the head with a hammer 
is pretty low. ;)

The problem is that __REALLY_HAVE_FOO is usually just (__HAVE_FOO && 
CONFIG_FOO) on Linux.  They appear to be derived slightly differently on 
NetBSD and FreeBSD.  'grep __REALLY_HAVE drm_os_*bsd.h | grep define' in 
the bsd directory in the DRM tree.  Since there's just the three 
(__REALLY_HAVE_AGP, __REALLY_HAVE_SG, and __REALLY_HAVE_MTRR), I think 
we can live with them.
It shouldn't be too hard to get rid of __MUST_HAVE_AGP, though.
I think this is the right place to start.  A couple of these look easier 
to get rid of than others.  __HAVE_MTRR and __HAVE_AGP are enabled in 
every driver except ffb.  It should be easy enough to get rid of them. 
It looks like __HAVE_RELEASE, __HAVE_DMA_READY, __HAVE_DMA_FLUSH, 
__HAVE_DMA_QUIESCENT, and __HAVE_MULTIPLE_DMA_QUEUES (which looks broken 
anyway) should also be low-hanging fruit.
If we get that far, I think the next step would be to replace the 
DRIVER_* macros with a table of function pointers that would get passed 
around.  Since I doubt any of those uses are performance critical, that 
should be fine.
Then we can start looking at data structure refactoring.

There was a point when a *lot* of the device-dependent code was still in 
the OS-dependent directories.  This is how the i810 and i830 drivers 
still are.  I think as more of the code got moved into the 
OS-independent directory, it got less pleasant to read.
