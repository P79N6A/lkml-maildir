Sorry for the delay, but I have not had any time to really test this
again.  I did some minor testing, and only after really working it,
I could get an oops, but not nearly the same (think it was deeper into
the scsi layer or maybe kobject stuff).
Will see when I can get some time to try and generate some consistent
traces if any.
Thanks,
