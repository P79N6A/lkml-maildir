I agree and you can see that in fact, we don't have enough barrier on
the other side since spin_unlock doesn't prevent subsequent loads from
crossing a previous store...
I wonder if that's worth trying to address, adding a barrier in
handle_IRQ_event for example, or we can continue ignoring the barrier
and let some drivers do their own fixes in fancy ways.
