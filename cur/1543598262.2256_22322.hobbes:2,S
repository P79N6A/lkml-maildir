I had a similar problem which could be solved by either passing the "mem="
option at boot time as you suggest(in which case you permanently lose the
upper 32MB) or by using the /proc/mtrr interface ( as described in
Documentation/mtrr.txt) to assign the "missing" region. For your system you
might try something like:
echo "base=0x7e000000 size=0x2000000 type=write-back" >| /proc/mtrr
