I've been looking at the code and I think it could be extended a bit:
I've been thinking about how to best get rid of the thread manager for
thread creation in LinuxThreads.  It is currently needed to do the wait.
I think the easiest way is to just implement the Single Unix SA_NOCLDWAIT 
and add a prctl to set a queued exit signal to some arbitary pid. That pid 
could be the thread group so some thread would just handle it and do the 
necessary LinuxThreads bookkeeping.
The queued exit signal could carry which thread has died. The only tricky
issue is what to do when the exit signal cannot be queued because there
are too many threads in flight, in this case it makes sense to just make
it pending without any data (the thread library can search some global
data structure in this case)
All these changes are very easy.
