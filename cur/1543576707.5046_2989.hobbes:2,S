Hello,
I am not a linux kernel guy. I am running a spider that sometimes gets blocked
for long periods of time.  I run a "netstat -nto" and I observe a socket in 
state SYS_SENT that seems to be blocked. Its timer keeps on incrementing. 
Is there any way to avoid this blocking? Is this a bug in the kernel or
something wrong in my TCP/IP configuration/settings.
Thanks in advance, Joaquin
