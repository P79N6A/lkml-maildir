I may have worded the initial email a bit too heavily towards 8K
removal, but that was mainly to provoke some discussion.  Nothing
should get removed without a fair (and long) warning in
feature-removal-schedule.txt and ofcourse not before we know that the
new option is at least as safe as what we intend to remove, so the
patch really was just intended as a fairly harmless nudge towards
getting 4K stacks into a shape where we can eventually start
considering 8K removal.
