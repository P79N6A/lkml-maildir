Hi Im trying to install a driver i've made:
/sbin/insmod tm
./tm.o: unresolved symbol __divdi3
./tm.o: unresolved symbol inb
./tm.o: unresolved symbol __constant_memcpy
./tm.o: unresolved symbol __memcpy
./tm.o: unresolved symbol outb 
Lets see if i've got this right:
The divdi3 comes from the fact that the code
contains long divison ?  And that libgcc is
not a part of the kernel....how do i solve it ?
The inb and outb shouldn't they be supported ?
I have set: 
#included <asm/io.h> ......
And memcpy ans constant_memcpy i have tried 
to put in things like:
#include  <asm/string.h>
#include  <string.h>
The driver was compiled with gcc  -Wall -DMODULE -DLINUX -D__KERNEL__ -DHWDRIV -c tm.c -o tm.o 
(HWDRIV is my own)
Kernel version is 2.2.5-22
If anyone has got a clue CC: rg@irfu.se.
(Drivers are a mystery to man..
but i guess man is a mystery to a driver)
