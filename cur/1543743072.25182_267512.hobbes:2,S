Yes, there was a incorrect change to the "asmlinkage" definition that I 
had played with before deciding to make just the semaphores be reg-arg, 
and that change made it into my original patch by mistake. I sent out a 
second message asking people to remove that part of the patch some time 
later, but..

Just change the incorrect "3" in <asm-i386/linkage.h> (or whatever, this 
is from memory):
	#define asmlinkage CPP_ASMLINKAGE __attribute__((regparm(3)))
back to a "0". Asmlinkage still uses stack-based parameter passing, which
I'd love to fix eventually (we've had bugs in that area too), but it is
just too much pain to do right now.
