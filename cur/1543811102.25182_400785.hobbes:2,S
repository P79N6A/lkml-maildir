This may not be easy for me but I will try to get corp. approval(s).
Basically, the process that is, at least according to "top", showing ~5x
increased CPU usage is receiving very short UDP packets over a gigabit
interface at the rate of about 38,000 per second. UDP packets are small and
according to "/sbin/ifconfig" there are no errors, drops, overruns, frame or
carrier errors or collisions. (it is an isolated network of 20 PC3000s (3 GH
Xeon processors) at www.emulab.net.

The config file I had used to build the "RT" kernel can be found at:

I had tried to have all debug options off
