Media insertion is not notified to user space via udev, so userspace 
implement cd automount by polling.  IIRC, back when libata ATAPI support 
was premature, we had quite a few bug reports regarding error messages 
generated by those polling activities.  Maybe your distribution disabled 
polling for SCSI cdroms for that reason.  I seem to recollect the 
polling was done by some gnome daemon, not sure which though.
My memory is a bit vague about this.  Please correct me if I got 
something wrong.
