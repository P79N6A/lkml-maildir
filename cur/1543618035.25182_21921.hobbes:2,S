I suspect none of these "Heads" spend much time in protracted
email debug sessions.  Because the *first* thing you do is
ask the tester to compile the relevant driver into the
kernel.
The problems which the removal of this option will cause include:
1: Inability to look up symbols in the kernel elf image.
2: Breaks the kernel profiler
3: breaks kgdb
4: breaks ksymoops.
How often have we seen nonsensical backtraces here because
modules were involved?   Possibly we can include a table
of module base addresses in the Oops output and teach ksymoops
about it.
This proposal is, frankly, brain-damaged.  It will significantly
impeded kernel developers in remote problem diagnosis and it will
weaken the kernel development toolchain.
There's a lot of work to be done to overcome this damage, and
given the difficulty of getting debug tools into the mainstream
kernel, the damage may well be permanent.
