Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/2] dmaengine: preparation for raid acceleration

Hello David,
The following two patches are part of the raid acceleration series I
would like to push for 2.6.23 consideration.  I am sending these two
separately for your review for the following reasons: the 'dmaengine'
core initially came in through netdev,  patch #2 makes changes to
net/dev/core.c, and lastly I have an ack on the raid changes but no ack
from the community on the i/oat and dmaengine changes.
      dmaengine: add base support for the async_tx api
      dmaengine: move channel management to the client
Regards,
Dan
