I just duplicated the banners from init/main.c and tacked some extra bits on
the front.

So that it get built and placed in an archive library, thus allowing the
linker to decide whether to include it or not, without having to use
conditional stuff and without having to change every other arch to enable it.
I suppose I could do something like this in init/Makefile:
	if ($(CONFIG_DISABLE_GENERIC_CALIBRATE_DELAY),y)
	obj-y += calibrate.o
	endif
That would allow me to avoid having to change all the archs.
