Please explain further.
Just leaving it at that is not nice. What is messy?
The implementation? The API?
If you have a better solutions for allocating big chunks of
physical continious memory at different stages during the
runtime of the kernel, i would be very interesseted.
(Alan: bootmem allocation just won't do. I need that memory
in modules which get potentially loaded/unloaded, hence a
wrapper interface for allowing access to a bootmem allocated
piece of memory)
And the API? That API was set a long time ago, luckely not by me :)
Though I dont see the real problem. It allows allocation and
freeing of chunks of memory. Period. Its all its suppose to do.
Or do you want it rolled in kmalloc? So GFP_DMA with size>128K
would take memory from this? That would mean a much more intrusive
patch in very sensitive and rapidly changing parts of the kernel
(2.2->2.4 speaking)...
