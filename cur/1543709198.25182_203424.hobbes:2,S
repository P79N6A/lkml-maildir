The kernel will never send a signal 9 to init. However, it can
send many other signals. If the signal handler in init got
corrupt from a buffer overrun, bad memory, etc., it's quite
possible for init to die. When it dies, it would usually
die as a result of a seg-fault. You can observe /proc/1/cwd to
see where init lives. There may be a core-file in that directory.
The core-file might be able to give you a hint. Also, somebody
who has su privs can `cp /dev/random /dev/initctl` with some
interesting results.
Cheers,
