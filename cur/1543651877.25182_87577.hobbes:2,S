I am pretty familiar with the build process and kernel install for a
single Linux box, but I wanted to confirm I'm doing things in a sane way
for a large deployment. All the machines are the same hardware and
running standard setups.
First, I plan on compiling the kernel on a development box. From there
my plan is basically tar /usr/src/linux, copy to each box, untar, copy
bzImage and System.map to /boot, run make modules_install, edit
lilo.conf, run lilo.
Tips? Comments?
Thanks 
Matt
