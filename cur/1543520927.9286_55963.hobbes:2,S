This is a very poor point .. where I personally can say 'No, I am not still
using my 386 DOS machine...'  There are still many people out there using
these machines.
Our company runs an international internet contest, and some of our past
(and present) entries come from users which are still using 386+486
machines... There are some places in the world inwhich the price of
upgrading is too expensive, or it is just not easy to upgrade to the latest
machines.
We had a brief discussion about this on the Debian list, and there too,
there are still those that have such machines in active use.
Albeit, the 386 is not that old (old by computer standards, but not old by
'human' years .. ), and a lot can change in 38 years, but that all depends
on when the 'last' 32bit machine is produced and when the bigger and better
ones come out .. (ie, if cheap-home-use 32bit machines are around for
another 10 years or so .. then your point above will be just as poor in 38
years as it is now .. )
Intel, AMD, Cyrix, etc... can all phase out the 32bit chips in a few years
and start pushing 64bit+ machines for home use, you will still have the
users out there that will either not be able to afford to upgrade (32bit
machines will be around for quite some time, and intel 64bit platform will
not be cheap .. especially when they are/were selling xeon's for up to $7000
a piece processor alone)...
There are still locations .. schools, libraries, etc... that still have PC
Jr's, Commodore 64's, Mac Classic's, Apple IIgs's, etc... and look at how
old some of those machines are!
My 2.5c...
