The main point is that we are _only_ talking about gcc 3.4 on i386 - for 
more recent compilers we do not disable unit-at-a-time.
First of all our user - and therefore tester - base with this compiler 
has become quite small. And checkstack alone doesn't help that much with 
finding the problems since it only lists per-function stack usage, not 
the stack usage of the complete call chain.
People who want maximum performance and/or minimum code size anyway 
won't use a more than 3 years old compiler.
If we were talking about gcc 4.2 I would agree with you, but I simply do 
not see the point in risking regressions for gcc 3.4 users when the only 
benefit would be better code with an ancient compiler.
