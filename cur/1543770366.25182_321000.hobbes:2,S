Sven,
Any news of your speech?  I only live 4 and a half hours drive from
Ottawa, and I just got the OK to go (from the wife :-).  I guess the OLS
can get another $500 from me be just letting you speak, even if it's
just a BOFS.  I got a few extra tomatoes rotting in the fridge from last
year that I can bring ;-)
