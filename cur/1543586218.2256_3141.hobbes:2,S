This is definitely not a bug.  Deleting a file (under *nix) does not
"modify" the file at all, it is modifying the directory where the file
resides.  In this case, a user _will_ have permission to write into
their home directory, so they can delete the file, but not modify it.
Why do such a thing?  If you have group/world write permission on a
directory, then people who have write permission to the _directory_
should be able to delete files even if they don't own them.  However,
if you set the "sticky" bit on the directory (chmod +t /dir), then only
the owner of the file can delete it, like in /tmp.
Cheers, Andreas
