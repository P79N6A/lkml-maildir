What extender board is this?  Do you have docs/schematics?
And what motherboard brand/type?

Actually, the IDSEL resistor would be on the computer's
motherboard, not on the PCI board.  And to which address line
the IDSEL line is connected depends on which PCI slot on the
motherboard you're looking at.
A multimeter should do the trick, but I would advise against this
if you're not totally comfortable with hacking hardware.
