No. read_suspend_image/read_pagedir/data_read is image reading. That
does not belong to snaphost. The rest is notthat clear, but I have it
working in userspace.
Image creation is still done in kernel space, but I think that kernel
<-> user interface is going to be cleaner that way, and I do not think
pushing it to user is so huge win.
Yes, names are not ideal, but that will be followup patch.
