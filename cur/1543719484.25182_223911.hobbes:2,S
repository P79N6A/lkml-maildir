In X standard keyboards Meta is mapped as the second symbol for 
Alt.

If you do generate a list of keycode - scancode - meaning pairs 
it will surely make my life easier.
I'm not particularly familiar with xkb configuration either. I 
can *probably* make it work (i.e. test it as functional) on my 
Dell Inspiron 8200 keyboard and on a standard pc104 keyboard 
only. You probably need somebody else to work out the details 
for other keyboards, though.
