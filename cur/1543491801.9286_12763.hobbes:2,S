I know what it was and is used for. I think we have a bug.
As you can see below, Digital UNIX _does_ let a normal user
set the sticky bit on a directory:
$ md bits
$ chmod 7777 bits
$ ls -ld bits
drwsrwsrwt   2 acahalan acahalan     512 Apr  3 06:05 bits
Normal behavior seems to be:
regular file:  only root can set the sticky bit
directory:     anyone can set the sticky bit
symlink:       nobody can set the sticky bit
other:         ???
