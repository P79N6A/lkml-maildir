That's correct. Though at times I'll build a one-off test kernel if I'm
suspicious about something, and push that out as a testing update before
the real update goes live.
Those typically don't get anywhere near the level of exposure as our
development kernels though, so they tend not to show up problems as often.
We also carry the 'check the redzones of non-free slabs every few minutes'
patch, which turned up some things once or twice, but nothing else in
quite a while.
