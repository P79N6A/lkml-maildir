just set the personality with setarch if you don't want randomisation.
Why is it that you can't cope with randomization? You'll have SOME
randomziation no matter what because each glibc compile will have a
slightly different footprint on the stack before your app gets to it,
as do the various environment variables and kernel AT_ variables.
