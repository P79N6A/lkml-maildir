__up is declared 'asmlinkage', which means that conventional
'C' calling convention is used, that eax and/or edx/eax pair
is used for return values and the input values are pushed on
  the stack. The last parameter passed is a pointer in %ecx.
Therefore, the called 'C' function, that 'knows' only about
the first parameter passed, will get the correct pointer value.
The 'C' function also never changes the value of that pointer,
only something that it points to.
Now, wake_up() gets a pointer to the variable sem->wait. wake_up()
never modifies 'sem', only sem->wait.

Very wrong. In fact, it would unbalance the stack. The register
value, %ecx must be restored exactly as the code does it. One
can't assume that %ecx magically got changed and needs to be
'corrected'.
Maybe you meant:
 	pushl	%eax
 	pushl	%edx
 	pushl	%ecx
 	call	__up
 	addl	$0x04, %esp	# Bypass ecx on stack
 	popl	%edx
 	popl	%eax
At least the stack would be correct and the return-address wouldn't
be clobbered. However, now ecx ends up being whatever value some
called 'C' function left it. This will result in a system failure
because previous code expected all registers to be preserved.

It 'taint broke. Don't "fix" it.
