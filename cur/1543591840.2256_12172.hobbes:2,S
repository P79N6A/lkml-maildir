Hi !!
Well, don't warry about this issue any more :-). That's entirely
RedHat's mistake -- they didn't took a look at ./configure --help.
I've done ./configure --with-mmalloc and it does not complin amy more.
However, it still does not work :-))..

unlinked
An internal GDB error was detected.  This may make make further
debugging unreliable.  Continue this debugging session? (y or n) n
Create a core file containing the current state of GDB? (y or n) n

I guess now it's GNU's problems, not yours. Thanks.
