I am going to ask some question in order to learn something about page
coloring (I know nothing about it).
If somebody has some pointer where I can read C code or docs about page
colouring I am very interested.

What does it mean "cache line aliasing"?
And what does it mean that a page is coloured or not?
What is the point of page colouring? Do you want to avoid TLB misses or is
only a L1/L2 cache issue? (or both?)
Reply me only if you have some time to waste of course ;).
Thanks.
