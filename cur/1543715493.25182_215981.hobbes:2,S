It would be nice of you to do so, then issue some
sort of security alert.

If you're suggesting that user-controlled media implies
the ability to boot via that media, you're very wrong.
a. LinuxBIOS
b. OpenFirmware (Mac or Sun) with boot password
c. no floppy, and a Zip drive on BIOS-disabled SCSI
d. parallel port Zip drive
e. FireWire w/o BIOS support

blocked or there is a human nearby that would notice)

Sure, but you shouldn't assume that all admins know
to do this. The default must be secure.

You said "This is the bahavior of Solaris." and I took
that for the truth. Now you say it's tunable. Well, OK
then, so Solaris _doesn't_ have an insecure config as
it comes from Sun? I have no problem with supporting an
insecure config, but you were suggesting that it would
be the new default (and only) behavior.
