When we started out down this road we though we needed to scan linearly
too due to the buddy marking scheme.  Now that we're at this end of the
road we know thats pretty easy to fix, we're already considering merging
the two reclaims anyhow.
Probabally this would do something pretty similar.  It feels at a quick
glance as it its going to have slightly different semantics, but that
may be better or worse.
I'll go try it out and see how it looks.
Thanks for reading.
