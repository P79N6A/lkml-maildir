What you have coded is really an exchange, not a test.  Here is the asm
equivalent of what you coded:
int atomic_xchg(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
	int ret;
	__asm__("xchgl %1,%0"
		: "=m" (v->counter), "=r" (ret)
		: "0" (v->counter), "1" (i));
	return ret;
}

int atomic_xadd(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
	int ret;
	__asm__(LOCK "xaddl %1,%0"
		: "=m" (v->counter), "=r" (ret)
		: "0" (v->counter), "1" (i));
	return ret;
}
This one only works on 486+, but there are practically no real 386 SMP
systems.
