Hi.
Building latest 2.4.1-ac8, I got the following warning (it is harlmess, but
if you want to make the compiler cleanly silent...):
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-f
rame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686
    -c -o names.o names.c
