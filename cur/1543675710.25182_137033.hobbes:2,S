Ok i'll ask him about the details, but i've posted on a number of 
occasions about aic7xxx oopsing unless i boot with noapic. Interrupts do 
get delivered otherwise it wouldn't even get to mounting root. I can't 
give you a 2.5.70 boot because raid is horked there too. If you want me to 
fish out the emails again i can do that.
