Exactly, and that is what the barriers are for.  I like the concept of 
barriers a whole lot.  We should put this interface on a pedestal and really 
dig into how to use it, or even better, how to optimize it.
But for now, as I understand it, a cluster client's view of the cluster world 
is entirely via cman events, which include things like other nodes joining 
and leaving service groups.  (Service groups are another interface we need to 
put on a pedestal, and start working on, because right now it's a clean idea, 
not thought all the way through.)

Heh, I generally think about failing over in less than a second, preferably 
much, much less.  Maybe you just have to scale your heuristic a little?

Gdlm and gfs are well-glued because Dave and Patrick have been working on it 
for years.  Other components barely know about the interfaces, let alone use 
them correctly.  In the end _every component_ of the cluster stack has to do 
the dance correctly on every node.  We've really only just started on that 
path.  Hopefully we'll be able to move down it much more quickly now that the 
code is coming out of the cathedral.
Regards,
Daniel
