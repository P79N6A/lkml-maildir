I am experiencing a weird slowness all 2.1.x and 2.2.0-pre9 kernels with
Apache.   I am running on the following specs:
Slackware 3.5
Dual PII 300mhZ
190 megs memory
SCSI Ultrawide with Baracuda drives
Apache 1.3.3
IP Aliasing and Firewalling enabled.
No IPChains rules set
Apache handling approx 200 connections at any given time.
It seems that after 5 minutes or so that Apache can't accept connections.
It doesn't appear to be on the Apache side, as it is always hungry for more.
I revert back to 2.0.35 and experience no problems of the sort.
Any ideas of what to do?
Gavin
