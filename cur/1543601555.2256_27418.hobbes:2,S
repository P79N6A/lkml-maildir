I am just opposing to be forced to use a fix when a fix isn't really
needed on my setup.

I will, and if I find something done not needed I might complain again.

I dont suppose it will take more than an hour for somebody to notice that
under the "Optimized for K7" option there is another called "Enable 55.7=0
fix for K7 that oops all over the place"
Please calm down. I never suggested your fix is wrong. It was a long
awaited one indeed. I only suggested that it be applied wherever it needs
to be, not blindly whenever a KT133/A setup is seen.
If you don't agree with my view, just say why, don't go arround mocking me
about it.
-K.
