The kernel only exports information, which you can get from sysfs. This 
will unlikely become a requirement for 2.6, so how this done can still 
change a bit.

Early-userspace is not that much of a problem, as it only has to map 
the device information from sysfs to a device name. The required 
configuration file can be quite simple, every device has a list of 
properties, which closely resembles sysfs (one property == one value).
bye, Roman
