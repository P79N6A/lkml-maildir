Not really. We want to get the I/O done and we don't want
to wait until the queue fills up.

OOM is not the normal state the system is in. You really want
kswapd to do some work in the background (allowing user programs
to allocate their bits of memory without stalling).

In the OOM case we'll have to kill a process. Stalling the
system forever is not a solution.

It does make sense in reality. Please read the explanation
I sent with the patch. I agree that somewhere halfway
freepages.low and freepages.min would be better, but there
is no need to complicate the calculation...

If kswapd can keep up, there's no need at all to slow down
processes, not even hogs. If kswapd can't keep up then we'll
start stalling processes (just 5 allocations further away,
_and_ kswapd will have been started by that time and have had
the time to do something).

I consider the absense of the third boundary a HUGE bug
in current 2.2 VM. You need three boundaries:
- min:  below this boundary only ATOMIC (and GFP_HIGH?)
        allocations can be done
- low:  below this boundary we start swapping agressively
- high: below this boundary we start background swapping
        (once a second, without impact on processes), above
        this boundary we stop swapping
Current (2-border) code makes for bursty swap behaviour,
poor handling of kernel allocations (see the complaints
Alan got about systems which ran OOM on atomic allocations).
There is a good reason why there is a difference between
background swapping and agressive swapping, why there is
a separate swapout daemon, etc...
Performance-wise, current 2.2 went back to the stone age,
we should do something about that.

That's not the way things were meant to be. Below freepages.low
low-priority allocations should stall, below freepages.min higher
priority allocations should stall and only GFP_ATOMIC and
PF_MEMALLOC allocations should be able to proceed.
