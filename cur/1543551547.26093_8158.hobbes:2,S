Thanks Allen, you're exactly right.  I'm charged with the task of finding
lots of nasties like that in our old code base where a number of things
were just hacked in down and dirty.  Our embeded environment moved from
XINU on an SH2/SH3 with no mmu support and a BSD protocol stack we hacked
in ourselves to Linux kernel, MIPS, and mmu.  Codeing standards truely
have had to step up a couple levels due to the growing complexity of the
environment, but eventually it will be worth the pain.
