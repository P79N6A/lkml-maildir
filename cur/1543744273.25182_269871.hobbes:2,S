Stefan,
Can you try the following patch, please? It is diffed against 2.6.10-rc1,
but I think it should apply to -mm kernels as well.
Basically 2.6.8 and earlier kernels had some quirks in the page allocator
that would allow for example, a large portion of "DMA" memory to be reserved
for network memory allocations (atomic allocations). After 'fixing' this
problem, 2.6.9 is effectively left with about a quarter the amount of memory
reserved for network allocations compared with 2.6.8.
The following patch roughly restores parity there. Thanks.
Nick
