It sounds like you need to set the network card irq to be non-threaded. 
What is the output of:
root@mindpipe:/home/rlrevell/kernel-source/linux-2.6.8.1-P3# find
/proc/irq/ -name threaded -print -a -exec cat {} \;
/proc/irq/15/ide1/threaded
1
/proc/irq/14/ide0/threaded

/proc/irq/12/uhci_hcd/threaded

/proc/irq/11/eth0/threaded

/proc/irq/11/uhci_hcd/threaded

/proc/irq/10/EMU10K1/threaded

You probably want all of these to be 1 except ethX.
