David, you can use the KMSGDUMP tool I developped for
this a while ago. Compile your kernel with it compiled
in and you can automatically dump all your messages
on a diskette previously inserted in the drive on a
kernel panic. You can also get into a simple text
interface in which you can scroll your messages, and
decide to dump them or print them via the parallel
port.
Please consult

for more info.
Since it raises only under weird circumstances (or
Alr+SysRq+d), you may experience difficulties to dump
your messages if the kernel is really stuck. I'm
working on a new release which does most of the job
at kernel startup. In this case, even a CPU reset or
triple fault could be enough to get all the messages.
Willy
