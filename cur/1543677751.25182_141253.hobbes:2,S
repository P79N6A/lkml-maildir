The system now uses the posix clock_monotonic clock to compute uptime. 
  This clock requires that the arch code (do_settime) keep track of 
time settings and back them out of "wall_to_monotonic".
There was also a recent change to set wall_to_monotonic to -(xtime) so 
that this clock would be 0 at boot time.  This is usually done in the 
arch/kernel/time.c code where xtime (i.e. the system time) is set 
during boot up.  Prior code set it to the initial jiffies value.  I 
suspect that this change did not get into your kernel.
