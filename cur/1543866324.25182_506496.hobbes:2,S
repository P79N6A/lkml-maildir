Sorry about my silence for now three months.
Been overly busy and with family now extended to three kids takes time too.
I will be back in a months time - maybe a bit sooner.
As for the Kbuild area I usual have patches cooking in -mm for a while
before pushing to you - comments are usual few when I post patches
which I take as a sign that most people do not care about Kbuild
as long as it works, other are not into the makefile trickery,
and also that the patches are small logical steps (which is
true for all contributions and not just mine).
