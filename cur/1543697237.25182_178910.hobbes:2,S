Hello,
I recently put up 2 intel network adapters:
00:09.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) (rev 01)
00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) (rev 01)
( I replaced some Intel PRO1000 Desktop which I had before ) and now
I get serious problems with the hda disk:
Nov 19 12:42:28 firelog2 kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0x82 { Busy }
Nov 19 12:42:28 firelog2 kernel:
Nov 19 12:42:28 firelog2 kernel: hda: DMA disabled
Nov 19 12:42:28 firelog2 kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Nov 19 12:42:33 firelog2 kernel: ide0: reset: success
Nov 19 12:43:53 firelog2 kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
Nov 19 12:43:53 firelog2 kernel:
Nov 19 12:43:53 firelog2 kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Nov 19 12:43:54 firelog2 kernel: ide0: reset: success
Nov 19 12:46:19 firelog2 kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
Nov 19 12:46:19 firelog2 kernel:
Nov 19 12:46:19 firelog2 kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Nov 19 12:46:19 firelog2 kernel: ide0: reset: success
From time to time I cannot even boot the system ( even the e1000 module
is not loaded )
The kernel version is 2.4.22 and the intel driver version is : 5.2.20
( I was using the same intel driver and the same kernel version before with
Intel PRO1000 Desktop adapter )
Can anybody help me track down this? to see if it's something hardware related,
only software... is it DMA related?
Teo
