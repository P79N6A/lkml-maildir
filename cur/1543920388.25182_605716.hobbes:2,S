I guess this would avoid race conditions within the set_cpus_allowed()
routine, between its code to read the cpu_online_map and set the tasks
cpus_allowed ... though if that's useful, don't we really need to add
locking/unlocking on sched_hotcpu_mutex right inside the
set_cpus_allowed() routine, for all users of set_cpus_allowed ??
But I don't see where the above code helps at all deal with the
races I considered in my previous message:

These races involve reading the tasks cpuset cpus_allowed mask, reading
the online map, and both reading and writing the tasks task_struct
cpus_allowed.  Unless one holds the relevant lock for the entire
interval surrounding the critical accesses to these values, it won't do
any good that I can see.  Just briefly holding a lock around each
separate access is useless.
