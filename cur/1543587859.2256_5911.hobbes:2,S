Thanks also for that answer, here are the one I got from several people:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
^o:set paste
[paste stuff]
^o:set nopaste
Or you could ^[ back to cmd mode first..  I find ^o more useful for a
quick set change like that though.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hint: use shift+v to mark the lines, then gc to format the text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hint: type ':set paste' before pasting and ':set nopaste' after pasting.

Yes, at most under 2.4.3 ;-)

Well, I think there are some change in usb:
[greg@localhost kernel]$ foreach x ( patch-2.4.3-ac*-ac* )
foreach? echo $x
foreach? bzcat $x |grep -i usb|wc -l
foreach? end
patch-2.4.3-ac1-ac2.bz2
    132
patch-2.4.3-ac2-ac3.bz2
      6
patch-2.4.3-ac3-ac4.bz2
     12
patch-2.4.3-ac4-ac5.bz2
    160
patch-2.4.3-ac5-ac6.bz2
      0
patch-2.4.3-ac6-ac7.bz2
     14
(Notice the good paste)
None of those seems to change things in usb-uhci
Thanks for all your help (and all the answer concerning vim, I haven't
yet replyed to two, because they are PGP signed and I still have problem
with PGP with mutt...), it's time for 
http://www.linux-usb.org
 ;-))
