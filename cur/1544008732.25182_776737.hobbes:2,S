I think that zero is invalid for all the parameters.
Setting max_phys_segments to zero means that we can't do any data
transfer... Ditto for max_hw_segments, and max_segment_size.
I think that the lowest layer (scsi in this case) needs to setup them
properly and the upper layers should inherit them.

Yeah, the patch is fine for now.
