           Summary: cs46xx driver mmap_valid 0-->1 in kernel 2.6.x?
    Kernel Version: 2.6.x
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: drivers_sound@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
         Submitter: jaba@mikrobitti.fi
Distribution: Gentoo Linux
Hardware Environment: Asus A7V133, AMD Athlon
Software Environment: Gentoo Linux 1.4, default-x86-1.4, gcc-3.3.2,
glibc-2.3.3_pre20040117-r0, 2.6.2-rc1-mm2
Problem Description: This problem has been bothering me all over the kernel
2.6.x. I don't know if any other applications are affected by this bug, but a
game called Enemy Territory surely is.
With the default kernel 2.6 cs46xx driver (with "new DSP support" enabled) the
sound in Enemy Territory doesn't work at all, complaining "unable to mmap
/dev/dsp" during the ET startup. But if I do the patch below to cs46xx.c, sound
starts to work.
The patch I've used:
---
--- cs46xx_old.c        2004-01-27 14:09:46.625277768 +0200
+++ cs46xx.c    2004-01-27 12:32:28.000000000 +0200
@@ -54 +54 @@
-static int mmap_valid[SNDRV_CARDS] = {[0 ... (SNDRV_CARDS - 1)] = 0};
+static int mmap_valid[SNDRV_CARDS] = {[0 ... (SNDRV_CARDS - 1)] = 1};
---
Is there a reason to keep mmap_valid=0 in cs46xx driver or is this a real bug? I
haven't seen any new bugs with this patch applied, all the multimedia
applications (mplayer, xine, xmms, noatun) keeps on working.
