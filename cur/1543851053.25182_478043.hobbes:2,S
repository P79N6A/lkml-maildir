cpusets has a neat flag called notify_on_release. If set, some userspace
agent is invoked when the last task exists from a cpuset.
Can't we use a similar flag as a configfs file and (if set) invoke a
userspace agent (to cleanup) upon last reference drop? How would this
violate logic of configfs?

One flexibility configfs (and any fs-based interface) offers is, as Matt
had pointed out sometime back, the ability to delage management of a
sub-tree to a particular user (without requiring root permission).
For ex:
			/
			|
		 -----------------
		|		  |
	       vatsa (70%)	linux (20%)
		|
	 ----------------------------------
	|	         | 	          |
      browser (10%)   compile (50%)    editor (10%)
In this, group 'vatsa' has been alloted 70% share of cpu. Also user
'vatsa' has been given permissions to manage this share as he wants. If
the cpu controller supports hierarchy, user 'vatsa' can create further
sub-groups (browser, compile ..etc) -without- requiring root access.
Also it is convenient to manipulate resource hierarchy/parameters thr a
shell-script if it is fs-based.

Ideally we should have one interface - either syscall or configfs - and
not both.
Assuming your requirement of auto-deleting objects in configfs can be
met thr' something similar to cpuset's notify_on_release, what other
killer problem do you think configfs will pose?

Sorry dont get you here. Are you saying we should support different
grouping for different controllers?

It can be a significant pain for some workloads. I have heard that
workload management products often encounter processes with anywhere
between 200-700 threads in a process. Moving all those threads one by
one from user-space can suck.
