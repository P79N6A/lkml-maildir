Hi Joel,
Here is a revised version of the patchset making lockdep happy with configfs.
I still don't have a good setup to test the second patch beyond compilation, and
I still guess that you have one :)
Louis
Changelog:
- put s_depth logic in separate functions and remove #ifdef LOCKDEP in the
  hooked functions.
- added the following note to explain why configfs_depend_prep() is correct
  when examining attaching items:
+ * Note: items in the middle of attachment start with s_type = 0
+ * (configfs_new_dirent()), and configfs_make_dirent() (called from
+ * create_dir()) sets s_type = CONFIGFS_DIR|CONFIGFS_USET_CREATING. In both
+ * cases the item is ignored. Since s_type is an int, we rely on the CPU to
+ * atomically update the value, without making configfs_make_dirent() take
+ * configfs_dirent_lock.
- fixed parenthesis on pattern !a & b && c --> !(a & b) && c
- quiet checkpatch
