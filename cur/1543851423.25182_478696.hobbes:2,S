Promise has given me permission to post hardware programming info for 
one of their chips (Linux driver: sata_promise), PDC20319.  This also 
marks the first open chipset for Promise (AFAIK), so let's give them a 
round of applause.
The PDC20319 is a reasonably representative example of the hardware 
programming interface covered by sata_promise.  Kernel developers 
wishing to work on sata_promise can study this doc, and deduce how the 
two-port PDC2037x chips work.
In addition to describing the "packet" format for ATA and ATAPI 
commands, this doc also describes how to use the chip's XOR RAID-assist 
features.  I think it would be cool if someone so motivated found a way 
to use this efficiently under Linux.
The doc:

I have also updated the list open chipsets and developer resources on 
linux-ata.org:

Have fun!
