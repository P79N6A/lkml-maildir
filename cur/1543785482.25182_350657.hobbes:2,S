Yes, and they're in this series.  This patch does:
drivers/ide/pci/hpt366.c
And patch 10/11 does:
drivers/ide/pci/cmd64x.c
drivers/ide/pci/hpt34x.c
Additionally, the sungem (5/11) and sunhme (6/11) changes are fallout
from PCI_ROM fixes.
I believe the remainder of the PCI_ROM related patches were primarily
for consistency.
thanks,
