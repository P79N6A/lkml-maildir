Well, I'm afraid that full image of memory is not that high on
priority list. Rafael's solution seems to work pretty much okay.

Well, sorry about that. I thought I gave you fair warning at the end
of last year, when I posted uswsusp patches to the lists...

Well, you did some pretty amazing work with suspend2.net community...

We could use some help with userland tools. Helping with userland
parts is probably the fastest way to get usable/nice/fast suspend to
the users.
If you think suspend2 can be easily ported to userspace... yes, that
