I'll definitely take a look. So far it seems that extending cpu_isolated_map
is more natural way of propagating this notion to the rest of the kernel.
Since it's very similar to the cpu_online_map concept and it's easy to integrated
with the code that already uses it. 
Anyway. I'll take a look at the cpuset flag that you mentioned and report back.
Thanx
