It should be easy enough to put that declaration on an architecture
you can build and check that way.
Multiple declaration of a variable with only one having an initializer
work because the variable gets put into the common section as I recall.
I don't believe this is portable to all C implementations. but the
important question is does this construct work in the kernel.
If it doesn't work as is we should be able to get similar behavior
from weak symbols.
Could you test that part of your patch please?
