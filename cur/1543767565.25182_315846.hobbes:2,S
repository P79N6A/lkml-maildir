  I've looked through your dumps and I spotted where is the problem -
it's our well known and beloved lock inversion between PageLock and
transaction start (giving CC to Badari who's the author of the patch
that introduced it AFAIK).
  The correct order is: first get PageLock and *then* start transaction.
But in ext3_writeback_writepages() first ext3_journal_start() is called
and then __mpage_writepages is called that tries to do LockPage and
deadlock is there. Badari, could you please fix that (sadly I think that
would not be easy)? Maybe we should back out those changes until it gets
fixed...
