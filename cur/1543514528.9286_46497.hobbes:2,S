Wouldn't something like:
	struct ei_device *ei_local = (struct ei_device *) NULL;
	ei_local = (struct ei_device *) dev->priv;
eliminate the warning in all cases?
I am certainly not an expert with C, but since the variable would then
used somewhere other then the definition it should remove the warning
without adding any more preprocessor stuff, and not break the other
architechures.
I am sure I will be corrected if I am wrong.  :)
