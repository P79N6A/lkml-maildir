XFS needs 2.5, not 2.4, because of a lot of reasons.
If I do remember well a strong obiection to XFS is that it introduces a
kernel thread to emulate Irix behavious to talk with pagebuf (a la Irix),
end to have an interface with VM and Block Device layer.
This forces some vincles.
It is a lot of time that I do not try XFS, so maybe things changed, but
XFS has has data block of the same size of memory pages (4 or 8 Kb
depending on architecture), not that I have some remak about that, but I
use XFS on Irix on an Origin 2000 with a couple of TB disk space, it is
another thing in front of Linux ports.
On the other side delayed allocation is quite cool ;)

Every FS has its strenght points and its weackness.
For example on MC^2 I found reiserFS on LVM to have a really good
interaction with the way MC^2 works, expecially because
I have a lot of small|medium sized files, I suppose.
I also tied XFS and JFS on MC^2, and maybe with other file size
and I/O loads they would be better. I just talk for my systems needs.
(all test were with latest 2.4 kernels, a month ago.
I cannot risk corruption on this
storage system, so 2.5 is not for me there :( ).
