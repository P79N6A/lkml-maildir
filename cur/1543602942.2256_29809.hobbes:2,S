Greetings from the 2001 Linux Devel meeting in Oldenburg!
Roman Zippel looked at my driver and added code to print the usage 
counter for each page after a 9-order __get_free_pages().
We found that only the first (!) page has a count of 1, the others have 0!
That would cover my impression, that only the 1st page is really mine...
Roman found that strange and added this:
          struct page * page = virt_to_page(card_ptr->dma_blk1[n]);
          int i;
          for(i = 0; i < (1 << max_order); i++, page++)
          {
            atomic_set(&page->count, 1);
          }
And the freeing of the pages is now done page by page in the _vma_close()
function.
I will now test the version but I have only a 1-CPU box here. On an SMP Box I
could imagine that even between __get_free_pages() and the
atomic_set(&page->count, 1) someone else already uses my pages.
Could you please comment on this?
Thanks,
