Environment variables are a part of the API that Unix supplies to
userspace programs.  The kernel is not a userspace program, and as far
as I know it doesn't even do most of the work of maintaining the
environment for a process--that's done by the C library and the
userspace program loader.

No, probably because it's such an obvious concept.  You might get hold
of one of the several books on Linux kernel programming and see if
they mention it.
If someone is insisting you use environment varaiables in kernel code,
challenge them to show you where they are implemented in the kernel.  :)
