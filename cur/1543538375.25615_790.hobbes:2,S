Yes, but not in thes case ;)
You have to drop privileges after calling bind, then the owner of 
the socket is set.
The only thing an application can do right now is do a setfsuid, right?
That solves the 'problem' right now. It could call setfsuid before 
socket and bind. inet_bind goes for the euid in capaple, not the fsuid. 
It's not pretty, but what the heck.
Thank you for the patient answers.
