For what definition of "everything"?  I'm not being facetious, I think
it's a fundamentally impossible statement to make, especially if the
bootloader is interactive.

Your intermediate Linux still needs to have all its devices.  I was
working for a while on a project to create an "intermediate Linux" which
wouldn't claim to own the world but instead callback to the firmware; this
would be a port of Linux to a sort of pseudo-architecture.  I got a bit
too busy, but I think it's a valid program.

PXE is there on the vast majority of all modern (1999 or later) network
cards.  Those that aren't either have a socket or don't have any
provisions for network firmware whatsoever, as a rule.

We could have, but we didn't.  I DO NOT want to launch a competing spec.

Yes, but we're several years too late.  PXE is the accepted spec, for as
much as it sucks (to its defense, the latest version of the PXE spec
actually does most of what you want it to be able to do, although few if
any commercial PXE specs implement these correctly to my experience.
I would *LOVE* to see a high-quality Open Source PXE implementation, for
several reasons:
a) To support older, socket-carrying network cards;
b) To put on a floppy or flash into your network ROM if your commercial
PXE firmware is too broken to live.

There are a lot of things that are "by no means necessary" if you look at
any one individual user.
It's fundamentally about creating pervasive interfaces.  My problem with
several of your proposals is that they make well-established interfaces
*less* pervasisve, which is a huge step in the wrong direction.
