Subject: [PATCH] VFS: turn off FL_SLEEP when calling do_vfs_lock() just in case and get rid of "VFS is out of sync with lock manager" messages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/15/53

Convert "VFS is out of sync with lock manager!" printk() in
do_vfs_lock() to dprintk() since the message is useless in normal use
but could possibly be useful as a debugging aid.
Also turn off FL_SLEEP when calling do_vfs_lock() just in case, after
getting -EINTR or -ERESTARTSYS.
Patch has been tested on a production webserver and works just fine.
