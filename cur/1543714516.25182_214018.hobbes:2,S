Here's this drive benchmarks under Windows on almost the same SATA controller:
http://www.tomshardware.com/storage/20040123/wd740-01.html
actual numbers:

It appears to be the fastest SATA drive up to the moment, I expected to get 
something around 60-70 MB/sec

I tried 2.4.25. There is no sata_sil driver there. siimage driver detects the 
controller but doesn't detect the disk:
SiI3112 Serial ATA: IDE controller at PCI slot 00:0f.0
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:0f.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 12 with 00:0a.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 12 with 00:10.2
SiI3112 Serial ATA: chipset revision 2
SiI3112 Serial ATA: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: MMIO-DMA , BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
    ide3: MMIO-DMA , BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
that's all
