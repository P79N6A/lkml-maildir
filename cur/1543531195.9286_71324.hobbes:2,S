What do you mean by trying to DMA without autodma?
I'm using an ASUS P2B-DS (PIIX4 tuning and all enabled in kernel config)
with two Celerons.  128MB ECC SDRAM.  Three WD hard drives are attached:
hda: WDC WD273BA, 26105MB w/1961kB Cache, CHS=3328/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: WDC WD273BA, 26105MB w/1961kB Cache, CHS=3328/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdc: WDC AC28400R, 8063MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=16383/16/63, UDMA(33)
The first two are UDMA/66 drives, but everything is plugged into the
UDMA/33 on-board controller.
Not using "hdparm" at all after boot still shows the the same problems.
The case where the problem shows up more with PIO mode looks just like
the previous problem with the elevator changes -- the timing and/or
slower I/O made it show up more easily... I don't think it has anything
to do with incorrect settings (although I may be wrong)...
