I think Ogawa's patch is the right solution for dropping the triple
read, which should help a good bit. 
If you *really* are sure the TSC is usable on your system, you can
override it w/ clock=tsc. Warning users that the clock is slow without
giving them a way to know if the TSC is usable will likely just cause
more problem reports. And hey, its better then using the PIT :)
