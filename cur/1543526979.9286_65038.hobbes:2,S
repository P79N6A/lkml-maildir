Hi,
You still didn't tell us WHY you are interested in
fast booting.  Not that I'm against it, but it's
only critical to me if I'm rebooting often,
or if I'm running a server or something like a
set-top box, where down-time is critical, which
you didn't say.

Also, Werner wrote:
Everything that goes into the EBDA (Extended BIOS Data Area, the stuff
allocated below 0xA000:0000), e.g. certain SMP tables (not sure what
they do - I just know that it kills SMP if LILO trips over them ;-)
Where can I find docs on the EBDA?
Thanks,
Randy
