You can alyo cat a big file into /dev/null. I made those examples in order 
to demonstrate the problem with using O_DIRECT.
OTOH, I don't realtime stuff on my computer, so I'm not really affected, 
but I'll try to show it anyway.

Just a q&d test:
$ time ls -l $DIR > /dev/null
real    0m0.442s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.024s
$ time ls -l $DIR > /dev/null
real    0m0.077s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.008s
cat $BIGFILES_1.5GB > /Dev/null
$ time ls -l $DIR > /dev/null
real    0m0.270s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.008s
$ time ls -l $DIR > /dev/null
real    0m0.078s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.004s
BTW:
I suggested the random eviction because it will evict pages from large 
files more likely than pages from small files, but I now think it will 
cause the evicted pages to be non-continuous, too, and thereby cause 
rereading them to be slower. I don't know which effect would be worse.
