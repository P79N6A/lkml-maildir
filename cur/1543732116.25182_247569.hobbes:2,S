I hope this is not a stupid idea:
I propose a finer-grained approach to suid-root binaries. Perhaps, 
instead of having a single flag giving the binary all the rights and 
responsibilities of its owner, there could be a table/list/something of 
capabilities which we want to grant to the binary. This, of course, 
would be a privileged operation (perhaps a new capability?).
For example, we might want to grant cdrecord CAP_SYS_RAWIO. This way, we 
don't have to worry about cdrecord running as root and not dropping all 
the capabilities it doesn't need, by accident or by malice.
Further, and I realize that this would probably require major 
restructuring, perhaps there could be another field: for each capability 
we want to grant, a method to specify _where_ the binary can use that 
capability.
To extend the previous example: we might want to give cdrecord 
CAP_SYS_RAWIO just on, say, /dev/burner0 and /dev/burner1, but not 
/dev/hda. That way, some typo won't have us trying to burn cds with our 
hard disks.
Again, I hope it's not a stupid idea. I don't have a working 
implementation, and I'm not even sure if it's even possible, but it's a 
thought.
