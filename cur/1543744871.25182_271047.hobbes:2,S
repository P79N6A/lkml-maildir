Greetings;
Board is a Biostar N7-NCD-Pro, Athlon 2800XP mounted, gig of ram.
Booting to 2.6.10-rc2 just now, I see that the dmesg log shows this:
PCI: Using ACPI for IRQ routing
** PCI interrupts are no longer routed automatically.  If this
** causes a device to stop working, it is probably because the
** driver failed to call pci_enable_device().  As a temporary
** workaround, the "pci=routeirq" argument restores the old
** behavior.  If this argument makes the device work again,
** please email the output of "lspci" to bjorn.helgaas@hp.com
** so I can fix the driver.
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.

Nov 15 00:35:40 coyote alsasound: Starting sound driver: snd-intel8x0
Nov 15 00:35:40 coyote kernel: ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LACI] enabled at IRQ 12
Nov 15 00:35:40 coyote kernel: ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:06.0[A] -> GSI 12 (level, low) -> IRQ 12

So there seems to be some confusion re the use of IRQ 12
Also during the early boot when its running on a vga 80x25 screen,
there are no fonts, just the occassional flicker of the curser
as it moves back and forth across the bottom of the screen, so
my early boot, after about 10 lines at the initiation, is invisible.
Later on it switches to an 80x30 screen, at which point I can
see the rest of the boot proceedure.  What causes this?
