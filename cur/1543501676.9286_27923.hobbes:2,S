This is a bit off on an tangent, but I'm in the process of porting the 
user-mode kernel up to 2.3.  This will make the development and running of an 
automated test suite easier.  I'd particularly like to see a coverage suite 
for the kernel.  With a test coverage analyzer and the user-mode kernel, this 
ought to be possible.  This kind of test suite would take effort to maintain, 
but there are are lot more people out there able to do this kind of thing than 
there are able to do kernel development.
