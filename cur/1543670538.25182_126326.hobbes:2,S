If 10% of the disk is bad, I wouldn't continue using it.

Modern disks generally do this kind of thing themselves.  By the time
a disk actually reports write errors, I wouldn't want to continue
using it.  Preferably, I want to know _before_ then, generally by
using S.M.A.R.T. data.

The problem you are describing doesn't really exist in a lot of
cases.  Modern hard disks do not have fixed areas corresponding to
specific blocks - they allocate the available space to blocks as
required.  The disk will just allocate a different area to hold the
block that was originally on the defective part of the media when that
block is re-written.
