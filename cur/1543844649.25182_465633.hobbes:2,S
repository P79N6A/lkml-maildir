So your 2.6.17 kernel *is* modified :)

I maintain the Gentoo kernel and yes we do include sky2 changes, 
sometimes before they make it to Linus for whatever reason, but always 
only if they are in the netdev tree.
If you had switched from gentoo-sources-2.6.17 to gentoo-sources-2.6.18 
you would not have noticed any loss of functionality since the patches 
are obviously carried across. The difference appears to be that you went 
from gentoo-2.6.17 to vanilla-2.6.18...
