As long as you care about being able to tell which is which, yes.  I
can understand why, under some circumstances, this might be taken as
worse than not being able to use code under GPLv3 (or any other
incompatible license) at all.

If it's a mingled combination of code under GPLv2 plus permission to
combine with v3, and GPLv3 plus (potential built-in?) permission to
combine with v2, these are the combined terms.  You can still use it
with code under GPLv2 plus permission to combine with v3, and with
GPLv3 plus (potential built-in?) permission to combine with v2.  I can
see that it boggles the minds not used to this kind of combination.
