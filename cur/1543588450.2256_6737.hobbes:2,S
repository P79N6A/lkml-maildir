I suppose so.  It is pretty paranoid, because of autofs4's extra reference it
can't (shouldn't) ever drop to zero until the filesystem allows it to drop to
zero.  In other words, if it helps, it's hiding another bug.  But you're right,
if this were a general routine, it should definitely return with an elevated
count.

Looks fine to me.  I'll give it a spin.
