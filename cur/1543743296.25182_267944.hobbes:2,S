I'm just curious about why there seems to be so much work going into 
supporting a wide range of GCC versions.  If people are willing to 
download and compile a new kernel (and migrating from 2.4 to 2.6 is 
non-trivial for some systems, like RH9), why aren't they willing to also 
download and build a new compiler?
