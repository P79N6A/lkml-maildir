Hi :)
  And that's exactly what I did :)...  I found that ONLY the combination
of USE_3DNOW and forcing the athlon mmx stuff in (by doing #if 1 in
mmx.c)
results in this wackiness.  I should alos repeat that I *DO* see that
wierdness you described with 3DNOW (in my case, it was that kde locks
up when i try to do something).
 This is damn weird... Who thought channging motherboards would result
in this?
  The other thing i was gunna try is to dump my chipset registers using 
WPCREDIT and WPCRSET and compare them with other people on this list
who have been having the problem.  Maybe our BIOS'es are not
initting/are initting something they should/should not be :).  It this
point, I haven't ruled anything out...
