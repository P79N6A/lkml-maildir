I am not. My MTU is 1500. At the moment the error message is:
  TDH                  <0>
  TDT                  <3>
  next_to_use          <3>
  next_to_clean        <0>
buffer_info[next_to_clean]
  dma                  <128d61202>
  time_stamp           <100026052>
  next_to_watch        <0>
  jiffies              <10002667c>
  next_to_watch.status <0>
I can't reproduce the 2000 value.
PS: The problem does not occur with Knoppix 3.9.
Thanks for the help,
