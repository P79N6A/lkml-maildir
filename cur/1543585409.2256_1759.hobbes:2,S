When you see something like this, please do
	gdb vmlinux
	(gdb) x/10i 0xc021e29a
and it will basically show you where the code jumps back to.
It's almost certainly the beginning of swap_out_mm() where we get the
page_table_lock, but it would still be good to verify.
The deadlock implies that somebody scheduled with page_table_lock held.
Which would be really bad. You should be able to do something like
	if (current->mm && spin_is_locked(&current->mm->page_table_lock))
		BUG():
in the scheduler to see if it triggers (this only works on UP hardware
with a SMP kernel - on a real SMP machine it's entirely legal to have the
lock during a schedule, as the lock may be held by any of the _other_
CPU's, of course, and the above assert would be the wrong thing to do in
general)
Of course, it might not be somebody scheduling with a spinlock, it might
just be a recursive lock bug, but that sounds really unlikely.

it won't do the page table locking for page table allocations, so it will
have other bugs, though.
