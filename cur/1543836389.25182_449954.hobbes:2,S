The tg3 driver is not the only device in the world that requires a
timer based "ping" to work.  The watchdog drivers and the softlockup
detector are other instances which require a timer to not be delayed
an unreasonable amount of time.
Therefore TG3 is not unique in this regard, and I thus don't think
it's worthwhile to change tg3 just to accomodate this broken behavior
of the RT patches.
