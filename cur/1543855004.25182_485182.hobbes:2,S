Right, I currently port that part of SUSE's sysconfig's per-device
configuration to udev, and udev-rules will be able to specify what
driver to use for a device, including driver-unbinding/binding.
Also modprobe will be built into udev to solve the
performance-problems we see with parsing the modprobe-files for every
device with a modalias.
