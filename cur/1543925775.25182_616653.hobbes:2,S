I think it's a matter of issuing a hypercall for reading the clock
address. It's fair simple, and can be done in a later version of this patch.
As for writting, the register hypercall itself can be used. It has no
special side-effects we should care about.

No special preference. It just sounded exity enough to me. I can move to
where you suggest.
