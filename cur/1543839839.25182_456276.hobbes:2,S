Precisely.
Guys, this unwinder change has been quite problematic.  We really cannot
let this badness out into 2.6.18 - it degrades our ability to debug every
subsystem in the entire kernel.  Would marking it CONFIG_BROKEN get us back
to 2.6.17 behaviour?
Has anyone even tried to reproduce Bruce's crash?

argh, ide-scsi.  That driver's main use nowadays is for testing the
oops-handling code.  Please share .config, machine description and compiler
versiom.
