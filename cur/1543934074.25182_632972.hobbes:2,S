Here's one blatantly untested idea I have.  The idea is to keep track if
anyone might be writing to a mnt.  We keep track on a flag in the mnt.
When we set the flag, we increment a counter in the sb and decrement
when the flag is cleared.
We can't simply look at mnt->__mnt_writers because there might be
"checked-out" writers in the mnt_writers[] array.  We also have to keep
new writers from coming in while we do this, so we use the spinlocks in
the mnt_writers[] array for exclusion.  This is a pretty heavyweight
lock, but it only gets used at rw->ro transitions.
