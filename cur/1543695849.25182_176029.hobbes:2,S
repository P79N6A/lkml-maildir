Supporting something as part of the hardware/protocol design is one thing.
Writing the device driver to support it is another (I'm sure that *before* you crash,
you have to set bits in the appropriate OHCI structures).
Actually allowing it to be enabled is a third thing.
Having said that, it *would* make for an interesting kgdb enhancement. :)
