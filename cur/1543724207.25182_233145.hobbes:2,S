The usual case is that a hardware interrupt occurs, gets dispatched
by the kernel to the interrupt service routine, and is quickly
executed without interruption.
If you don't design your interrupt service code to be interrupted,
it won't be interrupted. However, another CPU may be executing
so you need to protect critical sections of code, including
your ISR, with spin-locks.
If you design your ISR to be interrupted, generally it will because,
especially on a network, there is always something that needs
interrupt service. There are so-called bottom-half handlers that
can be dispatched by your ISR to finish up what could be done
with interrupts enabled.
If your ADC board requires periodic service at a regular
interval as many do, (perhaps for an IIR filter) you might
think about writing code that executes on a timer queue,
rather than an interrupt.
