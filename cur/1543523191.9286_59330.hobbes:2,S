Okay, thanks. With the newest ksymoops these warnings are gone.

I grabbed the newest but these warnings persisted:
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module es1370 is in lsmod but not in ksyms,
probably no symbols exported
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module i2c-piix4 is in lsmod but not in
ksyms, probably no symbols exported
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module reiserfs is in lsmod but not in
ksyms, probably no symbols exported
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module smbfs is in lsmod but not in ksyms,
probably no symbols exported
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module w83781d is in lsmod but not in
ksyms, probably no symbols exported
Doesn't that mean that lsmod lists those (as it certainly does), but
there are no symbols present for them in /proc/ksyms? Browsing the
ksymoops docs, I gather that modules that do not export any symbols are
not listed at all by ksymoops. In /proc/ksyms there where no lines for the
above modules, as there were for others.
Anyway, I'm making this wild assumption that while es1370 and smbfs are
the most interesting modules (and not in the ksymoops listing) it is not
likely that the address C5D28000 would be in one of their symbols. Or is
it just coinsidence that all the symbols of the kernel modules start with
c8a (from c8a5b04c to c8a909a4)?
