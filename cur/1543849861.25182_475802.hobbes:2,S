I'm getting this error on with linux 2.6.19-rc2 with tg3 module, even
with patching to v3.66 ...
tg3.c:v3.67 (October 18, 2006)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:00.0[A] -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
tg3: Cannot find proper PCI device base address, aborting.
ACPI: PCI Interrupt for device 0000:02:00.0 disabled
The last version 2.6.18-rc2 works fine.
Jeff.
