On vanilla 2.4.17, 2.4.18, and 2.4.19-pre8, I'm seeing 
some mighty strange khttpd behavior.
It's chewing CPU time, failing in mysterious ways under light
or no load, and oopsing easily.
I'm compiling a writeup at
http://www.kegel.com/linux/khttpd/
and it just keeps getting worse.  It looks like you have
to 1) turn on sloppymime, 2) never restart it, and 3) run
with only 1 thread to have any hope of stability -- and
even then, abruptly terminating client connections causes
an oops fairly frequently.
If I didn't need it for a demo this week (don't ask), I
wouldn't be messing with khttpd; I'd be switching to Tux.
Seems like it's time to either fix khttpd or pull it from the kernel.
What was the last kernel version where khttpd was stable (if any)?
