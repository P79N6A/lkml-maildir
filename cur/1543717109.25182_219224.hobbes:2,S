It's actually pretty simple. I just need to explain it more clearly.
Semaphores and wait queues seem complicated to me :>

Sending money to me won't help either, except with getting support for
new hardware. I'm working on finding and blatting a little but
significant bug that's made its way in since 2.0. Then I'm only going to
be working on merging.
Rob, I would concentrate on figuring out what makes Pavel's version work
for you and the other two not work. Perhaps then we can adjust our
implementations to address the issue and make you a happy camper :>
Regards,
Nigel
