RAID seems a much more viable solution to me.  That and cheaper storage, 
so that you can actually afford to replace the disk when you find 
corruption, or have more redundancy so you don't have to.
Because "robust filesystems" is nice in theory, but in practice, you 
really never know what will get hit.  RAID, at least, is predictable.
When it's not:  Backups.
