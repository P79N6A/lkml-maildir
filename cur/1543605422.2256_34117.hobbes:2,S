That's an interesting question, and one that depends on the answer to
several questions.
The mechanism for going to sleep is dependent first on the architecture
and secondly on the power managment scheme. It is up to the scheme to work
out the finer details concerning it.
(That's not a copout; we're just not likely to have a generic suspend
routine. Even if every implementation is using the same mechanism, I don't
know if it could ever be consolidated into one singular body of code.)
So then, how do we do suspend to disk? All the progress in that area has
been made by swsusp. I don't know the finer details of how it works, so
I'm not about to comment on how to make it work or modify it to better fit
our needs. Maybe someone from that camp could comment on whether or not
the 3-stage model would completely screw them or not? Or, how to make it
work under this model? Or if it even matters?
