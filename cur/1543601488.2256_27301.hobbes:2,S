That could happen though it sounds unlikely on a PIII.

Yes, according to the changlog.  But apics are generally much higher.

It shouldn't be trying to call the BIOS.
Have you run memtest86?  Seriously knowing that you don't have
bad memory or a bad memory setup would be rule out all kinds of problems.
Hmm. 0xfefe0c0 is just below 256 megs (I assume that is what you have in your
machine).  The kernel allocates memory from the top down, at least it did last
time I looked.  I can't think of a reason it would jump there, but I
can see it having a variable allocated up there.
On the other hand an address like: 0xc0e0ef0f (reverse endian) is
really wacky but completely inside of the kernel address space.
