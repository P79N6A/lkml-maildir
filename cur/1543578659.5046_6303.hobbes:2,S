Hi,
I have just compiled 2.4.0-ac7, and this kernel boots up OK (no more
processes missing from the output of "ps -ef", either). However, I am
now getting an unresolved symbol "queued_sectors" in scsi_mod.o when I
run depmod.
I've done a "make mproper; <copied in .config file>; make oldconfig;
make dep" and none of the .ver files in include/linux/modules contains
a reference to queued_sectors, nor does this symbol appear in
/proc/ksyms. However, it does appear in the System.map file as
c025335c B queued_sectors
I have worked around the problem by compiling scsi_mod.o into the
kernel instead.
Cheers,
Chris
