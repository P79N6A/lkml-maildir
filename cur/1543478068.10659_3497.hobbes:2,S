I tried setting the load-base to various values, and all of them caused dumps
within the monitor (I tried 10 meg, 64 meg, 3 meg, 120 meg, and even 4 meg + 4
all to no avail).
Also, Gary Thomas's 2.0.32 kernel seemed to have no problem in sizing memory,
so I presume it is able to pick up the residual data.
