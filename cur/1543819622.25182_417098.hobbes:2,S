But considerably more slowly, I thought; but I could well be wrong,
it's not something I've thought a great deal about.

You're assuming that resume worked on this before: not all the time.
This laptop is new to me, with several different issues in the
suspend to RAM area (e.g. the MSI business just fixed in -rc2).
I've not had it resuming reliably until just now: so I think that
with 2.6.16 (where I started out) it would (modulo other issues)
resume successfully when the former code worked out at 2 seconds,
but not when it worked out at 1 second.
One of the few things I'm sure of is that mdelay(1000) proved to be
not enough; maybe even mdelay(2000) is not enough, and I just haven't
yet hit a case which would show that.
