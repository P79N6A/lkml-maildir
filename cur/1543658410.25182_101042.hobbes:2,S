I've had it work on 2 IBM x86 boxes.
4/8-way SMP
1/4/16 GB RAM
no AGP
Intel Profusion Chipset and some funky IBM one
It failed on the NUMA-Q's I tried it on.  I haven't investigated any 
more thoroughly.
If you want more details, let me know.  But, I've never seen your 
"Calibrating delay loop..." problem.  The last time I saw problems 
there was when I broke the interrupt stack patches.  But, since those 
aren't in mainline, you shouldn't be seeing it.
