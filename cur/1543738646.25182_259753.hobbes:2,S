Doubtful.  I've read too many of your posts to think that it's very
likely! ;)

My (completely uninformed) guess is that the CKRM folks thought it would
be extremely unlikely to be able to get the 'vrm' into the kernel
without something to use it.  Linus, and the rest of the community, has
been understandably reluctant to pick up large chunks of code on the
assurance that "someone, someday will use these hooks".  The fair share
scheduler is thus both a proof of concept that the 'vrm' works and a
user of the 'vrm'.  The 'vrm' and the fair share scheduler, should be
logically separate pieces of code, though.  I should *really* read
through the CKRM code before I continue any further as I am purely
speculating now...

Apology accepted, Paul.  IBM is a large company, and this thread in
particular has had many @ibm.com posters.  It can seem there is some
large IBM conspiracy to block your efforts, but I can assure you that
isn't the case.  Unless the small, painless chips on the backs of our
necks are working far better than I think they do.... :)
