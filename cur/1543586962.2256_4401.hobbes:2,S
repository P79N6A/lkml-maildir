The user-mode port of 2.4.3 is available.
Added --help and --version, which do the obvious things
UML now creates a /tmp/uml/<name> pid file.  The name can be set with the 
'-umid=<name>' switch.  This is intended to make it easier for a UI to control 
a number of virtual machines.  There is a more general interface coming which 
will replace the pid file with a socket to a low-level console inside UML.
Fixed several major crashes and numerous smaller bugs.  The major fixes 
required some surgery from which UML still hasn't totally recovered, so it's 
still a bit wobbly.  In particular, if it swaps, processes will start 
segfaulting, and the swap code will start spitting out various 
frightening-sounding messages.
A number of hostfs bugfixes and cleanup.  One major new feature here - hostfs 
can now be the root filesystem.  This is done by assigning a directory to a 
ubd device, i.e. 'ubd0=/path/to/uml/root'.  A little bit of magic will cause 
this to be mounted as a hostfs filesystem.  Requirements: hostfs compiled into 
the kernel, /etc/fstab in that filesystem must have the / fs type as hostfs, 
you (the user running UML) must own all the files (they will be magically 
owned by root inside the virtual machine).
modify_ldt is now implemented.
/proc/cmdline is now right.
gdb automatically gets breakpoints set on panic and BUG.
