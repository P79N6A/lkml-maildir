If it does, it is a bug in the reserve accounting.  That said, I still 
agree with you that per-node reserve is a desirable goal for numa.  I 
would just like to be clear that it is not necessary, even for numa, 
just nice.  By all means somebody should be hacking on a numa feature 
for per-node emergency reserves, but as far as fixing the immediate, 
serious kernel block IO deadlocks goes, it does not matter.
Pavel, I do not agree that efficiency is unimportant on the 
under-pressure path.  I do not even like to call that the "emergency" 
path, because under heavy load it is normal for a machine to spend a 
significant fraction of its time in that state.  However, the 
efficiency goal there does not need to be quite the same as normal 
mode.
To illustrate, I would expect to see something like 95% of normal block 
IO performance on a numa machine in the case that "emergency" (aka 
memalloc memory) is allocated globally instead of locally, thus paying 
a (modest compared to the disk transfer itself) penalty for transfer of 
disk data over the numa interconnect.  95% of normal throughput on the 
block IO path is not a problem: if the machine spends 5% of its time on 
the "emergency" (aka memalloc) path, then overall efficiency will be 
95% * 95% = 99.75%.
Moral of this story: let's get the memory recursion fixes done in the 
most obviously correct way and not get distracted by illusory 
efficiency requirements for numa, that do not have a big bottom line 
impact.
I'm glad to see everybody still interested in these problems.  Though we 
have been a little quiet on this issue over here for a while, it does 
not mean that progress has stopped.  In fact, we are testing our 
solutions more heavily than ever, and getting closer to a solution that 
not only works solidly, but that should enable mass deletion of the 
whole creaky notion of dirty page limits in favor of nice, tight 
per-device control of in flight write traffic as I have described 
previously.
Regards,
Daniel
