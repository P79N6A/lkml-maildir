Tried many things, in no particular order
o PCI chipsets disabled
o Disabled TCQ (device doesn't support it anyway)
o DMA disabled and ide_setup_dma() stub function added so it'll compile
o PCI Generic chipset support enabled
o Intel PIIX chipset support enabled
o All chipset under the sun supported
All come up with the same errors. The following workarounds let it
boot
o Removing inc_preempt_count() and dec_preempt_count() from kmap_atomic()
  and kunmap_atomic()
o Disabling high memory
o Disabling taskfile IO
A quickie patch to sched.c shows that preempt_count() keeps incrementing
for each time the sleeping while atomic message is printed by the
cpu_idle() thread
