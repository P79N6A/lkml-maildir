Technically, I assume both OCFS, Lustre, (OpenGFS), PolyServe and
basically /everyone/ doing a cluster file system, proprietary or not,
will eventually need this capability. Vendors have included hooks for
this in 2.4 already anyway.
So on technical grounds, I'm strongly inclined to support it, but I
would like to suggest that it is ensured that the hook is sufficient for
all of the named CFS.
Paul, have you spoken with them?

If you are worried about this one, you can export it GPL-only, which as
an Open Source developer I'd appreciate, but from a real-world business
perspective would be unhappy about ;-)
