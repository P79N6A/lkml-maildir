For non-developers size and speed of the kernel matter much more than 
compile time.
When you go towards embedded systems with limited resources a 1% size 
decrease would often be worth it even if it would (hypothetically) 
increase the compile time by a factor of 10.

They did everything right.
You should better try to understand the problem first before behaving as 
if you knew everything better than everyone else...
