Jes has this shiny new IA64 uncached foo bar whizbang driver (see the patch
at http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111416930927092&w=2),
which has a nopage routine that calls remap_pfn_range from ->nopage for
uncached memory that's not part of the mem map.  Because ->nopage wants
to return a struct page * he's allocating a normal kernel page and actually
returns that one - to get the page he wants into the pagetables his does
all the pagetable manipulation himself before (See the glory details of
pagetable walks and modification inside a driver in the patch above).
I don't think these hacks are acceptable for a driver, especially as the
problem can easily be solved by calling remap_pfn_range in ->mmap - except
SGI also wants node locality..
