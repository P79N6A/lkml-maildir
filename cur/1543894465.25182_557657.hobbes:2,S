IANAL, but AFAICT it doesn't.  Still, encoded in the spirit (that
refers to free software, bringing in the free software definition), is
the notion of protecting users' freedoms, among them the freeom #0, to
run the software for any purpose.
That's why I believe it's in the spirit of the license to defend this
freedom.
And that's why lawyers in Brazil believe that, even though the GPL
does not affirm the right to run the software, it fits the bill,
because, under the light of the preamble, the free software
definition, and the US copyright law, it should be interpreted as an
intent to grant permission to run the software.

Got it.  That's bad.  :-(
