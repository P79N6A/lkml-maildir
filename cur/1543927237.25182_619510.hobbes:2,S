Repeating what I posted earlier from the ARP RFC 826:
	"The target hardware address is included for completeness and
	network monitoring.  It has no meaning in the request form,
	since it is this number that the machine is requesting.  Its
	meaning in the reply form is the address of the machine making
	the request.  In some implementations (which do not get to look
	at the 14.byte ethernet header, for example) this may save some
	register shuffling or stack space by sending this field to the
	hardware driver as the hardware destination address of the
	packet.
Unless there is some other RFC that supercedes this, which doesn't appear
to be the case since it's also STD37, it appears to me that the current
Linux behavior is wrong.  It clearly states that for the ARP reply, the
target hardware address is "the address of the machine making the request",
and not the address of the machine making the reply as Linux is apparently
doing.

I agree the target protocol address should be 0 in this case.
