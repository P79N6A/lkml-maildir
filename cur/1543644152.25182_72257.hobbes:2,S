Having done a 2.5.36 config recently from scratch, I have a few thoughts
on the organization.
1 - why is clock in GMT part of APM?
2 - why aren't all the SCSI drivers in the low level drivers section in
some more intuitive grouping?
3 - same thing for NICs.
I have the impression that there is a lot of work being done in this area,
and there may be limitations of the dependencies causing this. If this
isn't all about to change I would love to do some reorg. I just don't want
to do something not useful.
