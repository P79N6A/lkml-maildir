Hi Anton,
I'm trying to work around the NTFS lockup issue. Like others, I can reproduce
it just by opening nautilus on an NTFS partition (i.e. creating an inotify
watch on it) and then unmount at some point after - instant system lockup.
I have tried applying two patches:
fix-soft-lockup-due-to-ntfs-vfs-part-and-explanation.patch from 2.6.13-rc1-mm1
and the "NTFS: Fix a nasty deadlock that appeared in recent kernels" patch
from your git tree.
However, I still get the freezing up on unmount. I am using 2.6.12, plus
inotify-0.23-15, and the two patches mentioned above. Anything else I can try?
Thanks,
Daniel
