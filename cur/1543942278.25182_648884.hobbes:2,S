Hi,
I tried the current git (9ef9dc69d4167276c04590d67ee55de8380bc1ad) and
got the following error message from ath5k:
ath5k_pci 0000:02:00.0: registered as 'phy0'
ath5k phy0: failed to resume the MAC Chip
ath5k_pci: probe of 0000:02:00.0 failed with error -5
Here is the lspci -vnn output:

The same device works with madwifi:

I can also set the interface up and use iwlist ath0 scan.
