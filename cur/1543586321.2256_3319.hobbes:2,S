If the time between syncs gets to big then the amount of data to go over
the bus would kill performance. Plus this has the problem that even
small areas like 12x20 areas become more expensive as the bpp increases. A
better solution is to implement accelerated copyareas. In fact for 2.5.X I
have the fbcon system wrapped around using accels instead of writing to the
framebuffer directly. I have had enormous improvements doing this. Plus
using this approach makes the fbcon layer much simpler and smaller in size.
Thus better performace overall.
