I've recently installed Mandrake 9.0 on a Dell Optiplex GX260 with a P4 
2.00 GHz at work.  As UDMA didn't work (a known issue with 2.4.19 on i845G 
boards), I compiled 2.4.20-pre8 with GCC 3.2.  I have a couple of 
questions on hardware support.  Dmesg and .config are attached.
a.) I haven't seen the "ACPI table" lines before on any of my systems, and 
I didn't enable ACPI in the kernel configuration.  Assuming that's 
supposed to be there, I was under the impression that only the non-Xeon 
P4's supported hyperthreading, yet it claims that there are two processors 
present.  I could just compile with SMP support, but any ideas on why it's 
giving me that?
b.) Is it a problem that the it reports that BIOS setup for the ICH4 was 
incomplete?  Nothing appears to be broken and I do get UDMA, but my CD 
drive appears to disable it right after boot.
I'm not on the mailing list, so please CC me and remove the NOSPAM.  
Thanks.
