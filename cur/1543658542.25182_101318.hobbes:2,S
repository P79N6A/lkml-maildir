<jsimmons@maxwell.earthlink.net> (03/01/08 1.887)
   [MONITOR support] GTF support for VESA complaint monitors. Here we calculate the general timings needed so we don't over step the bounds for a monitor.

   [RIVA FBDEV] Driver now uses its own fb_open and fb_release function again. It has no ill effects. The drivers uses strickly hardware acceleration so we don't need cfb_fillrect and cfb_copyarea.
   Cleaned up font.h. Geerts orignal pacth broke them up into a font.h in video and one in  linux. Now I put them back together again in include/linux. The m68k platform has been updated for this change.
