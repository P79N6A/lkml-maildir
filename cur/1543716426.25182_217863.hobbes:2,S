I thought that would be the purpose of i2c_use_client(), like the comment
in linux/i2c.h suggests? That call also takes care of the ALLOW_USE flag.
i2c_use_client() increments both the drivers and the adapters module ref
count, if I see it correctly. Then it also increments the clients usage count,
after checking the ALLOW_MULTIPLE_USE flag.
Its counterpart is i2c_release_client().
