Subject: Too much debug info in PPC iBook through evbug_event()

I don't if this is supposed to happen, but my iBook just after boot was swamped 
with debug information every time I pressed some key, moved my mouse or pressed 
any mouse button.
The debug information came from:
drivers/input/evbug.c:
static void evbug_event(struct input_handle *handle, unsigned int type, unsigned 
int code, int value)
{
     printk(KERN_DEBUG "evbug.c: Event. Dev: %s, Type: %d, Code: %d, Value: 
%d\n", handle->dev->phys, type, code, value);
}
The system was unusable, since typing the username meant flooding the screen 
with several lines of debug info.
