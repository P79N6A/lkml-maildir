Hi,
sorry for answering so late, I'm only tracking netdev and ppc mailing list.

The eHEA driver tries to orginize its sys-entries as close as possible to
other ethernet drivers. Each eHEA NIC has multiple ports which is not that
common in PCI. This means that each port is represented by a subdirectory
which has not the "driver" sys-link, only the root directory has.
Some tools expect to have this driver link in each port directory.
That is the reason why this link is created manually.
Are there any other ways to create this link?
