Subject: [PATCH] fix writing to unintended memory in pkt_generic_packet(); drivers/block/pktcdvd.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

CDROM_PACKET_SIZE is added as an offset to the pointer to unsigned char cmd[16].
The adjusted pointer is then used as a destination address in a call to
memset(). However, when CDROM_PACKET_SIZE is added to the pointer, it is
automatically scaled by the size of cmd, which is 16. This results in the call
to memset() writing to unintended memory.
