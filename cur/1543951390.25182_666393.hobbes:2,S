Oh, I see, thanks.  Well, I don't feel all that strongly about it; but
on the whole I'd prefer we leave it as part of the __init, than change
it around to provide this example (and risk introducing some weird issue
e.g. related to its "dev"?).  I guess the same should go for the huge
and the tiny, whereas you have better justification in the idr case.
Call me over-cautious.
