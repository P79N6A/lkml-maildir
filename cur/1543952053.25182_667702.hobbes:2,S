if we allocate usemap continuously,
old way could make different usermap share one page. usermap size is
only about 24bytes. align to 128bytes ( the SMP cache lines)
sparse_early_usemap_alloc: usemap = ffff810024e00000 size = 24
sparse_early_usemap_alloc: usemap = ffff810024e00080 size = 24
sparse_early_usemap_alloc: usemap = ffff810024e00100 size = 24
sparse_early_usemap_alloc: usemap = ffff810024e00180 size = 24
