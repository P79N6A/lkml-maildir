It may be worth asking the Samba people if they want it given that Windows 
has such a function (but it is not a syscall, it is a fsctl - 
FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA), so Samba may want to have it, too...
And in case you care, NTFS already has such functionality (currently only 
used in error handling) and implementing the sys_punchole() fs-specific 
function for ntfs will therefore be trivial...
Best regards,
