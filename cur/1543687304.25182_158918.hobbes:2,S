Well its just so hard to get right. If someone could demonstrate a
big performance improvement, then the scheduler might need fixing
anyway.
For example, on your machines, its very likely that your new machines
would benefit more from big timeslices than the old ones due to more
cache, quicker cpu to memory, multiple cpus...
