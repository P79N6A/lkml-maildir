I tell you it isn't. The documentation you can find in layout.h in 
ntfs-driver-tng and linux-ntfs and in the tng source is written by _me_ 
based on reverse engineering the ntfs driver. It took me several months to 
do this. If you look at the collation code and particular the name 
collation you will see why... And no this is NOT documented anywhere AFAIK.

Yes, that isn't documented either. And according to Jeff Merkey there are 
patent infringement issues with the log file.
>How recovery is handled.
It's documented on a concept level in "Inside Windows NT/2000" 2nd/3rd Ed 
from Microsoft press. But that doesn't help zilch in understanding the 
on-disk layout.

Yes. ntfs tng will just unconditionally empty the journal completely as 
soon as someone performs a write mount. Currently you need to run ntfsfix 
(from linux-ntfs package) in order to achieve this after writing with the 
current ntfs driver.
>NTFS write was (briefly) available until the lawyers came to the door.
This is simply not true. The Linux driver is able to write. The problem is 
it does so very badly and corrupts the partition which doesn't make it very 
useful. At present I have stable write support to normal, existing files 
but directory operations are still broken. However I have now abandoned 
trying to fix the old driver's write support. NTFS TNG will have full write 
support eventually (but read support is not quite finished yet...).
>Along with an external tool to recover NTFS file systems.
If you are refering to my ntfsfix that is available from sourceforge, 
linux-ntfs project and package of same name.
If you are refering to microsoft's diskedit that is available on the 
Windows NT 4 SP4 CDROM which one can obtain from various sources.
No other recovery tool has been made publically available AFAIK.
