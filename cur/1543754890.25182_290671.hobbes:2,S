Hi Eric,

Agreed. Primary kernel need not to be aware of backup region and 
reservation of this region can be better managed from user space.

Not really. crashbackup= is not being used for carving out backup
region. It is just used for passing the address of this region to second
kernel. That's why it has been put under CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP.

This looks good. So memory regions are parsed from /proc/iomem and this
information is put in one data segment and stored in reserved region
during panic kernel load time.
But I am unable to co-relate as to how the capture tool (even if its all
in user space) gets to know the address of this segment (or for that
matter, the bss segment created for backup region). Am I missing
something obvious.

This seems to be a good direction.
