Lets see:
- You want less code (for good reason, it really is a lot more
  than the equivalent in perl)
- Marco wants the blacklist only to work when invoked via kernel,
  and needs only /etc/hotplug/blacklist.d.
- Marco wants the blacklist to apply after alias expansion
  rather than before.
- I want to avoid install commands whenever possible.
  The reason is that for building an initramfs, I need to interpret
  modprobe output and decide what goes on the image.  For 'insmod'
  that's easy; but I don't know of a way to interpret install
  command lines and deciding *reliably* what executables and libraries
  need to go on the image.  (incidentally, this is a use case
  where blacklist interpretation is desirable, even though modprobe
  is not invoked by the kernel)
Here's an alternative approach that should cover these interests:
- add a keyword 'blacklist' to the configuration language,
  that will be interpreted after alias expansion, but before
  searching modules.dep.
Advantages:
- it needs a lot less code
- distributions can decide whether blacklists work always,
  never, or only for the kernel simply by playing with which
  configuration file is used
- my initramfs builder does not have to be special cased
  to know that some install directives really are blacklist
  directives.
If this approach seems workable to you, I plan to build something
like this tomorrow.

That's a hint I guess ...  OK, next patch will go through the suite.
