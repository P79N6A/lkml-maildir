Well, the readpage error should be rare (and for the _normal_ case we just 
do the "wait_on_page_locked()" thing). And I think we should lock the page 
in order to do the truncation check, no?
But I don't have any really strong feelings. I'm certainly ok with the 
patch I sent out. How about putting it through -mm? Here's my sign-off:
	Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
if you want to send it off to Andrew (or if Andrew wants to just take it 
himself ;)
Btw, how did you even notice this? Just by reading the source, or because 
you actually saw multiple errors reported?
