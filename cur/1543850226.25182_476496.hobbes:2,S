Found it... I had this experimental udev rule which puts the devices in
/dev/bus/usb/ and pcscd keeps scanning the directory every second
looking for Cthulhu knows what:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_endpoint",      PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'K=%k; E=$${K#*_}; K=$${K#usbdev}; K=$${K%%%%_*}; printf bus/usb/%%03i/%%03i_%%s $${K%%%%.*} $${K#*.} $$E'", \
