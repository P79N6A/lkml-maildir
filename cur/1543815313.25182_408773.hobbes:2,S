umm yes, but what for?
What does this entire feature *do*?  Why does Linux need it?
OK, so it allows kernel modules to set breakpoints (via debug traps) into
user code.  But why do we want to be able to do that?  What are the
use-cases?
This may sound like boringly obvious stuff to you, but without a complete
problem statement from the designers, how are we to evaluate their proposed
solution?
