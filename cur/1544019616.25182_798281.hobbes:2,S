With 2.6.29-rc3 suspend/resume has started working on my workstation again 
(did not resume with rc2 - not sure when it broke) but tg3 is dead 
after resume.
This is similar to the issue reported back in Jul 2007 - 
http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2007/8/1/154073/thread
 
which was fixed with a patch to unconditionally save/restore pci config 
space - that one is still in tg3.c.
After resume tg3 complains that no firmware is running and eth0 is 
non-existent. Rmmoding and modprobing tg3 again causes some timeouts and 
errors from tg3 and the link still doesn't work.
Reboot fixes it.
