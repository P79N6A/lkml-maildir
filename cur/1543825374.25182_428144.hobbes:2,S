Well, all of this happens so early, I doubt anything will cause actual
harm, for get_unmapped_area to be a problem, something would have to
concurrently allocate a VMA (or dispose of) I think that can't happen at
this point before we even run the binary but yes, better safe than
sorry... I supose the whole patch could get in 2.6.17 even without the
arch_vma_name (that is it can be there, it wont be used though until
your patch gets in).
Ben.
