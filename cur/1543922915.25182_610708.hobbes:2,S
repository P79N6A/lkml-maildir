For special files, f_op->fsetattr will be NULL, since
init_special_inode() will set up i_fop that way.
So the filesystem's fsetattr() will only be called for regular files
and/or directories, depending on how it sets up i_fop.
With the ia_file thing, the filesystem would receive the struct file
pointer in all cases.  So the posted patch would break AFS and FUSE,
because they unconditionally use ia_file if available and don't check
the file type.  They could check the file type, but still the interface
would be ugly.

Ah, so if we kept ATTR_FILE and got rid of iattr_file, would that be OK
for AppArmor? 
Thanks,
