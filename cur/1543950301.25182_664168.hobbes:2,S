Overall this looks good, thanks.
As a follow on patch this should be moved from /proc/<pid>/net
into /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/net.
We don't have anything that currently forces network namespaces to be
the same between different tasks of the same task group (I just
looked), nor do we have a technical reason to require that.
So we should fix our infrastructure to include the companion of
/proc/self, a /proc/current (which points at the current task)
after which it should be about a two line change to move this
from the tgid to the task directory.
