This is something I've wanted to see for years now.  Linux distributions 
do not have the motivation to work out the hardware certification issues 
on the community level, as it interferes with their value add of branding.  
I have always wished that when I see hardware advertising Linux support 
that it has a meaning: open source, supportable drivers.  Maybe it's time 
to get such a project moving.
