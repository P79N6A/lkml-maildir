Hi,
It's important to note that disk-replacement type SSDs perform much 
better with very small block operations, generally 512 bytes.  So the 
lower your file system block size, the better -- this will be the single 
most significant performance tweak one should do.   This is true for the 
benchmarks I've seen where the difference between 4KB and 512Byte block 
sizes was almost 100%.   YMMV -- always benchmark.
On SSDs which contain built in wear leveling, pretty much any file 
system can be used.   For SSDs that lack such low level housekeeping, 
use stuff like JFFS2.
