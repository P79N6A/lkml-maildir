okay. I'll try again if people admit me to go ahead.

I'm sorry if I don't read SUSv3 correctly. SUSv3 doesn't define how we should
do if SIGCHLD is not blocked.(so I don't check not-blocked case.)
IMHO, user's sig-child-handler is tend to call wait()/waitpid() and expects
successful return. So removing stale signal here may be good.
If this breaks assumptions of applications on Linux, I'll not go eagerly.
