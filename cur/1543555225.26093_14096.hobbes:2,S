Wrong list, but this needs to be set straight. Please send any further

This doesn't happen here. It's supposed to use modprobe, which

How did you install that?
From a relatively fresh 6.2 install (this box doesn't have any SCSI
controllers or soundcards):
# cat /etc/conf.modules
alias eth0 3c90x
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc

Are you sure the hardware is ok? Applications that usually work well
dumping core is usually a sign of bad memory or overheated CPUs. See
http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/
 for more detailed information.
It's either this, or you've added customizations that don't work, or
you've used a CD someone has tampered with.
We know of _many_ servers running Red Hat Linux 6.2 with an uptime ever
since they first installed.

Same as (3).
I've been using 6.2 until 7 was released, I usually compile about 25
packages a day, and I've never seen ld crashing.
