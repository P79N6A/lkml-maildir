It's failing to notice errors at sync time or when such pages get
flushed due to memory pressure.

It should catch up within the flush interval or at the next sync, at
least. And then fail all further writes. Consider the scenario of a
user sitting at their laptop when a power glitch offlines their
external drive. They can copy files onto it for the next hour, delete
the originals and be completely unaware that anything is wrong unless
they happen to check dmesg.

An FS-level callback when the underlying block device went for a walk
would be a nice hook just about everywhere. And at least a start on
the problem.
