Ok I finished now my asm optimized rwsemaphores and I improved a little my
spinlock based one but without touching the icache usage.
Here it is the code against pre6 vanilla:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.4pre6/rwsem-8
here the same but against David's try#2:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.4pre6/rwsem-8-against-dh-try2
and here again the same but against David's latest try#3:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.4pre6/rwsem-8-against-dh-try3
The main advantage of my rewrite are:
-	my x86 version is visibly faster than yours in the write fast path and it
	also saves icache because it's smaller (read fast path is reproducibly a bit faster too)
-	my spinlock version is visibly faster in both read and write fast path and still
	has smaller icache footprint (of course my version is completly out of line too
	and I'm comparing apples to apples)
-	at least to me the slow path of my code seems to be much simpler
	than yours (and I can actually understand it ;), for example I don't feel
	any need of any atomic exchange anywhere, I admit now comparing
	my code to yours I still don't know why you need it
-	the common code automatically extends itself to support 2^32 concurrent sleepers
	on 64bit archs
-	there is no code duplication at all in supporting xchgadd common code logic
	for other archs (and I prepared a skeleton to fill for the alpha)
Only disavantage is that sparc64 will have to fixup some bit again.
Here the numbers of the above patches on top of vanilla 2.4.4-pre6:
----------------------------------------------
RWSEM_XCHGADD y in rwsem-2.4.4-pre6 + my latest rwsem
rw

RWSEM_SPINLOCK y in rwsem-2.4.4-pre6 + my latest rwsem
rw
reads taken: 6061713
writes taken: 3129801
reads taken: 6099046
writes taken: 3148951
r1
reads taken: 14251500
reads taken: 14265389
r2
reads taken: 4972932
reads taken: 4936267
ro
reads taken: 4253814
reads taken: 4253432
w1
writes taken: 13652385
writes taken: 13632914
wo
writes taken: 1751857
writes taken: 1753608
I draw a graph with the above numbers compared to the previous quoted numbers I
generated a few hours ago with your latest try#3 (attached). (W1 and R1 are
respectively the benchmark of the write fast path and read fast path, only one
writer and only one reader and they're of course the most interesting ones)
So I'd suggest Linus to apply one of my above -8 patches for pre7. (I hope I
won't need any secondary try)
this is a diffstat of the rwsem-8 patch:
