If my box has two serial ports and I use setserial to change the port,
I still only have two serial ports.  Shouldn't this behave as a
hotplug remove/add when the port address is changed?

This is definitely not in the current spirit of hotplug. The PCMCIA
card should generate a hotplug add event and then the script for the
event can do the setserial equivalent.
You could probably modify setserial to create the scripts and the user
would never know things changed.
