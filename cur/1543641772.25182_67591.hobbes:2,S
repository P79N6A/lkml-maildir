I don't know, though... scratching my head here -- Is GCC actually
able to distinguish between 'const int *a' and 'int const *a'?
Because if 'int const *a' means that the pointer is constant but
not the actual value it points to,
void a(int const *a) { *a = 1; }
shouldn't be generating 'warning: assignment of read-only location'.
Right?
