Two of them don't even compile any more.
The patch below removes them and all code depending on them and makes 
the remaining one (MTD_SHARP) compilable again.

MTD_OBSOLETE_CHIPS shouldn't be marked as BROKEN.
This patch brings the MTD_SHARP driver back into life and removes the 
non-compiling MTD_AMDSTD and MTD_JEDEC with everything depending on 
them.
