No comments on the code itself - It is interesting to have certain pids "not selectable" by
the OOM killer. Patches which have similar funcionality have been floating around.
The userspace OOM killer is dangerous though. You have to guarantee that allocations 
will NOT happen until the OOM killer is executed and the killed process is dead and
has its pages freed - allocations under OOM can cause deadlocks. 
"OOM-killer-in-userspace" is unreliable, not sure if its worth the effort making
it reliable (mlock it, flagged as PF_MEMALLOC, etc).
