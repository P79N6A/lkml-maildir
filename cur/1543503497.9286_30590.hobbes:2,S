Hi Joe.

I can point to one NT based system with an uptime measured in weeks.
Problem is, it achieves that within an hour of power-up due to an NT
bug that causes the system clock to run at about 1,000 times normal
speed - one can watch the clock rotate quite happily...
The said system is only usd for playing games, so the owner isn't
worried about the bug. However, it makes a good talking point...
Best wishes from Riley.
