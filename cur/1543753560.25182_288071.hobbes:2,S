Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/4] interruptible rwsem and their usage for cpucontrol
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/19/257

The following four patches add support for interruptible trying to grab
R/W-semaphores (patches by Nick Piggin), and use (interruptible) rwsems 
to improve the disabling of CPU hotplug operations. The latter was
already discussed earlier on this list[1].
