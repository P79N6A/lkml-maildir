No, this is not what is happening to me.  It happens with all the pipes
empty and the systems idle, there are no timeouts or bottlenecks involved.
Setting:
	*idle* systems
	*idle* PPP (MTU/MRU 296)
	*idle* eth0
	always_defrag is turned on
Some systems completely fail to forward, and changing the PPP MTU/MRU to
1500 fixes it.  To me, this means they are not defragmenting, and of
course the fragments can't masquerade.  There is a bug in the
always_defrag.
