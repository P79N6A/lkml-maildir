nIEN is set to allow the device to interrupt the host controller.
Some host controllers have the ablity to block and hold sticky that
transaction to the CPU.
You set nIEN and we need a whole new set of state diagrams for the driver.
nIEN = 0,  interrupt driver
nIEN = 1,  polling driver 
You may not switch this in the middle of the execution of a command block.
If you want to try this, go for it, and leave me off the CC for the mess
you will make of your data.
