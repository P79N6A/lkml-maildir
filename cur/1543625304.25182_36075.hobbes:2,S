OK, I have fixed above mentioned formatting issues. A patch is attached.
And, about sleeping in loop_make_request(), I have also changed the code in
such way that it defaults to code that may sleep in loop_make_request(). But
non-sleeping code is still present (but not currently used), like this:
#if 1
    may-sleep-in-loop_make_request-code-here
#else
    non-sleeping-loop_make_request-code-here
#endif

This new patch does not remove LO_FLAGS_BH_REMAP optimization.

2.4.19-pre3 loop code wanders to loop_get_buffer() and transfer function in
LO_FLAGS_BH_REMAP optimization case.
My version is simpler than yours:
        if (lo->lo_flags & LO_FLAGS_BH_REMAP) {
                rbh->b_rsector += (lo->lo_offset >> 9);
                rbh->b_rdev = lo->lo_device;
                return 1;
        }
