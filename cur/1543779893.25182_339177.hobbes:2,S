I think you mis-understand. Mountlo seems to allow one to mount
(through FUSE) any filesystem image for which there is a linux kernel
kernel driver available. This is a very nice capability.
But what I speak of is to port the 100% feature-complete (and
well-tested) befs driver from the Haiku project's kernel to the FUSE 
interface. This should be a considerably easier task than porting it
to the linux kernel vfs interface. Among other reasons for this, parts
of Haiku's kernel (including their befs driver) are written in c++.
