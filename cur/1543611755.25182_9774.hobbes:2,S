Dear all,
In mm/page_io.c the function rw_swap_page_base() , since 2.4.14 the
rw==WRITE case is missing. Does that mean rw_swap_page_base will never
be called with rw==WRITE? That is rw_swap_page_base will never used to
write a swap page? Then where does the swap write goes? Also the auto 
int "zone_used" is never used twice and it seems useless, it is sitting
there and wasting for memory. The 2.4.16 still keep the traditon int
"zone_used" which is totally usless.
regards,
David Chow
