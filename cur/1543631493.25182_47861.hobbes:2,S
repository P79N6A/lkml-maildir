Please do *grin* I will probably have to write a driver for just such
a card (a PC104 card though, but that's just a differenct connector),
so I'd love to have such a driver.  And as long as the driver is
self-contained and doesn't mess with other parts of the kernel I can't
see why it shouldn't be included in Linus' tree.  The same is IMHO
true about /dev/port, it's rather self-contained and is less than 50
source lines in mem.c.  It may be ugly but it's useful for some people.
