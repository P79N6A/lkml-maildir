Well, in this particular case it is not very likely to happen.  I have three
x86_64 machines here with totally different chipsets/devices on which I'm
not seeing anything like that and I believe we'd have more reports before
if that were a common issue.
That said, I'm not going to ignore it.  I'll do my best to debug and fix it, if
Tobias helps me. :-)
Greetings,
Rafael
