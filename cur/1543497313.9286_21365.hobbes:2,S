You still need the stty -F /dev/ttyS1 clocal, if clocal is off and
DCD is low, the shell will hang opening the serial device. That's
the entire point of this thread ...
Ofcourse you should also use proper locking, and for that you will
need an external utility anyway as that's impossible in a shell script ..
