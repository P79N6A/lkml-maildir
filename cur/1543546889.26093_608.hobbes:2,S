Yes, I "got it".  If you lookback a few messages you'd see that that's
exactly what I said it SHOULD work like.  However, it was then pointed
out that this wasn't what POSIX mandated (urgh) and then I started trying
to think what would be needed to make that work.  I'm not saying normal
happy clones would use this, just CLONE_PID_POSIX_ME_HARDER threads.

Yes, but:
  * If we're going to give POSIX threads the illusion of a shared PID then
    to be strictly correct the exec'ed process needs to have that PID too.
    If we want to do this, then an execve from any random thread won't
    do.
  * What happens if the execve fails?  I suspect POSIX would want us to
    return an error code to that thread without interfering with the
    existing threads.  But wait, we've already "kill -9"'ed them all.
    To get this right would definately require kernel support.  The
    kernel must atomically end all the other threads when it knows the
    execve isn't going to return an error.
Luckily, under my "master kernel thread" theory this isn't THAT hard -
just evaluate the execve and when you know it will succeed make the

Absolutely.  These are the sane semantics for native threads.
