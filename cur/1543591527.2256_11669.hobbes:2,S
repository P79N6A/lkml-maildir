Thus spake Alan Cox (alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk):
> Can you boot a kernel without fdomain.c compiled in next
Yes, but I am too stupid: there were a faillure in my
patch-2.4.4-ac10.bz2, which is 0 bits.... so I have bunzip -c
patch-2.4.4-ac10.bz2|patch -p1 -s with an empty file :-((
That mean I compiled a 2.4.4 kernel, and not a 2.4.4-ac10 one.
I know that becauseause I reemoved my fdomain SCSI controller and put an
Adaptec 2940 at the same place, and it booted very well...
So the problem is ME: I am too stupid!!!
Anyway, the bug is in 2.4.4, not in 2.4.4-ac10: I am really sorry for
having loosing your time. With 2.4.4-ac9 with my fdomain, everything is
also working great ;-)
If I can do anything, just let me know ;-)
Thanks you very much,
	Greg
