knfsd does this sort of stuff with it's own tiny filesystem.
If you look in fs/libfs.c you will see a section headed
  Transaction based IO
which is exactly for this sort of thing.
Currently I think you need to create your own tiny filesystem (which
isn't much effort if you use the stuff in libfs).
I think I'd like this sort of file to be a standard option for sysfs
attributes, but I haven't looked seriously into the possibility yet.
