No, read my message, irq 9 doesn't get reenabled again. And as my nic is 
also on this interrupt, it cannot receive any packets anymore, usb 
doesn't work, acpi doesn't work:
9:     100000          XT-PIC  acpi, uhci-hcd, uhci-hcd, ohci1394, Intel 
82801BA-ICH2, eth0, 0000:01:02.0,
0000:01:05.0, orinoco_cs
Thanks,
Jan
