You were right, even after making the changes, it seems to be 
telling lies:
# mount
/dev/hda2 on / type ext2 (rw,usrquota)
[...]
However, I think I am still not mounting as ext2:
# dmesg | grep 'Kernel command'
Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/hda2 rootfstype=ext2
# cat /proc/mounts
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev/root / ext3 rw 0 0
/proc /proc proc rw,nodiratime 0 0
/sys /sys sysfs rw 0 0
none /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
usbfs /proc/bus/usb usbfs rw 0 0
/dev/hda1 /boot ext2 rw 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs rw,noexec 0 0
none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc rw 0 0
sunrpc /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs rpc_pipefs rw 0 0
Do I need to mess with the initrd? My grub lines look like
this:
title Fedora Core (2.6.5-1.358smp)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.5-1.358smp ro root=/dev/hda2 rootfstype=ext2
        initrd /initrd-2.6.5-1.358smp.img
title Fedora Core-up (2.6.5-1.358)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.5-1.358 ro root=/dev/hda2 rootfstype=ext2
        initrd /initrd-2.6.5-1.358.img
Thanks,
Alberto
