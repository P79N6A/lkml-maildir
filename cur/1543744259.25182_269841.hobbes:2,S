Do we really want the compiler to silently replace in-kernel functions 
with built-ins?
You can still do an explicit
  #define strlen __builtin_strlen
if you want to use a gcc built-in function.

At least with gcc 3.4.2 on i386 adding -ffreestanding and your 
(i386-specific) IN_STRING_C hack removed compiles fine.

I'm open for examples why this actually doesn't work, but after my 
(limited) testin I'd suggest the patch below for inclusion in the next 
-mm.
