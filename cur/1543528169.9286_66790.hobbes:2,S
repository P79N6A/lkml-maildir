   Just a heads up -- this problem, as reported by myself and several
   other during February for kernels 2.3.45 and up (and possibly 2.3.44)
   persists up through 2.3.48.  So far, all of the people who have
   reported problems have reported the exact same symptoms (well, I'd
   never tried to access the serial device after trying to unload the
   module, but doing so just now  gave me an instant reboot, no oops
   message).
   I've been unable to find anyone listed in MAINTAINERS who would seem
   to be responsible for the generic serial driver; if there is such a
   person, could someone point me in the right direction?
I'm the maintainer for the serial driver.  
   More information on how exactly to reproduce the problem is available
   in a variety of mail messages, and is of course also available on
   request from me.  I'm also happy to try anything that would help in
   debugging the problem, if people tell me what to do.
Can you give me a rundown of the hardware you have in your system, and a
print out of the kernel messages printed by the serial module when you
load and unload it?  (Run dmesgs and send me the output).
