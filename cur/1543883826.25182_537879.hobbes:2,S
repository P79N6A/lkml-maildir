Okay I think in-kernel typedefs have to go, but we have a defined DRM
interface like it or not and I'd like to be consistent on the
userspace interface and continue to use typedefs, I don't want to have
a major inconsistency like half the interface in typedefs the other
half in non-typedefs, considering the old interface is frozen...

Most likely in doxygen as that is what Mesa uses and the intersection
of developers is higher in that area, I'll take it as a task to try
and kerneldoc the drm at some stage..

Well we should move all that stuff to sysfs, but we have all the
infrastructure for publishing this stuff under /proc/dri and adding
new files doesn't take a major amount, as much as I appreciate sysfs,
it isn't suitable for this sort of information dump, the whole one
value per file is quite useless to provide this sort of information
which is uni-directional for users to send to us for debugging without
have to install some special tool to join all the values into one
place.. and I don't think drmfs is the answer either... or maybe it
is....

int is defined, unsigned I'm not so sure about, the drm user space
interface is usually specified in non-system specific types so the
drm.h file is consistent across systems, so we would probably have to
use uint32_t which other people have objected to, but I'd rather use
uint32_t than unspecified types..

Okay this needs fixing, we do check most ioctls args, the main thing
passed in are handles and these are all looked up in the hash table,
it may not be so obvious, also most of the ioctls are probably going
to end up root or DRM master only, I'd like do an ioctl fuzzer at some
stage, I'd suspect a lot more then the dri would be oopsable with
permissions...
Thanks,
Dave.
