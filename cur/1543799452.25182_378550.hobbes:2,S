I'm with Christoph here.  Please preserve my 
arch_mutex_fast_lock/arch_mutex_fast_unlock helpers.  I did it that way 
because the most important thing they bring is flexibility where it is 
needed i.e. in architecture specific implementations.  And done that way 
the architecture specific part is well abstracted with the minimum 
semantics allowing flexibility in the implementation.
I insist on that because, even if ARM currently relies on the atomic 
swap behavior, on ARMv6 at least this can be improved even further, but 
a special implementation which is neither a fully qualified atomic 
decrement nor an atomic swap is needed.  That's why I insist that you 
should keep my arch_mutex_fast_lock and friends (rename them if you 
wish) and remove __ARCH_WANT_XCHG_BASED_ATOMICS entirely.
