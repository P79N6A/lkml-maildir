It can really be approached much more cavalierly than that. The only
extant example aside from the original ZONE_DMA32 implementation I've
seen is Simon Winwood's MPSS patch, which needed something on the order
of 10 lines of code for a fresh zone type (for one arch).
And most of the bulk of the ZONE_DMA32 implementation was stringing up
the block layer to utilize it, not inserting the new zone type itself.
