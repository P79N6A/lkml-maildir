A modular driver for rootfs doesn't really strike me as being particularly 
useful on an embedded system where you're trying to save every byte 
possible, and you don't want to waste space on initrd support.
We're working on creating a new driver that works either as a module or 
linked into the kernel, and is 100% GPL code. I think that's probably the 
better option, in the long term.
