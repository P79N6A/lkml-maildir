In case that description sounded too silly: The essential feature
of ncp is that it requires no configuration or installation of a
server daemon, and you don't even need to worry about host names or the
IP address of the source or destination machine. Just hook two computers
to the same network and you're ready to npush/npoll. Similar to
netcat + tar, but way more convenient.
