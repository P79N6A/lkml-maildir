Have you already run into that case?
You said the set of files belong to cgroup itself is likely to increase
- do you have some candidates in mind?  Perhaps ones which are likely
to conflict with choice taskgroup names?
If anything I'd say add a 'prefix_cgroup' mount option and use it to
decide whether to prefix or not (rather than use the noprefix option).
