No; it's racy. You must use copy_from_user() and copy_to_user().

That sounds like you're scared of using goto. Don't be :)

This is often true of anything which gets pointed out during review. :)

I don't see this timepps.h of which you speak. If it's a _userspace_
file, it cannot include <linux/pps.h> unless you actually add
<linux/pps.h> to the list of files which are exported.
Run 'make headers_install' and observe that there is no file
usr/include/linux/pps.h -- so there would be no /usr/include/linux/pps.h
generated from your kernel tree. You need to add 'unifdef-y += pps.h' to
include/linux/Kbuild for that to happen.

64-bit kernels can run 32-bit userspace programs. But some structures
come out _differently_ between 32-bit and 64-bit compilation, so the
system call needs a special 'compat' handler instead of just running the
normal 64-bit system call.
The 'struct timespec' is one structure which is sometimes different for
32-bit vs. 64-bit, so any system call taking a 'struct timespec' must
have a separate compat_sys_xxxx() to handle that. See something like
compat_sys_clock_settime() in kernel/compat.c for an example (but don't
use set_fs() like it does; just see how it handles the compat_timespec).

Hm. I'll let other people complain at you about that :)
