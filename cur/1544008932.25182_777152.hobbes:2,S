Subject: [PATCH 1/3] tracing/ftrace: don't insert TRACE_PRINT during selftests
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Impact: fix tracer selfstests false results
After setting a ftrace_printk somewhere in th kernel, I saw the
Function tracer selftest failing.
When a selftest occurs, the ring buffer is lurked to see if
some entries were inserted. But concurrent insertion such as
ftrace_printk could occured at the same time and could give
false positive or negative results.
This patch prevent prevent from TRACE_PRINT entries insertion
during selftests.
