In smpboot.c we require the llc id of current CPU and all other online cpus.
I will put cpu_llc_shared_map info into cpuinfo_x86 (in future with power
savings sched policy, it will be used whenever someone changes sched policy)
And will make cpu_llc_id[] as __cpuinitdata.

Lowest domain the cpu gets attached to it is SMT domain.
