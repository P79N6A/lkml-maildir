I believe I read in Alan's diary that he's written a 3dnow! version
of the memory copy routines. As long as it doesn't use Athlon specific
opcodes then that should speed things along on a K6-2 or K6-3 too.
Other areas that may benefit 3dnow! optimisations?
checksumming routines? String functions ?
regards,
Dave.
