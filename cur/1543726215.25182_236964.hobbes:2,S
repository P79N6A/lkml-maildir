Not quite with this thread and in this stage of development, but this is
quite possible if certain concurrency problems are solved in Linux. RCU is
a potential pain as well as other things. BSD/OS-FreeBSD-current are not
new to this kind of conversion, so this is certainly very possible with
very finite software engineering problems to solve. 
Scary ain't it ? It makes me wonder some times.
