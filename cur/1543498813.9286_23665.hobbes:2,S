(i) The info part: this magic 0xC0ED flag was added in 0.96c-patch1
(thus in 1992, not 1994).
(ii) The opinion part: removing the test for 0xC0ED will give us
16 more flag bits to be used with the mount system call.
No doubt people will find use for those.

Do you still have a clean MCC distribution?
[I collect this old stuff but not many people seem to have these things
any longer. Have a machine that still runs TAMU on a 0.99pl13k kernel.
Some months ago when people made some effort to find kernel sources,
not a single new kernel source surfaced. In particular, nobody seems
to have the 0.99pl13X kernels for X != k.]
