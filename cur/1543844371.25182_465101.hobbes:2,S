the reason why i added desched_thread was not because it's "more right" 
to do this from a separate context, but simply because the resource 
freed by it is not being freed via RCU by the upstream kernel. If that 
resource (mm_struct) were freed by RCU we'd have its rt-friendly 
reapdown "for free" and no desched_thread would be needed at all.
