I'd like to point out that the DRI was designed with SGI (and other
non-Intel) hardware in mind, and that the design can support implicit
locking mechanisms using page faulting.
We have implemented the current version of the DRI with an explicit
cooperative lock because that is required on today's PC-class hardware.
However, if a page-fault mechanism is found to be desirable on some
hardware, the currently implemented DRI can still provide a very
significant part of the overall infrastructure needed to support direct
rendering -- the changes required would involve the kernel driver, and the
removal of the explicit locking code from the X server and the
direct-rendering client.
Selecting and implementing a synchronization mechanism is only one small
part of the direct-rendering infrastructure provided by the DRI -- more
information is available on
