Well, it looks like you're getting hit with stream.c or raped.c and what
I'm passing on is just what I picked up from a CERT guy at Usenix.  He
claimed that stream.c worked by exploiting a long path through the kernel
to bring the machine to its knees.
Dave Dittrich has a bunch of information (which I should probably read) on
these attacks here:
