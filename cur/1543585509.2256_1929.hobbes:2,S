The host ID is the network IP address in network order, displayed
as a hexadecimal number.
The program, `hostid`  first looks in /etc/hostid.
If no such file exists, it resolves the host IP address and
uses it, but not as the typical dotted-quad. Instead, it uses
hex in network order.
IP address 204.178.40.224
0xb2cce028

It has nothing to do with the kernel. If you are properly networked,
the hostid will be unique in your LOCAL network.
