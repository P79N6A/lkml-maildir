Hi,
I have seen a few threads about unfixed kernel regression lately. I
strongly believe that many kernel developers and users could help
pinpointing the cause of those bugs much more efficiently by using a
tool like LTTng.
If you want to find the code I just released (both for -mm inclusion and
as a RFC) tied up in a single tarball, you will find the patchset at the
beginning of the LTTng series file there :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/patch-2.6.24-rc2-git3-lttng-0.10-pre24.tar.bz2
This LTTng "pre" version can be used with the following userspace packages :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/ltt-control-0.46-06112007.tar.gz
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/lttv-0.10.0-pre2-07112007.tar.gz
Mathieu
