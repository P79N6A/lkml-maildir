Hi again all,
 On my laptop's VIA82C686 bios, if I reboot with Linux, the machine
doesn't boot up properly.  It gives me a keyboard error, among other
things.  This happens with kernel 2.4.7, 2.4.12, and 2.4.13 (which, btw,
now seems to work fine, tho I haven't tested it much - I think there may
have been something in the -ac branch that was making it die before).
 However, on 2.4.9, it works fine.  I reboot, and the computer comes
back up OK.  Same if I rebooted from WindowsXP.
 How the frick can I debug this one?
Sean Etc.
