OK, offset 0x8C Host Bus Power Management Control has
(VT8235, but 8237 is same I think):
bit 0 Internal Clock Stop During Suspend (default 0)
bit 1 Internal Clock Stop During C3 (default 0) [internal PCI clock]
bit 2 Internal Clock Stop for PCI Idle (default 0)
[stop PCI clock when PCKRUN# high]
This wouldn't have anything whatsoever to do with my ACPI ""C2""
BIOS headaches, I assume??
Probably my BIOS has some of those bits tweaked to 1,
need to fiddle with pciutils a bit...
Somehow I'm getting the impression that we should have been
rewarding the BIOS with indifference all the time already in Linux,
given how *very useful* those chipset registers are...
Argh.
Burn ACPI, EFI, Real Mode, ..., let's go back to basics. :-P
