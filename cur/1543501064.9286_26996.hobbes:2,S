	That actually sounds like a most-excellent feature to me. :)  Why
is this needed to be done in kernel-space, anyhow?  Sounds very user-level.
Perhaps a well-written library would suffice...

	I would disagree w/ that, actually.  Many think that now because of
Micro$oft, that doesn't mean it's the most optimal way of doing it.  Besides,
there are tarballs, and you could just have your code able to understand a
tarball.

	This doesn't seem very likely, at least not to me... :)
