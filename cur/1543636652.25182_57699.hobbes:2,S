Been using 2.4.19-rc1-aa2 on a fairly large x86 box for about 16 days
now. Nothing but love. Using the 0/1 scheduler, though I'm not sure if I
could tweak it for "better" performance.(hint: like to see some
"best-practices" type of doc, for 4/8-way SMP boxen)
Aside from that, I've got 8GB ram, a ~750GB Oracle instance running, and
4GB SHMMAX attatched to some Copper FC1 disks and using QLA2200's. 
It's been very happy since rc1. Anyway, it's worth a shot. As soon as
2.4.19 is "done" this box will go into production as soon as this RC2 VM
stuff is cleared up.
