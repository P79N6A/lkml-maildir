The kernel was built with 'egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)',
which is what SUSE comes with.
What type of video card do you have?  I'm getting desparate here.  From
a tip from Alan Cox, I last night tried running X with "option noaccel",
but it still crashed.  Any other ideas?  I'm willing to try just about
anything.  I'm going to try the absolute latest X server tonight.
