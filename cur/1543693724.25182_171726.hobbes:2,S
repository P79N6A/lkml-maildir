The ethernet and wireless driver where never linked into the kernel. So it
should be okay if they only distribute the module. They decided to provide
object code. Which is far better than a linked the module. I'm aware of the
current discussion wether binary modules are legal or not. The main Linksys
case was about the GPL violation by linking stuff into the kernel. _That_ is
resolved now. The wireless driver is a completely different story. IMHO.
