The oops is caused by this code in kmem_cache_free:
#if 1
/* FORCE A KERNEL DUMP WHEN THIS HAPPENS. SPEAK IN ALL CAPS. GET THE CALL CHAIN. */
*(int *) 0 = 0;
#endif
There should be kmem_alloc: ... message directly in front of the oops
in the kernel log. what does it say? 
As far as I can see the problem can only happen when a process in the
process list carries a bogus pointer in tsk->mm. The new locking in
array.c has the side effect of noticing it in mmput.
