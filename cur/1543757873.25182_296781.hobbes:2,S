While working on a driver for z85230 based board I noticed what looks 
like it could be a problem. If the interrupt handler is handling an 
interrupt on port b and an interrupt comes in for port a, it seems to me 
that the port b handler would be called instead of the port a handler, 
and possibly hang the board until reset.
Attached is a patch to set the irq methods back to port a before 
attempting to call them.
Cheers,
 Tom.
