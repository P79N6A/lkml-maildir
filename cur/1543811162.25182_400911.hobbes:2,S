Subject: [patch] x86_64: don't use early_printk() during memory init
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

printk is working by the time this memory init message prints.
As it stands, output jumps to the top of the screen and prints
this message, then back to normal boot messages, overwriting
a line at the top.
