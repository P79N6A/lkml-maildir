Not sure how many AMD 8111 based systems are out there which are
upgradeable to Barcelona.
I guess the BIOS won't setup MCFG for systems with 8111/8131 
because both lack ECS MMIO Base Address Register. 
(Because 8111 and 8131 are not Mode2-PCI-X and PCI-express
capable.)
So if such a board is upgradeable, the way to access extended
config space of the northbridge functions is to use CF8/CFC
ECS access.

Andreas
