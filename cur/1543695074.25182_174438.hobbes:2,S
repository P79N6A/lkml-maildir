Well, one of the bugs seems to be that people just didn't like the
approach, while udev's approach is lean and mean and people do seem to
approve of it. That's a matter of taste. And Greg's attitude is also
more likable at parties ;-)
I do believe that this is one of the main reasons, and arguing about
taste is kind of pointless. Style has always been an important matter in
designing maintainable systems and code, and if the gut feeling of the
majority of kernel developers tells them this is the way to go, then so
it will be done. *shrug*
