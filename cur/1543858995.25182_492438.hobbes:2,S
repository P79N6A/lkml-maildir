Hello,
I'm using uswsusp and with commit
	3592695c363c3f3119621bdcf5ed852d6b9d1a5c
	uswsusp: add pmops->{prepare,enter,finish} support (aka "platform mode")
My PC power-light starts flashing during s2disk as expected (comment
from the commit that fixes the same thing in in-kernel suspend):
"    [PATCH] swsusp: fix platform mode
    At some point after 2.6.13, in-kernel software suspend got "incomplete" for
    the so-called "platform" mode.  pm_ops->prepare() is never called.  A
    visible sign of this is the "moon" light on thinkpads not flashing during
    suspend.  Fix by readding the pm_ops->prepare call during suspend."
BUT: another thing that happens is that now my PC powers itself on
_without_ pressing the power button (just by plugging the AC power).
I don't like this all that much...
I understand this is probably MOBO specific but, is this behaviour
expected/common?
