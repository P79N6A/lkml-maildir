*nods* It doesn't seem to depend on the equipment at the far end of the link,
so I'm guessing it's a local problem. The modem here is part of a 3Com
"Etherlink III LAN+33.6 Modem PC Card" (that's PCMCIA to you and me). cardmgr
identifies it as "3Com 3c562/3c563 Ethernet/Modem" and insmods 3c589_cs.o
and serial_cs.o. So I guess the question is hardware problem (modem), software
problem (driver), or wetware problem (me configuring something wrong <g>)?
