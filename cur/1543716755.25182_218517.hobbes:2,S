The NVidia users will also have to back out the regparm patch, or insert
'asmlinkage' on all the appropriate definitions in the glue code.  Note that
the patches on www.minion.de already fix this for the 5341 drivers as of
03/24/2004.
In any case, even though I'm one of those NVidia users, I'm OK with the
patch being in there - anybody who's clued enough to build and run a -mm
kernel shouldn't have much trouble figuring out how to build it with 2 patches
reverted.
