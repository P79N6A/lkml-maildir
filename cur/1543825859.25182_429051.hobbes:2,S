It just didn't make much sense, a config option only to configure the 
default value of unseen values?
If we have too many debug options, I don't mind to hide them behind an 
advanced config option, but their default values should not differ between 
their visible and hidden state, so that the user sees the real values when 
he enables the advanced option.
A config option which only configures the default values is much less 
useful, in an already configured kernel it's completely useless to an user 
who only wants to enable some runtime checks and unless he reads the help 
text _carefully_, he might even think that he just enabled some runtime 
checks. AFAIC such stuff is NACKed.
bye, Roman
