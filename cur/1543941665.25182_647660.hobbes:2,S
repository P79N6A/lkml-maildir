I understand your point.

I have two reasons why I'd like to let it be a module:
- it's "broken", the relay buffers are cleared on module unload
- it's a lot easier to push updated version for testing to people
Ok, the first one is just a silly excuse, but the second one is to
avoid forcing non-developer users to patch their kernels. This is a
much needed tool for the Nouveau project even in it's current form.

And this was the third reason I wanted a module, but I understand this
is an unacceptable justification.
What are these "othes cases" I could look at as an example of a hook,
that is meant for a single specific module? I do not understand what
could prevent out-of-tree modules from using the hook if my module can
use it (and my module is not using it at the same time).
What is the verdict?
Will the custom page fault handler patch v2 get merged as it is,
do I need to modify it (how?), do I need to rewrite it based on
some example (which?), or do I have to drop the whole idea of
mmiotrace being kernel module and make it work as built-in?
In the case of making it a built-in, I do not think I have any
chance to get it done for 2.6.25.
There's one more option. I could make kmmio.c things as builtin,
and keep the mmio-mod.c as the module. This is how things were in
the very beginning of mmiotrace, when the page fault notifiers did
not exist. This could be an acceptable compromise, no?
But I don't think I will get that ready for 2.6.25, either.
What about merging the custom page fault handler patch now, and
removing it for 2.6.26?
Looks like Beulich and Roskin will be disappointed anyway. They
were hoping for a usable page fault hook.
