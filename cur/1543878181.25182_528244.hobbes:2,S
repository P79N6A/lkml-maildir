You're ignoring reality. It has more to do with signals than with 
processes. Look at *all* the fields in the top half of the structure, up 
to (and including) the "tty" field. They're *all* about signal semantics 
in one form or another (whether it's directly about shared signal 
behaviour, or indirectly about *sources* of signals like process control 
or timers).
And renaming it really has no upsides, even *if* you had a point, which 
you don't.
