Not needed, can be adjusted from user space, once /sys is mounted.
echo -n 30 >/sys/class/firmware/timeout
The firmware class driver just provides a sane default, nothing else.
If this becomes a very common case (many drivers having big firmware
and userspace needs a lot of time providing it), your patch should go in.
But then the _default_ is wrong for many users.
