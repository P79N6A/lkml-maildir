Yes this is why I originally replied to the post... but he's not using a PIIXx at
all,
but the IDE chip on an Intel 815 motherboard.  I'm not sure if they use the same
driver
, but I don't think so.

this is false.  They may differ by partition, since different parts (zones) of a
modern disk have different recording densities and therefore transfer rates.
IBM's spec sheet says rates vary from 15MB/sec to 31MB/sec... it he's seeing
15MB/sec, maybe he should try the other end of the disk.  can you verify this?
try hdparm -t /dev/hda1 instead of hda5 (if those are on opposite ends of the
disk)
include output of fdisk so we can see partition layout, and results of hdparm on
different areas.

please show us your partition table.
