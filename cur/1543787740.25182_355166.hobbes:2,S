The comment made sense for the prototype at the header, but the function 
now has only one caller in the file where it's defined.
If someone needs a comment to figure out what a function whose complete 
contents is
static struct gss_api_mech *
gss_mech_get(struct gss_api_mech *gm)
{
        __module_get(gm->gm_owner);
        return gm;
}
does, the problem is not a missing comment.
