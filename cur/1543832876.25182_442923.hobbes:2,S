Well yes of course, but what characteristics? The manual only lists
 0, 0.90, default
        Use the original 0.90  format  superblock.   This  format
        limits  arrays to 28 componenet devices and limits compo■
        nent devices of levels 1 and greater to 2 terabytes.
 1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
        Use the new version-1 format superblock.   This  has  few
        restrictions.    The   different   subversion  store  the
        superblock at different locations on the  device,  either
        at  the  end (for 1.0), at the start (for 1.1) or 4K from
        the start (for 1.2).
No 0.91 :(
(My mdadm is 2.2, but the problem remains in 2.5.2)
