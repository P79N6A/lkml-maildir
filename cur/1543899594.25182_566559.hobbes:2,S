how does that behave when:
 a) the parent dies and gets reaped?
 b) the 'spawned' init dies, but other tasks
    inside the pid space are still active?
 c) what visibility rules do apply for the
    various spaces (including the default host space)?

interesting ... not sure that is what kernel folks
have in mind though (IIRC, the struct pid change was
considered a kernel side cleanup)

shouldn't that be done by userspace instead?
