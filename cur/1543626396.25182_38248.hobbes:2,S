Is there still someone developing the Ati Rage Pro agp driver for VESA? When I
compile my kernel (2.4.17) with this driver set to Y the console gets all corny. Letters disappears and reappears, the update frequency is extremely low, and the
text gets all dazed and flickers. It doesn't matter which mode I give to lilo,
the problem persists.
I tried to contact the autor a while ago, without success. 
The VESA Frame buffer driver works perfectly.
