Wrong criteria:
The real test is
Can XYZ evil bastard with the source code construct a non setuid application
that causes the absolute worst case behaviour and deadlocks or crashes the
machine.
As I understand it now the answer to that is yes - for reiser, xfs and ext3
(in fact more so for ext3 than the others)
Its a bad idea to ship code with a hard to fix problem that may pop up on
bugtraq a month later..
