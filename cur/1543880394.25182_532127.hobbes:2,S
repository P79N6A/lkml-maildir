Since the patches are going into apm.c and apm was used for suspend and 
poweroff before ACPI was a feature of the hardware, I assume there's a 
relationship. As of 2.6.9 ACPI still couldn't power down one of my old 
boxes, it hasn't been updated since that time, so I can't say what later 
kernels will do.
