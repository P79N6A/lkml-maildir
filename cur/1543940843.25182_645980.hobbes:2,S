So far I have only seen three persons being really active in fixing the
section mismatch bugs. And thats Randy, Adrian and myself.
Granted a few other have done some sporadic efforts in their
area of interest but nothing covering the tree as a whole.
And most isssues are easy fixable - I would estimate less than
half an hour in average for the fixes Adrian posted today.
There are some tricky corners that are dfficult to deal with
but I have not seen these occur in drivers.
It is mostly when we mix assembler and C plus
some of the core functionality.
The hotplug cpu stuff for example look scary and here
I may try to road you propose but for the hotplug stuff
I think it is worth it.
