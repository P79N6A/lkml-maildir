Better would be to fix smp_send_stop than to work around it for this
very limited case. I've been running into this with machine checks
too. The new fancy smp_call_function() that is there now just doesn't
work in any unusual situation like early boot or fatal exceptions,
My thinking was to use a separate vector, or possible just the NMI.
