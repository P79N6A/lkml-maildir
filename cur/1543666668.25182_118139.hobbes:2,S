2.5.65-mm1 seems to work fine on my up office machine.
Using devfs is no problem with debian unstable/testing.
No config files needed to be changed compared to "normal" devfs.
Three files needed changing compared to plain old  non-devfs:
/etc/fstab:   use /dev/discs/disc0/partX instead /dev/hdaX
/etc/gpm:     use mouse device /dev/input/mouse0 instead of /dev/psaux
/etc/inittab: Specify vc/X instead of ttyX for getty. X came up even
without this.
