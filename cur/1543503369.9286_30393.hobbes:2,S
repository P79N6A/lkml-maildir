I personally feel that all the (reasonably small) CPU workarounds should be
in the kernel, but I seem to have lost that battle. The idea that all the
distributions are going to include start-up scripts which grep /proc/cpuinfo
and run set6x86 accordingly is ludicrous wishful thinking IMHO.
To address your first point, I think the f00f bugfix has to be kernel space.
It seems to mess with mm things (does this indicate how little I understand
about it? :)

Note that there are two different techniques for working around the bug:
	- set the NO_LOCK bit in CR<whatever>; can cause problems in obscure
	  circumstances (Alan mentioned a graphics / accelerator card problem)
	- do some undocumented magic provided by (or reverse engineered from)
	  Cyrix, that seems to modify the CPU behaviour when executing the
	  offending instruction, making to do a noop afterwards. I don't know
	  of any problems caused by this.
