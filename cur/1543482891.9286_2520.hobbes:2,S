I don't think we should do that here. Linux-kernel already
has far too much traffic. I'd be happy to set up a mailing
list for that purpose, however.
If I get at least 5 people in favor of such a list, I'll
immediately create linux-wish@nl.linux.org (or kernel-devel
or some other, better name).

One of the ways in which the 2.3 cycle can be shorter is
by only integrating stuff that's already being worked on
and is ready by the time 2.3.0 is forked off. Then we
integrate all those things within 5 revisions and start
debugging. Maybe we even want to distribute all of those
things in one big patch _before_ 2.3.0 is forked off.
Anyway, the last thing we should do is keeping Linus from
his far-more-important 2.2 work...
