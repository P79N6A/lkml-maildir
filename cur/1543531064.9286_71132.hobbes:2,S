Equally, HOW does the user see that choice - bearing in mind all their
processes may be suspended? Do you try to guarantee their shell can
display and respond to some kind of prompt without allocating any
memory or stack space? How do you know the user is even logged in?
Finally, what choice do you give them - "Please enter the PID of the
process you want killed"?

No. That is NOT overcommit. Overcommit, in this context, is when a
process calls malloc() and is given unpopulated address space, which
will be populated on use.
This does not affect overcommit at all. What it DOES do is restrict
OOM conditions to individual users, rather than systemwide - but at
the expense of massive restrictions on what the users can do.
Completely impractical for most environments - OK, it makes your job
easier (you don't have to deal with runaway processes etc.) - but it
will probably cost you that job anyway, when they find out you have
hindered use of the facility so seriously.
