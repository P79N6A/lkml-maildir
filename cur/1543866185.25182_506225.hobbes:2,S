If the scroll lock is on and there is a bunch of console output, the machine
will eventually stop responding to the network, until scroll lock is turned
off (at sometimes that doesn't even help). 
Easy test:
hit scroll lock
do a few echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger on that machine from a ssh/telnet session
and it should stop responding after two or three of them.
This is bad (for me) because we have a stupid switch box that uses scroll
lock to bring up the system selection menu, so sometimes scroll lock gets
left on by accident, and the machine eventually locks up.
