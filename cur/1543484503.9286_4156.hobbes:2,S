100 Megabit Token-Ring. This is BRAND NEW, I just got a few of the cards
in this week for some machines, and the drivers that ship with the crad
for Windows/OS2/etc are the ones that have only been up on teh website
since december, I suspect these cards hit the market at the beginning of
the year. I'm dying to try the 100Mbit. Basic scoop is that they will do
100mbit over Cat 5. About time IBM delivered on their promises of 100Mbit.
