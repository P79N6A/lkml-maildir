Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people use the distro-provided
precompiled kernels. This is only a danger to people who insist on
compiling their own kernels but who don't know enough to investigate
things labeled "EXPERIMENTAL" before typing Y.
IMHO, these people are a dying breed since modern distros seem to do a
good job at preventing problems that drive ordinary users to compile
their own kernels in the first place. IMHO, it's reasonable to expect
the small minority of Linux users who want to compile their own kernels
to learn that "EXPERIMENTAL" means something.
Cheers,
Eric
