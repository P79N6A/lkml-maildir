I'm running SMP with 2 pros on a supermicro board. In the past on 2.1 - I
had crashes preceded by spurious APIC interrupts. It ran for a while
however if I used  a "noapic" boot message.
This version gives no spurious APIC but locks up the keyboard in 10 minutes
or so. Running noapic it crashes before the day is over.
The system runs stably on 2.0.36
