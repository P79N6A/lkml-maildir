Subject: UDMA with Toshiba Host Bridge? (1179:0601 - 460CDT)

Hello,
I have this Toshiba Laptop here (a Satellite Pro 460CDT) that seems to be using a toshiba chipset instead of your garden variety intel/via/... chipset. It's running a bit sluggish, and the only thing I can really pinpoint is that it's not using UDMA for it's HD IO.
Now I was wondering if some kind soul ever whipped up a patch to support this specific chipset somewhere? I'm not sure if (accurate/complete) specs are available, the only thing I found was this page: 
http://linux.toshiba-dme.co.jp/linux/eng/develop.php3
I know it's an old machine, but I'd like to get some life out of it still if possible. 
Oh, and can anyone tell me exactly if mdma2 is really as slow as I think it is (compared to udma)? 
Thanks,
-- Mourad
