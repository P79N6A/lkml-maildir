In a private mail to someone I have came up with a similar system for
capabilities using an indexed array, but constructed in a bit different way.
Below is a part of the mail that describes my idea. Maybe it makes a bit
sense to implement it that way?
-----------------
We define capability bits as an array of, up to, 256 entries. As the
capabilities are stored per-process, we have to preserve space and thus
limit the actual number of array slots to some necessary count. Now, the
individual capability is assigned a 32-bit value that looks like this:
bit(s)           meaning
------------------------
31-8             a bitmask that uniquely identifies the capability
7-0              array slot 'selector'
This gives us a potential of max 24*256 capabilities (assuming that the
array is that of 32-bit words, I chose a common value for all the
platforms). In every slot 8 bits are "wasted" - they can be used by the code
to further tune the access rights to given _capability_ or used for any
other purpose that comes into mind. Such defined capabilities give us 256
potential "classes" of capabilities. For example, selectors (classess) 0 -
16 are the kernel-specific capabilities, other classes left for imagination
and registration. Kernel uses a mask for the selector part of capability, so
that bounds checking is performed - the arrays are as large as it is needed.
------------------
This doesn't cover filesystem capabilities storage, but I guess the
"resource inode" approach would be the best for this kind of implementation.
