Hi,
Here is a patchset implementing a more lockdep-friendly solution to make lockdep
happy with configfs.
The first patch could probably be cleaner, but first let's see if the
approach is ok.
I don't have a good setup to test the second patch beyond compilation, but I
guess that Joel has one :)
So, does it look better?
Louis
