Hmm, I might've missed previous discussion regarding this, but I'm
curious to know why using statically allocated kobjects is "naughty".
The code / warnings / printk messages below indicate this is only a
"silly/janitorial" issue?
The reason I ask is that if it is serious, there is no reason why this
check cannot be done at build-time itself, instead of this runtime
kludge in the kernel -- catching potential bugs at build-time is always
desirable. Modpost or some such tool can be taught to detect kobjects
allocated statically in vmlinux/modules -- or there can be other build-
time solutions, possibly. Have you considered such an approach?
Thanks,
Satyam
