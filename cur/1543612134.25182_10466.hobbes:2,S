You have 3Gb of virtual space for an application on x86. This is basically
hardware limitations of the processor (1Gb is used for kernel mappings and
having kernel and user mappings overlapping costs every syscall)
If you are hitting a 1GB limit I would assume the jvm isn't very bright
about its allocation of resources. You should run out at something like
2.5Gb of allocations. (you lose some to app and library maps)
