I now implemented some basic aggregation per-arch and per-branch but I'm
not yet merging in the same row kernels with only a different
localversion (example: 2.6.13-ppc64 isn't merged with 2.6.13). The
problem is that the localversions may be random and so it complicates
things as said above (it'd be really nice to have a way to identify the
localversion reliably). Suggestions are welcome. Thanks.
