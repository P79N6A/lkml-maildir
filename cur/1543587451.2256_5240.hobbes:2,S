I once ran into a problem with 32-byte errors appearing in files, and
later, in memory.  I eventually traced it to buggy motherboard cache.
(32 bytes is the size of a cache line.)  A memory tester might be
something to try (I wrote a simple program that seemed to show the
error better than memtest86; can send it if desired.)
