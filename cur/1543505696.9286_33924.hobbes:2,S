     Yep. I mailed them as well and got the same reply. To me it
     sounds like: "We are not going to write a Linux driver unless 
     hordes of screaming customers tell us to do so right now, so
     bugger off!"
     When I pressed the matter further by asking about the 
     availability of the specifications so that I could start 
     working on a driver myself, the answer was blunt: "sorry, 
     they are classified. you'll have to wait until the drivers
     are ready." 
     I've understood that the decryption of the DVD-signal is 
     handled on the hardware level so encryption cannot be the 
     reason for them to withhold the card's programming specs.
     Petition time, anyone?
