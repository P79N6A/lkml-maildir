Hi,
today I tried to do the following three things at once:
* play a mp3 using x11amp;
* transfer files to a parallel ZIP drive;
* rip a CD track using cdparanoia.
I was running XFree 3.3.3 + KDE 1.1.
The system totally hung, even SAK couldn't tell it to stop. It was
apparently trying to do something with the ZIP, since the orange light on
the ZIP was flashing in a repeating pattern. Ejecting the ZIP cartridge
didn't help. I was forced to power-cycle the machine (then manual fsck).
Configuration:
* sound card = ISA PnP ESS1868
* kernel = 2.2.1 + PCI patch for UMC8886BF
* CD-Rom = ATAPI
* ZIP: newer parallel ZIP, using the imm driver found in 2.2.1.
Regards,
David
