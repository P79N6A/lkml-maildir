I've checked the kernel logs and was unable to find anything
suspicious.  This does not seem to happen on vanilla, its a mm only
issue.
The device becomes a regular file, and udev seems to forget about it..
even if I replug in the device, udev will not touch this file.  It
also seems to have trouble recreating the node even when the file has
been deleted
Hope that helps, 
Joe
