Actually, I think it would make the kernel (negligibly) faster to bump
f_pos before the vfs_write() call.  Unless fget_light sets fput_needed
or the write doesn't complete cleanly, you won't have to touch the
file table entry again after vfs_write() returns.  You can adjust
vfs_write to grab f_dentry out of the file before going into
do_sync_write.  do_sync_write is done with the struct file before it
goes into the aio_write() loop.  Result: you probably save at least an
L1 cache miss, unless the aio_write loop is so frugal with L1 cache
that it doesn't manage to evict the struct file.
Patch to follow.
Cheers,
- Michael
