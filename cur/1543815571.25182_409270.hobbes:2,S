Looks good. Just some minor grammar comments
+ * The power management timer may return improper result when read.
Change to "may return an improper result" or "may return improper results"
+                       printk(KERN_WARNING
+                              "* Found PM-Timer Bug on this chip. For 
workarounds a bug, this timer\n"
+                              "* source is slow. Other timer source may be 
proper (clock=)\n");
Change "Other timer source may be proper" to "Consider trying other timer 
sources"
+                      "* This chipset may have PM-Timer Bug, For workarounds 
a bug,\n"
+                      "* this timer source is slow. If you are sure, please 
use \"pmtmr_good\"\n"
+                      "* for disabling the workaround\n");
Change "For workarounds a bug" to "Due to workarounds for a bug"
Change "If you are sure" to "If you are sure your timer does not have this 
bug"
Change "for disabling the workaround" to "to disable the workaround"
Cheers,
Con
