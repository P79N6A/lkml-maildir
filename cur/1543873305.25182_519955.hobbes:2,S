Under Xen, the pagetables are mapped read-only to the guest, so all
pagetable updates need to go via the hypervisor.  If we switch to
init_mm and unpin (make all the pages RW) before pulling the pagetable
apart, then we can just traverse and modify the pagetable memory as
normal RW memory.  It avoids a heap of traps into the hypervisor.
