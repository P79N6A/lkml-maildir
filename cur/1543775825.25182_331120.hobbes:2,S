Jens,
	Yes, I know about laptop_mode, I always use it, but HD APS does not
automatically starts laptop_mode currently. That's why I was spitting out
that it could be a good idea to kick something like laptop_mode or
laptop_mode if normall vibration is detected, and then if higher vibration
or tilting numbers are detected, then park the head.
	If you check the IBM software in Windows, it shows 2 things. First, when it
pauses the HD and when it stops the HD. It all depends on how hard you hit
the PC. In one we suspend the drive and in the other we park the drive.
