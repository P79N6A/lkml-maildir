I do not think it can throw a meaningful warning. After all, whether
dereferencing and writing to a char* actually touches
(a) rw memory
(b) ro memory
(c) rw memory which we'd like to be ro ;-)
is not known to the compiler. Of course, one may add more complicated
code to cover simple cases like the one in suncore.c, but that may
as well just gives us more can't-figure-out-correctly-on-my-own warnings
like "possible uninitialized value used" (int n; set_n(&n); use_n(n);) /
where adding more code to cover all detectable cases increases complexity
too much.
