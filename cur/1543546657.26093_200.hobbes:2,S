Hi,
		I'm looking at drivers trying to fix some issues related to resource
allocation, getting rid of not needed panics, etc, when I saw this in
drivers/char/pcwd.c:
                if (card_status & WD_T110) {
                        printk("pcwd: Card senses a CPU Overheat.  Panicking!\n");
                        panic("pcwd: CPU Overheat.\n");
                }
Shouldn't it try to turn of the machine (APM, etc) or use machine_restart?
panic would just generate more heat 8) Ok, the admin can set a panic_timeout,
but in this case maybe it would be better to have a safer default policy, what
do you think?
                        - Arnaldo
