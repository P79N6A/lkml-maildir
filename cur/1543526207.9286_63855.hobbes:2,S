Fair enough so far. It's from here on that things go wrong.

Which user's screen should that dialogue appear on? Remember, the
process most likely to access floppies is the one that flushes dirty
buffers to disk - `updated` if my memory's correct - and it's unlikely
it will have any clue here.
Remember: On a multi-user system like Linux, the user that removed the
floppy could easily NOT be the user that was writing to it.

Same question: WHich user should be notified?

They have one BIG advantage over the facility under discussion: They
do NOT need to interact with any user to do their work.
Best wishes from Riley.
