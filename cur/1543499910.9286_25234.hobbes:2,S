Yes, and when your kernel goes crazy that you certainly can not afford
to wait 3 hours.
People tend to do stupid things. How many times did you crash your
machine? Imagine you would have to wait _3 hours_ after each crash. No
no.
Certainly machines with 100G disks have UPSes. But shit happens: I've
seen fuse failing _after_ UPS. 
And: 100G is not that much any more. When you buy new computer today
(not lowend), you get 10G disk. Take ten of them and you have 100G. It
is not much!
You see? If you only take 10 computers you have 100G of disk space!
100G is not much space any more.
