I have trouble accessing a CD-ROM via my SCSI Plextor CD, connected
to a Tekram DC390 (AM53C974 driver).
When I try to mount it, I get this error:
	mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/scd0,
		   or too many mounted file systems
and in the logs:
	VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)
	attempt to access beyond end of device
	0b:00: rw=0, want=688290, limit=203728
	isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=0b:00, iso_blknum=344144, block=344144
When I do the SAME mount on my IDE CD, same machine, it works, and the logs
say:
	VFS: Disk change detected on device ide0(3,64)
	scanning for RockRidge behind XA attribute
	last message repeated 38 times
and I can then access the CD-ROM.
This is a picture CD-ROM burned by a shop in France (FNAC, in case there
are other french readers).
With VMWare running on the same machine, when I connect the IDE CD-ROM to
the virtual machine, I can read the CD, but partially.  Some directories
are missing.  So the CD-ROM is not "clean" -- I suspect the session is not
closed.
What troubles me is the different behaviour between the SCSI CD-ROM and the
IDE one.  Any explaination?
