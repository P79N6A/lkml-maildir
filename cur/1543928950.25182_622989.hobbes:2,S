Actually, I think you're right.  I think the problem is that:
        if (uaddr != MTD_UADDR_NOT_SUPPORTED ) {
                /* ASSERT("The unlock addresses for non-8-bit mode
                   are bollocks. We don't really need an array."); */
                uaddr = finfo->uaddr[0];
        }
Should be:
        if (uaddr == MTD_UADDR_NOT_SUPPORTED ) {
                /* ASSERT("The unlock addresses for non-8-bit mode
                   are bollocks. We don't really need an array."); */
                uaddr = finfo->uaddr[0];
        }
Otherwise the finfo->uaddr[] table is useless because only the first row will
be used, except for unsupported configurations where uaddr will be set to
MTD_UADDR_NOT_SUPPORTED.
With the ASB2303 bootprom I need to use the second row because it's in the x16
configuration, *not* the x8.
