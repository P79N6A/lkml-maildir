I have a second  joystickport build in and that run only if the mad16 deactivate the joystick port. If the joystickport on the soundcard is active both ports don't work. So my analog-joystick don't work. On an other soundcard(pnp) it works.
Two joystick ports can't work at once on the same i/o port. The default is 0x201. Standard
joystick cards only are on 0x201. MAD also only can use 0x201. MAD thus cannot live together
with another joystick card if its joystick port is enabled. Most PnP soundcards allow setting
an alternate joystick port address, so they can work.
