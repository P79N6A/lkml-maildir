Amen, brother. This pissed me off when it happened. I argued against
this sort of change. It took a fair bit of flaming before I realised
that the breakage was *deliberate*, rather than being a case of "it
will break things, but who cares"!
IIRC correctly, the rationale was to enforce filesystem authors to
make sure the flush() method was implemented/not implemented after
consideration. As I understood it, this new method wasn't relevant to
device drivers (someone correct me if this isn't the case).
However, there are far more device driver authors than filesystem
authors out there, so cracking the whip over a few filesystem authors
wounded a much larger group who didn't really need to know.
