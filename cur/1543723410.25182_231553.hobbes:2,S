I see absolutely nothing wrong in the data stream from your external
mouse, so... how is it configured in X{Free86|org}? What type is it?
Does it work in text console (with GPM)? What is your GPM setup?
Try this - in the text console do:
gpm -k
gpm -m /dev/input/mice -t ps2
Try working the mouse, is it good?
