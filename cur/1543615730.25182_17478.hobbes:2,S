    Which points up another dimension to this issue, that of "host
    controller v.s. drive electronics". 
    Most of the FW drives I've seen use a FW->IDE bridge and have IDE
    drives inside. This overcomes the biggest problem with IDE IMO, the
    limit of one (or two if you'll accept the performance degradation)
    drive per channel leading to lots of cables to fuss with. 
    I've got a 1.8T Exabyte disk box that has 24 IDE drives in it. It
    attaches to the host computer via FC.
