That's an interesting claim, however I don't think it holds. AA was
designed to mediate file access in a form which is intuitive to admins.
It's to be expected that it doesn't directly apply to mediating other
forms of access.

I seem to think that this is not what AA is trying to do, so evaluating
it in that context doesn't seem useful. It's like saying a screw driver
isn't a hammer, so it is useless because you have a nail.
