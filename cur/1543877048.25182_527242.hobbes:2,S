Ahh.... Seems that the first 4 bytes of the allocations is zapped after 
the object has been freed. Can you trap writes to the first four bytes of 
the object? This should give you the culprit.
The other thing is that the system is performing DMA allocations
for the file cache???? Then its running out of memory.
Argh.... We use  GFP DMA bitmask to check SLAB flags field:
Try this fix:
SLUB: Use correct flags to check for DMA cache
We use a GFP mask to check the SLAB flags if this is a DMA cache.
Fix this by using the correct SLAB mask and then use the SLUB_DMA
for the ORing of flags. If the system does not support DMA then
we will OR zero which will hopefully get the compiler to drop the
useless if statement as well.
