Subject: TCP push missing with writev()

(possibly treading on ground covered before:
 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9904.1/0304.html
 )
To be brief and to the point: Should there be any difference between the
following two ways of writing data to a TCP socket?
1) write( fd, buffer, length )
2) writev( fd, {buffer, length}, {NULL,0} )
The problem is that if data happens to be written via method (2), then
the PUSH flag is never set on any packets generated. This is a bug,
surely?
(Occurs on 2.2.5 and 2.4.0-test10. Doesn't occur in 2.0.36 and lots of
 other UNIX-alikes)
