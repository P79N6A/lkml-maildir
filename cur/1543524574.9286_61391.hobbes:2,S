Your shell changes it's current working directory, the xterm itself
doesn't.

As long as the directory is the current working directory of any
process it isn't unused. So you can't umount the file system.

man umount:
      -f     Force  unmount  (in case of an unreachable NFS sys­
              tem).  (Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)
