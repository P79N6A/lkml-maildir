That's great and will surely help most file systems (apparently not Coda as
Jan says they use 128 bit internal file identifiers).
What about 32 bit architectures? Is ino_t going to be 64 bit
there too?

Well, the NFS protocol allows that [see rfc1813, p. 21: "If two file handles from
the same server are equal, they must refer to the same file, but if they are not
equal, no conclusions can be drawn."]
As an example, some file systems encode hint information into the filehandle
and the hints may change over time, another example is encoding parent
information into the filehandle and then handles representing hard links
to the same file from different directories will differ.
