Correct me if I'm wrong, but the best way I know whether a file should
be treated as directory or as a file (atleast how I've implemented it)
depends upon the context (how the file is accessed) in the user-space
and this context is reflected in the kernel space in the flags of the
struct nameidata. So ...
----
        /* check if the archive is a path component or if last
component with slash */
	flags = (nd->flags & LOOKUP_CONTINUE) || (nd->flags & LOOKUP_DIRECTORY);
        if(flags)
               /* directory */
        else
               /* file */

No more worries! Am I missing something?
