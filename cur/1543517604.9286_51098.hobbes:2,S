Unfortunatly, the server I have trouble with is a production server, and
we don't have another HP LH4/NetRaid for testing.
I'm not sure your patch would catch *every* firmware problems.
What if the controller cache is badly written to disk(s) ?
It could give you back correctly your block from cache, but
