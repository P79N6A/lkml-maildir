And here are the excerpts from that page of the spec which are salient
to the present discussion:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The base configuration space of the AMD-8132 and PCI(-X) devices attached to it are accessible using only
the mechanism defined in PCI 2.3. Registers of PCI-X Mode 2 devices attached to the AMD-8132 in the
extended configuration space are not accessible. The AMD-8132 has no registers in the extended
