Some time ago, it was already discussed here that Rhythmbox would easily 
cause audio skipping when running with the CFS scheduler (http://
bhhdoa.org.au/pipermail/ck/2007-June/007886.html). It was said to be a 
Rhythmbox problem, for which someone needed to open a bug report. Well, I 
just did this, but the developer says he cannot reproduce this, and denies 
that Rhythmbox is making any X calls in its audio playback thread, so this 
bug is blocked for the moment.

It seems that there are people who know better what is wrong exactly. Can 
somebody give some more details about what Rhythmbox is doing wrong, 
either here, either in the bug ticket?
