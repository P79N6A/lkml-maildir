To be honest I have no idea why that's the case. One of the first things I 
did was eliminate the expired array and in my testing (up to 8x at osdl) I 
did not really notice this in and of itself made any big difference - of 
course this could be because the removal of the expired array was not done 
in a way which entitled starved tasks to run in reasonable timeframes.

/me looks in the schedstats peoples' way

Ah well I tuned the timeslice granularity and I can tell you it isn't quite 
what most people think. The granularity when you get to greater than 4 cpus 
is effectively _disabled_. So in fact, the timeslices are shorter in 
staircase (in normal interactive=1, compute=0 mode which is how martin 
would have tested it), not longer. But this is not the reason either since 
in "compute" mode they are ten times longer and this also improves 
throughput further.

Well from what I got on 8x the optimal load (-j x4cpus) and maximal load 
(-j) on kernbench gives surprisingly similar context switch rates. It's only 
when I enable compute mode that the context switches drop compared to 
default staircase mode and mainline. You'd have to ask Martin and Rick about 
what they got.
