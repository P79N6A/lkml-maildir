just a short question:
is -EAGAIN here really intentional? wouldn't -ENOMEM be better?
mm/mmap.c ~780 do_mmap_pgoff()
        /* mlock MCL_FUTURE? */
        if (vm_flags & VM_LOCKED) {
                unsigned long locked = mm->locked_vm << PAGE_SHIFT;
                locked += len;
                if (locked > current->rlim[RLIMIT_MEMLOCK].rlim_cur)
                        return -EAGAIN;
        }
TIA,
Herbert
