Ah ok. I checked the differences between the versions but there are too
many `none-standard' changes, i.e. kernel-language changes (statics,
inlines, __) etc so that I cannot submit a patch for the new version.
The good thing about the one on Luc's page it that it includes sysfs
support for several parameters and some more device ids.
Best wishes
Norbert

insisted the girl, `Do people want fire that can be fitted
