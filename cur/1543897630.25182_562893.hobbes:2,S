Have a look at how __d_path() is implemented (with the fixes): It takes the 
dcache_lock, and the vfsmount_lock where necessary, and this ensures that the 
pathname can't change under it, neither because of a rename nor unlink nor 
remount. The pathname computed is *exactly* the name the file has at that 
specific point time.
A few more details about how pathnames work are explained in the tech doc at:
