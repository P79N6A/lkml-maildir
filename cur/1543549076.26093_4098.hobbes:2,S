What about nfsd's "nfsservctl" syscall then? This appears to be modulable...
Anyway, I didn't mean using a random syscall number provided by the kernel
upon loading the module, but having one number preallocated for the purpose as
is done in knfsd.
Do you think, then, that I should be putting my stuff up for inclusion in the
kernel proper (say v2.5)? Or do you think I shouldn't be using a syscall at
all? Or should I just be offering it as a kernel patch that has to be applied
for use?
