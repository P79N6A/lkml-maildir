the goal now would be to simplify the test and work down the issues in
isolation, instead of looking at a complex setup of mixed workloads and
just seeing 'it sucks' without knowing which component causes what. 
That's why e.g. rtc_wakeup is so useful - it's simple and dependable and
still it showed a good deal of problems and helped debug/fix them.
