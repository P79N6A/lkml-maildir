Hi,
I ran a few more benchmarks on 2.4.0 final with 3.6.24.  The results were a 
little susprising (all on the same box, just after boot, no X):
	MB/s	user	system	cpu	time
3.6.24	 7.1	54.0	177,6	25%	14:57.5
3.6.24	14.5	53.2	152.4	47%	 7:15.7
3.6.24	 5.6	55.6	191.0	22%	18:36.4
reiserfs can do well, but notice how the system cpu seconds varies...
I am not seeing such wild differences in ext2 runs, impling that they
are due to something in reiserfs?
