It's a userland (and leaky, at that) LISP interpreter plus some glue and duct
tape to make it kinda-sorta work in kernel mode - enough for a demo, in any
case.  BTW, the LISP dialect implemented by that interpreter is unimpressive,
to put it mildly.  Even aside of atrocious "GC" and lexer (BTW, have the
author of RefLISP ever heard of arcane technics known as "checking the return
value of malloc"?), semantics of his EVAL would be a shame even in 70s (at
any point after Landin's papers, actually).  Sigh...
