I think we're safe here -- this is the _address_ of the pointer.
However, when dereferencing this address in _gang_lookup,
I think we do need rcu_dereference indeed.
Note that _gang_lookup_slot doesn't do this for us, however --
the caller must do that when dereferencing the pointer to the
item (eg. see page_cache_get_speculative in 2/3).
That said, I'm not 100% sure I have the rcu memory barriers in
the right places (well I'm sure I don't, given the _gang_lookup
bug you exposed!).
Thanks,
Nick
