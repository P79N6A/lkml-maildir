I agree with Jeff here - mostly because subverting the format is no
good, either.
In the future, or perhaps on other architectures, smp_num_siblings could
be per-processor.  So now we can extend this in the future and not break
the /proc interface.
Its just a by-product of the P4 that smp_num_siblings is global on
arch-i386.
