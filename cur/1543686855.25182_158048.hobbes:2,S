I knew it.  I knew it.
With a PS/2 keyboard, on a text console, only the yen and pipe key is
broken.  But with a USB keyboard, on a text console, the backslash and
underbar key is broken right along with the yen and pipe key.  These famous
two keys produce no input.
A few years ago I tried to persuade Andries Brouwer or Vojtech Pavlik to
accept a USB keyboard but they refused.  The patch which I sent to Vojtech
Pavlik was ignored and these two keys continued not to work (except on my
machine).  Finally Mike Fabian accepted a gift of a USB keyboard and this
defect in Linux got fixed.  But only for somewhere around the last half of
the 2.4 releases, not for 2.6.
What will it take this time?
