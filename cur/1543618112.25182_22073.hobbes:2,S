So your claim is that:
	Preemption improves latency when there are both kernel cpu bound
	tasks and tasks that are I/O bound with very low cache hit
	rates?
Is that it?
Can you give me an example of a CPU bound task that runs
mostly in kernel? Doesn't that seem like a kernel bug?

I still keep missing these reports. Can you help me here?
(Obviously "my laptop seems more effervescent" is not what I'm looking
 for.)
