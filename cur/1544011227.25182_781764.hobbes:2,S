ok, I get the idea, and I'm sorry for mis-prioritizing the things we
have to work on but it's not like I've been idling - as you're well
aware, we had a couple of nasty bugs in the past months which had to be
taken care of.
Anyways, I don't think it is too late yet for .29 since the merge window
is not open yet and I might whip up some patches in the next couple of
days...
