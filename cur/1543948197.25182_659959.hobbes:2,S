My paragraph above was aimed at the sync_file_range() case.  fsync and
fdatasync do the right thing within the limitations you brought up in
this thread.  sync_file_range() without further changes will only write
data pages, not the metadata required to actually access those data
pages.  This works just fine for non-COW filesystems, which covers all
currently merged ones.
With COW filesystems it is currently impossible to do sync_file_range()
properly.  The problem is orthogonal to your's, I just brought it up
since you were already mentioning sync_file_range().
