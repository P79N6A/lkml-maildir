Mike is a quick developer, I am trying to keep up with him.
Exactly, the MMR debug FS interface helps very much for developers and
customers.

The main reason I am not willing to submit this to mainline is the file
size. It's almost the biggest file in the kernel source. And it will be
bigger and bigger when more and more new Blackfin processors supported
by Linux kernel.
My suggestion is:
 - move the large MMR table to user space
 - add an interface of debug FS which let uses space app to send the large table to debug FS
 - debug FS will take care of the rest HW things according to each architecture. 
Or more deeper thought:
 - we don't need all the MMR setup at the same time for debugging. for example, maybe for some developer, he/she only needs one driver MMR for debugging such as watchdog/usb/spi/i2c ....
 - How about split the debug MMR table to each drivers or processors?
 - watchdog driver implements a debug FS interface for debugging watchdog MMR and other drivers implement their own things.
I am not familiar with UIO, is it easy interactive with debug FS?
Thanks
