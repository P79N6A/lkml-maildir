As to 1 (and 3), if you clone the processes (using the __clone - advanced
version of fork), you can specify what the processes should share. Including
memory. Thus you can also have threads (that share everything but stack) even
without a thread library (libpthread actualy does just that, but it has some
conveniece stuff like locks).
As of 2, avoid using ipc, especialy the sysv one - it's rather kind
of crap (IMHO).
