You're right (but please rediff against 2.4.22 when you send Marcelo).
You may wonder how this has taken so long to show up: because usually
drivers which mmap Reserved pages use remap_page_range on them,
and so never fault to do_no_page.
Which is the driver involved?  Though it's not wrong to give do_no_page
a Reserved page, beware of the the page->count accounting: while it's
Reserved, get_page or page_cache_get raises the count, but put_page
or page_cache_release does not decrement it - very easy to end up
with the page never freed.
