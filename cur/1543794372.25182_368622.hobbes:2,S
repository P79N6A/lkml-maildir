Subject: DMA mode locked off when via82cxxx ide driver built as module in 2.6.14

My HP ze1115 notebook uses the via82cxxx ide driver. If I configure the kernel build to make that driver as a module, the driver is correctly added to initrd and is loaded at boot time; however, DMA mode is turned off. It cannot be turned on even if I use an 'hdparm -d1 /dev/hda' command.
Is this a bug, or do I need some kind of IDE=XXX boot command? As expected, system performance in this mode is horrible.
