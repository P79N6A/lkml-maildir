As Christoph Hellwig pointed out, though the problem originally
surfaced as hangs with retry and 4G-4G, the fixes here are generic
and apply irrespective of 4:4.

This patch appears to fix the hangs seen with AIO and 4G-4G for me.  It
ensures that the indirect versions of copy_xxx_user are used during aio
retries running in worker thread context (i.e.  access aio issuer's
user-space instead of kernel-space).
