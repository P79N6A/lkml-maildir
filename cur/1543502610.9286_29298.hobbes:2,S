Well, since I've gotten this to happen twice now, I don't think it's an
isolated event anymore.  
Doing some development and using gdb to try to debug seems to be causing
some sort of kernel problem under 2.3.11-pre1.  When tracing a running
process, I get to the point where attempting to execute any command yields
the following.
	Trace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)
Attempts to login on other VCs cause the tty to respawn too fast and be
disabled.  Network logins also fail with the daemon never successfully
executing.  Anyone else a) experienced the same thing, or better yet b)
know what's the cause?  
gdb version is 4.17.0.11 (default RH6)
Registers are
EIP: 0010:[cpu_idle+65/84] EFLAGS: 00000246
EAX: 00000080 EBX: c0692000 ECX: c0692000 EDX: c0251bc0

Thanks,
