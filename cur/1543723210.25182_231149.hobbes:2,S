by 'system namespace' I mean the very first initial  hand-crafted
namespace.

Are you sure? I dont see it to be the case. I just verified it  on 2.6.7
/proc/<pid>/mounts is a file. However /proc/pid/root is a symbolic link 
to the root directory of the process. So the process with a cloned
namespace wont be able to access it through its namespace.

If this feature is available then great!
