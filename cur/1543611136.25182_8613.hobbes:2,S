i386, AFW-4300, 2.4.16, ieee1394 from kernel (not CVS , but soon CVS :)
)
Most problems resolved.
Now I'm working on a script to automount and autoumount the HD.
This is so fucking hard 'cause we are not aware of what user wants to
use the disk (for mount -o user to let the user accessing his datas in
rw mode). Another problem is the umount: if the directory s busy, my
script isn't able to du "cd .." for the user ...
so crazy
