this crash too seems to indicate trigger_softirqs()/wakeup_softirqd().  
Somewhere we somehow corrupt the stack and e.g. in oops7.jpg we return 
to 00c011ed. Note that it's a right-shifted address that could be one of 
these:
 c011ed50 t wakeup_softirqd
 c011ed80 t trigger_softirqs
but it looks pretty weird. DEBUG_STACK_POISON (and the full-debug 
.config i sent) could perhaps uncover other types of stack corruptions.
