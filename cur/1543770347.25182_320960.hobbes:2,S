Would it make sense, Simon, to recommend to Andrew that
he take the simple patch I submitted yesterday for this
now, since it avoids a kernel crash and the risk of other
uglies?
Then, when we understand that improved scalability is needed,
and we have agreed on a solution to that, offer up a second
patch?
I don't mind doing fancier solutions if we need them, but
unless you sense we can obtain rapid agreement on something,
I don't think it's a good idea to avoid the simple fix, while
we are evaluating more complex solutions.
I for one do not have a sense of rapid agreement ;).
