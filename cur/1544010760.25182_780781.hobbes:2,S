When you have more software counters than hardware counters, the
kernel will be time-slicing the counters, but because your program
doesn't run for very long, it's possible that only the first set will
ever get to count anything.
That doesn't seem to explain all the 0 values (since the kernel should
be able to use at least 2 hardware counters on your machine, I expect)
but it might be part of the explanation.
