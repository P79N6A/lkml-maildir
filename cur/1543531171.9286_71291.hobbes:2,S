Oops, I didn't have /dev/hdb4 mounted at the time ("nocheck" was removed
from the latest kernels and I had to do some fstab tweaking), and now
when I try to reproduce it with the 4K filesystem mounted, I can't
reproduce it.  Previously, I reproduced it from (accidentally) /dev/hda2
(2K) copying to /dev/hdc2 (1K).  I also can't reproduce it from /dev/hda4
(another 4K filesystem on the same drive as where I reproduced it before
on (hda2)).  So, maybe there is also a relation to 4K filesystems.
So, it seems to depend on SMP being true, copying over different IDE
buses (maybe), and copying from a non-4K EXT2 filesystem (maybe). 
*boggle* :)
