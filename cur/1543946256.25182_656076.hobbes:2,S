I think it was just a simple context switch benchmark, but not lmbench
(which I found to be a bit too variable). But it was a long time ago...

Yeah, which is why it is a bit different than other CPUs. Although
the L2 cache I guess is still going to suffer from sparse code, but
I guess that is a bit less important.

I was using a Nocona Xeon, which I think is a Prescott class? And
don't they have much higher mispredict penalty (than older P4s)?

And -O2 and -O3, on the gccs that I'm using, AFAIKS.

If the branch is completely predictable (eg. annotated), then I
think branches should be used anyway. Even on well predicted
branches, cmov is similar speed on microbenchmarks, but it will
increase data hazards I think, so it will probably be worse for
some real world situations.

But a likely branch will be _strongly_ predicted to be taken,
wheras a lot of the gcc heuristics simply have slightly more or
slightly less probability. So it's not just a question of which
way is more likely, but also _how_ likely it is to go that way.
