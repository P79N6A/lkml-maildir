Of course, you are correct :(

Well, I could say 'iPAQ' here but I guess it's getting out of
topic.

Well, I have one of those, and it could be a good replacement because
it needs serial only on the development box, not on the target. It
would be acceptable for me in any case (because I already have the
adapter), but it probably won't be in the general case, given the
price ratio between a network card and the USB-Serial adapter.
