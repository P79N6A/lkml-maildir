I am getting logs like this with a Planet PCMCIA Ethernetcard ENW-3502
(10Mbps) on a Highscreen laptop. I already reported this behavior some
time ago on this list. Currently I use kernel 2.2.13pre9 (gcc version
2.7.2.3.f.1). The number of logs increases by high usage of the card
that is by doing things like ping -f. I can also exclude IRQ-problems.

My ethenet adaptor stays alive, however there is some tremendous slowdown
in data transfer.

I agree ;-)
