I'm just summarizing the comment that goes with the definition of the 
time_after etc functions:
include/linux/jiffies.h:88
/*
 *	These inlines deal with timer wrapping correctly. You are 
 *	strongly encouraged to use them
 *	1. Because people otherwise forget
 *	2. Because if the timer wrap changes in future you won't have to
 *	   alter your driver code.
