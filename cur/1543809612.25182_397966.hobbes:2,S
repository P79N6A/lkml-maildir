that's memory corruption - which robust futexes do not (and cannot) 
solve. Robustness is mostly about handling sudden death (e.g. which is 
due to oom, or is due to a user killing the task, or due to the 
application crashing in some non-memory-corrupting way), but it cannot 
handle all possible failure modes.
