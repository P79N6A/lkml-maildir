This is a very good point, which I didn't quite appreciate at first.
I suppose it would be a bad idea to define a new set of unshare flags,
and have unshare use UNSH_NS | UNSH_FS ?  Then clone() could do the
proper translation from CLONE_* to UNSH_*, and call unshare after the
clone().  It still requires more work as clone() is maintained, but
at least it won't be as confusing as you've shown the current case to
be.
