OK.  And this is still
git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/linux-2.6-hrt.git#mm,
yes?
Can we please define the scope of that tree?
Please review
fix-shadowed-variables-in-kernel-posix-cpu-timersc.patch
timers-simplify-lockdep-stuff.patch
hrtimers-simplify-lockdep-stuff.patch
kill-double_spin_lock.patch
ntp-make-the-kernel-ntp-code-hand-64-bit-unsigned-values-to-do_div.patch
from 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/.
  I think they're
all probably git-hrt material.
Can we get that tree into linux-next too please?
