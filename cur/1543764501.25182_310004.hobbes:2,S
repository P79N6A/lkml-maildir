Take your own advice.  From the man page:
       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_ON
              (RB_ENABLE_CAD, 0x89abcdef).  CAD is enabled.  This means
              that the CAD keystroke will immediately cause the action
              associated with LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART.
       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_OFF
              (RB_DISABLE_CAD, 0).  CAD is disabled. This means that the CAD
              keystroke will cause a SIGINT signal to be sent to init
              (process 1), whereupon this process may decide upon a
              proper action (maybe: kill all processes, sync, reboot).
