setjmp/longjmp are normally very hard to follow and maintain,
especially when the kernel has locks, sleeping rules and
multiple threads flying around.
You will see lots of code which does either
int foo_func()
{
	alloc this
	alloc that
	_foo_func()
	free this
	free that
}
or has a single exit path and uses goto out type constructs 
instead
