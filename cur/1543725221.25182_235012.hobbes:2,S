PS: dmesg said
powernow-k8: Found 1 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.00.09b)
powernow-k8: BIOS error - no PSB
I found this in powernow-k8.c.
:
if (powernow_k8_cpu_init_acpi(data)) {
	/*
	 * Use the PSB BIOS structure. This is only availabe on
	 * an UP version, and is deprecated by AMD.
	 */
	if (pol->cpu != 0) {
:
:
i.e. PSB is deprecated. Only if some lookup via ACPI fails, then
the kernel tries PSB. If this fails, too, then it prints an error
message.
The problem is, why does the kernel print an error message
just about the deprecated PSB, if some ACPI stuff doesn't work
as expected?
Would it be possible to add a warning message to
powernow_k8_cpu_init_acpi(), saying something like
	powernow-k8: initialization via ACPI failed,
		trying deprecated PSB structure
