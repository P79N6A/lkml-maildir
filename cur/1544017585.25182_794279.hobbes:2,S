No, I am trying to say that the current code is wrong ;)

Confused. The current code can't be right.
Lets consider the simplest case, there is no "pgrp=" option during mount.
In that case the current code does:
	pid_t pgrp = task_pgrp_nr(current);
	sbi->oz_pgrp = find_get_pid(pgid);
But this means that sbi->oz_pgrp != task_prgp(current), unless of
course we are from the global namespace. ->oz_pgrp is a "random"
pid or NULL.
What I am missed?
Oleg.
