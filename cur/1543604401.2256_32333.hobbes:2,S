Information from fdisk would help - from both versions (with 2.4.11 you'll
need to boot with init=/bin/sh, obviously).  It may be a bug in partition
code, it may be something fishy with guessing geometry (SCSI uses bread()
for that) and it may be something fishy in block devices in pagecache stuff.
If you have sfdisk, sfdisk /dev/sda -O /tmp/foo + mailing the result would
make debugging the thing much simpler (that one - from the 2.4.10).
