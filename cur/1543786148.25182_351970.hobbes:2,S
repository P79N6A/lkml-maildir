Not portable across architectures, and doesn't work across all smp/numa 
environments.  Also not easy to compare with other nodes on the network, 
whereas with ntp-synch'd nodes you can use gettimeofday() for quite 
accurate correlations.

Actually I'm not complaining about additional add instructions.  I was 
just suggesting some reasons why apps might reasonably want to know the 
time frequently.
