Thanks for the explanation. But I run the same kernel (2.3.9 now) with a
Cyrix 6x86MX/PR200 and I haven't experienced any file corruption.
I got once a very ugly oops when I tried to compile the latest egcs
snapshot (19990629) which I was unable to report since the machine
locked
up hard saying "Aiee, killing interrupt" or something like that.
The heavy IO load may have triggered that.

Zoltan
