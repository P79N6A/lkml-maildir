It's possible they can share, but the bootloaders (PPC & MIPS) need a
slight change to the zlib.c code to to allow using zero as a real
address to store the uncompressed data.  So we'd want to guard the
changes with __BOOTER__ or so, and then cp the file or do
#define __BOOTER__
#include "zlib.c"
And do -I$(TOPDIR)/lib, or something along those lines.
