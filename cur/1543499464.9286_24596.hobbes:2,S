Devfs works with permissions.

Devfs also works with symlinks.
Device names might not be hardcoded in the kernel, but they are more or
less hardcoded by conventional usage by end user applications. May not be
proper but thats simply the way it is.
So I will re-iterate since you didnt get it the first time.
Being able to arbitrarily change device names as "justification" for
keeping the current /dev and rejecting devfs, is not as important or as
useful as you make it out to be because:
1) you can also symlink devfs.
2) devfs still has permissions.
