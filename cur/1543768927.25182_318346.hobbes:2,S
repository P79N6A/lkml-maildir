That information leak can be exploited not only on HT or SMP, but on any
CPU with L2 cache. Without HT it's much harder to get information about L2
cache footprint, but it's still possible. If an attacker can make
unlimited number of connections to ssh or http server and manages to get 1
bit in 100 connections, it's still a problem.
Possible solutions:
1) don't use branches and data-dependent memory accesses depending on
secret data
2) flush cache completely when switching to process with different EUID
(0.2ms on Pentium 4 with 1M cache, even worse on CPUs with more cache).
Disabling HT/SMP is not a solution. A year later someone may come with
something like this:
* prefill L2 cache with known pattern
* sleep on some precious timer
* make connection to security application (ssh, https)
* on wakeup, read what's in L2 cache --- get one bit with small
probability --- but when repeated many times, it's still a problem
