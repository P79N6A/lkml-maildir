The places I modified are never invoked during boot (except the below
one). It works like a charm here. I tried again building on top of
2.6.10-rc3 and it works again just fine here (previously I was on top of
the kernel CVS out of sync currently). No idea what's preventing you to
boot, but it's very hard to believe that my patch is to blame for it.
The only modified piece of code that may run during boot is this:
-       might_sleep_if(wait);
+       if (wait)
+               cond_resched();
You can try to put back a might_slee_if(wait), but if it deadlocks with
that change sure it's not a bug in my patch, it's instead a bug
somewhere else that calls alloc_pages w/o GFP_ATOMIC. Ingo's
lowlatency patch would expose the same bug too since they're aliasing
the might_sleep to cond_resched.
But I can't reproduce anything wrong here.
Enabling unmasked SIMD FPU exception support... done.
Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.

machine boots and run just fine and the patch is definitely applied.
PREEMPT=n but it can't be a bug in my patch even if PREEMPT=y breaks.
