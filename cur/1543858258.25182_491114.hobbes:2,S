I have to admit that I've only been paying attention with one eye, but
why doesn't this require a read?  If "foo" is non-zero in size, then
how does the client determine how much data in the buffer to write to
the server?
Isn't RMW required for any i/o which is either not buffer aligned or
a multiple of the buffer size?
    Thanx...
