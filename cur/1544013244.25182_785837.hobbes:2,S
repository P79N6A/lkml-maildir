I think bloat-o-meter is a marvelous tool, and I'm a big fan of python.  But I 
don't think you shouldn't have to run that to compile a kernel either, largely 
because not needing it for the first 17 years or so implied living without 
this requirement could be done, sustainably even.
There's a difference between a development workstation and a dedicated build 
system.  Requiring you to install X11 plus qt on the headless build server 
cranking out nightly snapshots in order to run the configure stage of the 
kernel build would be silly.  But this is not an argument for ripping out 
"make xconfig" from the kernel.
Spot the difference?

I'm saying it's a major new environmental dependency that went in fairly 
recently and largely without comment, and it causes real world headaches for 
real people, of which I am only one.
If you don't think environmental dependencies are a problem, I welcome you to 
attempt to build open office.  (Even the gentoo guys gave up on that one and 
just started shipping a prebuilt binary.)
I think large amounts of complexity start with small amounts of complexity 
that grow.  Complexity is inevitable, but there should be a _reason_ for 
increases in it.

I didn't say the job was finished.  These are just the ones I've already 
personally hit, and thus A) needed to rewrite to build the kernel in my build 
environment, B) have a handy test case for.

A) It's a start.
B) It works for me, and builds the .configs I've personally needed so far.

Coming up with new patches and modifying the source is a different use for 
source code than going "./configure; make; make install".  This is true for 
most open source software, I'd expect.
Or are you implying that eclipse or Emacs are such great IDEs that being able 
to build outside of a GUI isn't interesting?  The ability to build within an 
IDE should be allowed to preclude the ability to build without one?

Never start anything unless you can finish it all in one go, eh?
Last I heard the kernel guys tend to frown on people who wander off in their 
own corner for a year and then dump a massive rewrite on them.  They seem to 
prefer the incremental "trail of breadcrumbs" approach.  Release early, 
release often, incorporate feedback, keep at it.
Or am I wrong?

Complexity is a cost, environmental dependencies are a form of complexity, if 
the benefit isn't worth the cost (or you can get the benefit without the cost) 
then you shouldn't pay the cost.
I was unaware this was a controversial attitude?

And yet despite "unifdef" being an existing tool, the kernel developers didn't 
require you to install it on your host, but instead built their own version 
from source.  (They didn't even require you to install a version of cpio on 
the host that understands -H newc, but instead built their own initramfs 
packer in C.)  More recently, they integrated dtc (the device tree compiler).
In each case, they made a balancing decision, and decided that integrating and 
maintaining a small C tool was better than having an environmental dependency.

Apparently so.
I don't care if checkstack.pl is written in perl for the same reason I don't 
care if eclipse is written in java.  They're not build dependencies.
If I had to install gdb as a precondition of compiling the Linux kernel I'd 
think something was funny with that, which isn't saying I object to the 
existence of gdb or the ability to hook it up to kgdb or qemu or UML to poke 
at kernels.  It's two different categories.
It seems clear to _me_, anyway.  But it is coming up on 7am and I haven't 
gotten to bed yet, so take that for what it's worth...
