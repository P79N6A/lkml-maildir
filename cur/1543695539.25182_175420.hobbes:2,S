Mmm.  Seems you're right.
So I grabbed the latest synaptics stuff (from a couple of days ago) and
updated my XF86Config-4.  There I discovered that I am not crazy just
stupid.
I had an (InputDevice) entry looking at /dev/input/mice, another one
looking at /dev/input/eventX and a third looking at /dev/psaux. Removing
the cruft and updating the synaptics entry has fixed my problem.
Sorry for the noise.
