No, gcc was allocating memory and dying quite normally. The problem
being, other processes were also trying to allocate memory and dying
as a result.
There were no visible console messages, since I don't HAVE a seperate
console - I was in X at the time, which also died when unable to
allocate memory.
Changing from demand-allocated memory (overcommit) to
request-allocated memory could have helped a bit, I suppose, if all my
processes had already allocated all the memory they needed but not
used it yet. (OTOH, I would consider doing that to be a bug in the
app...)
