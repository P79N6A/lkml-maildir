The real problem is with mis-configured userspaces, where buggy UTF-8
decoders are trying to make sense of data in legacy encodings
containing essentially random bytes > 127, which are not part of valid
UTF-8 sequences.
None of this is a real problem, if everything is set up correctly and
bug free.  Unfortunately the Just Works thing falls apart in the,
(frequent), instances that it's not :-(.
