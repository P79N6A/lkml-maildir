Subject: x86 merge: Keep kernel/cpu for CPU specific code?

x86 CPU specific code is currently implemented in different ways for
64 and 32 bit. While there are almost no CPU specific files for 64
bit, there is the arch/x86/kernel/cpu/ directory for 32 bit. Is there
already an idea about whether to use kernel/cpu also for 64 bit?
Thanks,
