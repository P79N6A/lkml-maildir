This would mean 11.5 hits/second and 5.8 CGI hits/second if the load is
equally distibuted along the day. But usually it isn't. So you easily get
double the numbers or even more hits during the business hours.
20 or more hits/second shouldn't be a problem for your machine and your
network should do that too, but 10-20CGI bins per second may be a problem. 
What kind of CGI bins do you have? perl? I've measured the startuptime of 
perl on my (slow) machine when it is already in the diskcache. It says 0.03 sec
(/usr/bin/time /usr/bin/perl < /dev/null). Let's say that your machine can do
it in 0.01 sec. So 20 perl startups already take 20% of the time of one CPU.
Now keep in mind that the perl scripts are interpreted and way slower than 
compiled code. It is possible that even with 2 CPUs your computer is
underpowered. Think about buying xeons instead of normal PIIs. But I would
recommend that you rewrite your CGIs in C and have a look what happens then.

128MB may be not enough.

Do you serve remote files? If so, this may be a problem.

Have you tried the normal nfsd? I think it can handle file locks too.
By the way, knfsd is the nfs server not the client, do you export
things too? For the nfs mount from Irix the nfs client is important.
What mount parameters do you use?

Do the keyboard leds still work then (in textmode not under X)?

If your machine is underpowered, switching to another OS won't help. If it's
a nfs problem (like you suspect in one of the following mails) it might.
Hmmm... let's start debugging.
