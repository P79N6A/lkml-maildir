Really? The only 32-bit Unix's I've seen the details of
are SCO Unix, Interactive Unix, Linux, and BSD Unix.
The other Unix's I've become familiar are Sun-OS, the
original AT&T(Unix System Labs)/SYS-V and DEC Ultrix.
All these Unix's share user address-space with kernel
address-space. This is supposed to be the very thing
that makes Unix different from other VMS/timeshare
Operating Systems.
I think that if this shared address-space doesn't exist
then you don't have "Unix". You have something (perhaps
better), but it's not Unix. For instance VAX/VMS doesn't
share address space. In fact, the VAX/VMS kernel is, itself,
a process. This means it has its own context. This can
be quite useful.
Would you please tell me what Unix has 32-bit address space
which is not shared with the kernel?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
