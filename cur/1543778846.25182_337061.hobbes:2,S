Hello Andrew,
I have some questions :-)
Reiser4:
why there are undefined functions implemented that currently not in use?
This messages appeared first time in 2.6.13-rc3-mm2.
Any why it complains even CONFIG_REISER4_DEBUG is not set?
Please have a look at  the -->snip
SCSI:
CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX=y ? I haven't choose that one..I never did..and 
where is the config located?
In the place where it is..is no option marked.
Thanks for help,
Greets
    Michael
