	Far as I know yes, enabling Advanced routing gives the
Multipath option.  Multipath should be on.
	Advanced routing also enables rp_filter.  If you get martian
packet warnings, or seem to lose alot of packets take a look at the
rp_filter stuff.  (rp_filter is route path filtering, and sometimes
needs to be disabled for a multipath interface, depending on your
local routing).
