Find an Intel reference manual and have look at the description of the 
int and iret instructions. Both need a lot of microcode to perform their
tasks and access several structures kept in memory:
- int $0x80 from user mode accesses:
  1) an 8 byte entry in the IDT
  2) an 8 byte code segment descriptors (in the GDT)
  3) 8 bytes in the TSS to get the new stack since the privilege
     level changes
  4) an 8 byte stack segment descriptor (in the GDT)
  every one of these accesses is followed by complex validity checks
  (segment present, correct privilege level or type...) even if you only
  take the 32 bit protected mode case into account. It finally pushes 20
  bytes on the stack (ss/esp/eflags/cs/eip). Do not forget that the
  processor has to do all of this or nothing (internal state can't change
  until the processor has determined that all memory accesses can be
  performed, for example that they don't cause a page fault).
- iret to user mode also performs complex checks and at least has to
  access 2 segment descriptors for user mode code and stack segments.
  But it is significantly simpler than int $0x80.
