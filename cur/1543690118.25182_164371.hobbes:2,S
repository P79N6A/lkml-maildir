Nope, user error :-).

Nope, your CMD649 was handled by generic PCI IDE driver.

Assumption that current .config will work with future kernel versions is *false*.
Just add these two lines to your .config:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD64X=y

Your VIA IDE controller was handled by generic IDE chipset driver which
did probe devices *after* PCI controllers are probed, so CMD649 took
ide0 and ide1 first.
