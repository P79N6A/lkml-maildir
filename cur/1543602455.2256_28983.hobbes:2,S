Hi!
I need to allocate as much memory as possible (but not more). Okay, so
I use out_of_memory, right?
Does this code look sane?
static void eat_memory(void)
{
        int i = 0;
        void **c= eaten_memory, *m;
        printk("Eating pages ");
        while ((m = (void *) get_free_page(GFP_USER))) {
                memset(m, 0, PAGE_SIZE);
                eaten_memory = m;
                if (!(i%5000))
                        printk( "." );
                *eaten_memory = c;
                c = eaten_memory;
                i++;
                if (out_of_memory())
                        break;
        }
        printk("(%dK)\n", i*4);
}
[if not, how should I code it?]
But, when I looked into out_of_memory... Of course its
wrong. out_of_memory() contains
        if (nr_swap_pages > 0)
                return 0;
...which is obviously wrong. It is well possible to have free swap
_and_ be out of memory -- eat_memory() loop gets system to this state
easily.
