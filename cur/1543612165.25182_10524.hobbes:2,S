Not a solution but more of a problem... a user might see:
eth0: startup message
eth0: startup message
{failure, unregisters eth0}
eth0: startup message
eth0: startup message
{failure, unregisters eth0}
eth0: startup message
eth0: startup message
{failure, unregisters eth0}
That's particularly messy to diagnose when eth0 may not really be eth0. 
Further in a hotplug multi-threaded world you are reserving an ethernet
interface which may not be used.
I greatly prefer assigning board numbers (ns83820_0, ns83820_0, or ns0,
ns1, ns2) temporarily until you are sure you can register the interface
with the likelihood it will not be unregistered until module removal
time, or never [if built into kernel].
