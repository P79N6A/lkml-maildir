In retrospect I have to agree. It's clearly better to only show the long
filenames and have special "VFAT aware" programs to handle backups. This
can be done via ioctl, a /proc interface, etc. It's a robust solution.

Yes, I agree. The existing Linux VFAT filesystem is clean, UNIX-like, it
hides the major braindamages, and it fails in very few cases. Far better
to solve specific problems (like VFAT backups) with specialised tools.
