Subject: 2.6.10 kernel panic: IDE/SCSI related?

I'm getting regular kernel panics with a vanilla 2.6.10 kernel.
Not sure how to tell which bit is causing the panic from the output
(which isn't logged).
Some of the output noted down by pen+paper:
Process Swapper (pid:0 threading info=c04b8000 task=c042db00)
Stack: ....
Call trace:
[] runtimer.softirq+0x11f/0x170
unknown boot option +0x0/0x...
code: f3....
kernel panic - not syncing: fatal exception in interupt
It crashes about every 2 days, usually when writing to disk but I'm
guessing here.
I have a system with 3 SCSI cards:
Adaptec AHA-2940/2940W
Adaptec AIC-7892A U160/m
American Megatrends Inc. MegaRAID 428 Ultra RAID Controller
An the IDE bus is:
[SiS] 5513
and maybe it could be related to this mix of hardware?
How do I begin to try and diagnose this problem? Really want to help
to fix this if I can.
