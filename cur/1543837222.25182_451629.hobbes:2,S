The actual review needed is in the existing clock source drivers
I guess.
I definitely don't want the "read three times" pmtimer code that 
is in the generic clock source on 64bit. You would need at least an ifdef
there or better detect the case where it is needed at runtime.

The previous comment was more correct. It is really TSC clocks.

And that comment can't have the same unit as the earlier one?

Another one? Don't we have already too many of these variables?

It would need to be _sync

Are you sure this handles p-state invariant TSC correctly?
And I hope there is a printk somewhere when this happens?

How can tsc_khz be 0 ?

So what clocksource does it use before?
BTW I guess i would be ok with putting tsc and hpet into their own files.
And is there a reason HPET can't be generic in drivers/clocksource now?

No 64bit HPET support?

How is priority of the different time sources established in this? 
e.g. is the old fallback selection logic still fully functional?
