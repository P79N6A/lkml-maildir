OK now I'm awake ;)
Actually, this part wasn't tested at all.  I just blindly applied the
patch for 2.6.16.  Simply discard it.

Yes, that looks better anyway.

I believe your patch fixes the problem we had -- the compilation of
external modules with extra headers (created via "make prepare")
outside the kernel source root.  At least, I can build external
alsa-driver modules now.
Of course, each package must be fixed to adapt somes changes in 2.6.18
(implicit inclusion of linux/config.h and linux/utsrelease.h)...
Thanks,
