If you're using run-time ACPI features, you'll probably want to
make sure that your MB BIOS is the latest available.
I didn't see which VIA 693 MB you've got, but it could be that a
BIOS upgrade would move it from 09/13/00 to something past 1/1/2001 --
the (yes, arbitrary) cutoff for enabling ACPI by default.
Or you could add "acpi=force" to your command line, as suggested in the
dmesg output.
Or you could change the source to alter or disable #define
ACPI_BLACKLIST_CUTOFF_YEAR 2001
If your system misbehaves when ACPI is enabled by one of these methods,
please let me know.
Thanks,
-Len
