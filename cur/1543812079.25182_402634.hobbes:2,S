I wonder if we really need that map_valid pointer there.  The normal way of
communicating the validity of a bh is via buffer_uptodate().  I _think_
that's an appropriate thing to use here.  With appropriate comments, of
course..
If those options are not a sufficiently good fit then we can easily create
a new buffer-head.state bit for this purpose - there are lots to spare.
