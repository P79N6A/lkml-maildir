 XTP looks like a very interesting protocol. 
I did some work with XTP a few years back.  It's interesting but it's a very 
heavyweight protocol compared to TCP.  It tries to be all things to all men 
and it's debatable whether it really succeeds.
It would certainly be worth having in the kernel, however.
