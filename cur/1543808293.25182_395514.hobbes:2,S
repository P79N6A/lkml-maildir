You have apparently missed that I offered to relicense the patch under
MIT license (which is liberal, allows modifications and everything)
after I'd confirmed the integration went OK; and I was just returning
the buck of being forced to change interface identifications all over
the map from "mustn't modify" sections.
The first step would be to look at the patch nonetheless, because it
conveys information that Jörg has not extracted from messages since the
first time SG_IO in ide-cd cropped up.
