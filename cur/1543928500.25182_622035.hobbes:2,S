Subject: [PATCH] Fix assertion failure in fs/jbd/checkpoint.c

  Hi,
  the patch below should fix an assertion failure in JBD checkpointing
code. The patch survived some fsstress and similar runs on my test machine
so it shouldn't be obviously wrong ;).

Before we start committing a transaction, we call
__journal_clean_checkpoint_list() to cleanup transaction's written-back
buffers. If this call happens to remove all of them (and there were already
some buffers), __journal_remove_checkpoint() will decide to free the
transaction because it isn't (yet) a committing transaction and soon we fail
some assertion - the transaction really isn't ready to be freed :).
We change the check in __journal_remove_checkpoint() to free only a transaction
in T_FINISHED state. The locking there is subtle though (as everywhere in
JBD ;(). We use j_list_lock to protect the check and a subsequent call to
__journal_drop_transaction() and do the same in the end of
journal_commit_transaction() which is the only place where a transaction can
get to T_FINISHED state. Probably I'm too paranoid here and such locking is
not really necessary - checkpoint lists are processed only from
log_do_checkpoint() where a transaction must be already committed to be
processed or from __journal_clean_checkpoint_list() where kjournald itself
calls it and thus transaction cannot change state either. Better be safe if
something changes in future...
