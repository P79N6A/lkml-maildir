The problem is that there's currently nothing to allow a binary search through
the unwind descriptors. The easy path to add these is closed as binutils don't
work here due to two independent limitations. Hence I'm going to add a two-
phase initializations, the second part of which will allocate and initialize a
helper table equivalent to a linker generated .eh_frame_hdr section. I'm not
certain at this point whether we'll need this for modules too.
