I make a change in my patch before I post, to default it to on, rather than to
off.  Although I did that for convienience, not necessity.  I didn't realize
those files didn't show up until the interface was marked as up.  That seems
horribly broken to me.  We should definately have some registered file at
creation time, perhaps create the files when register_netdev is called and put
them in /proc/sys/ipv4/conf/offline/<interface>/*, and move them
conf/<interface> when IFF_UP is set?
