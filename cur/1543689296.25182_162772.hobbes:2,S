This is only truly feasible when the nodes are homogeneous. They will
not be as there will be physical locality (esp. bits like device
proximity) concerns. It's vaguely possible some kind of punting out
of the kernel of the solutions to these concerns is possible, but upon
the assumption it will appear, we descend further toward science fiction.
Some of these proposals also beg the question of "who's going to write
the rest of the hypervisor supporting this stuff?", which is ominous.
