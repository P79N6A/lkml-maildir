I'm not going to force anybody to do anything. There is a nubmer of
reasons to use  unicode, but if somebody finds them not convincing, he
is free to use any other encoding. If somebody uses koi8-r as his
primary encoding and wants to mount a cp1251 or unicode-encoded file
system, he is free to do it, although he should be ready to loose some
characters.
