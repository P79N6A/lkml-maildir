Don't trust it! Spoofing the MAC address is quite easy for a knowledged

It's just possible. You can just call cpuid from userspace. I never known
if it's possible to disable it from userspace. The problem is that to
understand what the browser is doing you have to read the asm. If instead
the information cames from /proc you only need an `strace | grep
/proc/cpuinfo'.
