Ah, ok. I'm not 100% sure, but I think some chips, like cx88 could theoretically
support a baseband tuner. But you're right: there's no known board using mt2266.

Good point. 
It seems easier to maintain if we should move all terrestrial/cable [1]
(analog and/or digital) tuners into common/tuners. 
Cheers,

[1] I don't see any technical sense of moving satellite tuners, except for
having just one place for all tuners, or if there are some tendency of hybrid
satellite/terrestrial tuners.
