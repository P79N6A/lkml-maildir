It doesn't matter what you think.  It doesn't matter what I think.  The point
is there are ABI's out there which have a completely different calling sequence
depending on what the arguments are, and GCC has to fit in with that ABI, no
ifs and, or buts.  For example, consider the original MIPS calling sequence
(note, it has been a few years since I wrote for that particular ABI, so I may
be wrong on a few details):
   1)	If the function takes variable arguments, the first 4 arguments are
	passed in registers, every thing else is passed on the stack.
   2)	If the first 1 or 2 arguments are floating point they are passed in
	appropriate fp registers.  If any floating point argument occurs after
	a non floating point argument is found, it is passed in the general
	purpose registers.
   3)	Up to 4 words are passed in gprs (and anything passed in the fprs
	counts against the 4 words), the remainder are passed on the stack.
Note, the reason for such complicated calling is to try and optimize the common
case.  If you pass everything on the stack, that means at least 2 memory
references per argument that might not be needed.  If you pass fp values in gpr
registers, you need either a costly move between the fprs and the gprs (in the
case of the MIPS -- yes, it is only two instructions, but the latency is
something like 3 cycles in the original MIPS), or you have to store and load
(in the case of the PowerPC).  In my 23+ years of hacking languages, I haven't
met an ABI that didn't have warts, even in the ABIs I designed myself.

ABIs these days tend to be designed by people trying to optimize the C
language.  Its a slight step up from designing ABIs for Fortran IV, which was
common when I was in college.

And such calling sequences are much slower, so you are penalizing maybe 90% or
99% of the code to get relief in one area.  Deal with it (I'm not unsympathetic
to your pleas, I just don't think the world is going to slow down to accomidate
special cases).
