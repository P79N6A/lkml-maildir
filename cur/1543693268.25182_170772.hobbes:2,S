Hi,
an update from the time I posted the previous message:
1) Broadcom has since released a 7.0.0 version of their driver, it works 
just fine with the latest 2.6 kernels (tried it on 2.6.0-test6 and using 
it right now on 2.6.0-test6-mm4).
2) The in-kernel tg3 driver still doesn't work with the Broadcom 5901 
NIC (tried with 2.6.0-test6 and 2.6.0-test6-mm4). Same symptoms as 
previously (card is found and appears as eth0, but no traffic is 
sent/recieved by the card).
3) I've asked around on a few lists (debian-user, debian-laptop-user and 
linux-thinkpad) but been unable to find any G40 owner that has tried the 
tg3 driver with their NIC. It seems that all of them are using the 
bcm5700 driver which would explain the lack of other bug reports. Are 
there any G40 owners on this list who would be willing to test if the 
tg3 driver in the latest kernels work with their NIC's?
Kind regards,
David
