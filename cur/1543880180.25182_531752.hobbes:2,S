Ok, I'll give that a whirl under 2.6.21-rc7 tonight.  I'll build them
in modular so I can switch around more easily.  I hope.  :]

It seemed like a good buy at the time when I was researching these

but obviously I got a bum deal somewhere down the line.
Now I've got a Sil3114 SATA controller, which seems to be working just
fine now.  Hopefully it won't have problems like this!
