It's wrong, because next_thread() relies on
    task->pids[PIDTYPE_TGID].pid_chain.next
That pointer is not valid after detach_pid(task, PIDTYPE_TGID), and 
that's called within __unhash_process.  Thus next_thread() fails if it's 
called on a dead task. Srivatsa's second patch is the right change: If 
pid_alive() is wrong, then break from the loop without calling 
next_thread().
