Hello Ryan,
>From what I can see. With chrooting, I have to make a complete "fake" system an
then place the users below that into a home directory, or make a complete "fake"
system for each user.
I was trying to find a simple solution that would allow for:
I was initially thinking about something like this for each user:
/system (real) /dev/hda4 (chrooted also)
      |
      /bin
      /etc
      /lib
/home (each user chrooted)
     |
     /user1
     |     |
     |     /system (mounted /dev/hda4)
     |            |
     |            /bin
     |            /etc
     |            /lib
     |
     /user2
     |     |
     |     /system (mounted /dev/hda4)
     |            |
     |            /bin
     |            /etc
     |            /lib
     |
     /user n
          |
          /system (mounted /dev/hda4)
                 |
                 /bin
                 /etc
                 /lib
The basic problem is that I did not want, for example "user2" to be able to "cd
.." or some thing to go out of user2
I was hoping to be able to accomplish this at the filesystem level somehow, and
possibly without the need to mount the /dev/hda4 onto each /home/user/system, or
without having to make entire copies of the chrooted environment for each user.
Cheers,
Lonnie
