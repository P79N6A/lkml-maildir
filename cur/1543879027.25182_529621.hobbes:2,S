The whole part_uevent_suppress stuff is not really nice, causing the
code to use a lot of kobject_{init,add} and kobject_{del,put} instead
of kobject_register and kobject_unregister. Looking at
driver-class/block-device.patch in Greg's tree, it should be possible
to use something like the uevent_filter stuff after block has been
converted.
