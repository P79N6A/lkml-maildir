A know problem with some combinations of binutils and kernel sources. As
Debian bintuils package says:
x You may experience problems linking older (and some newer) kernels with  x 
x this version of binutils.  This is not because of a bug in the linker,   x 
x but rather a bug in the kernel source.  This is being worked out and     x 
x fixed by the upstream kernel group in newer kernels, but not all of the  x 
x problems may have been fixed at this time.  Older kernel versions will   x 
x almost always exhibit the problem, however, and no attempts are being    x 
x made to fix those that we know of.                                       x 
x                                                                          x 
x There are a few work-arounds, but the most reliable is to edit the       x 
x linker script for your architecture (e.g. arch/i386/vmlinux.lds) and     x 
x remove the '*(.text.exit)' entry from the 'DISCARD' line.  It will       x 
x bloat the kernel somewhat, but it should link properly.                  x
