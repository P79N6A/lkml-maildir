Ah. Beautiful. I just had the flash of inspiration to do it right after
unwrapping a copy of "Linux Core Kernel Commentary" from under the tree,
and didn't bother to check it in real life before posting. The book was
based on 2.2, and I could have sworn nobody had touched Java in 2.3 :)

This book is absolutely marvelous for anyone trying to truly understand
the innards of the kernel proper. Within a few pages of reading I nailed
concepts that I had once felt very shaky with. Get it! Get it now! Return
all your other holiday gifts and use the money to buy as many copies of it
as you can!
