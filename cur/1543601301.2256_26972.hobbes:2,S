Look at it that way: we have two actions that need to be done upon umount.
	1) detach it from the mountpoint(s)
	2) shut it down
For the latter we need to have no active IO on that fs _and_ nothing
that could initiate such IO.  We can separate #1 and #2, letting fs
shutdown happen when it's no longer busy.  That's what MNT_DETACH
does.
What you are asking for is different - you want fs-wide revoke().
That's all nice and dandy, but it's an independent problem and it
will take a _lot_ of work.  Including work in fs drivers.  It _is_
worth doing, but it's 2.5 stuff (along with normal revoke(2)).
IMNSHO we really should separate the stuff acting on mount tree from
the stuff acting on filesystems.  A lot of confusion comes from the
places where we don't do that - see the "per-mountpoint read-only"
thread couple of weeks ago for other examples.
