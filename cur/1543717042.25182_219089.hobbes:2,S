I don't think that patch will work, and here is why (at least in my case). 
There they are using 4k alignment, but unfortunately I already tried that 
and it required that the memory be aligned on its allocation size.
Could you try my patch instead of the one described in the bug report and 
see if it works?
Thanks!
