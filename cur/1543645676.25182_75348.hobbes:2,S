It wouldn't.  sys_create_module doesn't get the absolute path of the module passed.

For gods sake, what interface do you want to /bin/mv?  network device don't have
associated special files in Linux (or BSD).  I'm talking about SIOCSIFNAME.

If I wanted to implement a trusted system: yes.  I you wanted and paid me
enough for it: also yes.  And that's exactly my point.  If you want a
trusted system you're not done by adding a few hooks in places that look
strategic, you have to a proper audit of _all_ code in your project.
Let me repeat _ALL_ code.  Yes, you have to understand WTF is going on,
and that's where LSM fail miserably.

Noooh!  You got something very wrong.  You (or rather the LSM people) want to
add a new feature, and they have to prove it useful.  An as long as there is no
standard on what a specific string in a module option means for the kernel
in the end such a check is pretty damn useless.

How does the lsm author know what the option x=y means for my module?  In my
module a it means print lots of nice windowish nagscreen, but in my friend
Paul's module (who works for the German BND) it means scribble all over my
disk because only someone who has stolen the notebook might be stupid
enough to use such a silly option.
See what I mean?

From my reading of the LSM lists a hgook usually got added because author A
of the unaudited module B though that it might help him in imlpementing what
he and only he thinks his module should do if it worked properly.
