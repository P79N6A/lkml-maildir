Umm...  Wait a second.  You've seen the problems on ->i_sem variant
of llseek()?  My apologies - I've misparsed you.
I seriously suspect that BKL-for-lseek() will be good enough once we
kill BKL in ext2_get_block() and friends.  IOW, I doubt that
generic_file_lseek() showing up in BKL contention is the real
problem...
