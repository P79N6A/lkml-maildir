just in case it wasnt obvious ... your feedback is really useful, no
matter in what direction it goes. You have one of the most complex test
setups, so i pretty much expect your setup to trigger the most problems
as well (and it is also the hardest to analyze). I think we are fine as
long as constant progress is made (which i believe we are making, even
if seemingly not for your particular workload =B-).
