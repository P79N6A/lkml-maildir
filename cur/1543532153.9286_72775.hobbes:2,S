No its not.  devfs is fundamentally different from all drivers,
including the filesystem drivers...  It is quite different from other
pieces of code and cannot be considered in the same context as another
driver.

not an option.  cannot force all users of 'hackkernel' package to change
their tried-and-true LILO settings.  Vendor kernels are different from
user-built kernels.  There are considerations of scale which don't come
into play when you're talking about a single person building their own
custom kernel.
