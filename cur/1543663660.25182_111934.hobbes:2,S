hello,
i'm running linux rh7 with 2.2 kernel as router/firewall with masqd dns 
service running on dns server inside the local network.
i intercepted some "(DF)" messages after accepted request from internet, 
using tcpdump on dns server, to dns server inside local lan could result 
in timed out (for some) requests ?
regards, himba
ps. i'm sorry if you read this post somewhere else, but i need help urgent!
