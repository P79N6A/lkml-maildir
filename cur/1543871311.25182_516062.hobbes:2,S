I'd add that Xorg has its own scheduler (for X11 operations, of course),
that has its own quirks, and chances are that it is the one you're
testing with glxgears. And as Con said, as long as glxgears does more
FPS than your screen refresh rate, its flickering its completely
meaningless: it doesn't even attempt to sync with vblank. Al, you'd
better try with Quake3 or Nexuiz, or even Blender if you want to test 3D
interactivity under load.
