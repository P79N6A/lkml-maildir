dummy printks are not a good idea at all. Often the weak versions are the 
ones that get used and it would be very annoying if there was a per boot 
(or even per syscall!) 'dummy printk'.

that pretty much removes the advantages of __weak symbols: to provide 
default implementations for various functionality, without having to do
#ifdefs. The default implementation will often want to be near the usage
site - so these bugs will reoccur again and again.
