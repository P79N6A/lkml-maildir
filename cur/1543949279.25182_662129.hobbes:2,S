It's an issue, but it's not as big as you seem to think.
The error drift should be small and 150ppm isn't too good, but it isn't an 
error to be too worried about.
As the alpha example shows, in the past we already tried to reduce this 
error anyway, in this case by choosing an appropriate HZ value.

Practically it should be enough to just check the base drift and print a 
warning message, as it suggest to be more likely a configuration error.
