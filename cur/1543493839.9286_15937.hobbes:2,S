I am aware of this chipset and vendor and problems with Linux.
Please apply "uniform-ide-6.19.patch" from the URL below and it will at
least acknowledge the chipset.
Send me the report/contents of ::
cat /proc/ide/ide0/config > hint_ide.pci

Subject: HiNT CS8011/CS8012 Pentium PCI Chip Set
I am requesting Documentation and Specs on this chipset as it relates to
configuring the EIDE controller and any other related associated bridge
pre-inits/configures.  If possible, C-source that would be used to create
a chipset specific driver if needed.
