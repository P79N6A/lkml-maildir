I'm uneasy with the unbounded recursion. Sure currently all the users
are controlled in kernel source code and expect to put in sane patterns.
But if someone ever adds a user controlled glob in some way it will be 
trivial to crash/overwrite memory with the limited kernel stack.
And with such a generalized function it's likely to be used more
in the future.
