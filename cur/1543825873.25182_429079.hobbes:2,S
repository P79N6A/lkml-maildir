Looks like you didn't bother to read that complaint and the follow-up
messages.  Robert Marquardt's device has two configurations, one using 100
mA and the other using 500 mA.  Before my patch, Linux would always
install the high-power config -- even if the device was behind a
bus-powered hub.  According to Robert:
	This can trigger the overcurrent protection of a bus powered 
	hub which usually then switches off completely dragging down
	three other innocent devices.
	Please tell me that Linux kernel programmers are not that idiotic.
I'll avoid speculations about which kernel programmers are or are not 
idiotic...
