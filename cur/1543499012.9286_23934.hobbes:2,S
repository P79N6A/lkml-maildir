I'm confused.  The comments and code in process.c tell me that "Lazy FP
saving no longer makes any sense..."
It seems to me that whenever a task switch is about to take place
the FP exceptions should be syncronized.  This greatly simplifies
code paths; the task generating the exception will always be active
when the exception arrives.
You also seem to have missed my point that exceptional cases should
be rare.  If there are several fpu/mmx/sse using tasks, but exceptions
never show up then all of the fpxxenv cycles are wasted.  Just to
restate, there are two cases for needing the tagword (the only field
requiring conversion I know of):
1) an exception does come up - the exceptional context is currently
   loaded in the FPU; hello fsave.
2) task monitoring - which I would also believe is atypical.  As I said
   I don't have any data for this. but I would think it is only needed
   when debugging FP tasks.  Yes, the context is probably different, 
   but this is a situation where we can take a performance hit.

I'm confused here about cpu reset.  How can fwait and fxsave cause the
whole cpu to reset?  I'd really like to see the context of this.  There
is a situation I ran into at boot that required special handling be 
added to the general case.  That is the generation of an fpu exception
at kernel boot so the exception response method may be checked.  There
is no handler and the TS bit and well as the used_math flag have been 
cleared so the exception loops if exceptions aren't masked...  Well it
is a little more complicated than that, but I just trying to guess
at what you were saying.

That is great if there is no need to rely on resetting or masking
FP exceptions after a save.  I could only get as far as the special
boot problem mentioned above w/o resetting.  A work around for that
would be great.  Maybe a temporary signal handler.  For clarification
the requirement we have met to get away with no masking exceptions are:
1) after an exceptional state is saved
   a) the TS bit is immediately set
   b) no ESC instruction will excute until the exception is 
      cleared or masked
2) (implying) no ESC opcode within the kernel
3) every exception has some kind of fixup handler

Lets look at the two cases:
EXCEPTION
  My method - 200 for FSAVE
  Your method - (80 for copy + 50 fnstenv) + (50 fnstenv @ task switch)
  => if there are 2+ task switches involving fpu usage you lose
PTRACE
  My method - 200 for FSAVE + 100+ for FXRSTOR
  Your method - same
  => lets say 5+ task switches are needed
     If there are no switches then the monitor will be delay 200 cycles.

But there is no need to have duplicate state saved.  Just create it when
you need it => 32 bytes.  I don't really know how many thread the typical
system runs with, but it is some thing.
I agree that FSTENV or FSAVE is needed to get it directly out of the CPU.
There is a manual conversion, but we agree it is more trouble than it
is worth.

The trap number will be 19 instead of 16.

There are no determinism problems I can see.
For all existing apps under method 2a:
  FPU exception => existing FPU struct passed
For all non-existing apps under method 2a:
  FPU exception => existing FPU struct passed
  SSE exception => FXSAVE/FXRSTOR (FXSR) struct passed
 with 3 option:
  FPU exception with apps requesting FXSR state => FXSR struct passed

Anyone else out there with thought or insight?
Please correct me if I am wrong about anything.  I've
just start using/modifying Linux in the last few weeks.
