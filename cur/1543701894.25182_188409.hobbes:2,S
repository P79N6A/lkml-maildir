Are you sure that VMware is a culprit? I had to apply patch below to get
floppy option to work at all (otherwise buggy kernel options parser which
does not understand quotes comes in a way making it impossible to do
f.e. "floppy=1,6,cmos").
And even then configuration with more than one floppy drive is broken:
all floppies will use same queue, but it is not allowed - there is even
comment in the code saying "to be cleaned up" before add_disk() call,
and from my understanding there must be 1:1 relation between queues
and registered disks. Otherwise (at least) sysfs breaks and will
crash on floppy unload as queue is deleted twice from sysfs, and it does not 
like doing such things...
