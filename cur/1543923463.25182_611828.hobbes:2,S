It is for programs that only give out 2 channels of audio data.
Qdsp_dpl2 is a node that applies the DPL2 matrix on these two channels,
yielding the rear 2 channels, giving some sort of surround effect.

I figured that exceeded my skills at that time.

IIRC, yes, been through all sorts of hdparm options. -Z did not help
at all, and -B only prolonged the delay from 5 to around 15 seconds.
I contacted Tosh Corp (before posting on lkml) and while they know of
the 'issue', I did not get a satisfactory answer (namely how to FIX
it), so I thought why spend time slapping if there's a workaround...
Causing a minimal head seek every now and then (4096 bytes per 3
seconds is a somewhat small block size with a not-too-low interval)
is a working workaround for now. The module code is not top notch,
but I doubt I'll ever have more than one 1.8" MK2003GAH disk in the
same laptop.
