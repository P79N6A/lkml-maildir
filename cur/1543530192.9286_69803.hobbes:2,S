We're having some problems talking NFS to a NetApp server (kernel 2.2.5 and 2.2.13).  I'd appreciate it if an NFS guru could help out with some trace interpretation.
I'm also wondering if there's a timeout handling buglet in the kernel.
Mount options (autofs):
/automounts/netapp    /etc/auto.netapp -soft,rw,bg,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,retry=5,retrans=130,timeo=14,noquota,nosuid
tcpdump output for a large read (zwoln001 is the netapp):

I assume the first timeout is simply due to the read request getting lost - could be n/w or server probs.  Correct?
But the second retry at 18:14:44.200164 looks odd because the read seems to have been satisfied.
A couple of questions:
- How does one enable the 'chatty' mode on the client so we get some syslog output?
- Why are these retries only coming out after 2.8 seconds, when the 'timeo' option was set to 1.4 seconds?
