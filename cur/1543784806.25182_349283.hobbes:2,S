Can you post a small description how to utilize this method?
What I've done lately has been to cp -al your .git archive.
This works well when I get everything merged up and has been my lazy
method to avoid doing merges yet (being cogito user I do not trust merge
atm. because I have mixed up older cogito with newest git).
