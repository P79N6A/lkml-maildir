I haven't checked with Andrew's '-mm' kernels, but AFAICS I'm not seeing
any lingering signed/unsigned warnings in the stock 2.6.0 kernel -
certainly not as many as 1386... (GCC version is latest 3.3.3 prerelease
from Debian).
You mentioned Richard Gooch's name cropping up in the broken code, does
that perhaps mean devfs? If so then the warnings may just reflect the
fact that this code has been unmaintained for too long (devfs has after
all been marked as "obsolete").
Cheers,
