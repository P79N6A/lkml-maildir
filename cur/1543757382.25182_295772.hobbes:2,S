Ok, we may not be over with memory corruption bugs yet. ppc64 now seem
stable running LTP overnight, but my laptop has a page of kernel .text
replaced with zero's as soon as I launch X (and just X, no need to launc
the whole desktop environment).
I suspect remap_pfn_range() but I haven't checked yet.
Ben.
