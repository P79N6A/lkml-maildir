Yeah, I contemplated adding system.fattattrs, system.ntfsattrs, and
system.linuxattrs (for the ext2 attrs that have popped up in several
other filesystems) a while ago, but xattrs seem to be the red-headed
left-handed stepchild of the Linux VFS and I lost interest in the
project.
Nice to see someone else interested in it, though.
