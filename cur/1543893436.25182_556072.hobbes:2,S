Hi!
I have bought recently
00:14.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7134/SAA7135HL Video Broadcast Decoder (rev 01)
        Subsystem: KNC One KNC One TV-Station DVR
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        Memory at d6003000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 1
It was very cheap - 12 euro. I couldn't resist because it has hardware MPEG2 
video and audio encoder. TV is working OK. I have video and analog audio. But 
saa7134-alsa driver wasn't working and audio stream wasn't present in MPEG-TS 
stream. After receiving "User guide" from NXP I have started to dig in driver. 
Problem is caused by ACNI and ACPF not set before snd_card_saa7134_capture_prepare(). 
If I set them manually in this function then DMA capture is starting to working 
and audio stream is present in MPEG-TS. Unfortunatly MPlayer can't play audio 
from this stream. Also I have to set 32.11MHz as master clock, but driver is 
using 24.576MHz for this card? I see that ACNI is set in 
saa7134-tvaudio.c/tvaudio_init(). How it gets cleared? I will dig further, but 
if somebody has any idea...
Would be OK to make saa7134-empress driver MPlayer compatible? All MPlayer needs 
is audio input (now present) and info about current standard. I see that at least 
one other driver has MPlayer compatibility.
Please CC me.
