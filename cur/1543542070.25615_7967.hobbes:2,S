Linus, 
You're right. Starting afresh helps a lot. Everytime!
However, (for example:) the fact that every serial driver in Linux has
to do its own hangup and carrier detect logic stinks.
You've designed good interfaces that allow us to efficiently call the
"write" routine of whatever device we're talking to. 
Similarly, I don't think we should have a quantum.c to talk to Quantum
drives. Talking to quantum drives is similar enough to talking to
maxtor drives that one driver should be able to handle it.
So, it's all a question of degree. 
I think that we need to share more code in the serial driver. Have a
clean interface that reduces most serial drivers by 2000 lines-of-code
or so. Are we at 1 bug per 600 LOC yet? That's three less bugs. 
I agree, maybe we should rethink the IDE driver. But NCR53c875 and
SYM53C895 are close enough to be handled by one driver. So it's a
matter of degree.
				Roger.
