I think this is the wrong way to go about it.  For PCI Express, we
have a defined cross-architecture standard which tells us exactly how
all future PCIe devices will behave in the face of errors.  For PCI and
PCI-X, we have a lot of legacy systems, each of which implements error
checking and recovery in a somewhat eclectic way.
So, IMO, any implementation of PCI error recovery should start by
implementing the PCI Express AER mechanisms and then each architecture can
look at extending that scheme to fit their own legacy hardware systems.
That way we have a clean implementation for the future rather than being
tied to any one manufacturer or architecture's quirks.
Also, we can evaluate it based on looking at what the standard says,
rather than all trying to wrap our brains around the idiosyncracies of
a given platform ;-)

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep
