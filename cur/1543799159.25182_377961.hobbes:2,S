More info.  The vgacon is actually restored by X as vgacon does not
touch the hardware anymore (unless you resize the console with stty). So
any patch that affects X is a culprit.  More specifically, the X driver
used was vesa, which means that the vgacon restoration would be done
using VBE state save and state restore function calls.  With X, this would
involve lrmi (the same library used by vbetool).
I wasn't able to duplicate this problem, using Xorg vesa and vgacon 80x25.
Also, there are no changes to vgacon or to the console that I know of between
the versions he mentioned.
To Jesper,
From your description, I would presume that the VGA fontmap was not
adequately restored.  Can you try changing your system font using whatever
utility is available for your system, such as setfont?  Choose any 8x16 font
in the consolefont directory (It's usually in /usr/share/kbd/consolefont)
