I'll try it after I send this message.  I'm guessing you're refering to
my third bisect.  I still have that and will use it.
I also have my 5th bisect ready for this reboot too...

No serial port on this notebook.  I've tried
"netconsole=4444@192.168.1.9/eth0,6666@192.168.1.3/00:01:02:77:7D:E1" but
nothing happens (there's not even a log message that this is unsupported).

I have been using the Fedora development kernels.  The last I'm SURE I
tested was 2211 (2.6.17-rc4-git11).  It has the same problems as the
2.6.17-rc1 I compiled from the git database.  It's been the same
throughout the series.
I may try sshing into my notebook when I finish these current bisect
tests to see if it's still the HD being made RO.  This is assuming ssh
will keep the connection through a suspend.
