Hi Andi,
This plan makes sense. I will split the "patched in enabled/disable
flags" part into a separate piece (good idea!) and then submit the LTTng
core to Andrew. Christoph's has a good point about wanting a usable
infrastructure to go ini. Regarding your plan, I must argue that
blktrace is not a general purpose tracing infrastructure, but one
dedicated to block io tracing.  Therefore, it makes sense to bring in
the generic infrastructure first and then convert blktrace to it.
