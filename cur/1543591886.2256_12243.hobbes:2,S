IMVHO every developer involved in memory-management (and indeed, any
software development; the authors of ntpd comes in mind here) should
have a 386 with 4MB of RAM and some 16MB of swap. Nowadays I have the
luxury of a 486 with 8MB of RAM and 32MB of swap as a firewall, but it's
still a pain to work with.
