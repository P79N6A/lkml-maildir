Thanks for your reply.
I believe that the linux box couldn't talk to it, but statd has been
running on the other system for the past 3 months (so has lockd)  We
don't get these messages from 2.1.131 (which we just booted back to),
and we have been using NFS locking on this server within the past 30 days.
