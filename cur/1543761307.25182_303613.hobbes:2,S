-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Ralf Baechle DL5RB <ralf@linux-mips.org>
When destroying a socket ax25_destroy_socket tries to stop the protocol's
T1 timer before freeing the memory.  If things are just right using the
non-sync variant of del_timer means the timer will continue to run even
after the del_timer because it's adding itself again which is likely to
result in a crash when the timer is executed again a few seconds later.
del_timer_sync can be expensive, so I don't want this one to go into 2.6
mainline where I'll try to cook something that is less intrusive than
regular calls to del_timer_sync.
