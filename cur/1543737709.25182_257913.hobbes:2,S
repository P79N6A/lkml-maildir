Hi.
I want to use the current cvs of the dxr3 drivers with the 2.6.9-rc3. I 
want to get the modules running with the new rc3 - with your help.
When i load the adv717xa.ko module i get this error:
adv717xa.o: called for an ISA bus adapter?!?
The module loaded very well under 2.6.8.1, so could somebody tell me 
what have exactly changed - i ma not sure what to search for in the 
ChangeLogs.
Here you can look at the module source:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/dxr3/em8300/modules/adv717x.c?rev=1.42&view=auto
Thanks,
Christian
