The main problem I have with this is that e2fsck doesn't know how to
deal with it - at least I haven't found a version that will. This makes
it rather difficult to use, especially for your root fs.
And, since I used it, and have since stopped using it, I have a problem
in what all my disk free space disappears over a couple of days - I have
to run fsck to recover it, were it appears as deleted inodes with zero
dtime. I can't say for sure that the dir index stuff is at fault though.
I am currently using 2.4.6-pre3 without the dir patch installed. I am
using the grsecurity patch though.
I have just upgraded to e2fsprogs-1.21 in the hope of sorting it out. If
that fails I'll revert to a clean 2.4.6-pre kernel. Other ideas welcome.
