I've been compiling and deploying kernels since 0.99 days, and I still get bit 
by this sort of thing. This is one of the reasons why I've liked the minimal 
config option that Rob Landley has proposed a few times wher eyou specify the 
things that you need and let the build system put in the nessasary dependancies.
I started out useing menuconfig, used the TCL based xconfig, but went back to 
menuconfig when the new xconfig came out (I now do most of my kernel compiles on 
remote machines that I may or may not have X access to anyway)
especially if a particular driver/feature doesn't want to compile, tracking down 
how to turn it off can be a pain. The idea that Alan posted of saying 'disabling 
this function will disable the following things as well' would be an extremely 
useful enhancement.
I think that there are more of us out here that configure and compile kernels, 
but aren't kernel hackers then most people (especialy the distros) want to 
admit. (and for that matter, many of the distro support policies activly 
discourage people from telling the distro when they compile a kernel)
