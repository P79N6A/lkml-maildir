That's interesting - what I find dissapointing about the Linux From Scratch
project is that it basically involves first setting up a minimal system, then
booting in to that new system at an early stage to complete the construction
of the system.
Although it lets the user 'escape' their original system quite quickly, my
interest lies more in creating a custom Linux installation using an existing
development environment.

Well, I don't just assume that, but in this case, I think I've demonstrated
to myself that pre-compiled binaries are more difficult to support than
programs compiled from source.
Of course, it's possible to learn a lot about one specific version of one
specific distribution, and doing that might make it easier to support any
pre-compiled binaries in that particular version of that particular
distribution than an installation from source.
However, surely that is just learning about more and more special cases.
It might even be possible to learn about such a large number of special cases
that a user can solve all the problems they encounter without any generic
knowledge of a system, but I think that is a bad thing to encourage.
If I get a phone call asking for help with a program I've never heard of
before, possibly on a distribution I've never heard of before, I belive that
I can offer much better generic advice based on an overall knowledge of the
system if everything is source-based, than if a distribution's pre-compiled
binaries have been installed.  To me, those pre-compiled binaries are
"non-standard".
This is one reason why I do not advertise support services for proprietrary
systems.  I do not want to fix problems by learning about many, many, special
cases - I want to use my generic knowledge of computers to fix problems, and
I believe that it is a better way to use computers in general.

I don't think compiling from source is particularly inpractical on a typical
modern desktop machine today.

That's true for a lot of libraries and basic components of a system, but I
don't think it's so much of a problem in general.

Not too much to make it impractical, in my opinion.

In practice, I haven't found it to be particularly complicated.

It's not.  My 'build system' is basically me sitting at the console.

For the initial installation, maybe not much of an improvement, but for
on-going use of a system, I think compiling from source is better overall.
