The easy solution is 64-bit.  It is particularly easy, considering that
64-bit hardware is mainstream already.  Just get an amd processor,
available in both stationary and portable models.  Even micoroft
has noticed those, and linux support is old.
32-bit will hang on for a while longer in the form of old hardware,
but not likely for another 33 years.
