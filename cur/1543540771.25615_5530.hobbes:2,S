The only ccNUMA ASCI system I know is actually a cluster of 48 128CPU ccNUMAs.
Why?  The Origin 2000 uses directories to avoid broadcasting of invalidates.
For machines larger than 128 CPUs the directories don't have enough bits to
allow a per-node granularity of invalidates, so for systems beyond that size
the hw has to broadcast invalidates into a region of machines thereby
causing an increase of traffic on the internal network.
Directories btw. are fairly expensive but yet a proven way to reduce the
coherency traffic on the internal network.  The extra price is why I don't
believe that we'll see wide offerings of ccNUMAs any time soon.  In fact
even SGI offers two memory configurations (standard / premium) which
implement different size directories and therefore support different
system sizes before having to use coarse invalidates.
