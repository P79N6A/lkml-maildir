Yes.  A clear explanation of the requirements and usecases based on
real-world experience from real-world users and/or application developers. 
I asked Christoph for that last week.  The answers were, iirc, a bit
half-baked, but believeable.

No fair.  I've never worked on big HPC systems and any feedback from the
field which Christoph can provide is really important in helping us
understand what features the kernel needs to offer.  I would expect that
SGI engineering have a better understanding of HPC users' needs than pretty
much anyone else in the world.
It's a shame that SGI engineering aren't better at communicating those
needs to wee little kernel developers.  And we need to get better at this
because, as you say, external policy control is going to be a ton harder to
swallow than /proc/pid/numa_maps.
