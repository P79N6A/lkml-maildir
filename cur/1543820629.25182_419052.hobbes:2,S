Oops, previous message got sent before I had typed anything!
Andi, I just wanted to be clear that my patch is not a VIA workaround,
it is a VIA workaround workaround.  So please don't remove my patch
while leaving in the original VIA workaround.  That will break our
platform, and possibly others.
I don't know if there's an easy way to have both the VIA workaround
(Natalie's original patch) and the VIA workaround workaround (my
patch) in a more unified construct.
I believe our platform would work fine with the removal of my patch
_and_ the VIA patch.  But, as you say, what about VIA?
