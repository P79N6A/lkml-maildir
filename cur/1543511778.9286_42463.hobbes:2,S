This idea came across my yesterday.  How about a file (text or binary) that
lays in /dev (the /dev on the / partition, not a mount) or in /etc  that's
opened up my mount or something and sends that fd to the kernel.  Kernel
reads this file and uses it to keep permissions (mini filesystem w/o a data
area I would assume)
How hard is this to implement?  I believe other programs do this as well
(smbmount comes to mind)
