I noticed this already. Might be a beginning of address space, some kind
of table, might be just empty memory padding pattern, or it might be a
trivial obfuscating XOR of the whole binary.
There are no strings until the end, and the binary is quite
compressible, which is very suspicious, and looks more like obfuscation
than compression.

It seems quite buggy in other respects, too, one day it stopped
accepting any packets through the WiFi interface, even after factory
reset. The WiFi did work, though, I could associate, etc. The other side
worked too. But no data. Then, another day, all was OK again.
