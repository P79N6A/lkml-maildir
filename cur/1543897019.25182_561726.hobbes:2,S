I'm asking .. and axpecting (only) answesr on my question.
*Each* day I have problems with ALSA support and I know some fundamental 
ALSA misdevelopments and few times it was by me (and not only by me) 
presented on lk-ml (try look on lk-ml archive) .. so .. sory but I'm not 
interested on discuss about ALSA v. OSS :> (if you want disccuss about 
this please prepare for this and read anything about subject .. before).
