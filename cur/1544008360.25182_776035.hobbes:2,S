we really only need to mix in the tsc; ktime_get() is just an arch friendly way to get that
I supposed (wrongly).
but yes we need to do a few things
1) seed on demand with a platform time source
2) have a way where arch init can just hand semi random data during the boot process to
    increase the randomness (even if it doesn't count as entropy)
