I'm generally familiar with TCP/IP's algorithms.  The reason I'm asking has
more to do with the fact that Windows 98 and older Linux kernels *work
better*.  I find myself returning to W98 to surf and download because it
makes better use of my time...that's not a situation I like...it's just the
way it works now....and maybe reporting it will help someone.
Can anyone think of a way that the kernels changed in the last few months
that would make "link hogging" worse?  In the meantime, I'll try some of
Alan's suggestions and report any changes.
