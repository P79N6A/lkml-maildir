i'm wondering whether the jiffies update fix from Thomas fixes this bug 
for you.
If not then do you have a serial console enabled?

i've seen something like this on -rt (and incorrectly attributed it to 
-rt) when running on a system which has a serial port and which has a 
kernel console on that serial port. What happens is that after resume 
(and straight after console suspend) every serial character printed 
takes /alot/ of time - and resume does print a number of kernel messages 
to the console. I didnt get any further in debugging this though, but 
disabling the serial console made the problem go away.
a possibly related thing: the serial code is sensitive to jiffies 
updates and timers, i saw that during early revisions of the dynticks 
code - but the specifics escape me.
the slowdown could also be something like the kernel somehow wrapping 
around jiffies and thus doing /alot/ of jiffy ticks? Or it could be a 
miscalculation in the amount of jiffies that need updating, resulting in 
a similar number of loops in the jiffy update code.
(i'll try to figure out this regression - but wanted to describe to you 
the known things so far, maybe you'll figure it out faster than me.)
