The Coverity checker spotted the following two array overflows in 
drivers/net/chelsio/sge.c (in both cases, the arrays contain 3 elements):
<--  snip  -->
...
static void restart_tx_queues(struct sge *sge)
{
...
                                sge->stats.cmdQ_restarted[3]++;
...
static int t1_sge_tx(struct sk_buff *skb, struct adapter *adapter,
                     unsigned int qid, struct net_device *dev)
{
...
                        sge->stats.cmdQ_full[3]++;
...
