It seems that you miss to understand the needed underlying driver structures.
SCSI is not a block layer, it is a generic transport.

I never agued to completely drop support for them. You cannot do decent
DAE with pre-1998 CD-ROM drives, so why try to support DAE for old drives?
Just use them as read-only DA drives.

If you have a IDE tape that acts as tape, it most likely uses SCSI 
tape commands. If it acts as a big floppy, it is not relevent in this
discussion.

Well, from previous discussions with you, you did proove that this is exactly
what _you_ don't understand.
