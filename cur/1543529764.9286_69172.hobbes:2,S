1. Kernel 2.3.51 Doesn't Boot On PowerBook G3
2. The kernel dies on initialization following checks of the hda bus. The
last output is for scsi detection, and then the error message at the end
of the message ensues. I have USB and Appletalk compiled (USB has modules,
Appletalk would only compile in the actual kernel), as well as frame
buffer support, which appears to work (I pass the kernel command line
arguments about the video buffer through BootX).
3. kernel ppc powerbook boot
4. 2.3.51 (self compiled with above options)
5. Here is the death message:

7. Powerbook G3 / 1999. PPC 750@400 mhz. Booting on a 3.8G partition of an
IDE drive on hda9. Connected to speakers, power supply, and 10BaseT
network via the standard BMAC ethernet card.
I hope this is enough to give you some clue. If you want me to do a
specific test, please don't hesitate to ask.
Many thanks,
