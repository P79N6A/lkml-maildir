I have been unable to reproduce your problem here, and I notice you have
the proprietary, highly invasive and closed-source Nvidia driver
installed in your kernel.
Can you try using the "nv" or "vesa" (unaccelerated) Xorg drivers and
reproduce the problem that way?
If you *do* reproduce the problem that way, it would be extremely 
helpful if you could enable CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO and provide the vmlinux 
(not vmlinuz/bzImage) file that goes with the crash dump screenshot.
Thanks!
