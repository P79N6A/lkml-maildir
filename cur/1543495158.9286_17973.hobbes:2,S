Hi,
I'm currently looking at a slightly changed scheduler
design where p->counter and the actual task priority
(which is mainly used for task latency anyway) are
separated and we can get rid of the large recalculation
of all processes' priorities alltogether.
I think this might be worthwhile because the large
recalculation holds the tasklist_lock for a _long_
time, blocking the other CPU's access to the runqueue.
If we smeared out this overhead by adding a new variable
to the task_struct and can simplify goodness() at the
same time, would that be worth it?  -- especially when we
take SMP scalability into account...
cheers,
