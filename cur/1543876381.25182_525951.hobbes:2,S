Problem is that suspending _with_ removable mass storage devices
attached just will not work. User will unplug them, then complain
about corruption. Advanced user will unplug them, work with them
somewhere else, replug them, then loose filesystem.
Feel free to send patch to teach filesystems to handle this.

Check your facts. Laptops do not melt. I know, I put them into my bed,
covered with pillow, and let them complain (evo 560c). ACPI thermals
can handle that.

You have to realize what is possible and what is not.

Yep? Create the filesystem patch, then.

If you don't care or care about your data, feel free to (patch your
kernel to) suspend with removable disks mounted.

You are indeed should know better than speaking like this on lkml.
