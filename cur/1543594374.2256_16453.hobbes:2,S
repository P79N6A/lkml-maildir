For 2.5, I'm planning on switching my driver over to the slab allocator,
for a variety of reasons.  Does anyone have a _dead_ simple example of how
to use such a beast?  I've seen the various web pages and document
explaining the API, but I love to see working examples for reference (and
to fill in the blanks).
