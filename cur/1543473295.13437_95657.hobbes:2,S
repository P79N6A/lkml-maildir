please read very carefully or you don't read at all :)
hm i 've done some lot lot more testing and it's very very strange
not drive,drive is 100% ok :)
boots perfect in 2.0.35+ (sometimes reset drive)
halt in 2.1.129+
interesting is that workaround to boot in linux 2.1.129+
now it is enought to go in CLEAN dos 7.10 (win95 osr2)
on hard disk and then boot in linux with loadlin .
(By CLEAN dos I meant dos without ANY drivers=without
 config.sys and autoexec.com ! )
this 'trick' just wont work if I try boot from floppy same dos 7.1
then loadlin .
Sounds very very stupid but that the way it is !
if you did'n noticed:
ASUS CD ROM 340 SUPPORT UDMA (my board do not suport udma, old vx)
and CD DRIVE work with every atapi driver in dos !
BTW I am sure that this is not hardware bug
if you still thinks so PLEASE read my first letter again !
in 2.0.35+ boots straight !
in 2.1.129+ halts when booted straight
but when I enter in clean dos (not needed atapi driver nor mscdex)
and do loadlin I can boot in 2.1.132 !
Again I repeat that work only from hard disk not floppy, and the
problem is only with kernel 2.1.129+ as I said with
2.0.35+ I DO NOT HAVE  ANY  PROBLEM !
thanks for reading :)
