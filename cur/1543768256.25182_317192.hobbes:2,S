Errr....shut, that was my or your email program screwing
things up...that =20, I mean, that's MIME for line break.

The -1/0/+1 sounds pretty good.

I guess I am still very biased by my implementation, where returning
that was almost free because of how the functions where implemented
(which steamed from the fact that they had to always compute the
new priority to store it in the head).
So as you say, the best way is wrapping your primitives around. I'd
suggest a shorter postfix, something like _prio() or _chkprio().
