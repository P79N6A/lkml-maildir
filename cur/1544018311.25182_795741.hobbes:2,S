Of course, because the oom killer must be aware that tasks in disjoint 
cpusets are more likely than not to result in no memory freeing for 
current's subsequent allocations.

Yes, it is possible to elevate oom_adj scores to override the cpuset 
preference.  That's actually intended since it is now possible for the 
administrator to specify that, against the belief of the kernel, that 
killing a task will free memory in these cpuset-constrained ooms.  That's 
probably because it has either been moved to a different cpuset or its set 
of allowable nodes is dynamic.

A cpuset is a cgroup.  If I am using cpusets, this patch fails to 
adequately allow me to describe my oom preferences for both 
cpuset-constrained ooms and global unconstrained ooms, which is a major 
drawback.
I would encourage you to look at the per-cgroup oom notifier patch[*] that 
defers most of these decisions to userspace.  Given your interest in 
priority based oom preferences as exhibited by your oom_victim patch, I 
think you'll find it of interest since it allows you much greater 
flexibility than you could ever hope for from the kernel's heuristics.
