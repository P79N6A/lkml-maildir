It's simply the imperative. You can make perfectly good English
sentences in just one word -- "Eat." is an example. See more at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood.
It is a bit of a mystery why the kernel is ordering me to initialize
the current offset of xfs_file_readdir though. I don't know how to do
that, so I guess it's lucky that I don't use XFS. Who knows what would
happen if I didn't correctly initialize xfs_file_readdir.
