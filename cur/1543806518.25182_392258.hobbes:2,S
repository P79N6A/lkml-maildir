This happens with the default page size which is 16KB, ie.
IOC4_PRD_ENTRIES=256, the problem is not due to the request
going beyond the number of PRD_ENTRIES. I haven't tried with smaller
page sizes but I would assume the problem would be the same.
Even with this patch performance seems very reasonable.
