Yeah.

So I've been staring at this code for a while and I Just Don't Get It.  If
I want some custom callback function to be called when someone does an
iosem_unlock(), how do I do it?
Or have I misunderstood the intent?  Some /* comments */ would be appropriate..

Commenting the data structures is particularly helpful.

I'd be inclined to call these iosem_init, iosem_waiter_init and
iosem_work_init.

This filename is stale.

I wonder if this lock should be irq-safe everywhere.  Is it not possible
that someone might want to do an unlock from irq context?

Again, some commentary would be needed to help the poor reader understand
what a -EINPROGRESS return means.

Is this BUG_ON() safe?  No locks are held, so couldn't another object get
added by some other thread of control?

Again, I don't understand why this function was created.  I think it means
that there are restrictions upon what keventd can do with iosems, to avoid
deadlocking.  If correct, they should be spelled out.

Ditto.
