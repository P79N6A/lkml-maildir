You'll get ENOTCONN from send, just sendto blocks. select() returns that fd is
ready because this end of socket is ready, and there is probably at least one
UNIX socket on the system which is ready to accept data - so I think that it
is correct that select() returns data ready.
I think that whole problem comes from code's author idea that UNIX datagram 
sockets are equivalent to UDP through localhost while they are completely
different thing.
