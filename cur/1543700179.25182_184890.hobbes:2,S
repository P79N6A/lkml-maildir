To test Linux 2.6.0 durability, we stressed the OS under OSDL-DBT-3
workload for 14 days.
During the test, we did not see any kernel failure.  Linux 2.6.0 passed
the durability test under OSDl-DBT-3 workload.  However, we did wee
performance degradation throughout the test.
For detail of the test, see

If you have any questions/suggestions about the test, please let us
know.
