This situation has been changing rapidly over the last 2 years. Most vendors 
are now forthcoming with specs, and sometimes code, and sometimes even 
hardware samples, often in advance of the hardware hitting the market.
So I think this opinion is being overtaken by events.  Competition is
a good thing: since some vendors now "do the right thing" it seems likely
all will in finite time.
