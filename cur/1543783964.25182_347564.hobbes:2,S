Subject: [PATCH] lost chunk of "uml: build cleanups"

A piece of the UML stubs patch got lost - it has
    Killed STUBS_CFLAGS - it's not needed and the only remaining use had been
    gratitious - it only polluted CFLAGS
in description and does remove it in arch/um/Makefile-x86_64, but forgets to
do the same in i386 counterpart.  Lost chunk follows:
