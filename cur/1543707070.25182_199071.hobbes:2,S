Yes, and? One may expect the echo to give "foo1 foo2", but that depends
on a lot of side effect, such as no other processing doing things in
the current directory. The same is true in a program - if you need
to know whether you could create a file, the only sane way is to use
creat() from an application and look at the return value. No other
method is meaningful - arbitrary things can happen between creating
a file and running readdir().

That way lies madness, I agree. The sane thing (but breaks existing
applications) would be to reject any filename that is not valid
UTF-8, returning -EINVAL. I don't think *that* is going to happen,
though. ;)
