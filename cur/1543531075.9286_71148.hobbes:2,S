Whenever you use the stack, unless you were providing your own,
fixed-size stack.

If your process is actively using the space, it will never be affected
by overcommit anyway.

So overcommit doesn't cause any possible problems.

This has nothing to do withovercommit. Your process may be killed for
a variety of reasons (system low on resources, hostile sysadmin,
system reboot, etc.) but nothing to do with overcommit.
This is true whether overcommit is enabled or not.
