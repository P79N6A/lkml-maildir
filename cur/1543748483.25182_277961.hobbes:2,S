Hey y'all,
    Can anyone point me to a resource for why SO_RCVLOWAT is hardcoded 
to 1 in linux?
If you are using select or poll with timeouts it would be less costly 
to have the kernel tell you
when all of the data you reqested (via SO_RCVLOWAT) is ready to be read 
instead of putting
your select/poll followed by read inside a loop to handle any partial 
data deliveries.  I've got some
code that uses SO_RCVLOWAT running under OS X, and it should run under 
Tru64, but doesn't
do what I want under Linux.  The socket man page indicates that 
SO_RCVLOWAT is hardcoded to 1.
   Please respond to me offline if possible, I don't have the time or 
resources right now to handle the
full subscription to this mailing list.  Thank you.
