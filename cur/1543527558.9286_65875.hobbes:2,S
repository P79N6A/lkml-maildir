Hi,
  in 2.3.47 include/linux/pci.h uses the constant ENODEV but does not
include linux/errno.h causing the compilation of the cmd64x driver to
file.
  I added a #include <linux/errno.h> near the top and all is well.
Dave
P.S. The Alpha thread problem I'd had since the early 2.3.'s seems to have
been fixed in 2.3.4x
