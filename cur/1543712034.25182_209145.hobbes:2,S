That's right.  However, the oops you saw shouldn't happen so long as
intf->cur_altsetting points to something valid.  I got the impression that
in the cdc-acm probe routine maybe it was a null pointer.  Can you insert
a statement in the cdc-acm probe function to print out the values of ifcom
and ifdata, to check that they aren't NULL?  While you're at it also try
printing out the value of ifcom->desc.bNumEndpoints; if that is 0 it will
cause an oops.

It's hard to say without more information.  The contents of 
/proc/bus/usb/devices or the output of lsusb with the phone plugged in 
would help.
