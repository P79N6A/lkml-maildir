definitely agreed. This is the same I was wondering about right now here
while reading his report.
He always get vmalloc failures, this is way too suspect. If the VM
memory balancing was the culprit he should get failures with all the
other allocations too. So it has to be a problem with a shortage of the
address space available to vmalloc, not a problem with the page
allocator.

yes, this will tend to hide it.
Even better would be to change fs/ntfs/* to avoid using vmalloc for tons
of little pieces. It's not only a matter of wasting direct mapped
address space, but it's also a matter of running fast, mainly on SMP
with the IPI for the tlb flushes...
attr.c:233:		new = ntfs_vmalloc(new_size);
attr.c:235:			ntfs_error("ntfs_insert_run:
ntfs_vmalloc(new_size = "
attr.c:458:			rlt = ntfs_vmalloc(rl_size);
inode.c:1297:		rl = ntfs_vmalloc(rlen << sizeof(ntfs_runlist));
inode.c:1638:					rlt =
ntfs_vmalloc(rl_size);
inode.c:1942:		rl2 = ntfs_vmalloc(rl2_size);
inode.c:2006:			rlt = ntfs_vmalloc(rl_size);
super.c:810:				rlt = ntfs_vmalloc(rlsize);
super.c:1335:		buf = ntfs_vmalloc(buf_size);
support.h:29:#include <linux/vmalloc.h>
support.h:35:#define ntfs_vmalloc(size)	vmalloc_32(size)
In short there are three solutions avaialble:
1) don't use ntfs
2) fix ntfs
3) enlarge vmalloc address space with the above patch, but this won't be
   a final solution because you'll overflow again the vmalloc address
   space by adding the double of files in your fs
So I'd redirect this report to Anton Altaparmakov <aia21@cam.ac.uk> and
I still have no VM bugreport pending from my part.
thanks,
Andrea
