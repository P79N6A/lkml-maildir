None of your comments actually address the thing that he was having
problems with:
ifneq ($(call cc-ifversion, -lt, 0303, "bad"),)
$(error Sorry, GCC v3.3 or above is required.)
endif
Now, compiler.h has some checks like:
#elif __GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 2
# include <linux/compiler-gcc3.h>
#else
# error Sorry, your compiler is too old/not recognized.
#endif
But it doesn't permit us to rule out gcc 3.3 unless we patch compiler.h.
There's no asm/compiler.h, for example.  Obviously, we could put some
tests for compiler version in arch/parisc somewhere.  Where's the right
place these days?
