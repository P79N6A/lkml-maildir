Yes I have noticed that too. It was fine with 2.6.15 - I could compile a 
kernel, move the binary result and the source tree a little around, wrap it 
up in an rpm package, install it elsewhere, and upon changing options in 
.config, it only recompiled the important bits. With 2.6.16-rc1 it seems to 
always rebuild everything. (I doubt CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CONNMARK 
influences kernel/exit.o!)
