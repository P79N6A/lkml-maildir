It is confusing: tmpfs is used both for abstracting POSIX shared memory
(shm) and for a page-cache-based dynamic RAM disk.  The line above, that
you are adding, is for the shm support.  You need to add another line to
create the tmpfs filesystem at a given mount point.  Example:
tmpfs		/var/cheese	tmpfs	defaults,size=4m	0 0
Would create a tmpfs at /var/cheese.  The (optional) size parameter
specifies a maximum fs size of 4MB.
See Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt for more information.
