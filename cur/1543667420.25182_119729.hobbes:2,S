Very few cards actaully use a VBL. Each driver also should provide its own 
interrupt handler. Plus the "generic" vbl handler should NOT be calling 
accel_cursor. Instead talking to the low level cursor handler instead. I 
plan to do that next. I haven't got around to fixing that yet. I will in 
the next release.
