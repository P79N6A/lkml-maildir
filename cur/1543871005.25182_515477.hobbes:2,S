Also, now that I think of it, if resize performance is far far less
important than read-side performance, then you should be able to get
away without the additional smp_rmb() that I add to the read-side
in the algorithm I described.
All you have to do is introduce an additional RCU grace period between
assigning the old pointer to the current table, and the current pointer
to the new table. This will still ensure that an (old_table == NULL &&
cur_table == new_table) condition is impossible (that condition would
mean that one of our active tables is invisible to the reader).
This should truely reduce read-side fastpath overhead to just a single,
predictable branch, an extra read_mostly load or two and the rcu_blah()
bits.
