Sorry man. The behaviour is worse than before, but I expected that :)
It kills sshd, the application, the controlling terminal and some other
innocent processes like hotplug. 
Take a decent UP machine enable PREEMPT and start # hackbench NN , where
NN is a number of processes, which exhausts the memory of the machine
and see yourself.
If there is the point where memory is exhausted you have to kill a
process _and_ wait until the memory is freed before even thinking about
another invocation of oom_kill().
There is usually more than one process on a machine which requests
memory. So as long as the first kill did not proceed to the point where
the memory is actually freed, you will call out_of_memory() from
different processes or kernel functions and make the machine less usable
than neccecary.
The oom_kill is invoked about 100 times. It ends up killing hotplug when
already 112MB memory are available. See below.
I agree, that the timed hack stuff in out_of_memory is ugly, but we need
some mechanism to avoid 
	1. reentrancy into oom_kill
	2. invocation of oom_kill until the already killed process
	   has finally released memory.
Further we need a better selection of whom to kill.
