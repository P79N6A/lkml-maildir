How would that work? You would adjust the power cap dynamically during
runtime based on the power meter feedback?  How long would 
the adjustment interval be?

Not sure affected CPUs is accurate enough for your purposes anyways.
It cannot express "other core can be independent if I'm idle, otherwise not"
which is common on Intel systems.
