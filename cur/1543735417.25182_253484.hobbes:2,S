Hi!
I'm talking about uservfs.sf.net, aka podfuk, which implements tarfs
(and more).

It needs to run as root. If there's bug in tar, that script kiddie is going
to get your users anyway. Audit the code.

If there's a bug in tar, I can do a lot of interesting things. Audit tar.

FUD. Fix tarfsd if its problem.

Coda solves this: all writable things are file-backed on file in /tmp =>
bad performance if you only need piece of very large file,
but no deadlocks.

See sources. It is <1000 lines of code.
