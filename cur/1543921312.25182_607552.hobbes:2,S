While I think this is good otherwise, why does it do
	printk(".. comm: %.*s .."
		TASK_COMM_LEN, current->comm,
instead of just using "%s" and "current->comm"? I only noticed because 
there was an unrelated conflict around that thing.
That "current->comm" had better be NUL-terminated already, we use it as 
such all over the place. And if it's not, *that* should be fixed.
I'm editing it back to the simpler pure string.
