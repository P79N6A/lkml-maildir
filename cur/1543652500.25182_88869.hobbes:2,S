Thanks to YOSHIFUJI Hideaki / 吉藤英明, I had a look at rtnetlink.  It
seems like we would get the necessary address setting functionality if
I implemented the following:
  1. Add an RTM_SETLINK message type that handles at least the
     IFLA_ADDRESS attribute.  This would replace SIOCSIFHWADDR for
     interfaces with long hardware addresses.
  2. Add code to handle receiving RTM_NEWNEIGH and RTM_DELNEIGH
     messages from user space.  This would replace SIOCSARP and
     SIOCDARP for interfaces with long hardware addresses.
Dave, Alan, if I wrote a patch to do this would you accept it?  (And
following that increase MAX_ADDR_LEN?)
(By the way the original patch I posted added code to the
SIOCSIFHWADDR/SIOCGIFHWADDR handler to prevent a long hardware address
from overrunning the ifr_data member that user space passed in)
Thanks,
  Roland
