Less impressed.  It (still) adds a very large amount of tricksy code which
pokes around in core pagecache functions, slows down the radix-tree
hotpath, exports mysterious symbols.  And that's on a 60-second scan. 
It'll be a sizeable job going through it in detail.  Not as sizeable as
writing it though ;)
All of this for an undisclosed speedup of AFS!
I think we need an NFS implementation and some numbers which make it
interesting.  Or at least, some AFS numbers, some explanation as to why
they can be extrapolated to NFS and some degree of interest from the NFS
guys.   Ditto CIFS.
Because it _is_ a lot of code.
