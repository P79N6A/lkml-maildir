I am one of those ancient programmers :-) who
still hasn't heard a good excuse for not checking
malloc() returns (kmalloc in this case) for NULL.
The difference in 2.2 seems to be an increased
probability of kmalloc(..., GFP_DMA) returning
NULL.
As for the design of the SCSI sub-system, I quite
like it and give credit to Drew and Eric for that.
Given the relatively short time scales they are
talking about for the 2.3 series of kernels it seems
as though we will be living with this design into
2.4 . Doug Ledford seemed to suggested that the whole
sub-system was going to be re-designed in 2.3 but
my guess is that it is already too late for that.
The CAM design from a Linux point of view looks
like "throw the whole thing out and start again".
This seems to be what they did in FreeBSD.
So how about a spot of strengthening of the design
we have in Linux? I have 2 suggestions:
 - increase the sense buffer from 16 to 32 bytes
   (that way we at least comply with SCSI 2)
 - add an "actual bytes tranfered" count into
   the same structure
