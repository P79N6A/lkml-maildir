Yep, my rule is that if ever the DMA zone is reclaimed for watermark, it will
be running wild ;) So I leave it out by setting classzone_idx=0, and let the
age balancing code to catch it up. This scheme works fine: tested to be OK from
64M to 2G memory.

That's months ago, if I remember it right, the number of concurrent readers the
adaptive read-ahead code can handle without much thrashing was raised from ~100
to 800 with the balancing work.
This is my original announce back then:
    The page aging problem showed up when I was testing many slow reads with
    limited memory. Pages in the DMA zone were found out to be aged about 3
    times faster than that of Normal zone in systems with 64-512M memory.
    That is a BIG threat to the read-ahead pages. So I added some code to
    make the aging rates synchronized. You can see the effect by running:
    $ tar c / | cat > /dev/null &
    $ watch -n1 'grep "age " /proc/zoneinfo'
    There are still some extra DMA scans in the direct page reclaim path.
    It tend to happen in large memory system and is therefore not a big
    problem.
And here is some numbers collected by Magnus Damm:
