Totally sure :-)
#0 0x40053f0f in __pthread_create_2_1 (thread=0x40244fc4, attr=0x40244fc8,
thread = 0x40244fc4 and attr=0x40244fc8, both parameters are inside a class 
of type MCThread, which begins with:
class MCThread {
protected:
         pthread_t m_thread;
         pthread_attr_t m_thread_attr;
Class is correctly allocated with "new", and also remember that the daemon 
runs without any problem and in a production environment with kernel 2.4.9 
and lowers.
Thank you very much,
