Greetings!  I'm currently working on a PIII/kni enhanced atlas blas
library for Linux.  I've gotten some useful correspondence from Doug
Ledford regarding the current PIII patch, and am running user code
successfully now with a few minor problems.  And of course, the
performance improvements can be tremendous here.
Will there be userland support (as apart from kernel optimizations)
for kni in the mainstream kernel soon?  If not, are there any
remaining issues with userland kni currently known that are preventing
this capability from being included?  I'd like to assist where
possible in this effort.
Thanks!
