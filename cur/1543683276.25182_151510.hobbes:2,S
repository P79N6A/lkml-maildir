I thought select is supposed to tell you when you can read/write at least something without
failing.  Otherwise it would be worthless when doing non-blocking IO because you can
both read and write w/out blocking at all times.  If you run similar code on a tcp
socket instead of std-out, do you see the same busy spin?  (To do it right, make
sure the network between source and destination is slower than the CPU can handle,
ie 10bt hub.)
