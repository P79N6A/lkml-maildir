The penguin(s) in 2.1 kernels originally were on the left side.
I really liked it, but I missed the scrollback a lot, so I hacked fbcon.c
and moved the penguin to the right side and reenabled the scrollback for the
left side of the lines.
On the other hand, it was rather a hack, which turned out to work for most
people, so it was integrated into the kernel. On the other hand, there's a
much cleaner method of allowing scrollback now, and the penguin was moved
back to the left side.

Ctrl-S (=XOFF) or Scroll-Lock will stop the processes from outputting to the
terminal and Ctrl-Q (=XON) or SCroll-Lock again will reenable it.
Use Ctrl-S and Ctrl-PgUp to scroll back.
Hope this helps,
