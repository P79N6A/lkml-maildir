Is support for the soundblaster 16 broken in 2.4.0test7/8.  Whether I
compile sb support into the kernel or as a module, it always fails to
load.  I have a non-pnp genuine soundblaster 16.  The module always
fails to load saying that I specified the wrong io/irq/etc.  The
parameters are correct though.  The module loads fine with 2.3.99preX
kernels and 2.2 kernels.  Has there been a change to the 2.4 kernels
that requires some special configuration for sound, or a change to the
modules.conf?  If I compile sb support into the kernel and specify the
parameters to the kernel it also fails to detect the card.  
I'm using modutils 2.3.16.  I updated from 2.3.15 because 2.3.15 had
trouble finding the dependencies for usb modules.  everything else works
fine.
Any thoughts?
Alex
