Aah, sorry for the question, you use 2.6.18.1 and there is no such option yet.
Despite you have ide-generic built-in and other drivers have as a
module and you don't use initrd. If I was you, I'll try to disable
ide-generic and choose your ide chipset as built-in in
ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support under Device drivers.
