Hi!  
	I have tried yesterday Framebuffer for ATI Mach64. 
	The console turns out very beautiful. 
	But why is supported only ATI, Matrox or VESA 2.0? 
	How about S3 (Trio, Virge, V2/DX)? 
	In kernel there are these of the driver, but only not for x86. 
	It seems S3 very much distributed chipset, at least at us so.
