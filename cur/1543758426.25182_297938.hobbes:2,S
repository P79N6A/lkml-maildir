It happened when some pages of IO from a dm device were bounced.  It
looks to me when bio's are cloned in the dm code to split it for
physical devices that only the pointers to pages that apply to that
device are copied and th bi_idx is adjusted to point to the start,
leaving some NULL pointers at the start of the bio_vec.
