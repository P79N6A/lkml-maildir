rmb() should be replaced with mb() (SMP race).
About the design it doesn't solve anything as you still wait 10msec for a
net_bh() if you get a secondary nested network irq in the middle of the bh
processing. You run net_bh at max one time per loop so you still can
return with NET_BH marked as with 2.2.14pre12.
