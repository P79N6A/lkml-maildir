Your patch looks wrong (ook ook! 8)) - if you build without BUG enabled you
don't make various function calls with your change. BUG_ON has the C nasty
assert() does that makes it a horrible horrible idea and its unfortunate
it got put in.
	BUG_ON(function(x,y))
ends up not causing function to be called when not debugging
The classic C mess people get into is similar with things like
	assert(x++ == 4);
