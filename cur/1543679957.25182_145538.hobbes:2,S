I don't think mp3 playing needs nothing special.
Mp3 decoding on today's computers taks insignificant amounts of cpu time.
Having mp3 skips even in light loads in a 2x800 box seems just
unacceptable. 
If you allow users using SCHED_RR, every app will end using it.
But you can renice all other apps at +5. 
Scheduler's behaviour has been much better in the past, i don't
think it requires anything special, just fixing the bug.
But if you want to hear mp3 under crazy loads; perhaps you'd want to use
the SCHED_RR part. 
Personally I'd like to be able to hear mp3 always, no matter if there's a
heavy load in the machine. Mp3 playing is _important_ for me, i don't care
about the rest :) (xmms supports realtime, but you need root)
