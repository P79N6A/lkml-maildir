This solves the original symptom, but I'm seeing something else now.  
After the second resume, there's a noticable pause after it brings cpu 1 
online.  After the third resume it's a longer pause, and after the 4th 
it just hangs there.  The system is up enough to respond to sysreq, but 
nothing in usermode seems to be actually running.  I'll try and get a 
better understanding of what I'm seeing later today.
