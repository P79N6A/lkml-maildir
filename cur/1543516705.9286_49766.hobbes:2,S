Subject: Very low performance NFS between 2.2.13 & 2.2.38

I'm experiencing very low performance using NFS between a 2.2.13
and 2.3.28 system.
Both systems use Dec Tulip based cards, and had long been talking
successfully via NFS when both were 2.2.13.
Things still work, just very slowly.
It seems to me I must have missed something someplace.
Can someone give me a pointer?
Thanks,
