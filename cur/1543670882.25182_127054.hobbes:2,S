The reference implementation for a filesystem is ext2fs, which
you can have a look at in fs/ext2 on a unpacked kernel tree.
Have also a look at fs/ramfs which is a bit simpler but does
not deal with block devices.
Also have a look at the linux-kernel and linux-fsdevel mailing list
archives.
Greets, Antonio.
