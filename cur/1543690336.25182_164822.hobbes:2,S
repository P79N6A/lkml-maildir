I could do it only if there was an effective reason to do it. 
And there isn't.
They have just posted me a message with pipe latency under kernel 2.4.
And it is exactly the same (apart some minor variations in misurements 
that are natural enough).

I consider my work finished.
I studied an efficient IPC mechanism and I tried to implement it 
on an existing Operating System.
I tried some other IPC primitives in benchmark tests 
and reported the comparisons between completion times.
I got my goal.

I'm not a kernel developer. Ask Linus Torvalds.
