    I don't know. Look at the output of your netstat command. If you
have connections in the CLOSE_WAIT state related to the NAT gateway,
it may be the cause :? But anyway the effect is just the opposite. Is
not CLOSE_WAIT state that hangs a program, but a hung program (or at
least one not doing its duty) which puts a connection in CLOSE_WAIT
state.
    Hope this helps.
