Subject: [PATCH 00/16] raid acceleration and asynchronous offload api for 2.6.22
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/2/58

I am pleased to release this latest spin of the raid acceleration
patches for merge consideration.  This release aims to address all
pending review items including MD bug fixes and async_tx api changes
from Neil, and concerns on channel management from Chris and others.
Data integrity tests using home grown scripts and 'iozone -V' are
passing.  I am open to suggestions for additional testing criteria.  I
have also verified that git bisect is not broken by this set.
The short log below highlights the most recent changes.  The patches
will be sent as a reply to this message, and they are also available via
git:
	git pull git://lost.foo-projects.org/~dwillia2/git/iop md-accel-linus
Additional comments and feedback welcome.
Thanks,
Dan
