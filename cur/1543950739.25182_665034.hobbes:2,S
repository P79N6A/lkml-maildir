The new "hook" is that we now have ways of setting different maps, and
you added a whole infrastructure to set these permissions from
userspace, as well as track them within the kernel.  That's a security
policy that you are putting into place within the kernel, just like LSM
is supposed to be used for.

Do you really want to run other LSMs within a containerd kernel?  Is
that a requirement?  It would seem to run counter to the main goal of
containers to me.

The last time this was brought up, it was not noticable, except for some
network paths.  And even then, the number was lost in the noise from
what I saw.  I think with a containered machine, you have bigger things
to be worried about :)

No, your lsm would be your "virtualize" policy.  I don't think you would
have to do any additional work here, but could be wrong.  Would like to
see the code to prove it.

Yes, but your LSM hooks will be smaller than the code modifications to
the map logic :)
Again, I object to this as you are driving a new security policy
infrastructure into the device node logic where it does not belong as we
already have this functionality in the LSM interface today.  Please use
that one instead and don't clutter up the kernel with "one-off" security
changes like this one.
Please try the LSM interface and see what happens.  If, after you have
created a patch, you still have objections, please post it for review
and I will be glad to revisit my opinion at that time.
