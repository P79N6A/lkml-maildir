Subject: [PATCH] driver for DiskOnChip Millennium Plus and INFTL

Hi All,
Here is a patch that adds support to the kernel MTD drivers
for the M-System's Disk-On-Chip Millennium Plus family of
devices. It also contains an INFTL (Inverse NAND Flash Translation
Layer) driver as well.
You can get it at either of:
  
ftp://ftp.snapgear.org/pub/patches/mplus-20030414.patch.gz
  
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/misc/mplus-20030414.patch.gz
This patch is against Linux-2.4.20 source.
The Millennium Plus register map is quite different to their
other devices, and so needs a new sub-driver. The INFTL layer
is also quite different to their older NFTL code, so a new
sub-driver for that too.
This code is all GPL (with the blessing of M-System), and based
on the existing Disk-On-Chip support in MTD.
Regards
Greg
