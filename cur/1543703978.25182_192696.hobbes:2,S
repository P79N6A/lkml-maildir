OK, so lets assume this scenarion:
process A affined to cpu1
all other processes affined to 0xffffffff
cpu1 goes down
 - process A affined to 0xffffffff
hotplug "cpu1 removed" event
cpu1 comes back
hotplug "cpu1 inserted" event
Process A has now discarded useful potentially VALUABLE information, with no
way to retrieve it.  The hot plug scripts do not have enough information to
put things the way they were before.  I can't believe that anyone considers
this to be OK.
Userspace gave us EXPLICIT instructions, which we then violate.  By granting
affinity, we have made a contract with userspace.  Changing affinity without
userspace's direct instruction is wrong.
What about this:
We already can not handle unexpected CPU removals gracefully, correct?  So
we expect some user-provided notification, right?
So force userland to handle it before we give the OK to remove a CPU.
pid_t sys_proc_offline(int cpu)
{
	pid_t p;
	/* flag cpu as not schedulale anymore */
	dont_add_tasks_to(cpu);
	p = find_first_unrunnable(cpu);
	if (p)
		return p;
	take_proc_offline(cpu);
	return 0;
}
 
The userspace control can then loop on this until it returns 0.  Each time
it return a pid, userspace must try to handle that pid - kill it, 
re-affine it, or provide some way to suspend it.
Simpler yet:
int sys_proc_offline(int cpu, int reaffine)
{
	pid_t p;
	/* flag cpu as not schedulale anymore */
	dont_add_tasks_to(cpu);
	while ((p = find_first_unrunnable(cpu))) {
		if (reaffine)
			reaffine(p);
		else
			make_unrunnable(p);
	}
	take_proc_offline(cpu);
	return 0;
}
Less flexible, but workable.  I prefer the first.  Yes it's racy, but the
worst case is that you receive a pid that you don't need to handle (died or
re-affined already).
Anything that violates affinity without permission just is so WRONG.
