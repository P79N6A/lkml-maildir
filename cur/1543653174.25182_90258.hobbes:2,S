Subject: [BUG][PATCH] files on readonly filesystems could be truncated (patch for cramfs)

Hi,
This patch solves the 2 problems:
1) cramfs is not marked readonly and it is possible to
   truncate files on it. This part is obvious and trivial.
2) Even setting MS_RDONLY in cramfs_read_super is not enough,
   since remount -wno remount still makes it possible (the same
   seems to be valid for all readonly filesystems).
   I solved it implementing super_operations.remount_fs.
   Is it a desired way of solving the problem ? If so,
   i could do the same for the others as well (isofs, romfs).
Although patch was diffed against 2.4.3, it still applies (at least
against 2.4.20-rc1).  Bug is present in 2.4 as well as in 2.5.
        Regards,
                        pkx
