Hi:
I am writing a kernel module for assging an ip address to an interface.
I  have included linux/igmp.h but still whenever i use the function
declared in  igmp.h file, it says unresolved symbol for that function.
I am new to this programming.
i use the following command to compile it:
gcc -c -D__KERNEL__   -DMODULE
-I/home/newkernelsource/linux-2.4.22/include  hello.c
