Nothing from asm/bitops.h should ever be used in userspace.

Correct. And the depedency to bitops.h in case of __KERNEL__ = 1 should
not be there either, in particular since __FD_SET/__FD_CLR do not have
to be atomic. A simple piece of C code should be used instead of
set_bit/clear_bit.

It should not hurt. s390 always used a glibc with a major >= 2.
