I think we really do need to introduce pci_name() for 2.6 (and put it
in 2.4 too).  We don't need to eliminate pci_dev->slot_name for 2.6,
but drivers that care need to be able to tell the user which card is
a message is referring to.  With overlapping pci bus numbers, the 8
bytes of bus:device.func is no longer unique, so we need to report the
domain number too.
That information's already placed in bus_id, but as I said, I don't
want to start converting all the drivers.  We could just make slot_name
larger (Anton posted a patch for this) but I don't want to make pci_dev
even bigger.  Having a nice interface like pci_name() makes drivers more
portable between 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8 (as Jeff pointed out).
