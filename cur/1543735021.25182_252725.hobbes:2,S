You can only see your own namespace.  So e.g. /proc/mtab is your name
space's mount table and you can rescan that when receiving the mount
signal.
That is sort of the coolness of this approach - push the payload out to
user-space, and we don't have to worry about things like information
leak, name spaces, security, etc.  We are just providing a notify
mechanism for state information that should already be exposed through
sysfs.
So there is no information leak.
