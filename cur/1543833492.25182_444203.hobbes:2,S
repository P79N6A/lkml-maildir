Christoph, IMO even then we wont deadlock, because in the case of a
remote free when there are no alien caches, we simply take the remote
node's list_lock and free the object, directly in the remote slab.

Yes we do need to, there can be a case when all cpu's of a node have
gone down, we free the alien cache, and this alien cache might have
come from this cache itself, (see cpuup_callback).  In this case we
will find the alien caches to be absent and then we will directly free
to the remote nodes slab.

A computer scientist is someone who, when told to "Go to Hell," sees
the "go to," rather than the destination, as harmful.
