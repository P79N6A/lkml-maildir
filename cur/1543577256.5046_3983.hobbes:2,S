Subject: 2.4.0-Prerelease :smp_num_cpus undefined while compiling without smp for  Athlon

in smp.h macro
#define smp_num_cpus
etc...
have no effect on the kernel_stat.h file .
if might be undefined or declared elsewhere as an int or such...I added
#define smp_test_num_cpus
and replaced the occurence in kernel_stat.h and it worked ok
and tried to find where the smp_num_cpus define was getting screwed...
no success.
this have the effect of unbuildable kernel with options: smp off and
athlon on, i don't know about other problematic configurations.
I have gcc version 2.96
and make 3.78.1
