this patch works well... I can now boot my PowerMac 7300 using
2.6.10-rc2-bk8 (that I got on kernel.org) with this patch...
but I still has some problem with my Matrox Millenium PCI card using
matroxfb driver... the kernel boot... but I get corrupted characters on
the console... X load ok and display ok...
It works really well with the onboard video (controlfb driver)
matroxfb driver works fine on 2.6.8
