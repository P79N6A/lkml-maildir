This version works a lot better than the previous one(s). My P4,
which suspends/resumes via apm just fine with UP_APIC, survived
two suspend/resume cycles with this patch: one synchronous
(apm --suspend), and one asynchronous (short press on power button).
Not having IDE oops in a BUG_ON() is a definite improvement.
I had to add an #include <linux/device.h> to apm.c, a patch hunk
failed in oprofile, and there are some cosmetic things I don't like.
I'll merge this with my previous version tomorrow.
