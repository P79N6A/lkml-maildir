No, it's not, and deadlock is definitely possible. However, if we're at
the point where memory is tight enough that it's an issue, the timer can
expire and all the pending i/o is dropped just as it would be without
the multipath code enabled.
I'm not saying it's a solution ready for production, just a good
starting point.
