   I'm still not sure why it's been decided not to do fallback or how
   this whole situation is any different from path MTU discovery.
We don't use fallbacks for path MTU discovery (I assume you are
referring to black hole detection, we don't do it, never have never
will), you have to explicitly turn path-mtu discovery off.  It's been
on by default for 3 or 4 years now :-)
