the bugcheck was for NULL ->mapping in page_remove_rmap:
	BUG_ON(!page->mapping);
I tend to forget the ! in the pseudocode in emails sorry (today I did it
twice, luckily I didn't get it wrong in the actual patches ;).

as you say vmtruncate zaps the pte _first_, so the page->mapcount should
be down to 0 by the time we set page->mapping = NULL. 
the thing I was wondering about is the controlled race where some page
can go out of pagecache despite still being mapped somewhere, that could
happen in the past IIRC.
