I re-checked the logfile and it looks like the read request (or open request)
is in fact failing, so something should be done. The apache-log looks like:
[Mon Mar 17 22:55:56 2003] [crit] [client w.x.y.z] (17)File exists: /a/b/c/d/e
pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable
The corresponding nfs message is:
Mar 17 22:55:55 me kernel: nfsd-fh: found a name that I didn't expect: c/d
