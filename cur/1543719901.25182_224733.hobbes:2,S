   which kernel are you using and what are the sata related settings?
   I have intel D865PERL with same sata controller as your friend, using 
kernel 2.6.5, sata configured as scsi:
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y
CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX=y
   I have both ide (/dev/hd[a-d]) and sata disks (/dev/sda1), all 
visible (two HDs on first ide controller, cd burner and dvd on second 
ide controller, HD on SATA)
   with 2.4.x kernels you might need some patches, the first 2.4.x 
kernel  I know supports SATA is 2.4.21-ac4, plus you (your friend) need 
libata5 patches for SATA disks over 137GB.
