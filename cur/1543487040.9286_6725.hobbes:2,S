This is not at all linux-kernel related.  It should not be posted here.

What you are seeing here is the result of fact that 2.4 can't be
represented exactly in the binary notation that floating point uses.
This is basically the same as not being able to exactly represent 1/3
in decimal notation (with a fixed number of digits).
The other thing you are seeing is that x86 floating point processors
hold "temporary" calculations in 80-bit format, while a double is only 64 
bits.  This makes serious numerical analysis a real pain in the ass,
and can make even simple programs like yours give surprising results.
This is really the fault of both Intel and gcc.  Intel didn't design
the x86 to allow true 64-bit only math and uses 80-bit "temporaries"
as a default. Gcc leaves the 80-bits as a default, and there isn't any
"easy" way of switching to Intel's "almost IEEE754 64-bit" mode.  The
only option that comes close to turning off this "feature" is the
-ffloat-store option, which causes massive slowdowns.
Note that simply changing the optimization levels can the results that 
you see 'cause the "temporary 80-bit" values will be used at different 
times.

You probably got lucky that it produced "correct" results.  The MS
compiler does have an option to uses Intel's "almost IEEE754 64-bit"
mode, but IIRC, it is off by default.
