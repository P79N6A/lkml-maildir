Yes, that is correct.

The old staging.git tree is obsolete, I need to go delete the thing,
sorry about that.

Yes, that is exactly the thing to do.
Or, you can grab the linux-next tree and send me patches against that,
as it includes my staging patch set inside of it and it is resynced
every night.
So, if you like git, you might want to stick with linux-next and use
that to send me staging patches.
Hope this helps,
