Speaking from personal experience, _waay_ too many.  On my old G4  
which now serves as a fileserver, I have 5 IDE busses out of 3  
controllers (Onboard ATA-66 with 2 busses, onboard ATA-33 with one  
bus, add-in PCI ATA-100 with 2 busses)  There's a _config_ option to  
control probe order specific to the two Apple onboard interfaces, and  
it used to be (before udev) that option was a nightmare to ensure  
that my new kernel has the same probe order as the old one.  Once you  
throw PCI hotplug into the mix, reliable probing order is impossible,  
and you should just use udev to dynamically assign names.

Yeah, 2.4 was bad at hotplug, everybody knows that already.  This is  
why the changes were made for 2.6 to add udev and hal and make it  
much saner.
