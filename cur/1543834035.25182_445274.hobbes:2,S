 Quite simply, the damn thing is 350 km away from where I am, and I
can't just shut it down completely to reinstall or better yet swap it
with some decent and newer hardware. So I found that FC1 could be
upgraded with a 2.6 fedora RPM and found the 'nearest' at fedora
legacy and upgrade the kernel in 5 minutes.
Essentialy I'd like to find some confirmation/pointer regarding 1) if
the bug really affects my chipset 2) if 2.6.10 still has the fix, it
should have it of course, but...
