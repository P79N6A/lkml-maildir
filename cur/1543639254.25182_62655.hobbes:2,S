I do have some other core PCI changes, but they're nothing major:
- exporting a few more things (e.g. pci_scan_bridge, pci_setup_bridge)
- changing some things from __init to __devinit
- adding new functions pci_find_bus, pci_do_max_busnr, and pci_max_busnr
Probably the most "interesting" code is a change I made to
arch/i386/kernel/pci-irq.c to have pci_lookup_irq try to recursively
find the parent slot in the IRQ routing table, via a new helper
function pirq_get_parent_info.  This allows the IRQ assignment driven
by pci_enable_device to work with devices behind bridges on cPCI
peripheral cards.  This new code is currently conditional under
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI (probably _CPCI once I get my config changes done).
I can totally understand not wanting to destabilise 2.4, and I can
live with having my own 2.4 cPCI tree up on bkbits if you don't want
to pull these changes in.  Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to
do any serious testing on 2.5, since I'm under the gun to deliver
cPCI hotswap as part of a complete 2.4 based production system in
another couple months.

Okay, I might start pick at this on my vacation if I can get my hands on
a half-decent laptop.
