And I'm saying that this requirement from the standard means that an
extra instruction needs to be inserted to do the & 0xffffffff on the
intermediate on Alpha. 
This is a performance impact, which the ansi guys tried to prevent in
most cases. They carefully wrote "undefined" in all cases where
implementation details would change the results, trying to allow
compiler writers to optimze for the common case.
