Yes, there were more in /var/log/syslog:
Mar  2 15:16:45 darkstar kernel: radeonfb: Reference=27.00 MHz (RefDiv=12) Memory=325.00 Mhz, System=200.00 MHz
Mar  2 15:16:45 darkstar kernel: radeonfb: PLL min 20000 max 40000

Mar  2 15:16:45 darkstar kernel: radeonfb 0000:01:00.0: Failed to register I2C bus monid.
Mar  2 15:16:45 darkstar kernel: i2c-algo-bit.o: crt2 seems to be busy.
Mar  2 15:16:46 darkstar kernel: radeonfb 0000:01:00.0: Failed to register I2C bus crt2.
Mar  2 15:16:46 darkstar kernel: Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 90x25
Mar  2 15:16:46 darkstar kernel: radeonfb (0000:01:00.0): ATI Radeon AP
Do the "seems to be busy." and/or "Failed to register I2C bus" 
indicate a problem ?
There's nothing about radeonfb in dmesg because I manually 
loaded the modules.
I now compiled built-in with debug enabled and got the same 
problem. Nothing got logged. Everything seems to stop when it 
blanks, but SysRq works.
