In particular, the interrupt stack is the kernel stack of the current 
task. This is (in part) what leads to stack overflows. If the current 
task is running in the kernel, using a significant hunk of its stack, 
an interrupt is limited to the balance of that stack. And if that 
interrupt triggers a soft irq that runs, say, a network stack, and 
that softirq handler in turn gets interrupted, we've got, 
effectively, three processes sharing the stack. And of course hard 
interrupts can be nested, so it's pretty damn difficult to specify a 
safe upper limit for stack usage.
