Hi,
I used two MSI 8533 mobos for our 1U rack servers.
These mobos are for P4 and uses SiS 5513 chipset.
They have integrated VGA and NIC (RTL8139).
When I boot 2.4.19 or 2.4.20rc2 with IO-APIC enabled
the NIC doesn't work. It get IRQ 18 (instead of
IRQ 11 in non-ioapic mode) but IRQ routing is bad
because it got no irqs at that line.
When booting kernel complaints that APIC is unknown
and that I should write to linux-smp@vger.kernel.org.
I tried to use pirq=0,0,0,0,0,11 which assigns IRQ 11
to NIC but still it got no interrupts.
In order to keep this mail short, I placed dmesg,
lspci -vv and cat /proc/interrupts from all three
cases (noapic, apic, pirq) at:
http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/tmp/apic/
Let me know if I can do more (root access to the machine
would be possible during this week).
I'd appreciate if you Cc me in replies.
Best regards,
