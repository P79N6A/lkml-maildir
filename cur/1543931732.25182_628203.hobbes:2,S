I added CONFIG_BUG, and I think the current behavior is correct. As
you've noticed, we have to evaluate condition, it may have
side-effects. And if code does:
	/* this indicates a driver bug, report and fail gracefully */
	if (WARN_ON(val == NULL))
		return -EFAULT;
..we surely want it to continue returning -EFAULT, regardless of
whether we log it, no? What use case did you have in mind?
