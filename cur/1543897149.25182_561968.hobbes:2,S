Please recall history of (for example) esound.
From esound README:
"Esound is an audio mixing server that allows multiple
applications to output sound to the same audio device."
It was started in time when most cheap sound cards was without hw mixer.
And .. when today you use ALSA on sound card without hw mixer still all 
this (past ?) problems are actual.
Look on main reasons developing arts ..
In documentation many other user space APIs you can find the same 
or similar reasons. Look .. I'm talkimg about real facts. Your 
disagreement completly ommits *reasons* spending some time on preapare 
this soud APIs.
ALSA still does not provides good soud devices virtualization for more 
then one application. Each day I'm using bludy words when I'm try to use 
skype which oppens /dev/mixer after run galeon with flash plugin which 
opens /dev/snd/pcm* or when I start GNOME session with soud enabled 
(handled by esd whuich uses ALSA).
