I am not the one that will pay you for that, as you can guess. :-)
I just was curious about the technical reasons, if any, of so large a
difference. Just, the CPU and the memory subsystem are certainly not the
issue. But I donnot want to prevent you from earning from such kind of
improvement. Hence, let me go back to free scsi.
