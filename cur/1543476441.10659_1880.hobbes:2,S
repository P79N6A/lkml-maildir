IMO, it is extremely desirable that Wine should *not* depend on the
underlying filesystem.  Therefore, if Wine really depends on this
behaviour, it would be desirable to fix Wine.  (I'm not sure that Wine
really requires this).
We also want Wine to work on other operating systems.
AFAIK, the only other program which uses access to the short names is
Samba.  (a) Why?  (b) Is there some other approach which Samba can use?
BTW, vfat is the only filesystem which will actually return the short
names to the application, through an ioctl().  ntfs, smbfs and iso9660
don't have such a mechanism, so can it really be that important?
