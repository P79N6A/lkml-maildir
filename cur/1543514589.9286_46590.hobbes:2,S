Yes. We've designed a log-structured flash FS for embedded linux (which
we'll probably release next month as GPL). It is quite simple and optimal
for small flashes with large sectors (normally the erase granularity for
flashes is big, so you can't use a normal filesystem). I'd expect it to
work for those cheaper sequential flashes as well, although I have never
built anything with that.
The GC is still under tuning. As it's a log-cleaner it can obviously run
pretty incremental, but the flash device's erase delay still sets the
minimum latency.
BTW log-structuring is a subset of journalling in my book (basically its
just a question of journalling metadata or data + metadata). So I guess it
wouldn't be wrong to use the term journalled filesystem for a
log-structured one, even though the latter better describes the system.
