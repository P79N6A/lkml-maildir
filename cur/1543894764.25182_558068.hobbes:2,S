Why is it too small?

Why is it soldered-ROM on rather than flash-ROM?

Why is it not open, and why does that get in the way of replacing the
software?

Why is it not released, and why does that get in the way of replacing
the software?

Why is the virtual ROM and the SHA1 key in the hardware?
Remember, the issue is intent.  If you do that for legitimate reasons,
such as technical limitations, industrial economic motives, etc,
you're probably fine.  But if you do that for the purpose of
restraining users' freedoms, then you're going against the intent (and
quite likely the letter) of the license.
