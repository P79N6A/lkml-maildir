Hi Nicolas
The addresses are the same for the i830mp and i845g so instead of
duplicating the code I just used the i830 setup functions for the 845g
as well.
Strictly speaking the comment that you referred to in your mail should
be changed to reflect i845g and not i830mp.
Thanks for your comments
Graeme Fisher
