Odd.  mempool with GFP_ATOMIC is basically equivalent to your
resource-pools, isn't it?: we'll try the slab allocator and if that failed,
fall back to the reserves.
It's missing the recharge-from-a-kernel-thread functionality but that can be
added easily enough if it's useful.  It's slightly abusive of the mempool
philosophy, but it's probably better to do that than to create a new and
very-similar thing.

If the only option is to panic then something's busted.  If it's network IO
then there should be a way of dropping the frame.  If it's disk IO then we
should report the failure and cause an IO error.
