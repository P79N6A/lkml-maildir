$ touch /dosc/longfilename           # longfilename -> longfi~1
$ touch /dosc/longfilename234        # longfliename234 -> longfi~2
$ rm /dosc/longfilename
$ yourbackup
$ rm /dosc/*
$ yourrestore                        # longfilename234 -> longfi~1
And you pick longfilename234 to generate the same encoding (it's not
actually 234). Silly, contrived, proves the point.

The whole point is that the proposed solutions are trying to make an
idiotic design into a sensible one.
It's not possible. VFAT is stupid. Let it fail. Trying to fix it can
only make Linux-VFAT idiotic as well.
Linux-VFAT makes the existing idiotic design look like UNIX. This is
as good as it needs to get. Do any VFAT backups in Windows.
My opinion only, etc. I just talk a lot, I don't write VFAT :-)
