It is. I'm running several pretty stable systems with IDE SW RAID 5
on top of Promise TX2/100 (~30 Eur) controllers. There was a long
standing limit of two cards from this type, which seems to be removed
lately (as Alan stated). At least, the test system hasn't fallen on 
it's face, when adding a third controller, and attached devices acted
as expected without freezing, throwing DMA errors, and the like.
Of course, the usual "don't buy the latest and greatest hardware, 
if the manufacturer isn't fully commited to linux support" applies.
Promise isn't!
Pete
