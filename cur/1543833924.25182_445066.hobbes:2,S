Foolishly, perhaps...

Feel free to suggest deleting said drivers.

I just won't work that way. Using that logic, Reiser 3 should be gone long
ago...

Right. But this way it is /not/ the kernel crowd's job to look after it.

Why should they? They don't feel confortable with the code, believe it has
fatal design (and other) problems. Its maintainers have shown a tendency to
disregard data safety, and just dump the code when something new fancies
them. The kernel hackers can't just take over any random piece of complex
code, the only scalable way of integrating new stuff that will stay for a
/long/ time is to have reasonable expectations that whoever proposes the
code will stay around maintaining it.

If it is in the kernel, the expectation is that it will stay in the kernel
for the foreseeable future. For a filesystem, something like the next 10
years. Thus letting in a new filesystem is a /huge/ commitment.
