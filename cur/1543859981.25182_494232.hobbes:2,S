Ah, what a pity:-) I mean, it is good, but it's exactly the same hardware 
I developed this port for and tested on. So, it should be easy. If you 
have any problems with your setup, look in linkstation / kurobox mailing 
list archives, I posted some instructions there for setting up a suitable 
u-boot version. Or just ask me. Or I could even just send you binaries to 
start with. Do you have JTag?...
Thanks
