Last year, I posted a patchset (that was meant for Preempt-RT at that
time) to be able to prioritise the interrupt-handler-threads (which
are kthreads) and softirq-threads from the kernel commandline. See
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/19/208
Maybe we can find a way to use a similar mechanism as I used in my
patchset for the priorities of the remaining kthreads.
I do not like the way of forcing userland to change the priorities,
because that would require a userland with the chrt tool installed,
and that is not that practical for embedded systems (in which there
could be cases that there is no userland at all, or the init-process
is the whole embedded application). In that case an option to do it on
the kernel commandline is more practical.
I propose this kernel cmd-line option:
kthread_pmap=somethread:50,otherthread:12,34
Then threads can be started as SCHED_NORMAL, and when overruled inside
the kthread-sources itself, or by the kernel commandline, the user can
set them to something else.
What do you think of this?
(notice that I am reworking the review comments I received on this
patch-series right now, and that I can take such change into account
immediately)
Kind Regards,
Remy
