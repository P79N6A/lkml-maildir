Reading again tcp_recvmsg(), I found it already is able to eat several skb
even in nonblocking mode.
setsockopt(5, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVLOWAT, [61440], 4) = 0

David, if you referred to code at line 1374 of net/ipv4/tcp.c, I believe there is
no issue with it. We really want to break from this loop if !timeo .
Willy patch makes splice() behaving like tcp_recvmsg(), but we might call
tcp_cleanup_rbuf() several times, with copied=1460 (for each frame processed)
I wonder if the right fix should be done in tcp_read_sock() : this is the
one who should eat several skbs IMHO, if we want optimal ACK generation.
We break out of its loop at line 1246
if (!desc->count) /* this test is always true */
	break;
(__tcp_splice_read() set count to 0, right before calling tcp_read_sock())
So code at line 1246 (tcp_read_sock()) seems wrong, or pessimistic at least.
