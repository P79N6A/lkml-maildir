Well, date and kernel version id, then.  Otherwise they may be
confusion if the translator is using 2.6.16.35 as opposed to
2.6.22-git3, etc.  I would hope that the translator would always be
using only the latest development branch, but I wouldn't want to
always bet on that.  One advantage of using git commit id is that
there's no question about what the source document version was for the
translation.  It also makes it easier for the translator since they
can just diff between the last git commit id, and HEAD, and then
update their translation accordingly.
