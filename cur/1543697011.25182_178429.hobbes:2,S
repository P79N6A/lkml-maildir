Hi there,
Stewart Smith told me that this is where I report strange Linux Kernel bugs.
I'm running make menuconfig on 2.6.0-test9
I've come across a strange cosmetic bug under:
Device Drivers->Graphics Support
If you select "Matrox Acceleration" either built in or as module there 
are two options:
- G100/G200/G400/G450/G500 support
and
- G100/G200/G400 support
If you select the first, the second disappears.
If you select the second, the first stays.
I have a G400, so this is a bit confusing.
Hope this helps somebody.  :-)
Keep up the good work.
Cheers,
Tudor.
