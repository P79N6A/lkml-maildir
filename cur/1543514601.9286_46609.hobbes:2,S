Machine is running ok with 1 cpu, but i like to use the second one.
I read that 2.2.13 has some bugfixes for ide +raid
Is the bug fixed ?
And :
raid 0.9 is in Ac1 and Ac2 patch , so i should patch it with this one, but
what about ide (promise udma66) support ? 
i only see a 2.2.12 and 2.2.13pe17 kernel patch, so which one should i use
?
(or is there a 2.2.13final patch?)
