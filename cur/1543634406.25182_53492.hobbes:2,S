Obviously, in my case, if I had known about the problems it would have
later, I wouldn't have bought it.  But at the time, 2 433 Celerons were
cheaper than a Pentium III 600 system.
At least, with the additional fan I've added, and the "noapic" option, it is
pretty reliable.  Up for weeks at a time before I reboot.  Of course, when I
had my IBM hard drives on the HT366 board, it was more likely to crash from
a DMA error than the apic problems.
In fact, the last problems I had were SCSI related, fixed by adding a second
SCSI card for some external devices.  Not motherboard related.

Unfortunately not.  I got a nice PSU when I ordered the BP6,
thinking that power was the only issue. (It was the only
cheap dual solution at the time.)
