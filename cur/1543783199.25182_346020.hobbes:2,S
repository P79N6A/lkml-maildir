Wouldn't it make more sense for the endtime to be returned in the same 
format (relative/absolute) as the original timer was specified?  That 
way an application can set a new timer for "timeout + SLEEPTIME" and on 
average it will be reasonably accurate.
In the proposed method, for endtime to be useful the app needs to check 
the current time, compare with the endtime, and figure out the delta. 
If you're going to force the app to do all that work anyway, the app may 
as well use absolute times.
