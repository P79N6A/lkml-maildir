Then I apologize.
Please allow me to demonstrate with code, which should be clearer.
Name: Fix sysfs Node Cpumap for Large NR_CPUS
Status: Booted on 2.6.7-rc2-bk3
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
As pointed out by Paul Jackson, sometimes 99 chars is not enough.  We
currently get a page from sysfs: that code should check we don't
haven't overrun it, and for futureproofing, detect problem at
buildtime.
