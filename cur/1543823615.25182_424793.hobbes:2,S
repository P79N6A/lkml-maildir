You'll need OpenGL/GLX and SDL too to stand a chance.
And in any case, porting gtk+ includes porting gdk, and gdk isn't much
more than a very thin layer over libX11 with some added functionality.
So in practice it is a better idea to have a libX11-compatible API
(and if possible ABI), which will give you gdk/gtk/Qt/Motif for "free"
(not GL/SDL though), and then change gtk/Qt where appropriate to use
your own features.
