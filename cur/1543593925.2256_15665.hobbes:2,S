Why not call MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT?  It makes it much
more obvious you are closing a race related to modules, and it goes away
when the module is built into the kernel.
(as a tangent, I have run into cases where it would be nice to always
have a module ref count, whether or not you were built into the kernel. 
this would be ok with me...)
