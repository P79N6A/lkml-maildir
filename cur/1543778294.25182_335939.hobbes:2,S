If I understand correctly it tries to workaround some netlink
limitations (limited number of netlink families and multicast groups)
by sending everything to userspace and demultiplexing it there.
Same in the other direction, an additional layer on top of netlink
does basically the same thing netlink already does. This looks like
a step in the wrong direction to me, netlink should instead be fixed
to support what is needed.
