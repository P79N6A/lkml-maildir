The problem with this is that PG_private is used only for the SLOB
part of the allocator and not the bigblock part.
We _could_ just bite the bullet and have SLOB set PG_slab, however
that would encouarage more users of this flag which we should hope
to get rid of one day.
The real problem is that nommu wants to get the size of either
kmalloc or alloc_pages objects and it needs to differentiate
between them. So I would rather nommu to take its own page flag
(could overload PG_swapcache, perhaps?), and set that flag on
pages it allocates directly, then uses that to determine whether
to call ksize or not.
