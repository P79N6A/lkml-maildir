As a data point, running 2.4.5-ac1 on a Thinkpad with 512M ram and 1G
swap partition, I used the imagemagick programs to manipulate a couple
of dozen large images that would create intermediate images a little
over 1G in size.
This would totally freeze the system for interactive use.  Left alone,
the system was stable, nothing was killed by the system, and
everything recovered fine, however once the swap started, nothing else
could be initiated or even monitored.  Even the xclock would freeze
solid for several minutes during the program run.  Running the same
thing under 'nice' seemed to make no difference.
Running X, xemacs, etc. in my standard configuraton, top looks at the
moment like (using -ac5 now) during 'idle':
 00:17:13 up 52 min,  6 users,  load average: 2.00, 2.06, 1.98
