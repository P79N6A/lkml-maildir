The funny thing is, there are about 3 different versions of 
smp_call_function and removing nonatomic would reduce the argument count 
(there are some architectures which use 'retry' in nonatomic's place) and 
i'm a bit wary of making other archs bend over for i386 these days. 
Perhaps renaming it to __unused or something similarly obvious.
