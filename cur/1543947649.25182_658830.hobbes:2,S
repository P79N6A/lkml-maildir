Well. That's 99% of all bugreports I receive. You will understand
that I won't explain the same crap that's written on linuxwireless.org
over and over 20 times each day to random people.
And yes, you belong to the group of my "random people", as I don't
remember your name from the top of my head.
So in 99% of the cases the user did something wrong.
But I still don't see the insult.

That is not true. It doesn't work with exactly _one_ revision
of the bcm4311 card. And that is already fixed in 2.6.25.
I'd like to have that in .24-stable, too, but I guess it's too big.
It changes some parts of the DMA engine code.

Yeah. But I don't like that patch. Then people came and said stuff like
I _have_ to accept it because it fixes stuff I broke. Excuse me, but
nobody can force me to sign off a patch that I am not completely
convinced of. _Even_ if it turns out that a commit made by me
broke something. Especially, if there's already another fix for the
situation queued up in the development kernel.

Yeah. Experience shows that. Read the archives.

So be it. And you guess what? We already sent a fix for those
people upstream a long time ago. It is in 2.6.25.

Did you _ever_ even try it?
