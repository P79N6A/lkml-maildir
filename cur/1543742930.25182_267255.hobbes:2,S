Damn, you are right - this is a new driver...
I didn't notice that, i did rely on hotplug to load the correct modules.
Removed the ub driver and everything is fine now.
That means - just unloadin ub and loading usb-storage didn't work. 
I had to remove it from the kernel config and rebuild the modules. Actually 
usb-storage was the only module being rebuilt. Looks like usb-storage's 
functionality is different if ub is built.
So, my system works fine again, thank you.
But it leaves the question: why does ub perform so badly?
And: could maybe somebody put some hints into the ub help?
"This driver supports certain USB attached storage devices such as flash 
keys." didn't sound so bad to me...
Worf
