Guys,
I need some guidance. The issue can be resolved in several ways but I am not
sure which one is better:
- just revert the patch and continue doing everything in IRQ context;
- move IRQ/tasklet split higher, into atkbd and psmouse-base respectively.
  Every device would have it's own ring buffer, tasklet will be fired off
  for incoming data only (i.e. ACKs and command response will be processed
  right there in IRQ context);
- move drivers/char/keyboard.c from tasklet to schedule_work. Need also
  take care of others who are using keyboard_tasklet (qtronix, scan_keyb,
  ec3104_keyb);
- have atkbd use schedule_work to do LED and repeat rate setting.
What would you suggest?
