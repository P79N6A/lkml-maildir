There is no guarantee that a partial slab is available.

I wonder if this makes any sense at all given that the only point of 
what you are doing is to help to decide which alloc should fail...

The memory policy constraints may have been setup to cage in an 
application. It was setup to *stop* the application from using memory on 
other nodes. If you now allow that then the semantics of memory policies
are significantly changed. The cpuset constraints are sometimes not that 
hard but I better let Paul speak for them.

GFP_THISNODE can have a similar effect.

No I said that in an interrupt allocation we have no process context and 
therefore no cpuset or memory policy context. Thus no policies or cpusets
are applied to an allocation. You can allocate without restrictions.
