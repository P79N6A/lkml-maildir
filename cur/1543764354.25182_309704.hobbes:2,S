OK, Linus, I find it amazing that you
like all my patches, even though I myself
think they are wrong:)
I still have those two questions however:
1. Does the "later sti" fixes the problem
also in case of an NMI? I mean, why can't
you just be NMI'ed before you did sti?
NMI uses the restore_all too IIRC.
2. How can one be sure there are no more
of the like places where the stack is left
empty?
