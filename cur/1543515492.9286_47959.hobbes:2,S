You can never copy to user under a spin-lock. The user's page(s) might
not be present and you need to page-fault which can't happen under the
spin-lock.
Instead, if you are copying something that can change, so you need a
spin-lock, do:
	spin_lock_irqsave(&lock_flag, flags);
	memcpy(tmp_buf, volatile_buf, len);
	spin_unlock(&lock_flag, flags);
        copy_to_user(user_buf, tmp_buf, len);
Stuff that can't possibly change during the operation, requires no
spin-locks at all. In your code snippet retained above, everything is
a constant. It needs no lock.
