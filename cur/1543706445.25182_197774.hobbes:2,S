That seems very odd, the "umount /tmp/a" should have failed, given than 
nothing is mounted there any longer.
Also, what will happen if something on the filesystem on /tmp/a is open 
(say, /dev/console)? I was thinking that this process might work better:
$ mkdir /tmp/a /tmp/b
$ mount -t ramfs test /tmp/a
$ touch /tmp/a/foo
$ mount --bind /tmp/a /tmp/b
$ ls /tmp/b
foo
$ umount /tmp/a
$ ls /tmp/b
foo
And it does. In fact, it seems to work fine as long as no files are open 
on the ramfs when the umount is executed (otherwise -EBUSY).
