But there is another paragraph that mentions that an OS may use lazy tlb
shootdowns.
[search for shootdown]
You check the far too obvious chapters, remember that Intel wrote the
documentation ;-)
I searched for 'dirty' though Vol 3 and found
Chapter 7.1.2.1 Automatic locking.
.. the processor uses locked cycles to set the accessed and dirty flag
in the page-directory and page-table entries.
But that obviously doesn't answer your question.
Is the sequence
<< lock;
read pte
pte |= dirty
write pte
>> end lock;
or
<< lock;
read pte
if (!present(pte))
	do_page_fault();
pte |= dirty
write pte.
>> end lock;
