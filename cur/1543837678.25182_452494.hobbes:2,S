I _want_ to agree with Erik, but I must agree:  CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is 
pretty worthless in practice :(  It's not maintained rigorously, and 
distros _always_ enable it, because otherwise they would often omit key 
drivers that people actively use.
So, while my own personal preference would be to follow Erik's 
suggestion...  thinking realistically, an fstype change from "ext3dev" 
to "ext4" is a far more obvious-to-users method of creating a 
devel/production line of demarcation.
