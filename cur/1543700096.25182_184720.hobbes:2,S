The dumps show that the server misses frames and/or sees generous amount
of garbage during UDP transfer. Which transfer rate can you achieve for big
writes between 8129 ?
Can you:
- retrieve the ifconfig output on the client/server just before and after the
  write (8192 sized NFS from 8169 to 8139) ?
- send a dump of a 8192 bytes sized 1Mo write from 8139 to 8139 ?
