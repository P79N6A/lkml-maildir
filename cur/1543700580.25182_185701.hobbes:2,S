Today utilization of execution resources of a logical processor is
around 60% as you can find in public papers, and it's dependent on the
processor implementation and the workload. It could be higher in the
future, and their relative priority could be much higher then. So I
don't think it's a good idea to hard code such a implementation-specific
factor into the generic scheduler code.
Regarding H/W-based priority, I'm not sure it's very useful especially
because so many events happen inside the processor and a set of the
execution resources required changes very rapidly at runtime, i.e. the
H/W knows what it should do to run faster at runtime, and imposing
priority on those logical processor could make them run slower.
I think a software priority-based solution like the below would be more
generic and work better.
