Include the ataraid driver for striping on the Promise Fasttrak 100. If
you want to use their own driver boot with ide[n]=off

Linux found the OSB5 but found the BIOS had left colliding PCI
resources. At that point it let that deivce fall back to the generic PIO
legacy IDE driver instead. 2.4.19-ac1 handles this BIOS problem on the
i845 chipset boards, it ought to handle it on the non i845 ones

I/O ports unassigned. Spank your vendor.
I am curious why the -ac PCI fixups didn't resolve this problem. Out of
interest edit pci-i386.c and remove the IDE test in
pcibios_assign_resources.
