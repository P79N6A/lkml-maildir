All the stuff that was waiting for Linus has been sent.  Here's what's 
sitting around in the netdev-2.6 to "stew" for a bit:
* wireless-2.6 tree (bk://gkernel.bkbits.net/wireless-2.6)
* 8139cp updates
* starfire update
* 8139too iomap conversion
* natsemi long/short cable option (no longer needed?)
* new skge driver from Stephen Hemminger
BK URL, Patch URL, and changelog attached.
Note that the patch is diff'd against 2.6.11-bk6, which will not exist 
until four hours after this email is sent.
