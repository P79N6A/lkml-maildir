A linux 2.0.34 srever was physically moved whilst I mounted
/Development/bridgett/coke from it.
bash now hangs when I do tab-completion on /Development/bridgett - it's in D
state according to ps.
dmesg says:
nfs: server cocaine not responding, still trying
nfs: task 41700 can't get a request slot

kernel is 2.2.0-final
NB: yesterday I sighup'd the mount.d daemon but not nfsd on the 2.0.34
server. When I tried to mount it I got these in dmesg (the directory was
exported rw,root_squash):
nfs_read_super: get root fattr failed
