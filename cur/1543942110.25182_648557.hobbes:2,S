Syncookies are discouraged these days. They disable too many 
valuable TCP features (window scaling, SACK) and even without them 
the kernel is usually strong enough to defend against syn floods
and systems have much more memory than they used to be.
So I don't think it makes much sense to add more code to it, sorry.
Besides you should really move it to the ipv6 module, right now the code
would be always compiled in even for ipv4 only kernels.
