You might want to consider losing that stuff when sending patches - it just

The patch is terribly wordwrapped.
I suspect a lot of the code which you're fixing is about to be removed. 
But I suppose we should fix it before removing it anwyay.  Still, please
split this patch into at least one for sound/oss and one for sound/soc and
sound/pci, thanks.
