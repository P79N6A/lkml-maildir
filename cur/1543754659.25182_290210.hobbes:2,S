	No this is not correct. ACPI processor.ko driver which supports
physical CPU hotplug needs register_cpu() and unregister_cpu() functions
for dynamically hotadd/hotremove support of the processors.
Please see drivers/acpi/processor_core.c  
	acpi_processor_hotadd_init() -> arch_register_cpu() ->
		->register_cpu().
