First that would allow an attacker to guess the state of the entropy pool
(letting him predict future /dev/urandom output yuck, cracking your session
keys). Normal /dev/random uses an hash to prevent exactly that.
And you need 2 bytes (16bit) per packet. For fast or gigabit ethernet you
would need several hundred KB of entropy per minute. Where you get that much
entropy from? 
/dev/u?random is really only good for seeding fast RNDs, not replacing them.
