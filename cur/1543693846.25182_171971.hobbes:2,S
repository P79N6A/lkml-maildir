I'm blind. The esp value is the culprit:
It's not 32-bit aligned. Someone misaligned the stack, and thus
    if(stack_ptr & (THREAD_SIZE-1))
didn't notice the end of the stack.
The generated assembly of store_slabinfo is correct:
     1d2:       f7 c6 ff 1f 00 00       test   $0x1fff,%esi
Check sptr against THREAD_SIZE -1
     1d8:       74 21                   je     1fb <store_stackinfo+0x6f>
     1da:       8b 3e                   mov    (%esi),%edi
And load *sptr.

Wrong direction:  Right now it crashes because it runs over the end of 
the stack.
With your patch applied, the allocated object is too small to hold all 
entries on the stack, and thus store_stackinfo aborts before it runs 
into the next page.
I'd increase kstack_depth_to_print to 140. Do not increase it too much, 
otherwise it will oops due to the misaligned stack.
Then check the EBP values: They are pushed after the return address. The 
return addresses are listed in the Call Trace section.
Example:
0xc01316aa8 pushes 0xc0349dd6 -> odd.
0xc0131b6c pushes 0xc0349de6 -> odd.
0xc0131b3e pushes c0349e02 -> odd.
Proper values for EBP are multiples of 4. One you find where the stack got misaligned, disassemble the offending function (or send me the .o file)
