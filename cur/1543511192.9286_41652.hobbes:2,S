Missed that, I skipped straight to the code :)
I think there is still room for improvement.  '-march=k6' should be a
win on all K6's.  Also, CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW is new and not necessarily
mature.
For those reasons I think that CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW should be an option,
not a feature auto-selected by config.in.  That will allow users to
choose whether or not they want to use the new MMX routines.
if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
	if [ "$CONFIG_MK6" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_MK7" = "y" ]; then
		bool '3Dnow/MMX support routines' CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
	fi
fi
Take this with a grain of salt, Alan ignored a similar patchlet from me.

This looked to me like the semantic equivalent of '#if 0'.  I would not
remove "_AND_WORKS" without heavy testing on both K6 and K7.

Until Linus gets back from vacation, Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com> is
temporarily Head Penguin.
