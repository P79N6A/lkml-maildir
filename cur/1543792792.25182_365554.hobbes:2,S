hm.   I thought we were going to address this by
a) checking for an insane number of mappings of the same page in the
   pagefault handler(s) and 
b) special-casing ZERO_PAGEs on the page unallocator path.
That'll generate faster and smaller code than adding an extra shift and
possibly larger constants in lots of places.
It's cleaner, too.
