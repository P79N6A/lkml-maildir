Subject: Creating virtual interface triggers an IGMPv3 Join to Multicast DNS

Hi folks,
For some reason, every time I create a virtual interface (using tun),
the interface immediately generates an IGMPv3 Join packet for group
224.0.0.251, which (according to Google) is Multicast DNS.
This packet is generated automatically and consistently. I'm wondering
why this should be the case, and if it can be disabled.
Thanks,
Adam
