alignof(uint64_t) is 8 on just about every 32-bit architecture except
i386. Using __attribute__((packed)) for the 32-on-64 compat code is thus
wrong on every 64-bit architecture except x86_64 and ia64.
It's the _location_ which is wrong; the handling of unaligned loads is
irrelevant (and Linux actually supports a bunch of architecture on which
fixups are impossible now, btw).
