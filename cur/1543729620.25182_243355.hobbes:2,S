Hi all,
This is not really a kernel issue, apologize if anyone thinks that this 
is not the right place to post it. But I am writing a kernel module and 
got stuck on fwrite, really hope someone could point out what stupid 
mistake I've made. I wrote a very simple code to test the idea, what I 
really want to do in fred() is to read from 'dest' and write to 'src'. 
It seems that upon running , fgetc doesn't get anything from in_stream, 
so the first char it gets is an EOF and it breaks. Just why fwrite 
didn't write anything to in_stream?
If this is not the right way to do it, what is ?
Appreciate any comments, even harsh ones.
TIA
Lei
// in test.c
#include <stdio.h>
fred(char *dest, size_t *destlen, char *src, size_t size)
{
     FILE *in_stream = tmpfile();
     FILE *out_stream = tmpfile();
     fwrite(src, 1, size, in_stream);
     int c, i;
     for(i = 0;;i++)
     {
   	c = fgetc(in_stream);
   	fprintf(stderr, "get char %c\n", c);
	if ( c == EOF) break;
   	fputc(c, out_stream);
      }
     *destlen = i;
	
     fseek(out_stream, 0, SEEK_SET); //rewind
     fread(dest, 1, *destlen, out_stream);
     fclose(in_stream);
     fclose(out_stream);
     fprintf(stderr, "buf = `%s', size = %d\n", dest, *destlen);
}
int main(void)
{
   static char source[] = "really hope this works ";
   char *bp = malloc (2048);
   size_t destlen;
   fred(bp, &destlen, source, strlen(source));
   fprintf(stderr, "buf = `%s', size = %d\n", bp, destlen);
   return 0;
}
