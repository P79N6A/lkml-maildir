I thought (intel) CPUs did 48-bit addressing? How do we support 32GiB of 
RAM? With pure 32-bit addressing it would be limited to 4GiB only... No? 
(Of course I am probably confusing varius types of addresses...)

The code is still broken. The values ARE 64-bit (check the struct 
definitions if you don't believe me). This is just a matter of correctness. 
It is incorrect as it is right now and it will do Bad Things(tm) if the 
supplied values are > 32-bit. (Whether it is possible for a malicious user 
to supply them is beyond my knowledge.)
Best regards,
