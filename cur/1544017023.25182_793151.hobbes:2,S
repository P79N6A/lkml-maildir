	My feeling is this should be a signal subsystem rather than a NOOP
subsystem. Then, if users want the grouping for something besides
signaling, it doesn't matter if they don't issue any signals via the
signal.send file. Also, I think Paul's suggestion would be just as
useful for a signal subsystem.
	What do you think?
