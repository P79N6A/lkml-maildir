Here's my feedback, then ;-)
Your patch would be ok IMHO if you additionally changed the arches to
include task struct inside struct thread_info, getting things back down
to a single allocation for thread_info+task_struct, with 'current' once
again being a constant offset from the beginning of thread_info.  [this
might require resurrecting the old patches to move task struct
definitions out of sched.h proper]
Basically, I think you are going in the right direction, but the
implementation detail of flat out copying code was what caught my
attention, and looks pretty bad to me.  Two easy ways I can think of for
providing generic code would be #include <asm-generic/foo.h>, or
enabling generic code when feature macro HAVE_ARCH_FOO is not defined.

Seems a sane enough direction...
