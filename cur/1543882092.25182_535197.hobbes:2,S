oh man, every patch I review, every bug I fix, I dream of this.
Wishlist:
- wire it up to a robot which monitors all Linux mailing lists and sends
  machine-review comments back to originators.  This will be a huge win by
  eliminating so much stupid crap.  
- auto-detect wordwrapped and tab-replaced emails (oh glory)
- auto-detect code wider than 80-cols (swoon)
- auto-detect missing Signed-off-by:
- auto-check patch format and protocol, as per
  
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
 and
  
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
- teach it about semantics:
  - kthread instead of kernel_thread
  - mutexes instead of semaphores
  - the whole plethora of whitespace uckfuppednesses
  - needlessly-initialised-to-zero-static-variables
  - extern-decls-in-C
  - EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo) is placed immediately after foo()'s closing
    brace
    Hard to do?  Could just whine about all EXPORT_SYMBOL's which
    aren't immediately preceded by ^}$ or by ;$
  - new typedefs
  - use of uint32_t and friends
  - use of BUG_ON and BUG, frankly.  The thing's a damn pest.  Suggest
    WARN_ON+recover-from-it.
  - use of `if ((var = expr()))' and similar
  - large inlined functions?
  - braces around single statements (advanced topic ;))
  - StudlyCaps?
  - anything called "tmp" or "temp"
  - old-style struct initialisers
  - non-ascii characters(?)
  - lots more to come, I'm sure.
