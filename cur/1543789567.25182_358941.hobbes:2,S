I disagree.
Without having looked deeper at the details of this specific patch, it's 
generally a good cleanup to move function declarations to header files.
This avoids the nasty class of runtime errors we sometimes get when 
someone changes the prototype of a function but forgets to update all 
the prototypes floating around in .c files.
