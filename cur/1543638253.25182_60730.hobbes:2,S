Ok, thanks. I'll try to revert some patches from -rc4. But it looks
more like a side effect IMHO. Perhaps the APM initialization code
triggers one of the numerous bugs in the bios :-/
If I enable APM in the bios, the crash is somewhat different. I get
about two pages of call traces looping back every 8 pointers.
Seems like a memory corruption to me...
2.4.19-rc3-ac5 is OK, BTW.
Cheers,
Willy
