	As I recall, devfsd will create symlinks, not actual files, this doesn't
do what we want.  Unless devfsd creates files that have major,minor attributes,
and if it does that, what use is there for devfs, or at least, for having devfs
mounted?  Then of course, there is still the whole problem w/ running out of
major,minor numbers...
