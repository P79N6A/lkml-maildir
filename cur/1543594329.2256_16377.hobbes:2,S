I have been trying to enable Netfilters to mark ip packets, (i.e. using
iptables and iproute2).  My problem is that after upgrading from 2.2.4
kernel to a 2.4 version, I did the following:
make menuconfig - enabling the appropriate options
make dep
make bzImage
make bzlilo
The problem is I cannot get iptables or ipoute2 working.  I can see header
files for iptables, but nothing eslse, and I cannot find any reference to
iproute2 whatsoever.
Can anyone mail me as to what I may be doing wrong?  I am a relative
newcomer to linux.
Cheers.
