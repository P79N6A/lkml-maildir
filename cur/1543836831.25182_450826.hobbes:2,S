It's normally policy to only care about in tree code regarding exports and hooks.
But also no policy without exceptions.

Christopher L. complained about it taking too long on IA64 I think
(but that might have been some IA64 specific quirk)
I think I proposed to use a inline check of the chain and only then
call the external function, but that might not have been implemented
that way.
