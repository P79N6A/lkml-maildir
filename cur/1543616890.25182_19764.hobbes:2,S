Yes, but I did latency testing for Robert for several months, now.

I am, too. But more for 3D visualization/simulation (with audio).

Not for me. Even when lock-brake is applied.

Q3A is _NOT_ changed in any case. Even some smoother system "feeling" with 
Q3A and UT 436 running in parallel on an UP 1 GHz Athlon II, 640 MB. Have you 
seen something on any Win box?

You told me that TUX show some problems with preempt before.
What problems? Are they TUX specific?
Some latency numbers coming soon.
