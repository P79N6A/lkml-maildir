Adding an epoll fd inside another epoll fd is perfectly legal. It would
kinda suck if epoll itself wouldn't expose a pollable interface too.

Yes, that is not what programs normally do. Most of the times you have 
nesting level equal zero, although we've seen recently that the 
epoll-being-pollable feature (hence nesting) is used too. Say you have two 
(or more) libraries, each own monitoring different things, and each own 
with its own wait+dispatch loop. If these libraries didn't have a chance 
to expose a pollable fd, you'd have to run their wait+dispatch loop in 
seaprate threads. Whereas epoll being itself pollable allows you to:
	epoll_wait(lib1_fd, lib2_fd)
	if (ready(lib1_fd))
		lib1_dispatch()
	if (ready(lib2_fd))
		lib2_dispatch()
This is pretty powerful, although needs care for wakeups and poll nested 
calls.
