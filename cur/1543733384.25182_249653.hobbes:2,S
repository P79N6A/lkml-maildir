IIRC no deliberate /proc/sys/vm/swappiness semantic changes were merged.
The policy tweakers have something to answer for here unless some stats
they rely upon have since been flubbed. Logging periodic snapshots of
/proc/vmstat for these benchmarks may be helpful to implicate specific
statistics' bungling or rule out statistic miscalculation as causes.
