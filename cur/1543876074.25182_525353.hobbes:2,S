That's not a good comparison: you're comparing two different machines of two
different archs.

The thing to do is to pass a flag to mmap() to suppress the memset (as
suggested).  This can then be used by the uClibc malloc() implementation and
does not impact any application that does an anon mmap() expecting the memory
returned to be zeroed.
