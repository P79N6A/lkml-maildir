To pass argument it is not a problem we do it like we
passed the rules in the rules_list(see the function
exec_rule in auto_conf.c ). The lex parser has to be
expanded in that way that it gives everything written
after "auto" to the autoconfig.
 config FOO
 	bool "foo"
 	auto "detect-foo-script" 
So the new programm will work like that:
It goes through are the Kconfig as usual. For any
Option that doesn't have any "auto" a '\n' will be
given. If there is an "auto" it will execute the
script that is written after it. I think it might work
like that. Any suggestion??

If the script want to ask some question, what will be
the difference if we write make config.
