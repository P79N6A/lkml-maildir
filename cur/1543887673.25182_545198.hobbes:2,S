That tells prepare_write() that the region to be modified is the whole page -
which is incorrect.  We're going to change a little bit of it.
Hmmm... Thinking about it again, I probably shouldn't be using
afs_prepare_write() at all.  afs_prepare_write() does two things:
 (1) Fills in the bits around the edges of the region to be modified if the
     page is not up to date.
 (2) Records the region of the page to be modified.
If afs_prepare_write() function is invoked by write(), then the region in (2)
is known, and thus the edges are known.
But if it's called from page_mkwrite(), we don't know where the edges are, so
we have to refresh the entire page if it's not up to date, and then we have to
record that the entire page needs writing back as we don't know which bits
have changed.

That assumes nopage() will be called in all cases - which it won't.

I still want to put a comment in my code to say *why* I'm doing this.

That's inconsistent with other core code, truncate_complete_page() for
example.

The comment stays, though I'm willing to improve it.
