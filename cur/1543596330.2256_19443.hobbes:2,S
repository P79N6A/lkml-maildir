Every time dev_get_by_name is called, and it has returned a valid struct net_device*, dev_put should be called afterwards, because otherwise the machine hangs when the device is unregistered (since dev->refcnt > 1). However, it seems that some drivers do
not call dev_put after dev_get_by_name: for example, drivers/net/pppoe.c at line 573 and net/core/dv.c at line 168. Am I wrong?
