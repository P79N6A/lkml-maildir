    Technical true, but changing it DOES affect userland:  there is still
    code which assumes things about the size of major/minor numbers.
You don't understand.
kdev_t is a data type, something like int or struct inode *.
This data type holds certain data, or points at certain data.
Just for the kernel's internal pleasure.
There are *no* kernel interfaces, not really, that show a
kdev_t to userspace. So it is impossible that userland
is affected.
Major and minor numbers are not involved at all.
And if they are, then only the kernel-internal major and minor
numbers, which are rather unrelated to those used in userland.
    Look at the assignment of ROOT_DEV in the various architectures.
OK, I look.
	ROOT_DEV = MKDEV(FLOPPY_MAJOR, 0);
	ROOT_DEV = MKDEV(RAMDISK_MAJOR, 0);
	ROOT_DEV = to_kdev_t(0x0802);
Where is userland? This is kernel code.

    Making kdev_t a structure is obviously the eventual, and best solution. 
    But I disagree that making it a pointer is the easiest thing to do, or
    that another large array is the way to go.  By keeping kdev_t an lvalue
But a pointer to a structure *is* an lvalue.
    you make it easier to update current code which doesn't use kdev_t.h
    macros, or is in some other way "hairy".
    Or to put it another way, keeping kdev_t an lvalue is the quickest
    method to get me to the end result of larger major/minor numbers.
But a pointer to a structure *is* an lvalue.
