Even if we were going to merge this functionality as-is, I'd ask for some
sort of refactoring to fix up that ifdef maze.
But more substantial issues:
- This is presented as a "debug" feature, but it isn't a debug feature at
  all - it is new functionality which is unrelated to kernel development.
  Also, it is a "debug" feature which provides no debugging!  At the very
  least, one would expect to see it emit a printk to tell people that we
  have some driver which needs fixing.
  Also, this not-really-a-debug-feature is undesirably coupled with a
  real debugging feature: CONFIG_DEBUG_PENDING_IRQ.
- Does this new feature really need its own Kconfig setting?  Why not enable
  it unconditionally?  request_irq() isn't exactly performance-critical.
- If poss, we really do want to find some way of emitting a warning when
  we detect such a device driver.  Like, call the handler and if it
  returned IRQ_HANDLED, start shouting.
