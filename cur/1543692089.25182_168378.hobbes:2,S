There are always alternatives...
If really this is a problem, how about slabifying the structs
nfs_fattr and/or nfs_fh?
Also, since nfs_entry is only large due to the fh and fattr fields
which are unused unless you have READDIRPLUS (in which case they are
converted to pointers anyhow), how about kicking them out of
nfs_entry altogether?
Cheers,
