Same problem on i370.  No atomic exchange, not even atomic inc, it all
has to be done using compare and swap and loop until successful.  Most
of the time the update works first time and no loop is taken.  IMHO, we
have to accept this overhead to simulate xchg instructions on machines
that do not have the instruction.
i370 equivalent of "xchg word,newvalue".
      L     R2,newvalue  New value to register
loop  L     R1,word      Current value to register
      CS    R1,R2,word   Store new value if word is unchanged
      BNE   loop         It changed, retry with new current value
