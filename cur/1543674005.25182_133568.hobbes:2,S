   true.  however, i think i would like to do both at once.  but it seems 
   like just replacing atm_dev_lock with rtnl would probably be enough
   for right now.
You still need to have a spinlock to guard the actual insert/delete
from the list so that readers don't see inconsistent data.
Really, look at how netdevices are managed, searched, etc.

   are you referring to the other bits of linux-atm like br2684, lane,
   mpoa, pppoatm or something else?
The whole ATM stack needs to be doing sane things in this area, yes.
