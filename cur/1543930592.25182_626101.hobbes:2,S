+Rename is a complex beast. The following table shows which rename(2) operations
+should succeed and which should fail.
+
+o: success
+E: error (either unionfs or vfs)
+X: EXDEV
+
+none = file does not exist
+file = file is a file
+dir  = file is a empty directory
+child= file is a non-empty directory
+wh   = file is a directory containing only whiteouts; this makes it logically
+		empty
+
+                      none    file    dir     child   wh
+file                  o       o       E       E       E
+dir                   o       E       o       E       o
+child                 X       E       X       E       X
+wh                    o       E       o       E       o

+Renaming directories:
+=====================
+
+Whenever a empty (either physically or logically) directory is being renamed,
+the following sequence of events should take place:
+
+1) Remove whiteouts from both source and destination directory
+2) Rename source to destination
+3) Make destination opaque to prevent anything under it from showing up
