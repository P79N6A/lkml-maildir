Yes, but with the added benefit of not having to use it.
In the case of mp3 playback, it's much better to do the buffering
on the input side to the decompressor, not at the output side,
as you can do 10 times the buffering with the same amount of memory.
Also, my modem stuff _definitely_ doesn't want any additional buffering
layer, and certainly not in the kernel.
