Nobody said the data should come from the LL-HL layer, it can come
from the isdn-tty driver itself when it detects read access on an
disconnect/not-yet-connected line. Only when the line is in connected
state the reads will pass data from the LL-HL layers.
I however won't like to see this, it all sounds suspusiously to userland
solutions. The ioctls command/status operations are neat, polling for AT
stuff is a capital offence :)
If I make another suggestion, what about a nice ioctl for access to the
control bus on ISDN?
