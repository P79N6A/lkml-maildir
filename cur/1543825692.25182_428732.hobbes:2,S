I see the panic_notifier_list but I am afraid that we can not afford
to send the crash/panic notifications if system admin has chosen to load
the kdump kernel and has decided to take a dump in case of a crash event.
This might very seriously compromise the reliability of kdump. IIRC, we
recently saw an issue with powerpc where we did not even start booting into
the second kernel as system lost way somewhere while handling notifiers.
So far on a panic event kernel only used to display the panic string
and halt the system but now it tries to do much more. That is boot
into the second kernel and caputure the dump. Of course, one can argue
that I want to implement a different policy in case of system crash. In
that case probably we should not load the kdump kernel at all.
panic_notifier_list helps in this regard that multiple subsystem can
register their own policy and policy will be excuted in the registered
priority order. Given the nature of kdump, I feel it is kind of 
mutually exclusive and can not co-exist with other policies. Otherwise, we 
will end up calling all other policies first and trigger booting into
the second kernel last. This is equivalent to giving higher priority to
all other policies and least priority to kdump.

I am no failover expert, but a quick thought suggests me that doing
anything after the panic is not reliable. So should't all failover
mechanisms depend on auto detecting that failure has occurred instead
of failing system informing that I am about to fail so you better take
over. Something like syncying two systems with a hearbeat message kind
of thing and if main node fails, it will stop generating hearbeat
messages and spare node will take over.
