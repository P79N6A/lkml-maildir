Hi folks,
I`d like to figure out how to change the masquerading behavior for
connections
that are idle for a period of time. The scenario: I access an
IMAP-Mailserver from
behind a firewall. While I read my mail, the connection should remain
open. If
it is idle for a couple of minutes, the masquerading gateway seems to
close the
connection so that the mail client needs to reconnect. Is there a way to
modify
this behavior so that the connection remains open?
Thank you.
Bye,
 Levent.
