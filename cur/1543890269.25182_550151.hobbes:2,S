Did you forget to provide a termios2 structure for ARM?  Hope you
remembered for the other arches:
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c: In function `set_termios':
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:429: error: invalid application of `sizeof' to incomplete type `termios2'
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c: In function `n_tty_ioctl':
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:732: error: invalid application of `sizeof' to incomplete type `termios2'
Will copy the i386 version into ARM's termbits.h
