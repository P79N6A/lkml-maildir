Yes I have spoken to Rogier about this before I posted it to LKML.
riocontol calls several functions like RIONewTable.  Which in the past
had returned ENXIO etc etc.  These positive returns where then had thier
sign switched in the riocontrol line above.  This patch was supposed to do
2 things 1) make the rio drivers conform to the more general "negative on
error" convention for most functions and 2) bring the code more inline with 
the version in 2.5
Howver looking closer, which I should have done BEFORE I posetd here
shows that this patch doesn't fix all places so the patch above is bad indeed.
I'll spend some time reauditing the code and fixing trhe places I missed and 
then retrans.
Yours Tony
