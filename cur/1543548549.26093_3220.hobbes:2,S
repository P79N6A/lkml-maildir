It's not impossible. Think when you run a backup of you home directory
while you're listening mp3. Both `tar` and `xmms` will read the same file
that is out of cache.
`tar` will be the first one who will read the next out-of-cache data-page
of the file. The I/O will be so issued with low prio but then, as soon as
`tar` has issued the read I/O, also `xmms` will wait on the same page and
it will skip the next deadline because the I/O is been issued with low
prio.
To make it work right is not simple.
