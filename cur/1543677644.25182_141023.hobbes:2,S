Well, are you talking about a socket or a disk? Obviously, those are very 
different devices, and hence have very different objects that you create 
for them. 
One way or another, you should be exporting attributes under the directory 
of the object that you create. If it's a socket, put it under the socket 
directory above. If it's a disk, then it will have a directory in another 
location for which you can export attributes. 
Do you have a specific example, or are you just hypothesizing?
