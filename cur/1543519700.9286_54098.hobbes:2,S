That isn't the point though, my suggestion was to use this file to locate
the kernel headers themselves, not to just setup the build environment.
Two different things.
We want things to be as simple as possible for the average joe, if they
compile a kernel from /home/foo/ then it would be nice if compiling
modules automatically 'just worked'. I personally tend to use either
scratch space or /usr/local/src for my kernel builds.
