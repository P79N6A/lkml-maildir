I don't know whether Novell have an arrangement with the Well-Known Commercial Database and the Well-Known OLTP Benchmark to do runs like this.  Chinang is normally only too happy to build his own kernels with patches from people who are interested in helping, so that's probably the best way to do it.
I'm leaving for LCA in an hour or so, so further responses from me to this thread are unlikely ;-)
