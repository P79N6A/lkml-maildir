Larry, this is a point you have made several times and admittedly one I
agree with.  I fail to see how the high-end scaling will not compromise
the low-end and I am genuinely concerned Linux will become Solaris.
I do not know what to do to prevent it - and I am certainly not saying
we should outright prevent certain things, but it worries me.  You are
going to be in Ottawa next week?  Maybe we can talk about it...
