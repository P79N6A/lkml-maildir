My fault; My letters were wrong. 3.2G has the fix and is in v2.3.18.
3.2F was the broken driver. Have you tried v2.3.18?
I've been working on too many versions of the driver lately. 3.2H
is a version that makes the driver work on an Alpha machine. I haven't
submitted this version yet, but it is on our FTP site.
