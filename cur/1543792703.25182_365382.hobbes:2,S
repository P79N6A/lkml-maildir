Heh, thanks, Jeff, for bringing this subject up again, hasn't been that 
long ago

, which was indeed asked with nbd in mind. To remind you and others in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=111524157800004&r=1&w=2

I played a bit with extending nbd to map block devices to the client 
system more transparently, which means, as James Bottomley explained, 
basically supporting REQ_BLOCK_PC requests. He also suggested not to use 
ioctls on both sides, which is where I stopped. I can understand how to 
avoid implementing ioctl in the nbd driver and intercepting REQ_BLOCK_PC 
requests instead, but on the server side? Assume you get the request 
object on the client, send it to the server, and then? Even if there 
existed a generic interface to block devices, allowing to inject requests 
directly from user space into block queue, wouldn't the same problems with 
endianness, 32/64 bit stay? The advantage, perhaps, would be that the 
request structure is standard, so, the conversion would be universal?
So, my problem is - how to send a generic request to a device (disk / 
cdrom / loop / sg / st / ...) from the user space? Hence my recent 
question...
Thanks
