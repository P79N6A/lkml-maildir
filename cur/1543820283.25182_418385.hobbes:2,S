Yeah, I knew that used to be true, but I was hoping the new interfaces 
would have made it obsolete. Especially as the DRM layer _does_ now enable 
the device on demand.
Maybe just add a DRM command to do it, so that old X versions (who don't 
know about it) will just do it by hand, and then new X versions can do
	if (drm_ioctl(fd, DRM_SETUP_THE_DAMN_RESOURCES) < 0) {
		/*
		 * I don't know what errno the drm-ioctl actually
		 * returns for unrecognized commands, so this is
		 * just an example
		 */
		if (errno == ENOTTY) {
			old kernel: do it by hand
		}
	}
which allows us to go forward in a sane way, and finally leave the broken 
X PCI-configuration-by-hand crap behind.
Please?
