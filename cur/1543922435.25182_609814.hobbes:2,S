SELinux couldn't do it when I wrote my own module, it may do now but I
haven't checked - that's also far too much extra configuration overhead
to do something relatively simple.

It's also much harder to maintain it internally too since it can no
longer be compiled as a module. If it were possible to have to make LSM
usable as a module but without secondary support, that would make
development easier - although secondary support is so trivial I doubt
it makes a difference to the possibility of allowing it to be compiled
as a module again.

You're only going to be forcing me to spend *my* time developing it into
something that could be accepted into the kernel when it works fine for
me already. Then I'd have to convince the LSM maintainer(s) that it
should be merged - this isn't like an external hardware driver where
there's no existing support in the kernel.
