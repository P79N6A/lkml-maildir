Hi,
 I'm using an isdn connection with a pcbit card (manufactured in
Portugal).
 Since kernel >=2.2.4. I'm unable to get any connection getting the
following messages on /var/log/syslog :
Apr  2 01:43:12 cavern kernel: ippp0: dialing 0 0800200558... 
Apr  2 01:43:20 cavern kernel: isdn_net: local hangup ippp0 
Apr  2 01:43:20 cavern kernel: fsm error: event 4 on state 1 
Apr  2 01:43:20 cavern kernel: ippp0: Chargesum is 0 
Apr  2 01:43:27 cavern kernel: ippp0: dialing 0 0800200558... 
Apr  2 01:43:27 cavern kernel: fsm error: event 1 on state 1 
Apr  2 01:43:35 cavern kernel: isdn_net: local hangup ippp0 
Apr  2 01:43:35 cavern kernel: fsm error: event 4 on state 1 
Apr  2 01:43:35 cavern kernel: ippp0: Chargesum is 0 
 fsm error : it's a message from edss1.c file on
/usr/src/linux/drivers/isdn/pcbit 
 As those files aren't changed for long time on kernel versions,
probably it could be anything else.
 It isn't any isdn configuration cause when I use 2.2.3. kernel image on
LILO it works.
 Sorry for not having no idea to resolve that. Could someone help me !?
 Thanks.
 Best regards,
