True.

Yes, but this module is loaded from SuSE's initrd, so it is loaded
before the root file system is mounted. Might it be that "rootfstype" is
already checked as the initrd is mounted rather then when the actual
root is mounted? If so, fs/super.c deserves fixing, but I'm not
acquainted with that code, so I cannot tell or fix that now.

Sure, but tell newbies how to do that. (Tell distributors first. :-)

Yup, reiserfs is last in /proc/filesystems when loaded as module, but on
my private machine (where it's linked into the kernel), it's right after
ext2 and before vfat.

Because I wasn't sure about the superblock checking behaviour of msdos.o
and whether this would harm reiserfs.o. I'm not telling newbies things
when I'm not absolutely sure they don't make things worse, I don't want
to scare them away from Linux.
Ewald, can you try
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda13 bs=512 count=1
from your rescue system and then check if your actual system boots
properly without help of SuSE's install floppies/CD?
