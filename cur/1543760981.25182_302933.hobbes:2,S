Dear Kernel People
Please advise... Long ago when I didn't use WEP I had my intenal (Network controller: Intersil Corporation: Unknown device 3872) and pcmcia belkin F5D6020
(probably version 1) working as charm wo tweeking (although I thought I
had to set RTS to 256 or call cardctl reset from time to time...)
Then I moved to Netgear WG511 using prism54 driver. Everything was
working well till (after some of the upgrades around 2.6.7-8) it start
freezing up my laptop completely. Although SysRq combination still can
reboot it, nothing else works. First I thought that it has something to
do with hardware (I got inside the laptop couple of times either to fix
LCD or touchpad or fan) because it seem to coincide with movement of
laptop -- I move it and it dies... but it died couple of times without
any physical effect... also it doesn't die with other kinds of pcmcia
wireless cards but died with the same model when I exchanged it...
Then I switched to my internal card and I came back to issues which
seems to be general for my laptop and pcmcia orinoco cards because I've
tried belkin as well and after 1-2 minutes of work they start start
reporting
Mar 14 21:56:28 localhost kernel: eth3: Error -16 transmitting packet
Mar 14 21:56:28 localhost kernel: hermes @ IO 0x100: Error -16 issuing command.
syslog and cardmgr become busy as hell... laptop becomes useless...
I had to take Belkin card away from slot but here are some details:
(I'm running 2.6.11.3 at the moment)
