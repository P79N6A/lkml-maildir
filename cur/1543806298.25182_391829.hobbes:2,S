Hi Dipankar, thank you very much for doing these tests.
To have an idea of the number of files that are allocated/freed during a 
kernel build, I added 4 fields in struct files_stat.
4th field is the central atomic_t nr_files.
5th field is the counter of allocated files.
6th field is the counter of freed files.
7th field is the counter of changes done on central atomic_t.
(Test machine is a dual Xeon HT, 2 GHz)
# make clean
# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
119     0       206071  119     39169   39022   1131
[root@localhost linux-2.6.16-rc1-mm4]# time make -j4 bzImage

153     0       206071  153     755767  755620  5119
So thats (755767-39169)/(4*60+56) = 2420 files opened per second.
Number of changes on central atomic_t was :
(5119-1131)/(4*60+56) = 13 per second.
13 atomic ops per second (instead of 2420*2 per second if I had one atomic_t 
as in your patch), this is certainly not something we can notice in a typical 
SMP machine... maybe on a big NUMA machine it could be different ?
