Nope, I saw that before the patch.  My patch was, in any case, to a
single .c file, not a header file, so it wouldn't spew like that.
It compiled and booted, I moved on :)
So solve that warning you probably need to shuffle the delicate balance
of includes around so that linux/sched.h, where mm_struct is defined, is
included before binfmts.h.  Or have binfmt.h include sched.h (which
should work... but its all kinds of nested nastiness)
