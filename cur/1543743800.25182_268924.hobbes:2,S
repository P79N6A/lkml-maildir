It's been like that since 2.4.4.  I suspect it started out as a mistake,
but it's been like that for so long, I've been reluctant to change it
for fear of what might break instead.

That seems a reasonable thing to do, and it may be okay even
despite the misleading advertizement of tmpfs in /proc/filesystems,
if the mount fails as it should.

This is the really bad part, that is new behaviour in 2.6.9, and
my fault for not thinking harder about MS_NOUSER.  Worse than that,
it leaves the directory in a bizarre state, "Not a directory" when
you try to list it for example - Anton reported this weeks ago, but
we couldn't reproduce it, not knowing it needed CONFIG_TMPFS off.
Please try the patch below (against 2.6.9, I'll send Andrew and Linus
the same for 2.6.10-rc later, with proper comment), it fixes mount to
fail cleanly when CONFIG_TMPFS is off.  Let us (or Debian) know if it
also then fixes the Debian udev initialization in this case.
Thanks,
Hugh
