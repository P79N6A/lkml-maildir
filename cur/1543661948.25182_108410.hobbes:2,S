At least for big directories it should be at least a quite obvious
microoptimization, if you do it at the logical level. Maybe it wasn't
worthwhile in the past (like in ext3) because it was done at the block
layer with a dumb reada rather than with proper read of the next logical
block before wait_on_buffer. Also keep in mind the max readahead
generated by the block layer is nothing compared to the true readahead
that the logical layer is able to generate.
