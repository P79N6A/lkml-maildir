actually, the client side of ptrace isnt all that more complex. I guess 
one of the main problems with using ptrace was that it has no catchy 
name that Andrea could claim for his project and that it couldnt be 
patented ;-)
Andrea could have isolated the 'client side' functionality of ptrace 
(which is often confused with the 'server side' of ptrace - where the 
overwhelming majority of ptrace security holes were located) and he 
could have made it simple to review, to get a comparable 'feeling' of 
security. [User Mode Linux uses the client-side ptrace model to execute 
untrusted code.]
Andrea could also have extended ptrace to solve whatever marginal 
problems he has with ptrace. [in fact such extension of ptrace was 
posted recently, see Roland McGrath's utrace framework!]
But he chose not to do so - and that has nothing to do with being unable 
to improve ptrace - it evidently is improvable. So i see SECCOMP being 
the result of the NIH syndrome.
