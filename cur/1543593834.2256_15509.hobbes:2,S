No, it was the bug the checker thought it was: a signed integer from
user space that had only been upper-bound checked.  If the value had
been unsigned, or had been checked in a range lower_bound < x <
upper_bound there woulnd't have been a message.
But I certainly concede that the message could be more informative.
