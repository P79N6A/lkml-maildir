The SCSI ASSERT_LOCK() were never used from kernel space, they are for
the user space similator. So it was always single threaded from there
and has no bearing on what actual kernel code does.
For MUST_NOT_HOLD to work, you need to take into account which processor
took the lock etc.

Your current version is surely worthless.
