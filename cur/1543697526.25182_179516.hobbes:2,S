Actually, it _does_ seem to make a difference. The irq probe doesn't 
report failure any more:

so now we have happily apparently probed the irq, but the problem is that 
it continues to scream afterwards. So we're still unhappy, but something 
did actually change. 
I wonder why ACPI matters. It must be changing the polarity or trigger of 
the irq somehow - but your earlier dmesg output seems to imply that it 
only changes ELCR for irq9, so it must be somewhere else. Len, ideas?
Also, Marco, it might actually be a VIA IDE driver bug, that leaves the 
interrupt on during setup somewhere (and the bug just doesn't matter when 
the IRQ is edge-triggered). So it would be interesting to know what 
happens if you disable the VIA-specific IDE support...
(Btw, thanks for being so good at testing, despite the lack of major 
progress).
