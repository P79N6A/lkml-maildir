The way patch 2 uses the pids is stupid, it was just the easiest way to 
implement it correctly ;-)  I work with, do it stupid but correct first, 
then optimize.

This is far from a fast path, and I can easily fix it. The hard work was 
the rest of the patch not this part. I even did it stupid knowing that I 
would be rewriting it to handle namespaces. I stated that this needed to 
be fixed in the patch itself.
One thing I never got an answer for, using the namespace pid path, can I 
still select the idle task to trace, i.e. pid == 0.
