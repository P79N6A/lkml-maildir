From what I can tell from Sun's Trunking manual, and working with the
software, it doesn't ever really round robin the packets..
Your ethernet address determines  which channel of the bundle you use;
and you get stuck with it.
No real load balancing there..

This works.
I know; I'm doing it today.  I've sent the bonding patch for 2.2 to
Alan; some comments and changes will probably occur (but not for at
least a week; I'm headed out for a few days..)
The network support people prefer to setup the channel by manually; they
don't trust the auto detect code.
