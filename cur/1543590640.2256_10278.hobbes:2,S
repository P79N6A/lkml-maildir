I believe the point is to establish whether or not you are receiving mail
from the list, plus maybe get an idea of the post/receive turnaround time.
If you fail to receive your own message after an acceptable [to you]
period of time, _then_ you escalate the situation by hassling the relevant
admins, or sacrificing the appropriate chickens, or whatever.
