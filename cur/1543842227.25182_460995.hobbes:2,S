How about this:
1. Incoming mail from subscribers is accepted
2. Incoming mail to honeypot addresses is trained as SPAM
3. Incoming mail from non-subscribers is marked with X-Bogofilter:
4. A handy Perl script subscribes to lkml, and for any message it gets 
with an X-Bogofilter: SPAM header, it sends a notification (rate-limited) 
to the message sender explaining that his message will be filtered as SPAM 
by some recipients, and inviting him to contact postmaster to resolve the 
issue, and additionally letting him know that notification is rate-limited 
and there is a website he can check to see the SUBJECTs of all messages 
filtered as SPAM on lkml (say for the last week or two) if he wants to try 
and correct the problem himself.
Thanks,
Chase
