Subject: [uPATCH] 2.3.28 possible use of uninitialized value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This prevents a silly compiler warning about nsems getting used
uninitialized... since the possible use in ipc_free at line 625 is
protected by a condition that can't happen in the one case where nsems
isn't initialized (at line 505), this is more about the compiler not
noticing this than anything else, but it clears a warning nonetheless
(egcs 1.1.2)
