OK, I'll do this tomorrow morning (I think I can do it without a serial 
console now).

The only odd thing I think I'm doing is hacking this into rc.sysinit:
awk '/version 2\.5\./ {exit 1}' /proc/version || egrep -v '^#' /etc/sysconfig/modules | while read i
do
        action $"Loading $i module: " /sbin/modprobe $i
done
This might be naughty, but it shouldn't be able to hang the box!
I'd prefer to have a proper set of aliases for 2.5 in /etc/modules.conf,
but I'm too lazy to google for one. Also, I'd prefer yet more to shunt
this stuff into an initramfs but I'll wait for documentation to appear for
that :)
Cheers,
Matt
