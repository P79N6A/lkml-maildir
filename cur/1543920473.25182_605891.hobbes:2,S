usb_set_interface() is smart enough to remove the old interface files
before creating new ones, since it expects them to exist already.  
Hence there's no problem in that scenario.
But usb_set_configuration doesn't expect there to be any pre-existing
interface files, because there isn't even an interface until the
registration is performed.

For a couple of reasons.  The "interface" attribute file contains the
iInterface string descriptor, and that file is present only if such a
descriptor exists.  Since different altsettings might not agree on
whether or not iInterface exists, the attribute has to be created anew
for each altsetting.  (Yes, we could let the file always be present and
just be blank if there is no descriptor.)
The most important reason has to do with the endpoint pseudo-devices.  
Different altsettings can have different endpoints, so those have to be
removed and re-created whenever the altsetting changes.
