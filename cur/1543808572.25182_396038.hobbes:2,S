How does x86_64 manage to get 'additional_cpus' parsed early enough? As far
as I can see this is done when parse_args() in start_kernel() gets called,
but that's after you need the parameter in prefill_possible_map().
IMHO that should be an early_param and you would need to call
parse_early_param() from setup_arch(). But then again, maybe I got it all
wrong.
But the more interesting question is: what do you do if the command line
contains both additional_cpus and maxcpus. I was just trying to make some
sense of this, but the result is questionable.
I ended up with a cpu_possible_map that has 'present cpus' +
'additional_cpus' bits set. And in smp_prepare_cpus I make sure that
cpu_present_map has not more than max_cpus bits set.
At least that doesn't break the current semantics of the maxcpus parameter.
But we're still wasting memory, since it would make sense that the
cpu_possible_map shouldn't have more than max_cpus bits set.
