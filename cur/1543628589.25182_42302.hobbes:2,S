Just an added vote of confidence,..
They looked sane enough that I used them to sync my tree up to a few
csets short of 2.5.9 over the weekend, (after 2.5.9 final I diffed the
tree with csets -> 2.5.9 and then merged that).
The only time this method of me keeping up with Linus falls over is when
files move or are deleted. No patch seems to be deleted there, so
there's nothing for me to apply.. I can live with this though.
