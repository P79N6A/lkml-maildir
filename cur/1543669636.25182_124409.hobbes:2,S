You are talking about the "issue" of /dev/foo going away because that
device was removed, and then another device added which creates /dev/foo
just as the user starts to open /dev/foo?  Or something else?

If udev becomes a deamon, disk access isn't needed.  Actually the
current version of udev doesn't require any disk access, other than
loading it into memory.

So yes, doing this in userspace causes a number of these kinds of
"problems".  The same kinds of "problems" that all other user programs
have to deal with, right?
So, if udev can't be read from the disk, the machine isn't in a very
workable state, creating that new device node is going to be the least
of your worries.
If udev can't get access to memory (actually it does no malloc calls, so
it would have to run out of stack space), or there is no memory to load
udev into memory, then again, you have a unstable machine, and there's
not much else we can do about it.

If you have 4000 disks, you have to have a _lot_ of memory just to deal
with it.  See the other 4000 disk threads for more discussions about
this issue.
If we fix up the kernel to handle that many different disks, then
userspace can surely handle 4000 tasks (it can handle that today,
right?)
Anyway, it will be quite difficult to plug 4000 disks in "all at once".
There is a time delay inbetween discovering each of those disks from
within the kernel, not to mention the physical issues of spinning them
all up.

Yes, if you lose a remove, things can get out of whack.  My goal is to
not lose any.

Nothing.  udev requires that the kernel assign a major/minor to a
device, which means that a driver has to be bound to the device.
Binding drivers to devices is the current hotplug task, and has nothing
to do with udev (with the exception that we have to be able to call both
programs for each hotplug event, but I'm working on that.)
