The status of the VIA drm is as follows, AFAICT:
1. I would consider it secure. I have a minor update coming in in a day 
or so.
2. The command verifier sometimes reject 3D command streams that should 
not be rejected. Some work to fix but cannot be done immediately (at 
least not by me.)
3. The AGP ring-buffer could hang under heavy 3D load. Without input 
from VIA I believe this is hard to fix.
