   No. Add a pointer to the mapping in the graphics context, and you
   can do the same thing. Each graphics context gets associated with
   the particular mapping you have.
This is precisely one of the other suggestions I was going to make.
It's pretty straight forward:
dre_nopage(vma, address) {
	     struct dre_kernel_state *p;
	     p = dre_lookup(vma->vm_mm, address);
             if (p->card->owner != p) {
		lock(p->card);
		remove_mappings(p->card->owner);
		idle_graphics_engine(p->card);
		save_card_state(p->card->owner);
		reload_card_state(p);
		p->card->owner = p;
		unlock(p->card);
	     }
	     fill_in_page_table(p->card, vma, address);
}
And then you provide an ioctl or whatever interface so that
the graphics library can tell you which addresses to associate
with which rendering state instance (for the dre owners, and
the lookup function).  It's pretty complex isn't it? :-)
And it's amazing, no other part of the kernel even knows
about what you're doing. :-)
