Ok, have a look at my prototype VGA arbiter. I need something similar to
spot the "default" VGA device at boot, maybe your stuff could be moved
completely to the arbiter ?

What I mean is your code won't work afaik, you should check the one
which has MEM/IO enabled. On PPC, I don't know, depends on the firmware,
pretty much all pmac cards come with the legacy decoding disabled anyway
(they are fully posted in "native" mode by the firmware).
Some PPC's have x86 emulators and/or some VGA capabilities, but then, I
expect only one of them to be left enabled by the firmware.
