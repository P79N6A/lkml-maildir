Optional, optional, all of these features are separate capabilities
carefully orthogonalized.
One merely has the option of combining them together.  In the Jeremy
Allison case, he wants it to be the case that updating any member of a
directory (emulating updating in W2k any stream of a file) updates the
stat data for the directory (emulating in W2k the file).  Note that one
can inherit some stat data but not other stat data.
Best,
Hans
