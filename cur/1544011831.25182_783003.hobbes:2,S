The only fine detail (i.e., the only place where the blur operation would 
remove something important from the image) in the old logo was the eyes of the 
penguin. This is the point where the viewer's attention is normally expected 
to be focused. In the new logo, there are three distant places where one has 
to focus the attention: the eyes, "6", and "4".
