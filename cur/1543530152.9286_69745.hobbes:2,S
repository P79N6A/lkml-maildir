   Not at all. If syslogd chooses (1), system logging will automatically
start working again when memory is freed. (2) would required external
action to restore system logging, even when memory becomes available again.
(2) is clearly not what you want for a program like syslogd. The same goes
for init, inetd, named, sendmail, httpd, nfsd, etc.
