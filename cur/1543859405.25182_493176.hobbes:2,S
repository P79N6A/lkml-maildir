My reason for writing the patch was to track which processes are
active (i.e. got scheduled to run) by polling these context switch
values.  The time used values are not a reliable way to detect process
activity on fast machines.  So for example, when sorting by %CPU, top
often shows many processes using 0% CPU, despite the fact that these
processes are running occasionally.  If top sorted by (%CPU, context
switch count delta), it might give a more useful display of which
processes are active on the system.
More generally, it seems perverse to track these context switch values
but only expose them through the constrained getrusage interface.  If
they are worth having, why aren't they worth exposing in the same way
as all other process info?

That would be a much more useful system call than getrusage.  But why
have two ways of retrieving process info, /proc and a sys_get_rusage,
exposing differing subsets of process information?
