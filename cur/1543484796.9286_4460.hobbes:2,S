Does anyone have ipmasqadm working in 2.2.1?
[root@wibble /root]# ipmasqadm portfw -f
[root@wibble /root]# ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L localhost 30 -R wibble
23
[root@wibble /root]# ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L wibble 30 -R wibble 23
Now, unless I'm being stupid, which is entirely possible, connecting to
port 30 of wibble should effectively be the same as connecting to port 23
of wibble.  But, from wibble:
[root@wibble /root]# telnet wibble 23
Trying 10.2.4.2...
Connected to wibble.cipe.
Escape character is '^]'.
Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo)
Kernel 2.2.1 on an i486
login:
[root@wibble /root]# telnet localhost 30
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
[root@wibble /root]# telnet wibble 30
Trying 10.2.4.2...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
And from another box:
[mike@bounce p]$ telnet wibble 23
Trying 10.2.4.2...
Connected to wibble.cipe.
Escape character is '^]'.
Red Hat Linux release 5.2 (Apollo)
Kernel 2.2.1 on an i486
login:
[mike@bounce p]$ telnet wibble 30
Trying 10.2.4.2...
(hangs)
The effect seems to be the same whichever version of ipmasqadm I use
(0.4.1 or 0.4.2).  It behaves similarly if the remote machine really is a
remote box.
What gives?
