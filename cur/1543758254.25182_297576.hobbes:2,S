That driver is buggy for other reasons, but thankfully doesn't show
itself very often...
However, that isn't the one I was talking about, since I was talking
about an unmerged driver.
There are a number of ARM platforms which use a Ricoh RTC chip, and
the driver for this will live in drivers/i2c/chips/ricoh-rtc.c.  This
is a stand alone driver in its own sense, handling the power management
issues (saving the time offset/restoring the time) and setting the
system time upon its initialisation.  (In turn, this requires some i2c
patches which add power management to the i2c subsystem to be merged
first.)
It's already used in some ARM platforms, including one which I was
involved in.  It just hasn't been merged.
As far as drivers/acorn/char i2c rtc stuff goes, I plan to make this
a full and proper i2c citizen, so adding breakage to the Kconfig with
random select statements for publically viewable symbols isn't the
way to go.
