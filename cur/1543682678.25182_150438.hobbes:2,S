Hi all,
I have just switch from kernel 2.4.20 to kernel 2.4.21, and my TV card
(Miro PC/TV, BT878) stopped to work. I got a lot of the following messages 
when I try to access /dev/video0:
bttv: vmalloc_32(8519680) failed
bttv: vmalloc_32(8519680) failed
...
While grepping vmalloc in the kernel sources, I found the following line
in include/asm-i386/page.h:
#define __VMALLOC_RESERVE       (128 << 20)
I changed the value to 128 (MBytes I suppose) to 256, and my TV card 
started to work.
My computer is an AMD Ahtlon XP1800+, with a KT266A chipset and 1 GBytes
of RAM (and thus HighMem is enabled).
Has anybody the same problem, and is there other solutions to solve the
problem?
Cheers,
Aurelien
