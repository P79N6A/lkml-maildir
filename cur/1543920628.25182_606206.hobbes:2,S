Righto, it's invalid to call sg_next() on the last entry! Let me know if
you need any help with debugging this, unfortunately I cannot test on
sparc64 myself...
(I can say that easily, since I know that davem will a) not rest until
this is fixed, and b) is a really good debugger and will not need my
help)
