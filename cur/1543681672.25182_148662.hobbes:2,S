Subject: BUG REPORT 2.4.22-pre5/pre6: nfs-clients 2.4.21 stall under heavy load on server 2.4.22-pre5/pre6

Hello,
subject says about all I can tell. If you take around 20 clients and let them
do heavy nfs action on a 2.4.22-pre5/pre6 server some seem to draw bad cards
and
stall forever with:
Jul 13 02:02:35 test-2 kernel: nfs: server nfsserver.in.my.domain not
responding, still trying
These messages show up with other kernels on server, too. But I cannot remember
one where they do never recover. Even under 2.4.22-pre5/pre6 server they often
recover, but not always. 
If there is something to test or you need further information please let me
know.
Regards,
Stephan
