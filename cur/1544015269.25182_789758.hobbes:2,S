I think they are, though I have to read them more thoroughly yet.

Yes, they are.  You implement either the "old" ones (->suspen(), ->resume(),
->suspend_late(), ->resume_early() in struct pci_driver) and even if only one of
them is defined, the "legacy" handling will be used for the other operations
too, so the existing drivers' code is not affected, or the "new" ones (the pm
object).

Yes, it is, unfortunately.  There are a couple of reasons, one of them being
that the code has only been finished recently and another that the whole
concept changed slightly just before 2.6.28, when we discovered a mode of
failure that had not been known before and it had to be taken into account.
I'm now going to finally write some documentation. :-)
Thanks,
