Yes.  I personally know very little about the LVM snapshot code and I wasn't
aware of its capabilities.  If we can make it possible to run the user space
safely after we've created the memory snapshot, I'm all for it.
As far as the package is concerned, we can just add the new user space tools
to the suspend package containing our existing userland part.
