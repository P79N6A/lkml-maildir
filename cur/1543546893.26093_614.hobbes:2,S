Hi all, 
I have similar problems with a PS/2 mouse on my machine and 2.4.0-test7.
The mouse works ok under X if gpm is not loaded. When loading gpm -t ps2
(gpm 1.19.3) the mouse doesn't work at all in textmode. After killing
gpm and starting it a second time, the machine freezes. This is 100%
reproduceable. I've tried the patch Kevin Buhr posted but it doesn't
change things.
Machine is: i686 Linux-2.4.0-test7 (vanilla)
It's an uniprocessor machine without SMP support, hence the spinlock
issue above doesn't apply here.
IRQ assignment is as follows:
irq  0:    178330 timer                 irq  9:         0 acpi
irq  1:      3427 keyboard              irq 10:     53381 ide0, ide1
irq  2:         0 cascade [4]           irq 11:        23 bttv
irq  5:     29039 eth0                  irq 12:     49690 PS/2 Mouse
irq  6:         2                       irq 13:         1 fpu
irq  7:         1 parport0 [3]          irq 14:       708 ide2
irq  8:         1 rtc                   irq 15:     93661
EMU10K1               
I seem to remember that the mouse worked with earlier 2.4.0-testX
versions, but I can't exactly tell at which point things broke.
Regards,
Udo Steinberg.
