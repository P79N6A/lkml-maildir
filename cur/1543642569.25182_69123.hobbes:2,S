On a VIA VP6 (Apollo Pro133x) dual-pIII (hde is on a HPT370), using 2.4.19-rc1-ac1 or
2.4.20-pre5, if I boot using "nosmp=1", I have
hde: lost interrupt
(followed by a system stall for a few seconds)
each time hde is accessed (starting with partition table read). When
hde7 is mounted, I see a never-ending series of:
hde: 0 bytes in FIFO
ide_dmaprobe: chipset supported ide_dma_lostirq func only: 13
hde: lost interrupt
The boot takes forever (I didn't even try to boot completely). This
doesn't happen when booting normally.
nosmp=1 noacpi=1 doesn't help.
