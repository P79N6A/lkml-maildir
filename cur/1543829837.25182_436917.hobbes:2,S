Yes, you definitely need to comment out the other call if you test the
SMP path on UP+IO-APIC.

Something is certainly still b0rken.  I still get three different
answers to the question "what is my cpu usage" depending on
configuration.  With stock UP kernel with no IO-APIC, interrupt load is
all hi.  With your patch and IO-APIC, it's all si.  SMP shows a mix of
both.
I like the result of using the SMP path if you have an IO-APIC best,
though I haven't verified them against a profile for accuracy.  Taking a
peek at the profile confirms that it is indeed mixed, so anything
showing the load as being either hi or si has to be wrong.
