Why is that crazy, we do that already today with the majority of drivers
in Linux.

Like Jeff said, many of these are quite old.

Any specific examples?  I have a long list of people who wish to write
new drivers but just don't know which hardware is not yet supported.

That's not true at all.  We have a whole raft of drivers in the kernel
that are supported only by the community (like the whole USB stack for
example) that vendors rely on working properly.
And again, I have a whole list of people who are competent to write
drivers wanting to do so (myself included), yet do not have any new
devices with specs to do it.
