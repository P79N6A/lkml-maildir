we did that too for quite some time in CFS - it was found to be "not 
agressive enough" by some folks and "too agressive" by others. Then when 
people started bickering over this we added these two simple corner 
cases - switchable via a flag. (minimum agression and maximum agression)

the terminology you used is perfectly fine.

heh, thanks :) For which workload does it make the biggest difference 
for you? (and compared to what other scheduler you used before? 2.6.22?)
