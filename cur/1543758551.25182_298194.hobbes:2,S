So even 0xe8 0x03 returns error?
Maybe we should send a command after this (any command), to make sure
the 
	psmouse->set_rate(psmouse, psmouse->rate);
call succeeds and is not confused by the 0xfc response.

That's OK. I'd like to keep the DMI probing as well, though, so it's not
absolutely necessary to provide the parameter.

Can you send any commands to the external mouse? How the touchscreen
reacts when the mouse starts sending 4-byte responses? We process the
external mouse packets inside lifebook.c anyway and we don't have any
support for the enhanced protocols there.
