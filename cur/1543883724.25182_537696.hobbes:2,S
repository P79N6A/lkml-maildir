I'll let Lucho give more details on his possible uses for such an
interface -- for my part we have been looking at doing in-kernel
servers for more efficient export of devices and system services (such
as the network stack).  We've been using user space applications for
doing such sharing, but there are undesirable inefficiencies in such
an approach.

I believe the log message was poorly worded, it was more of a
reorganization of the existing interface versus the creation of an
additional interface.

Which bits do you think are candidates for such a move?  The transport
interfaces? (there are a few more in the wings to cover shared memory
transports for VMMs among other things)  Should the protocol elements
move as well? -- that seems a bit fuzzier to me.
