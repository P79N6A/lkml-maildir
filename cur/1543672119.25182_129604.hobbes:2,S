Sounds like being a nice feature (esp. for 24/7 uptime), but it also
sounds like a *lot* of bloat. You'll have to encode (and to decode) any
single bit if data. But - where to put all that? See, it you're having
some Gigabytes of ram, you probably end with > 100MB only describing all

What do you do if drivers/mm/you-name-it changed and now uses different
data structures? In fact, any two choosen kernels may potentially use
different data structures. So for the newly-to-load kernel, you need
stream decoders for all possible older kernels. Bloat again.
So if I would need something like that, I think kexec is the way to go,
possibly with a second machine for failover (to even close the kexec
booting gap).
However - if you like this feature so much you'd die for: nobody stops
you to implement a proof-of-concept:)
