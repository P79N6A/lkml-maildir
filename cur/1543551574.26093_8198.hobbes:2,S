Subject: procfs question:  How many files are supported?

The VLAN code attempts to add a new file in /proc/net/vlan/ for each new
interface created.  However, when I create, say 4k interfaces, then only the
first 150 or so show up in /proc/net/vlan.
The interfaces exist, as shown by ifconfig and /proc/net/dev
So, is there some limit on the amount of files that you can add to procfs
in a single directory?
Suggestions welcome...
Thanks,
Ben
