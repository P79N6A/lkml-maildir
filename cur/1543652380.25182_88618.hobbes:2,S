The user space application will have to make a call to the driver
somehow. Usually this is in the way of an ioctl() on a device that the
driver has made available to use space. The arguments passed across the
ioctl are known to your kernel module and userspace app. You could pass
a pointer to the kernel module which would be userspace memory that the
driver could copy_to_user some data to.
