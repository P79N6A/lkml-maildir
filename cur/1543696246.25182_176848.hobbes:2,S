Actually, so what ?
If we use -ansi, it means we in theory only use u16 and u32 as
data types, and if the library that was compiled with u64 support
wish to convert the u32 array/buffer pointer we pass to it to
u64, it should make sure it setup things correctly.
Ok, so maybe above is not a case to work on, but if I write an
app that use only 32bit data types, and it links to a library that
also handles 64bit, it does not matter, as I do not call the functions
that handle 64bit data types, no ?
Thanks,
