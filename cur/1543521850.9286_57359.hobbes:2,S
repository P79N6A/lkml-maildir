   No, nobody took it seriously.
   What did happen was the automobile became a commodity item, and the
   pollution went up into the atmosphere.  Cars have their own horrible
   problems, but they (a) don't generate horse shit and (b) they
   encourage sprawl, which spreads the pollution around more.
   If the automobile wouldn't have been developed, London would most
   likely have banned horse traffic (or required that people using
   horses in the city carry pooper-scoopers) by the 1950s.
