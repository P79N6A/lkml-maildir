Hi,
    Recently ran across this bug on the 2.2.2 linux kernel(never noticed
it on old kernels, but its possible i never did what was needed to cause
it). Anyways, on cdr's when you put a disc in the cdr will read it for
about 4 or 5 seconds, if I attempt to mount while it is reading at first
I get this:
            [root@localhost /root]# mount /dev/cdrom
             bug: kernel timer added twice at c01b3d74.
To me this pretty obviously looks like a kernel bug(considering kernel
and bug are in the same line) =).
 and this will completely lock up whatever term i ran it from(only way i
knew how to get it back was a reboot). Anyways this can be a very
annoying little bug, and definately should be checked out.
        Take care,
                Kyle
