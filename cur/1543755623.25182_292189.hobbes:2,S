Great, thanks! Has the interface for multiblock modules changed or 
should my old modules work with it with no more effort?
Unfortulately I don't have a PadLock system running at the moment (it is 
still somewhere down in a wooden box after my moving), but if you send 
me the patch I could at least try to compile with my parts.
Thanks for that!
