Version
Changed:
  ~2.6.9_to_staircase9.0.diff
Latest version of staircase cpu scheduler. This is version8.K renamed in 
line with kernel release. There are no known bugs with this release. The 
main changes since last -ck released staircase are significantly better 
handling of subjiffy timeslices, and much larger timeslices for -niced 
processes as per mainline.
  ~schedbatch2.5.diff
  ~schediso2.8.diff
Resync with latest staircase.
  ~mwII.diff
The mapped watermark code was incompatible with newer vm changes so it 
was rewritten and is much less likely to cause oom. The same sysctls 
still exist (vm.mapped and vm.hardmaplimit), but the hardmaplimit is off 
by default. If you still have large amounts of swapping under heavy disk 
i/o I recommend turning this on.
  ~cfq2-20041019.patch
One small bugfix.
