I'm wondering if anyone's ever done an analysis on the average length
of instructions in an x86-built kernel.
Googling around, I can find references claiming that the average
instruction length on x86 is anywhere from 2.7 to 3.5 bytes, but I
can't find anything studying Linux specifically.
Just curious,
Karim
