Have a look at drivers/acorn/char/{i2c,pcf8583}.[ch]

If you look at the last 2.6-rmk patch, you'll notice that it contains
an abstracted RTC driver - I got peed off with writing the same code
to support the user interfaces to the variety of RTCs over and over
again.  (Ones which are simple 32-bit second counters with alarms
through to ones which return D/M/Y H:M:S.C format.)
