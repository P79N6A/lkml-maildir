Hi to you all,
I have a patch for the serial driver available for testing on my
homepage. The patch should provide support for any "dumb" serial PCI
card with very little effort (just filling in some entries in a table).
Take a look at <

 for more information
and the patch. Any feedback is very welcome!
Regards,
Otto
