There problem is that if you get something going crazy segfaulting your
logging itself can make the problem far worse. The rate limiting is as
much important to stop accidents as stop malicious attack.

Zero overcommit keeps it pretty sane - most times.

Which is good news and gives you a lot longer (or your tools a lot
longer) to react and sort it out. It also avoids the disk thrashing and
performance hit you can cause.

Its configurable easily enough so I'm not sure it matters which way it is
set, but it does need to be a -safe- default - either rate limited or off.
