The following sequence of patches makes the icap driver more robust,
by making better use of the status information from the cores.  In
addition, Lanana has assigned Major 259 for FPGA configuration
interfaces, so we now use it, rather than dynamically finding a major
number.
Grant: please pick these up for 2.6.26.  Do you think it's worth
patching virtex_devices.c at this point, or just punt on ARCH=ppc?
