Hello
I can't configure my  intel e1000 card with make menuconfig  
I try  to compile 2.4.21 RHEL 4 + patch freevps 1.5.7  see (www.freevps.com)
When I try to enter in Network Device Support --> Ethernet (1000) I 
obtain this error
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu36: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
