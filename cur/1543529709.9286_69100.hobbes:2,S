At which point in this did you do the VFS interface audit? It looks to me
as if you didn't do one - you just created and deleted lots of files, plus
a few other operations, then said "OK, it works, let's put it in the
kernel." This is NOT what was suggested above.
OK, your code handled a load of basic file operations on one machine. This
does NOT justify considering it read for inclusion. Follow the suggestion
above: Audit the interface between your code and the rest of the kernel
(i.e. the VFS interface). THEN, once you have done this in detail and
documented it, try again.
