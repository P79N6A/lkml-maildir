Does it's continued inclusion in your series signify anything?  If the 0.90
patch could service old style MD IOCTL's so that the old raid user tools
would continue to work affect the 2.2.x outcome?  I don't mean to re-hash
dead issues, but 2.6 seems a long way away for a stable series with raid
0.90 in it.
