Subject: One former member of ftp.jp.kerne.org needs deleting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/22/80

Sorry I cannot keep up with the mailing list.  If anyone has advice or
questions, please contact me directly.
ftp.jp.kernel.org resolves to 202.245.215.3, 192.26.91.193, and
202.224.39.21.  But 202.245.215.3 has very few files.  Until recently
202.245.215.3 responded to ftp, and it still does respond to http, yielding
a surprising http error 404 when trying to resume an interrupted download.
NUCBA used to provide splendid service to the Linux community but it no
longer does so.  202.245.215.3 really needs to be deleted from the
ftp.jp.kernel.org domain.
