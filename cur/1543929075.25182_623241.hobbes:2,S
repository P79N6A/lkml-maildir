dmesg and config attached.
I'm getting about three of each at boot. I'm running:
commit e1cca7e8d484390169777b423a7fe46c7021fec1
Date:   Thu Nov 29 16:25:29 2007 -0800
which is the latest git as of yesterday plus a one (unrelated) debug
statement patch in usb uhci.
There was a similar bug report after 2.6.23-rc8-mm was released. Though
there seems to be a fundamental problem with how people use
smp_call_function*() [1]. And this can just as well be another
incarnation of it.
Is that easy enough to fix or do I need to bisect (it didn't happen in
2.6.24-rc3)?
