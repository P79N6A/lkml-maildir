NT box causes oops in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I influenced my company to install Linux servers to provide internet,
mail and remote access services to the organisation. The oops's (or
rather the freezes) are becoming more & more frequent, 2 or 3 times
a day now since I moved to the 2.2.xx series kernel using RH6.0. I am
now under a lot of pressure to get this right.  
My question is --- DO I NEED TO CHANGE TO NT ??? (It's what others are
telling me!)
I posted an Oops report July 9th, and have subscribed to the mailing list
but nobody has picked up on this.  It seems to me that something in the
tcp stack is broken & needs to be fixed.  Looking through other postings
to the list it seems to me that there are a number of oops's which are
being caused by problems somewhere in the tcp stack.
In my case a oops, or freeze, is always preceded by the following message:
	Warning: kfree_skb passed an skb still on a list (from xxxxxx)
Looking at the code it is clear that this is a bad thing - the skb structure
is freed, but the list (which points to the structure) knows nothing about
this. It does not take long before the reference to a NULL address happens.
Here is the full oops report...
=====================================================================
1. PROBLEM: Kernel 2.2.xx - Oops in tcp_recvmsg()
===========================================================================
2. Full description
Normally my system hangs with no Oops message and no information at all
on screen.  I have once recieved an "oops" message, the detail of which 
is included below. The sequence of events, according to the syslog file,
is always the same - A person logs in from a Windows NT box via ISDN and
picks up mail using MS Outlook (yechh!) (using ipop3d service). Perhaps
by coincidence, although a number of people login remotely to the system,
the crashes have only occurred when one particular user logs in. The
final message, regarding "kfree_skb" does not always make it into the
syslog file although the preceding sequence of events is always the same.
When the "Oops" occurred the active process was "ipop3d".
The "Oops" was received using kernel 2.2.7 #SMP. However, the problem
has occurred with 2.2.5 and 2.2.10.
NB: Since the first posting, I have noticed that the difference between
the user who crashes the system and all the others is that, in her dial-
up-networking setup on NT she had enabled "modem error control" and 
"modem compression". I have switched these off - hopefully the problem
will dissapear. If it does, I will post to that effect. However, if this
is the problem I would hate for M$ to know that they can deliberately crash
a Linux server!
I have tried to include as much information as I think is relevant.
Thanks for your assistance in this matter. Please e-mail (or call) if
further information is required.

6. Cannot force the problem to happen. The person who logs in is successful 
most of the time. She logs in maybe 20 times a day. The problem happens once
or twice a week. Here are the last few lines out of syslog before the crash.
The lines are the same regardless of whether the Oops followed or not.
