Changed the PCI slot of eth2 to a 32-bit slot, and now it works better...
It passed packets for about 20 seconds, then spit out a bunch of these:
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth3: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
tg3: eth2: Error, poll already scheduled
... Then the machine locked hard
