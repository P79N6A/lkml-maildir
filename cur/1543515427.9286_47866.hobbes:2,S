Hi,
I just read in Kernel Traffic about the "access beyond end of device" saga.
The same thing happend at my machine, this weekend.
Kernel: 2.2.12
Harddisk: IBM 39130, connected via Adaptec 2940U2W (onboard on Asus P2B-S)
I didn't pay much attention to it, because
1.) I did not get any data corruption 
2.) I was blaming this error on multitrack, since it happend, when multitrack
	wrote a 600MB file, while at the same time, I did some I/O intensive
	ghostscript work. 
2.) is obviously wrong...
Just my $0.02
Ciao
  Christoph
