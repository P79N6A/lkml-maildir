For what it's worth, I spent some time trying to get kstrdup() fixed as well,
but gave up because:
a) The leak I was chasing was using kzalloc() ;)
b) I got stuck in a .h dependency loop - the prototype for kzalloc is in
slab.h, and by that point in slab.h, we've seen a prototype for __kmalloc().
Unfortunately, kstrdup() comes out of string.h, and there's usages where
string.h has been #included but we've not seen __kmalloc().  Unfortunately,
just #include'ing what's needed didn't work, because of the way the code
uses #ifndef _LINUX_FOO_H_ - when I started looking at having to #undef stuff
to get a prototype of __kmalloc(), I gave up. ;)
