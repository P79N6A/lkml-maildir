Chris: Based on your usage patterns, how would Linux know that you were
going to be opening up Mozilla, and not that you were going to tweak the
kernel source and compile it again?
The only time memory is wasted is when you don't have enough of it, and it
gets trampled for common operations that you perform. All other times, the
memory is loaded, because it was used, which means it might be used again.
