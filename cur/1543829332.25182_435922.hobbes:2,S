Yes indeed.  That shouldn't be an issue though.

I'm missing your point here.  How and where?

This is exactly the point, why do that expensive /proc operation when
you can do a quick vsyscall and get all of that information.  I'm not
sure if Aux is the right direction.

There will be (in all probability) requests to include as much as
possible, but I think that should be manageable with sensible API.

Okay. I just cooked that example for some monitoring process to find out
the interrupts /sec on that CPU.  But as you mentioned above sibling,
sockets, nodes, flags, and even other characteristics like current
p-state are all important information that will help applications
sitting in user land (even if some of them will be used only couple of
times in the life of a process).
Side note: I don't want to delay the vgetcpu call into mainline because
of this discussion (as long as there is no cpuid and tcache in that
call).
