He's was talking about it clearly as an experience RT app developer.
His points are clear and clearly show that he's written and run into
a lot of these same issues writing medium to large RT apps.

That's an RT begineer's question. You have to at least be up to speed
in that one to have the conversation at hand and folks have discussed
this repeatedly. It's not our end that failing and clearly you not
understanding this only reenforces this point..

I've been on vacation like most of us here and I'd like to avoid this
discussion over the weekend. But experienced RT app folks know this answer
already and that it's *not* created to put guarantees on this and "any thing
crossing the kernel boundary via a syscall" at this point. I've also said
this in previous emails but it went over your head or you didn't care to
to spend the time to understand mailings in the first place.

Again, you didn't understand the variety of services being discussed
here.
Think about what you need to do for app that does sound (hard RT),
3d drawing (mostly soft RT for this example), reading disk IO that's
buffered.
By the time you get the sound playback and IO buffering going, you're
going to get a pretty complicated commuication layer already going
from those points. Now think, what if you intend to do a FFT over that
data and display it ?
It's starting to get unmanagably complicated at that point.
