It's obvious when looking at the source code that both modules you are
trying to use are buggy, and the sum of the bugs in both modules is the 
drbd breakage you observe.
30% of the guilt go to the drbd developers for doing the following:
#ifdef NETLINK_ROUTE6
        /* pre 2.6.16 */
        err = cn_init();
        if(err) return err;
#endif
The author wanted to check for pre-2.6.14 when the connector code was 
added to the kernel, not for pre-2.6.16 as the comment implies or 
pre-2.6.13 as the code does.
Or he wanted to check whether it's a recent kernel and the connector 
code is compiled into the kernel.
70% of the guilt go to the web100 developers for shipping the following 
to their users:
--- linux-2.6-web100/include/linux/netlink.h	19 Jul 2007 17:49:17 -0000	1.1.1.16

That's not only buggy but also not used by web100.
