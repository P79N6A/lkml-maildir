Huh?  That's my staging tree for what goes to Linus and Andrew.
Yes, some patches in there are very old, and are not supposed to ever go
to mainline, but that is the minority.
I copied you when this patch was added to my tree, as I had reworked it
to be a bit more acceptable (no pointer arithmatic, proper coding style,
use the newer macros for endpoint detection, etc.), so you were aware
when this change was added.  If this patch does not work, please let me
know, and I will be glad to work to fix it.
thanks,
