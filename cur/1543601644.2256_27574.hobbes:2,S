1) We dont know if all "fixed" BIOS versions do it
2) We dont know if all motherboards do it
3) We dont have enough data points to determine if this is a "real fix" yet.
4) We dont know if they do it under all circumstances
   (eg do they read SPD and set it in some situations and not others)
   It may even be CPU rev specific.
IMHO its *FAR* too premature to be rolling this into production kernels
based on the scant evidence we have so far.
