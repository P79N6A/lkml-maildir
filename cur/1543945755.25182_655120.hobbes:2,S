Actually we've had the CX700 supported for a while and as Tejun has
fixed other bugs related to it we know its being used and tested. The
slave port is a bit quirky but that is purely in the way it seems to mess
up the snooping of mode changes. Yours is the first bug report of this
type so more information about the precise combination of devices used
and the actual logs would be useful.

No thats not a term I can guess at - do you have any logs with the exact
error reports in them ?
Also unfortunately you've compared 2.6.23 with 2.6.24 which means a bug
anywhere else could be causing the behaviour you see. It would be very
interesting to know if 2.6.24 built with old IDE rather than pata_via
(which is just config options) shows a difference in behaviour on your
box.
