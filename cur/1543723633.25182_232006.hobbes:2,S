The *other* time I spoke about error code... but it seems you don't have 
noticed the part *below* of my mail, the one where I describe what I complain 
about kernel memory corruption... read below:

And those datas are crap, obviously: the app wanted to write *buf to kernel 
memory, not *(buf-14), so we can have data corruption.
