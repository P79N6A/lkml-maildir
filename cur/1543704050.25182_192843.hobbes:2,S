Subject: 2.6.2-rc1 breaks Cisco VPN client 4.0.3.B

I know cisco_ipsec is a binary module, but since 4.0.3.B works on
  any 2.4 and 2.6.{0,1} kernels I thought I'd report this...
On starting the VPN connection 'cvpnd' goes in D state, running
  ps axlw shows it's stuck in __down.
Oh, and reboot obviously hangs. I can Alt-SysRq Sync and Umount
  but I can't reboot - atkbd.c reports too many keys pressed. Eh ?
Funny, it's three keys just as in the S and U case. It doesn't
  seem to like the 'B' letter. I can 'O'ff it though.
If any kind soul is interested in digging further in this, I'm
  as usual available to try stuff out.
Thanks & ciao,
