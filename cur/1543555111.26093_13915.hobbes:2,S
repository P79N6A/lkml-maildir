Wrong.  I've seen messages on bugtraq saying it is possible to "load"
modules into the kernel by patching /dev/kmem.  Even for loading modules
custom modules the normal way the attacker needs root priviliges (unless
you have a world-writeable /lib/modules...).  If this is the case it is
too late anyway...
