Bind is an Application-Level program. It should not include kernel headers 
directly. The various C runtime library headers do include kernel headers,
but you shouldn't do it directly in an application.
named/bind-8.1.1 and all its tools like addr, dig, dnsquery, host,
name-xfer, ndc, nslookup, and nsupdate all compile fine on my system.
This source was obtained from ftp.uu.net. It will compile on any
POSIX-Compliant system.
