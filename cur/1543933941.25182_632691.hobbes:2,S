ok. Is it more of a "gets flushed due to timing out", or a 
specified-for-sure POST flushing property of all out 0x80 cycles going 
to the PCI bridge? I thought PCI posting policy is up to the CPU, it can 
delay PCI space writes arbitrarily (within reasonable timeouts) as long 
as no read is done from the _same_ IO space address. Note that the port 
0x80 cycle is neither a read, nor for the same address.

i'm wondering, how safe would it be to just dumbly replace outb_p() 
with:
	out(port);
	in(port);
in these drivers. Side-effects of inb() would not be unheard of for the 
ancient IO ports, but for even relatively old SCSI hardware, would that 
really be a problem?
this would give us explicit PCI posting.

ah, i understand. So i guess a stupid udelay_serialized() which takes a 
global spinlock would solve these sort of races? But i guess making them 
more likely to trigger would lead to a better kernel in the end ...

we had port 0x80 removal patches floating in the past decade, and i'm 
sure if it broke anything for sure we'd know about it. It was always 
this "general scope impact" property of it that scared us away from 
doing it - but we'll do the plunge in v2.6.25 and make io_delay=udelay 
the default, hm? Thomas has a real 386DX system, if that doesnt break 
then nothing would i guess ;-) We wont forget about needed PCI posting 
driver fixups either because the _p() API use would still be in place. 
By 2.6.26 we could remove all of them.
