There is a strict limit to what is user visible, and if it isn't user visible
we will never need it in a checkpoint.  So internal implementation details
should not matter.

Except we do need something for pid isolation, and a pid namespace is
quite possibly the light weight solution.  If you can't see the pid it is
clearly isolated from you.
