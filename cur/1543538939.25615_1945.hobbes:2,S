Folks,
Please help :-)
I built and am successfully running kernel 2.3.99-pre6 on my AMD K3-400/ALI 
mb/EIDE based system, but have so far failed to run 2.4.0-test3.
Although I can build 2.4.0-test3, when it boots it tries to do a network 
boot rather than run from disk as it should.
I don't know how to get the kernel messages out, because it doesn't get to 
mounting a filesystem.
Can anyone help?
Ruth
