Thanks,you works.
I can boot linux-2.4.0-test5 on my mashine which source 
is from today's rsync  repositry.
My mashine is Apple's Blue/White G3 which have 4 HD interfaces.
it hasTwo IDEs Two SCSIs ,that have CMD646 and more slow IDE,
Adaptec 2940u2w and more slow scsi.
All HD interfaces are working on linux-2.2.17 very well.
I doesn't use the CMD646 and Adaptec 2940u2w on linux-2.4.0-test5.
Any  help?
Kaoru
