This fixes a longstanding bug with respect to bridge handling as well as
a Linux PCI faux pas, namely an attempt to support PCI domains with bus
number mangling.
The end result is that bridges off of quad 0 now work, and the code now
follows Linux PCI conventions.
[1/4] NUMA-Q: use sysdata as quad numbers in pci_scan_bus()"
[2/4] NUMA-Q: fetch quad numbers from struct pci_bus"
[3/4] NUMA-Q: use quad numbers passed to low-level config cycles"
[4/4] NUMA-Q: remove last traces of bus number mangling"
