I think making that a config is a really bad idea. What happens
when the user specifies a very large value. Or a very small one?
There are subtle dependencies with the boot loader, so this is
mostly a lie anyways.  And it doesn't really safe enough memory to 
bother with a CONFIG.
Also the last time I tried to increase this all kind of systems
with old bootloaders exploded (e.g. lilo on systems with large EDID
information - search the archives). Have these issues been resolved now? 
If yes then I would suggest to just double the default.
If not it cannot be changed anyways.
