When insert a CD-R that contains data and k3b is running the machine hard
locks. k3b writes on the console:
/dev/hdd READ TOC/PMA/ATIP invalid length returned
Disk info:

Used size: [...]
<crash>
Sys-rq doesn't work and there is nothing in the logs. I tested kernels back
to 2.6.14 and they all crash (I had problem booting .13 and .12... I'll try
again later). I also tried without iso9660 and udf support with same result.
Any clue ?
