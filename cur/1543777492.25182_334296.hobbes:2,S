Hello.
I'm using Linux Kernel 2.6.12.2 plus suspend 2.1.9.9 and acpi-20050408
with the hibernate-1.10 script. My machine is a Shuttle SK43G which
has a VIA KM400 chipset with an Athlon XP CPU.
Suspension seems to work well. However, when I resume, the keyboard is
dead and there is a warning in dmesg before and after suspension:
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio0. Some program, like XFree86,
might be trying access hardware directly.
Please include the following information in bug reports:

might be trying access hardware directly.
This machine doesn't have XFree86 on it.
I am presuming that this is a bug since I've used the exact same
kernel+patches (with hibernate 1.09 script) on another machine without
issues. I'm not sure if it's a suspension bug or if it's a kernel bug
that is brought to light by the suspend2 patches. If I'm wrong and
I've made a mistake, I'd love to hear it.
Thanks.
