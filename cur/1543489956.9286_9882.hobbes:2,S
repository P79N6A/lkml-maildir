	Ok. I'll assume it :-( . Anyway I finally get ATY-fb and Vesafb
running... (BTW, there is an error in 2.2.3 -and 2.2.3ac1- "make xconfig" 
that makes ATI Fb unavailable to the user. "make menuconfig" works right )

	Well, newer releases of these documents no longer include any 
information on them ( no sure if a bug, or features no supported )
	What is the way to assign each virtual console to a fb device?
some obsolete docs talk about "video=0123:..." or "video=map:" options
but it crashes on 2.2.3[ac1]
	Thanks in advance
