create_proc_entry() and friends for files, proc_mkdir() for directories,
proc_symlink() for symlinks and proc_mknod() for device nodes/named
pipes/sockets.
Statically allocated proc entries are GONE. Along with the mind-boggling
amount of cruft in the drivers, BTW - these days you don't need to know
about, trace the changes in or care about the struct proc_dir_entry.
IOW, forget about proc_register() - 'E's kicked the bucket, 'e's shuffled
off 'is mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir
invisibile!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!! <ahem> Sorry. It's not only not
exported - it's static in file and I'll probably rename it just to avoid
the patches trying to reexport the sucker.
Same goes for proc_unregister(), indeed - use remove_proc_entry() for
that.
BTW, statically allocated inode numbers in proc are also gone with one
(obvious) exception - root directory. The rest is dynamic, so you can stop
worrying about clashes with other modules, maintaining the list of magic
constants, maintaining patches to proc_fs.h, etc.
The bottom line: forget about the voodoo needed to deal with procfs - it
became very simple now.
