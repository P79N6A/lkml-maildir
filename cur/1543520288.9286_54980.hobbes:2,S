Hi guys,
Yesterday evening I thought "enough is enough - time to fix RAMDISK!" and
decided to play with it a bit.
I thought there are two ways to proceed:
 1. Maintain the original (Linus') idea of having a very subtle driver
    that depends too tight on the current (and future?) changes and state
    of Buffer and Page Cache subsystems.
 2. Abandon the above idea and implement a very simple driver that however
    is rock-solid to withstand any changes outside itself (provided
    kernel interfaces stay the same, of course).
So, I chose 2. as it was obviously easier :)
I don't call this "going back to static RAMDISK" as it is not truly static
- it vmalloc's the area for itself only on the first open so if you don't
use any ramdisks you don't waste any space.
Please review it:

Tested only plain ramdisk part (not initrd, i.e.)
Regards,
