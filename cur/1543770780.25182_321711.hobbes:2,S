Ok, this implies that the scheduler is really screwed up, we're not 
scheduling anything else during that time.
Ingo, this sounds like you need to take a look.
Pekka, can you confirm that the SysRQ output in your original email was 
from a "hung" time? Because that clearly shows that stuff is happening in 
user space, which means that it's definitely not a kernel loop.
Also, pipes are a bit special from a scheduling standpoint because they 
use the magic "synchronous wakeup" thing, and it might be worthwhile 
trying to just change the two calls to "wake_up_interruptible_sync()" in 
fs/pipe.c to the non-sync version (ie just remove the "_sync" part).

Indeed. 
One more thing: are those processes given RT priority? Because if so, it 
likely boils down to a wine bug again - a busy-looping high-priority 
process is _supposed_ to do what you see.
