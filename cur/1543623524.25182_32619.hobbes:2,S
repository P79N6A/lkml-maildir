Yes. And whats more the scsi generic layer has a hell of a lot less ioctls
than IDE because of that. With something like scsi enclosure, scsi smart,
scsi scanners its a godsend to be able to just say "Ok OS take a hike, I
wish to chat with this device exactly as I damn well please".
[Reminds me - anyone got any Linux enclosure monitoring code ?]
