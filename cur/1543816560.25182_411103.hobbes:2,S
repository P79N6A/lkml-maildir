There are today a great number of users of the existing kernel headers.
Introducing a new namespace for the userspace suers will leave them in a
dilemma where they have to support kernels before kabi, and kernels with
kabi. That alone will limit the acceptance of this.
So shifting to another approach where you take everything that we have
today and clean it up step by step will allow us in small steps to go
from current mess to a clean ernel ABI.
But we will not have this clean and virgin set of headers until a few
years ahead of us.
Keeping include/linux for the kernel ABI will allow us NOT to break
existing users and it will allow a stepwise apporach at the same time.
But what we make clean and virgin is the kernel specific stuff, not the
userspace specific stuff. In final result will be the same but shifting
focus to the kernel internal stuff allows us to do ti in incremental
steps that does NOT break userspace every and so often.
And we will only break external modules that does not use kbuild to
compile - and for hese I really do not care a whit.
Keeping the breakage minimal is the key point here.
