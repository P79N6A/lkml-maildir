there is no such notion as  "rights to move a file to a new container".
The same file can be opened in processes belonging to other containers.
And you have no any clue whether to have to change the owner or not.

The same for many other resources. It is a big mistake thinking that most resources
belong to the processes and the owner process can be easily determined.

I hope not that one used in ext[23]? :)
