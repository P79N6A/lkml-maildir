yeah, visual impact is everything. The best that Frank and me came up 
with is:
	_(socket_sendmsg, sock, size);
we could quickly learn to visually skip over lines like that, they have 
a pretty unique geometric form . While if it's called:
	trace_socket_sendmsg(sock, size);
it always looks like a function call in the corner of the eye and 
attracts attention.
the '_()' macro is defined as:
	#define _(x,y,z) STAP_MARK(x,y,z)
(STAP_MARK is an existing SystemTap helper to insert static tracepoints 
into the kernel.)
but the other property of dynamic tracing is still very important too: 
we have the technological freedom to remove static tracepoints, if we 
decide so. With static tracers, once they are in the tree, we are stuck 
with these APIs.
