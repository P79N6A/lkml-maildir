As an experiment, I applied all tty layer buffering revamping patched 
from 2.6.15-mm2 to the vanilla 2.6.15. There were two rejects in drivers 
that I don't even compile, I ignored them. The bug indeed manifested 
itself. There is no such bug in vanilla 2.6.15 kernel.
So please, remove these broken patches from mainline and give me some 
instructions how to debug this in -mm.
