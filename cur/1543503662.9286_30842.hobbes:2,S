I yet to see "correct parser" with ability to find out file-max, file-nr,
inode-max and inode0-nr moved from /proc/sys/kernel in 2.0 to
/proc/sys/fs in 2.2...

Of course. It's two step procedure :-) I do not blame GLibC here, I describe
what must be done...

When it "left the innocent state" ??? I always was sure that there are is
well-defined migration strategy: broke things in experimental branch and
make sure all needed programs will be updated...
Concerning HZ: what are those sysctls ? How many programs use them ?
