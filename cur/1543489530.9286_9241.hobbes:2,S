Personally, i think that Linus has a strong argument here.
More importantly, lets wait until merced's specs
are released before arguing about how one might use hardware
to solve the problem. 
Most importantly, I've a funny feeling that doing
any of this in the kernel will be a lose, and it likely
will be far better/smarter to implement any "weird compatibility"
things into either libc, or some 'lib-bigendiancompat"
rather than putting yet another piece of complexity into the kernel.
