But the terminating '\0' is required in ELF, no? Or are you going to drop
the name to "LINU" and put the required character in?
In modern size machines I think the limit is way too low, but it is a
standard. I'm sure some code will rely on the NUL and run off the end of
the Earth looking for it, so you can't just leave it off.
