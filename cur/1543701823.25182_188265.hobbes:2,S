Ehh, it will actually happen.
If nothing else, things like SATA will end up meaning that the device you 
were used to seeign as /dev/hdc will suddenly show up as /dev/scd0 
instead. Just because you changed the cabling while you upgraded to a 
newer version of your CD-ROM drive.
And the thing is, with fs labels and udev, even "existing systems" really
shouldn't much care.
Now, we'd probably not want to force the switch, but I do suspect we'll 
have exactly this as a switch in the "Kernel Debugging Config" section. 
Where even _common_ things like disks could end up with per-bootup values. 
Just to verify that every part of the system ends up having it right.
Think of it this way: RedHat not that long ago decided to break with a
_lot_ of tradition by switching over to UTF-8 as the common text encoring.  
It broke some _major_ programs in how they dealt with "simple" things like
keyboard input that had worked for literally _decades_.
And you could switch it off if you really wanted to, but quite frankly, it 
wasn't even a simple choice in the install. You had to know what you were 
doing to switch it off.
And the thing is, that is _the_ single thing that cleaned up a lot of 
remaining problems wrt UTF-8 on Linux. Yes, almost all of them had been 
solved already, or RH wouldn't have dared do the switch. But to get there 
all the way, you had to literally force the cut-over.
(Yeah, I'm a bad person, and I personally went back to the C locale,
because "pine" still doesn't get UTF-8 right, and nobody is apparently
ever going to fix it. Oh, well. But at least I know I'm doing something
_wrong_, which in itself is a good thing.).
