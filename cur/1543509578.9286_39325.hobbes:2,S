    My dual Pentium III system is up and running linux smp-kernel 2.2.3. The
    motherboard used is an ASUS P2B-DF.  Trying to set the BIOS clock via
    the /sbin/clock or the /sbin/hwclock commands fail.
What version of hwclock? Have you tried the --directisa option?
Going via the kernel rtc has certain problems that are often avoided
by accessing the hardware directly.
