Con,
    I did not mention before, I thought it was a fluke on my system. Now 
its affecting two systems since applying ck7.
<snip>
hda: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete 
DataRequest }ide: failed opcode was 100
hda: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete 
DataRequest }ide: failed opcode was 100
hda: CHECK for good STATUS
<snip>
That is happening while applying the dma settings to the hard drive.
In both cases, the drive is a Western Digital 40GB hard drive.  That is 
the only solid commoniality.  One is a P4 2.8, the other a P4 2.4.   
Intel Chipset + Intel IDE in one, Intel Chipset + HighPoint chipset in 
the other. 
However, the code is exactly the same.
Thanks,
  Joshua
