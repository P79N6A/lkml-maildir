I'm not sure where that standard would be defined, but wouldn't
it be applicable in the "version" section?
i.e. in utsname, version could also contain the compiler information.
I also notice that sys/utsname.h references a POSIX standard:
POSIX Standard: 4.4 System Identification       <sys/utsname.h>
Since I do not have access to a copy of the POSIX standard that
I know of, I don't know what that standard specifies exactly.
Comments?  Does anybody know?
Tim
