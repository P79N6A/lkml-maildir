    This is true, unless you compiled the GNU libc library on your favorite
UNIX system.  As most of the unix utilities packaged with commercial unixes
basically suck (as compared to their GNU cousins) I already compile all the
GNU utilities (anf compilers, etc) whenever possible on whatever system that
I am working on; so compiling the GNU C library isn't much of a problem.  Or
you could just make a wrapper function "myread" that does the necesary error
handling on the non-GNU-like systems.  The real problem is that having
system calls fail with an error that actually means, "call me again," is not
intuitive and leads to having to added unnecesarily complicated code such
as.
prereadlabel:
if((bytesread = read(...)) == -1)
{
    if(errno == EINTR) goto prereadlabel;
    // fatal read error handling code
}
    I dislike having to use a goto but its the cleanest method I've scene
that takes care of this problem.  The only other code that comes close to
the above in cleaness, is actually more ambiguous; especially to the casual
programmer or when quickly scanning code.
while((bytesread = read(...)) == -1)
{
    if(errno != EINTR)
    {
        // fatal read error handling code
        // must end with either a break or a function return
    }
}
    Hopefully that all-unix (& unix-like) conference will decide to adopt
the GNU way of doing things, at least in the area of system calls.  Leave
the more complicated code for the less common cases when the programmer
actually wants his system call interrupted by a signal.  Or better yet add a
function that lets the programmer turn this behavior on and off per signal.

    I'm not sure about having to design the system to be fundementally async
in order to implement the above.  It may be doable as it currently is by
default with only the addition of a comparision that checks to see if the
driver (or other kernel code) has been set to async mode by the process
which has control over it and branching off of the default if it has been.

    I agree with the above, although an alternative event based API could
probably be made that coexists with the current systems calls.  In this way
Linux could have a new event based API for I/O and still remain backwardly
compatable with UNIX in general.
