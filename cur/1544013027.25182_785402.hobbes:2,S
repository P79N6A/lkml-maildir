This patch series cleans up the kerneldoc for the regulator API and adds
a brief DocBook manual for it, based heavily on the existing plain text
documentation but much less complete.  I'm not sure that the manual
itself is actually worthwhile, the main benefit from it is the generated 
documentation rather than the text in the manual itself - I did the work
to help with generating the earlier fixes.
It may be worth considering the first four patches for 2.6.29 as fixes,
though it's questionable.
The following changes since commit b6fe1c783638104350147877f5823d8faa68f6a2:
