hello,
i downloaded latest kernel 2.6.19.2 and installed it and it works fine.
Now i am trying to install vmware and it asks the location of the
directory of the C header files.
So i pointed it to my download/install directory 
/data/kernel/2.6.19.2/linux-2.6.19.2/include/
and i get the error that the directory of kernel headers does not match
my running kernel ??
what am i doing wrong ?
do i need to download something else ?
thnx
Phil.
