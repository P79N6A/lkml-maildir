I guess you missed this then:
/**
  * atomic_dec_and_test - decrement and test
  * @v: pointer of type atomic_t
  *
  * Atomically decrements @v by 1 and
  * returns true if the result is 0, or false for all other
  * cases.  Note that the guaranteed
  * useful range of an atomic_t is only 24 bits.
  */
There is also atomic_dec_and_lock():
/*
  * This is an architecture-neutral, but slow,
  * implementation of the notion of "decrement
  * a reference count, and return locked if it
  * decremented to zero".
  *
  * NOTE NOTE NOTE! This is _not_ equivalent to
  *
  *      if (atomic_dec_and_test(&atomic)) {
  *              spin_lock(&lock);
  *              return 1;
  *      }
  *      return 0;
  *
  * because the spin-lock and the decrement must be
  * "atomic".
  *
  * This slow version gets the spinlock unconditionally,
  * and releases it if it isn't needed. Architectures
  * are encouraged to come up with better approaches,
  * this is trivially done efficiently using a load-locked
  * store-conditional approach, for example.
