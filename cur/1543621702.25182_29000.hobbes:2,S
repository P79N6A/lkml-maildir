Create a user-space app that will ioctl into your driver and wait for 
requests. When your module needs to call the other module it delivers request 
to the user-space app wich in turn calls the other module and returns results 
via another ioctl call.
Take care not to deadlock.. In user space app use fork() or threads and 
handle module requests async...
Be ready to handle an event when your user-space app unexpectedly dies.
