I have a 486, bios (as i remember) does not even see the disk.

All I can say is that I have a /boot partition of about 64 Megs, because 
I have / formated as reiser so /boot is ext2 because it's from the time 
that you cannot boot from reiser without notail.

Well, it works for me, and as I have said, I have a 486, I'm not sure if 
the bios supports this size, but I seem to remember that it even does 
not detect it at boot, or perhaps it detects it as a strange size such 
as 8Gb or 32Gb, just don't remember.
Linux boots and works for me with no problem in this system.
