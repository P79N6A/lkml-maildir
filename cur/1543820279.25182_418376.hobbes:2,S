Ketchup 0.9.7 is available at:
 
http://selenic.com/ketchup/
The latest version includes several important bugfixes including a
safety check that avoids accidentally unpacking entire kernels in
directories that aren't empty.
Ketchup is an extremely handy tool for doing various things with
kernels. For example:
$ ketchup -s 2.6            # find the latest kernel version
2.6.16.9
$ ketchup -d linux 2.6      # install it
Creating target directory linux
None -> 2.6.16.9

2.6.16.9 -> 2.6.17-rc1-mm3

It's also useful for automating tasks, for instance downloading
the latest broken-out -mm patches:
$ wget -c `ketchup -u 2.6-mm | sed "s/.bz2/-broken-out.tar.bz2/"`
(It's also good on fries.)
