Hi Linus,
This patch does:
 a) remove dependency of CONFIG_MICROCODE on CONFIG_DEVS_FS in config.in
    because many users think it is impossible to use microcode driver
    (because devfs is in filesystems section so they have to possess some
    brain to go there and come back to "processor features" - it is better
    to allow it to compile using the standard devfs stubs and then let it
    fail at runtime, next time they will know better and compile devfs)
 b) changes to BFS filesystem to use the second argument of
    mark_buffer_dirty() correctly
 c) typo in ia64/config.in (/dev/kcore -> /proc/kcore)
 d) removed buffer_block type from fs.h as nobody is using it
 e) added check in kernel/signal.c to panic if signal_queue SLAB cache
    cannot be created
 f) removed local variable 'dentry' from do_generic_file_read() and
    filemap_nopage() as it is not needed (only 'inode' is needed)
Please consider it.
Regards,
