Subject: [PATCH] graceful out of memory handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
I've been using Rik van Riel's OOM patch for quite a time, and kept it up
to date with the 2.3.x kernels. I added a /proc/sys/vm entry to configure
it (out-of-memory-kill: limit-to-kill limit-to-term, in percentage of
overall free memory). I also moved whatever possible into
linux/mm/oom_kill.c to keep the impact of other changes as little as
possible (mostly to reducy my work when the kernel changes again). Other
parts of the kernel can make use of the functions to select a process to
kill (e.g. under hard OOM conditions). I didn't put in that, it's
sufficient to let kswapd do the work.
I must say I need it. My programs go wild too often. This patch selects
the worst offender and kills it. There are two limits: one to send a
SIGTERM, one to send a SIGKILL. So far, it hasn't caused any false kills
with me. I tried to live without it, and the rest of OOM handling in the
kernel just doesn't do it. An OOM situation without this patch still
results too in a machine that needs a hard reset.
If you don't like it, switch it off with
echo 0 0 >/proc/sys/vm/out-of-memory-kill
as root.
