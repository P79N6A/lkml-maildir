The ( evntually ) new syscall do not have to implement anything special
about queue and message delivery, the f_op->poll() support will be
sufficent to have them working with select/poll/epoll. About netlink, I
personally find it quite confusing with respect of simple syscalls like :
int sigfd(...);
int timerfd(...);
Netlink is quite powerfull because of its generic message passing
infrastructure, that is IMHO overkilling when you simply have to receive
one timer/signal event. I personally do not like the idea of multiplexing
APIs, expecially ones that did not born with that purposes.
