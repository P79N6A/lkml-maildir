Can you propose a better interface?
I don't really understand your comment, because the UNIX filesystem has
always been the namespace for operating system objects. Whether the
objects in the namespace live on disk or in memory (/proc) the purpose
of the filesystem has traditionally been to expose kernel level objects
to user space. The filesystem interface provides security and
polymorphism in a consistent package.
If there's one feature missing it's the ability to be notified when an
inode is modified.
So please propose a better interface or explain why my commentary above
is incorrect.
