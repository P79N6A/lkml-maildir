Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.29pre3

Hi. I've updated the patches for 32-bit UID support in Linux to the latest
development kernel version. (pre-patch-2.3.29-3)
The big change is in the SysVIPC stuff: since I had to create new
msqid_ds, semid_ds, and shmid_ds structures to handle 32-bit UIDs, I went
ahead and added more padding for future use (such as 64-bit time_t to
solve the year 2038 bug). Moving the contents of
include/linux/{msg,sem,shm}.h into include/asm-xxx seemed to be the best
way to do this (rather than use architectural ifdefs), so the
per-architecture patches have become bigger.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991123/
Changes in this version:
	- new patch against 2.3.29pre3 kernel
	- tested and working on i386
	- struct msqid_ds, semid_ds, and shmid_ds are now broken out on an
	  architecture-by-architecture basis.
	  New files: include/asm-[arch]/{msg,sem,shm}.h
	- this necessitated making separate patches for alpha, mips, ppc,
	  and sparc64, thereby eliminating linux-other-arch.patch
	- yet more superfluous comments removed
	- system call vectors added for sparc32 (for new system calls),
	  and sunos emulation (hopefully) fixed to call 16-bit UID
	  compatibility functions.
	  Please note that this is all fairy tale code at this point and
	  is absolutely untested. I plan to drag out a Sparc machine in
	  the near future to test this on.
	  Also keep in mind that the actual sparc people have nothing to
	  do with this so please don't bother them if it breaks :) If
	  32-bit UIDs ever become official I'll submit this work to them
	  for their approval...
In order to use 32-bit UIDs you need the following patches from the above
URL:
	linux-acct.patch
	linux-arch-independ.patch
	linux-ext2.patch
	linux-ipc.patch
	linux-filesystems.patch
as well as a patch for your particular architecture:
	linux-alpha.patch
	linux-arm.patch
	linux-i386.patch
	linux-m68k.patch
	linux-mips.patch
	linux-ppc.patch
	linux-sh.patch
	linux-sparc.patch
	linux-sparc64.patch
Known to be broken with these patches:
	- sparc64. It has to emulate sparc32, sunos, and solaris, and it
	  does so using assembly and lots of other stuff that I haven't
	  fully examined yet. And I don't have a spare Ultra either :)
Thanks,
Chris Wing
