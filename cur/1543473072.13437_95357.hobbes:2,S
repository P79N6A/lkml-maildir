Hi Linus.
Addendum to the enclosed message: I forgot to include the relevant
changes to the documentation with it. Here they are, both against the
2.1.132 raw kernel source...
Best wishes from Riley.

I've just downloaded 2.1.132 on this system, and am unpacking it at
the moment...ah, done. let's have a look...OK, try the enclosed...
I've changed the "Both" option to "Any" to make the options differ
from the first letter onwards, and the above appears to work for
"oldconfig", "config" and "menuconfig" - I can't test "xconfig" atm,
so can't comment on that...
Best wishes from Riley.

-PCI BIOS support
-CONFIG_PCI_BIOS
-  If you have enabled PCI bus support above, you probably want to
-  allow Linux to use your PCI BIOS to detect the PCI devices and
-  determine their configuration. Note: some old PCI motherboards have
-  BIOS bugs and may crash if you say Y here -- for such motherboards,
-  you should say N here and say Y to "PCI direct access support"
-  instead.
-
-  Except for some special cases (embedded systems with no BIOS), you
-  probably should say Y here.
-
-PCI direct access support
-CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
-  If you don't want to use the PCI BIOS (e.g., because you run some
-  embedded system with no BIOS at all) or Linux says it cannot use
-  your PCI BIOS, you can enable direct PCI hardware here. It might
-  fail if your machine is based on some unusual chipset, but it
-  usually works. If both PCI BIOS and direct PCI access are enabled,
-  the use of BIOS is preferred. If unsure, say Y.
+PCI access support
+CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS
+  If you have enabled PCI bus support above, Linux needs to determine
+  what PCI devices you have, and how they are configured. This setting
+  deals with how Linux should do that.
+
+  Within the kernel, two separate options are used to enable the two
+  possible ways Linux has for determining this. They are as follows:
+
+  CONFIG_PCI_BIOS
+      This says to allow Linux to use your PCI BIOS to detect the PCI
+      devices and determine their configuration. Note that some old
+      PCI motherboards have BIOS bugs and may crash if this mode is
+      selected.
+
+  CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
+      This says that Linux should enable direct hardware support for
+      detecting PCI devices and determining their configuration. It
+      might fail if your machine is based on some unusual chipset,
+      but it usually works.
+
+  This setting is used to determine the valid combinations of the
+  above two options, since at least one of them MUST be selected. The
+  available choices are as follows:
+
+  BIOS    This enables the CONFIG_PCI_BIOS option only.
+  Direct  This enables the CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT option only.
+  Any     This enables both options.
+
+  If you are using Linux on some embedded system with no BIOS, or
+  Linux says it cannot use your BIOS, you should select DIRECT here,
+  otherwise you should probably select ANY here. Select BIOS only if
+  you have an unusual chipset for which DIRECT doesn't work.
 
 PCI quirks
 CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS
   If you have a broken BIOS, it may fail to set up the PCI bus in a
   correct or optimal fashion. Saying Y here will correct that problem.
