I've already started to like the idea, since init is the tool that runs
all the time, not any ACPI or PM daemon, and it seems good to me that the
kernel always knows what to do on an event (signal init and think that it
has been dealt with).
init should provide a "direct" interface that doesn't rely on scripts
being present in certain directories (one less thing that can be broken)
for programs that want to receive these events. From the application
programmer's view this doesn't even make a difference if you have a shlib.
Maybe we should copy the init people? :-)
