and www.armlinux.net.  Linus has already been informed of this situation,
and we came to the conclusion that, at the time, there was no way to
enforce the copyright due to their location in the world.  This may have
changed recently.
Since this is the case, it may be arguable that the users of vLinux from
Vitals are unkowningly breaking the GPL due to the apparant licensing
which Vitals Systems Inc are re-distributing the code to their customers.
