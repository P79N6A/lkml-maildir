Hello Dick!
Come in!
I don't care about what style of assembly it is.  Believe it or not,
this may come as a dramatic revelation to you, but not every single
person on this planet knows X86 assembler of any form.
I am one of the lucky people who doesn't have his brain crambed full
of the intracies of such a language.  Instead I have my brain full of
ARM assembler instead, which is a hell of a lot more readable than
X86 assembler.
Therefore, you quoting bits of X86 assembler to me is meaningless.
