This is caused by either the way you burn it, or the inability of cdrecord
to create a CD which doesn't do this. It's related to read-ahead, but I
don't remember the exact detail. In any case, you *may* be able to get rid
of the problem by using -pad in mkisofs, or in cdrecord.

I would say a known behaviour, but one which is only triggered by certain
CDs. Not all CDs (in my experience) do this.
