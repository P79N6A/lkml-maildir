-test6 BTW, should be the same.  The issue is that older 2.4 doesn't
'detect' 64MB of RAM, it reads that value from data the firmware passes
on (that can be incorrect or non-existant) and what 2.6 does and (newer
2.4 does / will do) is to ask the memory controller how much memory it
thinks that it has (which in someways is more important).
What I'm trying to do is to see if the problem is something in 2.4 or
2.6, as 2.6 correctly detects 128MB on my PReP box.
