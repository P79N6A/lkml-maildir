You're looking for 'ps ax':
       a    show processes of other users too
       x    show processes without controlling terminal
Granted, it depends on your psutils, but i've never seen a BSD ps that
didn't have 'x'. But then, maybe I'm too young -- i have yet to see a BSD4.x
machine :) This isnt a kernel issue though, strictly userspace. I think you
could port SysV ps if you wanted (minus a few features, --possibly.)
Regards,
