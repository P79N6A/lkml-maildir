It is not true. If you use zImage (kernel < 500kB) you should have >700kB
for compressed ramdisk on the same disketque (unless you use 360k/720k
floppies). It is enough.

You still do not need lilo. You can put ramdisk parameters directly into
kernel using rdev.
However I can't imagine ramdisk loading and starting on a machine with only
4MB RAM (eg. 386SX). Question is: mark such hardware as obsolete or keep
Linux hardware requirement as low as possible ...
