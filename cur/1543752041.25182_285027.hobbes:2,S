Like most vendor drivers, this looks ugly full of obfuscating typedef's
and MixedCase. Please make it conform to linux style.
Also, all global's should be static where possible to avoid name space pollution.
Replace volatile with wmb() and rmb() which is probably what you need anyway.
Don't bury volatile inside typedef.s
