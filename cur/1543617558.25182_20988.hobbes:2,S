This patch fixes several bugs and works around known hardware problems 
which conspired to lock up the system randomly.  Its somewhat large, 
therefore available at:
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developer/opensource/linux/patches/tr/lanstreamer-0.5.1.patch.gz
* Interrupt function rearranged
* PCI Configuration changed
* Tx descriptors had to be reduced to 1 (!)
* Send/Receive operations are nearly serialized
Please apply.
Thanks,
Kent <yoder1@us.ibm.com>
