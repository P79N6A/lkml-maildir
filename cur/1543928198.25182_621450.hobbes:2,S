As far as I know, it's on Greg's queue.

They will manifest in the same way as any other use-after-free bug: an 
oops message and either death of the current process or a system hang.
Obviously I'm not aware of any such bugs -- if I were, I'd fix them.  
Greg has expressed concern that some USB serial drivers might have this 
problem.  I'll do what testing I can (not much because I don't have any 
USB serial devices).

I can't think of anything offhand.  Maybe someone else can.
