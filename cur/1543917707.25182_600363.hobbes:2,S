On the other hand, printing this:
        magic number: 0x2710
probably doesn't ring any bells, but if you changed that format to be
	"magic number: %x (%d)",foo,foo
you'll almost certainly sit up and ask "Where the fsck did *that* come from?"
(unless you're a *lot* better at doing hex conversions in your head than I).
Yeah, *usually* pointless, but it has its place sometimes....
