becouse if the ipw isn't compiled as a module then it's initialized (without 
firmware) before the initramfs or initrd is run. if it could be initialized 
later without being a module then it could be initialized as part of the normal 
system

not on my machines.
what does it use for the initramfs?
I don't enable the options in the kernel for initrd, and I don't give it any 
source for an initramfs.

P.S. there was a suggestion yesterday in this thread that I haven't tested yet. 
I plan to test that tonight. if it works then the card can be reinitialized 
after the system boots, still no initrd or initramfs needed.
