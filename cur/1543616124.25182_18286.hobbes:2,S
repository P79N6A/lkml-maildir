"extra schedule points all over the place", that's the -preempt kernel
not the lowlatency kernel! (on yeah, you don't see them in the source
but ask your CPU if it sees them)

this yes, it requires less maintainance, but still you should keep in
mind the details about the spinlocks, things like the checks the VM does
in shrink_cache are needed also with preemptive kernel.

The I/O pipeline is big enough that a few msec before or later in a
submit_bh shouldn't make a difference, the batch logic in the
ll_rw_block layer also try to reduce the reschedule, and last but not
the least if the task is I/O bound preemptive kernel or not won't make
any difference in the submit_bh latency because no task is eating cpu
and latency will be the one of pure schedule call.

I also don't want to devaluate the preemptive kernel approch (the mean
latency it can reach is lower than the one of the lowlat kernel, however
I personally care only about worst case latency and this is why I don't
feel the need of -preempt), but I just wanted to make clear that the
idea that is floating around that preemptive kernel is all goodness is
very far from reality, you get very low mean latency but at a price.
