I observed a situation on a dual xeon where IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH , if on,
would actually cause spurious interrupts. It was odd cause it's suppose
to stop them .. If there was a lot of interrupt traffic on one IRQ , it
would cause interrupt traffic on another IRQ. This would result in
"nobody cared" messages , and the storming IRQ line would get shutdown.
This would only happen in PREEMPT_RT .
