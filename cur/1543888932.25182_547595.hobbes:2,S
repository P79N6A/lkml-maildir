Just another data point: with the flick of CONFIG_SMP, I'm in control of the
hangs/crashes ;-).
Yup, with CONFIG_SMP=n, I'm unable to reproduce the problem. It's quite stable
actually (having completed a dozen kernel compile sessions so far).
I suspected this after seeing spinlock issues on both cores of my CPU in my
earlier report. Just a stab in the dark with some unexpected luck :-).
(Tested on 
http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6
 changeset at 57106:3f42ad5de7cd.
That's the latest hg commit there.)
Thanks
PS: For the record everything except sysrq support is disabled in the kernel
hacking section. Also the CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG is off. Kernel preemption is also
off, after proving it had no influence. Just to keep the test case simple.
