Sure, there are all sorts of things where some tracing can come in
useful. The question is whether it's really something the mainline
kernel should be doing, and if the gung-ho approach is nice or not.

Your list was almost entirely composed of per-driver debug routines.
This is not the same thing as logging trap entry/exits, syscalls etc
etc, on any level, and I'm a bit perplexed that you're making such an
assocation.

This is clearly an exaggeration. And seeing as something like LTT
doesn't (and cannot) tell the "whole story" either, I could throw the
same argument directly back at you. The point is, there comes a point of
no return where usefulness gets outweighed by ugliness. For the very few
cases that such detailed information is really useful, the user can
usually install the needed special-case tools.
In contrast a profiling mechanism that improves on the poor lot that
currently exists (gprof, readprofile) has a truly general utility, and
can hopefully be done without too much ugliness.
The primary reason I want to see something like this is to kill the ugly
code I have to maintain.

Eh ? I didn't say sys_call_table hackery was better. I said the entry.S
thing wasn't much better ...
