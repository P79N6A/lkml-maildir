*Wave*
The zr36120 is such a broken chip... It has one DMA pointer for
the entire field (really two pointers for one frame) it wants
to transfer. No scatter, no gather.

The problem i'm currently running against is the i have to use
kmalloc() with an 2^x order for the amount of pages to alloc.
Unfortuantly I have defined a framebuffer of a maximum size of
about 3.5MB. 896 pages -> thus kmalloc(...,1024) is needed; We
just threw away 128 pages or 512K :(
