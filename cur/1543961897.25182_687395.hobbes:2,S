The problem I see with both -mm and linux-next is that they tend to be 
better at finding the "physical conflict" kind of issues (ie the merge 
itself fails) than the "code looks ok but doesn't actually work" kind of 
issue.
Why?
The tester base is simply too small.
Now, if *that* could be improved, that would be wonderful, but I'm not 
seeing it as very likely.
I think we have fairly good penetration these days with the regular -git 
tree, but I think that one is quite frankly a *lot* less scary than -mm or 
-next are, and there it has been an absolutely huge boon to get the kernel 
into the Fedora test-builds etc (and I _think_ Ubuntu and SuSE also 
started something like that).
So I'm very pessimistic about getting a lot of test coverage before -rc1.
Maybe too pessimistic, who knows?
