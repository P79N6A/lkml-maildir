#3 is easy to do, but raises other questions. Notably it needs to wake
something up not play with the cache from an interrupt, at least by
my reading of the code.
(See include/linux/timer.h) - init_timer/add_timer/del_timer.
net/appletalk/aarp.c has a good example of playing with timers 
(aarp_proto_init etc)
