Personally, I prefer to have /tmp as a separate partition, with
both /usr/tmp and /var/tmp as symlinks to it. That also has the
advantage that /tmp is valid before the /tmp partition is mounted,
so can be used right from boot-up, which it can't if one does that
the other way round...
Best wishes from Riley.
