Hi Andrea,
The VM fixes perform rather well in my testing
(thanks!), but I noticed a couple of glitches that the
attached patch addresses.
1. max_scan is never decremented in shrink_cache().  I
am assuming this is a typo.
2. The second part of the patch makes sure that
inode/dentry caches are shrunk at least once every 5
secs.  On a machine with a heavy inode stat/directory
lookup load (e.g. NFS server), most of the memory
winds up sitting idle in unused inodes/dentry.  The
present code only reclaims these when a swap_out()
happens or shrink_caches() fails.  This can take a
while on a machine will very few mapped pages such as
an NFS server.
Thanks,
Shantanu
