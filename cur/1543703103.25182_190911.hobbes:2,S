What do you mean for throw out data? If you mean writing DONTNEED'ed 
dirty pages to the backed up file and release them to the page cache, it 
does. If you mean stop handling page faults inside the DONTNEED'ed region, 
it does not. If you mean zero-filling (ala ftruncate()) the DONTNEED'ed 
region, it obviously does not. I thought your goal was to release memory 
to the host, that's why I proposed sys_madvise(MADV_DONTNEED).
