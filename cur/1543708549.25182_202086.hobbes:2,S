Dear Jeff,

"Issue #4:  Need to have the most recent fixes posted to lkml, for stable
operation and full performance (where possible)." suppose to fix this?

Also, for ICH5, "Issue #2:  Excessive interrupts are seen in some
configurations."
Is there any fix? W'll I get problems if I use 2 x PATA + 2 x SATA drives
with ICH5 in enhanced mode?
Thanks.
