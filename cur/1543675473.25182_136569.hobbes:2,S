It is not the same thing, I think that you
agree on that, too.

In my opinion, you have to do something about
the issue, because it is a bug, it is not
a missing feature. But this is just my opinion,
you are the maintainer, you take decisions.

'Find them yourself', nice answer ;-(
It is a pity read this kind of comment,
I still don't understand the reasons 
of this duplications of code and the reason
of this kind of silly sarcastic remarks.

Again, you know there is a problem but you
don't say anything about it.
You do not want to fix it, don't you ?
This is fine with me (even if it is hard to 
understand the reason), but you are just
/wrong/ when you know about a problem and
don't provide information about it.
Again, this is just my opinion...

Ditto.
Ciao,
