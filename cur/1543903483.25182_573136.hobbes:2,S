Crude and simple way would be to add
config JS_RTC
	tristate "JavaStation RTC"
	depends on SPARC32 && PCI
	<copy help from RTC with s/will be called rtc/will be called js-rtc>
in drivers/char/Kconfig, slap plain and simple !SPARC in RTC dependencies
and put
js-rtc-y = rtc.o
obj-$(JS_RTC) += js-rtc.o
in drivers/char/Makefile
