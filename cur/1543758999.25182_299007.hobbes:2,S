Can you tell us or me what it is that you are trying to do.
I don't want to know how you've coded it, but rather what
you are trying to accomplish even before you start to write
code!
If you tell us what it is that you are trying to accomplish,
then people who know something about the kernel may try
to teach you how do do it.
Also, it doesn't do any good to use another name from another
yahoo account. We all know that they are free and we can
detect when the same kinds of questions and answers are
repeated.
Cheers,
