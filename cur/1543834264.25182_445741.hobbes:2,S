Subject: [PATCH] reference rt-mutex-design in rtmutex.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/21/68

In order to prevent Doc Rot, this patch adds a reference to the design
document for rtmutex.c in rtmutex.c.  So when someone needs to update or
change the design of that file they will know that a document actually
exists that explains the design (helping them change it), as well as
letting them know that they need to update it if it becomes out of date.
