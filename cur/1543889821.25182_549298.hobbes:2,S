Subject: [PATCH 1/2] [CodingStyle] Add comment to not put spaces before tabs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/25/284

Mixed space/tab indentation is wrong. Ironically this is what the coding
style document actually shows ;)
