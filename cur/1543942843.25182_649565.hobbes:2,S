yeah, exactly. You could try into using the "PG_arch_1" struct page 
->flags bit - it's not utilized on x86. That way we could avoid free-ing 
it into the general page pool. We could check for it in 
arch/x86/mm/init_64.c's online_page() function [that's where we release 
most pages into the page pool].
Perhaps it might also be handy to introduce a page_is_fake_ram(addr) 
method that searches the e820 maps for fake ram, to make sure we never 
allocate such ranges.
Such a feature would be very useful.
