It is.  Basically it is the normal kexec interface that allows you to
boot another kernel.  With a few restrictions that should keep it as
reliable as possible when the kernel has not shut itself down cleanly.
The hardest case is to do a useful system core dump.  As that requires
looking at what has gone before.  For the rest if you can do it
with a kernel and a initramfs you are in good shape.
There seems to be a significant amount of interest in the full
system core dump case so that is what the work is concentrating
on.
