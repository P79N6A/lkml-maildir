Beware: netconsole slipped into the patch, and makes 'make xconfig' fail:
...
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
drivers/net/Config.in: 251: can't handle dep_bool/dep_mbool/dep_tristate condition
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.10-bw/scripts'
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
