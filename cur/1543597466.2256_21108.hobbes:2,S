> I have a file that is approximately 3.25GB and my system keeps bitching about "Value too large for defined data type."  Is there any way to stop this?  Since I'm sure you're wondering why I have a file that large, I'm using it via loopback as my MP3 partition, so I can remove it fairly quick if the need should ever arise.
You need a 2.4 kernel and you need to be using NFSv3 to handle files >2Gb
