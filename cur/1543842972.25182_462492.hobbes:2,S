no, it works on 2.4.20. i didn't tried yet with other 2.6.x versions.
btw. now i compiled 2.4.33.3 using gcc 3.4.6 ,
and even though i used 486 in cpu type resulting binary requires
TSC+ from cpu :o (now recompiling with gcc-2.95.3 , and
config_notsc and it seems to boot up)
however weird behaviour aswell, because stops just after init...
no matter wheter i use init=/bin/bash or regular init.
it reports mounting root fs (ext2), then freeing unused kernel
mem (52k) and stops .
when i press keys i see output like it should be , so at least
keyboard work :)
with 2.6.18-rc5 it boots just fine, but ofcourse keyboard is
broken.

with prink enabled it prints series of 'unknown scancode'
and keys are randomly messed up, and it changes, so like pressing b
results with n, then space, then nothing at all.
after some tries keyboard locks up completely.
so wrong keys reported
