Have you tried something like:
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <linux/cdrom.h>
    #include <sys/ioctl.h>
    /* Max it out */
    #define HOWFAST 0
    main(int ac, char ** av) 
    {
      char * device = "/dev/scd0";
      int fd;
      int status;
      fd = open(device, O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
      if (fd < 0) {
	perror("Can't open device: ");
	exit(-2);
      }
      /* `0' means auto-selection, you might also try big numbers :) */
      status=ioctl(fd, CDROM_SELECT_SPEED, 0);
      if (status) {
	perror("Can't set speed: ");
	exit(-1);
      }
    }
Also check out the drive speed field when running
    cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info
and see if it changes when running the setspeed app.
