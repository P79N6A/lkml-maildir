Well, I decided to move all of those to pmif when I had the media
bay broken because ide_unregister calling ide_release_dma which
disposed of the tables behind my back.
Looking at ide.c in it's current incarnation (2.4.20pre), it seems
the common code will only play such tricks if hwif->dma_base is
non-NULL, in which case it assumes a PRD-style DMA.
So if we keep hwif->dma_base to 0, then we can probably go back
to using the hwif fields for sg_* and thus share the routines
with ide-dma.
I'd suggest you don't bother too much with that now. I'm working
with andre on his new IDE stuff in which I already did some
cleanup work on ide-pmac, I'll add that to it next week. That
code should ultimately move to both 2.4 and 2.5 (by 2.4.21 time
frame I beleive).
Ben.
