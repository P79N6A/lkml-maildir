You are looking in the wrong places. What is happening is this
Linux -> Remote		TCP SYN
Remote -> Linux		TCP SYN ACK
Linux -> Remote		TCP "GET /blah HTTP/...."
1:
Remote -> Linux		1500 bytes of data
Slip server -> Remote	"Must fragment"
Firewall of Remote	Dropped
goto 1
If you think this isnt the case get me a set of tcpdumps of the session,
dumping the requesting host, then internet and the host side ports of the
router you claim is buggy.
