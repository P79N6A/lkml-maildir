There were some problems booting with the new aic7xxx driver and 2.4.4
kernel. This may have been fixed in later kernels, so we will check
this again. Besides, I wasn't aware that the new aic7xxx driver uses
a different locking model. Thanks for letting me know.

It is not unreasonable for request IOCB pools to go empty, the important
issue is at what rate ? If a large portion of I/Os have to wait for
request structures to be freed, we may not be able to utilize the available
hardware bandwidth of the system optimally when we need, say, large
# of IOs/Sec. On the other hand, having large number of request structures
available may not necessarily give you large IOs/sec. The thing to look
at would be - how well are we utilizing the queueing capablility
of the hardware given a particular type of workload.
Thanks
Dipankar
