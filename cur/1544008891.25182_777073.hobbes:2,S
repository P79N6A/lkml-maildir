I'm a bit confused because on another system (2.6.26.3) I never see
messages like this despite having the same amount of physical RAM in
each.  The 2.6.26.3 system is also under more active use, and has more
userspace memory usage.  On that system:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
cached Mem:          2017       1681        335          0
99        603 -/+ buffers/cache:        979       1037
Swap:          972        137        835
dpn@colobus:~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
3816
Yet on the system where I saw the allocation failures:
dpn@trout:~/kernels/linux-2.6$ cat /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
5711
If I understand it correctly the issue is that __netdev_alloc_skb must
make a GFP_ATOMIC allocation, which fails because the page cache must
evict pages before there is sufficient memory.  And
min_free_kbytes allows tuning of the point where try_to_free_pages is
called and thus the "reserve" memory available.  Is that correct?
Wouldn't a higher min_free_kbytes mean less likelihood of GFP_ATOMIC
allocations failing?  Or are these allocations failing on my 2.6.26.3
system and I don't know it because of different config options?
Why am I seeing this on the system with the *higher* min_free_kbytes?
Cheers,
Dan
