No idea - it's something that Linux has always done.  Neither do I have
any idea if changing it will break anyones setup.  However, since I don't
maintain serial anymore, I'm not about to start playing about with this
trying to find out.
Feel free to submit a patch to akpm to leave RTS alone when CRTSCTS is
not set.  I'd recommend that it sits in -mm for about 6 months to really
get an idea if it breaks anything.
