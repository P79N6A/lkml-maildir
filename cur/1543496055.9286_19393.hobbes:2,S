I've given up on umsdos boot for MCA in 2.2, but it was handy so I tried
it again with 2.2.9 and I just thought I'd mention that it still doesn't
work. From a floppy to a umsdos partition that is. Haven't tried LILO.
FWIW.
One fun little success recently was I was trying to build a 1.0.9
linux-lite, which I guess is a 1.0.9 modified for ELF, and the build died
on some missing header for .../linux/tools/build. I didn't feel like
chasing that so I put the 2.2.3 ../linux/arch/i386/boot/tools/build in the 
1.0.9 dir and it built. har. Actually, I then realized I needed something
else, so I don't know if it boots, but still mildly amusing.
See ya at Expo.
