Recently the bogomips measurement has gone all haywire.  Every once in a
while when I boot up the bogomips measurement will be absurly high (i.e.
5 Terahertz), with obvious associated problems.  This happens in recent
kernels with both gcc-2.96-81 (redhat) and egcs-2.91.66.  It does not
happen with early 2.4 kernels or 2.2 kernels.  It does not happen all
the time.  It never happens from a cold boot, and (almost) always
happens in a warm reboot.  In particular, MILO (which is a stripped-down
linux 2.0 kernel that loads the real kernel) always measures the
bogomips correctly immediately before loading a new kernel that measures
it incorrectly.
The system is:
Alpha LX164 (21164 chip) at 600MHz
Kernels 2.4.7-2.4.9.
Cheers,
