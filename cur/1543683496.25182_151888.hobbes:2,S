Dunno. Look in the list archives for earlier discussions on the topic. 
It seems AMD audio is a clone of Intel audio, which is why Intel audio 
works for NForce. Since both audio and ethernet match, it seems unlikely 
that Nvidia would license a completely different ethernet chip, but who 
knows?
Anyway, I want to put as much info out there as possible for someone to 
use as they wish. So here's another tip:
00:04.0 Ethernet controller: nVidia Corporation nForce2 Ethernet 
Controller (rev a1)

f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
Note the first row reads:
00: de 10 66 00 07 00 b0 00 a1 00 00 02 00 00 00 00
Before nvnet loads, the same row reads:
00: de 10 66 00 03 00 b0 00 a1 00 00 02 00 00 00 00
Don't know if that is significant.
