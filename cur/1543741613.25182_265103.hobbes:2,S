The sole existence of this discussion prooves that there's already the need of
a new step. But why trying to re-invent the wheel? Yes, relating to 2.6 we need
already a "very stable kernel" and a "not-slowed down development kernel". When
it happened in 2.4 2.5 was created. Isn't all this just the indication that we
need a 2.6 development like 2.4 is, and we need 2.7 to be created?
