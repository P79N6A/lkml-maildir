The usual way is to read all time registers, save those values.
Read all registers again. Do this until the two consecutive reads
return the same values. You never have to busy-wait at all.
When I do this, I put the values read in two arrays, I memcmp()
them and, if not the same use memcpy() to copy new to old and
try again.
