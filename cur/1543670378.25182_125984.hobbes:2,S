If it works for you, great!
It doesn't work at all for some people, and it works until you hit high 
loads, for others.  Besides all the bug reports I've seen, Alan Cox has 
noted it's an open issue as well.  He may have more info on the APIC 
details.
Basically there are a lot of "I boot with 'noapic', and suddenly 
everything works" reports.
