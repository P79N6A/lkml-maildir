|   00000000     0        0 0 2 c4e3f0c0

http://lxr.linux.no/source/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c?v=2.6.8.1#L2504
That line is used/printed if socket state is case TCP_SEQ_STATE_ESTABLISHED:
or case TCP_SEQ_STATE_LISTENING:
(line 2559).  However, if socket state is case TCP_SEQ_STATE_OPENREQ:,
get_openreq4() is called to print the info, and if socket state is
case TCP_SEQ_STATE_TIME_WAIT:, get_timewait4_sock() is called to
print the info.  The first case includes 5 fields after the %p (pointer),
while the 2nd and 3rd cases do not.  Is that the truncation that you
are referring to?

That doesn't quite explain it.

Expect different output formats depending on socket state.
