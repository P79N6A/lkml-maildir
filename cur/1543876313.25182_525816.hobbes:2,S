You need a changelog entry (or explanation of what you're doing). You 
need a signed-off-by line and your patch needs to apply to the root of 
the kernel tree with -p1, something like:
-------------
Replace deprecated pci_find_device call with pci_get_device.

And your subject needs to please include the string "[PATCH]", something 
like:  [PATCH] path/to/file.c: pci_find_device cleanup
However, as pointed out, the code itself is incorrect, for every 
pci_get_device there also needs to be a call to pci_put_device in order 
to maintain reference counts.
Your client does not seem to be clobbering the patch itself and 
maintains tabs and line wrapping (unlike my client).
