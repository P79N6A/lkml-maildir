No, not in the stock kernel.
However, if you look up stuff having to do with IP over SCSI (old) or SCSI
over IP (new), you will find quite a number of the pieces needed for this.

You're not thinking hard enough. Try this: embedded Linux taking whatever
form or number of disks together with software RAID _and_ volume
management / snapshot capability and whatever other intelligence you want
and presenting it to hosts as an arbitrary number of generic SCSI / FC /
iSCSI disks.
