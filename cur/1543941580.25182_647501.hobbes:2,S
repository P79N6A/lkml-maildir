Er...  For unionfs it's a much more monumental problem.  Look - you have
a mapping between the directory trees of layers; everything else is
defined in terms of that mapping ("this files shadows that file", etc.).
If you allow a mix of old and new mappings, you can easily run into the
situations when at some moment X1 covers Y1, X2 covers Y2, X2 is a descendent
of X1 and Y1 is a descendent of Y2.  You *really* don't want to go there -
if nothing else, defining behaviour of copyup in face of that insanity
will be very painful.
What's more, and what makes NFS a bad model, NFS client doesn't lock
directories of NFS server.  unionfs *does* locking of directories in
underlying layers, which means that you have an entirely new set of
constraints - you can deadlock easily.  As the matter of fact, your
current code suffers from that problem - it violates the locking rules
in operations on covered layers.

Ugh...  "Currently unionfs users tend to use it ways that do not trigger
fs corruption" is nice, but doesn't really address the "current unionfs
implementation contains races leadint to fs corruption"...

Different problem.  IIRC, that paper implicitly assumed that mapping between
vnodes in different layers would _not_ be subject to massive surgeries from
operations involved.

Keep in mind that the same directory can be seen elsewhere in the same
namespace (let alone the different ones).  The same fs can be seen in
any number of places...

For ext* and tmpfs it's a matter of trivial kernel patches (I can do the
entire bunch easily) + coordination with Ted to get feature flag for
ext*/teach e2fsck not to throw up on directory entries with type "whiteout".

NFS is more interesting ;-/  There the fallback to your scheme might be the
best available variant, if it can be converted into nfs_whiteout(dir, dentry)
+ modifications to existing methods...
