I may have phrased the question poorly.  I am trying to get at whether the
x86 "lock ; dec $x" operation can somehow be affected by changes to IRQ
affinity, since that is what appears to happen.  I assume SMP inter-cpu
locking doesn't generate IRQs at the linux kernel level (right?), but
there seems to be something at a low level which gets affected by changes
to which CPU handles which IRQs.

Here is the basic repro so far:
-1) SMP x86 machine (PIII or PIV), 4 gigs of RAM, kernel 2.4.26.  Here are 
    some possibly relevant configs:
CONFIG_X86=y
CONFIG_X86_WP_WORKS_OK=y
CONFIG_X86_INVLPG=y
CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG=y
CONFIG_X86_XADD=y
CONFIG_X86_BSWAP=y
CONFIG_X86_POPAD_OK=y
CONFIG_RWSEM_XCHGADD_ALGORITHM=y
CONFIG_X86_HAS_TSC=y
CONFIG_X86_GOOD_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_PGE=y
CONFIG_X86_USE_PPRO_CHECKSUM=y
CONFIG_X86_F00F_WORKS_OK=y
CONFIG_X86_MCE=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
CONFIG_HIGHIO=y
CONFIG_MTRR=y
CONFIG_SMP=y
CONFIG_X86_TSC=y
CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
0) Start irqbalance.
1) Have 10+ gigs of space available for testing preferably on two separate
   filesystems, mounted on say /test_0 and /test_1.
2) As root do a "find /" to fill up the dcache/inode caches with a bunch 
   of data.
3) Compile the attached writer2.c: "gcc -O2 -o writer2 writer2.c"
4) Run "writer2 /test_0 0" and "writer2 /test_1 0" in the background.
5) Run "emerge sync" a few times per day.
6) Wait for crash.
Step 5 is unique to Gentoo, so it would be nice to have another test
program which does the equivalent in terms of opening/created/deleting a
bunch of times.  Intent to be inspiring that a bunch of items are added to
and removed from the inode_unused list regularly.

I have reproduced the same symptoms (inode_unused list corruption) on
2.4.24 with a modified kernel (tux patches plus my filesystem) but I have
not tried to do so with a stock 2.4.24.  So far only stock kernel I have
tried has been 2.4.26.

What I seem to be seeing is that changes in IRQ affinity are at some level
screwing up the guaranteed atomicity of the "lock ; dec $x".  I realize
that might be crazy to think, but maybe it is something known about the
x86 spec.  The two CPU's I have seen this with, by the way, are a PIV-Xeon
(CPUID F29) and a PIII (CPUID 06B1), so I don't imagine a microcode-type
bug unique to a certain CPU release.
