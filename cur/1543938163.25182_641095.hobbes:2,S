Thanks for the suggestion, however I've just tried this kernel, but the 
pthread_cond_wait() behaviour still remains as per 2.6.23 described 
above (i.e. highest prio thread doesnt get woken first).
>>(*) I have no information on whether the futex-plist implemetation was 
>>pulled from the tree to cause your regression.  
I've just had a look at the code from the 2.6.24 kernel and it seems as 
though the futex priority list patch code is still included. 
>>It is possible that the changes between 22 and 23 are just tickling

Or that the changes between 22 and 23 are bringing out another issue 
whereby the desired behaviour of futex-plist is somehow being 
circumvented.
If so, my questions still stand to anyone who might know what has caused 
the change in pthread_cond_wait() behaviour for RT threads between the 
22 and 23 kernels.
Cheers,
Mark
