http://www.sigmadesigns.com/support/download_netstream2000_linux.htm
contains official binary only drivers for the Netstream2000 card which uses 
the em8400 chip.
If you are using the chip to implement your own board then you should 
contact sigma designs for Linux drivers. They say the chip has linux 
support on:
http://www.sigmadesigns.com/products/em8400.htm
As Sigma designs do not release specs nor sourcecode there is no open 
source driver available and I am not aware of any non-official efforts to 
produce drivers.
If you want the em8300 chip then have a look at 
http://dxr3.sf.net/
 where 
you can find the inofficial Linux GPL drivers for the Sigma designs 
Realmagic Hollywood+ and Creative dxr3 cards (which are the same).
HTH,
