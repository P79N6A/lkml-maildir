No.  It is asking whether the NORMAL interruption of this interruptible 
sleep will be caused by a human user action such as a keystroke or mouse 
action.  For the NFS client the answer to that question is unequivically 
no.  It's not a matter of policy it's a matter of fact.

It's not policy.  It's a statement of fact about the nature of the sleep 
that is being undertaken.

TASK_INTERACTIVE is not about policy.

I thought that I said (or at least implied) that.  The difference is 
that we wouldn't be having this conversation.

I wish that I could make you understand that that isn't the case. 
You're not being asked to make a policy decision you're being asked to 
make a statement of fact about whether the interruptible sleep is 
interactive or not.  In the cases involved in this patch this question 
is always "no, it's not an interactive" sleep and it can be answered at 
compile time with absolutely no run time overhead incurred.
