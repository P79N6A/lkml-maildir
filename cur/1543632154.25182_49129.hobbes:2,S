I think a lot of us were not complaining because we thought it was a done deal.
Now what's necessary, do we have to form cheerleading teams and start lobbying
to get what we thought was coming anyway?  It's really not a pleasant feeling
to be put in that position.  Nobody relishes the role of outspoken advocate of
this or that, at least I do not.  I'd *much* rather be hacking.

You've got it backwards.  The function of the maintainers you mentioned is
to *resist* change, not promote it.  In this case, change comes from the top,
and as long as Linus doesn't realize that there really is a lot of demand
for this change, nothing is going to happen.

Now wait, it seems to me that only Keith is being asked to comply with
requirements, and they're tough requirements.  The burden is just not
being shared equally.
