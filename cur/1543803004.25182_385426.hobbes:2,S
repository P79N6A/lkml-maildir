In -mm a patch appeared that took for granted that GCC_VERSION was set.
So it seems that people started to think that GCC_VERSION was part of
the kbuild PAI and realibale. The best way to avoid this confusion was
to kill GCC_VERSION alltogether.
Andrew & I did it in most cases, and Adrian cleaned up parisc and killed
the last instance og GCC_VERSION there.
No functional changes, but a nice cleanup.
