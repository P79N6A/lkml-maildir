This is why I think this is a bad idea.  This adds an extra conditional test
and branch.  In fact, the way you've done it means you have to do the extra
branch whatever[*]; it might be better to have the if-statement you added
return directly.
[*] assuming gcc doesn't manage to be clever enough to omit the second test if
    the first is true.
