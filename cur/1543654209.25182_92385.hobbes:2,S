This demonstrates a very important point - _any_ automatic
configuration program is likely to cause more traffic to this mailing
list, and create more work for users and developers that the current
automatic configuration process:
echo 'My box doesn't boot' | mail linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
The kernel knows nothing about motherboards, cards, etc.  It knows
about chipsets, and nothing else.  By definition, you cannot have a
kernel configurator that works at a higher level than that.
Why don't we introduce a make allworkingmodules config, which compiles
everything as modules, except for the things that are broken as
modules, (for example IDE in the current 2.5.x tree would be compiled
in).
John.
