The rcu_read_lock/unlock is unnecessary because the only caller that
doesn't hold RTNL (bpq_rcv) already takes that lock.  In fact it's
better to take it there since you need to hold the lock for the duration
of the use of the device.

The rcu_dereference should be provided by list_for_each_entry_rcu.
In fact there is a bug in the list_*_rcu macros where the first
element is not put through rcu_dereference.  I'll fix that up.

Agreed.
