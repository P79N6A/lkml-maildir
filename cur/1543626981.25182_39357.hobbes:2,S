Hi,
 what (which config option) could be the reason for a reboot hang on a
S2462 (2x1900MP, 2GB, BIOS 2.09) between POST/BIOS and LILO?
 The situation is that I have kernels. One of them hangs said system(s)
reproducible when doing a reboot, that other works fine. When the
systems "hang", they hang before LILO gets started. Just a white block
cursor on the left-upper corner of the screen.
 On cold start or on pressing the reset button both kernels boot fine.
Any ideas? The working  kernel is 2.4.17SMP as shipped by
FujitsuSiemens/Redhat. The bad one is 2.4.18-ac3+trondsNFSstuff. The
config files are not identical. Thats why I ask which of the options
could cause the effect.
TIA
Martin
