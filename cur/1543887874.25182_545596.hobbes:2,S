Not necessarily, we have this fault injection system that can fail
allocations; that doesn't bring the processes down, now does it?

Those that have __GFP_WAIT set will go to sleep - or do whatever
__GFP_WAIT allocations do best; the other allocations must handle
failure anyway. (even __GFP_WAIT allocations must handle failure for
that matter)
I'm really not seeing why you're making such a fuzz about it; normally
when you push the system this hard we're failing allocations left right
and center too. Its just that the block IO path has some mempools which
allow it to write out some (swap) pages and slowly get back to sanity.
This really is not much different; the system is in dire need for
memory; those allocations that cannot sleep will fail, simple.
All I'm wanting to do is limit the reserve to PF_MEMALLOC processes;
those that are in charge of cleaning memory; not every other random
process that just wants to do its thing - that doesn't seem like a weird
thing to do at all.
