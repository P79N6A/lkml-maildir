Hi all!
Found a buglet in tcp <-> ipv6 binding glue today. Problem manifests
itself when you try to connect to ::0 when you've got no interfaces
up (does oops). Present in at least 2.2.7, 2.2.9, 2.3.2, 2.3.3
(verified). The bug is in tcp_v6_connect. This fixes it:
(obvious when you're staring at it....)

Strange noone spotted this before. But who is silly enough to try to
connect to ::0 with no interfaces up?? Me :-)
