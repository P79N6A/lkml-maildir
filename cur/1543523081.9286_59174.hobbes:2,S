Its very hard to do so. The only people who did it were the Linux 8086 folks.

We can address that when it occurs, in fact they can address it. Writing
poorer systems now just "in case" is a bad choice. Its one of the big
differences between "software engineering" and how free software evolves.
Software engineering generates complex and very complete reusable objects.
Free software generates simple, incomplete objects that do what is actually
currently needed and can be extended later
