It's not a new bug, we've always had this bug in 2.4.x
There is so much code that does atomic bit ops asynchronously on
page->flags that it is therefore not safe for any context to make
non-atomic changes to the values there.
The patch Rik posted is the safest solution to this bug.  If you
want to make it faster by creating a "mutliple bit" set of bitops
go right ahead, but be nice enough to make sure every single architecture
has an implementation before suggesting that the change gets merged
into 2.4.x
