You have to add  -driver=mmc_dvdplusr , because the Dual Layer discs are 
not yet in the ProDVD database as it seems.

Security-critical environments like data centers either have a Windows 
NT-style machine providing <enter whacky burning software here>, or they 
've got a specialized machine that is marked "use for cd burning - note 
security implications". Usually there is no problem with that as in that 
case, you should remove your ISO you copied over for writing after writing.

userwhat? You mean supplemental groups as printed by id(1)? I find them 
ugly, because it's a real hassle to manage it with files.
In the past, NGROUPS_MAX also was 32, being more of a limit than today.
