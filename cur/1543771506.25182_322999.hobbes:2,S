On  a DC+HT, x86_num_cores will be 2 and kernel will set smp_num_siblings 
to 2 (even though number of logical processors per physical package as
seen by cpuid.1.EBX.bits[23:16] will be 4).
Remember, smp_num_siblings in kernel will just represent HT logical siblings.
If CPU is just DC capable, cpuid.1.EBX.bits[23:16] will return '2' and
number of cores computation from cpuid.4.EAX.bits[31:26] will be 2. 
And kernel will set x86_num_cores to 2 and smp_num_siblings will be set to 1
If CPU is just HT capable,cpuid.1.EBX.bits[23:16] will return '2' and
number of cores computation from cpuid.4.EAX.bits[31:26] will be 1.
And kernel will set x86_num_cores to 1 and smp_num_siblings will be set to 2.

If CPU is DC+HT capable, but HT is disabled in bios, cpuid.1.EBX.bits[23:16] 
will still be 4 and during bootup, kernel will figure out that no HT
siblings came up and will reset smp_num_siblings to 1.
I am planning to do more cleanup post 2.6.12, so that smp_num_siblings will
be moved to per cpuinfo.
