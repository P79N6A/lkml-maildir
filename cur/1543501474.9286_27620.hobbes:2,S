Won't help, usleep(3) uses nanosleep(2) which uses the 1/HZ (10ms) timers
under the normal scheduling type. Check the manpage on nanosleep(2).
If you set the scheduler to SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO nanosleep(2) does up 
to 2ms busy waits (finegrained sleep) and then switches back to the standard
10ms timer.
