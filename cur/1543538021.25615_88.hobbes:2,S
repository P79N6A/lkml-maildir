Hello Marc + Everybody else following
Just a short update for regarding my problem...
I have low - level formatted my drive and the problem still exists. Any
ideas.... I am sure Windows 2000 did something bad to my drive (changed
something in the drive flash rom or similar..) 
But nobody so far gave me a solution for the problem. The drive works
perfectly in Win98 + Win 2000 + Bios but the Adaptec 2940 using the
Linux drivers does not see it.
