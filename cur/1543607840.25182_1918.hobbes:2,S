Yes it's very repeatable.  In fact, running as above demonstrates it even
better here because all of the file data ends up in the cache.  So there
are no reads to confuse things.  Basically, to save space - it's the same,
with the writes degenerating from 5000 a second to a couple
hundred.  During this time (the stalls) no process is using any CPU time
and only 'cvs' is in D state, according to ps.
Here's another detail, running 'sync' takes about 20 to 30 seconds during
these stalls, and I *think* cvs issues a 'sync' when it finishes the tag,
because it stalls in an even more pronounced way exactly at the end of the
tag (or un-tag).
