 Well, you could have a look at the few options at the top of
<asm-mips/io.h>, but on second thoughts, as long as port I/O string
operations either use an unswapping address space or revert any swapping
that might have been done by hardware (either for data or for addresses),
they should work as is.  Unlike with memory-mapped I/O that should be
feasible, because port I/O is specific to ISA/EISA/PCI which are always
little-endian.
 Anyway, I still think the patch should go in for consistency.

 I can have a look at it -- that is as trivial as copying missing
definitions from <asm-generic/ide_iops.h>.  I'm afraid I won't even be
able to perform compilation tests, though.
