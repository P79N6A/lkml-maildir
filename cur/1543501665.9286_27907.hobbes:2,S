I've converted the drivers to use the syncppp.c for ppp and hdlc several
weeks ago (there was a separate hdlc implementation and ppp needed an
external, modified pppd). The fr code is separate, and there is one
more protocol supported: lapb using the internal kernel lapb stack.

The comx cards use an interface like this, only there is no command file,
it's done with ifconfig.

I don't think proc fs support is such an overhead, I've never considered
making a router without /proc support. Of course there might be security
issues....

I have some exams this week, but from next week I'll have much more time.
