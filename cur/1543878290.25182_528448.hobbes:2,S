Nope, if they are accurate and they have something to do with your
particular usage and applications, then they are relevant.  But it
requires both to make them relevant.  Although it may be possible for a
benchmark to be relevant even if not particularly accurate.

Only if you think disk space is so valuable that trading cpu time to
compress and decompress the data is a good trade off.  It is not one I
would want to make.  So you saved 3GB, what is that?  About $1 worth?
maybe $2 if you have raid.  How much extra time and cpu will it take to
access the data that way?  How much extra electricity will the cpu use?
What is your time worth?  There are so many variables.  Do you _trust_
reiserfs4 to not loose your data any more or less than some other
filesystem?
