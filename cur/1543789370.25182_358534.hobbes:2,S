i have released the 2.6.14-rc4-rt7 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the biggest change is the merging of "ktimers next step", a'ka the 
clockevents framework, from Thomas Gleixner. This is mostly a design 
cleanup of the existing timekeeping, timer and HRT codebase. One 
user-visible aspect is that the PIT timer is now available as a hres 
source too - APIC-less systems will find this useful.
otherwise, there are lots of fixes all across the spectrum.
Changes since 2.6.14-rc4-rt1:
- clockevents framework (Thomas Gleixner)
- ktimer and HRT updates (Thomas Gleixner)
- robust futex updates (David Singleton)
- symbol export fixes (Steven Rostedt)
- export tsc_c3_compensate for real (reported by Rui Nuno Capela)
- fix for the nanosleep() -ERESTARTBLOCK bug
  (reported by Fernando Lopez-Lezcano)
- x64 latency tracer fixes (reported by Mark Knecht)
- PRINTK_IGNORE_LOGLEVEL bugfix
- various build fixes
to build a 2.6.14-rc4-rt7 tree, the following patches should be applied:
