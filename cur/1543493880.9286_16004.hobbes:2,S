My money is on it _not_ being a virus, given the number of partition table
sectors (and disks generally) world-wide which will go belly-up today like
any other day.  Out of 2x10**8 PCs, I'd expect something like 1x10**5 to
have a serious disk problem on any given day, by the time you combine HD
MTBF and good old-fashioned bugs.  And of course, people screwing up with
FDISK and blaming a virus when their boss asks why they haven't got any work
done.
One way to make a backup of your partition table sector (MBR) for next time
:-) would appear to be:
  dd if=/dev/hda of=/floppy/savembr bs=512 count=1
[off-topic] I wrote a DOS version of this, too, as part of my free DOS
anti-virus stuff I did about 6 years ago (when DOS viruses such as Stoned,
Form, etc were the main problem).  It saves the MBR and the active boot
sector in a magic file, so you can later restore them, or compare them
against the current live versions to detect viruses, etc.  About twice a
year I would undo somebody's FDISKing, to their total amazement.
