I've only given it a quick look, it looks pretty good, but too hastily
thrown together, without understanding of the intervening changes:

No, you need to pay attention to Nick's PageReserved removal, and
my pte lock stuff, throughout do_wp_page - there shouldn't be any
references to PageReserved or page_table_lock there now (and you'll
need to recheck the mapping/locking/unlocking/unmapping).  Sorry,
I don't have the time to spare to do it myself right now.

No, don't add VM_FAULT_WRITE in this case: you should only do that
when you've gone through the maybe_mkwrite yourself; this case
should remain the default VM_FAULT_MINOR.

This isn't necessarily wrong, and may be exactly how it was before,
I don't remember.  But it implies that when page_mkwrite fails,
it page_cache_releases the page.  Is that desirable?  Or should
that be left to the caller?

Drop all those changes to do_file_page (which I added), they're no
longer necessary.  A case appeared which made it clear that we cannot
rely on resolving this issue for get_user_pages in a single call to
handle_mm_fault, and that's why the VM_FAULT_WRITE stuff got added. 
This complication of do_file_page was always ugly, and I'm delighted
to drop it.  Whereas the call to do_wp_page from do_swap_page is less
obtrusive and may still be a worthwhile optimization, though I added
it for the same disgraced reason a year or more back.
