I have something different with ppp on 2.4.0-test10. I very often get
the ppp link up, I can ping the ISP end of the connection, but nothing
else. All the pppd messages look just fine coming up.
I called the ISP tech support and they say my connection is not showing
as active on their end. Then again Telstra (the Australian telco people)
have sold their soul to the devil and when you say you use Linux (or
anything non MS windows) they go very unhelpful reciting their mantra
"we only support windows" to everything I say.
