I am happy to report that I finally got a 2.4.x kernel booted and running.
To get the kernel booting without an oops, I had to use the kernel option
"mem=64M" (I have 64 megabytes of ram installed). Aparently, without this
option the kernel was detecting an absurdly large amount of installed
memory, and thus dereferenced a null pointer. Should i help find out how to
get the kernel to recognize the proper amount of memory in my computer
without the kernel option?  What information should i make available? I am
new to actual linux development, and do not know if this is something i
should help fix or if it is just something that requires the kernel option.
regards to the kernel-hackers,
