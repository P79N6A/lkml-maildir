Well, in solutions I ship to customers I need to use some proxy-arp features.
I don't want to turn on proxy arp on an interface basis, because subtle
mistakes in network configuration with proxy arp turned on may have serious
consequences, including arp storm (sic!), and people, especially those called
customers, do make mistakes.
So far, the solution has been to manually create proxy arp entries, that are
known to be safe.
Are you opposing the idea of proxy arp entries being created not by an
automatic discovery (arp on other interface)?
Or you just want to cripple `ip'? :-)
