Subject: [PATCH 2.6.13 0/4] Cleanup - remove unnecessary handle_IRQ_event() prototype
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
I think the function prototypes for handle_IRQ_event() in
include/asm-{mips,ppc,sh,x86_64}/irq.h are no longer needed because
these architectures are using GENERIC_HARDIRQ. This series of patches
removes those unnecessary handle_IRQ_event() prototypes.
NOTE: Since I don't have these architectures, these patches are not
tested yet. I hope these patches will be tested by someone who has
these architectures.
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
