Depends on what you consider usable.  I thought X worked pretty well
in swapless 8MB last time I tried it, (last year, around 2.5.40).
Admittedly that was only running a few xterms locally.  A 4MB + 20MB
swap box was suprisingly usable for fairly intense remote applications
over a compressed 9600 bps serial link.
