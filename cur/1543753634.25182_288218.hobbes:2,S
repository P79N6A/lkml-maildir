I suggest reversing the sense of the macros, and having read_can_lock()
and write_can_lock()
Meaning:
	read_can_lock() --- a read_lock() would have succeeded
	write_can_lock() --- a write_lock() would have succeeded.
IA64 implementation:
#define read_can_lock(x)  (*(volatile int *)x >= 0)
#define write_can_lock(x) (*(volatile int *)x == 0)
Then use them as
     !read_can_lock(x)
where you want the old semantics.  The compiler ought to be smart
enough to optimise the boolean ops.
