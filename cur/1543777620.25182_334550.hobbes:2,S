Yes, It can be removed.

-	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
-	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
-	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
-	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
-	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.
-
-	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
-	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
-	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
-	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
-	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
-	  only way to use the graphics hardware.
-
-	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
-	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.
-
-	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
-	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
-	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at <
http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>

-
-	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
-	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
-	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
-	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
-	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.
