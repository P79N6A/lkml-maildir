Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 11, 2005 at 10:40:00AM CEST, I got a letter
where Florian Weimer <fw@deneb.enyo.de> told me that...

Hmm, what would be actually the point in introducing further
restrictions? Anyone who then wants to get around them will just
distribute the software with the "any later version" provision under
GPLv2, and GPLv3 will have no impact expect for new software with "v3 or
any later version" provision. What am I missing?
I've been doing a lot of LKML catching up, and I remember someone
suggesting using GPLv2 (for kernel, but should apply to git too), with a
provision to let someone trusted (Linus) decide when GPLv3 is out
whether you can use GPLv3 for the kernel too. Does it make sense? And is
it even legally doable without sending signed written documents to
Linus' tropical hacienda?

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
