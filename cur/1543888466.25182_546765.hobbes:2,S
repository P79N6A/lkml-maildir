Hello Tejun,
Thanks for your answers.

Ah, it fixes that "weird noise on shutdown" problem? Fair enough.

Don't controllers support spread spin up of disks, to avoid the peak load?
I think I saw something about that in the SiI 3512 spec I downloaded. So
maybe something like a special spin up method which can be implemented
by drivers, and if it isn't, the current start stop thing is used?

What I meant is that the deadline isn't effective because if it can't be done within
that time, it's just retried after 10 seconds or whatever, basically rendering the
deadline useless. But now I understand that the retry is done in the background,
and that it was just the sd_resume that caused everything to wait on it.

True.

Bugger. So it seems like a good idea to do the reset and spinup async together.

The whole resetting, or just the retry after 10 seconds? But it becomes clear now that
you're right that the spinup problem is solved if sd_resume does background spin up.

Thanks for the pointer, I'll fiddle with it. What do you mean with "proper" here?
Not at all, or in a forced way because power goes away?
(And what does the 'allow_restart' option do?)

Well, manage_start_stop could be split up into manage_start and manage_stop,
but I don't know how useful that is in practice. Maybe it makes more sense to
check /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode and then decide whether to start the disk.
Or just remember the disk state and restore that?
My impression is that these options aren't that useful other than for debugging,
but that normally the right thing should be done automatically. (Not spinning
down at reboot, not spinning up at bootup if the disk isn't used, not spinning up
after resume if the disk wasn't spinning before suspend, etc.)
Perhaps a silly question, but how can you ever set manage_start_stop to 0 before
the disk is started at bootup? You can change it before doing suspend, but not at
bootup. So is this option at the right place?
Greetings,
Indan
