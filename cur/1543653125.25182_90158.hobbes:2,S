I wrote that part of smptimers to run the per-CPU lists from per-CPU
tasklets while porting Ingo's code to 2.5 and Ingo just included it.
At that time, it didn't seem necessary to use up a softirq vector 
when it could be easily done using tasklets.
However it should work fine with softirqs too.
Thanks
