Where does this opinion end users would find Bugzilla too difficult come 
from? Many other projects use Bugzilla without big problems.
Is this just plain FUD or based on real reports from end users?
In the latter case, please give pointers to them so that whatever 
problems exist can be fixed.
And different to LKML, you don't run into problems like majordomo 
silently dropping your email because it contains HTML or a vCard.
