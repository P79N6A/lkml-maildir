I reported this ages ago, but noone cared to fix it.
The problem is (a) modpost was changed to reference a SPARC-only
ELF constant, (b) modpost is compiled against the system's C
library headers instead of the kernel's, and (c) older versions
of glibc don't have this constant defined (at least not on x86).
The same bug exists in module-init-tools, btw, and hits e.g. RH62
which I have on a box designated for glibc compat testing.
The patch below works around the problem in the kernel.
