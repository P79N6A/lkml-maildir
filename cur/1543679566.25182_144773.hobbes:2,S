Is there a make option for building from a read-only kernel source,
possibly by doing a pre-pass to create a mess of symlinks?
Something like
	(chdir $readonly_sourceroot && find . -type d ) \
	| xargs -n5 mkdir
	(chdir $readonly_sourceroot && find . -type f ) \
	| xargs -i ln -s $readonly_sourceroot/{} {}
	make
but as a configure option of some kind.
