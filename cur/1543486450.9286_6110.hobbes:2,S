I have also noticed these. They are occuring when I make ls in some
NFS mounted directory on the client, and then remove files on the
server. Perhaps one more ls on the client side is needed to trigger
the message.

I think messages are harmless, but if so, then they are good
candidates for removing, are they?
Please, correct me if I'm wrong.
