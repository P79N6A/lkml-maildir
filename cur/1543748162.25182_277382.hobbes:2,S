I apologize, the version of the qla2xxx driver was obtained from
qlogic's ftp site.  I assumed it was the beta versions being developed
at the qla2xxx sourceforge site as their ftp was referenced for updated
version (which I understand is the ones that get worked into the
kernel?).  I will contact qlogic directly.
