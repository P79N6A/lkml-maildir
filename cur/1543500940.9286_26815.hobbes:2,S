I've notice a problem with 2.2 kernels when using loopback mount devices.
Specifically, when I unmount, the fs is unmounted and removed from the
/proc/mounts listing, but the underlying fs still reports the old mount
point as being busy and the underlying fs can't be unmounted.
ps: I think the loop device itself is busy too.
