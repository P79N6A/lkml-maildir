I already have something like that. It's a modification of how niceness
values are interpreted. It uses a range of 11 niceness values to get
the processor, e.g. when there's a process running at nice=0 then no
proces with nice=11 or higher will get the cpu. On the other hand, if
there's a process running at nice=-11 (eg. timidity or mikmod) then no
'normal' process will get the cpu. Processes started just with nice
will still get a little bit of the cpu as usual (that's why the
range is 11 and not 10).
I used it on 2.0.36. This is a version for 2.2.
