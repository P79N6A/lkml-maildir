Subject: [PATCH] remove unused tsk_thread from asm-offsets_64.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I was looking for where tsk_thread is used in the x86_64 code, and
couln't find it anywhere. I took it out and compiled the kernel, and it
compiled fine.
So this patch simply removes the "thread" from asm-offsets.c since I
can't find an owner for it.
