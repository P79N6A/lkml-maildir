A compromise is always better than a stalemate.

I really didn't want to discuss implementation details, but you don't
need to make it like you've described here. You can certainly make it
so devfsd only deletes nodes that are "swappable", or so that it will
never delete nodes, or that it will only delete nodes you indicate.
Ignore implementation details. Once it's in userspace you can do damn
well near anything. Your imagination is the limiting factor.

You could "cat /dev/null > /proc/kcore" and the machine crashes. It's
impossible to make things bulletproof against the root user. So don't
try and do the impossible. Don't treat the -root user- like the idiot
fool who needs their hand held.

Aye, it works beautifully, it's a good compromise.
What matters though is if the anti-devfs people agree.
