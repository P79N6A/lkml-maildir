Good question actually.  I know XFS does passed vmalloc'ed memory down
the block I/O path, but that's as a scatter/gather request.  All non-s/g
request should be contingous I think.
We really need to write down the rules about what memory can be passed
down the block I/O path - XFS for example sends kmalloced memory down
which all the iSCSI implementations don't like at all.
