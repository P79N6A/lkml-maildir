I would like to be CC'ed any answers/comments to my question.
are /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem the socket
Buffer (receive and send respectively) Sizes in the linux kernel.
If yes then how come when I try to set these buffer sizes by using the
SO_RCVBUFF and SO_SNDBUFF variables it automatically multiplies the values
by 2 ????
