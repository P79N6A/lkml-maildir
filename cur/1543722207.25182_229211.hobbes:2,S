The hardware can usually generate an interrupt when the performance counter
under or overflows. oprofile uses this too.

p4 siblings share only a single set of performance counters, so you must
keep them synchronized.

The sched_getaffinity code for that is broken, I'm about to submit
a patch for it.  I haven't looked at that one.

It slows down an important fast path (context switch) 
But it would be better to use some back patching design like kernel hooks
to keep the cost for the common case (no perfctr getting switched) 
low.  If that common case can be kept at a "no checks at all" level
then it's good. That would be best for distribution kernels too.
