No, actually it appears to use Reply-To: in preference to From: if it
exists, apparently that was my (its) problem. Can you change this
error message:

to say something like this:

Your assertion that only From: was used caused me to reverify a couple
of times that none of my outgoing MTAs were rewriting my From:
headers, before I tried subscribing without Reply-To:. I think putting
in the error message a description of exactly what the behavior of
your list server is, along with removing the suggestion of the
possibility that the list might be closed (are any vger lists
closed?), and that the user should wait for the owner to take action,
would be of great help to users who are trying to subscribe and are
indeed *not* clueless. Actually, I'm not an expert in mailing list
logic, but I also don't see any reason not to let the subscription
address match either From: *or* Reply-To: *or*, say, Sender:, rather
than taking the first header it finds as it seems to do now.
Thanks,
