Hi,
Just like Linux has round robin, FIFO and other
scheduling policies inside the kernel, I would like to
provide a cyclic/clock driven scheduling policy to
linux. Meaning all set of tasks should be able to use
this policy. This should include any Java threads
also. JVM by itslef provides a priority driven policy
to its threads. JVM sits on the kernel. Modification
to JVM is also required to schedule threads
cyclically. But first I am trying to get this working
with the kernel and then later with JVM.
If you need any more information, I will be glad to
provide them.
I would like to direct you to a website of a course
offered at Cornell university where this assignment is
posted. I want to achieve something similar to this.
Here is the link to that website.

Please Help me.
Thanks,
Linux Quest
