Subject: [PATCH] M386 flush_one_tlb invlpg
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

CONFIG_M386 kernel running on PPro+ processor with X86_FEATURE_PGE may
set _PAGE_GLOBAL bit: then __flush_tlb_one must use invlpg instruction.
The need for this was shown by a recent HyperThreading discussion.
Marc Dietrich reported (LKML 22 Aug) that CONFIG_M386 CONFIG_SMP kernel
on P4 Xeon did not support HT: his dmesg showed acpi_tables_init failed
from bad table data due to unflushed TLB: he confirms patch fixes it.
No tears would be shed if CONFIG_M386 could not support HT, but bad TLB
is trouble.  Same CONFIG_M386 bug affects CONFIG_HIGHMEM's kmap_atomic,
and potentially dmi_scan (now using set_fixmap via bt_ioremap).  Though
it's true that none of these uses really needs _PAGE_GLOBAL bit itself.
I just sent the 2.4.20-pre4 asm-i386/pgtable.h patch to Marcelo:
here's patch against 2.5.31 or current BK: please apply.
