what you do not point out in the changelog, and what i've mentioned to 
you in past replies but you still ignore it: that the patch changes what 
the code does - we now keep PGE enabled in cr4 during the MTRR changing.
the MTRR code is historically fragile, rarely triggered code, laced with 
CPU errata. The change brings us absolutely nothing (it in fact 
increases the code size a bit) and it is just not worth the risk at this 
stage.
