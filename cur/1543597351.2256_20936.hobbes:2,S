Ok, the problem is this.  I have TEQL packet scheduling in my config, 
the kernel runs through this sequence on boot:
net_dev_init()
    pktsched_init()
        teql_init()    [starts a lock with rtnl_lock()]
            register_netdevice()
                net_dev_init()
                    pktsched_init()
                        teql_init() [hangs here...]
Here is the problem.  We enter teql_init() again with a rtnl_lock() 
already being held.  Do any of the authors of these functions want to 
jump in here?
