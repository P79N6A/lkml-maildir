Ahmad, as far as I understood, your spirit is more or less to:
- Drop automagically all the hardware which is for sure NOT here
- Propose to the user to include the hardware which is detected
- Leave as default the rest of the choices
  (i.e. the choices that might be uncertain: fs, protocols, ...)
Therefore, "make autoconfig" is a quick first run through the .config
with the help of all the scripts stored in scripts/autoconfig/.
