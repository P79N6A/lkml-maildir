The interrupt count is definitely high.
WRT the interrupt distribution through, the above is normal.  irq 14 and 
15 are the magic legacy IDE interrupts.  Anything other than 14 and 15 
are (usually) standard shareable PCI interrupts.

Very strange.  My first guess would be that the drivers/ide driver 
appears unfriendly to shared interrupts.  In certain cases the ATA 
protocol does not offer a single, easy "is this interrupt mine?" test; 
the logic has to be implicitly worked into the driver code.  However, 
normally the drivers/ide driver knows what the heck it is doing, so this 
is quite out of the ordinary.
Perhaps you can fiddle with BIOS settings to get ide2 onto an interrupt 
all by itself, and see if the behavior improves.
