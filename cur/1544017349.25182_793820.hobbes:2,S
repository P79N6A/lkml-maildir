Are you sure you are solving the *actual* problem?
The bugzilla entry shows a bisect attempt that leads to a patch
involving negative clock jumps.

with a corrected link to the bisect patch:

Wouldn't a negative clock jump be very influential to the
(time-driven) I/O schedulers and be a more probable cause?
