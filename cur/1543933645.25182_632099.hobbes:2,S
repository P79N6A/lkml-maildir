I didn't recommend the last requeue bit, it looks like a work-around due
to the way that end_request() works. The kerneldoc comment for that
function also tells you NOT to use this in new code. Use
end_dequeued_request() and get rid of the requeue, and streamline 'err'
so you can just pass it directly in.
The locking otherwise looks fine to me.
