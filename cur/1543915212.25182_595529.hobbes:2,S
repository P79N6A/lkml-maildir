No you can't.

You are equating what rights I have with my ability to exercise those
rights. They are not the same thing. For example, I once bought the rights
to publically display the movie "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". To my
surprise, the rights to public display did not include an actual copy of the
film.
In any event, I never claimed that anyone has rights to a protectable
element that they do not possess a lawful copy of. That's a complete
separate issue and one that has nothing to do with what's being discussed
here because these are all cases where you have the work.

Sure, *you* can grant a BSD-style license to any protectable elements *you*
authored. But unless your recpients can obtain a BSD-style license to all
protectable elements in the work from their respective authors, they cannot
modify or distribute it.
*You* cannot grant any rights to protectable elements authored by someone
else, unless you have a relicensing agreement. Neither the GPL nor the BSD
is one of those.

What the hell does that have to do with anything? Are you just trying to be
deliberately dense or waste time? Is it not totally obvious how the
principles I explain apply to a case like that?
Only someone who signs an NDA must comply with it. If you signed an NDA, you
must comply with it. An NDA can definitely subtract rights. It's a complex
question whether an NDA can subtract GPL rights, but again, that has nothing
to do with what we're talking about here.
Sure, you can have the right from me to do X and still not be allowed to do
X because you agreed with someone else not to do it. So what?

This is a misleading statement. The phrase "entire work" has two senses. The
license definitely does not cover the "entire work" in the sense of every
protectable element in the work unless each individual author of those
elements chose to offer that element under that license.
If by "entire work", you mean any compilation or derivative work copyright
the "final" author has, then yes, that's available under whatever license
the "final" author places it under. But that license does not actually
permit you to distribute the work.
This is really complicated and I wish I had a clear way to explain it.
Suppose I write a work and then you modify it. Assume your modification
includes adding new protectable elements to that work. When someone
distributes that new derivative work, they are distributing protectable
elements authored by both you and me.
Absent a relicensing agreement, they must obtain some rights from you and
some rights from me to do that. You cannot license the protectable elements
that I authored that are still in the resulting derivative work.

Exactly. Every protectable element in the final work is licensed by the
original author to every recipient who takes advantage of the license offer.

Only the author of any protectable element can license it, whether it's in a
derivated work or by itself.
You are seriously confused if you think that just because you create a
derivative work that includes my protectable elements you can then license
the elements I created under a license you choose.
Please read GPL section 6. The license *always* flows from the *original*
licensor to the ultimate licensee.

Well, in that case you are technically correct. Anyone can license anything
to anyone.
The point you need to understand is that to distribute any work (derivative,
composite, mere aggregation, whatever) that contains protectable elements
from multiple authors, you must obtain the right to every protectable
element you intend to distribute. You can only do so from the original
author or a relicensor. In the case of BSD or GPL licenses, there are no
relicensors.

No. Anything that is *necessary* to do X is part of X. Copying from disk to
RAM is necessary to use the work, so it is part of use.

You don't get a license because you don't need one. You aren't going to
distribute or modify Windows, so why would you need a license?
Microsoft may choose to impose what is really a click-through or shrink-wrap
contract. But it is not really a copyright license at all. In fact, such
agreements are enforceable even for works that cannot be copyrighted.

I don't know. Why does that matter?

You don't know and thus even if you have additional rights to the content,
you cannot exercise them. Having a right and being able to exercise it are
not the same thing. So what?

Presumably, you have some license that permits you to redistribute them so
long as you comply with certain terms.

It is true in any case where there isn't a relicensing agreement. There is
simply no other way it could work.
