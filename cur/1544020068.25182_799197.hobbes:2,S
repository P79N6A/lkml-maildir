Just ignoring VM_ACCOUNT for merging is not the right thing to do. It 
probably works in practice for just about everything, but at least in 
theory it does mean that mmap() can stop honoring MAP_NORESERVE.
Admittedly the circumstances where that happens are unlikely, and nobody 
probably even really uses MAP_NORESERVE in the first place, so I doubt you 
can ever see it as a real issue, but it's still technically wrong to merge 
vma's that can differ in VM_ACCOUNT.
Now, the particular test you have, VM_ACCOUNT differs only during that 
temporary window, and the vma's really do end up with the same VM_ACCOUNT 
state in the end, so merging them is correct, but if you were to privately 
map the same file (or private anonymous map) with the same permissions 
next to each other so that they -could- merge, but use MAP_NORESERVE on 
one and not on the other, then they shouldn't merge.
So VM_ACCOUNT does matter - just barely - for merging, and we just happen 
to currently hit it too much due to a very odd internal reason.
