Hi:
For almost all sites I cannot download using wget or ftp for example.
I can comunicate between two PCs using ssh and rsync however.
ping and traceroute also work fine.
I discovered this problem because I was unable to fetch any
file when using "emerge -f".
I tried with k 2.6.7 with exactly the same configuration and it works!
I am using gentoo in a laptop Compaq presario 2541EA.
The module is natsemi.c. I tried to copy this file from 2.6.7 into
2.6.9-rc1 and recompile the kernel without any success.
The problem still remains.
If any further information is need, pls. email me.
Thank you.
