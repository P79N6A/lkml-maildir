This is something of a bombshell.  Not necessarily a bad one, but...
Alan, do you have *any* *freakin'* *idea* how much more complicated
the CML2 deduction engine had to be because the basic logical entity
was a tristate rather than a bool?  If this plan goes through, I'm
going to be able to drop out at least 20% of the code, with most of
that 20% being in the nasty complicated bits where the maintainability
improvement will be greatest.  And I can get rid of the nasty "vitality"
flag, which probably the worst wart on the language.
Yowza...so how soon is this supposed to happen?
