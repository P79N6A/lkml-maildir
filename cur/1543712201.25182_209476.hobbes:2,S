And that .inf describes 'Linux'? No matter what the license is, you can link
to it and instruct people on how to change it. You could even show pieces of
the .inf with the linux data filled in ('fair use').
I ask about this because I know that to get adequate testing coverage,
experimenting with this code should be as easy as possible. Something like
'visit this URL and paste in the following: (...) and now do such and such
in windows and you should be set'. 
I'll happily write this for you if you provide the pointers.
Good luck!
