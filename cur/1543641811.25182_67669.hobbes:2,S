I disagree.
It reduces performance, and results in huge patches.
Furthermore you can't predict whether the target of a function pointer
will need credentials or not.

I don't insist on that (see below).

I do not propose to remove the idea of copy-on-write credentials, just
to use copy-on-write only for groups and "copy-always" for uid and gid
so that access to uid and gid doesn't need to go through the credentials
pointer.
You have code like this:
+                cred = get_current_vfscred();
                 fdata->fd_do_lml = 0;
-                fdata->fd_fsuid = current->fsuid;
-                fdata->fd_fsgid = current->fsgid;
+                fdata->fd_fsuid = cred->uid;
+                fdata->fd_fsgid = cred->gid;
                 fdata->fd_mode = file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mode;
-                fdata->fd_ngroups = current->ngroups;
-                for (i=0 ; i<current->ngroups ; i++)
-                        fdata->fd_groups[i] = current->groups[i]; 
+                fdata->fd_ngroups = cred->ngroups;
+                for (i=0 ; i<cred->ngroups ; i++)
+                        fdata->fd_groups[i] = cred->groups[i]; 
                 fdata->fd_bytes_written = 0; /*when open,written data is zero*/ 
                 file->private_data = fdata; 
+                put_vfscred(cred);
The get/put here only make sense if something else can modify the
credentials without it.
Otherwise, you can skip them since the reference count will always be >
0 because nothing else can change the current->vfscred pointer, and that
will contribute to the reference count.
What I'm trying to do is to design credentials in such a way that, even
with shared credentials, the get/put won't be necessary.
I'm also trying to put such credentials directly in task_struct so that
the code doesn't need to get a pointer from task_struct and then fetch
the credentials from the structure it points to.
The order of likelyhood of credential operations is assumed to be the
following:
1. Use/copy/local temporary modification of uid and gid
2. Use/copy/local temporary modification of groups
3. Permanent modification of something
* Local temporary modification means that the modification only has
effect on the current task and is revert before the end of the syscall
To optimize for this I propose to:
1. Put uid and gid directly in task_struct (optimize for 1)
2. Use copy-on-write on groups so that we avoid copying an big array
(optimize for 2.copy)
3. Change credentials only when not performing a syscall (optimize for 1
and 2)

I completely agree with this, that's the whole point!
