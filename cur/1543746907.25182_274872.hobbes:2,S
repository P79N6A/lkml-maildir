On bootup there are loads on lines 167 and 472.
On auto there are none.
On activate there are
******846*******
pnp: Device 00:0a activated.
On modprobe smsc-ircc2 there are no more debug lines, just
found SMC SuperIO Chip (devid=0x5a rev=00 base=0x002e): LPC47N227
smsc_superio_flat(): IrDA not enabled
smsc_superio_flat(): fir: 0x00, sir: 0x00, dma: 15, irq: 0, mode: 0x02
And I checked that I am using the new patch.
