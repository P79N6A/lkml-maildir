The locking is necessary.  Changes to cpu_online_map and
cpu_present_map must be serialized; otherwise you could end up trying
to online a cpu as it is being removed (i.e. cleared from
cpu_present_map).  Online operations must check that a cpu is present
before bringing it up (kernel/cpu.c):
/* Requires cpu_add_remove_lock to be held */
static int __cpuinit _cpu_up(unsigned int cpu, int tasks_frozen)
{
	int ret, nr_calls = 0;
	void *hcpu = (void *)(long)cpu;
	unsigned long mod = tasks_frozen ? CPU_TASKS_FROZEN : 0;
	if (cpu_online(cpu) || !cpu_present(cpu))
		return -EINVAL;
	....

I guess so, but I don't really see the need...
