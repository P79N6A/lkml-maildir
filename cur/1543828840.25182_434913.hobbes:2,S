With MSI-X we can't be a NOOP so it is clearly a bug.
With MSI it might happen, and I don't have a problem if it becomes
a noop.  At the same time I'm not convinced it isn't a bug.
All I really care about is that we don't try and do the impossible and
enable the msi from a half initialized software state like we were doing
before.
That was really ugly and impossible to get right.
