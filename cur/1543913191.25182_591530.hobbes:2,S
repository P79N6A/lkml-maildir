I am not sure what you mean by same policy. Same configuration for all 
slabs?

Would it be possible to try the two other approaches that I suggested? I 
think both of those may also solve the issue. Try booting with
slab_max_order=0 and see what effect it has. The queues of the page 
allocator can be much larger than what slab has for 4k pages. There is 
really not much of a point in using a slab allocator for page sized 
allocations.
