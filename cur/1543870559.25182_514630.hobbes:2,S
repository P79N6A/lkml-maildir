We seems to move far away from original topic - I never built any
assumptions on top of kevent _performance_ - kevent is a logical
extrapolation of the epoll, I only showed that event driven model can be
fast and it outperforms threadlet one - after we changed topic we were
unable to actually test threadlets in networking environment, since the
only test I ran showed that threadlest do not reschedule at all, and
Ingo's tests showed small number of reschedulings.
So, I only talked that kevent is superior compared to epoll because (and
it is _main_ issue) of its ability to handle essentially any kind of
events with very small overhead (the same as epoll has in struct file -
list and spinlock) and without significant price of struct file binding
to event.
I did not want and do not want to hurt anyone (even Ingo, although he is 
against kevent :), but my opinion is that thread moved from nice 
discussion about threads and events with jokes and fun into quite angry 
word throwings, and that is too good - let's make it fun again.
I'm not a native english speaker (and do not use a dictionary), so it is 
quite possible that some my phrases were not exactly nice, but it was 
unintentional (at least not very) :)
Peace?
