Can you please send this stuff along to me?
You know I own an Athlon (since yester Athlon II 1 GHz :-) and need some 
input...
Mobo is MSI MS-6167 Rev 1.0B (AMD Irongate C4, yes the very first one)
Kernel with preempt patch and mmx/3dnow! optimization crash randomly.
Never had that (without preempt) during the last two years.
Thanks,
