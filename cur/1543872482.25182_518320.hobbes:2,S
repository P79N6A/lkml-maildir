Sure - avoid them if you like.  But sometimes they work out rather
well.  And file system API's are sometimes the best fit for them.
I'm all for choosing the simplest API topology that makes sense.
But encoding higher dimension topologies into lower dimension API's,
just because they seem "simpler" results in obfuscation, convolution
and obscurity, which ends up costing everyone more than getting the
natural fit.
