Well, it registers the client with jackd, sets up the ports, registers
the process() callback and then simply goes to sleep() for the desired
runtime of the program. All these are non RT ops and should never be
able to cause any xruns.
All the work is done by the process() callback which is called by
libjack in a SCHED_FIFO thread. The process() callback is called once
for each buffer that jackd processes.
I cannot explain the detailed mechanism of how jackd wakes its clients
and communicates with them myself too well, so i'll leave this to Paul
Davis (CC'ed). Care to elaborate, Paul?
