Note that 2.4.0-test* doesn't have kpiod just now (it's been dropped in
the 2.3.x cycle). Here I was wondering only about 2.2.x.

arghh b is a problem. I could workaround that with per per-process bitflag
set before down(&inode->i_sem) that reminds me not to write on any fs
because I would risk to recurse on the inode->i_sem.
The main problem I have with kpiod is that while it obviously avoids any
kind of deadlocks on the fs since make_pio_request is completly
asynchronous, it also introduces a problem in the swap_out code where we
have no way to know if we did some progress or not and if we should wait
some buffer to be written to disk. Waiting in shrink_mmap isn't even
enough since kpiod could have not yet been started writing and so there
may be none locked or dirty buffer in first place... We can't even wait on
kpiod ala wakeup_bdflush(1) since it would re-introduce the same deadlock
problem making kpiod useless for its anti-deadlock purpose.
So the only sane solution looked to me to skip the filemap_swapout when we
can't do it, and to do it ourselfs when we can. The problem is the "when
we can". Do you think it would be insane to implement the workaround I
mentioned above around the write semaphore?

I'll think some more on it.
