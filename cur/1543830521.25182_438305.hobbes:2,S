Connector supports check for listeners before allocation quite long ago.

Depending on how are you going to use it.
It is obviously required for receiving data from userspace, but if you
only want to send data from kernelspace you can use cn_netlink_send()
without registering callback, but in that case you must provide group
number to cn_netlink_send().
