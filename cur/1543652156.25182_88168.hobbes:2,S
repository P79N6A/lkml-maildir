No I do not.

Yes I do.

Nope :)
(yes, I do wonder, and yes, they will be cleaned up...)

No, lets start pulling stuff out of pci_dev and relying on struct
device.  The reason this hasn't happened yet is no one has been willing
to break all of the PCI drivers, yet.
I know Pat is going to be doing this soon, and if he doesn't get to it,
I will.  But as Adam said, don't throw away the idea because it looks
crufty now.  This has been a _constantly_ evolving model as we work to
get it right.  It will take time, and we are still getting there.

In my defense, USB was the _only_ bus willing to step up and try to do
the integration to work the initial kinks out.  The SCSI people are
being drug kicking and screaming into it, _finally_ now (hell, SCSI is
still not using the updated PCI interface, those people _never_ update
their drivers if they can avoid it.)

Sure SCSI's more interesting, to you :)
By having USB be one of the first adopters (after PCI), we have found a
_lot_ of issues and bugs that happened due to devices showing up and
disappearing at odd times.  Which was _much_ easier to debug than PCI
would have been.  SCSI can't even do hotplug devices _yet_.  How would
we have debugged this stuff then?
And yes, USB belongs in the model, if for no other reason, that "it's a
bus and it has devices on it" :)

Patches for this stuff are going to be happening for quite some time
now, don't despair.
And they are greatly appreciated, and welcomed from everyone :)
thanks,
