I thought on this, and I came to the conclusion that the tree rotations
used to balance binary trees are incompatible with RCU. The rotation can
hide one branch. Hence I started writing a B+tree that is RCU compatible
much like the Radix tree.
Current code here:

Still needs some work, but is usable.
