That's only for simple apps.

You don't understand [cm]alloc(). You confusing malloc(), which allocates
space in the process (virtual) space, and calloc() which allocates space and
touches it. malloc() is very needed for the same reason sparce files are
needed. 
You need to look at sparse table and weakly connected graph algorithms.
