Did you enable/select it?
It's not on by default (in 2.6.11-rc2).
First you need to enable this one:
config I2C_KEYWEST
	tristate "Powermac Keywest I2C interface"
	depends on I2C && PPC_PMAC
and then this one:
config THERM_PM72
	tristate "Support for thermal management on PowerMac G5"
	depends on I2C && I2C_KEYWEST && PPC_PMAC64
