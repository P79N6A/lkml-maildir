APIC error on CPU1: 00(02)
APIC error on CPU0: 00(02)
I've spent some time trying to research these error messages, but I'm
not exactly sure what I'm looking at.  I've read that these may indicate
a faulty or soon to go faulty processor.  However, when I do get these
errors, it always involves both processors.  What are the odds both
would be dying at the same time?
Please CC, thanks!
