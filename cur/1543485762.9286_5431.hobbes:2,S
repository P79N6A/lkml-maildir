Subject: 2.2.2-pre2: it's back (cache vs. data) & kpiod

2.2.2-pre2 seems to be again aggressively (not as bad as < 2.2.0-final
though) throwing out data pages in preference of cache pages. This can
be produced by running bonnie. Neither 2.2.1 nor 2.2.0-ac2 behaved this
badly.
Now, for the kpiod matter. I haven't dug any deeper into this issue but
I guess it is because of kpiod since this didn't happen before when I
was running 2.2.1. When running bonnie just after the "Rewriting
intelligently phase" when bonnie begins the "reading with getc()..." my
machine gets totally inresponsive for 30 seconds or so. I observed this
by watching at the "vmstat 1" output in a second xterm, it didn't get
updated for a while (infact I couldn't do anything, not even switch
windows in X). When it did, vmstat gave the appended output. I have the
complete "vmstat 1" log of the run if somebody is interested.
Seems like kpiod isn't doing it's work in a continuous manner and when
it notices the amount of uncompleted requests filling up rapidly it is
already too late. Then the rest of the time is spent to clear up that
queue. Just a guess, I haven't looked how kpiod really works.
