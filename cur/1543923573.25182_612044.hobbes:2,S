As it turns out, our organizations version control server just blew up 
last night. The filesystem is rather corrupt at the moment, fortunately 
we have backups.
We are running 2.6.22.5 (vanilla) on Debian 4.0. It has two SATA devices 
with Linux software raid mirror (mdadm) on Intel ata_piix chipset.
The filesystem is EXT3.
1. This happened during nightly backup:
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (177777)
ata1.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata1.00: cmd ca/00:68:6f:3a:00/00:00:00:00:00/e0 tag 0 cdb 0x0 data 53248 out
         res 40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x4 (timeout)
ata1: port is slow to respond, please be patient (Status 0xd0)
ata1: device not ready (errno=-16), forcing hardreset
ata1: soft resetting port
ata1.00: revalidation failed (errno=-2)
ata1: failed to recover some devices, retrying in 5 secs
ata1: soft resetting port
ata1.00: configured for UDMA/133
ata1: EH complete

Aborting journal on device md2.
ext3_abort called.
EXT3-fs error (device md2): ext3_journal_start_sb: Detected aborted journal
Remounting filesystem read-only
__journal_remove_journal_head: freeing b_committed_data
2. I rebooted
3. fsck -p on boot failed
(it is very probable not many files were corrupted at this stage)
4. I ran fsck.ext3 -y
=> that corrupted lots and lots of files. This went 
into a loop, the fsck.ext3 restarted checking over and over again.
