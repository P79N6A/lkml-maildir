Yeah, that's a bit tacky though.  We added it because reviewers
(probably Adrian Bunk, or maybe akpm) noticed the Xen code
unconditionally using cmpxchg, and I added tsc because, well, we use it.
But you're right; we can't get to any of the Xen code without booting
under Xen, which necessarily means all those features are available,
regardless of how the kernel is configured.
What config combinations do you want to support?
