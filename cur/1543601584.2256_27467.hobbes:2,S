Why not simply add it to the next -pre cycle (if 2.4.10 is nearby), ie 
2.4.11-pre1 has it, it goes through a few revisions of -pre and if it's 
stable enough for mainstream, have it standard for 2.4.11, otherwise 
just drop it, fix it, squash it, or do whatever with it :)
And if 2.4.10 isn't that close, add it to -pre13 and do the same, having 
it permanently in 2.4.10 (or not if it's nuclear).
