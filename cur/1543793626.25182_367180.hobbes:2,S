Hi Patrick,
           I found your email on netdev mailing list. I see that a
priority argument has been added to hard_start_xmit() in the latest
IPW2200. Is there a user space API to use the new argument with the
existing socket API? Does one need to necessarily add a new
sys_socketcall to utilize the priority argument in hard_start_xmit().
Any info shared on this would be very much appreciated. Thanks! Surya
