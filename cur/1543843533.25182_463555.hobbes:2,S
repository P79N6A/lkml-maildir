A mildly better alternative is (on 32-bit architectures, 64-bit archs  
have no problem) change the typedef from this:
> #if defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
> typedef unsigned long long __u64;
> typedef   signed long long __s64;

to this:

GCC always supports __extension__ to indicate not to warn or error on  
GCC-only extensions.  You only have to declare __extension__ on the  
typedef, any uses are considered OK.  I think this also works for  
code-expressions like this:
> int x = __extension__ ({ foo(); 1; })
but I don't remember exactly.  In certain really complex expressions  
GCC can get confused and give bogus errors, but as long as you don't  
start sprinkling it in macros you should be fine.
