not sure if we should pass this bit of info, I guess if we add it we can
just threats all reads equally and give them the spare reserved
requests unconditionally, so the highlevel isn't complicated (of course
it would be optional, so nothing would break but it would be annoying
for benchmarking new fs having to patch stuff first to see the effect of
the spare reserved requests).
