Subject: 2.6.24-git15 Keyboard Issue?

I built 2.6.24-git15 this morning and seem to have picked up a little
“funny” along the way – occasionally what should be a single key stroke
ends up spraying multiple characters on to my screen.
By this I mean I type “w” and get “wwwwwwwww” or whatever. 
This has happened a number of times with random keys so I don't think
that it is a sticky key and I did not see this on previous builds.
Has anyone else had this happen to them?  While they were sober that
is.
