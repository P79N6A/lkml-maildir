This can have static scope.  And, please, no spaces after the function name,
nor after the `*' thingy.  ext2 is all over the place in this regard and I'm
slowly trying to get it consistent.
I'm not sure that skipping setting s_dirt is desirable.  Sure, we haven't
actually altered the superblock.  But we sort-of "virtually dirtied" it.  The
superblock is now out-of-date and we should sync it.
It could be that not writing the superblock for a week is an OK thing to do. 
inode and block allocation counts are something which fsck can trivially fix
up.  But at the cost of a single sector write per five seconds I think it's
best to keep the superblock more up-to-date.
I'll make the same change to the block allocator patches.

hm, I wonder if this should be in a separate cacheline.  We may as well use a
single lock if they're this close together.  Bill, can you test that
sometime?
