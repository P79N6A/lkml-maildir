Not true.  SETTRIGGER is (generally) only called once to start things 
(and things are getting started or else it would set at 0 instead of at 
65536).  After that, SETTRIGGER isn't typically called again unless you 
are turning the device off.  It's calls to GETOPTR that are suppossed to 
keep the LVI-CIV tail chasing going on.
