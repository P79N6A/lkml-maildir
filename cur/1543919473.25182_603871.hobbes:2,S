I think that would be a bug if anything actually managed to trip that
code.  all of the may_open() calls should have been covered by the
__dentry_open() mnt writer.

Yes, it is.  I'll add a big fat comment this time about why we need it.

You're right, this does introduce that race, and it is relatively hard
to fix properly.  But, the 'return a filp' patch makes it easy to fix.
I've put a temporary kludge in the updated version of this patch, and
fixed it properly in that later patch.

It certainly should.
