I'll see your rant and raise you a nickel.

Of course they can do that.  They get to decide what they push and
what they don't.  I don't think you understand BK.  What we are talking
about is the problem that the change has been committed to CVS, other
changes are built on top of it, and now Linus realizes that the change
was bad news.  The problem is extracting stuff out of the middle which
has already been built upon for more stuff.  How would you propose solving
that problem because that is the problem statement?
If someone sends Linus a patch, he checks into BK or CVS or whatever,
he then gets 5 other patches and applies them in BK/CVS, and THEN he
wants to take out the first patch, how would you suggest we do that?
