I guess I should just shut up and listen to experts... ok, just my
0.02 roubles.
Again, I can't comment things like "we just should never touch kernel",
because I don't even remotely undestand the things which actually use
freezer. I can only talk about the current implementation of freezer.

Yes, the current design has many limitations. The major problem is that it
can't solve the dependencies: say T1 is frozen, and T2 can't be freezed
because it waits for T1. And I don't see how we can solve this problem
in general. And this is imho the source of most uglifications.
Let's look at the code. try_to_freeze_tasks() which can choose between
user/kernel threads is static. The exported freeze_processes() freeze
all of them. So why do we need is_user_space() at all? I am not sure
I know the right answer, but I think this was done to prevent the case
when user-space needs some kthread to make a progress and notice the
signal (TIF_FREEZE).
So yes, this is ugly, and is_user_space() is not reliable, and most
fixes are "let's fix this particular case", and each fix doesn't make
the code prettier.
But, on the other hand, the freezer is very simple and not intrusive.
When I first looked at the code 2 months ago, I thought we should do
something better. Since then, I have no ideas how to do this.
