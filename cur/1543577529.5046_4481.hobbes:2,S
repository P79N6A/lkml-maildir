  Hello,
I tried installing 2.4.0 on my digital alpha server 400 /233 , and with no
success... First, I tried compiling it with ncr53c7,8xx driver, and it
failed with signal 1 ( always failed there.... that file never wanted to
compile, no matter how I tried)  ... I blame the compiler there, but I
didn't wanted to change the compiler, and I saw there was another driver
that supports the controler, so I compiled with it, and the machine
stopped at the detection , just doing resets on the SCSI bus... The same
driver works with 2.2.18 ( I checked, in 2.4 the driver is older than in
2.2)... 
  Any ideas?
