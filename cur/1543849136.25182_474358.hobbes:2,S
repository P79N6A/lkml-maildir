OK, then I don't understand.  There is about 1GB of memory on node 0,
which is about half of the partition's memory, and it is even in a
contiguous chunk, but it doesn't start at pfn 0:
early_node_map[3] active PFN ranges
    1:        0 ->    32768
    0:    32768 ->   278528
    1:   278528 ->   524288
So it's not that node 0 doesn't have any pages.  Any other clues?
Thanks,
Paul.
