Subject: [BK PATCH] PCI fixes for 2.6.0-test5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some PCI patches against 2.6.0-test5.  They fix the problem
with PCI drivers declaring their probe function as __init or __devinit
and then not selecting CONFIG_HOTPLUG.  When a user would try to add a
new device id by using the "new_id" file in the driver's sysfs
directory, it would cause an oops.  So now the "new_id" file is only
enabled if CONFIG_HOTPLUG is selected, and we've fixed up all of the PCI
drivers to mark their probe functions (and child functions and data) as
__devinit.
Thanks to Matt Domsch for the big patch, and all of the other people who
helped figure this out.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
