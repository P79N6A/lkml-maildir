    Heck, even glibc was not used by most distributions before a few years ago.
Most or all GNU/Linux distributions in 1993 used a modified version of
GNU libc.  They called it "Linux libc", so you might not have realized
it was actually GNU libc modified.
We wanted GNU libc to work unmodified in GNU/Linux systems, so we paid
the original author of GNU libc to do the necessary work.  The result
was GNU libc version 2.
