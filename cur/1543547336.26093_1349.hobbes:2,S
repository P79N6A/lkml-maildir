   Sorry, I've no idea about the ext2 and fs implementation.
   However did you read the comment below and convince yourself that 'err' is
   always set correctly?
I looked at it and was convinced.  I wish Jan hadn't sent the patch
directly to Linus, though, since I had a few other patches that I was
going to send to Linus directly.  Now depending on whether or not he
accepted your patch, he may reject my patch entirely and I'll have to
wait until test8-pre2 before I can figure out what to base my patch off
of.....  Ah well, life in the big city when the central maintainer
refuses to use CVS.....
   Also, I might be wrong, but maybe you should submit things to Alan, not
   Linus, could be it suffices to post them here though.
Actually, life is a little bit easier when you give the subsystem
maintainer a chance to submit patches to Linus.
