Huh? I'm running a file server with an MVP3 with a K6-2/300 and 40G in
UDMA disks (10-12Mb/s each) without problems (good performance and good
stability, on 2.2.3). As a result, I am positively in favor of the VIA
MVP3 (although, the socket370 celerons get really cheap too nowadays).
What DMA problems should I be looking for?
