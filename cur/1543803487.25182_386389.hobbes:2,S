Hi,
Sorry for the crosspost, I just wasn't sure which group should I target.
Here is what I try to do : I got to modify the standard colors used by setterm,
the reason being my preference for using text consoles rather than xterms.
I also prefer the fg green bg black setup. I can acheave that just by
simply issuing a "setterm -foreground green -store". Now my problem is
that the green I get is too dark on my screeen (even if I set the display
luminosity to max). If I could modify the color used by setterm I
could get a bit
brighter green, but I'm not sure where/how to do that...
I've been looking in the kernel sources in the "console.c" and I think
spotted the
place where the colours are set but it seems to me that a more appropiate
place to do such things would be the terminfo db.
Any hints ?
I'm using radeonfb under Suse/amd64 if that makes any difference...
Rgds
Thomas
