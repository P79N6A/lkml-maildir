First, please upgrade to 2.4.0-test7 (with no pre7 on it).

You need to give the "-p1" option to patch.  It looks like you forgot
to do that.

drivers/Makefile now mentions "media" in its SUB_DIRS line, so
drivers/media/media.o always exists.
I bet that because you applied the patch badly, you missed out on
this patch to drivers/Makefile.
I just built a 2.4.0-test7, straight out of the tar file, i386 arch,
"make oldconfig" default options (media turned off).  I have a
drivers/media/media.o and my vmlinux links with no errors.
