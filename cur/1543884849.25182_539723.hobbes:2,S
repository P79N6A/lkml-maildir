Hi Manu,
The saying that you stated is a very christian one.
I perhaps should state that I am 47 years old now, raised in in utmost reactionary region called Bavaria (Western Germany), and also raised by parents of Russian / Polonian origin who shared the Nazi regime with the usual "I-do-not-want-to-talk-about-it-and-I-do-not-want-to-feel-responsible-about-it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              "-behaviour.
And I am very much not only interested in german post-war history, but I simply love to write provocative letters or mails to make my conviction utmost clear that all this capitalist bullshit around us should vanish and shrink and be overcome some day.
Basic christian ideals are very close to basic marxist ideas.
The one who never does perceive that is a real poor human being in my eyes, if not to say: a complete idiot or a system-conforming hypocrite.
BUT:
I in fact do not read this "saying" for the first time:
In my personal experience (feel very sorry about it, but it's true) it has always truthfully been an excuse for persons being strongly limited on what I would call utmost primitive instincts like greed or rapacity (i. e. the utmost perfect sounding "would-like-to-capitalists", if not to say: the perfect slaves or: the perfect counterrevolutionaries or strike-breakers, if not to say: the utmost perfect asscreepers).
Please forgive me for that statement, but I am simply stating my personal experiences very truthfully, without playing any politics, but just telling you my "personal truth" or the sum of all my personal life experience unfortunately bound to that.
And if there is discussion needed on that we should do it private or anyway on some other thread, but definitely not on this one.
Hints to help you to understand the difference:
1. There is a GPL license written by Richard Stallman whose origin I do not know:
Its essence is the philosophy to share and to be highly transparent as far as information level is concerned.
2. There is a saying by Linus in which he states the best choice he ever did was conforming his work to the terms of Richard Stallman, the GPL.
3. Wikipedia says that Linus's father was no christian at all, but simply a communist.
See, Manu, there are deeply primitive instinct-driven hypocrites around like hell, but there are also truthful human beings around.
But:
The Internet does not provide a platform to find out who is who and what is what.
The Internet may be necessary, but in the end it's just a drag, isn't it?
Sincerely
Uwe
