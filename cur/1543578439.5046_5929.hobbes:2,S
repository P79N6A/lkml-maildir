i think that the AMD APIC is truly 'compatible', but we are trying to
enable the APIC and program performance counters in an Intel-way. The MSRs
can be incompatible between steppings of the same CPU, so we should not
mark something 'incompatible' on that basis.
so the correct statement is: the UP-P6-specific way of enabling APICs does
not work on Athlons. It doesnt work on P5's either.
