The way you currently define "disabled" means that even symbols set to 'm' 
are disabled, I don't think that's what you really mean. :) When seeing 
disabled I also first thought of the option being completely invisible due 
to dependencies.

Dependencies can also be something like !FOO, in this case you want FOO to 
be disabled for option to be unhidden. So if this is intended as a simple 
"Click this link to enable this option", then this requires a bit more 
work. :)

Using colors is not the problem, I'm more concerned about using red, as 
it's a signal color, often meaning that something is wrong or needs urgent 
attention.
