Well, I got a reply from Simon Kirby who told me that he had also
seen oopses in find_buffer or select_dcache on certain machines,
and in all cases it had been bad RAM. He _also_ included a small
Linux memory tester that I ran for an hour or so and sure enough,
it found a bit error (0x6c vs 0x2c) so indeed, the box has bad
memory and it is extremely likely that this is the cause of all
the troubles we're having with it.
Somehow if you have bad RAM, it is likely to result in oopses in
find_buffer or select_dcache - perhaps a symptom to remember (I will).
If anyone wants a copy of the memory tester I'd be happy to send
it to you (I'm sure Simon doesn't mind)
Mike.
