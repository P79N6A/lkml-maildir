Nice!  Good work.

*shrug*  I don't cringe if that's the most expedient way to do something.
But I really don't think that is necessary.  I will take a look at docs 
and see how things match up, when I am much more awake.  Most likely you 
need to be using another set of registers, and be all MMIO, all the time.
