You might be talking about two different patches -- one for cd-rw
support (this is the pktcdvd (or -packet) patch that Peter Osterlund has
been maintaining) and the other for cd-mrw. The cd-mrw patch is very
small, not a lot is required to support that in the cd driver.
Supporting cd-rw is a lot harder, basically you have to do in software
what cd-mrw does in hardware (defect management, read-modify-write
packet gathering, etc).
cd-mrw will definitely be in 2.6. cd-rw support maybe, I haven't even
looked at that lately.
