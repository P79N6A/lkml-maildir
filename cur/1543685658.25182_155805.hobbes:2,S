No, your patch isn't silly, it's EVIL. It fundamentally breaks the notion 
of "grep for usage" by introducing two names to the same thing, without 
having even a good reason (ie no "nice abstraction" thing or anything).
So that's just bad.
In contrast, switching "authflavour" to "authflavor" (to match the type) 
ahs the advantage of _improving_ greppability.
