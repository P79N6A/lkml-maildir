There is reasonable consensus on making use of 240/4; some applications,
such as ISAKMP and automatic ipv6-to-IPv4 tunneling, still need to determine
if they should treat the space as "public" or "private" but that shouldn't
affect whether kernel support is added.
Solaris recently added support for 240/4 and OSX already has it. I thought
the Linux kernel developers might appreciate having patches to do likewise.
I leave it up to you, the developers, to decide if you want to use these
patches.
