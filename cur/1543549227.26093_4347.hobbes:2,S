Hello,
I have a program that makes HTTP requests in a loop to a box runing Linux. 
It goes through another Linux box, which is using proxy ARP and is connected
to the client and the web server using a cross over cable
[CLIENT]----[PROXY]----[WEBSERVER]
When the proxy machine uses 2.2 series kernel, I see a certain bit rate,
call it X.  X stays constant always, no matter how many times I run my
workload.
When I upgraded to 2.4-test8, I see the following behavior:
Initial run (fresh boot) I see a speed greater than X (4X)  subsequent runs,
the bit rate keeps dropping and becomes 1/3X!  The only way to get back the
first bit rate is to reboot!
Please some one tell me if this issue will be resolved.
Thanks
Lee
