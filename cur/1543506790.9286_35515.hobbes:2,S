    I thought that zip drive is hardwired ad 4th device, but sometimes Linux
    discovers it under /dev/sda1 not /dev/sda4. This gives me troubles with
    my /etc/fstab since I don't know, where the zip drive will be next time...
If the partition table on /dev/sda goes empty,empty,empty,stuff
then stuff will be /dev/sda4. If it goes stuff,empty,empty,empty
then stuff will be /dev/sda1.
You can put two lines
	/dev/sda1	/mnt/zip	...
	/dev/sda4	/mnt/zip	...
in /etc/fstab.
(And if you like to say "umount /mnt/zip" then
use the umount from util-linux-2.9w, released yesterday.)
