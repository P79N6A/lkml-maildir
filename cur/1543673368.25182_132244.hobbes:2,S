Your problem looks the same, though isn't, for your kernel finds a MADT:
ACPI: RSDP (v000 KT400                      ) @ 0x000f74a0
ACPI: RSDT (v001 KT400  AWRDACPI 16944.11825) @ 0x3fff3000
ACPI: FADT (v001 KT400  AWRDACPI 16944.11825) @ 0x3fff3040
vvvvv
ACPI: MADT (v001 KT400  AWRDACPI 16944.11825) @ 0x3fff71c0
^^^^^
ACPI: DSDT (v001 KT400  AWRDACPI 00000.04096) @ 0x00000000
ACPI: BIOS passes blacklist
And ACPI uses the IOAPIC, as expected:
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
Unfortunately, we're talking two different bugs :(
