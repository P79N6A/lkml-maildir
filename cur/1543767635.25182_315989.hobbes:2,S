Oh boy, it's Nemosoft time again ..
Just some interesting information for people not familiar with
you and the PWC story:
    +--------------------------------------------------------------+
    | The NDA you signed with Philips concerning the decompression |
    | algorithms used by PWC HAS EXPIRED ALMOST 2 YEARS AGO !!!    |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------+
You have stated this yourself on Wed, 25 Aug 2004 00:58:24 +0200.
It appears to me that you are very unhappy about the fact that your
childish attempt to hurt the PWC(X) users by removing your PWC stuff
from your website did not work at all.  The only result was that we very
soon had a nice completely open source driver for PWCX and that nobody
depends on you and your binary-only driver anymore.  This is perfect,
thank you very much for your actions ..
I think it's just *YOU* who doesn't like the idea of an open source PWC
decompressor, not Philips.  Maybe your Philips contacts will be able to
convince you that you're wrong ..
