Subject: [PATCH 2.6.0-test11] agpgart [amd64] fix (off by one)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

AGPGart would report "Too many northbridges" without this
patch. The problem was that 'i' was incremented before being
checked against the MAX GARTS, just making the check > instead
of == fixes the problems.  Patch here:
