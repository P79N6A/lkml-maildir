Capability wouldn't use it, though, so that slot would be wasted.  In my
patch, capability, cap_stack, and root_plug don't ask for a slot.

If you get -1 back, you didn't get a static slot.  But you don't have to
care as a module writer, the security_*_value functions will default to
using the shared slot if idx==-1.

This (idx != -1) means you got a static slot.
Of course this can now switch to idx==num_slots meaning you use the
shared slot.

If we do switch to all LSMs getting a slot, should we just have the
return value for register_security and mod_reg_security be the slot#, or
-error?
