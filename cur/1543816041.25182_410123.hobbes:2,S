I have just 256MB on this laptop and I know its limits.
IME swap prefetch helps expecially when I need to open some memory
demanding application for just a few mintues (OO.org, gimp on large
images, pretty large builds, any 3D app) and then go back to my usual
<high number> of xterms.
I did definitely noticed the difference when Andrew dropped the patch
the first time. As already said, it seems so natural the idea of
swapping-in when some room is available that I immediately got used to
having this functionality and I support its inclusion.
Thanks
