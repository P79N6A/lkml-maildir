Maybe. But requiring people upgrade their userspace tools or setup for
2.6.22 isn't a reasonable solution.

Except userspace is currently expecting 8 loop nodes upon bootup.
Creating n+1 when n is opened is good, but racy if userspace tries to
mount serveral loop devices in parallel.
If the loop device instantiates 8 (or max_loop) upon init, then we're
compatible with how things are being done in 2.6.21 and earlier.

No, backing that code out wasn't good enough -- the reporter tested
reverting both of Al's patches out and was still getting errors on
boot. It took reverting your original one out as well to make it work.
So, a compromise? Let's start with 8 (or max_loop) populated, and then
we can move forward separately with teaching userspace new loop
tricks.
