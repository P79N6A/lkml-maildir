It's a cleanup, I think that current code is correct.

Ok.

I guess you are talking about this patch:

I agree completely.

I'm not an expert at all, so I may be wrong, but I don't think
it's a good idea.
I think it is bad if __run_timers() could be preempted while
->running_timer != NULL. This will interact badly with __mod_timer,
del_timer_sync. I think that __run_timers() should do:
	set_running_timer(base, timer);
	preempt_disable();
	spin_unlock_irq(&base->lock);
	timer->function();
	set_running_timer(base, NULL);
	preempt_enable();
	spin_lock_irq(&base->lock);
What do you think?
Oleg.
