Having a more flexible mechanism for managing skb_shared_info->frags
would definitely be an improvement.  At the moment we can't indicate
whether the individual frags are writable so we assume every frag to
be read-only.
If we had a flag to indicate writability we could also have a flag to
indicate that the memory comes from kmalloc rather than alloc_page.
Cheers,
