Subject: [PATCH 4/8] Cleanup setup_pda
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The comment above this function has never been true in mainline:
talking to Jeremy it's from previous patch churn.  What setup_pda
actually does is to write the segment entry for boot_pda into the
boot_gdt_table.  Ideally, this would be a static initialization, but
because the addresses are split over multiple parts in the funk bit
layout of the GDT entry (thanks Intel!) that's not a valid C
initializer.
We in fact call this routine on every CPU bringup, but that's
harmless.  Non-boot CPUs switch to their own GDTs immediately in
initialize_secondary.
VMI certainly doesn't need to call it explicitly.
