If I was not explicit, I meant that tasklet_kill called from process 
context, for recursive tasklets will *always* hang on a UP machine at 
least till 2.4 when the kernel was not premptible. And yes, "always". The 
logic says that and experimentation also shows that.

So a better name would be wait_for_tasklet_completion. I think now I 
understand the
intent. If somebody is unloading a module which has scheduled a tasklet, 
the module cleanup function wants to be sure that the tasklet is not 
sitting on any CPU queue waiting to be executed (if that happens the 
tasklet might try to access the module address space and if that happens 
after the module unload we will get an OOPS). Once tasklet_kill completes 
the caller of tsaklet_kill has the responsibility to make sure that it is 
not scheduled again (if it is scheduled it will again start running 
happily as if nothing has happened)
All is fine, but the recursive tasklet problem is still there. We need 
to add another state to tasklet TASKLET_STATE_KILLED which is set once 
tasklet_kill is called. Once this is set tasklet_schedule just does not 
schedule the tasklet.

Thanx for making things clear.
