That sounds good to me, provided you add to dev_pm_info a pointer to an
array of string pointers, the names of the available states.  For now all
devices can share a single array with just two entries ("on" and "off",
or even "0" and "2").  In the future, bus drivers will be able to
substitute a pointer to a private array with device-specific state names.
Of course, this change will require you to add something like
	const char *name;
to the pm_message_t struct.  PM-aware drivers will be able to use it to
see which state was requested, and other drivers can ignore it.
In fact, for PM-aware drivers the name field makes the event field 
unnecessary.  But until all drivers are PM-aware we can't get rid of it.
