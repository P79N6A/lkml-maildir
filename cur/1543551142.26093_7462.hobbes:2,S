This e-mail is to thank everybody who answered, and to let you know that
the solution I'm using is the one suggested by Nigel Gamble
<nigel@mvista.com>:
"You could use a semaphore for this.  Initialize it to 0, then call
down() from the ioctl, and up() from the interrupt handler.  If the
up() happens before the down(), the down() won't go to sleep."
Initializing it to 0 means:
	cfg_sem = MUTEX_LOCKED;
It's the simplest to understand, and it works great!!
Does anybody see a problem with this implementation??
Thanks again!!
Later,
Ivan
