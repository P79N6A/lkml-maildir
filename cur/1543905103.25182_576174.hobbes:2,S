Hrm, no evidence of that so far indeed. I'm worried by the stack usage
of the unmap_mapping_ranges() but appart from that, no.
Appart from that, yeah, I suppose we can have a macro defining how many
on-stack backup we have and adjust it if we see that being a problem.
I'm not fan of dynamic on-stack allocations.
Ben.
