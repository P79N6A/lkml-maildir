The I²C list would be the best place to send such a patch. You could
also copy it to the linux-embedded list if it's likely to be of interest
to a reasonable proportion of "embedded" developers, but that wouldn't
be the primary route into Linus' tree for most things.
I can't really see any way to make that clear in the MAINTAINERS file
that wouldn't be clumsy and just as confusing -- I think it'll work out
just fine by itself. Do you have a concrete proposal?
