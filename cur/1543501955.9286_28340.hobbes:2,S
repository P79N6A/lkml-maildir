Intriguing. I was under the impression that what Metrowerks is
currently shipping for Linux consists of their IDE driving egcs and
gdb. Their web pages seem to concur; have they released their full
compiler and simply not updated their pages? That'd be somewhat
surprising.
Are you _sure_ you're using the Metrowerks compiler and not their IDE
calling egcs?
