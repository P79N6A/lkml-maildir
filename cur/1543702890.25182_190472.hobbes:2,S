Are you saying I should turn it on, but just not select a specific 
makers chip-boardset?  Or that I should go get a different card?
In which case I'd have about an 80 dollar limit as I'm not a game 
player that needs a 500 dollar video card.  OTOH, as long as I stay 
the hell away from nvidias own drivers, this card has been quite 
bulletproof.  The only thing thats missing is the GLX extensions.
The last time I brought an ATI card home, the box carried no 
indication that it was anything but what it said it was.  But it 
couldn't be made to work, new vendor/product code return.  I called 
ATI on my quarter and was told rather snippishly that it worked fine 
with their windows drivers that were on the cd, and that if I wanted 
support, I had to be running windows.  So I bought a driver from 
xorg, didn't work, same problem, except no refund was available.  I 
got snotty, and they did too.  Screw both of 'em, and the camels that 
rode in on them,  That left nvidia as the other major player, so 
thats what I bought with my refund.  It worked right out of the box.
tvtime, even running full screen, runs just fine here on this old 
card, as does the vlc stuff, but thats the extent of my requirements 
for full motion video.
But, I'm thinking of building another, and certainly open for video 
card suggestions within the 'utility' price range.
