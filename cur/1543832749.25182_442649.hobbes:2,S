Nokia.
Maybe they've changed the BABA magic, or the checksum logic entirely,
to prevent other software than their own OS from running.

You're completely sure that the EEPROM check is correct for this
particular revision of this particular chip?
(Do you happen to know where the EEPROM is located, by the way?
 Just out of interest.
 I can spot the three Intel chips but not the EEPROM.

They've been used in production environments for years.

Yes.
Perhaps an "ignorechecksum" switch would be appropriate.
I'd like to hear from anyone else who has IP130s and are experiencing
this problem (or isn't!).
