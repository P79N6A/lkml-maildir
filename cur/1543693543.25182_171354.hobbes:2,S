Dear Friends,
I want to read CPU Usage like top command.
What I want is read CPU usage for particular user log in.
Say x,y and z are logged in and they are running separate applications.
What I want is to get the CPU usage of each user separately.
It would be somewhat like top command, but then top gives CPU usage of the 
machine as a total.
Can anyone help me with giving me any clue about C apis in Linux.
Or if I can get the source code of top command.
Thanks
