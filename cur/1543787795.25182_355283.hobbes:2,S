I am still investigating the problem. I am not planning on resting right
now. I really want to understand what's going on with this system.
Too bad that I am quite naïve and don't understand much about hardware
in general. :-(

Humm, I think that I may have seen something like this in the past: I
have two CD readers here (both with DMA turned on) and I was once
extracting audio to be converted to MP3 and I noticed one strange
corruption that I have not been able to reproduce again:
Bits of what was extracted from one file appeared in the other disc and
the result was something like a mix of static and alternation between
the two music sources. Weird, huh?
Thanks for the concern, Rogério Brito.
P.S.: I will reboot my system and force an fsck as soon as I can, just
in case.
