	 Thanks Riley, 
	 The switch unit I have is electronic so there are no contacts to
clean...  I am curious though as to how to resurrect my keyboard and text
mode drivers from a telnet session since the machine is ok otherwise (if
that is possible) if not its no trouble to reboot, I just like to see high
uptimes:).  
	As for ml.org  check out 
http://www.dhs.org/
  they have taken over
the ml.org domain for a time to allow people to reconfigure their network.
The list replies to emails from that machine with the following:
   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
<linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu>
   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
... while talking to vger.rutgers.edu.:
<<< 553-We reject your network
<<< 553-If you feel we mistreat you, do contact us.
<<< 553 Ask HELP for our contact information.
	I did contact the list owner about this, but with no response
	mark
