Mostly shared with the other apps, you did remember to divide each page
by the number of users ?

Actually there is probably not enough information in /proc to do the
maths on it. The kernel itself has a clear idea which vma's are not
backed by ram in the usual sense as they are marked VM_IO.

So my X server is 1Mb larger because I can run networked apps and play
bzflag. Suits me as a tradeoff - I'm not saying it always is the right
decision - nanogui works well in restricted environments like video
recorders for example.
