if it's not possible, why do we have a piece of docs that claims there is any
difference between 2.1/2.2. For that matter, why was 2.2.0 not 2.1.133? Besides,
the idea of debugging code by running it till it dies is inherently flawed.
[The old adage: if architects built buildings like programmers write programs, the
first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization. Fortunately, that's not
yet true :-)]

I was pointing out that the vast majority of ur joe average's actually use
binary distributions built for them by somebody else. They have neither the
knowledge nor the inclination to build their own. That is how redhat makes
money.  besides, rpm --rebuild sucks.  can't split it up intelligently into
little stages. For eg, ncurses-4.2 does not rebuild cleanly after installing
glibc-2.1. You have to be more intelligent about it. Which is the problem. You
can't expect everybody to keep figuring out what went wrong where after they
rebuilt their supposedly stable kernel. If somebody finds that fun, they run
the development kernels.
[ The ncurses was just a random example. I don't blame anybody for it. I fully
realize that glibc-2.1 is still a development version. ]

Look, I don't run NT because it sucks. I don't want linux descending to that level.

duh? The MIT athena project has been around since the '80s. It's not going to go
away anytime soon. Why should it? It's far easier to dump linux in favour of netbsd,
which is also `OSS', as you put it.
Besides, what would you do with all those sources? You have any idea how much time
it takes to rebuild a server? Or worse, try to figure out which bits need rebuilding
and which don't? And in an environment where the maximum downtime acceptable is 0?

duh? You seriously believe that? nothing is better than something?
