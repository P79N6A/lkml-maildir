I never said you *wrote* st_rdev, did I?
You confirmed a statement about st_rdev - that's called "talking about
it". The fact that you didn't intend to or how obvious that is is
irrelevant in this context: you *did talk* about st_rdev and there's no
way you can deny or erase that.
But here comes the classic twist: instead of acknowledging your mistake,
you place the blame on everybody else for not guessing you were talking
about something else. This is not a rational behavior, please stop.
