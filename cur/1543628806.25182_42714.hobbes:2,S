You're right! I tried to point out before that my system had ignored the
keyboard since about the time of 2.5.7/2.5.8, but it didn't occur to me that
the problem could be ACPI related. Indeed, after compiling 2.5.10-dj1 (2.5.10
vanilla barfs an oops at me upon boot) w/ ACPI support turned off, I found
the system perfectly responsive again -- both mouse and keyboard work.
Thus I dare assume it's highly probable that input support has been broken
for VIA chipset-based systems by the recent ACPI changes in 2.5.x.
Cheers,
