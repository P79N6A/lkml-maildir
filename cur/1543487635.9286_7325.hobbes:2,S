Hi,
  The NFSv2 protocol specifies that the maximum allowed rsize/wsize value
is 8k. Thus, the immediate answer to your qustion is 'No'.
NFSv3 allows for larger values, and is the reason why the
maximum is higher in Alan's patches (NFS_MAX_FILE_IO_BUFFER_SIZE
should have been set to 8192 in nfs_fs.h for joe user).
Unfortunately, the full NFSv3 client is not yet ready; it is under
development, and will hopefully appear in Linux 2.3.
Cheers,
  Trond
