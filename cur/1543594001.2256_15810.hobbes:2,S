Keith, it's probably much easier to just change arch/s390/Makefile
to link the S/390 drivers *after* all common drivers by moving
drivers/s390/io.o to $DRIVERS instead of $CORE_FILES.
This should fix this particular problem, and appears to be more
logical anyway.
We are just testing this change whether any other problem crop up;
if it's OK we'll send a patch ...
Mit freundlichen Gruessen / Best Regards
