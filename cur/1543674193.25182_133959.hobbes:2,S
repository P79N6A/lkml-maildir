Let's quote the example from rubini & corbet of the sbull block device
driver. The request function ends like so:
        spin_unlock_irq (&io_request_lock);
        spin_lock(&device->lock);
    /* Process all of the buffers in this (possibly clustered) request.  */
        do {
            status = sbull_transfer(device, req);
        } while (end_that_request_first(req, status, DEVICE_NAME));
        spin_unlock(&device->lock);
        spin_lock_irq (&io_request_lock);
        end_that_request_last(req);
    }
    device->busy = 0;
}
Notice that he runs end_that_request_first outside the io_request_lock
and end_that_request_last under the lock. Do you know which is right?
(if any :-).
And he takes a device lock before calling the "transfer" routine.
Yes, he's ok because his transfer function is trivial and doesn't
take the lock, but anyone following his recipe is heading for
trouble.
