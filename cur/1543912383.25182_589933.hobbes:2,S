Hi Jens,
 how exactely is the queue depth related to the max # of commands? I
ask, because with the 2.6.22 kernel the "maximum queue depth since
init" seems to be never higher than 16, even with much higher
outstanding commands. On a 2.6.19 kernel, maximum queue depth is much
higher, just a bit below "max # of commands since init".
[2.6.22]# cat /proc/driver/cciss/cciss0
cciss0: HP Smart Array 6i Controller
Board ID: 0x40910e11
Firmware Version: 2.76
IRQ: 51
Logical drives: 1
Max sectors: 2048
Current Q depth: 0
Current # commands on controller: 145
Max Q depth since init: 16
Max # commands on controller since init: 204
Max SG entries since init: 31
Sequential access devices: 0
[2.6.19] cat /proc/driver/cciss/cciss0
cciss0: HP Smart Array 6i Controller
Board ID: 0x40910e11
Firmware Version: 2.76
IRQ: 51
Logical drives: 1
Current Q depth: 0
Current # commands on controller: 0
Max Q depth since init: 197
Max # commands on controller since init: 198
Max SG entries since init: 31
Sequential access devices: 0
Cheers
Martin
