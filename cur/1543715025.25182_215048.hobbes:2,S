We've already got feature compatibility bits that can deal with this
sort of thing.  There are various other proposed incompatible features,
such as large inodes and dynamically placed metadata (eg. placing inode
tables into an inode "file"), too.  Rather than invent new names for
each combination of incompatible feature set, we're probably better off
just using the feature masks.
Cheers,
 Stephen
