No.  This thing is above the userspace interface and completely
independent.  Either a task is allowed, and then the request goes
through to the interface.  Or if it's not, the request is stopped
right there, and never reaches the userspace interface.

True.  I'll send a patch (they are documented in the README of the
fuse distribution).

I leave the decision to you ;)  It's a separate independent patch
already (fuse-nfs-export.patch).

Will follow up in Franks answer.
