Well, then we just do it on systems that do have support in their firmware.
For starters that would be: alpha,  sparc, sparc64, mips and hppa, possibly
arm and m68k as well. The  only architecture which really has problems with
this is  the PC  (not PS/2: they  have a  protected mode BIOS  as far  as i
know),  but that  should be  solveable  with some  ingenuity and  real-mode
callbacks... And i  wouldn't mind adding an  old 300-500 MB IDE  disk to my
servers  solely for  the  purpose of  capturing crash  dumps  if that  were
necessary.

Well,  but other  people have.  So IMHO  we should  add the  possibility of
generating kernel dumps  where possible. Just make it an  option, so people
feeling uncomfortable about it could disable it...
