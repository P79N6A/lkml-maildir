"mature for a few years" before what happens?  It becomes a fine
vintage, and everyone enjoys it?  Or it becomes a stinking pile of
decaying matter?  I don't understand what you are getting at here.

You can not determine "modem devices" by just listing tty devices.  tty
devices are tty devices, some of them can be acting like a modem (like a
ACM device) and others can just be a serial port connected to a modem.
If you have issues with how HAL works, talk to the developers of it.
It's a relativly new project, and they can use the help.  But please
realize that sysfs doesn't exist for the sole reason of HAL.  HAL was
created because sysfs enabled it to be created.
