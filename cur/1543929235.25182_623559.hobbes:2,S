It would be better to just audit the source for those. Outlawing
something which was previously legal without auditing the source
is bad.
Anyways, i suspect it would just lead to more people disabling
softlockup. I remember during some older stress testing it also
tended to explode regularly, so e.g. SUSE kernel rpms have it disabled.
That patch would probably make it worse.
