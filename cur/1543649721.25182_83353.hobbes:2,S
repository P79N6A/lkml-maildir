Does it panic, or just print out a lot of the traces?  
If it panics, then you were able to chew through 7.5K of stack while it
warned during the last 3.5k.  Could you give us an idea of what was
being called?  Something like "a bunch of ACPI routines" or "the same
function a bunch of times" would be very helpful.  For right now, just
turn the CONFIG_X86_STACK_CHECK config option off.
