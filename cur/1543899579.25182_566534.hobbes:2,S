First look at dmesg and see what it tells you. Second, if there is a 
slow device on the cable it will sometimes limit the speed of the disk. 
Alan Cox and God might know why, I don't.
Third, you can play with drive parameters with hdparm. *DANGEROUS* to do 
so, the man page says "needless and risky," but at least the older 
kernels truly sucked at guessing the correct speeds. Backups are advised 
if you do this, etc,etc.
