FYI, the "fix" to make Windows/2000/Professional survive more than
a day before requiring a low-level format and re-install of everything,
was to remove the second CPU from a 2 - CPU system that ran for two
years without errors under Linux. Linux may have a race-or two, but
it certainly does a very good job with SMP, something that M$ will
apparently never do.
Cheers,

                 Windows-2000/Professional isn't.
