And rwsem_down_write_failed seems to think it's getting the pointer in
%eax:
Dump of assembler code for function rwsem_down_write_failed:
0x08193599 <rwsem_down_write_failed+0>: push   %ebp
0x0819359a <rwsem_down_write_failed+1>: mov    %esp,%ebp
0x0819359c <rwsem_down_write_failed+3>: push   %ebx
0x0819359d <rwsem_down_write_failed+4>: mov    %eax,%ebx
0x0819359f <rwsem_down_write_failed+6>: sub    $0x10,%esp
0x081935a2 <rwsem_down_write_failed+9>: push   $0xffffffff
0x081935a4 <rwsem_down_write_failed+11>:        lea    0xffffffec(%ebp),%eax
0x081935a7 <rwsem_down_write_failed+14>:        push   %eax
0x081935a8 <rwsem_down_write_failed+15>:        push   %ebx
0x081935a9 <rwsem_down_write_failed+16>:        movl   $0x2,0xfffffff8(%ebp)
0x081935b0 <rwsem_down_write_failed+23>:        call   0x8193423 <rwsem_down_failed_common>
This is clearly taking something from %eax and something on the stack
(and a -1) and passing it to rwsem_down_failed_common, corresponding
to this:
	rwsem_down_failed_common(sem, &waiter,
				RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS - RWSEM_ACTIVE_BIAS);
So, this does look right to me.
