No, think of the following scenario:
- file I/O causes a read of an ext2 file's bitmap.  The bitmap is
  brought into /dev/hda1's pagecache using !__GFP_HIGHMEM
- references are released against that page and it's now just clean
  reclaimable pagecache
- someone (say, an online filesystem checker or something) mmaps
  /dev/hda1 and reads that page.
- migration comes alnog and migrates that page into highmem
- file I/O causes a read of that bitmap again.  We find it in
  /dev/hda's pagecache.
  Here's set_bh_page().
	void set_bh_page(struct buffer_head *bh,
			struct page *page, unsigned long offset)
	{
		bh->b_page = page;
		BUG_ON(offset >= PAGE_SIZE);
		if (PageHighMem(page))
			/*
			 * This catches illegal uses and preserves the offset:
			 */
			bh->b_data = (char *)(0 + offset);
		else
			bh->b_data = page_address(page) + offset;
	}
- ext2 now tries to access the bits in the bitmap via page->bh->b_data
- game over
