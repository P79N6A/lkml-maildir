Personally I prefer the #error. People with platforms which _don't_ yet
provide the underlying primitives which the XIP code needs will see the
option, turn it on and work out what they need to do. Otherwise, they'll
continue to be unaware that it even exists. 
I consider that to be more important than the case of someone who turns
it on when they don't actually want it.
