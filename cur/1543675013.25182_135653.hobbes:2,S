Perhaps not that weird. From my experience, ALi DMA is sensitive to
some of "PIO timings". That is, if SRM hasn't initialized the chipset
properly (on Nautilus it has, BTW), DMA won't work. When you boot with
DMA disabled, driver has to set right PIO mode, so you can safely
enable DMA later.
Can you (and Jason) try this patch with CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y?
Ivan.
