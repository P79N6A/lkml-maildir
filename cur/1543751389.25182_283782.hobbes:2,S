Ick, yeah, now I remember...

In measurements published on linux-usb-devel, pure userspace calls using
the current usbfs code generated almost full bandwidth usage (within the
hardware limits).  So adding the scatter-gather api interface to usbfs
wouldn't really provide that much benefit.
And, we can always use help in designing such an API, if you could find
someone at your company to help us out in doing so... :)
