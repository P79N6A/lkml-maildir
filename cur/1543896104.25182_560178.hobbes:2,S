Tested, except for the compile error already reported it does its job on
my vaios.
A question though:

is it really necessary to have those duplicate entries?
Also, I guess that when this patch set is applied we also should declare
sonypi obsolete as sony-laptop will grab the same device that sonypi
wants (the SPIC one). sony-laptop has options to avoid doing that would
make things clear to users.
I still haven't received reports of mafunctioning vaios using the new
sony-laptop instead of sonypi but 2.6.22 isn't final yet.
