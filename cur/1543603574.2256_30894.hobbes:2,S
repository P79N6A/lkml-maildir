Subject: alpha 2.4.11-pre3: delay disabling early boot messages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

>From Jay Estabrook:
Alpha has this nice way to output console messages via SRM callbacks
which we can enable immediately on bootup, and so get debugging output
before console_init.  This patch delays when we turn that off, and so
narrows the window in which we can't get debug output.
