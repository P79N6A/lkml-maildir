I've observed mysterious behaviour from 2.2.14's bsd_comp when connected
to $LARGE_NETWORKING_VENDOR's dial access gateway.  After 30-60 minutes
use, it started to drop packets, and it seemed to be based on byte
intervals.
So a `ping -s64 remotehost' would drop every fourth packet.  `ping -s128
remotehost' would drop every second packet, etc.  The packets were
dropped locally.
After several days swearing at this I disabled bsd_comp and all was
sweetness and light.
