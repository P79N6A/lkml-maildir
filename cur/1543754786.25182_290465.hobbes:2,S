Btw, since you're clearly at the keyboard now: I do agree with Christoph
that it would be a lot cleaner to just say that all architectures have to
have a arch_align_stack() define, instead of having a
__HAVE_ARCH_ALIGN_STACK define.
After all, a trivial implementation would apparently just be
	#define arch_align_stack(x) (x)
which is not too much of a bother to maintain for an architecture that 
doesn't want to do this ;)
