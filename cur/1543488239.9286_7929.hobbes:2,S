This is exactly the problem I've lived with for over a year.... can anyopne 
explain it to me?
> First problem:
> 
>   I have a sb 16 vibra sound card.
>   I let the BIOS configure the IRQ and dma channels as
>   suggested in the docs.
>   BIOS states in the booting messages that
>   the IRQ is 5 and the DMA channels are 1 and 0.
> 
>   Only when I use 0 as second DMA channel, /dev/dsp
>   is working.
> 
>   In the booting process I get the following message:
> 
>     SB16: Bad or missing 16 bit DMA channel
> 
>   I found this message in sb_common.c in an if statement:
> 
>     if (hv_config->dma2 < 5 || hw_config->dma2 > 7)
> 
>   In the same if statement devc->dma16 is set to devc->dma8

>   Does this mean that: The BIOS assigned 0 (Zero) as

>   If I do not use IRQ 5 and DMA channels 1 and 0 the /dev/dsp
>   device is not useable.
