Apart from that, dummy ;)  The absolute numbers are proportional
to IO bandwidth.  And 7/8ths of a scsi disk per CPU isn't much.

Well shrink_list() runs locklessly now.  But there remains a significant
cost in shrink_cache(), a little of which will be due to the hopefully-removable
page_cache_get() inside the lock.
