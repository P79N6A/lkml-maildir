Since when is this *your* code?  Oh that's right, when Jiri decided  
to steal it by deleting Reyk's copyright and license.  Oh wait,  
that's already been corrected.  What was your point again?

The BSD license, in effect, says that we care about good code.  We  
allow anyone to use it.  The only stipulation is that the copyright  
and license permissions must remain intact.
Are you trying to be hateful, or are you really this ignorant?
