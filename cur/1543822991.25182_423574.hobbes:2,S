Hi,
Sorry for the slow response, I've had a lot of work to do recently.

I think the main problem with the patch was that the criterion by which
the pages were included in the image without copying appeared to be too simple
and therefore too general.  It well might be correct, but that's yet to be
shown.  OTOH it probably is possible to use a criterion that everybody will
agree with.  For example, we could chose pages that would be reclaimed if
there were memory pressure (the pages with I/O operations pending should
not belong to this class).

That's true, but I only measured the short-time effect of the suspend on the
system responsiveness.
Apart from this without the patch swsusp tends to leave quite o lot
of data in the swap and IMO this effect should not be neglected.  Currently we
only have a very general idea about what these data are and why it happens
actually and there's no warranty it wouldn't hamper performance in the
long run.

Still my experience indicates that it doesn't play very nice with swsusp and
unfortunately it hogs the I/O.
