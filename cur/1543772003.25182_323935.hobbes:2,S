I have not.  My keyboard and mouse (on a hub) are plugged in beside the
kaweth device so they would be on the same interrupt.
I did notice that the kaweth file itself hasn't changed, but something is
different between rc3 and rc4.
Someone else asked what host controllers.  I tried it on 2 systems.  The
device itself is USB1.  One machine running rc5 used Intel 440bx chipset. 
I'm not sure what controller it has but I was using the onboard USB which
uses uhci.  I don't have that machine anymore, it was temporary.  I'm
currently using this on an Intel E7505 chipset which uses both ehci and uhci
(loaded in that order)
I used the same configfile from rc2 when I compiled rc3 and rc4 (doing make
old config of course).  I'll see about testing this later on.  I don't have
time this morning to look at this.
