You exaggerate. Windows drivers work well enough in Windows (or so I 
presume). One just has to implement the environment these drivers 
expect, very carefully.
For the untrusting, options do remain:
- run the driver in userspace (if it's a xorg driver, in a separate 
process) so that all outputs can be validated
- use binary translation even on x86 and validate all memory and I/O 
accesses (like valgrind, but hopefully faster)
It's still possible for the driver to dma stuff where it shouldn't. 
Maybe IOMMU games (where available) can help. But I seriously doubt it 
will be that bad.
