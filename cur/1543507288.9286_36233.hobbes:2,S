This sounds in effect the same as no-emulation booting where you get
access via int 13 as well. The only difference is that different int 13
calls are used thus requiring a thin translation layer in the kernel for
no-emulation. I didn't know about the hard drive emulation. Sounds
simpler.
So why do all these Linux distributions insist on doing their CD booting
using steam-driven technology? Think of how neat it could be! Admittedly
it would work on a slightly smaller set of hardware, but it would serve
the majority of x86 users.
