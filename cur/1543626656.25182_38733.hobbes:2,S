I've got an ESS 1969 which on occasion (very often, almost every other 
track) just plays back a high pitched screeching noise, while at the same 
time playing at an accelerated rate. It doesn't sound like the music 
playing accelerated because the pitch remains constant. I've also noticed 
that the interrupts generated by the card increase (enough to actually 
slow down any devices sharing). Any tips/pointers on where to start 
looking would be appreciated.
Thanks,
