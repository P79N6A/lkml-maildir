Personally when I built an embedded LFS for a customer, I wrote a dummy "arch" 
and "uname" and then bootstrapped the 32bit LFS book, then built a cross 
compiler with the CLFS book and built a 64bit kernel. Seemed to work okay.
However, there isn't 100% compatibility in a 64bit kernel for all syscalls, I 
think one of the VFAT syscall wrappers is currently broken.
[ 5807.639755] ioctl32(war3.exe:4998): Unknown cmd fd(9) cmd(82187201){02} 
arg(00221000) on /home/alistair/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Warcraft III
Other than that, I've had no problem with running a purely 32bit userspace.
