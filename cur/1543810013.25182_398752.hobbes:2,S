I'm sorry for omitting that information in my previous mail.

Consider me your happy and willing patch test victim :-)
I can easily reproduce data corruption with sata_mv.
FWIW, I like this card very much. It is cheap, seems to perform well,
and Marvell seems to be Linux friendly, providing the docs (according to
http://linux-ata.org/sata-status.html#marvell
).
I'm not subscribed to linux-ide, but am to linux-kernel. If you post it
there (or cc me) I'll see and try it.
