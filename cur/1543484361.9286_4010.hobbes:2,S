I've got a machine running 2.2.1 (PPro200, Buslogic Flashpoint LW, Seagate
UW HDD, 3c905) exhibiting some rather odd behavior. Every once in a while,
it will send a SCSI bus reset (it happened once when I was un-tar-ing a
file). When it does, it seems to break the machine altogether, especially 
TTY support (as spawning new shells and logging in are the first to go).
The machine still pings and serves web pages without a problem.
(Correction, it slowly degenerates until it cannot serve pages anymore,
like system resources are slowly being consumed and not freed.) However, I
cannot SSH into it, nor can I scp stuff off of it. (SSH stops at the
"Requesting pty." message.) I tried opening telnet and telnetting in when
this happens to no avail. In fact, I can't even get a response from the
console; it allows me to type in my username, but never asks me for my
password. Occasionally, it just opens the connection and sits there,
twiddling its thumbs. Apparently, it cannot spawn any processes or
something.
There is no oops involved, no console messages (short of the SCSI Bus
reset message). I am *not* using Unix98 PTY stuff.
Is this a known problem? What else could I try? Thanks!
