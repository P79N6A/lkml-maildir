If you pursued it, wouldn't your patch also need to change
nr_free_buffer_pages() to do what you think it does, count
the free lowmem pages?  It, and nr_free_pagecache_pages(),
and nr_free_zone_pages(), are horribly badly named.  They
count present_pages-pages_high, they don't count free pages:
okay for initialization estimates, useless for anything dynamic.
