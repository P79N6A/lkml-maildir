I'm using an older motherboard.  But, the same chipset.

I have a similar problem here.  But, I usually just use a highres text mode :)

I had this - when I only had 1024k of video ram.
The weird thing, that I found was that it works on some bootups, but not others.  But more often than not, it doesn't work right.  I also found that running dosemu like: "dos -V", seems to usually make it work, until the next bootup.
So, it sounds like the problem can be fixed by getting a new video card.  S3 Trio64's are slow, anyway.
