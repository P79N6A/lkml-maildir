It won't uncharge for the memory controller from the root cgroup since each page
 has the mem_cgroup information associated with it. For other controllers,
they'll need to monitor exit() callbacks to know when the leader is dead :( (sigh).
Not having the group leader optimization can introduce big overheads (consider
thousands of tasks, with the group leader being the first one to exit).
