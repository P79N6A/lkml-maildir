Evgeniy, it's things like the following that make it very draining
mentally to review your work.
>  * removed AIO stuff from patchset
You didn't really do this, you leave the aio_* syscalls and stubs in
there, and you also left things like tcp_async_send() in there.
All the foo_naio_*() stuff is still in there to.
Please remove all of async business we've asked you to.
Thanks.
