Looks like when you said "CPU memory barrier extends to all memory
references" you were probably referring to a _given_ CPU ... yes,
that statement is correct in that case.

Well, why not. Callers who don't want/need any guarantees whatsoever
can still use __foo() -- for others, it makes sense to just use
foo() and get *both* the compiler and CPU barrier semantics -- I think
that's the behaviour most callers would want anyway.
