I'm not familiar with the NIC driver, but this problem really is
annoying. The gurus, please consider a solution. It's not an uncommon
case. I believe it's common in a big system with hotplug support. I can
understand why the driver doesn't support more than 32 a card, but one
card with 32 times hotplug failed is a little ugly.
