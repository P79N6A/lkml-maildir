Can you prove "Under all uses, circumstances and code requirements we  
will do fine with 4K stacks today and tomorrow" ? How will deeply  
nested function calls, longer call chains etc. be solved by kmalloc()?

My point wasn't that reducing stack will make code much more complex.  
My point was some type of functionality might validly require complex  
code which requires more stack - there are capable and affordable  
machines to solve such problems and all we are doing with 4kB stacks  
is that preventing it.
Again - what is the pressing need to remove the "8Kb Stack _Option_"?  
What problem does it solve on 64 bit arches?
