Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 10, 2005 at 07:45:12PM CEST, I got a letter

It turns out to be the forks for doing all the cuts and such what is
bogging it down so awfully (doing diff-tree takes 0.48s ;-). I do about
15 forks per change, I guess, and for some reason cut takes a long of
time on its own.
I've rewritten the cuts with the use of bash arrays and other smart
stuff. I somehow don't feel comfortable using this and prefer the
old-fashioned ways, but it would be plain unusable without this.
Now I'm down to
	real    1m21.440s
	user    0m32.374s
	sys     0m42.200s
and I kinda doubt if it is possible to cut this much down. Almost no
disk activity, I have almost everything cached by now, apparently.
Anyway, you can git pull to get the optimized version.
Thanks for the help,

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
