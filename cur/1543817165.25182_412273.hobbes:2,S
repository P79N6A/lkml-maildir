Form semantical point of view, the forms:
	bit_foo(..., mode)
and
	bit_foo_mode(...)
are equivalent.
However, I do not think your implementation would be efficient due to
selecting the ordering mode at run time:

etc.
In addition, we may want to inline these primitives...
A compile-time selection of the appropriate code sequence would help.
Thanks,
