[Sorry for the late response, I haven't been keeping up on lkml lately.]
ia64 has basically the same situation.  I decided it was a mistake to
have the arch code register serial ports early, because we only learn
about a few of the ports early, and the firmware console configuration
determines which ones we learn about.
The consequence is that changing the firmware configuration changes the
serial device names, which I thought was a bad thing.
I finally settled on this scheme:
	- discover default firmware port (pcdp.c)
	- set it up as an "early uart" which has no ttyS name
	  and runs in polled mode (early_serial_console_init())
	- register it as a console
	- let 8250_{pci,pnp,etc} discover all the ports and
	  figure out minor numbers (i.e., ttyS names)
	- locate the port that matches the default firmware port,
	  switch console to it, and unregister the "early uart"
	  (early_uart_console_switch())
This all should work for any arch, though I've only really tried it on
ia64.  Of course, the pcdp.c part would have to be replaced.  You can
try it out without the firmware support using the "console=uart"
argument:
        console=        [KNL] Output console device and options.
        ...
                uart,io,<addr>[,options]
                uart,mmio,<addr>[,options]
                        Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
                        UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address,
                        switching to the matching ttyS device later.  The
                        options are the same as for ttyS, above.
