This should be a non-issue in my opinion.  My team runs a bunch of
production Linux servers at my university job.  Here is rpm output
from one of our servers:
rpm -qa:
Base-1.3-4
Kernel-2.0.35-3
Networking-1.0-24
Kerberos-1.0.5-5
Kernel_Static-2.0.36-1
rpm -q Kernel_Static -l:
/boot
/boot/vm2.0.36-1
/boot/vm2.0.36-1.config
/boot/vm2.0.36-1.map
Kernels don't get installed unless they are packed like above.  This
doesn't have the advantage of the information being physically stuck
but I'm not sure if I see the advantage to that.
