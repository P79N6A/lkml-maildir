This may be a stupid question, but how can I set a gray background colour in
Linux?
I am running kernel 2.2.3
If i use echo -e "\033[30;1m" I end up with a gray foreground, but if I do
echo -e "\033[40;1m" I end up with black b/g bright white f/g.
I can set all the 'bright' foreground colours as follows:
  echo -e "\033[30;1m" = Gray
  echo -e "\033[31;1m" = Bright Red (Pink)
  echo -e "\033[32;1m" = Bright Green
  echo -e "\033[33;1m" = Yellow
  echo -e "\033[34;1m" = Bright Blue
  echo -e "\033[35;1m" = Bright Magenta
  echo -e "\033[36;1m" = Bright Cyan
  echo -e "\033[37;1m" = Bright White
but if I try these for the background:
  echo -e "\033[40;1m" = Black b/g Bright White f/g
  echo -e "\033[41;1m" = Red 
  echo -e "\033[42;1m" = Green
  echo -e "\033[43;1m" = Brown
  echo -e "\033[44;1m" = Blue
  echo -e "\033[45;1m" = Magenta
  echo -e "\033[46;1m" = Cyan
  echo -e "\033[47;1m" = White
I get the base colours, not the 'bright' version of them.
Hope somebody can help.
Thanks,
Rob.
