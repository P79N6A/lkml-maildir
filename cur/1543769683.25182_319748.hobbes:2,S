It is expected that each pin can potentually be engaged by a device inserted into the corresponding PCI slot. However, this imposes severe limitation on systems that have designs that employ many  I/O APICs, only utilizing couple lines of each, such as P64H2 chipset. It is used in ES7000, and currently, there is no way to boot the system with more that 9 I/O APICs. The simple change below allows to boot a system with say 64 (or more) I/O APICs, each providing 1 slot, which otherwise impossible because of the IRQ gaps created for unused lines on each I/O APIC. It does not resolve the problem with number of devices that exceeds number of possible IRQs, but eases up a tension for IRQs on any large system with potentually large number of devices. I only implemented this for the ACPI boot, since if the system is this big and

The patch works for both i386 and x86_64 archs. It works with MSIs just fine, and should not intervene with implementations like shared vectors, when they get worked out and incorporated.

Thanks. Looks good to me and makes a lot of sense.
Eventually the non ACPI case will need to be fixed too. At least
on some distributions there are "failsafe" boot loader entries
which disable ACPI, and users tend to use them occasionally
and get unhappy when they dont work.
