This is a myth. RAM survives rebooting, even after a quick power cycle
most cells will probably still be ok. And with todays memory sizes, it
would take a noticable amount of time to initialize all of it to a given
value, so most systems don't do it (just testing some bytes of every
megabyte instead).
