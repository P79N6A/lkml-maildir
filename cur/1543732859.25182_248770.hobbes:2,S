It seemed really usefull in uservfs incarnation. Unfortunately the
daemon was not multihreaded at that time, so it was not really usefull
on multiuser systems :-(

Well, you'd need more than simple open. For caching tar (etc), you'd
need stat_cached_view and opendir_cached_view and ...
And this really works, only that its called mc_open(), mc_stat() etc.
Gnome actually uses newer incarnation of mc_open etc, but they had to
introduce rather ugly interface to make it asynchronous.
