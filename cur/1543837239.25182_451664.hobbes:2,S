Eeesh, because on SMP,  alloc_alien_cache returns 0x01020304 instead of
NULL, And it returns 0x01020304 because CPU_UP_PREPARE fails if
alloc_alien_cache returns NULL.  NUMA and non NUMA slab should be able to
work even without alien caches, currently that doesn't seem to be the case.
We are working on that.  In the meanwhile, the following patch should
fix the oops due to locdep annotation.
Thanks,
Kiran
Fix oops due to alien cache locdep annotation on non NUMA configurations.
A plain alien != NULL won't work as l3->alien is initialized with
0x01020304ul
