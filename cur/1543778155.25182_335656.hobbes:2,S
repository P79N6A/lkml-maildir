I think this one is good enough:
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    void *p;
    unsigned size = 1<<20;
    unsigned long total=0;
    while(size) {
        p = malloc(size);
        if(!p) size>>=1;
        else {
            memset(p, 0x77, size);
            total+=size;
            printf("Allocated %9u bytes, %12lu total\n",size,total);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
You may want to adapt it so that it takes an argument now many megabytes
to eat before it dies.
