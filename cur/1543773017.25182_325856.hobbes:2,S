Ok, thanks.
I thought it was intended to be more general than that - in fact I
specifically thought it was not intended to be purely for single machine
authentication decisions within a single kernel module, but that anything
which would aid in enabling new security features, locally or remotely,
would be game.  (Which - it means nothing - but I would clearly have
preferred :)
Thanks for setting me straight.
