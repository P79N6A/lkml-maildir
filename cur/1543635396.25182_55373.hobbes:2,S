Eh?  I do an fchmod() on a readonly descriptor, then I call fsync()
on that descriptor.  The inode gets sync'd to disk (with updated mode
and c_time).  So no, I don't need a writable descriptor to call fsync().
The only question is *what* gets sync'd when I call fsync() on an O_RDONLY
file-descriptor.
SUSv3 (
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/fsync.html
)
says "The fsync() function forces all currently queued I/O
operations associated with the file indicated by file descriptor fildes
to the synchronised I/O completion state."
It appears from this wording that the file-descriptor is *merely* a
handle referring to the inode, and that *all* outstanding I/O on the
inode [within the "system"] is performed. In other words, if I had
several different file handles referring to the same inode (but
different kernel "struct file" objects), all inode data and meta-data
updates prior to the fsync() call would be synchronized.  It doesn't
say that explicitly, but given the usual visibility rules regarding
writes, etc., that is the "natural" interpretation. [Caveat: mmap()]
To state it succinctly: if other (data or meta-data) writes are visible to 
the process doing the fsync(), they need to be sync'd too.
In the case of directories, there is no file handle "doing the writing" --
the kernel does that, so absent the ability to call fsync() on a readonly
handle to a directory, i.e. fsync(dirfd(dir)), there is no convenient way to sync
the directory contents.  Calling fsync() on every file in a directory
does not necessitate syncing the directory!
