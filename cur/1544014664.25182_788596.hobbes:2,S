Ok, I pulled this, because I really do want the boot speedups and the 
previous version missed the last merge window, but after booting it, I 
started to worry:
My dmesg shows:
 [    2.264955] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
 [    2.264958]  sdb:<6>Freeing unused kernel memory: 408k freed
Ouch. How come that "Freeing unused kernel memory" got done in the middle 
of the sdb partition thing?
There's a async_synchronize_full() there before the free_initmem(), but 
I'm worrying that it just isn't working. Hmm? What am I missing?
