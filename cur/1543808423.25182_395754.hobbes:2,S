OK I see. This can be solved with this patch :
[PATCH] HOTPLUG_CPU : avoid hitting too many cachelines in recalc_bh_state()
Instead of using for_each_cpu(i), we can use for_each_online_cpu(i) : The 
difference matters if HOTPUG_CPU=y
When a CPU goes offline (ie removed from online map), it might have a non null 
bh_accounting.nr, so this patch adds a transfert of this counter to an online 
CPU counter.
We already have a hotcpu_notifier, (function buffer_cpu_notify()), where we 
can do this bh_accounting.nr transfert.
