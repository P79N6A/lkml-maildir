I agree, but who says, that the buffer always has to be the main memory?
That might be true especially for embedded devices. The cpu is then just
the local controller, that manages several devices with its own buffer.
Let's take a file server with multiple disks and multiple network cards
with it's own buffer. For stuff like this you don't want to go through the
main memory, on the other hand you still need to synchronize all the data.
Although I don't know such hardware, but I don't see a reason not to do it
under Linux. :-)
bye, Roman
