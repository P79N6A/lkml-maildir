Actually I did it the same way. I have no info about the output on boot.

Interesting. Even after a dmesg -c -s 1000000 it contains only the end
of the story. This is the beginning of the dmesg output:
rusalka:~% dmesg | head
input.c: Mapping: Consumer.0230 ---> IGNORED
[85080.775297] drivers/hid/hid-input.c: Mapping: Consumer.0231 ---> IGNORED
[85080.775302] drivers/hid/hid-input.c: Mapping: Consumer.0232 ---> IGNORED
[85080.775308] drivers/hid/hid-input.c: Mapping: Consumer.0233 ---> Key.ScrollUp
[85080.775314] drivers/hid/hid-input.c: Mapping: Consumer.0234 --->
Key.ScrollDown
So the first line is corrupted. In the remaining of the output
(total=220 lines) I cannot see the evidence of corruption.
