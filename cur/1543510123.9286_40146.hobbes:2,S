The common interface wouldn't have to try to use every feature of the ACLs in the
underlying filesystem.  Even a least-common-demoninator interface would be much
better than nothing.  Maybe restrict to directory ACLs only,  etc.
Another option would be to write some massively intelligent userspace library that
could query the filesystem and divine the correct way to do things. Not something
I'd want to try to debug, verify to be correct and secure, or maintain though ...
