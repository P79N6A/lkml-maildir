Only if there's another method to retrieve all filesystems mounted from 
userspace from the kernel. Though this may not be your view of things it 
is the only way to ensure that one gets a valid mount list. And as 
/proc/mounts is an interface to userspace it is my opinion that in 
kernel private mounts that can't be modified from userspace don't need 
to be listed there. Not my decision, anyway.
