Donald, is there a clean way to patch your tulip driver into the kernel (2.3.52
and up) now that there are numerous files involved?
The tulip driver in the kernel has several issues (different machines):
  - locks up requiring link state down/up
  - has a one shot link state up, requires module to be removed/re-inserted or
rebooted to cycle the link state
  - randomly kills the machine dead without any OOPS for debug
I'm leaving PCMCIA issues out of this for the moment.  Can we get a tarball
release of your tulip driver now or if you give me guidance, I'll write up an
html page with the necessary instructions for swapping back and forth?
-d
p.s. yes, Donald -does- actively work on drivers, anyone who pays attention knows
this.
