Nothing I've read about MSI so far indicates that an IRQ number greater 
than 255 is permissible, yet this device gets assigned an IRQ number of 
8,410 when MSI is enabled.  Booting 2.6.18-rc5-mm1 with pci=nomsi causes 
the device to be assigned IRQ 17 instead of 8410.
The problem with the large IRQ number is made manifest in Fedora's 
irqbalance program, which is run as an init script.  An array is built 
in that program that's indexed by IRQ number, with a max of 255.  When 
the program attempts to index element 8410, it segfaults.
Are IRQ numbers greater than 255 allowed with MSI?
