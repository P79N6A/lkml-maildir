Hmmm, for some reason I thought we had it, but it's been a non-issue for a
long time. The ECN thing hasn't bitten me yet either, happily.
So the question then becomes what is the process whereby we decide that
Linux will follow standards that are known to silently break things in a
large part of the real world. We explicitly don't do this with a user's
hardware, and I think we have other work-arounds for network
interoperability. How big and how badly does something have to break
before it becomes something we work around?
