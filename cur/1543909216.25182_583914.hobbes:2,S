I second this thought (keeping MAINTAINERS info closer to code than in
a central kernel-global location), but have a differing opinion about the
implementation. Having MAINTAINERS-style annotations in all source files
sounds needlessly redundant. Worse still, I expect people will avoid adding
these annotations to all source files precisely for this reason, thus
someone editing drivers/xxx/foo.c would have no idea that the maintainer
info for this file is actually in drivers/xxx/bar.c.
Better solution is to have multiple MAINTAINERS files distributed in the
kernel tree, IMHO -- say a drivers/net/MAINTAINERS for maintainer info on
all various net drivers, drivers/kvm/MAINTAINERS for KVM maintainer info,
fs/ext3/MAINTAINERS for ext3 maintainers, fs/MAINTAINERS for generic VFS
maintainers info, so on and so forth. Of course, these individual
MAINTAINERS files could still have the newly-introduced "F:" fields as
well (drivers/net/MAINTAINERS would clearly require it, f.e.) ...
