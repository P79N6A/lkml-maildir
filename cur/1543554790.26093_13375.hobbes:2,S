Oh, I missed one point: we need to handle the swapout of nonattached
pages: in shm you can detach the last user and the segment with
content is still around. So we have to scan the shm objects themselves
also. Should We could do this in the same loop as we scan the mm's?
Also we have to make sure to derefence the swap entry if the last
reference is in the shm segmant table .
