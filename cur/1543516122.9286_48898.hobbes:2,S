Hi,
I saw the changes in recent 2.3 kernels, ISA memory is not longer mapped
to the same logical address, as the physical was. OK, no problem.
Here are new functions to access ISA memory (e.g. isa_readb) to
access it without knowing the logical address.
My question:
What 'll be the better way to rewrite ISA drivers:
- using the "isa_..." functions
- or get the logical address via ioremap and use the normal memory
  access functions
?
