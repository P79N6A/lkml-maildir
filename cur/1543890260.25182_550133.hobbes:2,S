Well, that really depends.
I think the only thing that must not be written to disk is filesystem stuff.
The other things (eg. writing directly to block devices etc.) doesn't hurt us.
Also, I think that DMA-ing while we're creating the image should be impossible
due to devices being frozen at that point.
That said, I think we need to write some better freezer documentation ASAP.
