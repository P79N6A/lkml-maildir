The some objections against it (in vein: most people who want to
read it, supposed to want write into it).
But as for now it seems to be the only reason to have it readable
(and such things as /proc/ide/ideN/hdX/settings) is pure curiousity:
i don't really like to bother usually overworked admin to look at the
prof_cpu_mask just to figure out why all interrupts handled by CPU0.
And he is supposed to deny any my attempts to get root-SUID cat :)
