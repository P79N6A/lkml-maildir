Subject: [PATCH] reduce size of bio mempools
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The biovec default mempool limit of 256 entries results in over 3MB of RAM 
being permanently pinned, even on systems with only 128MB of RAM.  Since 
mempool tries to allocate from the system pool first, it makes sense to 
reduce the size of the mempool fallbacks to a more reasonable limit of 1-5 
entries -- enough for the system to be able to make progress even under 
load.
