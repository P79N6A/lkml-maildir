art -
One more followup question. Was the file system you're using converted from a
v3.5 file system, or has it always been v3.6?
Sergey Vlasov on the reiserfs list noticed that v3.5 objects never had
REISERFS_I(inode)->i_attrs set, which means that even on a converted v3.6
file system, objects created underneath a v3.5-created directory would
inherit random attrs bits.
I have a patch that adds an additional check to see if the file system has
always been v3.6 - just by checking the version of the stat data on the root
directory.
If you haven't already run reiserfsck --clean attributes, can you give the
patch a try? Don't mount with -oattrs, since we already know the attributes
are corrupt. I just want to test and see if the file system you've got is
converted from a v3.5 file system and if it fixes the problem.
Thanks.
