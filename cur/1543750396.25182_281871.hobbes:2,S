I'm having that problem, although I didn't with 2.6.7. I'll grab the 
latest BIOS, I have the P4P800 installed, and a P4P800-E deluxe in the 
box with CPU and parts to make it work. Just no particular need for 
another system at this instant.
I think it *may* be related to the VIA RAID controller, although I 
haven't had time to do reboots to see, since I'm trying to get the 
*&*^%&^% i810 audio into 4 channel mode at the moment, which I need more 
than 2.6.
Actually, until 2.6 will use the VIA controller I can't run it full time 
anyway.
