NAK.
These functions do insertions differently.  The 'prev' is pointing to
the last valid descriptor in the queue and you really want to get the
new_chain stuck on after this.  Your list_splice_tail() will insert the
new_chain just before it which will muck up the order of the DMA
requests.
You might have more success with
	list_splice_tail(&new_chain, ioat_chan->used_desc);
where used_desc points to the whole list, rather than using the .prev
pointer to a specific node.
Please copy me on future ioatdma related comments.
Thanks,
