They were in the correct order, and I did number them.
The commit with the invalid commit ID in question went in a long time
ago, into 2.6.23 in fact, and as I explained in another email I
rebased by net-2.6 tree before I had sent that patch in, but I forgot
to update the commit log in these PCI layer changes.
I was not referencing a commit ID within the PCI patch set itself.
I just did a pull and verified that the commits are in the correct
order.
For reference the commit I meant to reference was:

    [TG3]: Workaround MSI bug on 5714/5780.
    A hardware bug was revealed after a recent PCI MSI patch was made to
    always disable legacy INTX when enabling MSI.  The 5714/5780 chips
    will not generate MSI when INTX is disabled, causing MSI failure
    messages to be reported, and another patch was made to workaround the
    problem by disabling MSI on ServerWorks HT1000 bridge chips commonly
    found with the 5714.
    We workaround this chip bug by enabling INTX after we enable MSI and
    after we resume from suspend.
    Update version to 3.81.
    This problem was discovered by David Miller.
