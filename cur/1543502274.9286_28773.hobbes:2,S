I don't understand either of these. A library based approach stores
the entire compound document in one Unix file. That seems to satisfy
(a), and I don't understand (b) at all -- a compound document with a
single filename seems to be pretty good from and end-user point of view.

I haven't seen anyone propose 100 simple mechanisms. I proposed (1)
common library for applications, and (1) general kernel mechanism for
ACLs, because they're different and special, which might solve other
problems too.

I don't know. Remember that people have been thinking about these
issues for decades. I have done a lot of work with the Legion
distributed OS; it has plenty of ways to solve the issue of storing
compound stuff and metadata, but no good solution to cp causing a new
file to inherit the right stuff from an old file...
