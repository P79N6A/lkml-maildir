I found it necessary to add
#include <linux/module.h>
to 2.3.99pre2/ipc/shm.c in order for the kernel to compile. It was reporting
THIS_MODULE as undefined on line 142
static DECLARE_FSTYPE(shm_fs_type, "shm", shm_read_super, 0);
I do not believe this is the correct behaviour though, as the kernel
configuration
does not appear to allow modular SYSVIPC. 
I would appreciate any response as these are early days of kernel code
browsing ;-)
