What you did was bypass devfs, and cause create_dev to mknod a file
with the device number of your root instead of creating a symlink
to the normal devfs node.
Is your booter translating the device name into a number?  You can
check this by looking at the printed comand line in the dmesg, or
by cat /proc/cmdline .
If you see root=0304 then your booter is translating the device number
and therefore find_in_devfs is failing (possibly because of the previously
metioned patch to read_dir).
I notice that there are lots of hardcoded maxdepth of 64 characters for
the devfs path, but yours seems to be 39 and therefore should be ok.
