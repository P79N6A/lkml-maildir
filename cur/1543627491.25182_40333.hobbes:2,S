The kernel realised it was being made to sleep in an interrupt. If you
remove the check it will crash anyway. If you did something like
 	if(..... as before ...)
	{
		flags&=~SLAB_LEVEL_MASK;
		flags|=SLAB_ATOMIC;
		printk(KERN_ERR "kmem: critical memory allocation level error.\n");
	}
it ought to print a complaint and continue. Really however it wants fixing
