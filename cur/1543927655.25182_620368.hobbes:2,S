Memory barriers are memory barriers, regardless of what type of data
is being processed.

And test_and_set_bit() does return a value, namely the value of the
affected bit before the operation.  Therefore, any correct implementation
for a CONFIG_SMP build must include memory barriers before and after.
Extracting the relevant passage from Documentation/atomic_ops.txt
between the pair of dashed lines:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	int test_and_set_bit(unsigned long nr, volatile unsigned long *addr);
	int test_and_clear_bit(unsigned long nr, volatile unsigned long *addr);
	int test_and_change_bit(unsigned long nr, volatile unsigned long *addr);
Like the above, except that these routines return a boolean which
indicates whether the changed bit was set _BEFORE_ the atomic bit
operation.
WARNING! It is incredibly important that the value be a boolean,
ie. "0" or "1".  Do not try to be fancy and save a few instructions by
declaring the above to return "long" and just returning something like
"old_val & mask" because that will not work.
For one thing, this return value gets truncated to int in many code
paths using these interfaces, so on 64-bit if the bit is set in the
upper 32-bits then testers will never see that.
One great example of where this problem crops up are the thread_info
flag operations.  Routines such as test_and_set_ti_thread_flag() chop
the return value into an int.  There are other places where things
like this occur as well.
These routines, like the atomic_t counter operations returning values,
require explicit memory barrier semantics around their execution.  All
memory operations before the atomic bit operation call must be made
visible globally before the atomic bit operation is made visible.
Likewise, the atomic bit operation must be visible globally before any
subsequent memory operation is made visible.  For example:
	obj->dead = 1;
	if (test_and_set_bit(0, &obj->flags))
		/* ... */;
	obj->killed = 1;
The implementation of test_and_set_bit() must guarantee that
"obj->dead = 1;" is visible to cpus before the atomic memory operation
done by test_and_set_bit() becomes visible.  Likewise, the atomic
memory operation done by test_and_set_bit() must become visible before
"obj->killed = 1;" is visible.

But, yes, atomic_inc_return() does indeed force ordering.

Yep.  And CPU 1 will also see any preceding unrelated assignment
prior to the new value of aa as well.  And it is not just preceding
stores.  See the sentence from Documentation/atomic_ops.txt:
	All memory operations before the atomic bit operation call must
	be made visible globally before the atomic bit operation is
	made visible.
Both stores -and- loads.

Yep -- the test_and_set_bit() operation has no clue who else might or
might not be reading t->state.  Besides, tasklets need not be allocated
on a per-CPU basis, and therefore tasklet_schedule() must be prepared
to deal with other CPUs concurrently manipulating t->state, for example,
via the tasklet_disable() interface.
Another thing that might help is to fill in the RCU read-side critical
section that CPU 2 would have to execute (after all the stuff you currently
have it executing), along with the RCU update that would need to precede
CPU 2's call_rcu() call.  I have done this in your example code below.
Note that in order for a failure to occur, CPU 1 must reach /* A */
before CPU 2 reaches /* B */.
One key point is that tasklet_schedule()'s memory ordering affects this
preceding code for CPU 2.  The second key point is that acquiring and
releasing a lock acts as a barrier as well (though a limited one).
The result is that CPU 2 must see CPU 1's update to rcp->cur in the
case that CPU 1 makes it to /* A */ before CPU 2 makes it to /* B */.

The one called by CPU 2 that appears immediately before my response below.
All that aside, unless Manfred, Dipankar, or whomever can point out
some other ordering constraint that I have missed, this one is messy
enough that an additional explicit memory barrier might be in order.
Manfred?  Dipankar?
