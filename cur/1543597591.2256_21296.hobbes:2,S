The issue was in a stack overflow in the test program, as Alexander
pointed out. Is the stack order different on Solaris et.al v. Linux?
Could this be why it worked so well on the other OS's? The correct
version of the program is as follows:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#define TEST_SZ 25000000
#define RD_BUFF_SZ 5000
int main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **env)
{
    FILE* fp;
    if(argc > 1) fp = fopen(argv[1], "r+");
    else fp =tmpfile();
    if(NULL != fp) {
        int j = -1;
	off_t o;
        while(1) {
            if(++j != TEST_SZ) {
	        if (j == (TEST_SZ - RD_BUFF_SZ) ) o = ftello(fp);
                fwrite(&j, sizeof(int), 1, fp);
            } else {
                int i, buffer[RD_BUFF_SZ];
		fflush(fp);
                fseek(fp, o, SEEK_SET);
                fread(buffer, sizeof(int), RD_BUFF_SZ, fp);
                printf("Validating end of file writes (%d %d)\n",
sizeof(int),
		       RD_BUFF_SZ);
                for(i = (RD_BUFF_SZ - 1); i >= 0; i--) {
                    assert(buffer[i] == --j) ;
                }
                rewind(fp);
		j = -1;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs,
  then you clearly don't understand the situation.
