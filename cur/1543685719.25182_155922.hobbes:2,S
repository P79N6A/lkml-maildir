Hello,
I've just see this today on a machine running 2.6.0-test2-bk7:
Aug  9 16:48:03 abydos kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Aug  9 16:48:03 abydos kernel: md1: rw=0, want=4000855256, limit=5863424
Aproximatively 10 times :-/
The result is awful:
s--xrws---  28436 3902563852 2186484323 4286391822 Jan 10  2015 uptime
(yes, uptime is a socket :-/)
Several program seems to be corrupted in /usr/bin (maybe elsewhere also..)
The file system is ext3 and md1 is a raid1 array mounted on /usr.
/dev/md/1             2,8G  2,3G  329M  88% /usr
The IDE controler is an Intel on a P4P800.
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 24db (rev 02)
I have just rebooted on test3, I have the same output at boot time, the
file system seems to be "definitively corrupted".
