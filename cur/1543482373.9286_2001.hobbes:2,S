Perhaps this is driver related, but after a few hours (sometimes a day) of
network activity, all tcpip activity becomes sluggish, stalling on every
connection regardless of where the machine is (even across campus, which
has an FDDI ring).  This occurs regardless of time or network utilization.
Restarting the network stack by stoping and restarting the network system
in (redhat 5.2) /etc/rc.d/init.d/network clears the problem up for an hour
or two (transfers that would take 5-6 hours finish in a few minutes).  
Running Redhat 5.2, Linux kernel 2.2.0-final, though this has been a
problem for every devel kernel I've used.  Ethernet card is an SMC-Ultra
EZ (using the smc-ultra driver).  
Card is ISA.  /proc/interrupts:

I don't always get that error message, but I'd bet its related.
