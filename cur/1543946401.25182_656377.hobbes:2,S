Subject: [PATCH] splice: fix problem with sys_tee and SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/19/388

From: Johann Felix Soden <johfel@users.sourceforge.net>
With SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK sys_tee should return number of duplicated bytes,
not only -EAGAIN on success.
This patch also solves the problem, which is described on
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/642502.
