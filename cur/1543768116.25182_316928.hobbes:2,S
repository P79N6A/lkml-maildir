sorry I wasn't clear in my last email, when I said 'HD44780 compatible display'
I was talking about electrical signals compatibity.
Actually I will use a lcd that supports graphical or text (80x20) mode. 
I assume that a design for this kind of lcd is different from hd44780's one. 
And that's the reason I want to use kernel vc...
