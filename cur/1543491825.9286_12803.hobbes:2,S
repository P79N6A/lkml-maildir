so I´ve searched everywhere and found nothing
how to set up this situation (a sbawe32 and a vibra16c <- this one
works  at my machine in "alone mode" althougt it was told not to do)
I´d like to have it since it worked fine with the 2.0.x kernels
but I can´t give the sb.o module two dma and dma(card 2) and another
for the two 16 bit dma´s
help anyone??
