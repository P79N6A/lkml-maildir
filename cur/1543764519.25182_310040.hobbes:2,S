rw locks only help if readers are 10x more common than writers generally
speaking. They are quite expensive locks, so they really should be used
with the utmost care. 
(if you have really long hold times the dynamics are different, but if
you have really long hold times your latency sucks too and wasn't that
what this thread was trying to fix?)
