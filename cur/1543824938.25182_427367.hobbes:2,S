So...   why not use four u16s?

Sigh.  I guess one gets used to that PAGES_BYTE thing after a while.  If
you're not familiar with it, it obfuscates things.
<hunts around for its definition>
So in fact it's converting a loff_t to a pgoff_t.  Why not call it
convert_loff_t_to_pgoff_t()?  ;)
Something better, anyway.  Something lower-case and an inline-not-a-macro, too.

You've had a bit of a think and you've arrived at a design decision
surrounding the arithmetic in here.  It's very very hard to look at this line
of code and to work out why you decided to implement it in this fashion. 
The only way to make such code comprehensible (and hence maintainable) is
to fully comment such things.
