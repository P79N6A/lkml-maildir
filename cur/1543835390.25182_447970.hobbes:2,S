Thanks for the report.
"hi" is guaranteed to be nonzero and valid at these places. The 
safeguards are the if clauses in lines 1042, 1050, 1074, 1082, 1090. 
Their conditions will evaluate to false if "hi" was NULL. This is 
because of the order of how members of struct scsi_id_instance_data are 
initialized in sbp2_alloc_device() and sbp2_start_device().
What other potential errors did your checker find in 
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c?
