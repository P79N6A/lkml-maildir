2b) don't try that hard, and hopefully speed things up:
<pseudocode>
for (max = 3814; /* max == 999817216 * 8 */; max = max * 8) {
// the above values result from int(1000000000/8^6){,*8^6}
        newpid = random(max)+1;
        if allocate_pid(newpid)
                goto got_the_pid;
        // repeat the above in order to make it less likely
        // to get a high PID? I hope it's not nescensary.
        if (max == 999817216) // otherwise an uint32 will overflow
                break;
}
// possible here to increase the chance for a low pid but also for
// long runs while searching for the first free pid:
// newpid = random(99999)+1;
pid_search_stop = newpid;
while (++newpid != pid_search_stop) {
        if allocate_pid(newpid)
                goto got_the_pid;
}
got_the_pid:
</pseudocode>

Find a cheap random function.
What to do on 4294967295 allocated processes?
Eternal starvation if nearly 4294967295 are present and the right ones
get stopped/started?
