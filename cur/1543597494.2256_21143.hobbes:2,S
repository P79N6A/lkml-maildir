Guys,
This is my first attempt at writing at the kernel
level. I'm working on a device driver, and usually in
userspace, I use Kill() to send a signal to a PID I
know of.
At the kernel level, I don't know of any kill()
equivalents (are there any?), except send_sig_info().
Send_sig_info(int, struct siginfo *, struct
tasktstruct *)
I know the int is the PID from "Understanding the
Linux Kernel -Oreilly". 
The problem I'm experiencing is that I'm not sure how
to find the pointer to taskstruct.  From what I"ve
read, the pointer to taskstruct is a pointer to the
target process.  How do I find the pointer to the
taskstruct of that task I want to send a signal to, if
I only know its PID?
Thanks, any help would be greatly appreciated.
Sam
