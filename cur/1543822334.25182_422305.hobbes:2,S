which is wrong, we don't want to apply the qurik for *ALL* via devices
the comment says we want it only for on-ship devices

as best as i can tell this is a complete list
i tried to get details of people with hardware and was told to check
in a museum :-)
also, what *new* devices? this hardware is pretty ancient what we have
listed now should be close to everything

the quirk gets run for VIA chips on chipsets that don't need it, so
the interrupt line is masked down when it sometimes shouldn't be (does
it mean they will always be IO-APIC-edge / PIC in that case?)

from reading the comment and chedcking over pci_ids.h i think the list
is complete
in fact, i'm not sure that PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C586_0 and
PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C686 are strictly speaking supposed to be in the
list, it's unclear there and seems harmless enough
