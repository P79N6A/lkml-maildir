You're still ignoring the other problem of set_memory_uc() not 
handling fixmap and ioremap correctly. I explained it to you
several times now and you have not replied to it once. If you
think my analysis of this is wrong please describe exactly
where it is wrong.
Sure if you're only fixing half the bugs you get a simpler patch,
but you also still got half the bugs.
