Hi,
I just downloaded the 2.2.3 and I built a bzImage kernel about
800KB.  It built cleanly and I reinstalled LILO.  When I rebooted,
I got an "Out of memory" upon booting the kernel then it halted the
system.  So I changed the DMA option for sound cards (not config'd) and
the parallel port ATAPI devices (modules) and the system boots fine.
