You mean the patch to avoid bounce buffering? Andrea has an uptodate
version here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19pre8aa3/00_block-highmem-all-18b-11.gz
In short, it does its magic by not relying on the virtual mapping of a
given page. If you want more info than that, you'll have to ask more
qualified questions.
