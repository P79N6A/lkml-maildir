I'm no expert on this, but my understanding is that swap needs to have
the entire swap area in contiguous sectors, which can't be guaranteed
for files, but is a given with partitions.
Indeed, as I understand it, on the ext2 file system, ANY file that's
over 16 Megs in size is of necessity split into several separate
fragments...

I don't believe it can, since the specific advantage gained by swap
partitions that I mentioned above is in general irrelevant in all
other contexts...

Unfortunately, swap also has some unique requirements which make the
difference...

Unfortunately wouldn't work - you'd have to creat a whole bunch of
separate files, each just below the fragmentation limit, and each
residing in a separate "block group" (the kernel's name, not mine), as
otherwise, they'd be unusable...
Best wishes from Riley.
