Well, there is the generic (page 34 in the latest draft)
 [EFAULT]
 Bad address. The system detected an invalid address in attempting to use
 an argument of a call. The reliable detection of this error cannot be
 guaranteed, and when not detected may result in the generation of a signal,
 indicating an address violation, which is sent to the process.
valid for all calls. That is: if the kernel notices the bad address
it must return EFAULT. If not, e.g. because the routine is implemented
in libc, then one may get SEGV.
