If you will have time for newbie, to explain in a few words, what is it need
for (whole idea, or key detail), and, maybe, why it is generated so ... interestingly:
            asm-offsets.c -> *.s -> *.h
 (but this looks like interconnecting C and assembler, obviously)
I will glad to help providing solution maybe somewhat earlier (well, i'm
trying to understand whole building process, if that matters).
.... And, of course, if this q isn't dumb.
Thanks.
