That's a 64-bitism.  And 32-bit machines are more space-sensitive.

So this is basically "increase size of comm[] by 4 bytes, happens to be
zero-cost on 64-bit machines".
We do occasionally hit task_struct.comm[] truncation, when people use
"too-long-a-name%d" for their kernel thread names.  But we seem to manage.
