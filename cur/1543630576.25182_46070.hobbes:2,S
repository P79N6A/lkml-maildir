IMHO logically request queue is a separate entity for each disk.
IDE can have 2 devices on one cable (or more: think about
buggy cmd640 like chipset as a weird IDE with four disks
on a channel since we can talk to one disk only at a time).
This fact is a hardware limitation which can be hidden,
IDE code should arbitrare access to IDE channel.
But why mix up queues?

This is naturally happening with one queue per disk.

It is a _spin_ lock.
Does this mean you will spin on it while IDE request for other disk
is processed?
Somebody enlighten me: can IDE mix reqests and completion like this:
host ----read reqest---> master
host ----read reqest---> slave  (is this possible?)
host <---interrupt------ master
host ----okay,send it--> master
host <---data----------- master
host <---data----------- master (do slave has to wait until end here?)
host <---data----------- master
host <---that's all----- master
host <---interrupt------ slave
	(can host issue another read for master here?)
host ----okay,send it--> slave
host <---data----------- slave
Please comment what is allowed and what is not.
I suspect we are in IDE chipset bugs land here.
Does current IDE code (as Martin sees it) utilize this fully but
does not push IDE over limit?
Hm, seems like IDE code needs to remember set of ATA capabilities
(i.e. what should be serialized and what can be safely intermixed
in time) for each controller in order to run full speed on good chips
yet don't croak on buggy ones.
