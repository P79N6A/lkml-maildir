Ah sorry - I missed that.
I still don't quite like the approach.  What about simply putting
the mii using functions into usbnet-mii.c and let makefile doing
all the work?  This would require a second set of ethtool ops,
but I'd actually consider that a cleanup, as it makes clear which
one we're using and allows to kill all the checks for non-mii
hardware in the methods.
