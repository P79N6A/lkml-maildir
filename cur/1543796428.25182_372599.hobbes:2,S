I was seeing exactly the same problem here.  I don't think it's related
to -rt21, I think someome posted a malformed message to LKML or one of
the other lists that we are both on and Evo is choking on it.  It starts
to download the mail then you get "Storing folder" for like 5 minutes
then it crashes.
I finally managed to get into my mail by (carefully) deleting ALL
metadata - all the .index, .index.data, .cmeta, and .ev-summary files
from .evolution.
