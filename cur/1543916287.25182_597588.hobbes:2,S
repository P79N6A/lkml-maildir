I tried to show, that keeping users in compete information vacuum is a
bad thing. Even without sources, _configuration_ makes another area of
mis-working and bugs, usually addressed by reinstalling.
That may be bad example, because here talk is about developers and
testers, who are not just ordinary users. And by applying Torvalds's Law,
all users are such in some degree. That's why {1} in your reply, Rob,
makes perfect sense.
If Mark have a bad experience with lusers only, then i just can say: what
a pity! AFAIK nobody can read somebody's plain-bin OOP output.
Anyway, anything must be opted by config options, even schedulers. But
maintenance and flame wars rule otherwise :).
What i can propose is form of binary-only "printk", where all info:
diagnostic, error, bug, statistics messages (in not debugging
environment, of course), is just fed right to output buffer (see,
pa, no kmallocs). Info itself must have structured content, that makes it
easy to extract and locate human-readable representation of both message
and data.
This doesn't address loglevels, though.
Implementation (seems) as easy as feeding output to `od` to have
unambiguous form of various troublesome bytes, like "0x00" and "0x0A",
Structuring, who is printing, i.e. arch code, fs, driver whatever, must be
agreed:
*  Profiles[0]: originator's ID of a message is a byte (or word, or double word)
   0x01 - arch, 0x02 - fs, 0x03 - net, 0x04 - hw drivers, etc.
*  Data itself can be sent in form of [0]
[0] Banana -- extendable protocol for sending and receiving s-expressions

and having shell script with functions, that have names that correspond
to actual structured content:

From file linux/drivers/usb/serial/ti_usb*c with

lets tacke one particular function (transformed a little bit):

Now switch on imagination and see how printk just puts
'\007\010\params'
and userspace after some banana `od`dity just calls shell functions.
Yet another thing to export to the userspace. But surely only for those
who whats that.
