I don't claim this fixes a bug on Alpha (I'm sorry I was misleading with
"the alpha semantics of rmb"). What I meant alpha defines wmb this way:
	WMB guarantees that writes to memory-like regions that precede the
	WMB are ordered before writes to memory-like regions that follow
	the WMB.
so my own definition of RMB become:
        RMB guarantees that reads to memory-like regions that precede the 
        RMB are ordered before reads to memory-like regions that follow 
        the RMB.
So this code:
	(*ctr)++;
	rmb();
	if (spin_is_locked(lock)) {
is obviously wrong. Doing (*ctr)++ above rmb() means nothing. The CPU will
increse the per-cpu lock but it will flush the write buffer only after
checking spin_is_locked. This will break the ordering and the br lock
will break badly then.
The write lock operation was safe only because the spin_lock always imply
a mb (not rmb) barrier before continuing after the spin_lock.

If the semantics of the sparc64 rmb() aren't defined as I described above
I'd like to know.

Of course, alpha have to fallback to asm mb in the rmb() case. No argument
about that.

Even if that would be true the rmb() was not enforcing that. rmb() will
allow the counter decrement to be flushed to memory past the memory read
in the spinning loop. That's why I said the rmb() there is useless anyway.
I don't see why we need any ordering in the fallback path. The
spin_is_locked is just a slow path loop like in the normal spinlocks.
Nothing needs to be atomic there. We're just waiting the write lock to go
away and we are doing the decrement to make sure it will go away
eventually. The counter decrement will be flushed eventually thus no need
of wmb either. OTOH doing wmb (instead of the current wmb()) would have
the sense to make the change visible to the other CPUs ASAP but I don't
think it worth (the write lock case is not worth optimizing and I prefer
to save icache as said).
