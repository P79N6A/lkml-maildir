	ok, i tried that. i put a file through ftp twice and got
	what 10mb ethernet gives: about 1MB/s
	tried it with 131072 & 65536.
	btw, if it compiles it's ok isn't it? cause i have to write
	a header file for the shapecfg, and compiled just fine.
	thanks for the flash respond, couldn't have it from usock.
