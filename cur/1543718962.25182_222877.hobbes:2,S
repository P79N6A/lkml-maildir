You're reading it wrong.
The "including when the present flag is set to zero" part does not mean 
that the present flag was zero _before_, it means "is being set to zero" 
as in "having been non-zero before that".
Anytime the P flag was clear _before_, we don't need to invalidate, 
because non-present entries are not cached in the TLB.
