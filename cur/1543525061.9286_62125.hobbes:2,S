Well, in NT, IRIX, BeOS, and (I think) Solaris tasks running in kernel
mode can be preempted any time as long as they're not holding a spinlock.
Certainly making a kernel preemptible increases complexity.  I'd be
interested in hearing about the tradeoffs here - hasn't Larry McVoy talked
about this in the past on this list?

Won't this hose RT-Linux?  If random device drivers start using NMI (as
Alan Cox suggested in a different mail) then it would be really nice if
there was a way to disable this behavior at compile time.
