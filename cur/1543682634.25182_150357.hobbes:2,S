In this case, does it happen if you exit X, or only if you are switching
to the console while X are active? If it happens only in second case, then
it is bug (I believe fixed long ago) in XFree mga driver: it was sometime
reprogramming color depth and line length in the accelerator even when
inactive (Gnome1 clock applet running in top right corner was known to
trigger this, depending on clock settings matroxfb would cease to
work in one second or (up to) one minute after VT switch, depending on clock
applet setting... it is possible that it happened only with kernel mga dri
driver active, but I'm not 100% sure).
I know no other workaround than using same color depth and same xres_virtual
(vxres on fbdev & desktop width in X) in X and on the console.
