Perhaps that's because it wasn't until last week that the upstream
maintainers heard of these problems?
So far there isn't much in the way of controlled experiments, but:
  All the reports agree the problem is independent of filesystem.
  One thread suggests only filesystem metadata is corrupted, not file
  data, and wonders if something's going wrong with (unsupported) write 
  barriers.
  Another report said dm-crypt over raid5 failed while raid5 
  over dm-crypt worked.
