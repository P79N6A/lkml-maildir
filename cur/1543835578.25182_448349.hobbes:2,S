Agreed, from what Matthew's said it seems like the daemon is being used to 
hide intellectual property, not something we should really be encouraging.
I think the title "regulatory daemon" has multiple meanings, it REGULATES your 
frequencies to FCC specs, it REGULATES your wireless card's power and 
temperature levels, and it REGULATES your right to use the hardware ;-)
Ultimately the question remains, will we open this can of worms by accepting 
drivers that depend on proprietary software (i.e. they will not function at 
all without it). I'm fairly sure the answer should be "No".
