Hi Greg, hi Takashi,
I would suggest these two patches for inclusion into the stable tree. They 
both fix a keyboard lockup when unplugging USB audio hardware.
With the first one applied I can plug / unplug my webcam without losing my 
keyboard. I couldn't test the second one, but both patches are in ALSA CVS.

Cheers,
Gregor
