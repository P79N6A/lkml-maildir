No, I wasn't meaning any swsusp special casing at all.
I was just using Pavel's swsusp-related mail as the hook to raise
the point that had been haunting me with every earlier mail on
this subject, mails I'd already deleted.
Pavel seemed to imply overriding the requested affinity for tasks
(in preferring #1 migration), I doubted he really wanted that.

I was afraid that "for_each_online_cpu"-type scans would skip over
the unplugged cpus, in such a way that the homeless tasks might be
awkwardly invisible in some contexts.  If no such problem, fine.

I wasn't meaning "kill -9" for the swsusp case, but for the general
unplug cpu case.  We have a number of homeless tasks, which the admin
might want to run again when "the" cpu is plugged back in; or might
want to kill off without having to plug a cpu back in.
