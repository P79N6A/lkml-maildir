Fortunately, they'll unstall with probability of 1... so no, I do not
think this is real problem.
If someone takes semaphore in syscall (we do), same problem may
happen, right...? Without need for 2048 cpus. Maybe semaphores/mutexes
are fair (or mostly fair) these days, but rwlocks may not be or
something.
