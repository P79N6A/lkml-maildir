But that's what a device tree means. Think about a USB disk drive: The drive
shows up as a child of the USB controller, which in turn is a child of
the PCI bridge. Note that I did not suggest having the virtio parent set to
the parent of the PCI device, but to the PCI device itself.
I find it more confusing to have a device just hanging off the root when
it is actually handled by the PCI subsystem.
