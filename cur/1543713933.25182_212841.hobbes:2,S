Hi,
Why we need a routing cache?  A patricia tree or radix tree is not fast
enough with the kind of memory speed we have in PC technologies now???
The main goal to remove the routing cache is to avoid to have 4096 routes
limitation + all problem of the cache is not flush correclty when default
route/next-hop for a particular route are change in the middle of a TCP
connection and are not consider at all.  Also, when the routing cache is
finally flush, all the information about the PMTU of the other entries are
lost and must be rebuild.  So it's a lot of rebuilding of information for
nothing when you have a lot of peer to talk with.
It's may look like overkill for a home user, but for commercial server, 4k
routes can be really fast exhauted.  For us, we talking more about million
of routes in the system.  Also, the patch I provide exploit already the
plug/and/pray of the fib.  But doesn't give at all the flexibility to remove
the _unclean_ hack: the routing cache.
What is dirty form the current implementation, quick example spagetti code
with goto going back at the beginning of the function in route.c in IPV6.
All the mtu/pmtu put in the cache entries instead in the fib himself.  Just
to name few examples.
