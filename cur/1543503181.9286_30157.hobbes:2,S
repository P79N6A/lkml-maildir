I don't know if this is related, but I see problems with networking in
2.2.10 vanilla here.
One of my systems has a PCI-bus NE2k clone card, and that works fine
with 2.2.10 - detected, initialised, you name it, it works.
The other system has an ISA-bus NE2k clone card, and that isn't even
detected with 2.2.10 - it just doesn't want to know.
In both cases, both the ne and ne-pci drivers hard compiled into the
kernel - I use the same kernel on both systems. Also, kernel 2.2.8
(the one everybody says is full of bugs) works fine on both systems,
and both network cards work fine under it, so the problem was
introduced in either 2.2.9 or 2.2.10, whatever it is...
Best wishes from Riley.
