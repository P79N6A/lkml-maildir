Ok well excluding do_munmap and exit_mmap the ones that have shown up 
(some more frequently than others) are: 
6ms at ksoftirqd+0x6b
2ms at sys_ioctl+0x47
2ms at b44_open
6ms at fget+0x28
2ms at write_ordered_buffers+0x37
4ms at blkdev_put+0x48
5ms at add_wait_queue+0x21
4ms at blkdev_put+0x48
and you were right; eventually the reiserfs ones showed up again at 6-8ms
Now which of the above are not false positives and should I try to extract 
the exact locations of them?
