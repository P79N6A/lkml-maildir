what do you think about configuration modules instead of
big-fat configuration interfaces (especially for lowmem-machines).
imagine this: 
parts of the kernel (or modules) export the configurable structures
and there are modules which take the params and configure the stuff.
after doing it, they're killed again.
with this concept drivers could be splitted in two parts: (modules)
a resident and a non-resident one.
the resident part is the real driver code. the non resident one
does the initialization, detection, configuration, etc.
after these things are done, the non-resident part is not needed
anylonger and can be kicked away.
bye,
ew.
