Hi Grant,
I think we are almost in agreement. IMHO, the entire ECN applies the
PC-compatible systems and any examples in the Implementation Note is a
valid implementation. mmconfig can be posted, as long as there is a way
to guarantee that the write has completed, such as flush by reading. We
disagree on this point.
The Intel mmconfig implementation is non-posted which is a valid
implementation. Therefore readl is unnecessary and can be removed.
