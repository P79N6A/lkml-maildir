Your suggestion looks good. I'll code it over the next few days & verify
that it works.
As far as the tlb_migrate patch is concerned, the change to the way machvec
noop functions are implemented is mostly unrelated to the tlb_migrate
patch. We can apply the patches in 2 ways:
	- change machvec noop functions
	- rework the tlb_migrate patch on top of that change
		OR
	- apply the tlb_migrate patch in it's current form
	- change the machvec noop functions including the tlb_migrate noop
Either works. I'm partial to #2 (easier) but will do either....
Note: calling a noop function after an explicit process migration is untidy but 
is not a measurable performance problem. I agree, however, that
the noop function should be improved. At some point in the future, other
noop functions may be added that ARE performance sensitive. It is good to
have the correct infrastructure implemented.
