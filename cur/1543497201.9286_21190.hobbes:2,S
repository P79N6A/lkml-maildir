  Hi, all. Version 106 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.4-pre2. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed silly typo in drivers/scsi/st.c
- Improved debugging in <devfs_register>
				Regards,
					Richard....
