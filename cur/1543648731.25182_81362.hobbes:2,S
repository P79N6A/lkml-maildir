Hi All,
If I try to install an RPM on my machine, it works
fine. It displays  ####.............  100%. I am
sure it is installing perfectly.Once installation is
completed if I query for the RPM, it says the RPM
never installed. what is it behaving that way? Do I
need to do any thing else?
Any inputs will be appreciated.
