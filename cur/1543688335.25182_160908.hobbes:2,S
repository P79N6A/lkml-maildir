I reported a similar issue some weeks ago (Abit K7D-RAID, integrated
HPT372 IDE controller), I played with 2.4.22-pre10 for a while. With the
opensource HPT driver, I reached good speed sometimes (two ATA drives were
connected to the HPT, one drive on each channel), but not reliable - after
a reboot, the md synchronisation between the two drives went down to
1MB/s... The HPT driver uses the drives as SCSI drives, so it's a little
painful to switch between the kernel and the HPT driver (initrd, mdadm,
and so on...). Finally I gave up, and disabled the HPT controller in the
system BIOS. Maybe the problem is a simple IDE autotune problem, I don't
know.
