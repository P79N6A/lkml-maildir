Here's some example code (diff of the assembler codes) which shows what 
I mean:
-       movl    %eax, -8(%ebp)
+       movl    %eax, -4(%ebp)
[..]
-       leal    1(%eax), %ecx
-       movl    -52(%ebp), %edx
+       leal    1(%eax), %edx
         movl    12(%ebp), %eax
-       subl    %edx, %eax
-       movl    %eax, %edx
-       movl    -52(%ebp), %eax
+       movl    %eax, %ecx
+       subl    -80(%ebp), %ecx
+       movl    -80(%ebp), %eax
         sall    $2, %eax
         movl    %eax, %ebx
         addl    8(%ebp), %ebx
