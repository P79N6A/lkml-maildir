In a way, it is. Because after context_switch, the stack
and registers have been replaced by the new task. So if
current was cached somewhere before that task had scheduled
off, then it still would be correct now that it is scheduled
back on.
At points *within* context_switch, current won't be right,
but AFAIKS current is never used in there.
