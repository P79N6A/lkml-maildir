Yeah, I wanted to do that, but git got confused when I did that, and did
what I didn't want. That was, created a new file in the i386 directory,
and diffed the one in this directory.
I'm really want to keep git knowing the history of the file on moving. I
could just simply cat the two files instead. Would that be acceptible?
