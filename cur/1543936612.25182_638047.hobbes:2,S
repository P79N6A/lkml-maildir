The Linux OSI string does more. I just found out that it also drives the
MUTE key behaviour (and you want the behaviour *with* the Linux OSI string
loaded).
Some of the behaviours are actually linux-version agnostic.  E.g. we'll
always prefer that the Mute key send a KEY_MUTE event over the keyboard
controller *without* touching the hardware (which is what it does if the
Linux OSI string is *present*) in ThinkPads where there is no
firmware-specific mixer hardware (i.e. the T61 and probably X61).  For such
uses, the OSI string is fine.
