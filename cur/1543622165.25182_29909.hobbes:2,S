For some adapters, this is possible, for other it is not (at all). You
happen to be a maintainer of one for which it is possible, and thus your
point of view is quite different from mine - mine comes from USB and
other parts of the device world, where no order can even be defined.
And because of that, I do not think that having the host adapters decide
what device gets what number is a good idea. They should provide the
information if they have it, but the final decision should definitely be
done in userspace, by the hotplug agent.
Ie. it should be configurable.
