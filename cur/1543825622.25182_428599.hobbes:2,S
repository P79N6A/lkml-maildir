Hey, i think i found something.
My quota on my huge device is broken.
(inferno   -- 18014398504855404       0       0        18446744073709551519
0     0)
I cant found a way to re-initialize it.
But anyway, at this point i dont need it, trying to disable the quota usage.
We will see....
Thanks a lot!
