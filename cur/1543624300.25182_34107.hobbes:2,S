Hi...
Is there any issue with recent kernels and apic in the 440FX boards ?
I have a dual PPro@200 that locks up solid (no network access) after
some time doing nothing. It lives happy booting with 'noapic'.
I did my homework and the latest references in archives to that
kind of boards is from a year ago or so...
Can this reflect any hardware issue ??
TIA
