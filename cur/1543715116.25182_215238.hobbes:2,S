Well, maybe I should go back and try to get Mesa to work.  I don't need 
a lot of acceleration.  It's just that when I was using the Mesa driver, 
the OpenGL rendering would flash wildly, the colors would be all wrong, 
and the Z buffering was totally messed up, messing up the layering of 
objects, etc.  I didn't have this problem with RH9, but with Gentoo, 
it's completely broken.  Of course, I probably flubbed a step in the 
installation (that seems to be a 'feature' of Gentoo, although I really 
like Gentoo).

Maybe that's what I should use.  The 2.6 radeonfb doesn't seem to 
accelerate scrolling right yet anyhow, so what do I care?  :)
THANKS!
