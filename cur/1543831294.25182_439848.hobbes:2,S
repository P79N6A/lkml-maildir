2.6.9-22.EL(CentOS 4.2) is what I currently use.
2.4.20 was where I first saw, in keyboard.c, the
workaround that throws away a second break code.
I think I like the new design for the user input
system: separate the protocol layer from the raw port.
But, would it be nice for the atkbd driver to still
provide a raw (or passthrough) mode?
Thanks,
Congjun Yang
