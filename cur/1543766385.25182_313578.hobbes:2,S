Yeh that's ok - is there anything that would hotplug a cpu
automatically; say on receiving some MCEs ; and thus not
give the admin a look in.

Agreed; since the kernel will reset it to the default affinity then
this involvement must happen before the hotplug, if the kernel were
to stop scheduling them anywhere then this is something that could
be fixed up externally to the app by a hotplug type of thing after
the hot un-plug happened.
