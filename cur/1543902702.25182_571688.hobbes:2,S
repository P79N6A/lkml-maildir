i've Cc:-ed Auke - maybe he has some ideas? I've also attached all the 
other possibly relevant ethtool dumps of eth0 below, done when the hung 
interface happens. (Auke, see more details about this problem in this 
thread on lkml.)
another thing: how can i make the tx timeout much longer than it is 
right now? Maybe an interrupt is delayed for long and we just dont 
tolerate things long enough - and once the device tx timeout has been 
noticed we kill the interface from subsequent use in essence?
there's one oddity i noticed:
 0x02810: RDH   (Receive desc head)       0x00000000
 0x02818: RDT   (Receive desc tail)       0x000000FE
 0x03810: TDH   (Transmit desc head)      0x00000000
 0x03818: TDT   (Transmit desc tail)      0x00000000
doesnt this suggest that we have a receive packet, just the irq didnt 
come and we didnt process it?
although .. the tx timeout disabled the transmitter and the receiver of 
the device, correct? That in itself could have destroyed any evidence of 
what happened earlier on. But ... i'm really only guessing here.
