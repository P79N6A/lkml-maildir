That is already perfectly well defined in the LFS standard.  If you open
a file with a 32-bit off_t and the file is larger than 2G, you get
EOVERFLOW.  Similarly, extending a fd opened with 32-bit off_t past the
2G boundary returns the same error.

The worst that will happen is that such a utility will fail with a
clean, well-defined error code.

Please read the standard before continuing with this thread, it already
deals with these issues.
