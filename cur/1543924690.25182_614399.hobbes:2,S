Greg:
So what's our status?  Do you think it's worthwhile adding the 
"drop reference to parent kobject at remove time instead of release 
time" patch?
Also, what's the story on the updates to the USB uevent routines?  Do 
you want separate patches from Kay and me or should we combine them 
into a single patch?
