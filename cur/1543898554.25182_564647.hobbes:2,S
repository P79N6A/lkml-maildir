Subject: [PATCH 1/1] docs: static initialization of spinlocks is OK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/3/217

Static initialization of spinlocks is preferable to dynamic
initialization when it is practical.  This patch updates documentation
for consistency with comments in spinlock_types.h.

+Dynamic initialization, when necessary, may be performed as
