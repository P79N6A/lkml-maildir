Subject: [PATCH 3/3] remove verify_area() - remove fs/umsdos/notes as it only contain a verify_area related note
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/29/181

The file `fs/umsdos/notes' contains only a small note about a possible bug
involving verify_area(). Since umsdos is no longer in the kernel and 
verify_area() is also gone, it seems to make sense that this file goes the 
way of the Dodo.
After applying this patch the `fs/umsdos/' directory will be empty and can
be removed entirely.

-	There is a call the verify_area that does not take in account
-	the count parameter. I guess it should read
-
-	error = verify_area(VERIFY_WRITE, dirent, count*sizeof (*dirent));
-
-	instead of
-
-	error = verify_area(VERIFY_WRITE, dirent, sizeof (*dirent));
-
-	Of course, now , count is always 1
