The OpenBSD guys have been working on closing  buffer overflow holes.
Slashdot has this pointer to a msg from Theo de Raadt:

    In the last while, a couple of people in OpenBSD have
    been putting some buffer overflow "solutions" into our 
    source tree; under my continual prodding.  I thought I 
    would summarize some of these and how they fit together, 
    since what I have seen written up so far has been
    wildly inaccurate.  (Bad reporter, no cookie).
    These are, in short form:
       1) PROT_* purity
       2) W^X
       3) .rodata
       4) propolice
    ...
I like the idea of turning off execute permission on the stack pages.
