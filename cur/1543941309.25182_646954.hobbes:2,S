and how does it change behavior, logically-wise?
do we somehow miss a 'wake-up' from kthread_stop() so that its caller
gets blocked until watchdog's msleep_interruptible(10000) timeouts? On
average, it would take +-5 sec. and might explain the first
observation of Ravael -- "...adds a 5 - 10 sec delay..." (although,
lately he reported up to +30 sec. delays).
(/me goint to also try reproducing it later today)
