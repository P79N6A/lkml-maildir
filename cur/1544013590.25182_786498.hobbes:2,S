Thanks for this patch. However, after reading this, I have a stupid 
question: which file system should I use if I had to reinstall my 
computers from scratch now?
Ext3 means either hardware that supports barriers (not sure how to 
check, and anyway I have to use encryption on the work laptop due to the 
corporate policy) or disabling write cache (but, as Alan Cox said, this 
shortens the lifespan of the disk). Does this requirement apply to other 
journaling filesystems? Do I need journaling at all, given that I have 
an UPS on my desktop and a battery in the laptop?
