Umm. Except if you wrote the code nicely and used spinlocks, you wouldn't 
hold the lock over all those unnecessary and complex operations.
IOW, if you do pre-allocation instead of holding a lock over the 
allocation, you win. So yes, spin-mutexes makes it easier to write the 
code, but it also makes it easier to just plain be lazy.
