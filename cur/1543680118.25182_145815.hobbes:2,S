           Summary: R31 loops under suspend mode (hard disk password mode)
    Kernel Version: 2.5.74
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: apmbugs@rothwell.emu.id.au
         Submitter: dave@nullcube.com
Distribution: Debian Woody Unstable
Hardware Environment: IBM Thinkpad R31
Software Environment: Debian Linux
Problem Description: When placing laptop into suspend mode laptop successfully
enters suspend.  However on returning from suspend laptop laptop (as configured
to) requests
hard disk power up password, when password is entered, laptop immediately
resumes the suspend mode.  This happens indefinitely until forced to hard boot
laptop.
Steps to reproduce:
- Set BIOS to request hard disk powerup password
- Compile kernel for APM PowerOff option
- Once booted under new kernel, place laptop into suspend mode either by closing
lid, or using suspend keys
- Laptop will then begin to display behaviour when brought out of suspend mode.
