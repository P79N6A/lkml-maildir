    This is so in all other HPT drivers (and HPT371N datasheet has the same 
figures -- this chip is the only one supporting UDMA6 and having the default 
DPLL clock > 50 MHz).  Note that it means that there's no actual UDMA5 since 
the timing exactly matches that one used for UDMA4.

    And UDMA4 with 50 MHz clock.

    That's the thing that keeps me confused in the other datasheets too -- 
from my interpretation of their timing figures it seemed to control 2x ATA 
clock multipler. HPT370 datasheet just gives different timings and SCR2 values 
for reads/writes in UDMA5 (I've disabled this mode on HPT370 from which the 
read performance only gained -- not sure if it makes sense to restore the old 
clock turnaround hack).

    Not sure. I had no problems with this on the HPT371N/302 and 371N was 
clocked by 66 MHz DPLL from the start (its default clock is 75 MHz however).
    I'm still holding to my hypothesis that HPT374 simply can't tolerate 66 
MHz DPLL clock, and the UDMA5 timing figures that you've cited seem to prove that.
    I'm going to post a patch today -- how about completely prohibiting UDMA6 
on HPT374?
