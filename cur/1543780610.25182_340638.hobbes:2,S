Sounds reasonable to me.  I'll copy Aaron Young, who I think
actually wrote the code to send the SIGPWR, in case he had a Good
Reason for doing it this way.  (Aaron, if I'm remembering wrong
and you're not the guy who wrote this, let me know...)

Sure.  I'll need to get hold of some hardware/firmware that will
reproduce a critical environmental situation...  Might take a
litte while...
Thanks
