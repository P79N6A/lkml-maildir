Subject: [patch 05/36] USB: fix up EHCI startup synchronization

2.6.22-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net>
patch 1cb52658b4f5b10a9e91f8e1c21ca2bcc1b9a3ca in mainline.
A recent patch added software synchronization during EHCI startup,
so ports aren't switched away from the companion controllers after
resets have started.  This patch adds a short delay letting hardware
finish that port switching before any new resets begin ... so both
ends of that hardware race window are closed.
