Hmm, you're correct... But I do remember that particular error before,
about FBIOBLANK returning -EINVAL. I think it may be coming from 
this particular code
Bool
fbdevHWSaveScreen(ScreenPtr pScreen, int mode)
{
	ScrnInfoPtr pScrn = xf86Screens[pScreen->myNum];
	fbdevHWPtr fPtr = FBDEVHWPTR(pScrn);
	unsigned long unblank;
	TRACE_ENTER("HWSaveScreen");
	if (!pScrn->vtSema)
		return TRUE;
	unblank = xf86IsUnblank(mode);
	if (-1 == ioctl(fPtr->fd, FBIOBLANK, (void *)(1-unblank))) {
		xf86DrvMsg(pScrn->scrnIndex, X_ERROR,
			   "FBIOBLANK: %s\n", strerror(errno));
		return FALSE;
	}
	return TRUE;
}
The FBIOBLANK ioctl call passes only 2 possible values, 0 and 1
(1-unblank).
Andrew, 
I think you should drop this patch, Xorg/XFree86's fbdevhw DPMS support
does the correct thing. It's only the above that may be producing the
particular error as reported by David. I'm not sure how to fix that
(kernel or X side).
