No. They both end up doing a lot of much fancier stuff. There are patches 
in there that I may not be comfortable with, because they end up doing 
things like totally re-doing the locking for some subsystem. 
Yes, they end up re-doing _broken_ locking, but the point is that they are 
not obvious. They are just "more careful" versions of the -mm tree.
