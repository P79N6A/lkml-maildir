We had that argument already in 2000/2001 when we had the big XFree 4.1 DRM
update.  There's no reason drm should be different from all other kernel
subsystems.  If you really fear this is a problem add a monotonely increasing
DRM_VERSION define for driver to check against and even better don't make any
not backwards-compatible changes unless you're doing a major version bump.
