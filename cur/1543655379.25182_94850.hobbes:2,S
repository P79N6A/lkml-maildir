You probably mean the zero-copy pipe patches, which I think really
should go in.  The most recent version of the diffs I saw didn't
use the zero copy bits unless the trasnfers were quite large so it
should be ok and not pessimize small transfers.
That patch has been gathering cobwebs for more than a year now when I
first did it, let's push this in already :-)
