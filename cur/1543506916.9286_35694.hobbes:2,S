Hi to you all,
The third version of the serial driver PCI patch is available at my
little site <
http://people.a2000.nl/omoerbe/>.
 The maximum number of PCI
serial ports supported can now be configured at config time. Also, an
error introduced in include/asm-i386/serial.h is fixed. Actually, this
file and include/asm-alpha/serial.h are not patched at all anymore. 
Regards,
Otto
