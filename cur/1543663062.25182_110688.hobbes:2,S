I wrote an optional feature that stores kernel .config info inside
the 'vmlinux' file in an array named 'configs'.  I don't know if
it's included in your kernel or not.
Some patches for this in-kernel-config feature are available at
http://www.osdl.org/archive/rddunlap/patches/ikconfig/
and it's in Alan Cox's 2.4.-recent patches.
