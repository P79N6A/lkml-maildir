Yes.  The kernel interface specifies it as a bytesteam with
0x00 and 0x2f having special meaning.  That is a constraint,
not a policy.  It is user space that determines the policy
of UTF-8.

Fix the broken apps.  Crashing because of "invalid" UTF-8 is
no more excusable than crashing because of a string longer
than expected (buffer overrun).  Filenames as read from the
filesystem should be treated just like any other untrusted
input.

Since the LSB spec describes user space it might be a
suitable place.

If you have a filesystem with filenames that don't conform
to your policy write userspace tools to detect and/or fix
them.  If you have programs creating non-conforming
filenames, fix or rm those programs.

The kernel won't care.  Any user space code that treats the
filenames as something other than bytestreams should be able
to cope with any sequence of bytes.

OK.  The questions have been asked and answered.
Asking again and again and again won't change the answer.
