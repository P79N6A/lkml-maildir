Yes, I noticed that, when I set KBUILD_VERBOSE, I can see that it just
invokes CC and passes -D__ASSEMBLY__.
So what is setting AS in the Makefile good for then?  And how can I
force the build process to use /usr/x86_64/bin/x86_64-linux-as rather
than /usr/bin/as?
Also, isn't it a bug for the Makefile not to pass -m64 if I specify
ARCH=x86_64?  If I don't change the CFLAGS I get:
$ make ARCH=x86_64                              
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CC      arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.s
arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.c:1: error: code model 'kernel' not
supported in the 32 bit mode
make[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 1
make: *** [prepare0] Error 2
