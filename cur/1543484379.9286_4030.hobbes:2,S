	Why not glob(3)?
	I think it is important that modutils not be dependent on glibc2,
because the legal problems with glibc2/libio may force Yggdrasil to
switch back to libc5.
	Anyhow, there are many ways to solve this either in modutils
or in a system's boot scripts, and getting the shell out of modprobe
will make it run faster anyhow.  As long as executing an arbitrary
binary does not always cause the loading of a module, it is not a
C library issue.
