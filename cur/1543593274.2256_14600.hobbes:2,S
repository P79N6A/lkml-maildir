Hi
	Since my first try on 2.4 kernel, I had trouble with DMA when I select
	activate on boot time because it selects udma4, whereas my HD is only able
	to do udma2. I correct that with hdparm, but I was quite happy of the patch
	in ac4 whixh detect ide lost interrupt and retry with a value lower of dma.
	But it seems that this patch does not work anymore in ac7?? I can not see
	in the changelog that you come back or made other change in ide?? Should it
	work in the same way or not?
	My hardware: via 686a of course, with Athlon 500 on a k7m MB
		Thanks
		Mickael
