Hi,
In the following document:
http://www.austintek.com/LVS/LVS-HOWTO/HOWTO/LVS-HOWTO.arp_problem.html
The following is noted:
"The risk is that other hosts can probe for VIP using unicast packets
for which the hidden flag always replies. I'll continue to support the
hidden flag 
for 2.4 and 2.6 to help existing setups but switching to the new device
flags (or other solutions) is recommended".
If there is currently no way to provide this functionality using
arp_ignore/arp_annonce/arp_filter or their friends, why is this still a
patch
And is not integrated into the mainline kernel?
Regards,
Menny
