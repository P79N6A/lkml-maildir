Turns out, I was running 2.4.0-test6-pre9 and it appears that the memory leak
is indeed fixed in the 'final' version of 2.4.0-test6. I've been running fine
for 2 days now and have not seen any problem with the amount of memory free,
even after compiling the kernel & GCC twice with only 32MB of memory.
Sorry for the misinformation.
