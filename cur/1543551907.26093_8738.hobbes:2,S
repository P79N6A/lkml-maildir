You keep on bringing up remap_page_range(), and it does nothing of the
sort.
remap_page_range() does one thing, and one thing only: it populates the
page tables with physical page mappings.
It has nothing to do with pinning.
It so happens that the vmscan stuff won't ever remove a physical page
mapping, but that's simply because such a page CANNOT be swapped out. How
would you swap out the PCI space?
I don't see why you consider that to have anything to do with kiobuf's.
