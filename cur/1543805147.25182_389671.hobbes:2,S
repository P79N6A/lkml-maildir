Subject: [PATCH] Export symbols so CONFIG_INPUT works as a module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, modular input support fails to load with the following error:
qube:# modprobe input
input: Unknown symbol kobject_get_path
input: Unknown symbol add_input_randomness
In the short run, this can be solved by exporting these two symbols.
There have been discussions about fixing this in a different manner,
see 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0505.2/1068.html
Since this was in the days of 2.6.12-rc4 and modular input support is
still broken, I suggest these symbols to be exported for now.
