freeze_processes() first freezes user-space tasks only, then kernel threads.
Without task_lock() we can miss PF_BORROWED_MM and count the kernel thread
(which is doing use_mm()) as a user space process. This means it will be
frozen prematurely.
true->false means daemonize() or do_exit(), seems harmless.
false->true means exec from kernel space. That is why FREEZER_KERNEL_THREADS
in fact means all tasks, not only kernel threads.
