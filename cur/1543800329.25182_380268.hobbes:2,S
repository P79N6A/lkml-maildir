Hi,
   I've noted for awhile that on my AMD64 machine that has xrun issues
that at least annecdotally it has always seemed that the network
interface was somehow involved. I wonder if this may turn out to be
true?
Q: Did the latency trace stuff ever get fixed for AMD64? I'm running
2.6.15-rc7-rt1 as of today. I've had xruns all afternoon while working
inside of MythTV. (Start, stop, rewind, pause all over the place...)
