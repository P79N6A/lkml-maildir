Subject: 2.6.3 userspace freeze
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
Last night I upgraded two of our webservers from Linux 2.4 to 2.6.3.
During the night both of them rebooted spontanously (i.e. no indication
of why in the log files) several times, so this morning I attached a
serial console to capture the kernel messages, when they rebooted.
What I found was that all of a sudden my SSH connections to the server
and the local vtys would freeze, and it would stop responding to TCP
connections, while still responding to ICMP echo requests. Apparently
all userspace processes just froze. After approximately 60 seconds, it
logged "SOFTDOG: Initiating system reboot.", and rebooted. This was the
only kernel message, except for the boot messages. This happened
repeatedly on both servers.
Both servers run (mainly) Apache 1.3 and Sun Chili ASP (several hundred
processes each), and the freezes seemed to happen during high load
peaks.
I have attached the kernel .config (same on both servers) and the kernel
boot messages including the software watchdog reboot message. Both
servers are identical IBM xSeries 345 servers. I have other similar
servers running 2.6.3 for other purposes without any problems (so far).
Any ideas on what's wrong, or how to find out, would be much
appreciated.
