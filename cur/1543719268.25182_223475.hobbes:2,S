Subject: No timer interrupts shown on PPC32?

I was watching vmstat output on my PPC (Motorola Powerstack II Pro4000,
PReP, OF, no residual data) and noticed that vmstat show almost no
interrupts. This is because there is no timer interrupt registered in
/proc/interrupts. Is this a known "feature" or just a forgotten thing?
I'm running 2.4.27-pre2.
