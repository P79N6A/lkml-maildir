Ugh. It doesn't look good for me. s/MAX_INT/MAX_INT>>1/ or we will
get into trouble on anything that goes into spin_and_lose. Window is
pretty narrow (notice that lost_it is OK - we only need to worry
about somebody coming in after winner drives Lock from 1 to 0
and before it gets it from 0 to MAX_INT), but we can get into serious
trouble if schedule() will hit that window.
MAX_INT/2 should be enough to deal with that, AFAICS.
However, I would _really_ like to get that code reviewed from the memory
access ordering POV. Warning: right now I'm half-asleep, so the thing can
very well be completely bogus in that area. Extra eyes would be certainly
welcome.

PS: ->Lock should be set to 1 when we initialize semaphore. Destroying
semaphore should do
	if (sem->Lock > 1) {
		close(sem->writer);
		close(sem->reader);
	}
