That sounds like what we did for s390 devices as well. I'm not sure
how similar your virtual devices are to each other, but for the 'ccw'
bus it turned out that all drivers had some version of a large
probing loop that goes through all device numbers.
Consolidating that code made it much cleaner while also allowing us
do the basic probing in parallel.
