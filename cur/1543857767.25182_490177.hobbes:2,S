Hi,
this nash thing is exactly the command which triggers a bit different oops 
in my case. On my side, the oops is fully reproducible. If you manage to 
make your case also reproducible, could you please try to revert 
md-change-lifetime-rules-for-md-devices.patch? This made the oops vanish 
in my case. I think Neil is working on it.
