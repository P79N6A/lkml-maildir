Hi.  I have a patch to kernel 2.2.10 called Uniform Ide Driver
revision 6.19, but the maintainer listed in the patch seems to be on
longer available (I get invalid userid when I try to mail to him).  Is
anyone maintaining this or is it incorporated into the later kernels?
Thanks much -- this seems to be a good driver and I'd hate to lose
such a thing.
