Well, I really don't know about you, but I for one reboot my desktop every
morning. Maybe this is a German attitude, but I generally consider it a
waste
of resources to have my workstation run during the night. For downloads and
the like, I got a headless server which does good power management in the
closet room. Besides, again: everyone [who is not a hacker] likes eyecandy.
I wouldn't normally say that if it wasn't about this discussion.

Absolutely!

Yes! This is exactly what I want!
