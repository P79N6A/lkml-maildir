I have never seen this myself so a bit puzzled???
Is it only kernel/resource.c that generates the .1 file - or is it
somethign that is general?
Can you also try to make sure that this file is generated as part of the
build process. git status before and after should do it.
If you can relaiably provoke it output of make V=1 would be usefull.
