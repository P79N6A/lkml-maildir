Subject: Regression since 2.6.15 - Cardbus system interrupt failure

I recently switched to v2.6.17-rc1 on my HP ze1115 notebook with a mobile AMD Duron stepping 01
processor. I found that none of my cardbus peripherals would work. The relevant lines from a dmesg 
output were:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:0a.0[A] -> Link [LNKA] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:0a.0 disabled
yenta_cardbus: probe of 0000:00:0a.0 failed with error -12
I used 'git bisect' to localize the problem, which turned out to be the changes in commit 
b408cbc704352eccee301e1103b23203ba1c3a0e, which was made on March 23. When I revert this patch, my 
cardbus system behaves normally and the cardbus controller initialization is
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:0a.0[A] -> Link [LNKA] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
Yenta: CardBus bridge found at 0000:00:0a.0 [103c:0022]
Yenta O2: res at 0x94/0xD4: 00/ea
Yenta O2: enabling read prefetch/write burst
Yenta: ISA IRQ mask 0x0038, PCI irq 11
Socket status: 30000821
