I'm on holiday in New York right now so I don't have time to give you a
complete breakdown. But I can give you a couple of comments on Medley RAID
and get back to you when I return next week.
First: It should not be called "SIL", "SII", or "Silicon Image" RAID in
the parts of the code exposed to the user. This is because other vendors
than Silicon Image use the Medley RAID specification (such as the CMD680R
SATA controller and others). When refering specifically to Silicon Image,
SII is the correct abbreviation, not "SIL".
You are asking for more magic to detect Medley RAID. The probe function
for Medley in my patch (medley_probe_drive()) first calls
medley_get_metadata() which uses the checksum to determine if it is a
Medley superblock. In my version, it also checks the PCI vendor ID/product
ID against that stored in the Medley superblock. This is consistent with
how the Medley BIOS verifies a valid Medley superblock and you should rely
on this for automatic detection. But since users might want to move the
RAID set to a different controller, e.g. if their on-board controller
breaks down, there should be an option to force detection to bypass the
PCI ID verification.
After you have a correct checksum there are several other things you can
check for, which I do in my medley_probe_drive() after obtaining the
superblock:
- Check raid_type, it should be 0 for striped sets (RAID0) - I will get
you the values for RAID1 and RAID1+0 when I return from NY.
- Check major_ver, it should be 1 or 2 (other major versions may have a
different superblock and can not be supported).
- Check that the chunk_size looks reasonable, that there is more than 1
drive in the set (drives_per_striped_set), and that the drive_number is
within the range 0-(drives_per_striped_set-1).
If you do all these checks and still come out with a valid candidate, it's
probably safe to assume that the drive belongs to a set if all the disks
are present.
I'll have a closer look when I return home.
