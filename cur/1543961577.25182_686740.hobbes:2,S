Subject: [RFC][PATCH 4/5] must hold lock_super() to set initial mount writer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We need lock_mnt_writers() during a remount in order
to keep mnt->__mnt_writers from changing so that we
get a consistent look at if a sb currently has anyone
writing to it.
But, we need to lock writers out for an extended
period, even during the ->remount_fs() operation.
That's because we do conclusively make the fs
r/o until *after* the ->remount_fs().
lock_mnt_writers() is an awfully blunt instrument
for this since it will lock out *ALL* new writers
on the entire system.  That's bad because that
remount might take a bit.
So, we introduce a new semantic.  Before a new
cpu_writer is established to a mount, it must
lock_super().  This is already a slow path because
the old cpu_writer->count must be coalesced into
mnt->__mnt_writers.  The fast path where (mnt ==
cpu_writer->mnt) is unaffected.
