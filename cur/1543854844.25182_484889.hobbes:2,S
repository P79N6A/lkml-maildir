Ingo,
   I started building the new kernels a few days ago with your
2.6.19-rc6-rt0 announcement. The kernels have built fine but so far I
am unable to build the realtime-lsm package against them so no reason
to reboot.
   I know there were some comments awhile back about being required to
switch to PAM. Has that occurred?
   If not then there is a regression issue for realtime-lsm.
Thanks,
Mark
