This might be a good example of targeting a specific kernel version
rather than a date, since anyone who can't fix this immediately with a
simple search'n'replace is probably trying to support multiple kernels,
and knowing that "2.6.24" (or whatever) is the cut-off version is more
useful than "whatever kernel is current in Sept 2007".
