Yes. Thanks. This option was masked by it's strange dependency
(...) && (X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO!=y || ACPI_PROCESSOR!=m)
Unfortunately I had exactly this configuration. Now with
ACPI_PROCESSOR=y the speedstep-centrino driver works for me *much* better
than acpi-cpufreq! So no need for acpi-cpufreq driver here any more.
Besides it's better frequency scaling the main advantage for *me* over
acpi-cpufreq is that it works without any problem as statically compiled
driver. Now the sole obstacle on my way to a monolithic/static kernel
remains CONFIG_IPW2200=m.
Many thanks for your help
