The situation is there _are_ two threads, both trying to upgrade:
thread 1 blocks waiting for thread 2 to release its lock, and thread
2 blocks waiting for thread 1 to release its lock. Neither will, so
*boom* two cpus taken out.

The fact that the thread releases its read lock before trying to get a
write lock is what prevents deadlocks.

It gets us a little more concurreny: one thread can hold an X lock instead
of a W, so it allows threads which are sure they only want to read to run
simultaneously. A W would prevent that. Since two threads can't have an X
together, we have no deadlocks.
