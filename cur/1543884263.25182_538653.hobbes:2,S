Hi, Alan,
Thanks for bringing this up. There are a couple of patches posted to
lkml for RSS control (unmapped page cache controller under development).
http://lwn.net/Articles/223829/
and the new enhanced verison by Pavel at
http://www.opensubscriber.com/message/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/6456480.html
We would appreciate any feedback to help us move the work forward and
make the code ready for acceptance
