Originally this wasn't a user-selectable config value, it was
auto-selected by any subsystem that needed it. I think that was nicer
from the user-experience, and it would eliminate the need for this
documentation but there were concerns that this triggered unspecified
brokenness in the Kbuild system.

Resource counters aren't a resource controller, they're a helper
library. The others are good examples, as is the memory controller
that's just been added to 2.6.25.
