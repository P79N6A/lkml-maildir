Subject: [RFC patch] MAINTAINERS:  encourage testers to volunteer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Add a new entry-type into MAINTAINERS whereby folks with hardware can 
volunteer to
test patches to the driver.  It should encourage folks to put themselves 
"on the hook"
in trade for a little bit of notoriety.
Hopefully this will help improve:
- support for rare hardware
- QA on that hardware
- connections between hackers & testers
- would-be hackers can find new things to do, esp in less visited parts 
of the dist.
Additions should be approved by maintainers etc, but thats no different 
than is currently done.
