Hi,
Are the files created by the split-includes script actually used yet?
From what I understand, the idea is to reduce the dependencies on
include/linux/config.h, but it would seem that most files still
include this instead of files from include/config/...
Is there a reason for this? 
If it's just that no-one has time to do it, I'll have a go myself..
