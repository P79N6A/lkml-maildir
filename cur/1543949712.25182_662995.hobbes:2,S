No, I'm not. I've been working on the IOMMUs to remove such
workarounds in LLDs.
What drivers need to do on this is just adding a padding length, that
is, drivers don't need to change the structure of the sg list (like
splitting a sg entry), right? And it doesn't break the SAS drivers
that support SATAPI, does it?
But I agree that drivers want to get a complete sglist so I'm fine
with adjusting sglist entries in the block layer with your secode
patch (separate out padding from alignment). As we discussed, I'm fine
with breaking sum(sg) == rq->data_len as long as rq->data_len means
the true data length.

The block layer extends the sg entry? The drivers just adjust
sg->length?
