Welcome to the debate David.  I agree that you only need to sign the
things that the kernel looks at, unfortunately, there's not a nice clear
line: for example the headers change when you strip the module, and they
need to be signed.
Trying to work around it just gets you into more and more complexity:
you can't trust the module until you've checked the signature, and when
you don't trust the module you have to write paranoid code, which is
very ugly and causes bloat.  David Howells just sidestepped this and
trusted the module headers, and so I refused his patch.

Nor do I have to re-iterate the points from the discussion for someone
who hasn't bothered reading it.  But I did.
