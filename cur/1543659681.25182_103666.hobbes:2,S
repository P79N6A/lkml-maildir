    Mmm, interesting idea. A simpler solution is just copy the needed
argv0. In your example, about 500 bytes are wasted ;))) By using the
needed size at argv0, we have the space needed.
    If execv doesn't do any magic with the supplied argv array, then
this should work.

    No, because the len of argv[0] being 'my proggy' is 9, that is not
511 ;)) We cannot tell the allocated space, I'm afraid O:)

    I should smoke crack, definitely. That way I would not mess with
that argv thing XDDDD
    Thanks :)
