I actually like the extra range, it allows for a much softer punch of
background tasks even on somewhat slower boxen.
I've been testing CFS on my 1200 MHz lappy for some time and a strongly
niced kbuild leaves a very usable system. 
The old scheduler would leave the thing rather jumpy. And while CFS
fully fixes the jumpyness, I just did a nice +13 (which should be
equivalent to the old schedulers nice +19 for my HZ) and did a nice +19
kbuild and I can definitely feel the difference between them.
Early CFS versions had an pretty aggressive nice range (0.1% for +19),
and that has been toned down based on feedback. The current levels seem
to work well, at least on my boxen.
