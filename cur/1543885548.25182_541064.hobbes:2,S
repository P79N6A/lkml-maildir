Well, every time this code is instantiated, it gets its own malloc/free
definitions, so they can decide how to handle the dynamic allocations. 
Seems better than assuming that every caller will have enough stack
space.  If you want to approximate that, it would be easy enough to have
a stack-like malloc/free, in which freeing the last allocation will
always release space.
