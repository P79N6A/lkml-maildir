No, I'm being thick.  Please ignore.

Yes, that's probably the low-hanging-fruit wrt CPU consumption in there.

Yes, a descending-order gang lookup would be needed.
It'd be tricky to implement.  Probably you could get just as much benefit
by simply waiting on the highest-index page prior to doing the full-range
walk.  Certainly that'd be interesting as a first step: run some tests, see
what impact it has on context switch totals.
Bear in mind that while waiting on the pages in ascending-offset-order
does incur extra context switches, it also yields lowest latency.  Because it
pipelines the inspection of each page with the ongoing I/O.
