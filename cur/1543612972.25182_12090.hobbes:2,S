That sets the queue sizes bigger, but suppose this:
I have 4M queue size.  I have 4M-2k bytes already in the
queue (2k free).  I have a 4k UDP buffer to write.  I call
select and it says the socket is writable.  However, in this
case I cannot actually write to the socket because I have only
2 of the 4k that I need...  Now, I can detect the failure to send
and re-transmit, but that basically gets me into a tight loop because
select keeps saying I can write, and I keep trying.  The tight loop
is doubly bad because the machine is already highly stressed or it's
buffers would never be so full....
I want select to only say I can write when I'm at XX (say, 64k) bytes of
free buffer-queue space...
