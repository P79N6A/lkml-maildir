 Hmm, how does this relate to my suggestion?  Apart from me having to note
that I have a MIPS-based system with an UHCI -- so these HCs are not
completely limited to Intel-based systems.  Though, unsurprisingly, it
doesn't use any of the legacy crap.  SMI from the south bridge is routed
to somewhere IIRC; probably an ordinary interrupt (and happily ignored).
