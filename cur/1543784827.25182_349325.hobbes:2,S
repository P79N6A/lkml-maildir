The arch specifics don't take up /that/ much space :

So we are talking about less than 100MB, and it's even fairly simple
for you to clean it out by hand if you want. I must admit I don't see
the point of having to maintain such a makefile target.  If you want
to delete the archs that don't matter to you, fine, just do that by
hand then or write a small script for it.

Submit a patch to implement it then.
Personally I don't think this matters or is a good idea.
It doesn't save that much space (<100MB doesn't matter much with the
several hundred gigabyte HD's of today), and it's easy for someone to
delete locally, by hand, if they want to.
As for the "it speeds up grep" argument, that doesn't hold water, you
can just use the --include and --exclude arguments for grep to only
search relevant dirs.
Including a makefile target that does this would also add one more
thing to maintain and keep working for little gain.
There's also the issue of patching the kernel post-pruning. When you
want to upgrade the source of a pruned kernel, lots of the patch for
the next kernel version won't apply any longer.
No, let's not do this, is my oppinion..
