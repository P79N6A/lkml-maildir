hello, 
i m trying to use kernel profiling to optimize nfs
cache performance in 2.4.18. But unfortunately i m
unable to access sgi's ftp site hosting kernprof.
But more unfortunately :
i turned on profiling on the kernel command line with
profile=2
but whenever i give a readprofile command, all i get
is a single line that goes like:
     0 total                 0.0000
1. please suggest a way to make readprofile work.
2. please suggest someother profiling mechanism that
could be of more help
thanks a lot
abhishek
