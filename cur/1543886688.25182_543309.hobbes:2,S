The source tree on the users box has the same problem. The author also
can't update the kernel rpm packages provided by the distibutor where
99.99% of the users get their data.

I have no problem with people using name only, or name and email. Its
not my problem what they use.

You can update the current tree in both cases. You can update neither
source nor binary of an existing release. Your argument is bogus.

You can also solve the problem of bugs in drivers by deleting the driver.
Both are equivalent neither are very smart.
If you find a bogus maintainer entry email then update/remove it. That
way the housekeeping gets done.

Adding new drivers causes future problems, lets stop that too ?
Email addresses in modules are often useful as well - they have utility
just like a new driver does. You don't get one without the other.
