Victor is saying that Andrew contends the hard parts of his low-latency
patch are just as hard to maintain with a preemptive kernel.  This is
true, for the places where spinlocks are held anyway, but it assumes we
continue to treat lock breaking and explicit scheduling as our only
solution.  It isn't under a preemptible kernel.
