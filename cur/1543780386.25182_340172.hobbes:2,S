Hi, Dave, all --
Does anyone remember if they saw any system instability at the time of 
these messages ?
I'm running 2.6.11 on an SMP Opteron box, which is exhibiting these 
notices.  The box occasionally then behaves like it would during a 
serious memory leak - the load average shoots up, the box becomes 
unresponsive, stops accepting network connections, (but memory resources 
are not entirely starved, and nor does the kernel kill any processes off.)
Then - a few minutes later, the computer returns to normal.  This seems 
to happen maybe twice a week.  Thankfully, it's not ruined my weekend 
with a phone call from support yet, but it might. ;-)
If you do remember instability at this time, which was cured with an 
upgrade, then I will schedule some down time to try this out.
