Yeah, this makes sense. We may want to add some other criteria on the
removal of a domain as well (because some of the domain flags do things
that don't use groups).
I don't like so much that we'd rely on it to fix the above problem.
There are a general class of problems with the fork/exec balancing in
that it only works on the top most domain, so it may not spread load over
lower domains very well.
I was thinking we could fix that by running balance on fork/exec multiple
times from top to bottom level domains. I'll have to measure the cost of
doing that, because it may be worthwhile.
Thanks
