If you have a bind policy in the memory grabbing program then the standard try_to_free_pages
should DTRT. That is because we generated a custom zone list only containing nodes
in that zone and the zone reclaim only looks into those.
With prefered or other policies it's different though, in that cases t_t_f_p
will also look into other nodes because the policy is not binding.
That said it might be probably possible to even make non bind policies more
aggressive at freeing in the current node before looking into other nodes. 
I think the zone balancing has been mostly tuned on non NUMA systems, so
some improvements might be possible here.
Most people don't use BIND and changing the default policies like this 
might give NUMA systems a better "out of the box" experience.  However this 
memory balance is very subtle code and easy to break, so this would need some
care.
I don't think sysctls or new syscalls are the way to go here though.
