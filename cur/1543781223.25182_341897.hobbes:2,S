That is disappointing. I was seriously considering a motherboard with your
chipset because of its impressive specifications, but now I have to
reconsider (I'm one of those folks that never bought an nVidia graphics
board due to the lack of open full-function driver). I _hate_ not being
able to use all features.
Any chance your company will reconsider? Are you in a position to make
that decision? Is there a VP I can write to (politely) to support the case?
I don't understand your reluctance in this case (I do for your graphics
processors) - it's not as if adding this function to sata_nv would
expose your crown jewels - you write yourself that next time you'd use a
different (better) interface...
