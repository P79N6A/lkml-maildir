Hi
I made this Framework to generate a .config based on a
Target-System. Right-now it works on my Laptop Acer
TM290. It has to be upgradet to other system as well.
But it's realy easy just read the readme. I would be
realy happy if some of you guys give me some comments
and suggestion about it.
readme:

A patch for the Kernel:
