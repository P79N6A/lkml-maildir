Thanks.
We'll need to be concentrating on the shared pagetable code for
a while, and your patch overlaps with that.  So I've swapped the
applying order (you come second) and I'll probably break your
stuff out separately for a while so Dave can generate clean patches.
When mm3 emerges could you please check mm/mmap.c around here:
        vma = NULL; /* needed for out-label */
I may have misplaced that one...
