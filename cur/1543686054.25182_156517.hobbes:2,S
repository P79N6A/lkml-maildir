After some tinking...
Neither SCHED_FIFO nor SCHED_RR should automatically be promoted to 
SCHED_SOFTRR in the kernel.
* If a process knows about SCHED_SOFTRR it should use that.
  (example: arts should use SCHED_SOFTRR not SCHED_FIFO)
  Problem: what to do when compiling for UN*Xes that does not have SOFTRR.
  [Is there any other UN*X that have something resembling of this? What do
   they call it?]
* Cases where the code has not been modified should be handled by a wrapper
  (library). setscheduler is a weak symbol isn't it?
