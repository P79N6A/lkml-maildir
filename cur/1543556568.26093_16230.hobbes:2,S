I have a vested interest in how this all turns out.  I own a Packet Over SONET
device driver for our OC-12 and OC-48 NICs that I currently pass all parameters
to the driver via arguments on the insmod.  To avoid lengthy commands, we
provide the common defaults.  We accept some basic ifconfig input, but with
SONET/SDH and chip specific items that needed to be controlled, ifconfig did not
seem the way to go.
Thanks!
