It's hard to tell.  I'd assume that the 1000Hz number are
more accurate due to the improved sampling frequency.
If you want a really accurate estimate of CPU usage you could use
`cyclesoak' from 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/#zc.
  It works by
running a low-priority busy-wait loop and then seeing how much CPU is left
over for it by the real workload.  It's not 100% accurate unless you run
your test load with SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_OTHER policy, but it's close.
Making the in-kernel instrumentation more accurate would be possible, but
would incur additional overhead in the CPU scheduler and interrupt handlers
- we don't see a lot of call for it.
But yes, one needs to be cautious when comparing 2.4 CPU load measurements
against 2.6 kernels.

Nope, we use 1000Hz on most architectures.
