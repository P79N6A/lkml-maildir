Nope.
If the lock entity is in a exclusive cache-line, a spinlock does not show 
up on the bus at _all_. It's all purely in the core. In fact, I think AMD 
does a spinlock in ~15 CPU cycles (that's the serialization overhead in 
the core). I think a P-M core is ~25, while the NetBurst (P4) core is much 
more because they have horrible serialization issues (I think it's on the 
order of 100 cycles there).
Anyway, try doing a spinlock in 15 CPU cycles and going out on the bus for 
it..
(Couple that with spin_unlock basically being free).
Now, if the spinlocks end up _bouncing_ between CPU's, they'll obviously 
be a lot more expensive.
