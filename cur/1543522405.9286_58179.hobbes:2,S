This already happened as part of the 32-bit UID merge in Linux 2.3.39.
Check include/asm-{arch}/{ipcbuf,msgbuf,sembuf,shmbuf}.h for the new IPC
interface.
We now have:	32 bits for uid,gid
		64 bits for time_t
		machine word size (32 or 64) for sizes
		32 bits for pid
in all the IPC structures passed to/from user programs.
Thanks,
