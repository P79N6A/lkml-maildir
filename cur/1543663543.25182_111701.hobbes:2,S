In your humble opinion.
Unfortunately, as I've pointed out to you before, this doesn't work in
practice. Workloads may not be easily divisible amongst machines, and
you're just pushing all the complex problems out for every userspace
app to solve itself, instead of fixing it once in the kernel.
The fact that you were never able to do this before doesn't mean it's
impossible, it just means that you failed.

And the profit margin on the big machines will outpace the smaller 
machines by a similar ratio, inverted. The high-end space is where most 
of the money is made by the Linux distros, by selling products like SLES
or Advanced Server to people who can afford to pay for it.
