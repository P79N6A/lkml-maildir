I run two boxes in the UK with RHEL 3 for DNS/DHCP running Lucent's QIP/QMS 
services (Montreal admins run that).  All I am is local SysAdmin on all the 
other stuff.
When I up2dated GLIBC the only thing that went wonky at first was 
smartmontools (built from src), everything else appeared OK.  About 4 days 
later, I was asked to check why one of the QIP monitoring tools wasn't 
running (it's a JVM thing, precompiled binaries).  I then called the Montreal 
Linux guy, and he sussed it and told me it was the assume_kernel problem.
As it is their area, I never asked what he done exactly to fix it, but he did 
say that although the GLIBC upgrade broke the tool, once he fixed the 
problem, it was now working correctly using pthreads (or something) that it 
wouldn't use before the upgrade.  I will ask for more info Monday when back 
at work.
I think Barry K. Nathan reason/problem/solution looks more likely though, re 
futex in this thread.
