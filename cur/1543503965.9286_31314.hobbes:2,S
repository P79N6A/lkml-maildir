According to my current source (or, at least, the source I have
here) the fudging for MAP_FIXED only happens for PER_SVR4. I almost
certainly added it because INTERACTIVE SVR4 required it, that being
the only SVR4 I had. It seems you need to add PER_SOLARIS (are the
syscall and errno tables the same as SVR4 anyway?). There are
three options that I can think of off hand:
1. Change the Linux binfmt_elf.c to spot a Solaris binary (somehow)
   and set the personality to PER_SOLARIS rather than PER_SVR4.
2. See if there is some syscall coming from the crt*.o that can
   be used to trigger a change to PER_SOLARIS (we do that for
   SCO OS5 which has a funky sysi86() in the start up)
3. Have the default lcall27 handler attempt to switch personality
   to PER_SOLARIS and then pass on the call. The current no_lcall7
   already does this to try PER_SVR4 if something not recognised
   as other than Linux does an lcall7(27?) since it's needed to
   get static ELF binaries working.
