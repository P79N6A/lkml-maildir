I don't think that it has anything to do with APM specifically.  On the
kernel which it doesn't work on I can use nothing, ACPI, or APM (with
smp power-off set to on).  On the kernel revisions for which it works I
normally just use ACPI.  I don't like to use APM since it isn't smp
clean completely and I only use ACPI for power-off and reboot options so
I normally just stick with that.  I guess it could be APM which is
broken but then why would ACPI not work for simple rebooting and
shutting down all the time?
