Now we have a 2.3.0 I intend to take the larger patches from that and feed
them into 2.3, removing them from -ac. Notably stuff like hpfs writable etc.
The driver fixes/bug fixes and the big file handles I'll try and feed to
Linus for 2.2.9. At that point hopefully 2.3.x will make 2.2.*ac a null
patch.
