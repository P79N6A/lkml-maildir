Please notice official linus 2.6.15 tree doesn't have this fix... I've
just installed a virtual machine (qemu-system-i386 with linus 2.6.15 +
plain debian 3r0, console output to xterm via emulated serial console)
and trying to use any curses program (top for example) produces
exactly this type of error.
QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=none \
  nice /home/qemu/bin/qemu \
    -nographic \
    -hda debian-30r0-i386-rootfs.ext2 \
    -kernel bzImage-2.6.15 \
    -append "console=ttyS0,9600n8 lpj=10000 noapic root=/dev/hda"
I'm now recompiling with this lower limit to test...
