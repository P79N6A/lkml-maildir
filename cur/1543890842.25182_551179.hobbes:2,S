Can we please have a better name?  "cnt" is usually a (poorly-chosen) name
for an integer counter.  Perhaps "container", or even "rss_container".

We don't we shrink slab if called to shrink a container.
This is a fundamental design decision, and a design shortcoming.  A full
discussion of this is absolutely appropriate to the patch changelog. 
Please don't just hide stuff like this in the patch and leave people
wondering, or ignorant.
