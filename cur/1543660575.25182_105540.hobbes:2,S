do a ps -aux and see if there are any process migration threads, if you do 
then its running the O(1) scheduler.

You really should try the O(1) scheduler.  600 process is a lot, we had ~100 
for our benchmarks so it wasn't as big of a overhead for the old scheduler.  
(Running Itanium 2's didn't hurt either ;) 
Your running Xeon's with more processes, you are more likely to see a benefit 
from the O(1) scheduler.
