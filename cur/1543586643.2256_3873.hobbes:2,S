No, direct overwrite disks are expensive, but they are still available. I do 
not know of any, and have not heard of any problems related to direct 
overwrite technology. For some reason M/O never really caught on in the US, 
and the high price of direct overwrite disks is what seems to be killing 
them off. I have a bunch I use for backup and have never had any problems.
Slow is a relative term. Compared to a Seagate X15? Yes, a M/O drive is 
probably slower. Compared to an 8X CD burner? No, my 640MB and 1.3GB M/O 
drives are quite a bit faster, particularly for random writes. For most 
applications, M/O is designed to compete with the latter, rather than the 
former.
People need to remember that M/O drives are meant to compete with CD-R or 
CD-RW as a moderate capacity, highly robust storage medium for archiving and 
backup. But it is somewhat annoying that 2.4.x doesn't (yet) support their 
2K sector sizes correctly.
