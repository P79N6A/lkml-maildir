I believe that the reason that unloading the module does not help is
because the module_exit is calling pci_disable in the tpm_remove
function.  I'll generate a patch to remove this.
Additionally this version of the driver  was doing a bunch of stuff to
the LPC bus that I have since found not to be necessary and removed in
patches that have been applied to the mm tree and were pushed to
mainline this week.  Can anyone verify if this is still happening with
the -mm patch?
Regards,
Kylie
