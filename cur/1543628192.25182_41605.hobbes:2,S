This is the one thing I let through back in 1984. Nixdorff wanted to use
parts of the processID for processorID. Now I don't have my authors' copy
of XPG/1 CAE anymore, but I still have a lasting sense of chagrin that as
trivially exhausted resource as a pid had bits shaved off for mid-80s SMP
machines. Granted, our pid_t of the time was 16 bits, and an Intel HyperCube
made a big dent in the remaining bits-for-pid'ing, and current pid_t's on
32-bit boxen is is 32 bits, and MPP boxes are few and far between -- but
really large clusters are possible.
