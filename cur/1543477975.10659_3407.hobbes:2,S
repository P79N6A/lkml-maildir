Actually, here at work I have a Gateway GP5-200 (200mmx w/128mb SDRAM
memory).  I have to run NT4.0 (blech) for email (our old Exchange 4.0 server
doesn't have POP or IMAP) mostly.  I can run the Oracle Developer/2000 via X
from the Alpha/VMS server.  But I also have 2.2.0-pre7-ac2 on this machine.
Yesterday still I had to put the command-line mem=128M (for LILO) or it
would only see 64mb memory.
I have an M-Tech motherboard at home with a Cyrix 6x86 (thinking about
getting an M2 to replace it or maybe a K6-x, depending on the cost).  I have
96mb (2-16 and 2-32 mb 72-pin SIMMS) on the MB there and 2.2.0-pre6-ac4 (and
the older 2.2.0-prex) sees all 96mb of memory.
At home I boot from a floppy (dd if=vmlinuz of=/dev/fd0) and here at work
I've added Linux to the NT boot choices menu and copied the bootsect to the
C:.
If anyone needs more info on this Gateway let me know.

Yes: it's meant to punish you from using old kernel versions.
