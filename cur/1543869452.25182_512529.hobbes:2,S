Hey John, I had to do this already in order to do the dynticks
port to sparc64, but nice to see another attempt :-)
Two things I did on my side:
+	.mask           = 0xffffffffffffffffLL,
I used CLOCKSOURCE_MASK(64) here.
+static cycle_t read_sparc64_cpuclock(void)
+{
+        return (cycle_t)get_cycles();
+}
 ...
+	.read           = read_sparc64_cpuclock,
You can just directly assign tick_ops->get_tick to .read at run-time
to avoid a stack frame and function call/return.
+	.shift          = 16,
These shift selections all seem rather arbitrary.
If it's not an arbitrary selection, it would be nice to have some
comments about how to go about choosing an appropriate shift.
I imagine the selections has to do with the possible range of
the frequencies the clocksource supports, and how much
accuracy you get for certain shift selections given that range.
