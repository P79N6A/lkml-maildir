That's a good point.  Nice eye.
There are three routes in here: boot-time init, an ACPI call, and a
write to a sysfs file.  Bootmem is taken care of.  The write to a sysfs
file can't happen yet because userspace isn't up.
The only question would be about ACPI.  I _guess_ an ACPI event could
come in at any time, and could hit this race window.  
One other thought I had was to add an argument to memmap_init_zone() to
indicate that the memory being fed to it was contiguous and did not need
the validation checks.
Anybody have thoughts on that?
