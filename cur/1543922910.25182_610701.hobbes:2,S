That seems to follow the convention better with respect to 
memory_spread_page and memory_spread_slab anyway.  Either all the tasks 
attached to the cpuset get that behavior or none of them do.  We can do 
the same for memory_spread_user.
Sounds good.

Sure, I don't see any compelling reason why it shouldn't.

Hmm.  At some point we're going to have to just say that if you use 
mempolicies such as MPOL_BIND in your application and then you insanely 
take those nodes away from your application via cpusets, that you are 
actually getting exactly what you asked for.
There's two ways to fix that: try to remap the MPOL_BIND nodes onto the 
new set of mems_allowed regardless of the cardinality of the two sets, or 
refuse to update the nodemask of the cpuset if you're taking one or more 
nodes away from an attached task that has such a policy.  I favor the 
former because, in conjunction with a sane memory_migrate setting, it 
shouldn't actually matter that much.  The memory you previously allocated 
will still be on the removed nodes; only your future allocations will 
actually respect the new nodemask.
The MPOL_INTERLEAVE case is more interesting because we're trying to 
reduce bus contention and decrease our latency with quicker memory access.  
So, using the true definition of a node as a premise, we should get better 
results in terms of performance if we expand the nodemask as much as 
possible.  That's exactly what we've been trying to address: when an 
application's mems_allowed is expanded to allow more nodes, the 
application is unaware of the change and can't take advantage of the 
it (without the get_mempolicy() - set_mempolicy() loop).  That's my whole 
case for why cpusets should be modifying MPOL_INTERLEAVE policies in the 
first place: because they are the ones that allowed access to more memory.

Keeping a copy of the nodemask passed to set_mempolicy() in struct 
mempolicy is an interesting idea and could, with the logic you describe, 
help guide the remapping as the set of allowed nodes changes.  We'd have 
two interleaved nodemasks, the actual (pol->v.nodes) and the requested 
(something like pol->passed_nodemask).  get_mempolicy() would always 
return the actual nodemask so the application can be aware of what it has 
access to and what it doesn't.  I like it.
