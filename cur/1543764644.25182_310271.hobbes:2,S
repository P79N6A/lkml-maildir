Even RedHat with a stronger financial background than Debian considered 
the MP3 patents being serious enough to remove MP3 support.
Yes, Debian can choose to put a higher risk on their distributors and 
mirrors - there's nothing wrong with this.
Note that this is a respose to Josselin's statement:

When there are several possible interpretations, you have to pick up the
more conservative one, as it's not up to us to make the interpretation,
but to a court.

It's simply silly to be extremely picky on copyright issues while being 
extremely liberal on patent issues - the risk of a Debian distributor 
being sued for patent violations (no matter how the lawsuit might end) 
is definitely present.
