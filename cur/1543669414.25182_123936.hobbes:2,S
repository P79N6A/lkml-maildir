Subject: 2.4.21pre7 : amd74xx+nForce2+DMA+CD-RW = hang

Hi,
I'm using 2.4.21pre7 on an Asus A7N8X board (nForce2).
It looks like DMA can't be enabled on this chipset using Generic PCI IDE 
support, so I went with the amd74xx driver.
What happens is the following, when attempting to write a CD on an ATA33 
Yamaha burner with DMA enabled:
cdrecord advances way too quickly to the 7th Mbyte of data (it says 137x 
speed), and then it stays there (I waited for a long time...).
Two ctrl-c's can interrupt it, but the machine freezes after a while anyway, 
or even instantly if trying "cdrecord -reset"
I've verified that this is linked to DMA being enabled or not (by unloading 
the scsi modules, loading the ide ones, hdparm'ing DMA away, and loading back 
scsi)
BTW, before this can be fixed, how does one disable DMA for a particular 
device on the kernel cmdline ?
Here are relevant kernel messages:
