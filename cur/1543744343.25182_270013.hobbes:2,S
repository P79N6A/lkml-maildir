Hello,
Applying the patch "patch-2.6.10-rc1.bz2" results in one empty file,
"arch/arm/mach-iop3xx/arch.c". This is probably because the "+++"-line
in the patch sets the file name to something else than "/dev/null". 
This itself is not a problem, just use "patch -E" to apply it.
My concern is that other files in the patch are using "/dev/null" like
"arch/ia64/sn/io/Makefile" so they are removed correctly.
Why the mix of empty and removed files?
Thanks!
