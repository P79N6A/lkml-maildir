I've made some more tests. More importantly, the additional power
consumption comes from my (new) external hard disk drive. When it's not
connected, the system consume 69 W at idle, regardless of the config
options.
I guess that the drive was being autosuspended (by CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND)
only when CONFIG_SUSPEND was set. But as I found that my drive never
comes back from autosuspend, it's now blacklisted, and my system
consumes 80 W again even with CONFIG_SUSPEND=y.
If I rmmod "ehci-hcd" then the power consumption is back to 69 W. This
confirms that this is really USB-related. I have to admit that I did
not expect an external drive to eat that much power from the system,
especially when not used. I am told that VIA chips are notoriously bad
at this kind of things. I'll try the same external drive on an Intel
system later today.
The last mystery remaining is how USB "activity" can cause my CPU to
heat. I would expect the south bridge to heat, not the CPU.
Thanks,
