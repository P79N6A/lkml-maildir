An uniform implementation for a totally non uniform set of processors. Not
actually useful. The x86 is one of the few cpus so short of registers that
current in a global register is not a win performancewise.
The cache behaviour also heavily depends on the processor. In paticular the
problem with having to align stacks to do current tricks is absent on non
x86 processors so they can use properly coloured stacks. 
current is far too critical to generalise
