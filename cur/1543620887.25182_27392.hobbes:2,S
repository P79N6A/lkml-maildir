Some of you may experience compile problems with quota with XFS. I'm
working on a patch to be ready for today.
NOTE: Two people have reported problems with XFS + EXT3/EXT2. People
report the kernel unable to locate superblocks of EXT2/EXT3 filesystems
with XFS compiled in. Looking for help on this issue and researching. 
I'll be also intregrating 2.4.18-pre9-ac1 as well today.
Shawn.
