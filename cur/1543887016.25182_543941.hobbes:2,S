Yes, however the point here is that you can easily (and temporarily)
blacklist a module *manually* from the boot loader without needing to 
actually perform a complete and successful boot. Using modprobe's 
blacklist requires editing /etc files, and it also doesn't apply 
for initrd/initramfs or other system/distribution-specific scripts 
that would do hardcoded sequential insmod invocations (for example
on embedded systems that require minimal userspace complexity).
