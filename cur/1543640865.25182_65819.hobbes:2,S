If the app dies, it should drop you in something like a shell that
should probably simply have the same keyboard decoding code. Or maybe
something smarter. It could use the something like my empeg is using
when searching for song titles.
Press 5 (JKL), all songs starting with either j, k, or l will be
selected, and the display shows 'Kind of Magic'. Press 3 (DEF) and it
limits the selection to any songs that have one of those letters in the
second place. Then press 8 (TUV) and we get 'Let It Be'. So with 3
keypresses I just picked a song out of a selection of almost 1000. I
guess Nokia is doing something similar based on a dictionary.
(or drop back into a menu which doesn't even need key translation)
In any case, how the keys are interpreted is very much application
specific, and can be implemented in a userspace library. I really do not
think it is a good idea to put a complete dictionary or other list of
possible completions in kernel space to implement such alternative input
methods.

If you really _have_ to write it low-level in the kernel, it sounds like
a class assignment, in which case you really shouldn't be asking for
existing implementations.
