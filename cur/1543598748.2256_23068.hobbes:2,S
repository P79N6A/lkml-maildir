I too am having trouble powering off and rebooting an SMP machine.  It
is a Tyan Tiger 230.  I have tried to report this a few times with
little to no response.  The last kernel that worked for me in this
respect was 2.4.6-ac2.  I have tried linus' and alan's kernels both with
no success.  I have tried configuring all kernel with APM soft-power
off, real-mode power off (I enable power-off even though the rest of APM
is broken on SMP), ACPI (multiple setups), and nothing at all.  None of
these kernel/configuration combos allow me to shutdown or reboot my
machine.  I would like to be able to and I know the board still works
because Windows 2000/XP (even though I hate using them) both manage to
shutdown/reboot the machine properly.  I have everything I can think of
copiled in statically instead of as modules and also have PNPBIOS enable
in the kernel and the BIOS.  Any help would be appreciated.
