hmmmm.
Honestly I would rather just remove the VIA support from the kernel 
completely:  it belongs in the userspace rngd 
(
http://sf.net/projects/gkernel/
)
I've been meaning to do this for a while, wanna volunteer?  ;-)
The current code is stable and doesn't need module parameters, so I 
would prefer to just modify userspace rngd instead.
