That's a kernel error message.  Something is a bit hosed up in one
of your drivers, or you're having a hardware problem.
The first thing you need to do is to find out what function corresponds
to 00112345.  If you don't have a kernel symbol table, you can get this
information from 
               strings /proc/ksyms | sort  | less
Look for the the function that covers 00112345, i.e., a start address
lower than that number, followed by a start address higher than that number.
once you've found the name of the function, you can search though the
kernel source to find out what driver/kernel portion defines that
function.
Once you've found that, you'll either want to swap out hardware or contact
the maintainer of that portion of the kernel.  I had something
similar with some of the 3Com ethernet cards, and I found out that
other people were having problems with it also.  I got rid of the
3com, replaced it with a tulip-based card, and haven't had the 
problem since.
See /usr/src/linux/README for more info.
