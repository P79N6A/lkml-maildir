Isn't it that Linux may write data before writing metadata, so it could
write the data, but it doesn't show up in the (on-disk) file? As a result,
FFS might give you a file with garbage (allocated blocks that were never
written to), Linux might give you a short file (or loose it completely). Is
that correct?
Next question, how long are the respective windows of vulnerability to a
crash? To the next sync(2), i.e., on average 15s?
If the above is true, it looks like both are roughly equally vulnerable,
but I'd prefer the Linux failure mode.
