Could you please make a diagram of such a race ?

Oh I see:
CPU0			CPU1
try_to_swap_out()	swapin readahead
get_swap_page()
			valid_swaphandles()
			swapduplicate()
add_to_swap_cache()
			add_to_swap_cache()
BOOM.
Is that what you mean ?

Right. Now I see that the diagram I just wrote (thanks for making me
understand it :)) has been there forever. Ugh.
