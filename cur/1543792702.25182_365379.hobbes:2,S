The mmap() code in the kernel in your module contains the physical
location of the memory-mapped data as the third parameter to
remap_pfn_range(a, b, c, d, e);
                       |____________ here.
Your code should have put the bus address of your memory
into that location as PAGES, which means you shifted it right
by PAGE_SHIFT. If you got your memory from get_dma_pages()
or similar, you needed to convert the virtual address using
virt_to_bus() so you already have the virtual address. If
not, you need to get the virtual address by taking this
page address and shifting it left by PAGE_SHIFT. Then you
convert that address to virtual using bus_to_virt().
