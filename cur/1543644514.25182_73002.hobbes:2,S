Current bitkeeper has 
#define BIO_MAX_PAGES           (256)
That's a megabyte.  It works fine with mpage.c.  But direct-io.c
is still using BIO_MAX_PAGES.  It really is building 1 megabyte
BIOs, which will break just about every device out there.
I think we just ask Linus to do the below until we get it fixed up?
