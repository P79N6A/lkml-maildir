Yes, we will likely need to place the conters in memory closest to
the corresponding CPUs.
I haven't yet started looking at the current NUMA proposals, but
I hope that there will be support for NUMA-aware allocations. The
flexible allocator scheme in our statctr implementation allows
each counter block corresponding to a CPU to be allocated separately
and we can make the locational judgement at that time as indicated
in my hypothetical changes to the statctr code snippet.
Thanks
