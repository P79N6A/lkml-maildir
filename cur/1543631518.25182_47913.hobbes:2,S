Hello, Dipankar,
I would prefer to use the existing slab allocator for this.
I am not sure if I understand your requirements for the per-cpu
allocator correctly, please correct me if I do not.
What I would like to see
1. Have per-cpu slabs instead of per-cpu cpucache_t. One should
   be able to tell for which caches we want per-cpu slabs. This
   way we can make even kmalloc per-cpu. Since most of the kernel
   would use and dispose memory before they migrate across cpus.
   I think this would be useful, but again no data to back it up.
2. I hate the use of NR_CPUS. If I compiled an SMP kernel on a two
   CPU machine, I still end up with support for 32 CPUs. What I would
   like to see is that in new kernel code, we should use treat equivalent
   classes of CPUs as belonging to the same CPU. For example
   void *blkaddrs[NR_CPUS];
   while searching, instead of doing
   blkaddrs[smp_processor_id()], if the slot for smp_processor_id() is full,
   we should look through
   for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
     look into blkaddrs[smp_processor_id() + i % smp_number_of_cpus()(or
whatever)]
     if successful break
   }
On a two CPU system 1,3,5 ... belong to the same equivalent class. So we
might
as well utilize them. Even with a per-cpu pool, threads could use the slots
in
the per-cpu equivalent classes in parallel (I have a very rough idea about
this).
Does any of this make sense,
Balbir

|If static percpu area is around, can dynamic percpu data allocator
|be far behind ;-)
|
|As a part of scalable kernel primitives work for higher-end SMP
|and NUMA architectures, we have been seeing increasing need
|for per-cpu data in various key areas. Rusty's percpu area
|work has added a way in 2.5 kernels to maintain static per-cpu
|data. Inspired by that work, I have implemented a dynamic per-cpu
|data allocator. Currently it is useful to us for -
|
|1. Per-cpu data in dynamically allocated structures.
|2. per-cpu statistics and reference counters
|3. Per-cpu data in drivers/modules.
|4. Scalable locking primitives like local spin only locks
|   (or even big reader locks).
|
|Included in this mail is a document that describes the allocator.
|I would really appreciate if people comment on it. I am
|particularly interested in eek-value of the interfaces,
|specially the bit about keeping the type information in
|a dummy variable in a union.
|
|The actual patch will follow soon, unless someone convince
|me quickly that there is an saner way to do this.
|
|Thanks
