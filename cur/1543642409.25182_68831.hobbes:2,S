cpufreq for Speedstep seems to have broken since -ac1.  On my Mobile P3, the
boot message appears to identify my cpu clock speeds properly and displays
them:
CPU clock: 731.500 MHz (731.500-1130.500 MHz)
but the files in /proc display like this:
speed: 0
speed-min: 1104151299
speed-max: 0
speed-sync: 1
And any attempt to set the speed results in an Oops (divide by zero in
time_cpufreq_notifier).
