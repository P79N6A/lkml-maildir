You are running one of the kernels not a lot of people outside of red hat
know the details about.

This kind of hardware just asks for 2.6. Furthermore, you'll find that
current kernel hackers will be in a far better position to help you.

In a recent kernel, you will probably be able to use the tg3 driver instead
of this vendor supplied one, which is generally considered to be inferior or
at least uglier than the in kernel one.

2.6 also has a built-in ksymoops, which gives far more reliable results.
Good luck!
