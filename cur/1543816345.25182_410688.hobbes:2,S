Yep, I implemented in fact an extension of the call, via setting a ptrace 
option.

Indeed it is simpler to do PTRACE_CHECKEMU than to set an option and do 
PTRACE_SYSEMU, but a quick read I felt that doing so adds additional 
complication to the code... (mostly in the flag setting in arch_ptrace()).
Also, I've to look well at your changes to do_syscall_trace() to judge about 
them. The logic used is different from the one I wrote, though it seems valid 
too. Until I look well (and I've not the time now) I won't be able to see 
whether it's an improvement or not.

Ok, if I'm not missing anything this is the "better interface" we talked 
about.

Yes, but the "large gap" is achieved by the initial checking of the 
tsk_thread_flag.

This "if" has probably become too large - better separate into an inline(?) 
function the common code and split all request in different "case 
PTRACE_XXX:" labels.

Argh - PTRACE_CHECKEMU shouldn't be 33, it was wrong from me to do so, I've 
been taught only subsequently, and it shouldn't be in linux/ptrace.h; either 
use the arch-independent range 0x4200-0x4300 (which is the better road IMHO) 
or move it to asm-i386/ptrace.h:

Indeed, I already moved PTRACE_SYSEMU* to asm-i386, because their value 
conflicted with another ptrace code, on another arch.
