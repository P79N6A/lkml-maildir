Yes, you are right, it is not a compiler bug.
My apologies to the GCC team, in case anyone has read it.

Indeed the compiler has to assume that any memory location has changed.

There is one, it says that cs and ct address structures with 4 gigabyte size.
This is anyway not 64 bit clean.
static inline int strcmp(const char * cs,const char * ct)
{
        int d0, d1;
        register int __res;
        __asm__ __volatile__(
                        "1:\tlodsb\n\t"
                        "scasb\n\t"
                        "jne 2f\n\t"
                        "testb %%al,%%al\n\t"
                        "jne 1b\n\t"
                        "xorl %%eax,%%eax\n\t"
                        "jmp 3f\n"
                        "2:\tsbbl %%eax,%%eax\n\t"
                        "orb $1,%%al\n"
                        "3:"
                        :"=a" (__res), "=&S" (d0), "=&D" (d1)
                        :"1" (cs),"2" (ct),
                        "m" ( *(struct { char __x[0xfffffff]; } *)cs),
                        "m" ( *(struct { char __x[0xfffffff]; } *)ct));
        return __res;
}
Now, how do i formally submit this as a bug report ?
Andreas.
