As I did not really follow the ongoing work that time I will believe you
here.
So I am left to my statement that Suspend 2 worked for nearly one year,
where swsusp still has issues.

In this case swsusp wanted to restore an already invalid image (had a
reboot with fsck before) which would have resulted in filesystem
corruption. If you are able to stop the resume process with ^C that is
fine, but that needs the "ugly" eventhandler in the kernel (which I
think is not so ugly at all).
As I said, this situation was partly my own fault, and we do not need to
discuss this further. It just reminds me on the bad things that could be
happen.

I think most patches were already submitted upstream. And I think we all
agree that this is the way how it should happen.
So, cleanups are still necessary, and I believe Nigel mentioned that he
is already working on it.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I see your comments are about Suspend 2.2,
while a lot of this was already be fixed in 2.2.0.1.
And Nigel has taken your points and preparing a new patch. So let see
when it is ready.

Using -mm is not an issue for me at the moment, so I cannot test it. I
will believe you with that, however I doubt that uswsusp is in any
better state than Suspend 2 when it comes to stability, reliabilty,
documentation and availability of working packages (at least I see no
userbase).
I do not say that uswsusp will not work, or never will, but I say that
it is far from finished, that is why it should be considered to use the
other solution first.

OK, for me the "right way" is to take the working solution and work
around the problems and issues that are left and prevent it from getting
into mainline.
