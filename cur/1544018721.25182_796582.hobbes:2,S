Hi Ingo,
We would like to support some more specific cases (e.g. when tying a  
pointer/int to a different size pointer/int) but we currently don't  
intend to support all cases (e.g. tying a FP value to int).  We are in  
this position because the semantics are very vague and hard to reason  
about (and change based on target endianness) and we had many subtle  
bugs in the corner cases.
Instead of having silent miscompiles, we decided to just reject all  
the "hard" cases and add them back one by one as there is demand.   
That way users could choose to modify their asms instead of having  
them be potentially silently miscompiled.
LLVM 2.5 is in its release process right now, so it will not have  
improvements in this area, but LLVM 2.6 certainly could.  If there is  
interest in building the kernel with 2.5, I think taking the patches  
would be worthwhile.  If that is hopeless anyway, waiting for the LLVM- 
side fixes should be fine.
