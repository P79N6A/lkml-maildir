This is way... off topic, but can't help myself.  Human's 20th century starts
from 1901 to 2000.  Hence, year 2000 is the last day of the 20th century.  The
calendar starts from 1 AD as the 1st year of the 1st century.  Darn, sometimes 
working with numbers on the computer for too long, we can lose ourselves in it.
