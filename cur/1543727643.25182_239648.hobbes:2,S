Poking around in arch/i386/mm/init.c finds this:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_PAE
int nx_enabled = 0;
static void __init set_nx(void)
{
        unsigned int v[4], l, h;
        if (cpu_has_pae && (cpuid_eax(0x80000000) > 0x80000001)) {
I could certainly see somebody wanting to use the NX stuff with only 2G of RAM.....
