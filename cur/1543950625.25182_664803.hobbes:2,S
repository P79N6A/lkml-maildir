Two more little bug fixes for md in 2.6.25.
One fixes a formatting error in /proc/mdstat.  Technically this is a
user-interface change for an interface that has been around since
2.6.15.  However the only program known to parse this file trips over
the error.  So I think it is safe to fix it.
The second fixes a small bug in a recent patch.
 [PATCH 001 of 2] md: Fix formatting error in /proc/mdstat.
 [PATCH 002 of 2] md: Reduce CPU wastage on idle md array with a write-intent bitmap. fix
