I disagree. It's mis-configured because right now you are using
side-effects of hard limitations as features as it's the only way for you
right now.
From an fs point of view it make no sense at all to make /tmp in a
separate fs if you don't need to play with quota or hardlinks.

If everybody did a thing in a way and I am saying you that I like to
change is exactly because I don't like such a way. It's not because I
don't know the current way.
BTW, implementing revoke(2) is not hard (there was patches floating
around) and with such a syscall we could as well avoid people to take the
file opened. Changing hardlink semantic in my way + revoke would forbid
malicious users to leak quota space of users completly. OK, we don't need
it. Discussion finished. This is a completly _different_ issue.
