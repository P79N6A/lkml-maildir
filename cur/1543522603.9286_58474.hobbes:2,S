ORBS doesn't do that until they get the try-to-relay
message back in their own mailbox.
The fact that the message was relayed back to the
ORBS server indicates that your server must be in
error.
No matter how `broken' the tests of ORBS are,
without your server relaying the message back
to them it won't get blacklisted.
