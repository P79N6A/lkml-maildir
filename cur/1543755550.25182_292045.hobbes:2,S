While I am really thinking about starting usbdump, I may ask why you
have choosen to use debugfs as interface. This will not be available in
normal distribution kernels and I think a general USB monitoring ability
would be great. For example like we have it for Ethernet, Bluetooth and
IrDA. So my idea is to create some /dev/usbmonX (for each bus one) where
usbdump can read its information from. What do you think?

Marcel
