Well, the ACL code would be depend on CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL as in XFS and
JFS.  We might want one XATTR config option for ext2/ext3 if this is a
real concern for people (it might be a good idea after thinking a bit
more about it).  IMHO we should end up with one option for xattr support
in ext2, one for xattrs in ext3 and one for all filesystems for ACLs.
