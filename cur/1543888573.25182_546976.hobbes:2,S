ah, you got the latency tracer from Thomas, as part of the -hrt patchset 
- that makes it quite a bit easier to debug. Could you run the attached 
trace-it-10sec utility:
	trace-it-10sec > trace-to-ingo.txt
and send me the (compressed) trace output (off-list, or post an URL to 
the trace)? Try to reproduce the 'lag' event in the 10 seconds while the 
tracer is running.
