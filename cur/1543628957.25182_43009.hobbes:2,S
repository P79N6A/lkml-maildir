Subject: Combined low latency & performance patches for 2.4.18

I've combined the following patches against 2.4.18:
Scheduler 0(1)
Low Latency
Preemptible
Compressed cache
new IDE subsystem
These are based on fairly recent patches, but not all are the latest.
I've noticed palpable improvements (the feel of using the machine) enabling 
all of these except for the compressed cache but have no data to support my 
feelings. The machine I tried them on was up for 3 weeks with heavy loads and 
proved to be quite stable. I've posted a combined patch at:
http://kernel.kolivas.net
Feel free to test it out and tell me what you think.
Thanks very much to those who put all the effort into each one of these 
patches.
