I've got one of those. It has the memory attached. Makes a fantastic
message bus and has a really long queue. Also features shortcuts for
messages travelling between processors in short order cache to cache.
Made by AMD and Intel.

We do 512 processors passably now. Thats a lot of cores and more than
the commodity computing people can wire to memory subsystems at a price
people will pay. 
Besides which you need to take it up with the desktop people really. Its
their apps that use most of the processor power and will benefit most
from parallelising and efficiency work.
