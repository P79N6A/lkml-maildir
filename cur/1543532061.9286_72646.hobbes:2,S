If we had a task-group notion in the kernel, we could send some
sort of signal to all tasks in the group. This gets everything
done in a task-local manner. The signal handler need not be a real
user-visible one in user address space; it could be kernel-only.
(gee, reminds me of MTRR on SMP -- Intel won't share registers)

Parent exit is blocked? I don't think so, but this is important.
Without this you can not get the right PID behavior.

Hey, I need a "task group" concept for correct ps operation anyway.

Well, of course there must be some way to link the tasks.
I'll describe one method below.

I think you need at least a placeholder thread. This would be a manager
thread that doesn't actually do anything. Without this, you can not let
threads exit as desired -- the POSIX parent (your shell) will notice.

It is easy to share PIDs. Rename the old getpid() call to gettid()
and introduce a new getpid() call. The directories in /proc should
be seen as tasks, not processes.
The new PID is:
1. set equal to TID in a new fork child
2. set equal to TID during exec
3. unchanged for non-fork clone calls
There, now you have a Linux-compatible POSIX-compatible PID
without forcing all thread packages to follow POSIX (mis-)features.
For normal threads, the initial task must exit last. It would not
be unreasonable to enforce this by making a zombie out of the
initial task; alternately the kernel could hide the reserved task
slot in some other way.

If you have no problems with embrace-and-extend, yes.
