Thanks Neil!
2.6.15 with your patch works (lets me create raid on the Promise SX8
SATA controller).
I don't quite understand why I'm the first one to hit this (the Promise
SX8 is good value for money and with decent Linux support?), but it
seems your patch is needed in both vanilla and -mm.
Thanks again, Sander
