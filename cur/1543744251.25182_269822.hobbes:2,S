You don't see any magic, unless there are merges involved. And you've 
already narrowed the thing down to a single non-merge changeset, at which 
point the "magic" way is just a very slow way of doing the same thing.
The magic hits you only when you have non-trivial merges, in which case 
the set operation shows you more than the "just walk from one top-of-tree 
to the other".
