Thanks Dave,
I finally had the chance to try out your changes.  That pesky work thing
keeps getting in my way.  So far so good, from a clean tree, they apply
fine, and fix all the other issues up to the pte_offset issues in filemap.c.
If you get to them, shoot me a copy and I'll apply and test for you.
 I see alot of warnings still from flush_dcache_page in
/include/linux/highmem.h and it looks like a duplicate declaration in
/asm-sparc64/pgalloc.h, but I have not had the chance to check that out yet.
I'll try to follow it up if you haven't seen that one yet.
On a side note, though not arch specific, if you use ramdisk, you'll need to
apply the patch below that removes second argument to bi_end_io that was
removed earlier in the series.  I have seen a patch floating around,
hopefully it will get pushed up the chain.
Thanks again for your help!
Bruce H.
