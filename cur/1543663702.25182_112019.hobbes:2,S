Dear Sir/Madam
With the recent news coverage in the UK highlighting the illegal 
practices of Customs and Excise, there is now no better time to purchase 
cheap cigarettes and tobacco online.
If you are interested in finding out more email:
cheapsmokesinfo@yahoo.co.uk
Why pay high prices for tobacco in the UK? 
A packet of cigarettes in the UK can cost up to £4.50 for a packet of 
20. We can send you legally, by registered airmail direct to your UK 
address, 800 cigarettes or 30x50g pouches of rolling tobacco (all brands 
available) from as little as 170 Euros fully inclusive of postage and 
packing. This works out at approximately £2.75 per packet. 
Do you really want to pay more? 
Kind regards 
Sales Dept
