What is important is that it all be one packaged solution from the same 
maintainer.  That is necessary for coherency of solution.
There is also benefit to it being one coherent body of code, but this is 
harder to articulate.  It is always hard to articulate why functionality 
belongs in the same program rather than split into multiple programs.  
Filesystems should provide primitives for ordering, structuring, and 
naming objects.  It is hard to say why we should do all of that, but on 
some level I just know it is our task.
