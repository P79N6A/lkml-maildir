How do you propose to do this without turning setup.c and friends
into a #ifdef nightmare ? setup_intel.c, setup_amd.c etc ??
Some of the bits I've planned for setup.c in 2.5 will make this
look not so bad. Its grown quite large, and is continuing to do so
as more and more vendors make more and more hardware bugs for us
to work around.
Splitting out things like the memory detection to a seperate
file should bring this back down to a more sensible size.
regards,
Dave.
