tune2fs -m 2 /dev/hd-whatever-hdd
For some reason linux still "eats" 5% of the hdd. This for still beeing able 
to run smooth if hdd is maxed out, or something like that.
root@vixen:~# tune2fs -m 2 /dev/hdb1
tune2fs 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Setting reserved blocks percentage to 2 (256034 blocks)
Default is 5% (slackware)
This, I think, is from way back when hdds where alot smaler and then ppl 
forgot all about it (?). 5% of an 80 gig hdd gotta be a lot of wasted space 
and in no way required. I always set it lower (2% as above) and gain more 
useable space. Probably 1% would be enough but who's counting :o)
I dont know if the tune2fs is a slackware feature only, but i doubt it. Then
again I havent really "tried" any other distro.
Inputs ?
