There's no such problem with scsi, as thousands upon thousands of
Linux users can testify.  Installing from an IDE cdrom to local scsi
is something I do regularly.  There may be hw problems with specific
motherboards or controllers, but in principle there is absolutely no
fundamental incompatibility between IDE and scsi.
