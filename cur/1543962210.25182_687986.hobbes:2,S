Yup.  I think the only sane+scalable way of making this happen is to
prevail upon the 100-odd subsystem maintainers to keep an eye out for code
which should be exposed to additional eyes.
There are of course many reasons _why_ such code needs the attention of
others, and those reasons have varying strengths.  Off the top of my head:
- modifies stuff outside the designated subsystem (eg: lib/pcounter.c -
  thanks Pavel)
- (having just spent an hour looking at drivers/net/sfc/ and having
  boggled at its bitmap.h): adds generic-looking infrastructure which
  should be in core kernel.  Or already _is_ in core kernel.
- Adds any kernel<->user interface which is not of the the most
  trivial&standard form
- Futzes with memory management internals, adds pagefault handlers, etc.
- Ditto vfs things, I guess
- In any way attempts to work around _any_ shortcoming of any other part
  of the kernel!
- Does anything RCU related.  Every time I cc Paul on an rcu-using patch,
  he finds holes in it.
- add your own here.
But we won't find such code by going out and looking for it - we do need
the recipients of that code to say "hey, others might want to see this". 
That's very low-effort for the hey-sayer, so I expect we can do better here
quite easily.
