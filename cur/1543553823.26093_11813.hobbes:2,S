I can't comment on the SysKonnect hardware/driver. However as far as
the Alteon card is concerned I know there are issues with latency just
as it has a relatively high overhead for processing DMA descriptors
(as much as 5 micro seconds). The latter is definately going to hurt
you if your part of the pissing contest is about 60 byte packets. For
real data it is not as much of a problem.
