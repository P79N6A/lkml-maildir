There are big databases of dialup address ranges from ISPs. ISPs share these
as they are one of the most useful anti spam weapons. Their 10,000 lines should
be going via their mailhub so they can say "this address range is dialup and
treat with care". Probably more people use the big lists of dialup ranges
for mailing list filters than use anything else
