Consider the case where the build machine reads source from one network 
filesystem and write the binary result to another on another machine. If 
you know that I have the kernel source on a file server, do the compiles 
on a compute server, and store the binaries on three test machines for 
evaluation, you might guess this really can happen. Just increasing the 
timestamp may not solve the problem, unless you have a system call to 
set timestamp over network f/s, like a high resolution touch.
It's a problem when there are multiple times involved.
