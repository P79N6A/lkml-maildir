i'd not mind printing out the bootup-ID as a regular part of the oops, 
as long as it's put into an unintrusive place, preferably without adding 
a new line. (just use an empty spot somewhere)
for example:
Call Trace: (ID afbf0104e2079481)
 [<ffffffff805079f6>] sysdev_driver_unregister+0x5b/0x91
 [<ffffffff806f2ef4>] cpufreq_register_driver+0x15a/0x19b
 [<ffffffff80cb0586>] powernowk8_init+0x86/0x94
