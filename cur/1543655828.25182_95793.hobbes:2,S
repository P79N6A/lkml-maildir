hi
it seems isdn4linux detects DTMF tones from normal speach. This is rather 
annoying when using i4l for voice with Asterisk.org. This is tested on all 
recent kernels
see thread "[MGCP] Asterisk/D-Link phones generates ugly DTMF tones!!!" at 
http://www.marko.net/asterisk/archives/
 for more info.
