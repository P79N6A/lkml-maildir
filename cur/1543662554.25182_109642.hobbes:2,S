Just wanted to jump in here -- I'm setting up a box using two PDC20268
controllers for a 4 drive software raid.  The system locks on heavy
disk activity only if dma is active.
I was watching this thread and put in the patch to remove the
"drive->waiting_for_dma++;" line.  I still get lockups and the message
on the console is:
hdg: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset
hdg: timeout waiting for DMA
hdg: (__ide_dma_test_irq) called while not waiting
hdg: status error: status = 0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest
}
hdg: drive not ready for command
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
PDC202XX: Primary channel reset
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
hde: (__ide_dma_test_irq) called while not waiting
I copied these -- everything with with dma disabled.  I beleive this
is the same problem, and can reproduce it (this occurred deleting a
400MB file on a reiserfs.)
The kernel is 2.4.21-pre4
The chipset is nVidia
The controllers each have their own interrupt (not shared)
I have used PDC controllers for raids in the past, but only one PDC
and the other drives used the onboard ide -- this works fine.
