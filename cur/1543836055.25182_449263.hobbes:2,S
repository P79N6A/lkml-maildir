Subject: frequent slab corruption (since a long time)

Every so often, I see a slab corruption bug reported against
the Fedora kernels (going back as far as 2.6.11), and it's
still plagueing us.
It seems to have turned up in a number of different scenarios,
which makes it all the more complicated, but the footprint is
always the same. We write ffffffff00000000 to freed memory.
All the example cases seen so far have been on 32-bit x86.
Anyone have any clues where that value could be coming from?
