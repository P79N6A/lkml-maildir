The ATI wrapper source is carefully "#if 0"ing a get_page because of the
traditional anomalous behaviour of PageReserved.  2.6.15-rc killed that
anomalous behaviour, so their "#if 0" needs to become a version test.
Big thanks to Martin Drab for testing this (and correcting the stupidity
of my original inverted patch) - tell us if it does not work for you too.
