Actually, I wasn't.  I was referring to the embedded-type ARM devices of which
I have two sat in front of me (both are manufactured within the past year so
are "current") and about half the platforms that "ARM Linux" covers have some
form of PCMCIA.
Some ARM CPUs even have the PCMCIA controller embedded within them (look at
arch/arm/tools/mach-types - each entry containing a reference to SA1100 means
that particular platform has the ability to use PCMCIA).
All of the drivers for these devices were written around the in-kernel PCMCIA
code.
