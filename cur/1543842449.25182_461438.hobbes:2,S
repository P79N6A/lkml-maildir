I agree it's probably not easy, but I think having the right
semantics is more important than fitting cleanly into the
driver model.  But I know that without code, I'm just venting
hot air, not contributing to a solution.
How's the ACPI driver model integration going, anyway?  I seem
to recall some patches a while back, but I don't think they're
in the tree yet.

I don't know.  But I think Keith already determined that a BIOS change
is not likely.  I hate to ask for BIOS changes like this because it
feels like asking them to avoid broken things in Linux.
