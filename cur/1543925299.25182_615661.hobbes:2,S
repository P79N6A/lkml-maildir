So the second run is 4x as fast as the first run?

So the 2nd and 3rd run are stable at 50% slower than .23?

Subject: mm: speed up writeback ramp-up on clean systems
We allow violation of bdi limits if there is a lot of room on the
system. Once we hit half the total limit we start enforcing bdi limits
and bdi ramp-up should happen. Doing it this way avoids many small
writeouts on an otherwise idle system and should also speed up the
ramp-up.
