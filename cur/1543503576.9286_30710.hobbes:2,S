Such a change potentially violates the standard, and at the very least,
would be non-portable.
It's also probably a bad idea due to possible priority inversion.  A
better solution might be a process that watches the load average, and if
it sees that the load is above a certain threshold, say, 0.1, it releases
all locks and sleeps for a minute.  When it wakes, it just repeats the
check to see if it is OK to run.  Put this process at nice -20, and it
would truly be a no-priority process.
One caveat is that you need to calculate the load average _minus_ that
caused by the actual process.  Another problem would be if you wanted to
run multiple no-priority process -- but then, if you care about fairness,
it's not really no-priority.
