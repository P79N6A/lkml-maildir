Hi,
I really want to test 2.4pre kernels but I don't know how
to configure my raw Mandrake 7.0 for the new kernel.
I think I'm not the only one having this problem and I propose
you to create "2.4pre testing portal" on kernelnotes or 
linuxhq sites. The web page should contain:
- instructions how to upgrade different standard distributions
  for the new kernel. It should be step-by-step instructions 
  for relatively-non-tech users to understand
- any special problems to watch out in resent kernels
- any particular devices/configurations you want us to 
  test for the resent genious fix -:)
- how and where send the bug reports
- any other info for new 2.4 testers
A good and maintained page of this kind will bring you 
a lot of new testers and rivers of bug reports.
Thank you all,
Dima.
