Wouldn't work for me as this isn't static.  saa7134 has to look at the
hardware, then decide whenever it should load saa7134-empress,
saa7134-dvb or none of them.
On the other hand I don't depend on request_module() waiting for the
modprobe being finished.  So maybe we can solve that with a
request_module_async()?
