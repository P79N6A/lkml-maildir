I hope this is not FUD or something like that, but it seems to me
the VFS guys are not too willing to implement Reiser4-HiFi stuff anywhere
else, like the VFS, and don't want Reiser4 in, because it duplicates.
Think of the chicken and the egg.
I may be wrong, though.

But it's still possible to let Reiser4 in and take them, say, a feature
at a time to the VFS.
Unless it's going to be a political wankfest/pissing contest about
if things like this should even be implemented, anywhere, ever :P
