I don't think we need to change the API. The API already exports the
format, as a fourcc-like info. We just need to add newer codes as
they'll be added into kernel.

This seems to be an interesting approach.

Yes. However, we should try to do loose coupling whenever possible, to
keep maintainership of the "library"(*) as simple as possible.
(*) With this approach, it seems that it will turn into a helper daemon,
instead of just a library.
