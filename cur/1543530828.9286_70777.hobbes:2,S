I had problems with that too.  What I did was install my kernel(s) and boot
info in my Windows partition (which is under the 1024 cylinders limit).
From the lilo documentation:
"/boot on a DOS partition
- - - - - - - - - - - -
Recent kernels support all the functions LILO needs to map files also on
MS-DOS (or UMSDOS) file systems. Since DOS partitions tend to occupy
exactly the places where BIOS restrictions (see section "BIOS
restrictions") are invisible, they're an ideal location for /boot if the
native Linux file systems can't be used because of BIOS problems.
In order to accomplish this, the DOS partition is mounted read-write, a
directory (e.g. /dos/linux) is created, all files from /boot are moved to
that directory, /boot is replaced by a symbolic link to it, the kernels are
also moved to the new directory, their new location is recorded in
/etc/lilo.conf, and finally /sbin/lilo is run.
From then on, new kernels must always be copied into that directory on the
DOS partition before running /sbin/lilo, e.g. when recompiling a kernel,
the standard procedure changes from
# make zlilo
to
# make zImage
# mv /dos/linux/vmlinuz /dos/linux/vmlinuz.old
# mv arch/i386/boot/zImage /dos/linux/vmlinuz
# /sbin/lilo
_WARNING:_ De-fragmenting such a DOS partition is likely to make Linux or
even the whole system unbootable. Therefore, the DOS partition should
either not be de-fragmented, or a Linux boot disk should be prepared (and
tested) to bring up Linux and to run /sbin/lilo after the
de-fragmentation.*
  *  Setting the "system" attribute from DOS on the critical files (e.g.
    everything in C:\LINUX) may help to protect them from being rearranged.
    However, the boot floppy should still be ready, just in case."
It was that easy for me.
