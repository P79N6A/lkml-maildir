What's sad is that this appears on the bottom of -EVERY- message that goes
to this list.

To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu
Please read the FAQ at 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/
If you cant read the unsub instructions, you need to pack up your computer
and return it, because you probably cant read the other emails you're
getting anyway.
Yes, I know, sometimes it's a tad much to ask someone to read the -entire-
email, but please.  It isn't THAT much to ask.  It isn't that hard either.
My 8 year old grandneice can do it.  Adults should be able to as well.
Dean: If you want off this list, it's simple.  Send an email to
majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu.  In the body of the email, type "unsubscribe
linux-kernel" without the quote marks.  send it.  You'll get unsubbed.
