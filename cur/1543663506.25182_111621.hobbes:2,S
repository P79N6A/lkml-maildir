Pagetables are also grossly fragmented. From the same sample:
nr_reverse_maps                   156027
To preempt the FAQ, this is the number of reverse mappings performed,
where one is done for every instantiated non-swap PTE.
$ echo $(( (689*1024)/156027.0 ))
4.5218840328917427
So the space flushed down the toilet there is also relatively large.
Approximately 4.5 PTE's per pagetable page, or a utilization of:
$ echo $(( (100*689)/156027.0 ))
0.44159023758708427
percent.
