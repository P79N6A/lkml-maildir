I'm building a new server and I get to pick the hardware; so what is
the best "ultra 2" raid 5 controller wrt Linux support?  I plan to
have qty. 4 9-gig discs and would like a controller with a good amount
of caching (raid 5 is very dependent on write caching).
How will it notify me if one of the drives goes out (it will be far,
far away from me in an unattended room)?
Hot swapping is a bonus but not too important.
Thanks!
Mark
