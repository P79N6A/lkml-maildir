Ok, there is indeed an issue in the *terminals. As above pointed out
buffering the programs output helps. Also a usleep of 5ms in the read
loop of the *terms would help.
I fixed this issue in multi-gnome-terminal by using a buffer of 32kb.
It is filled as long as there is input comming in within 10ms.
If the buffer is full or 10ms passed the buffer is written out to the
screen. This makes it also 2-3 times faster on kernel 2.4.
So in my eyes it is definitely not a scheduler bug, but in every single
terminal out there. However it seems as if kernel 2.6 s scheduling is so
fast that data can be continously outputted. And the busy loop in the
terminal makes it eat up all cpu time instead of jump scrolling take
place.
