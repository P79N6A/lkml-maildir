I have to second RMK's complaint. Testing 2.5 (in this case with x86-64)
is a major problem unless you're lucky enough to find a SCSI adapter 
and a SCSI disk. IDE just deadlocks and hangs too often. This prevents
testing everything else and stops development in 2.5 for many things.
I don't think the 2.5 release cycle can afford to lose the testers who
only have IDE machines.
