Yeah, I know ... hadn't seemed to have mirrored across when I looked,
but I grabbed it from somewhere else.

Right, it *should* work ... Andy wrote the patches to enable that so 
that distros could use a common kernel. Maybe it ought to depend on 
CONFIG_SMP + HIGHMEM_64GB as well, which would cut out most of the 
confusion, but still make it useful for distros.

No prob ... should probably be made more obvious. Are you by any chance
doing "yes | make oldconfig"? That's the obvious way to switch it on
by chance ... if so, can I recommend doing "yes '' | make oldconfig"
instead? That'll take the defaults, and work much better in general.
