Sorry Prarit, when you suggested I switch over to pci_get_slot in your 
previous comments to me, I didn't look that closely and missed the 
reference counting.  Greg, I think the required fix is just a couple of 
lines in my hotplug slot release function, I'll code it up and test it 
ASAP tomorrow with an eye on getting a patch off by early afternoon EDT.
