But you could do that even more easily if your work-area was separate.
If you do a "ls" and you get nothing back, you know you didn't have any 
crud.
Having a separate work-area doesn't mean you _have_ to check the stuff 
out.

And you can even get this behaviour too, if you were to just expand the 
(few) tools that know about SCCS to know about BK too. 
Note that it's a lot easier to expand tools that already know about 
revision control than it is to expand tools that have never known about 
it. Just grep for SCCS and make it also look for a BK tree a few 
directories up.

But the thing is that if you do it my way, you _can_ have it both ways.
If you do it your way, you cannot.

Oh, I agree - I already pointed out to Jeff that if you use the SCCS 
approach, you can never change your database, which is going to force you 
eventually to come around ;)
Note that there is another way to do all this too: it would be quite nice
(and probably not too hard) to create a filesystem that exports a BK
archive, so that you could do something like
	mount -o ro -tbk /home/BK/repository/xxxx xxx
and at least for the read-only case it should be pretty easy to make an 
intermezzo frontend to bk (ie the kernel part is already done, just the 
user-land server would be needed).
(The read-only one is the easy one to make, the read-write thing is a bit 
more involved, but potentially quite interesting)

Oh, I've tried exactly that, and it doesn't work at all for a few reasons. 
Try
	bk -r grep torvalds
in a linux tree, for a flavour of one of the problems. And for a flavour 
of another, one of the things I used to do was
	em $(find . -name '*.[chS]' | xargs grep -l '<\vfs_readdir\>')
which still works, but now I need to remember about not getting SCCS and 
BitKeeper directories, which is a pain, and make sure it's all checked out 
(which is where the filesystem support could be really nice).
Note that the filesystem approach might make your migration path easier:  
you could keep the existing BK database structure (used by the server and
legacy commands)  while migrating out one tool at a time to the "separate
tree" layout. Maybe.
