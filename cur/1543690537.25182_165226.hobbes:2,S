Do I understand that certain values of "addr" can't be due to the
erratum?
In which case, could you skip most of the is_prefetch() instruction
decoder with a test like this?:
	if ((addr & 3) == 0)
		return 0;
I'm not sure from the description of the erratum what, exactly, are
the possible addresses which can appear in the fault information.
