Do you have an ACPI-enabled machine that has no PCI?
I'm not aware of any, and would be interested to know
if one exists.
We've had problems with this theoretical build config
for some time:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1364
because nobody, including me, tests it.
Indeed, one possible fix would be to make CONFIG_ACPI
depend on CONFIG_PCI -- which brings me back to
my origianl question.
