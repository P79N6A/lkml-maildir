Dunno. That implies reservations on the Linux side - generally RT apps
are going to be sensitive to memory exhaustion. Given that, it's easier
just to budget for them all up front and carve that memory out at boot.
Not that I'm against a reservation scheme.  I've been arguing for one for
a while to avoid deadlocks with network storage.

Making subsystems of the kernel RT-safe won't buy much for them and won't
help latencies. The people who would want you to do that are from the
buzzword camp.
