I meant what I meant was that nothing should stop us from added a
different protocol.  The name could even be changed if that's an issue.
A DMA capable, 8 bit PLIP-like would be much nicer, but the lack of a
standard cable might be a show stopper.

Ok, I stand corrected.

Interrupt for each byte?  ~50 kHz interrupts would require a pretty
low latency, or am I missing your point?

Definitely negotiation/autodetection.
