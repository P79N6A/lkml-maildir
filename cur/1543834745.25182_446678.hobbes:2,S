I think that is an enormous overstatement.
My patch most certainly does not export that fact.  The only thing it provides
to userspace is a regular monotonically increasing counter independent of any
userspace scheduling.  The implementation using a regular interrupt is
completely hidden from userspace.  The rtc driver itself is whats responsible
for the global periodic interrupt.  By your logic the driver itself is a hack.
Honestly, this patch doesn't do any harm.  Any application using it currently
creates the same interrupt behavior that it would if it used the mmap interface.
I think the only argument here is that applications using other timing
facilities would create additional interrupts, but given that those applications
are using interfaces with more overhead than this one, making the switch would
be a net gain.
