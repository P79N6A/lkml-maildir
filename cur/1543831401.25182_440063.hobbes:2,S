Oh, it's just a driver update for some powermac specific thingy, so
depending how long 2.6.18 takes, I have no problem as the powermac
maintainer letting that in once it's been properly fixed and reviewed.
(Which I don't have time to do right now neither, but possibly later).
There shouldn't be significant changes to the i2c side of it from
Stelian's driver anyway, more like a new backend using the PMU.

It can stay default y as lons as it depends on PPC_PMAC (which it should
do anyway)

Agreed.
Cheers,
