Only the callbacks to scsi_done() need to be protected by
a spin_lock on host_lock. You may need to set up another
lock (driver or host specific) for the other case(s).
Unfortunately there are more problems with this driver
because it uses the old error handler scheme which has
been dropped in the lk 2.5 series. Compare the scsi_debug
driver in lk 2.5.2 with the one in lk 2.5.3-pre5 for an
example of what is involved. Start with the header and
look at the "eh_..." entries.
Good luck.
