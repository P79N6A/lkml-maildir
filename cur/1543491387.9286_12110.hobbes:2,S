OK, you've misunderstood me, then. I'm not concerned about space
saving either. I'm also trying to avoid seeks. What I was getting at
was that if you pack the data together, then read-ahead will yield
more complete files, which translates to less transactions in the end.
I don't care about saving disc space in terms of fitting all your data
onto the disc: disc is cheap. If you run out of room, buy some more.

OK, this leads me to think that you're focussed on getting all the
blocks for files in a directory in a contiguous chunk. Is this
correct?

OK, we agree on this point (see, it can happen).

If you're referring to the proposed trick of putting data inside the
inode for ext2fs, I agree. That would help for really small files, but
wouldn't help for most files. It may be worth doing anyway, as it will
have a positive effect (say for a /bin/true shell script without the
copyright;-), but people shouldn't think it solves the general
problem.

Why is this tarring step important? If instead it puts all the inode
and data blocks for all the files in a 5 MByte contiguous chunk,
what's wrong with that?
Or do you see the "put inode & data in a chunk for all the files"
operation as "tar 'em up"? If that's the case, then we've been
violently agreeing but have confused each other with different
meanings for the same terms.
We need a glossary ;-)

How often do you get a mix of people writing to the same directory,
other than /tmp? From what I've seen, most people write to their home
directory or to personal directories on shared data discs. Only rarely
have I seen a common directory used for data (AIPS), and there the
files are huge anyway (10s or 100s of MBytes and up).

Yes, agreed, but I wanted to establish a point, that the number of
seeks would be halved. I just wanted to check if you agreed with that
before going on to the next point:

Is your core point, then, that all data blocks (and secondarily, all
inode blocks) for files in a directory are contiguous on the disc?
If so, then that's good/frightening, because that's also what I
advocate. I don't recall if reiserfs does this, but I hope it does.

You're mentioning untarring, but I presume you just mean that multiple
users are somehow writing files into a FS at the same time?

By that you mean all blocks for files in a directory are in one
contiguous chunk?

I hope you at least agree with your SO ;-)
