Well, that would kind of match the locking place - the hangup might well
race with IO activity on another CPU. That's exactly the sequence that was
protected by the global irq lock.

Just regular IO on its own shouldn't trigger this, I _think_ (no hangup
event).
Although I can actually imagine the "flush_to_ldisc()" racing with itself
on a pty (with the master flushing the slave as the slave flushes itself),
so maybe it could actually happen.. But if your pty tests closed the
master and forced hangups that way, the race would be more likely.
Do you still have the pty stress-test program?

Yeah, that hangup path is one of the nastier tty events, and it's also oen 
that doesn't get much testing in many "normal" loads.
