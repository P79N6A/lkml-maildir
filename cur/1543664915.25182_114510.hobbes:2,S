Ok don't worry about upgrading kernels for now, (Disclaimer: I'm no NFS 
expert). it looks like there might have been a race here.
Code: Bad EIP value
[rpc_call_sync+121/164]
[rpc_run_timer+0/240]
It looks like a possible race with rpc_execute and possibly the timer, 
although i can't be certain where the other cpus are. Do the other oopses 
look somewhat similar? Could you supply them?
