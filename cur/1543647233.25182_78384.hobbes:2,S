Good point. Splitting up the big Config.in files is a good idea anyway, 
and it becomes even more important when the Config.help information was 
included in the file.
However, I disagree with the naming - I'd rather have one common name for
the "main" directory entry than have magic rules like "basename of the
directory capitalized". I don't want to have to search for it.
I also think I'd perfer to have them all start with the same thing, so 
that (again) it's clear when a directory has multiple configuration files. 
So instead: how about just "Config" for the main per-directory
configuration file, with sub-config's being "Config.3c5xx" and
"Config.rrunner".
