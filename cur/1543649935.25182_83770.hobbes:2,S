My assumption was that the only case in which schedule_timeout() would
return without completing the sleep is if the process was delivered a
signal. So I break the loop immediately in that case. I presume from
your explanation that schedule_timeout() may return for some other reason
(out of curiousity, what?)...and in that case I need to check for a
pending signal, exit if there is one, otherwise schedule_timeout() for
the remaining time. Am I getting warmer?
