I did look at both, the alsa documentation wasn't that clear.
It doesn't say what fm_port is, in what order the parameters are.

Ah, didn't find that.
I tried using things like:
snd-sb16=1,0,card1,0,0x220,-1,-1,7,1,5,0
But when booting the kernel with that parameter, just after
"booting the kernel", it reboots.  Without that parameter it
boots normally.
