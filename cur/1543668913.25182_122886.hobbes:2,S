It seems prepatch 2.4.21-pre7 changes ac97_codec.c without making
matching changes in ac97_codec.h... Just a heads up.
The changes to ac97_codec.c are isolated enough so that I could easily
reverse that part of the patch to get it to work.
I'm not subscribed to this list, please CC me on any responses.
Thanks.
