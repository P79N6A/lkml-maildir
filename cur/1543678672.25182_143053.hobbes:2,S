Hi,
Here are some small USB fixes and cleanups for 2.5.72.  Biggest thing
here was deleting a driver that wasn't being built or used anymore.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/linus-2.5
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
