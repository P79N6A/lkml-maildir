Subject: [PATCH] i386 - sys_clone from vsyscall
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/11/241

This patch fixes a little problem when sys_clone is called from a
vsyscall and a new stack
for the child is specifed.
Some regs, and return address are pushed in the stack before sysenter,
so when the syscall returns, pop the regs and return, if we made a new
stack for the thread
we need to copy that to the new stack or the thread will segfault.
Sorry for use the 0xffffe410 constant I didn't find another way to reference it.
And sorry for my english :S
