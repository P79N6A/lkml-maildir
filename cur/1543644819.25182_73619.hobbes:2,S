Oh boy, this is the material bad jokes are made from ...
Q: How many lightweight patch managers does it take to do a
   singly linked list list_del ?
A: 4, two to hold down the list head, one to chop off the tail
   and another one to sweep the lost entries under the carpet.
Sorry, but I couldn't resist this one ;)
