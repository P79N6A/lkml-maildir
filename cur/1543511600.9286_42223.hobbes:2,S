2.2.12  SMP  (2 processors)
I just had a mysterious kernel lockup... no oops, panic or anything.
System load was light..  about 170 MB of free memory (buffers) so memory
wasn't a problem.  (This time!)
Network, console, everything just locked up tight.  The hard disks were
quiet as well.
Could some of these SMP races I've heard about be the cause?
