I thought the fan turns slower because the CPU generates
less heat, which in turn is because it consumes less
electrical energy.
If someone has done measurements I'd be interested to
know the numbers about the actual power savings which
can be achieved by using P4 clock mod. I don't expect
it to be much, but I bet it's more than 1W.
