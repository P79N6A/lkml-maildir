There is no way your system should be going into swap under these conditions 
- it's a bug.  We have probably fixed this already.

Um, no, sorry.  This should not be necessary.

Please try 2.4.9 and 2.4.8-ac10.  If the system slows down, look in your logs 
and see if there are any "allocation failed" messages.  Use top or do watch 
cat /proc/meminfo to be sure your system isn't going into swap, and please 
let us know what happens.
