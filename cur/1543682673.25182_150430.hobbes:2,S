I'll probably stick with the kernel param. I'm not the best of coders 
 (and no where near kernel-level). Course, that's why I'm here.
Still, I was wondering why it (synaptics) was putting sync errors even 
when I was in console mode. It was almost as it couldnt decode the 
output of the touchpad.

I dont even have GPM on my laptop. I had enough troubles dealing with 
Slack and its incessant need of default choosing GPM.
I'm still green when it comes to understanding interals, but thanks for 
explaining what was probably a dumb question.
