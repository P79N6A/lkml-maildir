OK.  I was just trying really hard to find potential API problems earlier
rather than later, obviously without taking the time to completely
understand the VLAN layer internals :)
I don't see why it wouldn't be desirable to have a method of stopping the
driver from continuing to call vlan_hwaccel_rx, so that the vlan_group could
be freed after all the VIDs were removed.  It could be as simple as
declaring that dev->vlan_rx_register(dev, NULL) is valid.
