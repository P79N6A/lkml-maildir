But how do you know what to wait for?
If you modprobe a usb-storage driver, and the usb bus is not done
discovering devices, the insmod will instantly return, and only some
time later will the device node be created after the device is
discovered by the bus and then passed to the module you already loaded.
Sitting and waiting is a band-aid, I agree.  That's why we created the
/etc/dev.d/ notifier system to fix this issue (that is there for systems
that don't even use udev.)
