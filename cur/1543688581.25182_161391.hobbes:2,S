Thanks for the pointer to the benchmarks.
The patch I posted only helps the mmap case so it
won't help (or hurt hopefully ;-) any program that
primarily does read/write instead of mmap.  The
extreme case where I observed this was a perl script
that created a gigantic hash and tried to populate it.
 The perl in question uses mmap for malloc.  The
difference in execution time between stock 2.4.22 and
one with the patch was insignificant because it is
primarily I/O bound, however the other apps I was
running, Mozilla and several xterm's, were paged out
much less frequently in the latter case.  The machine
has 256MB of memory and perl grew to about 1 GB.
I have written another patch that more aggresively
tries to free pages with dirty buffers which should
help with the buffer I/O case.  It essentially changes
try_to_free_buffers() so it immediately starts and
waits for I/O to complete if the gfp_mask allows it. 
It does not do any clustering so its performance is
questionable at the moment.
