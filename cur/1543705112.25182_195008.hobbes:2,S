Possibly "when they do" should've been "if they do" to clarify what I
meant.  I don't mean that dropping all superfluous parantheses are
necessarily good, but most of the time, people tend to sprinkle the code
with them just because they lack in their knowledge of basic
C-programming.  I'm not saying this is the case for the kernel, just
that I've seen it far too often.
I agree about the sub-expression bit though.
