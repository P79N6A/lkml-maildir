     Is this a tulip or networking problem?  I was poking around with
     dhclient the other day (trying to get a dhcp client that would work
     on both 2.0 and 2.3) and brought the interface up and now a few
     times.   As I recall, the NETWORK would break if I brought the
     interface down -- I think that it was gluing routes to the
     interface and ignoring both route and ifconfig's attempts to say
     "no, really, when we bring the fucking interface down we mean it" --
     but if I rmmod'ed the tulip driver and put it back in it would flush
     the routes and work again.

     david parsons \bi/ I think it's documented, so it's become a feature
                    \/                                   instead of a bug :-(
