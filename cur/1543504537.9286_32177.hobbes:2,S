I think it was me who added these exports, they do not depend on
sysctl but are used by the general networking code. I asume the reason
they are labelled sysctl_foo is because they are also accessible via
the sysctl interface.
However these variables must be exported even if sysctl is disabled as
some devices (HIPPI which have a 64KB MTU) needs to be able to set
larger default socket buffer limits to work correctly.
