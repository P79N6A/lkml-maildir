Let's end this thread shall we.
Anyone talking about scalability without talking about workload and
measurement is just spreading BS.
Anyone can get 100% (or even superlinear) scalability on a 1000
processor i486 with a 1 KHz bus, if the workload is right and
performance is measured "right".
The same person can get negative scalability on any THz (my-privates-
are-longer-and-fatter-than-yours)-bus machine out there, if the workload
is again chosen "correctly".
The thread could have gone on-topic, but it didn't   :)
