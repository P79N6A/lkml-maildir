OK, I'll work around the cmpxchg locally.
But for the record, I am concerned with the API inflation
instigated by the single source. The scheduler-specific
bitmaps were bad enough, even though Bill Irvin showed
a better way to do it at the time. Now, the same gentleman
invents one more API. I may be getting senile, though.
