I've just noticed that my USB controller(s) show up as having "Wrong
ID" and now I'm wondering what exactely that means and what I can do
about it  (kernel 2.6.13-rc6-mm1 in case it matters).
Is it a wrong PCI ID? If so, how's the controller recognized at all?
I stopped by 
http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/iii//
 which had an entry saying :
0925	VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID)
    	Wrong ID used in subsystem ID of VIA USB controllers.
but that doesn't whed much light for me.
Here's a snippet from lspci : 
00:04.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0
controller] (rev 16) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
        Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID) USB Controller
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV+ VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium
>TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 32, cache line size 08
        Interrupt: pin D routed to IRQ 3
        Region 4: I/O ports at d400 [size=32]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
00:04.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6202 [USB 2.0
controller] (rev 16) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
        Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID) USB Controller
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV+ VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium
>TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 32, cache line size 08
        Interrupt: pin D routed to IRQ 3
        Region 4: I/O ports at d000 [size=32]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
Can anyone explain this to me?     The controllers are working just
fine, so it's not too important, I'm just a currious nature :)
