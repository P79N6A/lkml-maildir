It's less work long term, mostly because all the rejects for sysctl.h will 
go away. And it's more compatible than just removing sysctl(2) completely.
The main reason i think at least emulating KERN_VERSION is a good idea is that
it will save a bit of time with older executables who do this 
on every startup. /proc/sys/* is a little slow to do that often.
Normally sysctls are not that time critical so this is really a 
exception.
