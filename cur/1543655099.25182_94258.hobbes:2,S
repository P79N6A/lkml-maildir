This machine will die due to buffer_heads which are attached
to highmem pagecache, and due to inodes which are pinned by
highmem pagecache.

This will evict the highmem pagecache.  That frees the buffer_heads
and unpins the inodes.

I guess talk to Red Hat.  These are well-known problems and there
should be fixes for them in a "bigmem" kernel.
Otherwise, the -aa kernels have patches to address these problems.
One option would be to roll your own kernel, based on a kernel.org
kernel and a matching patch from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/

Hard.  The relevant patches are:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1/05_vm_16_active_free_zone_bhs-1
and
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1/10_inode-highmem-2
The first one will not come vaguely close to applying to an
RH 2.4.18 kernel.
The second one may well apply, and will probably fix the problem.
