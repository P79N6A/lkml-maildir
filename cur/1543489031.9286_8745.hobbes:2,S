Hello,
I've found out that thekernel looses many ticks when I switch the 
virtual console using Alt+Fx. It could be the key combination, or it 
could be the console switching per se. I don't know which, but maybe 
someone can find it easily.
(I have been working in X11 for hours, and no multiple lost ticks 
occured, but when I switchd virtual consoles, many of them appeared 
within few minutes)
Regards,
Ulrich
