Hi!
I've seen reports of simmilar problems from time to time, but none recently.
I've seen no explanation to the cause of these errors, nor any fix, but I've had
these errors on two different machines, so the problem might still exist. Also,
I sometimes get FS corruption, so any help on this problem would be greatly
appreciated.
I get these errors every few weeks on one of my machines running 2.2.18 with
only IDE disks, e2fs only. (hda2 is my root fs)

I have no idea where to start looking, but if someone have any ideas, I'll
try to help track this down.
