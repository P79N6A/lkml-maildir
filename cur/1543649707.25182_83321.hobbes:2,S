It's not so much a matter of "clean up" as "write to begin with"

And this is the second time I'm saying that I agree that it is the wrong
thing to do; I don't want to do it; I withdraw my request for the new
ARPHRD type; and again ask the question:
Do the network core &| protocol stacks have any dependencies on
(skb->mac.raw - skb->data) being the same as netdev->hard_header_len?
I'm asking you if the core networking stuff can handle variable-length
headers coming off of one netdev.   
Can I assume it generally works, or is it generally broken? You seem to
be implying the latter.

The ethernet drivers are not broken.  The generic ethernet code is not
broken.  802.11 headers are not a "special case" of 802.[23] headers. 
If anything is broken wrt variable headers, it would be net/ipv4 or
some other protocol stack.  
So, what do you want me to do?
0) go away
1) audit the use of hard_header_len in net/* and submit fixes
2) write an 802.11 equivalent of the code in eth.c
3) mangle eth.c to handle 802.11 &| variable headers and fix all
    drivers that inevitably break
Bleh.
