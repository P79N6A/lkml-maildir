Very minor bug - printk with two '%d's and one int to print out.
Lines 853-854 of drivers/char/istallion.c (kernel 2.6.6)
Code is an error message 'failed to un-register tty driver'
CC-ing the kenel list, since the manufacturer of the device
that driver's for has changed hands, and the maintainer of
the driver (if any :) may not be reachable at the 'support'
addresses above.
