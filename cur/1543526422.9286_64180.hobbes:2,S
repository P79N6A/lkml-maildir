BTW, it would be a quite worthwhile project for somebody with a bit
of spare time at their hands to write such a browser that:
 - is fast
 - knows about types and how to follow function pointers
   (e.g. that can trace foo->send() to the right set of "send"s)
 - allows navigation in views (e.g. "show all callers of xyzzy",
   then walk over the list of callers to pick the right one)
 - has some concept of additional attributes, e.g. "may sleep",
   "grabs a lock", etc.
 - can look inside macros
The navigation should be a bit like with mutt, when you go by arrival
(o u) to check recent stuff, then jump to threads (o t), and finally
end up checking if the author of a particular message has said more
interesting things in the past (o f).
