If you are also loading the sound driver you are likely to get into a mess
with current 2.4 because the sound code sticks its nose into the codec bus
somewhat further nowdays. You driver also seems to be assuming the sound
driver has initialised the codec bus and codecs.
How do you intend the two pieces to interact ?
