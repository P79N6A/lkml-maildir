Thanks for sharing your work! Comments on the coding style aside (it's 
not exactly winning a beauty contest), one thing I spotted while 
skimming over your patch:

This does not seem to be correct. This semaphore has been released 
already and urpl_open is not called under a lock AFAICS.
I'll see if we can fit something like this into the next kernel round 
for our distro. The code needs major cleanup though.
Best regards,
