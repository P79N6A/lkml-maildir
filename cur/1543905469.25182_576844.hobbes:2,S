That test case doesn't do much other than calculating the time taken for each
thread to start running. With this balance on fork patch, that small pthread
test case shows that all the threads now start almost at the same time on all
cores.

My understanding is that linkpack doesn't do fork often(as such
difference might not be visible, but will take a look). We were planning
to test httperf or some other workloads which probably does fork more often.
