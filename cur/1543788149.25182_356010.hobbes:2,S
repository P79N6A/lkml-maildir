Now of you think "outside" the Linux box" you can see where people in 
the real world would expect that if you have no rights to a file to read 
or write to it that you shouldn't be able to delete it. In the outside 
world it's "duh - of course"! but for thouse that are in the "Unix Cult" 
you can't think past inodes.

Once you'be had Netware permissions - even 1990 Netware permission - you
