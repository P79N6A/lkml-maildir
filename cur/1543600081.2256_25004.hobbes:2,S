Timeouts are a completely separate issue, surely? Applications ought to be 
able to deal with getting a _signal_ during a system call, whatever happens.
IMO, sleeping in state TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE in any situation where you can't
prove that the wakeup _will_ happen and will happen _soon_ should be
considered a bug - it's almost always just because someone hasn't bothered
to implement the cleanup code required for dealing with being interrupted.
/me tries to work out why anyone would ever want filesystem accesses to be 
uninterruptible.
