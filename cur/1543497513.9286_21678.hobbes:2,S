Same config  here on  our news servers...  The machines  kept freezing
randomly using 2.2.9 (best uptime: 26h, worst: 15 minutes!)
I went back  to 2.2.6 and just  applied the TCP patches  from davem to
make Typhoon a little bit happier and the servers have been up for 48h
now.
I don't think that the DPT driver is the culpit... Something is broken
in the  SCSI or memory management  because I had the  problems also on
another  machine witch  has an  adaptec 2940  (everything else  is the
same)...
There's a simple way to kill the machine: let the news server (Typhoon
in our case) run and fork a  lot of processes, make some disk activity
then kill/start the server instantly => total freeze (not even sysreq)
