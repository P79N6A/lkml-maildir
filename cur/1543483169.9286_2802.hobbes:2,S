Still applies. I'm doing my tests on 2.2.1 as well.

The page colouring stuff doesn't depend on devfs. Extract the diffs
for the following files:
linux/Documentation/page-colouring.txt
linux/fs/proc/mem.c
linux/include/linux/proc_fs.h
linux/include/linux/sched.h
linux/mm/memory.c

I think that should work. It's easy enough to test.

I'd rather not. It's a pain for me to maintain the different patches
I'm already maintaining. And it's easy enough to take an editor to the
msr patch and just use the page colouring bits.
I now also consider the devfs stuff to be high quality and low
instrusion, so it shouldn't cause problems for those who don't want to
test devfs itself. To be really sure, just pass "devfs=nomount" on
your boot line and it won't even get mounted.
