Read the whole get_empty_filp function, especially this part, note the
goto new_one below and the part you didn't include above [from
the new_one label],
        if (files_stat.nr_files < files_stat.max_files) {
                file_list_unlock();
                f = kmem_cache_alloc(filp_cachep, SLAB_KERNEL);
                file_list_lock();
                if (f) {
                        files_stat.nr_files++;
                        goto new_one;
                }
