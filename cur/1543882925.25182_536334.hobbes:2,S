The following hardware on an Asus P5B Deluxe board worked fine with 2.6.20:

I guess it may come as a side effect of your upcoming patch, but it 
would be nice if sky2 could printk() some basic info when it detects one 
of the controllers that it is going to ignore. Right now it is kind of 
mysterious why eth0 has disappeared in 2.6.21 for some users.
Thanks,
Daniel
