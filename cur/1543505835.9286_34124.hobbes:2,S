Linus, please don't do this.
I think __writel() should expect little endian access as well, we need
both __writel() which doesn't do ordering _and_ writel_be() since it
will otherwise cause problems on big endian machines if you want to
write a portable device driver optimized with wmb()'s in the right
place if __writel() suddenly doesn't to byte swapping.
In fact we will need at least:
writel()      - ordered, little endian
__writel()    - non ordered (and possibly other things) - little endian
writel_be()   - like writel() but big endian
__writel_be() - non ordered - big endian
The only one that could possibly be left out is the ordered
writel_be() but I think we should put it in there as well.
