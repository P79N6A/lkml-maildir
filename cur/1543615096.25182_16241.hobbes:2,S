Heh... well, text mode isn't that nice regarding the need for having
the "ISA memory" window available on the bus, and in general, those legacy
ISA memory and IO space needed by VGA text mode are rather a painful pile of
hack to carry on on non-x86 platforms ;)
And just my 2 cents: X11 is perfectly able to lock up the box solid. It
has root access to /dev/mem, it has direct access to video card registers,
that is enough to lockup the bus in quite a number of cases (shame on
nasty hardware). Add to that DRI with it's kernel module and bus mastering
hardware, and you obtain something with has as much chances as fbdev to
kill your box once it starts behaving erratically.
