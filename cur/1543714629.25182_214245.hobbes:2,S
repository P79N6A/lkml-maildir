It's a huge deal because for *every* I/O, kernel has to do get_user_pages()
to lock the page, it's really gets in the way with the spin_lock as well.
        spin_lock(&mm->page_table_lock);
        do {
                struct page *map;
                int lookup_write = write;
                while (!(map = follow_page(mm, start, lookup_write))) {
With current state of art platform, I/O requirement pushes into 200K
per second, this become quite significant.

That's one, plus the spin lock mentioned above.

I hope the goal here is not to trim code for existing prefaulting scheme.
That function has to go for demand paging, and demand paging comes with
a performance price most people don't realize.  If the goal here is to
make the code prettier, I vote against that.
