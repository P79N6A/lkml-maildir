Allow me to offer humble apologies. I meant no disrespect.
My only desire was to share the results of my experiance with
the topic.

Had you presented a frivolous, obvious, or stupid case no one,
myself included, would have said a word.

Well, we are trying to get something working here, and there is
a bit of baggage to be dealt with.

Nah, the problems are there, and are very real. They are not
insoluable, however.

I'm not the sort to believe things without proof. That these problems
can be resolved has several existance proofs, so I'm satisfied.

I, for one, will miss you if you do. If everyone agreed with me
the securitt world would be in a really sorry state.

Ah, hang around. I'm sure that alot of people learned a whole
lot about policy issues as a result of your arguments.

Certainly there's a component of pragmatic efficiency in having a
smaller number of capabilities, but that is far from the most
important issue. Usability is an important factor. Ever wonder
why people get upset when you say you're going to enhance their
system by taking away the Superuser? Programming securely on a
system with 40 capabilities is stressfull enough, my little brain
boggles at the notion of 330.
My argument is more to the tune that a fine grain of security policy
does not necessarily require a fine grain of capability.

This would seem obvious. What am I missing?

Ah. Well, if your security model sucks, a fine grain implementation
of it is going to really really suck, and the attempt at granularity
is going to make the fact obvious to the most casual observer.
> If you don't have fine grain security, your security model will suck.
This has not been my personal experiance. For the Trusted Irix
evaluation we produced a dandy model whilst retaining the Superuser.
Granularity and suckiness are independent attributes of a security
model.
