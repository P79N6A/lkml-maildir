Running the risk to be deemed an irresponsible featurist I submit the
following:
SHORT:
-----
Let's extend the kernel with a /proc/nzombies feature that tells the
current number of zombies. This is handy for system and network
monitoring purposes. I did some homework and it is a quite trivial
extension to exit.c.

LONG:
----
Many times I've been tasked with defining and implementing remote system
and network monitoring. One of the items we always want to monitor is
the number of zombies currently in the system, because, believe it or
not, the wait*() series of system calls seems to be beyond a lot of
application developers.
To count the number of zombies we usually run the process list (or, in
Linux, the proc directory) and count the processes that are zombies.
Although functional, it is quite a hassle and it is slow. When one of my
students (I teach Linux Programming courses, amongst others) asked how
to solve this I suggested that it should be a quite trivial extension to
the kernel.
Once home I set about it and it proved to be a very small extension to
exit.c. My currently running kernel contains the extension (see below).
The feature adds a "nzombies++" to each exit(), and a "nzombies--" to
each release.
