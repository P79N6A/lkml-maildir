Reading myself again, I realise this may not be very clear, sorry.
The bug happens with all versions of 2.6.* I've tried, including
2.6.10-rc1 + your patches.
I did some more testing with other userspace apps.
- With vgrabbj 0.9.3-1:
$ vgrabbj -d /dev/video0 foo.jpeg
Problem getting window information
Fatal Error (non-daemon), exiting...
There was no map allocated to be freed...
$
(And no complaint from kernel).
- With motion 3.1.14-2:
$ motion
Processing thread 0 - config file motion.conf
Thread0 device: /dev/video0 input: 8
[Nothing happens for a while, then I get bored and ^C]
$
(And exactly one "meye: need to reset HIC!" message).
Roland.
