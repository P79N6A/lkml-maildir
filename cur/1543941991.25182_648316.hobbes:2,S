No, it looks more to me like you aren't properly defining the available
memory somewhere, or along those lines. Are you using CONFIG_HIGHMEM ? I
think there have been some issues until recent patches from Kumar, if
you try to reserve memory in the highmem region (though that may not be
your problem).
Or maybe you are colliding with some of the non-coherent hacks ?

What happens without CONFIG_HIGHMEM ?
