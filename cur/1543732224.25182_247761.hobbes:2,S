I'm still new to this :(
I'll send more fine-grained patches next time, grouped by issue addressed.
The single bit approach was meant to keep the current behavior, because
that is what I thought you wanted:

I read this as: "we could have used the first letter in each symbol for
the type letter from System.map, but we deliberately distorted the
current semantics to be more kernel-relevant."
Since we are on different time zones, we only get to send an email a
day, so asking for confirmation and waiting for the reply would take a
long time... :(
Anyway, I'm assuming now that what we really want is the same type chars
that appear on the System.map file. If compiled with KALLSYMS_ALL, the
/proc/kallsyms file would be an almost exact copy of System.map.
So, moving forward...
A defconfig build produces 13743 symbols with a compressed name stream
of ~130kB. (it is 240kB uncompressed, for the curious)
Adding a letter to each symbol would increase this by about 10%.
We can try 2 different approaches to minimize the impact of this:
  - have the letter inserted before the compression step. This way, the
    table of the best tokens may have "tacpi_" instead of "acpi_" and
    the compression would not suffer as much, except that the symbols
    started with "Tacpi_" would suffer. Only real tests can show how
    this would turn out.
  - build a "sections" table that groups together symbols with the same
    letter. The table would say symbols that have addresses between
    X and Y would have letter Z. This can go horribly wrong if there
    are situations where completely different type letters appear
    intermixed.
I think I'll try the first approach first and see how it goes. I'll
post as soon as I got some numbers.
