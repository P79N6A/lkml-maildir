No reply ... it's a bit urgent as it may bite any system trying to
suspend with a slave IDE disk at least (not including the other possible
problems I've spotted  with this code).
I'm tempted to just send my workaround patch to Linus & Andrew (might
still make it into 2.6.14). That would at least fix the bug with resume
from sleep. What do you think ?
