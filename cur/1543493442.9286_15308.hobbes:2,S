Worked!!!
All I did is to remove the /quota* files and then quotaoff -a
No more problems... so far
I have tryied what normally locks up systematicaly the sync command.
While heavy Disk IO doing a sync and no more problems.
So I really, so far, suspect problems in the quota code in the kernel.
Can somebody verify that and confirm my problem?
Thanks
Andre
