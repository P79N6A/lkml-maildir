The driver needs to be able to clean up in any context.
That's why I'm advocating what willy called an "exception framework".
While I like linus' suggestion is better than the original,
it spreads the driver error recovery code throughout the driver.
That upside is it can handle every situation.
The downside is numerous error paths makes the regular code alot
harder to read and maintain.

The next PIO read will see the error caused by BM-DMA.

yes. IO Error recovery has to deal with every scenario.
