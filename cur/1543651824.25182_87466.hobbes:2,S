Interesting, so it smells like a generic problem. I cannot reproduce it
on my test box (been running kernel compiles and dbenches all afternoon)
with the same kernel. I've got 2.5.46-BK on the desktop again now, we'll
see what happens....
For the record, test box is P3-800MHz SMP, 512MiB RAM. Desktop is a
MP1800+ SMP, 1GiB of RAM.
