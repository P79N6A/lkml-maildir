Hi Renato,
well I have changed the overall HID code design in 2.6.21 a little bit. 
Anyway, just hardcoding '#define DEBUG' and '#define DEBUG_DATA' (that's 
also important) in 2.6.20-and-older kernels should have similar result as 
CONFIG_HID_DEBUG in post-2.6.21.
In your particular case, the DEBUG_DATA might really be more interesting.
Thanks,
