I should have considered the possible resource array overrun
when I created these functions.  I had assumed (apparently
incorrectly) that the old PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES value of 4
was based on a spec defined limit on the maximum number of 
resources that _CRS can return.
I recently noticed the potential overrun myself while backporting
the code to kernel source where PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES was initially
defined as 4.  This happened on a system where the _CRS associated
with one of the root bridges returned 5 resources with the 5th causing
a write beyond the end of the array.  Increasing PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES
to the current value of 8 eliminated the overrun that I experienced 
but after discovering that there is apparently no limit on the
number of resources that _CRS can return I had intended to post
a change similar to what Yinghai Lu is proposing.
With the current PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES value, _CRS can return 
up to 8 resources before the pci_bus resource array is totally
saturated but it should be noted that if a transparent bridge
is present below the root bridge it's child bus will only see
the first 5 resources.
The current fixed pci_bus resource array size of 8 is adequate 
(for storing _CRS returned resource and visibility across
transparent bridges) on those systems that I work on but without
a bound on the number of resources returned by _CRS some sort
of dynamic allocation certainly makes sense.
Note that exposure to this issue is currently limited to those
that use the 'pci=use_crs' kernel option.
