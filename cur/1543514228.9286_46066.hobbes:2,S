Hi Sergey,

That is exactly the point. Alan Cox (and others) kindly explained
recently that doing the stuff you do in your sample code is not portable
because you can't expect sys_call_table[__NR_unlink] to have the same (or
any) meaning on some architectures.
Therefore, it is much cleaner to export the necessary sys_*() functions
and call them just as normal functions.
Regards,
