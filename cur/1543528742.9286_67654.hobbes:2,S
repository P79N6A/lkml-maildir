No. Just that we are discussing semantics of setup that doesn't make any
sense without mount() - it's direct product of the thing. The whole "step
upwards" thing is about semantics of mount().
You would have a point if mount() would not require the existing mountpoint
- then it would be an operation that modifies _link_ behaviour. However,
it operates on object, not on the name. So valid description is "if
result of lookup is a mountpoint you must go upwards", not "if the name of
component is the name mountpoint you should go to the root of mounted tree
instead of doing lookup".
IANAStandardsL, but the whole thing is completely outside of POSIX scope -
it's part of mount() semantics, as all other things regarding moves from
mountpoint to covering and other way round.
