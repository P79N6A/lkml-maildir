for 2, the BIOS sets the hardware to a known state,
or if you can trigger *the* hardware reset line,
which will also do that, then you're going through
the BIOS again.  Now if you made your own bios...
see www.linuxbios.org.
there are patches where a kernel can load another
kernel, also.
As for taking crashdumps on the way up, I believe
(SGI's ?) linux kernel crash dumps does *exactly*
this.
