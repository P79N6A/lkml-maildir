True.  However..

No way to verify this.  I mostly understand the US copyright code as
it impacts my work, but have no idea what the other side of that puddle
does legally (and for that matter, I don't claim to know what the other
side of the other, even bigger, puddle is)...

which says: "I guess the license is meant to be GPL."  And so it was almost
certainly intended to be.

Unfortunately, neither you nor I nor anybody but Kai or Werner (or their
assignees) can do this, as I understand the law.  The only proper resolutions
here are to get one of them to make some sort of statement (I suspect even a
"Yea, it's GPL, we just forgot the macro" e-mail from one of them would be good
enough), or to pull the code out of the 2.6.0 tree till it *is* resolved.
(Sorry to be a stickler, but this is the sort of thing that Darl and
company would love to make a point about - we *do* need to keep careful
track of the actual source and license status of every line....)
Kai? Werner? You out there?
