Note that my usage scenario consists of separate I/O commands:
1. boot
2. tar cf /dev/fd0 somefile
3. tar tvf /dev/fd0
4. suspend (close lid) and later resume (open lid) 
5. tar tvf /dev/fd0 (this one fails since 2.6.18-rc1)
Ages and ages ago the floppy driver would cache data so that
after e.g. one "tar tvf /dev/fd0" command, a new "tar tvf /dev/fd0"
wouldn't actually do any I/O. But nowadays, at least in all 2.6
kernels, that's not done and both "tar tvf /dev/fd0" commands
will read the media.
Thus I don't see any excuse for the kernel failing step 5 above.
