This just calls gettimeofday() indirectly.
It's the system clock, not the RTC.  Afaik, there is no support
for the RTC clock.

ntpd asks the kernel to write the time to the RTC.  I think it
does that from the moment it's sycnhed.  If it would be reading
and writing to the RTC, you could have a problem.

The kernel does write to the RTC if told to do so, every 11
minutes.  This is broken because it doesn't even know what hour
it should be writing, so it doesn't write it.
In arch/i386/kernel/time.c/do_timer_interrupt():
        /*
         * If we have an externally synchronized Linux clock, then update
         * CMOS clock accordingly every ~11 minutes. Set_rtc_mmss() has to be
         * called as close as possible to 500 ms before the new second starts.
         */
        if ((time_status & STA_UNSYNC) == 0 &&
            xtime.tv_sec > last_rtc_update + 660 &&
            xtime.tv_usec >= 500000 - ((unsigned) tick) / 2 &&
            xtime.tv_usec <= 500000 + ((unsigned) tick) / 2) {
                if (set_rtc_mmss(xtime.tv_sec) == 0)
                        last_rtc_update = xtime.tv_sec;
                else
                        last_rtc_update = xtime.tv_sec - 600; /* do it again in
60 s */
        }
