That _is_ dumb.  It should do this (error handling not shown):
	ln library library.sav
	cp new_library library.new
	mv -f library.new library
That way the existence of 'library' is guaranteed.
However, this still won't work if you have to update multiple shared
libraries.  If you have libraries A, B, and C, which all depend on
struct sizes inside each other, and you try to install new A, B, and C
with different struct sizes, then once you've updated A anything linked
against B and C will crash.  If your installation requires access to A,
B, and C, then your installation will crash too.
The answer might be a C program that executes a lot of
	rename("library.new", "library");
given a master list, after all the 'library.new''s have been written.
That C program would do all the renames itself and therefore keeps the
old shared library images in RAM while changing the files around on disk.
The C program would continue until all of the libraries have been replaced,
and once that is done you can happily run the (statically linked)
/sbin/ldconfig -v and you're done.
