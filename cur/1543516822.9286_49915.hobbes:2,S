Indeed, there are other ways to fry a monitor. Coffee anyone?
If someone seriously thinks that this is a problem, actually DO the
request only 60 seconds after the last change, aggregating all
requests upto that point.
Consider only handling the "blanks" that way. That means that
"screen-on" overrides "screen-off".
(-> unblank would mean that the screen is on for at least 60 seconds
after that.)
