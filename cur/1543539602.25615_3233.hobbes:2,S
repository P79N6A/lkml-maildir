	Would you care to actually give *proof* that this can happen under
Linux?  Any program that tries to go outside it's memory space should
segfault before overwriting any other memory.  If the stack is not protected
by this then why isn't that fixed, and why havn't more exploits for it been
written?  I doubt calling a shell as root would be very large, and if what
you say is true then every Linux system out there has a huge security hole
that people are just being kind and not exploiting.  Somehow I doubt this is
the case.

	So you fix the hole that is giving the abuser root.
