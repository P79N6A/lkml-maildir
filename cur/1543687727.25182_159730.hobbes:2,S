Thank you. I never assume no news is good news so I appreciate that.

Yes indeed it is.

Originally flagged HIGH_CREDIT and LOW_CREDIT tasks had no limit on how much 
credit they could accumulate or lose. This worked in practice but I needed 
some cutoff beyond which they would be one or the other and MSA seemed a 
decent number. At some stage if it was boundless there would be variable 
overflow as well and checking for this was unecessary overhead. I dont want 
tasks flagged as high credit to be forgotten though so thats why I dont let 
them change. Originally the same idea was for low credit tasks but that 
proved to occasionally choose X during startup as low credit. Higher numbers? 
perhaps but really this depends on hardware as to what is perfect.
Cheers,
Con
P.S. All this may be moot as it looks like I, or someone else, may have to 
start again.
