Hi all,
A new release of the ocf-linux package is up:
	
http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/
Mostly Openswan updates/cleanups and fixes in this release.
* Well tested on 2.4.32 and 2.6.15 with OpenSwan.
* hold locks for less time which improves
  the cryptosoft (software driver) interaction
  with the system.
* fix cryptodev to handle CRIOGET requests when
  application is chrooted.
* Bug fixes and improvements by Ronen Shitrit
  md5/sha processing in cryptosoft
  other typo/ordering problems in cryptosoft
  more error reporting to make debugging easier.
* updated openswan patch for 2.4.5rc5
* openswan support no longer requires any other crypto
  code (other than OCF) to be configured in.
* openswan code Q's state machine when in interrupt context
  and calls immediately when not (previously compile time
  determined)
* openssh uses OCF appropriately now if it supports required   
  algs
* updated ssl patch to openssl-0.9.8a
* no patch required for openssh anymore
* openssl md5/sha support by Ronen Shitrit
Cheers,
Davidm
