Hi All,
 I am trying to offload checksum calculation to my hardware. What i am doing in my driver (kernel 2.4.6) is :
 dev->features = NETIF_F_IP_CHECKSUM;
 Then, in my start_xmit( ) routine, i am parsing for the right headers & when i get the IP/TCP header, i print out the checksum & it is already the right checksum. When does the OS/Protocol offload this task? Am i missing something here?
thanx for your help
