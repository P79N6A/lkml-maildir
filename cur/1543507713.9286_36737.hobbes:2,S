Erf!  While attempting to compile 2.3.16, it appears some source files in
the 2.3.16 tarball were clobbered with directory data when I was
untarring them.  The only odd thing to note was that I was doing a lot of
simultaneous filesystem-related things at the same time ("rm -rf"ing an
old tree, untarring the new tarball, and downloading some files via FTP
at the same time).
I am running on a Dual Celeron box with IDE drives.  I have attached two
files which I notied were corrupted when the build choked with bad
character messages.  The first file's corruption is obvious: the end
appears to be overwritten with directory data -- it looks like directory
data from the same directory where the file should be
(linux/drivers/char), and the second file is random.c which appears to
have a bunch of directory data overwritten in the middle of the file
(starting on line 1152).
The first thing I did having noticed the corruption was flush as much
memory as I could to see if it was in memory instead of on disk --
rereading the file after showed the same corruption.
I will boot with 2.3.16 now and try doing simultaneous untars and
"rm -rf"s to see if I can reproduce anything.
