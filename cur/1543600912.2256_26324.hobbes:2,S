  -ac kernels contain new quota code so you can use new reiserfs quota
support from 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/reiserfs.
Currently the best patch for you should be for 2.4.0-pre4 (something like
reiserquota-patch-2.4.0-pre4-3.diff.gz) I should make patch for 2.4.9-ac10
soon too. But there's one possible deadlock in the code Chris Mason is working
on (I think he's got to testing now :)) so maybe it'd be better to wait for
a few days for the patch without deadlocks...
