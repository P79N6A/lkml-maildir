I don't see why porting the driver to the V4L2 API has to precede the
software conversion removal I was talking about. I think that the
negotiation of the color formats is not the point here...
For many years no one has ever cancelled deprecated code yet both
users and developers know that software conversion should be made
in userspace. It is worth to state that those who have preached this rule
and have always, for instance, been opposed to optional decoders
in kernel space, have never lifted a finger to correct already existing code. 
Now, I do not expect that these people wake up and even provide a V4L2 driver.
In addition, aside from software conversion, it is enough to take
a quick look at the code to understand that it is no longer maintained.
Having seen the recent occurrences, non-maintained drivers should be
altogether removed.
Nevertheless, there is below a new patch that adds a parameter to the
module and warnings for users, as suggested by you. Within a few months,
if this situation has not changed, I will propose a new patch that
completely removes the driver. At this later date, I hope not to find
objections and excuses that delay this problem.
Rules are made for everyone.
Luca
