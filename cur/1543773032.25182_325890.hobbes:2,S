I partially agree. I think no userland application should have access to the 
un-'fixed' file names; they should be fed only Unicode to prevent the spread 
and acceptance of out of date encodings.
Forcing users to do smart things is often the only way to make them do smart 
things, and the lack of acceptance of Unicode on Linux in the wild seems to 
be the only way.
