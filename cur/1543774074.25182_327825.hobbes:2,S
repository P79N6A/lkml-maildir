well, it was your choice to benchmark ADEOS against PREEMPT_RT, right?  
You posted numbers that showed your project in a favorable light while 
the PREEMPT_RT numbers were more than 100% off. Your second batch of 
numbers showed a tie, but we still dont know the true correct PREEMPT_RT
irq latency values on your hardware, because your testing still had
bugs. So a minimum requirement would be to post accurate numbers - you 
have started this after all.
this thread showcases one of the many reasons why 'vendor sponsored 
benchmarking' is such a bad idea. I wont post benchmark numbers 
comparing PREEMPT_RT to 'other' realtime projects. I'm obviously biased, 
everyone else sees me as biased, so what's the point? Should i pretend 
i'm not biased towards the stuff i wrote? That would be hypocritical 
beyond recognition. I dont benchmark PREEMPT_RT against other projects 
because i know it perfectly well that it is the best thing since sliced 
bread ;)
