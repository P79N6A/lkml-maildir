I didn't say anything agains a particular fs, just that your previous
arguments where utter nonsense.  In fact I think having two or more cluster
filesystems in the tree is a good thing.  Whether the gfs2 code is mergeable
is a completely different question, and it seems at least debatable to
submit a filesystem for inclusion that's still pretty new.
While we're at it I can't find anything describing what gfs2 is about,
what is lacking in gfs, what structual changes did you make, etc..
p.s. why is gfs2 in fs/gfs in the kernel tree?
