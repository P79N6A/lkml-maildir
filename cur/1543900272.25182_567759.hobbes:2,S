I imagine you can't.  I have no idea if there are any intensions to
change the definition of timespec on 32bit architectures, or if the
thought is that they will all be dead before it becomes a problem. :)
I still think the API you define for PPS should support 64bit seconds,
even if on some systems you can't take advantage of it.
