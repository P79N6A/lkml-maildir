That would work.

That's a nice way, as you don't need to register a device.

Ick, I wouldn't recommend having the kernel do this, it's nicer to have
userspace do the firmware send.

I don't think that this would be accepted into the main kernel tree, and
vendors might have a problem with it.

Hey, that's the way I like doing this stuff :)
Almost any of the above would probably work well, and I think all except
#5 and #6 are currently done in the main kernel tree.
Good luck,
