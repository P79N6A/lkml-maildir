Thanks, will apply.

If it's one of these "in a blue moon" things I don't think it matters. 
Whatever is easier. 
In general, patches have lots of advantages: (a) you can apply it 
regardless of version, and (b) pushing the email containing them back and 
forth with commentary etc is very powerful.
So I would generally see git as a "maintainer handling issue", not a 
"these kinds of fixes" issue. Git doesn't obviate the need for having 
people look at patches (and that implies sending them out). But git _is_ a 
good way to push the finished product out, if it's a recurring thing.
