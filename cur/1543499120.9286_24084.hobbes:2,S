   I'm an idiot.  Doing the following did not correct the problem.  I
   wrote it as soon as I 'thought' compilation had passed this point and I
   was very much mistaken.  About 10 minutes later-whamo :(  This is trying
   to compiler with egcs-1.1.2.  Any thoughts?

Just remove the offending line from net/netsyms.c which mentions
rtnl_wlockct because it does not exist anymore in 2.3.x and isn't
needed at all.
