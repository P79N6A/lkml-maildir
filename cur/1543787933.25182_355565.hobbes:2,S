I hate to sound like "one of them" but nothing you've said is revolutionary -
really it's not - but you're saying it as if you just dreamed it up today and
/that's/ what got people annoyed. One of those pseudo-intellectual Starbucks
moments, if you will.

In other words, no. I'm not a processor designer either (very few people
are) but I do have a lot of experience with Xilinx FPGAs and I'll add
something of relevence to the end of this message. The point really is
that some people here know a great deal more than you do about this (and
I'm not saying I'm one of them), they're going to rightfully feel a
little annoyed if you start preeching to the choir.

Would you mind learning to use capitali[sz]ation in your mail? It's
really not very easy to read what you write. Was the above intended to
be an actual sentence (in which case I can't see any clauses in the
above) or just random words which - if said together - will summon some
mystical power upon us?

My point was that some very much more cleaver people have worked on this
for a very long time already. Alan did a lot of cool stuff in the
beginning, what Ingo does now just scares me, etc.

Old hat. It's been worked on for over a decade and some of it is working
out now in the form of concept processors that mix FPGAs with CPUs.

So simple in fact that it's already done in most common hardware. Why
else would we have any offload chips at all?
Please help me to understand the value of your original message. I've
read it a few times, but it continues to allude me.
Jon.
