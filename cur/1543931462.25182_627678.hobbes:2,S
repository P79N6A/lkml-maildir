How is it possible that SIGKILL is blocked?

Could you please explain this change in more details?
Currently ptrace_stop() schedules in TASK_TRACED state even if we have a
pending SIGKILL. With this patch this is still possible, but unless
arch_ptrace_stop_needed() is true and thus we will check sigkill_pending().
Suppose the task was SIGKILL'ed and does ptrace_notify(PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT),
now the resulting action depends on arch_ptrace_stop_needed().
I don't claim this is wrong, just trying to understand.
Thanks,
Oleg.
