Thank you Tigran and Peter for your replies.
In summary:
- Kernel code can't or shouldn't do anything too high-level.
  Emulating high-level things through calls to other parts
  of the kernel is not likely to be portable across versions.
- A subset of libc functions is in the linux/lib directory.
  Libc functions that mess with system things can't be used.
  Utility functions can be used if the libc code is copied in.
- Kernel code should get a user process to do the things it
  can't do.  The kernel and user procss can communicate using
  either /proc, /dev, or system calls (netlink sockets look
  like the go here).
