Hi Greg,
here's a rediff of some driver core patches I send before against your
current tree (patches in driver/ applied). Patches 1-3 had been sitting
in -mm for a while, patches 4-7 have already been sent on Oct 17.
[1/7] driver core fixes: make_class_name() retval checks
[2/7] driver core fixes: sysfs_create_link() retval checks in core.c
[3/7] driver core fixes: device_register() retval check in platform.c
[4/7] driver core: Don't stop probing on ->probe errors.
[5/7] driver core: Change function call order in device_bind_driver().
[6/7] driver core: Per-subsystem multithreaded probing.
[7/7] driver core: Don't fail attaching the device if it cannot be bound.
