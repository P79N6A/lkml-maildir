Hi everyone,
I can confirm that the nic is set to auto-sensing/auto-negotiation.
There is no way for me to change the behaviour of the switch, it's
always auto-negotiation. Also, I cannot say to what state a port on the
switch is set at one time - if it is half- or full-duplex etc.
But it would seem that I have some sort of hardware problem, my guess
would be the motherboard. Some problems with my cd/dvd drive occurred,
besides this the I installed win xp on the same machine as dual boot to
check it out and the network behaviour is exactly the same. Sorry, it
seems to be false alarm.
Cheers,
Todor

Please confirm that the switch and nic are both set to auto-neg, or both
the
switch and the nic forced to the same settings (i.e. 100/half).  We need
to
make sure both ends of the wire match.
