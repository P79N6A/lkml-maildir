(2a) For every module that needs persistent data and is configured in,
compile a 2nd module which will only keep those specific variables.
no need to compile them into the static kernel...
usually you won't unload module foo_data but only foo,
but if you decide that you won't need foo _and_ it's persistent data
any longer you still have the options to unload foo_data too and thus
free up (reinitialize after reloading) the persistent data space...
