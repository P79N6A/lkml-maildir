The non-leader case for TIOCNOTTY in the base kernel is different
because it is wrong and I've fixed that one.
If you can factor disassociate_ctty out to do what you need I'd prefer
that path so the tty locking actually ends up in the tty layer.

Looks sane and the lock ordering matches vhangup() which may actually
also do what you want - I'm not 100% sure I follow what SELinux tries to
do here.
