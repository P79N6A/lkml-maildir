| Actually, don't even do the vm_file thing at all, just do something lile

Is support for older kernels (pre 2.2.0) needed at all anymore?
I do not know if the 3dfx module made it to the kernel yet,
but I am willing to strip off the code for the older kernels
and test it for the lastest 2.2.x kernel (I am still running
2.1.131 ;).
The last version I wrote is Dev3Dfx-2.5.tar.gz
(see 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/3dfx/index.html
)
Did someone already add improvements to that version?
If so, then I am not aware if it.
