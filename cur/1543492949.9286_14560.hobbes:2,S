Why is this? Wouldnt they be using exactly the same filtering mechanism
as one which was filtering only routed packets? There may be much more
work to do I guess, as every packet on either side of the bridge
has to be inspected in order to make a bridging decision, then on top
of that comes the firewalling decision.
Sorry if this is naive - I'm a relative newcomer to anything beyond
a LAN.
