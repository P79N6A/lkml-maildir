Can't you just skip that one (-ENOSPC)? It would oops on 32way NUMAQ. Why 
don't we just fix this properly now, it looks like we might end up just 
piling workarounds ontop of kludges. The intel guys were kind enough to 
crank out a vector based irq handling patch and it's just what we need to 
purge NR_IRQS misuse.

This just makes the relationship between NR_IRQS and NR_IRQ_VECTORS even 
more confusing. If you have one IDT, NR_IRQ_VECTORS is ~190
