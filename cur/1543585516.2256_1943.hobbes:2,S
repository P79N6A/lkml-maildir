IMHO, much of the strength of Linux is the very large, extremely 
diverse population of folks using it, testing it, beating on 
the latest release, etc.  
However, a lab dedicated to testing the linux kernel, properly 
funded, staffed, and containing the most common hardware and 
software would be a good idea.  Does anyone have any idea how
this could be accomplished?  Who could do it?  IBM?  What would
it cost to setup a reasonable lab?  My guess would be dozens 
of machines of various architectures, a staff of at least 10,
several thousand square feet of space, and a good budget....
Any takers?  
Much of the kernel COULD be tested such as file systems, network 
stack, SMP, compile options on various platforms, etc.  More
obscure hardware, some older hardware, etc., would be out of 
scope for such an effort.
Cheers,
