Great. Congratulations (having written the original comment).
I would encode the morse strings as bits in a integer instead of strings
though (perhaps with some macros to make it readable), that should shrink 
it quite a bit.

I would consider beeps annoying, but then I usually just cut the beeper
line on any new PC I install so personally I do not care. Still imagine
what a machine room that overheated and caused several boxes to panic
would sound like...
