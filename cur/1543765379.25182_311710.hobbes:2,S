Subject: [PATCH][TRIVIAL][DOCUMENTATION] - Version clarification - support status of 3com OfficeConnect card
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Version 2 of the 3com OfficeConnect 11g Cardbus Card aka 3CRWE154G72 is
not supported by the prism54 project. To stop confusion, the kernel
documentation should state so as 3com made a good job hiding the version
difference.
