I am following up my own post because I found some more info.
I was using an rsize and wsize of 16384 when mounting that nfs (which is
on a raid0 md device) any value less than 16384 seems to work ok. Also,
other nfs mount between the same hosts seem to be ok with 16384, it still
just the raid0 nfs mount that is the problem with rsize and wsize of
16384.
