Then you get the annotation sorted out so cleanup() get discarded in the
built-in case. But you leave no room for automated tools to detect this.
If this is really necessary (and I daught) then a specific section should be
dedicated for this usage.
We have lot of issues with current __init/__exit, __devinit/__devexit, __cpuint/__cpuexit
and introducing more of the kind does not help it.
So even if it saves a few bytes in some odd cases the added complaxity is IMHO not worth it.
