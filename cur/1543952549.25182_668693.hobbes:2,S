Comparing with 2.6.25-rc5, volanoMark has 12% regression with 2.6.25-rc6
on my 8-core stoakley.

    sched: fix fair sleepers
    Fair sleepers need to scale their latency target down by runqueue
    weight. Otherwise busy systems will gain ever larger sleep bonus.

In the patch, vruntime -= calc_delta_fair(sysctl_sched_latency, &cfs_rq->load).
Should we call __sched_period to get the first parameter of calc_delta_fair in case
there are more than 5 tasks in the runqueue?
