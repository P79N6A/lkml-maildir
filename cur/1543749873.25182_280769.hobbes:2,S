Well I will keep an eye out for when 2.6.10 is released then and upgrade
to that.  As long as it is a known and fixed problem I can live with
that.  It hasn't been and issue for me more than once a month or so when
I go on major cleanup hunts.
I was starting to think I had to convert to ext3 which would be quite a
hassle.
