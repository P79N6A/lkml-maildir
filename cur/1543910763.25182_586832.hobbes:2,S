Not in my experience.  We use NetApps as our backing NFS servers, so
maybe my experience isn't totally relevant.  But with a mix of Linux
and Solaris clients, we've never had problems with soft,intr on our
NFS clients.
We also don't see file corruption, mysterious executables failing to
run, etc.  
Now maybe those issues are raised when you have a Linux NFS server
with Solaris clients.  But in my book, reliable NFS servers are key,
and if they are reliable, 'soft,intr' works just fine.
Now maybe if we had NFS exported directories everywhere, and stuff
cross mounted all over the place with autofs, then we might change our
minds.  
In any case, I don't dis-agree with the fundamental request to make
the NFS client code on Linux easier to work with.  I bet Trond (who
works at NetApp) will have something to say on this issue.
