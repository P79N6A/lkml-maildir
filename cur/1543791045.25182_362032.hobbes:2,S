They may not be feature-equivalent in reality, but it's hard to generate 
something that has the features (or lack there-of) of old kernels these 
days. Which is problematic.
But some of it is likely also compilers. gcc does insane padding in many 
cases these days. 
And a lot of it is us just being bloated. Argh.
