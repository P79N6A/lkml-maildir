I don't think Linus said that at all. In fact, the first trees that
Linus made and distributed were done this way and have become the
de-facto standard as a result of this.

No. I have /usr/include/subdirectories which contain headers for X11, some
that contain headers for Motif, some that contain headers for pthreads,
bind-4.9.3, etc. These are not glibc headers.
You cannot decide that I can't keep these where they are.
Any portable code is not supposed to include non-portable headers.
This means that if your code does:
#include <linux/something.h>
it is not portable. If your portable code is written properly, the
presence of links to non-portable headers in /usr/include does nothing.
They are never referenced.
When you need to have current kernel headers referenced, your non-
portable code (like modules) specifically includes the linux headers.
This is now it's been done. I see no reason to change it.

We don't use /usr/src/linux/include. As stated, the include files
are referenced from /usr/include.
