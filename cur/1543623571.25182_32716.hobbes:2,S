Hi, can anybody from the linux kernel developers tell me what is wrong with 
proxy arp in kernel 2.4. I just want to configure my machine so as to act as 
an arp proxy. When I do arp -s <ipaddr> <hwaddr> pub the kernel adds the 
following line to my arp cache:
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask     Iface
ipaddr 		     * 	      *                   	MP                  eth0
and when I am trying to ping the newly configured node I receive destination 
unrichable message.
On the other hand I have the following programme which is supposed to do the 
same task, however it adds exactly the same entry in the arp cache, and I 
have also the same result as before when I try to ping the new node
int
main(argc, argv)
        int                     	argc;
        char                    	**argv;
{
        int            	    	tunfd;
        IP_addr    	   	ip_addr;
        struct ifreq            	ifreq;
        struct arpreq    	arp;
        struct ether_addr       	ea;
        struct sockaddr_in      *paddr;
        if( argc != 2){
                printf("Usage: tunnel <IP ADDRESS>\n");
                exit(1);
        }
        if( (inet_pton(AF_INET, *(argv + 1), &ip_addr)) < 0)
                err_sys("inet_pton error");
        if( (tunfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)) < 0)
                err_sys("socket error");
        strcpy(ifreq.ifr_name, "eth0");
        if( ioctl(tunfd, SIOCGIFHWADDR, &ifreq))
                err_sys("ioctl error");
        memcpy(&ea, ifreq.ifr_hwaddr.sa_data, ETH_ALEN);
        memset(&arp, 0x00, sizeof(arp));
        paddr = (struct sockaddr_in*) &arp.arp_pa;
        bzero(paddr, sizeof(Sockaddr_in));
        paddr->sin_family = AF_INET;
        memcpy(&paddr->sin_addr, &ip_addr, sizeof(IP_addr));
        arp.arp_ha.sa_family = ARPHRD_ETHER;
        /*I tryied also AF_UNSPEC*/
        memcpy(arp.arp_ha.sa_data, ea.ether_addr_octet, ETH_ALEN);
        arp.arp_flags |= ATF_PUBL;
        strcpy(arp.arp_dev, "eth0");
        if( ioctl(tunfd, SIOCSARP,  &arp))
                err_sys("ioctl error");
        if(close(tunfd))
                err_sys("close error");
        return 0;
}
All I want to know is if there is a problem with ioctl SIOCSARP. Is there any 
other way to add entries to my arp cache? I heard about netlink sockets but 
except the manual page I found nothing else.

PS1. The net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp flag is set.
PS2. I subscribed to the kernel mailing list a few hours ago but still 
haven't received any mail, so please if somebody answers include me in the cc:
