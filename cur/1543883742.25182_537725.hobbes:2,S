Why isn't this stuff going upstream rapidly?
AFAICT nothing much at all has happened upstream besides a mass renaming?
The whole point of having ext4 in the kernel is to do development 
upstream, in the public view, getting new stuff in ASAP (even if that 
means changing or pulling some stuff later).
As it stands now, ext4 in the upstream tree is completely useless -- 
it's the same as ext3, and has been for months (since Oct 11).
Hello?  Upstream development?  Ever heard of it?
