Because of the .sleepers thing.  Perhaps a revamped semaphore wouldn't need

Why is the mutex-using kernel any smaller?  IOW: from where do these
savings come?

Why is the mutex-using kernel more scalable?
Can semaphores be tuned to offer the same scalability improvements?

Cannot the semaphore code be improved in the same manner?

IOW: a complete PITA, sorry.

Pretty much all of that could be added to semaphores-when-used-as-mutexes. 
Without introducing a whole new locking mechanism.

Ditto, I expect.

Actually that's the only compelling reason I've yet seen, sorry.
What is it about these mutexes which is useful to RT and why cannot that
feature be provided by semaphores?
Ingo, there appear to be quite a few straw-man arguments here.  You're
comparing a subsystem (semaphores) which obviously could do with a lot of
fixing and enhancing with something new which has had a lot of recent
feature work out into it.
I'd prefer to see mutexes compared with semaphores after you've put as much
work into improving semaphores as you have into developing mutexes.
