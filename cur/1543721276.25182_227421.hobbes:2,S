Hi Andrew,
we just tracked down a severe bug in the memory management
code of s390. There is a race window where s390 can loose
a dirty bit. I never expected that SetPageUptodate is called
on an already up to date page...
blue skies,
  Martin.

[PATCH] s390: lost dirty bits.
The SetPageUptodate function is called for pages that are already
up to date. The arch_set_page_uptodate function of s390 may not
clear the dirty bit in that case otherwise a dirty bit which is set
between the start of an i/o for a writeback and a following call
to SetPageUptodate is lost.
