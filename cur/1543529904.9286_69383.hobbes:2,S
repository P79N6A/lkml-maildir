In the simplest case (while(1){malloc(4096);}) then typically the
malicious code will be the first one blown away, at least on most
multi-user boxen (where there a lots of users, each using a few Mb, then
some DOSer grabs the last 50Mb in one process.
On a big system with few users (running huge simulations, say) then the
one big process might get blown away first. On the other hand, the
malicious users shouldn't have logins on those boxen anyway :-)
OK, a more intelligent malicious user could write code that would find the
biggest process currently running, then allocate slightly less memory than
it, then fork and repeat. Fixing this would need per-user resource
limits...
