Hmm, interesting question. It looks like the count field in struct
hvc_struct is being used to count opens and closes which should
reference count the IRQ usage too.
Oh, I see, hvc_hangup resets count but the Xen dom0 hv_ops was missing
the hangup hook to release the IRQ -- I'll fix this.
I think this patch can be ignored, real bug is on the Xen side.
Ian.
