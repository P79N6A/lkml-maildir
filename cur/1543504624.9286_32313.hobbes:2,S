According to another message in this thread, gas 2.9.5 (presumeably from
binutils-2.9.5) or later is required for 16-bit asm code generation to
be stable.
So we have
as86 - works, but poor docs and poor interface (raw binary code?? :))
nasm - portable, maintained, has docs, but an additional dependency
gas - requires bleeding edge version, strange 16-bit syntax
IMHO nasm seems the best choice.  Its 16-bit support will be familiar to
many, and also has been stable for longer than gas's 16-bit support has
existed.
I don't have a big problem with the additional dependency -- it is
merely a burden on _developers_, not end users.  I hope that anyone
compiling a kernel can handle installing nasm.
