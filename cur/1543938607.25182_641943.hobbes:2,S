The following patch series fixes some bugs in how Linux determines
whether PCIe Advance Error Reporting (AER) is supported on a platform.  It
is currently broken on at least HP IA-64 systems.
 - PCI: Run ACPI _OSC method on root bridges only
 - ACPI: Check for any matching CID when walking namespace.
 - PCI ACPI: AER driver should only register PCIe devices with _OSC.
 - PCI ACPI: Added a function to register _OSC with only PCIe devices.
These patches apply to gregkh's patch tree:
