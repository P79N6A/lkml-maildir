I've tried your patches - but can see no significant reduction in 
overhead. I've updated my table with numbers from your patches:

'+Jeremy' is a CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y run done with your patches.
The most stable count is the instruction count:
 | 1957153827 | 2161280486 | 2161741689  instructions             +10.43%
But your two patches did not reduce the instruction count in any 
measurable way.
In any case, it is rather inefficient of me proxy-testing your patches, 
you can do these measurements yourself too on any Core2 or later Intel 
CPU, by running tip/master plus picking up these two utilities:
    
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/perfcounters/perfstat.c
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/mmap-perf.c
building them and running this (as root):
    taskset 1 ./perfstat ./mmap-perf 1
it will give you numbers like the ones above.
