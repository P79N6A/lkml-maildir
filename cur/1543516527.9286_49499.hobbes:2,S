HI!
 The concerned hardware/software is:
 U.S. Robotics Flash 56k
 linux kernel version 2.3.26
 pppd 2.3.10
 problem:
 Right after power on the first access to the modem fails:
 The telefone line is accessed (one can hear the "line-free"
 sign (hopefully this my english is correct enough to be
 halfaway understandable...;o)) but there is no dailing.
 For a long time I thought, it is a bug --hrrmmm, sorry--
 FEATURE of the modem.
 BUT:
 If I disconnect the modem from power, power on the computer
 and dial my ISP (which fails, cause there is no reponsible modem),
 kill pppd by hand, switch on the modem seperatley and THEN 
 call my ISP again, it works by the first access to the modem
 (in view of the modem...).
 Cause the modem cannot accept any command if switched off,
 it cannot be influenced by the call while switched off.
 What is going on there -- or do I confuse something?
 Any help very appreciated! :-)
 Thank a lot in advance!
 KEEP HACKING !
