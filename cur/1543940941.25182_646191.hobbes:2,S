Ah, that is Lennarts Pulse Audio thing, he has samples in memory which
might not have been used for a while, and he wants to be able to
pre-fetch those when he suspects they might need to be played. So that
once the audio thread comes along and stuffs them down /dev/dsp its all
nice in memory.
Since its all soft real-time at best he feels its better to do a best
effort at not hitting swap than it is to strain the system with mlock
usage.
