ALL instructions are performed by the microcode. If the microcode
that is loaded into the control-store upon reset is replaced by
microcode that is loaded later, why should it be slower? It is
possible that some control-sequence may be replaced with one that
takes fewer clocks, takes more clocks, or takes the same number of
clocks. If it takes the same number of clocks, there is no change.
If fewer, faster. If greater, slower. FYI, the WCS (Writable control-
store) goes back to Digital PDP-days (and VAXen). The CPU was a
board, not a chip. It was damn dumb upon power-up. A monitor program
in an 8085, loaded the microcode from a tape called the "console".
The WCS allows CPUs to be fixed permanently, if something is wrong,
with absolutely no negative trade-offs whatsoever.

It is theoretically possible for me to win the Lottery tomorrow.
Since I haven't yet purchased a chance, it is unlikely.........
But chaos theory shows the probability is non-zero, even if I
don't purchase the chance. So, "theoretically" is one of those
words that can't be used to substantiate an argument.
