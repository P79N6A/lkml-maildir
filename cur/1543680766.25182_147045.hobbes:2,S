That is NOT an error condition - the API specifically allows NULL to be 
passed in, and specifically states that no action will be taken in that 
case.
But consider the following code:
sscanf(0,0);
That IS an error condition - both the string to scan and the format 
string are NULL. In this case sscanf should return EITHER 0 (no items 
matched) or better still -1 (error).
As others have said - ideally, if you have any doubt about a new 
function you are writing being able to succeed, you should write it to 
return a success report.
However, my whole point was that simply checking for null and doing 
nothing when null was not a valid value was violating the rule of "don't 
check if you don't know how to handle".
