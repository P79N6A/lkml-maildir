I need to put Ben's "Add arch specific dev_archdata to struct device"
patch into my tree in the for-2.6.20 branch, because it creates
include/asm-powerpc/device.h, and I have other patches queued up which
touch include/asm-powerpc/device.h.
Greg, if you want you can drop that patch, and Linus' tree will get it
via my tree, or if that's difficult, Linus' tree will get it from both
directions.  I'm sure git will sort it out. :)
Paul.
