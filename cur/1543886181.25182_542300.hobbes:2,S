Hi, Andi:
The attached patch (actually, git show output) makes my Dell 1501 to hang
on boot. Sorry, I have no clue why... The culprit is found with git bisect.
But yes, it's an AMD MK-36. I use an x86_64 kernel. It is 100% reproducible.
Cheers,
-- Pete

    [PATCH] x86: Use RDTSCP for synchronous get_cycles if possible
    RDTSCP is already synchronous and doesn't need an explicit CPUID.
    This is a little faster and more importantly avoids VMEXITs on Hypervisors.
    Original patch from Joerg Roedel, but reworked by AK
    Also includes miscompilation fix by Eric Biederman
