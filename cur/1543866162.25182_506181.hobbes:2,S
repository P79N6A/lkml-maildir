I didn't know i did, conversely removed some trailing ones (in
comments) and some multiline assigments. And i've tried to not touch
rules-sections.
As my first ever patch was open/close top Makefile with
emacs, resulting tabify+trailing-whitespace-delete fail on Andrew's
`make'.
Finally i didn't know it will be commited, my will was -mm for
testing. I'm very sorry, Linus, to bother you with reverting.
