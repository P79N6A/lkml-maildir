Subject: i386 and x86-64 bitops function prototypes differ

Hello,
I ran into compiler warnings with the perfmon code when I tried
using test() and __set_bit() on i386. 
For some reason, the i386 bitops functions use unsigned long * for
the address whereas x86-64/ia64 use void *.
I do not quite understand why such difference?
Is this just for historical reasons?
Thanks.
