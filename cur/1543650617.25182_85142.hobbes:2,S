Got this on booting 2.5.45.  Not seen on subsequent reboot.
I was too lazy to copy everything down, plus not everything
was on screen.
EIP is at free_block+0x4e/0xe4
Call trace:
reap_timer_fnc
run_timer_tasklet
reap_timer_fnc
tasklet_hi_action
do_softirq
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
system_call
Arf!  Killed in interrupt handler etc.
