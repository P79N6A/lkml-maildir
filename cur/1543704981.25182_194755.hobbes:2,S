Agreed.  But would those not eventually run out?  Certainly, there will 
always be a supply of used cards that are 2-generations behind, but 
eventually, we may get to the point where all the used cards have no 
public documentation.
But perhaps at that point, Linux will dominate and the manufacturers 
will feel pressured to open their register sets.
