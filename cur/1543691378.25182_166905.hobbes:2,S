Hello all.
We at Half-Life Dedicated Server Linux list are in a warm debat about 
changes in 2.4.9 CPU/VM/Scheduling code versus the actual 2.4.22 ones.
Some guys are reporting a huge cpu decrease usage in the "old" 2.4.9 
kernel version, about 40% lesser.
Others are talking about "broken top/ps" tools, but we aren't using 
these tools, but the "stats" command inside our gaming console.
In a quick find, we've not seen any "significant" change, nor nothing to 
really explain this change.
Please, can someone "revive" this "changelog" and answer us if this is 
really happening? Was really a real change in these params/code?!
Also, some specs also include extra packages and changes: the -ac9 
patch, ext3-2.4-0.9.9-249ac9 patch and param.h HZ base freq changes 
(200, 500, 700, 1000...).
Please CC me, as i'm not subscribed to list.

 (must 
subscribe before, sorry), September 2003, in thread "[hlds_linux] HOW TO 
GET SUPER LOW CPU USE!! THANK DLINKOZ"
Sorry about my poor english. Thanks in advance.
