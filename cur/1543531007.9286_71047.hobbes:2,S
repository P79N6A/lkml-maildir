No! Or perhaps it depends on what you want this user-space daemon to do.
Once you reach the OOM condition, this program can not reliably run. And I
doubt that a user-space daemon could prevent OOM from happening on a time
sharing system, since a malicious (or buggy) program could try to use all
memory during a single timeslice.
When OOM the kernel has to kill something. The trick is for the kernel to
kill tasks that are considered "less important". Don't kill init, X
server, syslogd, whatever. Some of this policy could be set by a userspace
daemon.
This is completely independent of overcommit or rlimits (which can cause
the OOM behavior to happen more often, though in more predictable and
perhaps less drastic fashion).
I'm a scientific app programmer, not a system programmer... but I'll try
to code up a simple daemon in the next couple days that works in
conjunction with a modified version of Rik van Riel's patch.
