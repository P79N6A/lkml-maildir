except for section 2 which states that if parts are related (or at least
not independent, for example when they are designed to exclusively work
togethern), and one part is GPL, then both parts need to be, or you
should not distribute the GPL part. This is not "your other code becomes
gpl", it is "you can't distribute the GPL parts".
