OK, new list at the end of this email.

Sure.

OK.  Our glibc patches are against 2.3.3.  I realise it's not the most 
recent, but it's the best we've got for now.

I can't help but feel we've got our wires crossed here.
If, for example, neither C library has code to use openat in the absence 
of __NR_open, then surely it is premature to remove __NR_open from any 
arch, microblaze included?

This is all very reasonable, but it's not clear why broad changes in 
glibc would be part of MicroBlaze's critical path into kernel.org. 
There are already N arch's in the kernel using mixture of obsolete and 
new API's, I don't see the problem with MicroBlaze making it N+1.

I'm not interested in a glibc vs uClibc debate. For deeply embedded 
systems that MicroBlaze targets, uClibc's smaller footprint makes a lot 
of sense.
The installed base of uClibc vs glibc for MicroBlaze is probably 10000:1 
or more in uClibc's favour due to our history being entirely !MMU until 
2008.  I don't expect that to change much once we get the MMU and ld.so 
functionality into our uClibc port.

OK, new list below (note glibc 2.3.3) - it's still pretty long but 32 
fewer than the last iteration.
FYI here's the search expression ($syscall is the __NR_ macro)
egrep -R \
