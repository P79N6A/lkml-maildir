If you have the page locked (which you can't from where you're trying,
but we'll tackle that next), and the page is swapcache, then doesn't
that pin you a reference to the swap entry as well? So I still don't
see why you need that extra reference.... I know there is a
try_to_unuse_page/entry hiding in try_to_unuse somewhere ;)

That's just how the pagecache works in general. You might be right
that there isn't anything wrong in this case, but hopefully we can
avoid it.

The writeback bit isn't a lock, and yes the page lock is needed when
dealing with swapcache.
That isn't your only problem though, and we simply don't want to do
this (potentially expensive) unusing from interrupt context. Noting
the error and dealing with it in process context I think is the best
way to do it.
BTW. what's the driver you're using? It might be useful to have an
option to schedule a timer for the completions (at least the ones
which generate errors).

I can't for the life of me see how or why this is happening. I don't
doubt it is a problem, but it smells like another bug.

I don't think we have to worry about any of the filesystem code, even
if we are talking about a swap file. It should all go straight through
page_io.c. And wait_on_page_writeback doesn't have its return value
checked in any of the swap code AFAIK...
Still, something must be triggering it somewhere.

PageError means that the page could not be written / read from disk.
This is true in the pagecache / filesystem code too, and it is
PageUptodate that tells whether the page itself is valid or not.

swap_writepage sounds better than . You've even got the page
already locked for you, so the job's half done ;)
What performance implications did you imagine? The fastpath will
just be a single PageError test, and error case slowpath doesn't
matter too much beyond having something that actually works.
