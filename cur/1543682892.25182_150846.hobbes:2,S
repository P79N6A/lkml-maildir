Subject: [PATCH 2.6.0-test1-mm2] fix unable to mount root fs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The problem is being caused by the dev_t changes that now print out
dev_t's as major:minor instead of a hex value.  See print_dev_t().
This patch changes try_name() in init/do_mounts.c to get the major
and minor and return a MKDEV(major, minor).  I've tested this on
my machines and it boots with root=/dev/hda2.
