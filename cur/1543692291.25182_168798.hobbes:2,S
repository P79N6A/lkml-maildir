   I cannot back-up my data since my comp by itself is backup :-)

   Because your workload doesn't hit the 1GB limit.
   Actually we just do not have fast enough I/O + CPU to utilize 1GB of 
RAM efficiently.
   But if you will go into 128MB of RAM - you will see difference, where 
should be no difference.
   Let's say (my personal exp.) cp'ing of kernel source with 0.5/0.25 GB 
RAM dosn't differ. Aproximately the same time. 0.25GB little bit faster 
- but it can be written off to noise. But try to do the same cp with 
0.125GB - this cp (as of RH 2.4.20-20.9 +ext3 -swap) takes _*two*_ times 
longer. Should it be?
