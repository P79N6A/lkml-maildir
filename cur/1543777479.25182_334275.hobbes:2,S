hello all,
i wish to write a module for i386 that can hook interrupts. the module
loads its own interrupt descriptor table instead of the default
system's table. after executing my own handler(s), the old appropriate
handler will be called.
i could not find any documentation or sample code explaining how this
is done in 2.6. There are very few outdated examples on the web which
apparently are not suitable.
can anyone help me out?
yours,
zvi
