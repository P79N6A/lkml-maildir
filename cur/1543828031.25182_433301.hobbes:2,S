Having the IWCM copy the pdata during the upcall also leaves
the greatest flexibility for the driver on how/where the pdata
is captured. The IWCM has to deal with user-mode, indefinite
delays waiting for a response and user-mode processes that die
while holding a connection request. So it makes sense for that
layer to do the allocating and copying.
