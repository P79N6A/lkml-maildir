I've been storing all my important data (including music ;-) ) on
reiser4 since a few months... Others may disagree, but for me and my
data it is definitely safer than
reiser3-before-ordered-data-mode-was-integrated.
With time and use, I'm starting to really trust it : absolutely no
data-loss or corruption experienced in spite of a few power-outage and
other unrelated (bad kernels) crashes (*)...

(*) as seen by the very few reiser4 bugs reported on the reiserfs
mailing-list these days, I'd say that there are either almost no
reiser4 users left, or that users are indeed encountering very few
problems with it...
