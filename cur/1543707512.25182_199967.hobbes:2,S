Good grief... I'm not surprised the drive's dying, then! I've seen drives
lock up around 35C, I'm quite impressed the drive is still chugging along
(to some extent, at least) at 48C - and a max of 65C? Looking at a few of
Fujitsu's pages (eg,
http://www.fujitsu.ca/products/mobile_hdd/mht_ah/physical_specs.html
),
ambient operating temperature is 5C to 55C - perhaps that's the cause of
the drive dying?
Just out of curiosity, Nico, what're you doing with these drives that
they're running so hot?
Cheers, Steve
