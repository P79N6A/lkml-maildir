Since you asked, but I am warning you that you don't want to know....
Well, maybe you do - there is a project to port UNIXy tools to every
platform in existance. While I like some of the people involved just
a whole lot I dislike the way they have done it. They attempt to pervert
other filesystems into UNIX lookalikes. They needed links. They
pestered the Commodore people until in desperation to shut them
up Randall made an effort. As you note, as a filesystem AFFS is not
well suited to links. (But then a lightweight threaded OS is not well
suited to several popular GCCisms such as huge amounts of data
on the stack. It takes programmer discipline to write threaded programs
properly. But the results are, in my experience, very well worth it. And
avoiding stack overflow on small stack spaces is one of the keys
unless the OS has done what BeOS did by assigning absurd default
stack spaces to accommodate GeekGadgets.)

SFS is a private effort on Hendrix's part. It is wholely unrelated to FFS.
But it does work on the Amiga, fairly nicely. I'm not sure how much of
his structures he has released publicly. (It is also in perpetual beta.)

Private email is easier. I've had my Use(less)Net aversion therapy. (I
got well and good spoiled by BIX in its prime. It had the highest signal
to noise ratio I have experienced yet.)
Er, and if you want info about the latest changes to the RDB spec to
incorporate into the kernel attempts to read the AFFS boot sectors
<singsong voice> "I can help you." Er, I am the person guilty for the
latest perversions. {^_-}

Um, it would not be either polite or politic to say what I "really" think
here or
anywhere else. I am reserving judgement until I have had a chance to test
what a full up "elate" can do. I am willing to be (very) surprised.
The interesting thing is that we need an OS somewhere between QNX and
Linux. Sadly it appears that NT is about what fits in the niche and is well
enough
known to sell to our customers, theme parks, theaters, cruise ships, and
other
venues. It's a small niche. We have fun doing it. And we make enough money
to finance doing more of it. (And so far the customers are more than passing
honest, which is amazingly refreshing. And it's amazing fun to walk into a
place
like Wonderland in the Toronto area and see their volcano really work
knowing
that it is our tool making it go. The looks on the other people's faces are
VERY
rewarding.)
(Er, by day Loren, my partner,  is a mild mannered (hah) OS hacker for
UniSys. Lately he's been "doing" specialty HALs for their BIG machines.
He has some interesting opinions about the various OSs out there and
how people are relearning what he and his buddies learned, often the
hard way, 20 years ago. He nearly single handedly built some of the
Burroughs OSs. Chuckle - he was hired to write documentation. They
discovered he was fixing bugs he found while testing his documentation.
Suddenly he was tossed into the OS group as a programmer.)
