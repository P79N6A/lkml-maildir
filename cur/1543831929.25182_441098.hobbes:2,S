Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Fix FRV, ELF-FDPIC and NOMMU stuff [try #3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/6/106

The attached patches:
 (1) Fix compilation errors and other problems in the FRV arch and the
     ELF-FDPIC binfmt driver.
 (2) Fix a problem with the NOMMU ramfs filesystem when executing binaries
     stored therein.
 (3) Fix up the ELF-FDPIC coding style and implement a minor change to reduce
     the number of times ksize() is called.
 (4) Add ELF-FDPIC coredump support.
 (5) Make the FRV arch make use of the asm-offsets stuff.
In [try #2] the following change has been made:
 (*) Inclusions of <linux/config.h> added by the patches have been dropped as
     they're not necessary.
In [try #3]:
 (*) ELF-FDPIC Coding style fixups.
 (*) Minor ELF-FDPIC change to reduce the number of times ksize() is called.
