Passing PIO mode 9 to sii680 will make it do udma133 with
unmask off, same as "-X70 -u0". What sii did was to make a
bug a feature by embedding their own special pio mode for the
well-known cmdxxx unmask off requirement.
Making A Bug A Feature is begging for "deprecation".
Since -p9 was only documented to set u133 and unmask off,
making a bug a feature, non-bug features are not user-expected
to be set without using other(normal) hdparm options, so
somebody might as well "man hdparm" and bypass the silly
kludge which probably was an internal office joke anyway.
