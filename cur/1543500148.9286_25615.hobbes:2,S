2.3.7:
time make dep
21.950u 3.120s 0:26.90 93.1% 0+0k 0+0io 41875pf+0w
2.3.5:
time make dep
22.240u 2.800s 0:25.90 96.6% 0+0k 0+0io 42128pf+0w
So we see an increase of 11% in system time, when going from 2.3.5 to
2.3.7. But according to what DaveM said, this is a case which should
definately have benefited.
