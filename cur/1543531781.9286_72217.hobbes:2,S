The hidden assumption of the pre-emption patch  is that there are kernel 
paths that take more than 500us to reach a schedule or return to user 
mode. Obviously there are such paths, but what are they and why can't they
be fixed?  If they were fixed, this whole discussion would stop and 
we would have a very responsive kernel that did not sacrifice 
throughput for latency.
There should be a kernel debug test that crashes the kernel when more than
500us have passed between entering kernel mode and leaving either the 
process or kernel mode.
