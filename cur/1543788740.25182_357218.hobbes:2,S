1) You want something changed, you propse a (tested) patch which
   actually changes the code you want. And then be prepared that
2) (at least) the maintaniners of concerned
   drivers/architectures/subsystems may have some seriuos problems with
   the direction your patch points to (let alone coding style).
3) Then you update/improve your patch.
4) Goto 1 until the patch is accepted or you withdraw it.
