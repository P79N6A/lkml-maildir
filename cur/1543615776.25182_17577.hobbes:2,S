Note that uClinux (not ucLinux as on your page) does not natively
run the ELF binary file format, but uses what is called the
"Flat" binary format.  It is structurally much simpler (and
therefore smaller) then ELF, but more importantly, this format
helps us avoid needing to always use PIC and/or do tons of
relocations.
We use an ELF toolchain to create binaries, except the toolchain
is modified such that ld is actually a script which first runs
the real 'ld' to produce an ELF file and then also runs
'elf2flt' to create the flat executable.  
The uClinux toolchains for ARM and m68k (which are the two most
commonly used architectures) are available from 
    
http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/m68k-elf-tools/
Links to toolchains for other arches and _lots_ of help
information can be found at
