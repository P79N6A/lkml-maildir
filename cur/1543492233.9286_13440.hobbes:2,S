I was also 'inconvenienced', along with a lot of other people, when
microsoft.com blacklisted the .ac.uk 'domain' and thus denied access
to their site from every university in the UK. The problem with that
is that the .ac.uk 'domain' is NOT a single domain, but a super-domain
like .net or .org with many separate subdomains that are administered
separately...
Personally, I stand by my claim that blocking whole domains in that
manner is what the spammers WANT you to do, since they get their kicks
by causing people to inconvenience other people in this way. Because
of this, I also stand by my claim that blocking domains willy-nilly
like that only harms the people doing the blocking, and lets the
spammers jump for joy at another success.

I could also help by just refusing to do business with any company
that has me blocked, but that's because they deny me the opportunity
to do business with them, not because I choose to do so.
Don't get me wrong, there ARE companies that have a SENSIBLE blocking
policy relating to whole domains - one such is Compaq - but there are
far too many that are willing to surrender to the spammers...
Best wishes from Riley.
