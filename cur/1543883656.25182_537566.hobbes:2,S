I've just installed a vanilla CentOS 4.4 on an i686 SMP machine - with 
an nVidia Quadro4 980 XGL card.
By default, this sets up X using the 'nv' driver (using RedHat's 
xorg-x11-6.8.2-1.EL.13.37).
If I follow my 'recipe' above, then the screen shifts - note: it looks 
like you have to write several lines of text to /dev/console (at least 
30) to trigger the problem (e.g. run the echo to /dev/console in a loop) 
- also, I've found that switching to the console and back to X 
(Ctrl-Alt-F1 then Ctrl-Alt-F7) while this echo loop is running can force 
the shift to start ...
This is with the RedHat based 2.6.9-42.ELsmp kernel - but I also get the 
problem with a vanilla 2.6.21 kernel.

I'm not sure what the current console is - whatever is the default with 
RHEL4/CentOS4 - how do I select a different type of console?

It doesn't happen if there is no previous 'setterm -blank 0' - so, 
arguably, this is the 'fix' ...
