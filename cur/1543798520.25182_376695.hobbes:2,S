I think because of kinds of cases and other issues, going with
MSI by default is a non-starter.
Perhaps a better approach is to use a flag in the pci_driver_struct or
similar that says "you can have MSI enabled by default".  And
gradually convert drivers over which we know will handle it properly.
Doing some tom foolery with request_irq() sounds like a half-baked
idea at best.  The biggest argument against that is that this is
not a PCI interface, so expecting it to have PCI side effects is
really asking for trouble.
