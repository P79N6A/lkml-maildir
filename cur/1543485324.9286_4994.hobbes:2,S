    =2E. which is a bug.

    I still don't see, why the ramdisk is filled with zero. Data could be
    preserved.
    If mkfs.msdos would set the blocksize with an ioctl, the problems would not
    exist, that's true.=20
    I feel still very uncomfortable thinking that a mount system call can
    destroy data.
Since you cc util-linux:
1) This is a bad kernel bug - silently destroying data is never a good idea.
2) You can avoid the problem by doing something like
	mount -t msdos /dev/ram2 /mnt -o blocksize=1024
