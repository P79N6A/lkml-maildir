Are you sure?  At the moment, the latest changeset is 1.1027, made at
12:49:07 -08:00 today.  That's just under four hours ago.
In any case, it would be better not to have to poll a website to get
updates, but have them actively delivered by smtp, which brings us
back to what I first suggested:
Why can't we have a mailing list that sends out a diff for each
update?
That way, all you need is:
