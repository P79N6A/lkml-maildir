Taking the blame.

I used it for linewrapping in the oops output.
Actually I would expect more users from sprintf and snprintf
(e.g. common in /proc output to compute the return value of the read) 
and that is exactly the same code path.
If you do the same grep for sn?printf I bet there will be much more hits.
