Yeah, call it the socket transmit queue model :).  Maybe tuned by a  
ulimit?
I don't have very strong opinions abou the specific mechanics of  
limiting concurrent submissions, as long as they're there.  Some  
folks in Oracle complain about having one more thing to have to tune,  
but the alternative seems worse.

EAGAIN or the initial number of submissions completed before the one  
that ran over the limit, perhaps.  Sure.  Nothing too controversial  
here :).   I have this kind of stuff queued up for worrying about  
once the internal mechanics are stronger.
