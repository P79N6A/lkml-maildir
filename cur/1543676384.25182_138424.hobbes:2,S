Where is your dev tree located? I've checked your website on 
people.sistina.com and the various Sistina CVS trees, but I can't really find 
anything (regarding suspend and resume target methods) that's very recent. Do 
you have another ftp server somewhere?

Right.
So are you saying it would be alright to remove a suspended device that has no 
pending I/O or isn't open? If so, the current code (in 2.5.70) doesn't seem 
to coordinate the removal of such a device with another process trying to 
open it or submit new I/O. Some new locking of the device would be necessary 
to prevent a device which is being removed from being opened at the same 
time.
Sorry if it sounds like I'm harping on this issue - I don't mean to. :)  Just 
interested in the details behind some of the proposed changes and some of the 
affects the changes might have. It will probably be much easier to just wait 
to see your new code, which will definitively answer these questions.

Ok, this seems reasonable.
