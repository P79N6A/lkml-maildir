I was wondering if there was some way to make a Kconfig menu either  
be just a menu or a choice depending on another bool being set or not.
What I'm trying to accomplish is if CONFIG_ONLY_HAVE_ONE is set I  
want it so you can only select on option, however if  
CONFIG_ONLY_HAVE_ONE is not set you should be able to select multiple  
options.
thanks
