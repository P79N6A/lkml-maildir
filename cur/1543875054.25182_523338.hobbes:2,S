agreed - this seems to be a genuine CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y bug. (which 
has probably not been fixed since -rc4 either, we have no bugfix in this 
area that could explain the expires_next==KTIME_MAX timer state visible 
in SysRq-Q.)
there seems to be a trend in the reports: HT P4 CPUs.

yes - i was quite wrong pushing it so hard. (and doubly so given your 
stated focus of making v2.6.20 a quiet release) Sorry :-/

yeah - we are working hard on it.
