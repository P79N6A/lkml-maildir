That is what is confusing me.. From the sar man page:
pgpgin/s
     Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per second.
pgpgout/s
     Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second.

Yeah, it wouldn't help if paging isn't the problem. I'd like more 
clarificaton on sar before I throw out paging being the culprit.
