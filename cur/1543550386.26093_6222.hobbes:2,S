WHAT? Are you nuts - they pay breed for many of the core kernel
developers - I think if they didn't those would actually
have entierly stopped working on Linux otherwise just after finishing
scool and going into the real world out there. You can't hardly call
this behaviour *demanging*!!! And then there is Alan himself!

here and they do it in a *very* open way indeed. This is what the GPL is
explicitly permitting them to do.
