These additions to drivers might help with the kernel virtualization.

I thought Rudolf's patch allocated the resource in the driver
(w83627ehf) and ACPI contacted the driver when it could not allocate
the resource. Since ACPI never *really* wants to allocate the
resource, is there a fast-path check it could do? This would help
performance.

All of ACPI uses the same "virtualized" access mechanism, so even if
two threads are poking at the bank select register in a race condition
(that would be awful code, I think) they would see the same virtual
behavior.

I like the virtualized driver method (if it wasn't obvious!) but the
global AML lock works also. It will be interesting to see profiling of
both solutions.
