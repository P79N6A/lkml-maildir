Remember that I have TWO PCI buses and one ISA Bus.

Yes. I had to patch 2.4.0pre2 to be able to boot, but now it boots
unpatched. 
Why do you mean by "annoying" ? I thought this was just an
initialization problem.
By the way, my BIOS has an option to choose between MP 1.4 or older 
specifications. Changing it has not changed anything to the problem.

Okay. Thank you very much.

I will check that with Asus. At this time I have BIOS 1002.
