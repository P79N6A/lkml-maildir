Nothing "forbids" me, it's just the artifical distinstion of the two is,
in my opinion, stupid and foolish.  You are trying to define use-cases
to justify their notion that you must give up the hardware keys for one
type of device, yet not for another.
Even the people that feel that v2 says you need to give up the keys
think this is dumb.  But we've been through all of that before (see
previous long thread about v3 and why the kernel developers hate it, it
all still applys to the final draft.)
