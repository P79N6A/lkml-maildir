Split it into read and write options, for a start. This is important in
a sub-"root"-user environment as is currently created with my MultiAdm
LSM, which, due to the broad spectrum CAP_SYS_ADMIN addresses, must
give SYS_ADMIN to the subadmin (to be able to read restricted objects)
and restrict it afterwards in all the LSM hooks (to not write to
restricted objects).
