Just to be clear; this wasn't a personal attack.  I know a lot of
people who I greatly respect who were MacOS and Scheme programmers (I
went to school at MIT, after all, the birthplace of Scheme).  The
reality though is that most people don't program that way, and their
brains aren't wired in that fashion.  There is a reason why procedural
languages are far more common than purely functional models, and why
aside from (pre-version 10) MacOS, most OS's don't use an event driven
system call interface.

So far, I'd have to say the people arguing for an event driven model
are in the distinct minority...
And as far as voting is concerned, I prefer informed voters who can
explain why, in their own words, why they are in favor of a particular
alternative.
