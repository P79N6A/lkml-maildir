Largely I think you have the right of it, that the optimization is
correct.  My biggest complaint is that the common case is going to be
several references to the data structure.  Releasing the references
will always be slow.  To do the read you need to get the value into
the cache line.
So it looks to me like you are optimizing the wrong case and
bloating the icache with unnecessary code.
