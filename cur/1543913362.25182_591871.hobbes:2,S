just for the record; I have absolutely no problem with allowing the new
cf8 method (I'm assuming that it's obvious that if mmio is available,
that will be used instead for performance reasons). What I was/am
concerned/uncomfortable about is keying this off the CPU level rather
than a PCI level property; I much rather would see this keyed of, say,
the PCI ID of the root bridge, or ideally from some PCI property.
