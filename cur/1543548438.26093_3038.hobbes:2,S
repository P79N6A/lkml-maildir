An in-filesystem revision number would do the trick.  Could be REALLY
efficient.  All you have to do is stat and you know if the thing really
changed, instead of just knowing a date that can be horked.  I like!  I
like a lot!
Something else that'd be nice would be to make Linux deal better with NFS
dates.  The date presented by an NFS server for files is its timestamp. 
If the linux NFS client code were to subsequently check the stamp after
performing an operation, it could use that to approximate the time error
and this problem would about 99% disappear, with a fudge factor of under a
second.  Comments?
Later,
David
