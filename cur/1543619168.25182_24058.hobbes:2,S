Perhaps it'd be easier for patches-2.4 to actually send a copy to whoever 
is the relevant maintainer of a "section" (which could be worked out from 
the path in the patch, as long as it's made relevant to linux/) as well as 
the 2.4 maintainer? There is a lot of things that can be done here.

Perhaps that is a good use for my lkml-patches idea, which gives those who 
have no avenue a place to post patches so they get picked up.
Something that does need to be done is that various directories under the 
kernel tree need to have someone "who receives patches" for that part, and 
who forwards them onto the kernel maintainer (eg: Linus, Marcello, etc) for 
further review/inclusion/rejection. This way, anything that doesn't fall 
under a particular maintainer gets sectioned off to someone, so it does get 
review, and hopefully a reply.
