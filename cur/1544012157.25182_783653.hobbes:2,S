Should be L2 cache hot, which is almost always the case if FILEIO is 
used, because data are just copied from the page cache. Although, 
frankly, at the moment I can't find from where I got that number..

No, because you can't say which one is the last. E.g., a page can be 
mmaped to another process, while it's being transmitted. So, the only 
possible way is to track all gets and puts done by networking using some 
external reference counting (net_ref_cnt in case if iscsi-scst).
