Yes, the lifer of a kernel debugger is hard... 
Pavel, one question (maybe stupid, I am not at all an expert). Wouldn't be
possible to add a printk when invoking and returning from suspend/resume
methods of drivers, telling if they are specific or generic on? Maybe with
the help of the serial console could be an aid to detect wich drivers are
failing in that case. It could have helped the ALPS case, methinks.
Obviously, under a "kernel hacking" config. I'd love to be able to make it
myself, but I do not know where to start...
