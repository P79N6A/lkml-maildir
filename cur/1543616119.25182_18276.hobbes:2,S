Subject: [PATCH] Add support for a newer eepro100 chipset for 2.5

Greetings,
This is a "nicer" patch that adds this chipset entry to pci_ids.h as well as 
adding the check in eepro100.c. This chipset is used in (at least) newer 
Compaq laptops, and woks very well. This chipset is already supported in the 
2.4 series, the patch I sent earlier was a diff of the 2.4 driver and the 2.5 
driver.   I am not able to nicely add support for the remaining chipsets, as 
I don't know thier names other then thier pci id's, so this patch does not 
add support for the 7 other chipsets supported in 2.4 but not in 2.5.
I think the earlier patch is more helpful, but at this point I would like to 
at least see my laptop supported by the stock kernel.
Josh
