Do you plan to merge the netfilter kernel modules into the kernel? I only
want to know if I have to automate the netfilter recompilation and
installation in the kernel-build-install process (recompiling and
installing the netfilter modules by hand after each kernel replacement
it's getting too slowww ;).
