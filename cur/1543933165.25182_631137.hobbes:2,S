That would be really bad.
/proc/slabinfo intimately exposes implementation-specific internals and
strictly speaking should never have been introduced.  Obviously that isn't
a _practical_ position, but there are no easy solutions here.
We don't want to have to drag a pile of be-compatible-with-slab gunk along
with us for ever.

slabtop needs to be changed asap.
Possibly we could look at adding some interrim make-it-look-like-slab hack
into slub.c for a couple of releases but no longer.
If we'd updated slabtop six months ago this issue wouldn't have arisen now.
But we didn't do that.   We're quite bad at this sort of thing.
