Looking good. I imagine it must be good for icache.
Man, the page allocator somehow turned unreadable since I last
looked at it! We will want this patch.

I don't think #2 is any good. The reason we don't check GFP_HIGH on
the first time round is because we simply want to kick kswapd at its
normal watermark - ie. it doesn't matter what kind of allocation this
is, kswapd should start at the same time no matter what.
If you don't do this, then a GFP_HIGH allocator can allocate right
down to its limit before it kicks kswapd, then it either will fail or
will have to do direct reclaim.
I would be inclined to simply add a int gfp_high argument to
get_page_from_freelist, which would also somewhat match zone_watermark_ok.

How about moving the zone_statistics up into the 'if (page)'
test of get_page_from_freelist? This way we don't have to
evaluate page_zone().
