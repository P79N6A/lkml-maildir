This issue has hit a lot of Ubuntu Dell uses (like myself), and the
patch indeed fixes it up - but it appears not all Dell machines are
alike.  One user has reported it doesn't work, and his investigation
reveals dmicode output shows:
Vendor: Dell Computer Corporation
So I guess this isn't totally fixed yet.  As to what the vendor output
is al all these machines, I don't know, but I guess now it could be any
permatation of Dell Inc., Dell Computer Corp. etc.
