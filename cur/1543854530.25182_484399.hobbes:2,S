I agree with all these objections.
The real issue here is the way ieee1394 sets up children of devices with
no driver.  On the face of it that is quite illogical: If a device has no
driver, then who can interrogate it to find out about its children?
USB faces a similar situation.  In a USB device, all the real work is 
actually done by "interfaces".  So we set up a device structure for the 
USB device itself, plus device structures for each of its interfaces.  The 
parent structure is bound to a (more or less) dummy driver, which insures 
that the child structures are deleted whenever it gets unbound.
Still, maybe some compromise can be reached.  Perhaps Dmitry's idea, or 
something like it, can be adopted.
