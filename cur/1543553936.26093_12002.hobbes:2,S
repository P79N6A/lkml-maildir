I like!  No kernel code, yet no races or delay.
As written that removes the possibilities of variable length persistant
data, and the data is opaque to user space.
MODULE_PARM provides type information and structure to the data.  Why
not mark certain PARMS as persistent?  Not all would be named -- a block
of opaque data is useful.  But certain things like all the mixer levels
could be named parameters, giving you both persistant storage _and_
explicit configuration when you want that.  "s" PARMS (or similar)
can hold variable length data.
