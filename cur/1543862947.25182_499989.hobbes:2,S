Hmmm... the problem is that it is expensive to calculate these numbers on 
larger systems. In order to calculate active and inactive pages we 
have to first go through all the zones of the system. In a NUMA system 
there could be many zones.

An expensive function. And we need to call it whenever we calculate dirty 
limits.
Maybe could create ZVC counters that allow an inexpensive determination of 
these numbers? Then we first need to make sure that the counters are not 
assumed to be accurate at all times.
