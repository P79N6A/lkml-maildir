It was found quite quickly though.  Fedora rawhide tracks Linus'
-git trees on an almost daily basis, and this change blew up
the installer, so it wasn't hard to reproduce :)
ddcprobe isn't something that a lot of people run on a daily basis
(probably just the installer people, and they never see -mm kernels),
but I'm surprised that vbetool didn't get spotted when it was in -mm,
as more and more people seem to be trying out suspend/resume these days.
Maybe suspend was busted for some other reason at the time it
was in -mm, so people never got that far ?
