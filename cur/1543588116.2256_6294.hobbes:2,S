Al, you write:

I had always assumed that it would be a power-of-two size, but since it
is an undocumented option to mke2fs, I suppose it was never really
intended to be used.  It appears, however, that the mke2fs code
doesn't do ANY checking on the parameter, so you could concievably make
the inode size SMALLER than the current size, and this would DEFINITELY
be bad as well.

However, we _should_ be safe against this, because ext2_read_super() does:
        if (le32_to_cpu(es->s_rev_level) == EXT2_GOOD_OLD_REV) {
                sb->u.ext2_sb.s_inode_size = EXT2_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE;
                sb->u.ext2_sb.s_first_ino = EXT2_GOOD_OLD_FIRST_INO;
        } else {
                sb->u.ext2_sb.s_inode_size = le16_to_cpu(es->s_inode_size);
                sb->u.ext2_sb.s_first_ino = le32_to_cpu(es->s_first_ino);
                if (sb->u.ext2_sb.s_inode_size != EXT2_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE) {
                        printk ("EXT2-fs: unsupported inode size: %d\n",
                                sb->u.ext2_sb.s_inode_size);
                        goto failed_mount;
                }
        }
Are you talking about user-space code or kernel code when you say it is
segfaulting and corrupting memory?

This would be my preferred solution, makes the math in the kernel a lot
faster.  Should probably be put into mke2fs for safety, and also checked
when/if we ever allow the kernel to mount a filesystem with non-power-of-2
inode sizes.

mke2fs will always set up the filesystem this way, and there is no real
reason NOT to do that.  If you are using a filesystem block for the inode
table, it is pointless to leave part of it empty, because you can't use
it for anything else anyways.
