Is the device port powered (i.e. no other power input)?
My guess is that you are try to get power from the port hand shake
line.  If these lines aren't set appropriately, then you are effectively
drawing power off the transmit line (when it tries to go high).  Check
what the level of each line is under Linux and whatever is currently
working.
You can control these lines under Linux (or almost any Unix) using the
ioctl command.  I can't find the code that I usually use for this, so I
can't give more detail right now.  I know that there are open source
packages that let you play with them.
