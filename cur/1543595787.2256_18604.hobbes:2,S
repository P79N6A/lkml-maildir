A little test report follows...
Just tested RedHat's 2.4.3-12 and 2.4.5-ac19 on A7V133 mobo. RedHat's kernel
seems to work without lockups, but 2.4.5-ac19 doesn't (locks up at boot,
compiled w/o athlon optimization and ACPI), so no changes on that.
2.4.3-12 also correctly detects cable connected to VIA controller as 40-w
while 2.4.5-ac19 still detects it as 80-w.
2.4.3-12 although seems to have the reiserfs unmount lock race, so I can't
use it... :(
