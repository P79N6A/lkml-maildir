Hi Davide,
I just realized that 'edge triggered I/O readiness notification facility'
is too jargony.  A plain English wording of the man page title might be
epoll \- I/O readiness change notification facility
This is shorter and much clearer.  Apologies for having suggested
the earlier jargony text.
