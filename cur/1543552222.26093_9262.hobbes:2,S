Subject: Anything in Linux similar to FreeBSD accept filter

The release notes for Apache 1.3.14 mention that it has support for FreeBSD's accept filters [which are in FreeBSD 4.0 onwards]. Reading the man page. I find that this allows the application to request the kernel to pre-process incoming connections and it was pioneered by engineers at Yahoo.com. 
According to this URL at the Apache site,
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/perf-bsd44.html#accf
shows how accept filters improve performance
Is there anything similar in Linux 2.4 (possibly back-ported to 2.2)
Regards /ymg
