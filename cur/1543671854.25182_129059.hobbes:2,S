Except that the testl is unnecessary.  The full semantics of
bsrl are:
if (source != 0) {
	destination = <index of most significant set bit in source>;
	ZF = 0;
} else {
	destination = UNDEFINED;
	ZF = 1;
}
Thus, there are two reasonable code sequences:
asm("	bsrl	%2, %1"
"\n	cmovne  %1, %0" : "=r" (bit), "=r" (temp) : "rm" (x), "0" (32));
and (if I've got the earlyclobber syntax right):
asm("	bsrl	%1, %0"
"\n	cmoveq  %2, %0" : "=&r,&r" (bit) : "0,rm" (x), "rm,rm" (32));
Note that in this latter case, I have to list %1 == %0 as an explicit
alternative, because otherwise the & on operand 0 would tell GCC to forbid
that combination and it's only %0 == %2 that's forbidden.
(The first alternative is listed first because it uses fewer registers
and so is preferred, all other things being equal.)
Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to let GCC choose between these two
alternatives...
