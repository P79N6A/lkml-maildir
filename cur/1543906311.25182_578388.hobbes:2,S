You should apply -rcN or -gitX patches on the previous Linus' kernel
(2.6.x) and not the 2.6.x.y "-stable" ones -- those are a "parallel" tree.

Hmm, you've got mtdpart build separately as well. Could you redo as per
what I suggested above (take 2.6.22, apply -rc1, then -rc1-git3) and then
rebuild after "make oldconfig" ... and let us know if you still end up
with these modules? Could also be a make/toolchain issue at your end,
for all I know.
