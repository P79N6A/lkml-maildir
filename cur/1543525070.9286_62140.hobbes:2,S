bcica:~ # ps lw 7577
 FLAGS   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   SIZE   RSS WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND

This is the second time in two days, that a process gets stuck in
rpc_execute. It is the same program, run as non-root, trying to do an
ordinary F_SETLKW fcntl() for a read lock.
It succeeds thousands of the times, but this time it has locked up the
process. I know it is in the locking operation because /proc tells me
only the lockfile is open.
I don't understand why the process is locked up, but I do not think
that it is normal :(. Isn't there a timeout for whatever it is trying
to do? 
I would be happy to collect some more information, if somebody told me
how to turn on debugging for the RPC layer, etc...
Thanks,
Miklos
