I like it.  This really shouldn't require anything new except 
a script to call /sbin/kexec.  
As long as memory hotplug is a rare event that should work
fine.  And with real hotplug it will be a rare event.  It looks
like something similar may also be needed for cpu hotplug, but
a compile time maximum on cpu may save us there.
The Xen guys idea of memory hotplug is another matter it sounds
like the want to page an OS with memory hotplug which is just
plain silly, and also unimplemented so I will cross that bridge
when I come to it.
