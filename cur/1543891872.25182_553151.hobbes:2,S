Nicholas McGuire told me that the non common cases should be put in
else branches of if statements for i386. At the time, I did a quick test
that correlated what he said, but I seem to be unable to reproduce this
behavior now (maybe my code snippet is too simple?): I will then assume
that the likely/unlikely (builtin expects) tells everything that is
needed to gcc until further notice. Therefore, we can use the form :
if (cond_call(var)), as you proposed.

Agreed.
