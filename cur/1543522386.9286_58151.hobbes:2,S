Hello all,
      Just wanted to send you all this little OOPS that I found when I
returned home this weekend.  I got home and found my winbox locked solid, and
the CPU meter on the linux box spiked extremely high.  After doing a through
search of my system, no thing looked abnormal.  Then I saw that the daily CRON
job of slocate was still active.  I tried to unmount the share mounted to my
linux box via samba that still thought it was connected to my winbox.  Of
course it wasn't.  But anything I tired to do to the dir /mnt/* would lock
that console up, and spike the CPU meter even higher.  I checked the syslog
and I found this little guy all snug away.  Anyway, I'm running kernel 2.2.14,
samba-2.0.4 19990517 (I know it's old, but it works,) glibc-2.1.1-6,
egcs-1.1.2-12.  You there are any other questions about this, please feel free
to email me, because I'm not joined to the list!
