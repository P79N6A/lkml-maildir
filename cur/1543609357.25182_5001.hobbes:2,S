Hi all,
I'm trying to compile kernel 2.4.14.
The problem is that the famous gcc 3.0.x bug of giving error when
trying to compile 8139too.c is getting me crazy.
The work around is to remove -O2 optimization.
How can I compile the kernel with optimization except
optimization for that particular file?
I've tried to compile it as usual. Then I got an error in
8139too.c  and I manually compile the file into an object file
without optimization and I though make would see the file
compiled and it'd not try again but I was wrong. As soon as I
tried to compile the kernel with make bzImage it started to pass
all files already compiled but when it entered drivers/net the
first thing it did was to compile the 8139too.c file with
optimization and I'm stuck.
How can I remove optimization from that file only or maybe
compile the file manually and then don't let make compile the
file again?
Best regards,
Paulo
