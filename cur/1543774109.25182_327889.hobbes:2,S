Great, it works now!  I had actually stumbled across a similar recipe
on my own, but prior to your very recent update of libata-dev.git
it gave me a huge unruly diff that didn't look right.
Now, though, the recipe above gives me exactly the same patch
that you posted, thanks!
Now if only the same were possible for atapi-enable,
though I suspect that branch is simply a one-liner to libata.h.
Do you have the suspend/resume stuff (Jens A.) in a tree some place?
Thanks Jeff!
