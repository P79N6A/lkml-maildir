Hello Dear,
There is a very great news that has just hit the stands, It is that now there are people on the net that can help you get the password of any email address of major websites like Yahoo, Rediff, MSN, Indiatimes etc..
All you have to do is Pay them $ 50 and tell the email address of that person. You will have to pay the money only and only when you have got the password.
They will first prove it that they have got the password then only you have to pay them.
One of the person I know is Mr. Jack White. His email address is mishra80@hotpop.com
All you need to do is send him the name and email address of the person you want to have the password. Rest leave it on him.
Thanks Buddy for reading.
Your Friend,
Ritu
