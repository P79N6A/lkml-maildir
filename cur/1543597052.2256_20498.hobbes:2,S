	Andreas, could you take a look at ext2 patchkit? It's on
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2 and I'm going to start feeding that
stuff as soon as 2.5 opens. Patches there (the largest being ~7Kb,
most much smaller) are what I've cut into reasonable pieces; since
there's already 27 chunks in the set the rest is not too high on
my immediate list...
	BTW, folks, since minixfs patch got no complaints during the
last week... Alan, Linus - do you want it in your trees? It switches
the thing to page cache (pretty similar to sysvfs rewrite) and cleans
the things up a bit.
