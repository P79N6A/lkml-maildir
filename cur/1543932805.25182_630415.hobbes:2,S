Of course, but what's the relevance?

But what reference?
struct page_cgroup *page_get_page_cgroup(struct page *page)
{
	return (struct page_cgroup *)
		(page->page_cgroup & ~PAGE_CGROUP_LOCK);
}
I guess the issue is that often a "get" function has a complementary
"put" function, but this isn't one of them.  Would page_page_cgroup
be a better name, perhaps?  I don't know.
