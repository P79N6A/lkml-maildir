Paul,
The fork_connector is not designed to solve accounting data collection
problem.
The accounting data collection must be done via a hook from do_exit().
The acct_process() hook invokes do_acct_process() to write BSD
accounting data to disk. CSA needs a similar hook off do_exit() to
collect more accounting data and write to disk in different
accounting records format. This part is not part of fork_connector.
ELSA does not care how accounting data being written to disks. However,
it needs the accounting data being reliably and accurately collected
and written to disk by BSD and/or CSA and it needs the <ppid, pid>
information to aggregate processes. It was never the fork_connector's
intention to piggy back the data to the accounting file.
Thanks,
  - jay
