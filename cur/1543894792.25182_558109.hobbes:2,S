Hi!

Or just create the files with restrictive labels by default. That way
you "fail closed".

...and no, race there is not important. Attacker may have opened the
file under old name and is keeping open file descriptor. So this does
not add a new race relative to AA.

And now, if you move a tree, there will be old labels for a while. But
this does not matter, because attacker could be keeping file
descriptors.
Only case where attacker _can't_ be keeping file descriptors is newly
created files in recently moved tree. But as you already create files
with restrictive permissions, that's okay.
Yes, you may get some -EPERM during the tree move, but AA has that
problem already, see that "when madly moving trees we sometimes
construct path file never ever had".
