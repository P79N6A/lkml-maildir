 Fortunately that's not true.  Grab the relevant docs from: 
'
ftp://download.intel.com/support/chipsets/430nx/
'.  The semantics of
0xcf8, 0xcf9, 0xcfa and 0xcfb I/O ports when used as byte quantities is
explained there.  Note that 0xcf8 and 0xcfa are the way to get at the PCI
config space using conf2 accesses.
