I'd like to put my small plug in that this make me a little nervous.
It could also be a problem with the firmware (aka BIOS) missetting
something up.  Working with linuxBIOS I have seen burst-writes
(enabled with write-combining or write-back) cause data corruption
when non-burst-writes to memory don't cause problems, when the memory
controller is setup wrong.  (This is was with intel 440GX & 440BX
chipsets).
