Thanks very much.  Obviously someone else needed to scratch this itch 
too.  This should produce the correct results when running on the 
target machine.  Here, it produces this:
[root@coyote CIO-DIO96]# sh ../gcccpuopt
 -march=athlon-xp -mfpmath=sse -msse -mmmx -m3dnow
-- 
Cheers & thanks again, Gene
