Hello,
I have heard that this particular information, while very important to
userland developers like me, is probably too expensive to keep track of
for most users.
Perhaps a way to enable it for developers, whom are willing to spend the
cpu cycles, and disable it for regular use would be a solution.
Would it be possible develop a solution allowing us to enable/disable
this tracking via a sysctl call?
