I may have missed one of his posts where he gave the results from the
RT test suite. I found a list of functions with some kind of numbers,
though I didn't see a description of what those numbers were and was
looking for something more detailed (e.g. the output of the RT
instrumentation things he had with and without preempt). This is all
mostly curiosity and sort of hoping this gets carried out vaguely
scientifically anyway, so I'm not really arguing one way or the other.
