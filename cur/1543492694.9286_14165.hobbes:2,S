Actually, I prefer to avoid colourful expressions (that doesn't mean I
*never* use them, of course), because it is more emotive. Better to
avoid emotional content when having a technical debate, IMO.

I think the suid-root magic marker scheme has all that flexibility.

If you have the caps when you log in, why do you need to write a
binary which gives you those caps? It can't be for the benefit of
everybody else, since you're taking away rwx access for others.
The solution to giving certain *users* caps is to write a PAM.

I said that because I do think it's broken and it opens up security
holes. Because of the security holes, I don't think you solution
should be considered. That's not a personal statement, it's a
reflection on the idea.

I've given them already:
- NFS/CODA export of cap-enabled binaries
- non-root access to /usr with < 2.3 kernels.
Basically, anywhere the sticky bit can leak in is a show
stopper. Also, anywhere you can modify a file with the sticky bit is
also a problem.

Probably. I want a good, workable solution that doesn't strip away
NFS/CODA and also works with tar, cp, cpio and all the rest.

No! I already made this point last week. You only need suid-root to
*grant* caps. Any binary can have its CAP ELF section with a mask of
caps that are *removed*. There is no privilege needed for that.
So, if you feel you must run portmap as UID=0 but are worried portmap
could be hacked, then add ~CAP_PORT to the deny mask.

Exactly my point! You don't need any magic flags to tell the kernel to
strip caps. The algorithm is this:
1) kernel ELF loader checks for CAP section
2) if found, apply deny mask
3) if found and if uid=0 and suid set, apply grant mask.

Well, you did ask for it. But apologies anyway.

Fine. No need for any magic flags, be it suid-root or the sticky bit.

The kernel can always look at the CAP ELF section and apply the deny
mask. I don't understand your reference to queer inheritance.

Agreed, if you will always run named as root. In which case you just
fill in the cap deny mask. No magic flags needed.

I do indeed think of root as all-powerful. It is effectively the same
as CAP_GRANT. Whoever has that privilege is all-powerful. We may as
well call that UID=0.
You can always strip away caps and be left with a diminished
root. Take away CAP_SUID and that process (with UID=0) can no longer
grant privileges.
And don't worry about the root account: you can always disable logins
or use PAM to reduce capabilities. That will strip root.

No he doesn't. It's quite resonable to give junior admins access to a
FS which is mounted with the "sticky-means caps" option. But he
doesn't want to check up on the juniors. With the suid-root scheme, it
doesn't matter. Juniors can write as much as they like but can't ever
grant caps.

I think the assumption you've been making is that a file needs to be
suid-root in order to *deny* caps. That is not the case. You only need
suid-root to *grant* caps.

I've actually thought about the issues. And I'm sorry if you felt I
was being rude. I'm trying to be matter-of-fact. I'm interested in the
idea, not who came up with it.

That and other problems. Even for the older kernel problem, I don't
see any workable solutions. Please explain how you solve this
situation:
- some FS is mounted with "sticky means caps" option
- FS has write access to some directories for junior sysadmins
- reboot to 2.0
- junior creates file with CAP ELF header and does chmod +t file
- reboot to 2.3
- junior runs file. Oops.
Please don't tell me to run a find and kill all new files with sticky
bits. That's just slow and ugly.

Yes. Actually, my NFS server is running Linux 2.0.

Forget IRIX. Think Linux 2.0. Or even Linux 2.2. The sticky bit means
nothing and anybody can set it. The point is I stick a whole lot of
binaries (maybe even a shared /usr) on the NFS server. As far as the
server is concerned, they're just files. Binary compatibility has
nothing to do with it.
