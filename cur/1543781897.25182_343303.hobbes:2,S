	Well, I included the patch in my last email.  For the latest
spin, I've created 
http://oss.oracle.com/git/configfs.git.
  The ocfs2
git repositories (
http://oss.oracle.com/git/ocfs2-dev.git,
http://oss.oracle.com/git/ocfs2.git
) are now based on the configfs one.
	If there's any other way you want me to do it, let me know.
