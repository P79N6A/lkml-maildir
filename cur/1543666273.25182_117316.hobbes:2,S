That's a fair point, but 
        "Goal of this project is to create version managment system
        compatible with BitKeeper"
isn't actually claiming full compatibility.
And before you say it, yes, I know that being compatible with bk
involves _much_ more than just reading its repositories.

Absolutely.  I'm not questioning your right to get inaccurate
comparisons corrected or removed.  I'm just questioning whether you have
the right to demand that _all_ comparisons with BitKeeper be removed,
even when they are truthful (eg. "this project can read some
BitKeeper[tm] repositories.)
Cheers,
