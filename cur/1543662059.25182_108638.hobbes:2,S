Thankyou for using the development kernel and sharing your woes...

This has me completely mystified.  If I understand correctly, an event
on server 1 causes a failure to commuinicate between server 2 and some
third party..
I can only imagine that as server 1 boots it does something to server
2.  At the very least it sends a mount request for D and E.  I'm not
sure how a mount request for D or E would affect F or G.
Are you using an automounter at all?

Can you capture the panic and send it to me please?

I think this might be a reiserfs problem.  Someone else mentioned that
this started happening when they upgrade from an earlier 2.5 kernel.
If you can capture the NFS traffic 
	tcpdump -s 1500 -w /tmp/afile host $server and host $client
we could have a look at the directory cookies and see what is
happening.

I've seen this, but it was fixed by the time 2.5.59 came out.
If/when it happens again, could you please check if the IP address of
the client in question is in
    /proc/net/rpc/auth.unix.ip/content
and if the name found there is in
    /proc/fs/nfs/exports
next to the appropriate filesystem.
