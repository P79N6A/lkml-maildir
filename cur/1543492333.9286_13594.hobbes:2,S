Sounds like a fine idea (though the gnu/linux thread itself seems
really silly to me). It might work well to have such a forum. However,
I've never seen anyone successfully move an off-topic thread from a
mailing list once it starts up. So it will help but not solve everything.
Myself, I just use a threaded view of the mail and skip the ones
unsuitable to me. But it's still a big win to have separate forums (eg
your linux-social list; it keeps thread types categorised).
BTW, I think "linux-social" seems like the wrong flavour if the
gnu/linux thread is the protypical content (it seems to be for party
plans). "linux-dieas" seems more aimed at brainstorming (like the noisy
and repetitive mozilla-wishlist list).  "linux-political-correctness"?
(I was going to say "linux-pc", but that's an even worse name:-)
I guess I cast a vote for "linux-ideas" or maybe "linux-nontech"?

Every program has at least one bug and can be shortened by at least one
instruction -- from which, by induction, it is evident that every
program can be reduced to one instruction that does not work.
