It doesn't matter.  The memory pressure flag is an *advisory*
flag.  If we get it wrong the worst that'll happen is that we'd
waste some time doing work that'll be thrown away.
Please look at the places where it's used before jumping to
conclusions.

As long as we get it right most of the time (and I think you
would agree that we do get it right most of the time), then
this flag has achieved its purpose.

In any case, this actually illustrates why the addition of
volatile is completely pointless.  Even if this code was
broken, which it definitely is not, having the volatile
there wouldn't have helped at all.
