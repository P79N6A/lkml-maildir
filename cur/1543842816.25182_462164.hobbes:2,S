yes - but loading a null selector is a special-case: you dont have to 
invalidate/reload the shadow, you just have to turn access off. This 
might or might not make a difference on modern CPUs (it makes a 
difference with older CPUs) - but it's worth a try nevertheless. You 
measured a 9 cycles degradation with the %gs method, we could recover 
some of that.
