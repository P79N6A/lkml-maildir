Subject: 2.3.40-6 won't boot -- pci prob?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

When I build 2.3.39 with the 40-6 patch I get the following on boot:
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfdba1
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Interrupt Routing Table found at 0xc00f5f30 [router type 8086/1234]
I have to cycle power to restart. The computer is a NEC-6260 laptop (in
a docking station) running RedHat 6.1. .config attached.
