if the topic is for autoconverting the uintXX_t (and related) types to __uXX 
(and related), then that's easy to do i would think.  i can post a patch to do 
that.

the structures that go through ioctls rarely are an issue.  trouble often 
brews when dealing with POSIX functions that have a very similar (if not 
direct) version in the kernel interface that utilize structures.  i mention 
the fcntl structure because ive seen that with a couple of packages where the 
version in the kernel headers conflicts with the version in the C library.  or 
where the kernel ABI structure is not directly compatible with the POSIX C 
library structure ... the stat struct is an example of this where the C 
library has to know the layout of both and converts one to the other.
looking at asm-generic/fcntl.h, i'd propose this change as a template:
...
#ifdef __KERNEL__
# define kernel_flock flock
#endif
struct kernel_flock {
...
