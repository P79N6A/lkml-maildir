- skb->len is the wrong thing (tm), since it's 0 until skb_put().
- I have not found a field that contains the actual size of the data 
area of an skb.
- the results must be identical for map and unmap.
- I could recalculate the size of the allocation from np->rx_buf_sz, but 
I don't like that. Right now it would work, but it's too subtile that 
changing rx_buf_sz while there are outstanding rx buffers results in a 
iommu memory leak.
Therefore I decided to calculate the mapping size with "skb->end - 
skb->data": The size of the mapping for an skb is calculated by looking 
at fields in the skb, no knowledge about driver fields.

The bugfix is in 0.49 - it's just a bit larger, I would consider it for 
2.5.16.
