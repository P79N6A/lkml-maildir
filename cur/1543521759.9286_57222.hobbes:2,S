Hello,
	I have recently purchased an ASUS K7M motherboard with and athlon
500Mhz, I have also purchased a fridge freezer to store it in ( Not
really ). 
	My previous system was an AMDK6-450 using a motherboard with an VIA
MVP3 chip set. The Bus master DMA worked fine on this motherboard and I
received 17MB/s transfer rates.
	Knowing that the K7M Also used a VIA chip set, I made the assumption
that this motherboard would also have DMA support, so I decided "What
the hell" and got one.
	I tested the transfer rates to find they were about 4mb/s. The transfer
method I used in the testing of both systems was...
date ; cat 60mbfile.lump > /dev/null ; date
Then dividing the size by the time etc.
	It would seem that even though the start up output would suggest that
it has picked up my new K7M VIA chip set, and is using it, quite clearly
it is not. I have tried the following by the way...
hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/hda.
Recompile the kernel with DMA as default/ PCI IDE bus master etc.
Using the same hard disk for both tests.
I can only assume that there is some kind of difference in the chip sets
( I think the new motherboard is MVP4 ), and this is stopping the DMA
mode from working.
I can only guess that other new motherboards, such as those using the
I820 from intel will have this problem.
If you consider this worth fixing ( which I would very much appreciate
), I would be glad to give you all the help I can, which is not much, as
I can only program in Java(tm)(c).
If I sound like an idiot ( which I am ) then please send me a mail back
to tell me so, please include the reasons in your mail.
Thanks,
Martin Sarrionandia.
