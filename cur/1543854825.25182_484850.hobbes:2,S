I think so. A quick look at Mei's patch, I found the patch can't help our case.
The current situation is  that the application need 8 M memory, but
ther is only 5M free memory, cached memory eat almost 40Mbyte. When
the application is requesting the memory, kernel just report failure,
not attempt to release the VFS cache and try it again.
