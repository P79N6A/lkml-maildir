Well, OK, that's not an in-kernel issue.
My current thought for this is that deriving the unique name can be
awfully device specific (even in SCSI there are several fallback methods
plus the usual black/white list of things that don't quite return
entirely unique objects).  Thus, I think the derivation probably belongs
in userspace as part of hotplug.  Once the unique ID is determined, it
could be written to a well known place in the sysfs tree for all the
rest of the OS (things like udev for persistent device naming) to use.
