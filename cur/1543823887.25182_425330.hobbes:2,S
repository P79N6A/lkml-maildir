the patch looks good, and it certainly wont cause stability problems 
(this type of code typically doesnt). It may cause interactivity 
problems, but then again this affects boundary conditions, so i'm fairly 
optimistic. So if we have say more than say 4 days until 2.6.17 i'd 
suggest it for immediate inclusion.
