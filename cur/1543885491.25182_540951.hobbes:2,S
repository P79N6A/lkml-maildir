No need.  gmail has done that slowing down all by themselves quite handily..
VGER has dedicated number of streams to gmail, and bigger pools to elsewere.
The gmail parallelism-pool is configured so that daily message volume does
usually make it thru in a day.  I would prefer it going much faster...
If you are interested to see VGER's queues and monitor gauges, they are viewable
with tools at web-page:

Most of what it tells is not easily understandable, and much needs deep internal
system knowledge to be understood at all - but mostly the queue display is
self-explanatory.
