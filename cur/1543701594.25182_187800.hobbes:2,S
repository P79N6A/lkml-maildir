Define 50% ;) In case you are talking about 50% of all the available 
resources, in case of a 2 way SMP this is pretty obvious since a 
single thread cannot run simultaneuosly on two CPUs. In case of an HT 
core, this is not true since the single thread will expand using the whole 
core resources. Note though that it won't be an expansion to 100%, and 
this is the reason of the existence of the HT technology. That is, even 
with monster length pipelines, the CPU is not able to keep exec units 100% 
full using a single dispatch unit.
