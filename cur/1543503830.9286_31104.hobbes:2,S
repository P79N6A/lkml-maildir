There is no way the printk() will ever be called. If the sizeof()
operator returns a result that won't fit in 32 bits, you will need
over 4 GB to boot your kernel. Your compile will most likely fail.

If the top half of sizeof() gets trashed, your compiler is broken.
The compiler will crash. You should report this to the gcc maintainers.
BTW, one should use %p for pointers, not %zd.
If it is the explicit cast you object to, you can try this hack:
#define sizeof (unsigned)sizeof
