As a basic rule, never mount the same block device from two OS's (even 
if they are the same model).
Even if you could "disable" read cache from the Linux side, what makes 
you think that the "other OS" (or even vmware) isn't doing some write 
caching that will ruin it for you?
If you want a "shared space" between the 2 OS'es I would suggest you 
share at a higher level, like a sharing a directory on the "other OS" 
and mount it using samba on Linux through a virtual network card (or the 
other way around).
