FYI most kernel threads do background work, that doesn't have hard 
real-time constraints. Why should my audio recording session get 
interrupted (read: "sent to the trashcan") just because the swap daemon 
decided that it was a good time to write some pages out? Couldn't it 
have waited just a few more milliseconds?
You don't seem to realize that you have just arrived to this mailing 
list and missed years of discussions on kernel architecture.
If you keep a learning attitude, there is a chance for this discussion 
to go on. However, if you keep the "Come now, don't bullshit me, this is 
a broken architecture and you're just trying to cover up" attitude, 
you're just going to get discarded as a troll.
I personally like the linux way: "root has the ability to shoot himself 
in the foot if he wants to". This is my computer, damn it, I am the one 
who tells it what to do.
This is much, much better than the "users are stupid, we must protect 
them from themselves" kind of way that other OS'es use.
Just my 0.02 euros,
