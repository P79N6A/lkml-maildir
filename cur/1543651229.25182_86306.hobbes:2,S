I would forget about the update-fstab script. Why merge?
There is lots of precedent for the .d/ directories in /etc. These
directories are mostly for the benefit of packages, and they have no
update-foo scripts.
/etc/crontab &  /etc/cron.(hourly|daily|weekly|monthly)/ & /etc/cron.d/
/etc/logrotate.conf & /etc/logrotate.d/
/etc/profile & /etc/profile.d/
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf & /etc/httpd/conf.d/
/etc/xinetd.conf & /etc/xinetd.d/
/etc/lvmtab & /etc/lvmtab.d/
/etc/makedev.d/
/etc/pam.d/
