I am, but I have no benchmarks that give any useful numbers.

Actually, with the current scheduler, updatedb really sucks.  It's supposed to 
be a background task, but it hogs IO resources and memory like crazy 
(disclaimer: it's my personal subjective observation).

Frankly, if I had any useful benchmark, I would have readily run it and posted 
the results.  The problem is that I don't know what kind of results you are 
interested in.  Please let me know what _exactly_ you want to measure.  
Please propose some benchmarks or post a HOWTO, or what.  "Help me help you".

I think the problem is that relatively not so many people run -mm, and even 
less people try to use them for a longer time.  Also, there sometimes are 
some issues with -mm that must be sorted out first, but then there's not much 
time left for testing the scheduler before the next -mm.
