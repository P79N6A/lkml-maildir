We SHOULD ??? You ARE joking, right ? Last time I checked Linus had power
to make such decisions, not you. And he stated his approach quite clearly:
-- cut --
Finally, even if the above isn't true, I often reject bug-fixes.
Bug-fixes are _often_ worse than the bug they fix, even with serious bugs.
Because a lot of bug-fixes are "band-aid" - not fixing the bug properly.
And band-aid is BAD. It's worse than even a crashing machine. Because
band-aid never goes away, and nobody cleans it up.
I prefer to have a known bug that will eventually get fixed than an ugly
solution that will hide it forever.

You do not want to play by this rules ? Fine - go to FreeBSD, BeOS or Windows.
Full removal of this crap (so you will be unable to use hdparm to play with
UDMA settings anymore) cas pass Linus test, Andre's patch - no.

It's NOT. It's band-aid, not proper solution.

May be. If so then Linux is doomed and you can play other games. But it's
general Linus principle and you need REAL STRONG argument to go against
this principle. PLEASE try to undertstood that you DO NOT need al lot of
arguments to reject such patches - Linus's rule cuted above is more then
enough. Quite an opposite: you need REAL STRONG argument to apply such patch.

Hmm. I think that such patch Linus can accept. I'm not sure Andre will be
very happy with such patch though: this will remove possibility to play with
UDMA modes and Andre looks quite fond of Linux UDMA support.

It'll remove ability to play with UDMA settings and such. So you brand-new
system will use what was selected by defaul - DMA33 or may be even PIO mode
instead of UDMA66/UDMA100 and you will have no knobs to change it. Arrange it
with Andre first, Ok ?
