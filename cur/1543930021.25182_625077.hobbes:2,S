When you read server, don't read it as localized; a server can be 
distributed.  What distinguishes a server from an engine is that it has to 
handle a multi-user use-case.  How that is implemented, locally or remotely 
or distributed, is another issue.

As explained before in this thread, replicating the git tree on the client 
still doesn't provide the required transparency.

You need to re-read the thread.
Thanks!
