Hi 
I'm new to the linux kernel, so please be patient. 
I have a P4 notebook with a via chipset and a mobile P4. In Windows XP my 
built in network device works without problems. In linux the device hangs a 
after some time of >90kB/s datatransfers. I have to completely reset my 
notebook to get it working again 
I'm not sure if it is a hardware or a kernel problem. How can I debug this 
to find out if it is a kernel bug and where it is ? 
I have to use pci=biosirq, otherwise the kernel warns me, that it can't 
change the interupts for my devcies. 
At bootup the device identifies itself as  
via-rhine.c:v1.10-LK1.1.13  Nov-17-2001  Written by Donald Becker

eth0: VIA VT6102 Rhine-II at 0xd000, 00:40:45:07:ba:06, IRQ 11. 
eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x786d advertising 05e1 Link 0021. 
When it stops working I get a lot of messages like: 
kernel eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0000, PHY status 786d, resetting... 
kernel eth0: Reset did not  complete in 10ms. 
 
Another message I quite often get is: 
mtrr: no more MTRRs available 
 
 
I'm thankfull for any help 
 
Kind regards
