Okay I've pushed all the first set of changes from the DRM CVS tree into
the BK repo above. I'm going to move to a repo on bkbits rsn, will send an
updated URL when I do so ..
I think there is one major changeset outstanding that I'll get around to
in the next couple of days, the only other changes I can see between the
trees are compatibility changes for 2.4 which I don't really want to put
into the 2.6 tree unless totally necessary...
I'd say let it be checked out in Andrews tree for a while and then I'll
ask Andrew to push it all onto Linus...
Dave.
