You don't waste CPU polling all day! The name 'poll' seems to imply
that, but it does not use CPU wile waiting (what it does is looks if
event is already pending and add current to wait queue on each
descriptor - the function that makes data available then wakes it up).
And it's a whole lot faster than signals. Signal setup is slower than
context switch.

Which is _exactly_ what poll does, just more work! (because you have to
write things poll_wait would do for you and you have to be very
careful).
