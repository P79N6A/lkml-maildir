<body>Hello :-)<br><br>
Could anyone provide some information or point me in a better direction to<br>
understand:<br>
<br>
1) Why multi-threaded processes currently do not dump core when they crash.<br>
2) What needs to be done in the kernel or elsewhere to make multi-threaded<br>
processes dump core when they crash...<br>
3) Who is currently working on this problem and how I could help them.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>
Jason Eager<br>
