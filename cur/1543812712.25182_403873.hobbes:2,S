For IPoIB maybe but not for native IB which offloads all transport to
the HCA... I'd be surprised if the bottleneck were anywhere other than
the bus, even on niagara.

Yeah, I've always wanted to make the MSI stuff generic and handle the
embedded ppc chips that have MSI, but I've never had a good enough
reason to really work on it -- it's just been at the level of "that
would be fun."  Now that IBM cares I hope it will get done soon.
Anyway IB works fine with standard INTx interrupts -- MSI is just icing.
The Niagara boxes seem like a fun toy if I can get budget for it --
and 32 threads are probably good for flushing out SMP races.
