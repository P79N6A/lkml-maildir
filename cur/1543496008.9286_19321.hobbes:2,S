G'day all,
I am trouble with 2.2.8 (UP), on my P75 with 40 Meg RAM. After a couple of
hours, depending on how busy it is, many processes start going into 'D'
state. It seems to be only new processes that are going into 'D' State.
Also the system is running rather low on memory (about 900k). I can't log
onto this machine anymore, but I can ping it. I can't even shutdown
because 'shutdown' goes into 'D' state.
I am currently compiling 2.2.9, to see if this makes a difference.
Cheers Mof.
