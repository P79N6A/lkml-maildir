Yes, thanks for reminding me.

It's not that bad, you really only have to touch
include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h from which all the other .lds files
are generated.  There are 2 others, arch/m68knommu/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
and arch/v850/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S which seem to not use this file, and
that's it.
See my EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_FUTURE() patch for an example of all that
should need to be done to modify this file for this feature.
And yes, I agree that we should do it to fix the issues you have pointed
out.
thanks again,
greg k-h
