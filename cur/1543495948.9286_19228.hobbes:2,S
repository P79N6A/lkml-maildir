Of course it would need to be implemented in this way: initially
disabled, enabled only by writing a password into sysctl. If you want
to do it _right_, require an SHA hash over the current time (perhaps
in 10 sec granularity, or 8 sec because that's easy to implement :-)
and the sysctl-set password. (SHA is in the kernel already.)
