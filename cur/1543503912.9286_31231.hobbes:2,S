There's no IDE issue -- the cy82c693 driver works fine -- but rather a
problem with one of the assumptions made by the new resource allocation
framework.  Namely, that pci_io_resource caps at 64k.
Even with that, I believe things still function, it's just that the
accelerated mode bails out because the request_resource fails.
