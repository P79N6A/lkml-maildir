As well, these usually use two banks of memory.
I have a pair of crucial 256 meg sticks in my home pc, one is single sided
and one is double sided.  when I decide that 512 meg isn't enough, I have
to make sure I get a stick that uses only one bank of ram, as my ASUS
p4B533-e shares DIMM2 and DIMM3's banks.  You can only have single sided
dimms in it if you want to use both at once.
