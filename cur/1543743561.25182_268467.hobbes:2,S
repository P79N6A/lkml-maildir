I cannot do that as it apparently was a transient thing.  After the 
reboot to the next kernel in the series, everythings has been working 
as well as can be expected.  I've listened to the radio for about 30 
seconds, and the tv maybe 6 hours since.
Now that I know howto make the magic sysrq actually work and leave 
meaningfull stuff in the logs, maybe I can report something that 
might be constructive the next time it happens.  Until then, I wait 
for the other shoe I guess.
