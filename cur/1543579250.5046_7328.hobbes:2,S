(it's TUX 2.0 meanwhile), and yes, TUX uses it. We speculatively delay ACK
of parsed input packet in the hope of merging it with the first output
packet. If the output frame does not happen for 200 msecs then we send a
standalone ACK to be RFC-conform. This way TUX can do single-packet web
replies for small requests. (well, plus SYN-ACK and FIN-ACK)
