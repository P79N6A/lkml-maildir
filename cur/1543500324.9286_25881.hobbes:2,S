Hi,
I was wondering if anyone is successfully using the nfsv3 client patches with
solaris 2.6/7 servers.  Up until revision 0.9.4.3, performance (for my
network) was about the same as solaris/solaris.  The numbers below
(as reported by bonnie), show the recent problem:
(linux-2.2.9 client, solaris 7 server, nfsv3 mounts)
            -------Sequential Output-------- ---Sequential Input-- --Random--
            -Per Char- --Block--- -Rewrite-- -Per Char- --Block--- --Seeks---
Machine  MB K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU K/sec %CPU  /sec %CPU
0.9.3    50   857 10.5   866  1.7   915  2.1  9390 100.1 256193 100.1 635.5  3.2
0.9.4.3  50   869 10.6   873  1.5   917  1.8  9389  99.9 257310 100.5 614.7  2.9
0.9.5     1     3 98.9   929  0.0   974  1.0  9575 102.9 255999   0.0 412.4  2.2
The poor performance is unchanged for all versions since 0.9.5 up to and
including 0.9.9.1 under linux-2.2.10.
As best as I can tell, the problem is related to the file net/sunrpc/xprt.c
If I apply patch 0.9.9.1 to linux-2.2.10 and then clobber only xprt.c
with the version from patch 0.9.4.3, the performance is restored.  Using 
'snoop' on solaris, it seems as though the linux client is flooding the 
network with UDP packets.  In fact, to write 1 megabyte, snoop captures 10 
times as many packets with recent versions of the nfsv3 patches as compared 
to version 0.9.4.3. 
nfsv2 mounts seem to be unaffected.
