The image of the file being executed has to exist because
the text portion could be needed at any time for a page in.
You can move it in the same filesystem (since the open file handle 
stays the same), or even delete it (since it doesn't disappear till
last reference goes away). but you can't unmount the file system because
the inode is still busy.
