hdparm for SATA/PATA has now been updated to version 8.2.
Upgrading is strongly recommended for all users.
This version fixes several bugs in earlier 7.x/8.x releases
that could cause issues when advanced features are attempted
on devices being driven by the old drivers/ide subsystem.
libata devices were unaffected, but drivers/ide devices could
misbehave or even be corrupted by some operations.
hdparm-8.2 is available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hdparm/
 
Upgrading from any earlier 7.x or 8.x version
is strongly recommended for all users.
Cheers
