Something on your system creates bogus NMI interrupts. What chipset
are you using exactly?
Sometimes chipsets can be programmed to raise NMIs when an PCI bus
error occurs. 
21 is the normal state (PIT timer running, but no errors logged) 
If you have an AMD 8131 it could be in theory erratum 54, but then
normally one of the error bits in reason should be set.
