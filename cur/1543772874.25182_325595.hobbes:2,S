You don't actually use the PCI_FIXUP macros. You make a new one called
ACPI_FIXUP and run them right after ACPI is read and before you do
anything else. I was just illustrating how the quirk fixup system
worked.
To make it work on my system I just added an assignment statement for
the fix right after the ACPI code looked for the HPET entry. But
that's not a general solution, building the ACPI_FIXUP macros is one.
