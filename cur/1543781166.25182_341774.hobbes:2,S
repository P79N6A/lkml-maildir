Indeed this fixes it on my P4 so that it does skip ticks. However presumably 
due to the code change I am having the reverse behaviour from previously - it 
pauses for ages when using PIT - worse so than previously in that if I dont 
generate interrupts with my mouse or keyboard it just sits there 
indefinitely. Having said that, it seems to work fine in APIC mode. 
Without any modifications yet (I won't touch the code while you're busy with 
it), here is a rolled up patch of yours on top of mine for those wanting to 
try all the code:
