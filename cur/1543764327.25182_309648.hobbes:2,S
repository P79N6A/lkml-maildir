well these patches shouldn't really affect it..

In theory yes, but there isn't really anything you can do except reboot,
as usually the CP (command processor) is hung, and you have to do a full
GPU reset, I can't imagine X or Linux consoles surviving it too well...
ATI have a VPU Recover in their windows driver which does it.. but they
know their cards a bit better than we do..
it might be worth turning Render acceleration off Option "RenderAccel"
"No" in xorg.conf and see if it gets any stabler...
