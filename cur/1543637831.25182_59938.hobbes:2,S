Maybe you are asking for the wrong thing here...
What you want is probably an "flash based persistent storage that can be 
booted from" not specifically USB - correct?
If that is the case - you do not want to use USB memory but rather
CompactFlash - since they are both compatible with PCMCIA _and_ IDE.
You only need a ribbon cable and a small adapter (the adapter is really 
simple)!
A quick search on google for "CompactFlash IDE" or "Compact flash IDE" will 
give you several hits.
Since they are compatible with IDE you can use any MB including
most PC/104 variant - many of those can also be booted from DiskOnChip...

An compact flash IDE is VERY small... If you can not fit it in the case you
have other problems...
