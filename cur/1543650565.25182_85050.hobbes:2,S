	There is no such thing as the local IPv4 addresses of a given
node. IP addresses are assigned for each network interfaces, so you
may have more than one IP address. Note that I have many systems that
don't have any "eth0" and still have many IP addresses (on wlan0,
ppp0, bnep0...).
	On top of that, the DNS may assign an IP address that map to
your current hostname (which may correspond to one of the addresses
above). That's purely a user space stuff.
	So, you are basically starting on a wrong assumption, the
information you are looking for doesn't exist, and I therefore suspect
that you need to rethink the thing you want to do.
	I suggest you use a user space application to pick the IP
address most relevant to your setup (i.e. policy decision) and inject
it in your module.
	Good luck,
	Jean
