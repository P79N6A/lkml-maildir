Andrea, Bill, great, thanks a lot for doing all the fieldwork on this.
After going through the discussions, I'm inclined to stick with the
patch as is i.e. "correct the 2.6 bug" in the "shared" third field of
/proc/pid/statm, rather than adding this as another field on the end.
Once 2.6.9 is out and we're open for patches again, I'll break it
into the four parts originally outlined, and send to Andrew.
Hugh
