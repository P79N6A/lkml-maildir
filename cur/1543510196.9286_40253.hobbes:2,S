I know about this, but not a clue to resolve the issue.
I have brought up the issue with Promise and they are working with me.
There is a duplicate issue with M$'s NT, I hope to get the method of
resolution to this problem and not "miniport" code.
First test to verify the problem, build another kernel that is UP.
Include raid and rag the hell out of the box.
This should not fail, based upon other test reports.
If the box throttles in UP, the driver core is RAID UP Stable.
Second, disable RAID under SMP and push a sequencal access on the last
two channels.
What is the irq routing table for this board?
Did you remove all the Promise BIOS chips execpt for the one that
registers hde/f/g/h ?
Have you patched with "ide.2.2.12.19990921.patch.bz2"?
New Promise OEM support.
You are required to set these for more than two cards.
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
PDC202XX_FORCE_BURST_BIT=y
