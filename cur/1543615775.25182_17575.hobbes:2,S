this is the next, bugfix release of the O(1) scheduler:
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.5.2-B0.patch
	
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.4.17-B0.patch
This release could fix the lockups and crashes reported by some people.
Changes:
 - remove the likely/unlikely define from sched.h and include compiler.h.
   (Adrian Bunk)
 - export sys_sched_yield, reported by Pawel Kot.
 - turn off 'child runs first' temporarily, to see the effect.
 - export nr_context_switches() as well, needed by ReiserFS.
 - define resched_task() in the correct order to avoid compiler warnings
   on UP.
 - maximize the frequency of timer-tick driven load-balancing to 100 per
   sec.
 - clear ->need_resched in the RT scheduler path as well.
 - simplify yield() support, remove TASK_YIELDED and __schedule_tail().
Comments, bug reports, suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
