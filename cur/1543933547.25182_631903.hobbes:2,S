As James said I'm away right now and computer access is limited.  However, I'm stuck in the airport right now and spent some time looking at the code ... Based on what has been found so far I wonder if the problem isn't a race but a problem of skb->iif never being initialized correctly?  To my untrained eye it looks like __netdev_alloc_skb() should be setting skb->iif (like it does for skb->dev) but it currently doesn't.
Am I barking up the wrong tree here?
