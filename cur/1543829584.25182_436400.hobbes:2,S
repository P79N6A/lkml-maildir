Sorry.  NVIDIA's future SATA controllers are going to be AHCI (so for
0104 RAID mode, we want the ahci driver to pick up these controllers.
We don't want future chips (chips for which we didn't add the proper
device IDs yet into their respective drivers) to be picked up by sata_nv
anymore.
What's missing, I realize now, is the 0104 generic entry that should be
in the ahci driver.  I'll send along a separate patch for that.
