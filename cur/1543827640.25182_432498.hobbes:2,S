Well I don't think so. Please show me which part of this code is
_only_ applicable to EXTREME.
The only thing that makes it applicable to EXTREME is not in the code
but rather in the Kconfig script:
        config SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
                def_bool y
                depends on SPARSEMEM && !SPARSEMEM_STATIC
