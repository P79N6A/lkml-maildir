Thanks for your quick reply. You mean I must select?
	Console drivers/Frame-buffer support/SIS acceleration
The help for this option says:
	This is the frame buffer device driver for the SiS 630 and 640
	Super Socket 7 UMA cards. Specs available at www.sis.com.tw.
But this is not my card, which is a SiS 6329.
Thanks again!
