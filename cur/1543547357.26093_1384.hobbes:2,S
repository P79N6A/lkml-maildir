i'd like to have waitqueue based (kernel-space) semaphores such as the
SysV semaphores are, not signal or sched_yield() based ones.

i dont understand why this is such an important category. If the sharing
is very high between the threads then it makes sense to use 'shared-all
threads'. But frequently the example given are webservers, which often do
not have alot of cross-request shared state.

well, Linux SysV shared memory indeed has a 'software version' of
pagetables, this way if one process faults in a new page (because all
pages are unmapped originally), then the new physical page address can be
discovered by all other subsequent faults in other process contexts. It
works just fine - the thing i dislike about SysV shared memory is not the
VM part but its 'filesystem characteristics' - i think anonymous shared
memory is the way to go.

well (in Linux) you can specify it on a per-filedescriptor level wether to
share or not to share, and you can pass a filedescriptor to another
process and you can establish it there. Is there any API missing in this
area?

it's not slow, it's 'slower' in the 'common memory allocation' case.
