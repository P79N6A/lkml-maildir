err, no, I misinterpreted what you meant by "other zones would be ok..". I 
though you were suggesting the reuse of zone names for some reason.
The zone used to for ZONE_MOVABLE is the highest populated zone on the 
architecture. On some architectures, that will be ZONE_HIGHMEM. On others, 
it will be ZONE_DMA. See the function find_usable_zone_for_movable()
ZONE_MOVABLE never spans zones. For example, it will not use some 
ZONE_HIGHMEM and some ZONE_NORMAL memory.

It's harder for the user to setup all right. But it works within limits 
that are known well in advance and doesn't add additional code to the main 
allocator path. Once it's setup, it acts like any other zone and zone 
behavior is better understood than anti-fragmentations behavior.

On the other hand, percentages make it harder for the administrator to 
know in advance how much unmovable memory will be available when the 
system starts even if the machine changes configuration. The absolute 
figure is easier to understand. If there was a requirement, an alternative 
configuration option could be made available that takes a fixed percentage 
of each node with memory.

The code only cares about memory, not processors.

Then what I'd do is specify kernelcore to be
(number_of_nodes_with_processors * largest_amount_of_memory_on_node_with_processors)
That would have all memory near processors available as unmovable memory 
(that movable allocations will still use so they don't always go remote) 
while keeping a large amount of memory on the headless nodes for movable 
allocations only.
If requirements demanded, a configuration option could be made that allows 
the administrator to specify exactly how much unmovable memory he wants on 
a specific node.
