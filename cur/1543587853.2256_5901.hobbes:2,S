Hi Pavel,
I think init is doing a perfect job WRT UPSs because this is a trivial
application of power management. init wasn't really meant for this.
According to its man page:
"init...it's primary role is to create processes from a script in the file
/etc/inittab...It also controls autonomous processes required by any
particular system"
We are going to need some software that handles button events, as well as
thermal events, battery events, polling the battery, AC adapter status
changes, sleeping the system, and more.
We need WAY more flexibility than init provides. I find the argument that
init is already handling one minor power-related thing an unconvincing
reason why we should cram all power management through it.
Unix philosophy: "do one thing and do it well".
