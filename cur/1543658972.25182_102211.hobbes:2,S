Now I've really grown tired of that line over the course of my career. 
It's not a matter of what language you are using, it's all about good 
design and reuse. I've got plenty of C libraries and C++ classes (and 
now some Java classes) I wrote way back in the Ice Age that, in some 
form or another, myself and a lot of others still use today.
The true "reality" of those languages is that they are designed for so 
called "developers" that cannot possibly comprehend the operations and 
information that the language hides from them!
OK, so I'm partially joking in that last statement :)  Remember the old 
acronym "RAD"? I will certainly give credit to tools like Delphi in that 
respect (Visual Basic, however, makes me sick - Basic should have died 
with the Commodore 64 and TRS80).
