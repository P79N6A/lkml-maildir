As usual completely wrong:
ioctl code is called with interrupts enabled. So if you need to protect
against interrupts it is completely correct to use spin_lock_irq /
spin_unlock_irq. There is nothing to save and nothing to restore.

Instead of blurbing about obvious things you should point Luong to the
real problems:
include/linux/wait.h:
/*
 * These are the old interfaces to sleep waiting for an event.
 * They are racy.  DO NOT use them, use the wait_event* interfaces above.
 * We plan to remove these interfaces during 2.7.
 */
extern void FASTCALL(sleep_on(wait_queue_head_t *q));
extern long FASTCALL(sleep_on_timeout(wait_queue_head_t *q,
                                      signed long timeout));
extern void FASTCALL(interruptible_sleep_on(wait_queue_head_t *q));
extern long FASTCALL(interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(wait_queue_head_t *q,
                                                    signed long timeout));
Luong, please use wait_event_interruptible() instead.
	spin_lock_irq(dev->lock);
	do_whatever_you_need_to_initialize(dev);
	dev->event_happened = 0;
	spin_unlock_irq(dev->lock);
	
	res = wait_event_interruptible(&dev->queue, dev->event_happened != 0);
Thanks,
