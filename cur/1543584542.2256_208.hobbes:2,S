It's not just a sector-number and ll_rw_blk/elevator issue.  The limit
goes all the way up to the users of the block device, be they the
filesystem, buffer cache or block read/write layer.  
This is especially true for filesystems like XFS which need a 512-byte
blocksize.  At least with ext2 you can set the blocksize to 4kB and
get some of the benefit of larger block devices without having to
overflow the 32-bit block number.
Cheers,
 Stephen
