I am a newbie in kernel programming.
And am sorry if something related previously asked.
I wonder if it is possible to following situation is possible or not.
let say i have a user process p1.
p1 does some malloc, and file i/o etc
i initiate it during boot time.
it stays resident in memory as if kernel it self (??)
and its priority is very very high
