But why does it need to have memory below 1Gb ?? Normally, 32bit PCI DMA
controllers (such as network cards and disk controllers) can access up to 4GB of
physical memory within the machine, so unless you are using the CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G
option it shouldn't need bounce buffers. Or am I missing something here
(something like the second physical GB is actually in the address range
4GB->)???

There's no CONFIG option for that right (like the old CONFIG_2GB option on 2.2
kernels) ? I'll have to manually go in and edit the header files in asm-i386.
Would the 2.2 (e.g 2.2.19) kernel have the same problems with bounce buffers or
is this not implemented on 2.2 ??
