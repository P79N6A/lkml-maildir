So you'll be removing:
/sys/devices/system/node/node?/meminfo
then?
along with:
/sys/devices/system/node/node?/distance
/sys/devices/system/node/node?/numastat
and all the other things that violate the rules?
(which I do agree with ... I just don't think sysfs works for
performance stats as we've discussed several times before ;-))
