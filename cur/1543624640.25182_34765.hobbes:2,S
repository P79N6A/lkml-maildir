Ok, trying to get better message now.

I think so, but it is not possible to be sure :(

Ok, the problem:
plug a pcmcia card (network cards work perfect), ide_cs & modem fail).
unplug it
it just oops the kernel.
as ethX works perfect and modem & ide_cs fails, devfs is suspect
number one.
Then I boot with devfs=nomount
repeat the experiment, and everythnig works as expected (devfs is
decleared more suspect indeed). 
Really devfs & devfsd are suspect.
I know that ide_cs worked before because I used it to download pics
from my camera and I had never had a single problem.
Then I boot back with kernel-linus2.4.
Everything works perfect.
In the middle, I changed devfsd from version 2.3.24 to 2.3.23, same
problems.
kernel-linus2.4 works with both devfsd.
I relaunch kernel-mdk with devfs-2.3.23, this times also oops, but it
just hangs in devfs_unregister, that calls to kmem_cache_alloc(), and
them kmem_cache_grow (here is the Ooops), this is called from a bottom
handler.
With devfsd 2.3.24, it appears that there is a stack overflow inside
devfs, and kdb is of not help to detect it (we never end the do_BUG()
function because there is a borken stack.
I have do a diff of 2.4.18 against lastest mandrake kernel and there
are:
- no devfs differences
- no changes in register/unregister calls.
that means that the problem happens as a side effect of other thing.
Later, Juan.
