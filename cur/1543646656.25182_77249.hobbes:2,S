Because ... Whining Is Easy (tm)
I'm running into this all the time, with discussions that go like:
Me:       "It's hard to build a VM that does the right thing in
           every situation"
Somebody: "So why don't you build a separate desktop and server VM?"
Me:       "Umm, what would those two need to do differently ?
           What functional difference would there be ?"
Somebody: "Dunno, I don't care, why don't you just do it and figure
           out the details later?"
These discussions tend to go downhill from there...
cheers,
Rik
