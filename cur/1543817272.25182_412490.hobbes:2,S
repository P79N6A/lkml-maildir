In theory ioremap_nocache would force uncached even if there is no MTRR
and is better/clearer.
But on x86 there normally is, so lots of code gets it wrong.
My point is just that forcing a semantics that's not enforced
on x86 would be a uphill battle for everybody else. Probably not
a good idea. Better fake x86.

Why not? There are cases when it's needed.

It's unfortunately tricky to get it fully right on x86. The issue
is to have a good way avoid illegal cache aliases. There were some
attempts, but so far they never were polished up from the initial
prototypes.
