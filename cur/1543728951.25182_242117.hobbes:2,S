This is the only mail list I could find that discussed mdacon.
Mdacon appears to have no Scroll_Backward or _Forward feature (scroll
buffer) like vgacon does (shift Page Up or shift Page Down).  I use
mdacon.o with a 2-monitor system.  Is there something in vgacon.c I could
copy over to mdacon.c so I could try to compile my own version with scroll
buffer?
I have no programming experience but a friend could help.
