This is a pet peave.  _NO_ drivers should include either of these two
headers directly.  Use asm/irq.h and asm/hardware.h instead.  Audit your
code to ensure that you're including the right headers please.
I can see that I've got to do another sweep of the entire kernel code
to fix all these again.
