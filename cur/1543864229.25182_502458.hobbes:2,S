It certainly never arrived at the MTA running on my working machine.

But the code does not walk trough the endpoints anymore, that's what
it did before the change. Now, it is walking through a certain subset
of the set of integral numbers, using the numbers from those set as
offset to indirectly address something. Additionally, it is harder to
read because it contains more 'noise characters' that are not
pronouncable. Arguing about this is not really reasonable, though,
because this is mostly a matter of aesthetics and a decent compiler
will generate identical code for both, ie remove the indexing
automatically again. A sensible way to enforce regulations of code
aesthetic would be to document them.

Exactly. The 'interface' that is used here does not provide a way to
ask for the type, only to ask if the type is type X. At the source
level, this means
	if ((value & mask) == x) {
        	.
                .
                .
	} else if ((value & mask) == y) {
        	.
                .
                .
	else printf("%u\n", values & mask);
A decent compiler will again probably catch this and do CSE-removal,
but this doesn't make the algorithm more sensible as it is written
down (C is not 'math', and C-expressions don't represent equal states,
like equations would do, but request that the CPU performs certain
calcluations).

It did not claim this was 'a problem' (except insofar 'clumsiness' can
be construed to be one). It is just a code change for the sake of
having changed the code.

This may be the way you happen to like more and a lot of people will
probably agree with that. But the device does not care and they are
both functionally identical, only the 'textual complexity' of using
for is higher.

The claim that the meaning of something with a lower signal-to-noise
ratio is more obvious in itself is somewhat absurd: If I have to
understand the code, I have to read it and think about it and I may
reach the conclusion that certain calculations are actually
meaningless, but I still need to understand them first.

That is not 'a coding style difference'. It basically just means that
you didn't understand a text not written by yourself without reading
it first.

This thing has consumed something like sixteen hours of my life in
total, with a gain-to-be-expected of exactly zero (I don't need to run
'current' kernels on my work machine, I have just grown into the habit
of doing so) and those sixteen hours cannot come back (and I even have
had these type of discussions around 'should it rather look like math
or rather like text' in sufficent quantities :->), so, except that I
would be very much obliged to you if a fix for this issue could go
into the 'official' tree rather sooner than later, no.
Apart from that, I make a (fairly miserable) living by adapting open
source code to be usable in specific situations (ie adding or
modifying features, fixing bugs, writing drivers etc) and I
ocassionally have dreams in C (this is not a joke :-), ie understand
it fairly well, no matter who was the author.
