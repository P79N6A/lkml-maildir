Subject: [PATCH 0/3] cpu freq: fix problems with work_on_cpu usage in acpi-cpufreq
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This set of patches improves the work_on_cpu() function to
eliminate circular lock dependencies from occurring by requiring
the caller to insure the cpu does not go offline.  This effectively
models the previous behaviour using set_cpus_allowed().
The other fix is to use a separate work queue for work_on_cpu so
it does not clash with kevent items that might already be on the
queue from the same caller.
This fixes the boot up and suspend/resume to disk problems previously
seen.
