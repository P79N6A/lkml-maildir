Subject: [patch] KGDB for Real-Time Preemption systems

I have put a version of KGDB for x86 RT kernels here:
http://source.mvista.com/~ganzinger/
The common_kgdb_cfi_.... stuff creates debug records for entry.S and 
friends so that you can "bt" through them.  Apply in this order:
Ingo's patch
kgdb-ga-rt.patch
common_kgdb_cfi_annotations.patch
This is, more or less, the same kgdb that is in Andrew's mm tree changed 
to fix the RT issues.
