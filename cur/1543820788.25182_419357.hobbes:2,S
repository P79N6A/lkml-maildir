For instance, during speculative execution on POWER, we can take a
TLB miss for a speculative load and start a table-walk.
I'm not sure what "speculative prefetching" means in this case... just
regular hardware-initiated prefetching (where I suppose one could use the
modifier "speculative") on POWER will only prefetch to a page-boundary.
So, slightly OT, as this is not about x86 CPUs... but thought people
might be interested.
