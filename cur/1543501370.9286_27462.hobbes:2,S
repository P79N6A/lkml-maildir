Nope.  I have a rule that runs before everything else, that looks
to see if a message is directly addressed to *ME*, and if so, it
gets thrown in my INBOX first.  After that, several other
procmailrc files are included into the main one.
I have a separate procmailrc just for mailing lists.  After
duplicate filtering, and junk filtering is done, the mailing list
one gets sourced.  So any mail sent to me, gets to me directly.
Mails sent to mailing lists get sorted into the appropriate
folders.
I guess it depends on each persons ENTIRE local procmail setup,
what is best for them.  Had I been sorting on "Sender:", the mail
you sent me HAD no sender line, so the rule would have failed
anyways.
The current rule works fine.  If messages get crossposted, they
will get duplicate filtered first, and the final copy will get
thrown in the mailing list folder which has the highest
precedence in my procmailrc-mailinglists recipe file.
I can send a copy of my recipe's to anyone if they like...  Works
great.  NO problems ever with improperly filed mail.
