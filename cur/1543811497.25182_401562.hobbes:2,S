That is because too many people were making the mistake of saying 'N' to
INPUT. EMBEDDED here was really chosen while meaning EXPERT. This has
nothing to do with the kernel image size - the size of input.c is pretty
minimal anyway.

It doesn't. But in the same way making INPUT depend on EMBEDDED doesn't
make sense if you intend EMBEDDED to truly mean what it says.

It's not. Input, like sound, scsi, usb, firewire .... is just another
subsystem in the kernel. The kernel can live without it, and it used to
work just fine when all modular, including autoloading.
