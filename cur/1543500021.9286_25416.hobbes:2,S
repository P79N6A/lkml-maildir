this is the type of locking that the whole pagecache is _designed_ to
prevent. Why is it a problem that we see what another process writes? You
can see the same thing if you mmap() a page. _If_ user-space is not
coherent, the kernel doesnt have to be restrictive either. The page lock
only maintains page metadata coherency, not data coherency - that one is
fully up to user-space. [and read/write atomicity was never there and will
never be, just think what happens if a write() page-faults in the middle
of updating a pagecache page - this can happen on a UP box as well]

Your fix looks good, there might be a couple of other places we missed. We
have to update filep either within the kernel lock or within the page
lock, both are sufficiently exclusive. [note that Alexander Viro is
working on SMP-threading the VFS, which will change those places that
update filep fields.]
