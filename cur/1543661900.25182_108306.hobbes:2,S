Many of the Buslink FireWire drives have Lite-On drives inside. The
output you pasted is exactly what I'd expect from a BusLink FireWire
CD-RW.
Is this a change in behavior from previous kernels (i.e., did it show
something different in the past?) If so, what did an older kernel show?
If there's a difference, that could indeed be a bug.
Conversely, if you're merely surprised that one company manufactured the
drive and a different company put the drive into a FireWire enclosure, I
wouldn't consider that to be a bug in Linux.
