pktcdvd devices are standard writable block devices, so you can use
them for anything you want, including swapping.

Agreed. Seek times before writes are in the range of 500-1000ms on my
drives. This will probably make your machine unresponsive for a *very*
long time when you start to swap to an optical disc.
It should work though, unless you wear out your disc before it's done
swapping, in which case nasty things will probably happen. I don't
think I/O errors on a swap device can be handled in a sane way by the
kernel.

Yes. What about this code in the main loop in kcdrwd?
			/* make swsusp happy with our thread */
			if (current->flags & PF_FREEZE)
				refrigerator(PF_FREEZE);
Should it still be there when the task is marked as PF_NOFREEZE?
