The memory usage stuff seems sane. We wont free memory because its unused its
just now cached and blown away if it must be replaced

Go to 2.2.17 or higher for SMP with high TCP loads. At least one bad bug
with exactly the sort of locks you describe got fixed. Let me know if 2.2.17
behaves better I'd like to chase this one down if not

More processes is fine. It wont die if it runs out just refuse to create stuff
so you'd see cgi's failing

For static images you'll find thttpd gives way better performance generally
(

have crashes not overloading and overloading would make it slow and annoying
not die
