Ugh. I dont really know how to do that.
Isnt this sufficient?
if (TestSetPageLocked(page))
	schedule_work(...)
set_page_dirty(page)
unlock_page(page)
Thats all there seems to be set_page_dirty_lock does if it is called when
PG_Locked bit is clear.

Thanks, Nick, thats what I have now, this already works for me here
https://openib.org/svn/gen2/trunk/src/linux-kernel/infiniband/ulp/sdp/sdp_iocb.c
I'm looking at ways to improve performance, though.

Note that I am, even, not necessarily talking about full pages
here: an application could be writing to one part of a page
while hardware DMAs another part of it.
So the app is not necessarily buggy.
It seems to me people really dont want to change their applications.
They just want to load a library and have it go faster.
Given that I'm implementing a socket protocol, we are talking about
an awful lot of applications that currently work fine on top of TCP.
