Hi,
  Has anyone had a problem with lp.o in 2.4.0-test4?  The parport module 
will detect the printer port and printer and assign the to parport0 but lp.o 
says "driver loaded but no devices found."
  I have tried compiling it into the kernel and forcing it's assignment 
through lilo.  But all I get is possible IRQ conflict.
