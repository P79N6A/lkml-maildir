It would probably need to be just a pointer embedded in the allocated
block. With the current design, the memleak objects have a lifetime
longer than the tracked block. This is mainly to avoid long locking
during memory scanning and reporting.

This still leaves the issue of marking objects as not being leaks or
being of a different type. This is done by calling memleak_* functions
at the allocation point (outside allocator) where only the pointer is
known. In the vmalloc case, it would need to call find_vm_area. This
might not be a big problem, only that memory resources are no longer
treated in a unified way by kmemleak (and might not be trivial to add
support for new allocators).

A global hash would need to be re-built for every scan (and destroyed
afterwards), making this operation longer since the pointer values
together with their aliases (resulted from using container_of) are
added to the hash.
I understand the benefits but I personally favor simplicity over
performance, especially for code used as a debugging tool. DEBUG_SLAB
already introduces an overhead by poisoning the allocated blocks.
Generating the backtrace and filling in the memleak objects for every
allocation is another overhead. Global structures are indeed a
scalability problem but for a reasonable number of CPUs their overhead
might not be that big. Anyway, I can't be sure without some
benchmarking and this is probably highly dependent on the system
(caches, snoop control unit etc.).
