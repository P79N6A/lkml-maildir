I'm experiencing the exact same problem with my setup also with sata_promise.
I have posted to the linux-ide list but it wasn't really acknowledged as a
problem in the driver. Are these command timeouts? The log entry doesn't seem
to say that - just an error with 'DriveReady' and command aborted. I would
think some kind of retry should be performed (and if it is then logged too).
The errors may be benign but the problem is when using software raid (md
driver) that this error may cause a degraded array and worse a damaged array
should a read error like this occur when an array is already degraded.
The question is what happens after the error is reported, is the operation
retried? In my situation the md layer receives the error and recovers by
taking the data from another drive in the array. 
The fact that you are also experiencing this means it might be an issue that
needs further investigation in my opinion.
Regards,
Marc
