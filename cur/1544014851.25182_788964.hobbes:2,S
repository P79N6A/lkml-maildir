Fedora rawhide users noticed this same problem this morning too,
when I pushed out a build that eats up a gig of diskspace thanks
to the number of modules we have, that are all afflicted by this problem.
I'll have to revert ad7a953c for our builds to continue tracking mainline
without monopolising the diskspace in the Fedora build system.
