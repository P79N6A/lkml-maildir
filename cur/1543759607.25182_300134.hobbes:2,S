I wasn't quite correct in my report yesterday. Replacing pm2fb.c from 
2.6.11 with 2.6.10 fixes only one problem - the font becomes white again 
and penguin images get fixed. But switching from X to vt still doesn't 
work. It works under 2.6.10-rc2. The new config is based on oldconfig with 
almost all new defaults. Nothing fb-related, AFAICT. I'll try to revert 
some other files in drivers/video later today, unless someone has a better 
idea.
Thanks
