IMO a bitmap could be used.  Anyway in that case the x86-64 arch code
would need to have access either to this structure or to the image metadata,
because it must figure out which pages are not safe.  I don't see any simple
way of making this work ...

Well, you have taken these things out of context.  Namely, the userspace
process cannot freeze the other tasks, suspend devices etc., so it has to
call the kernel for these purposes anyway.  Of course if something goes
wrong it has to call the kernel to revert these steps too.  Similarly it
can call the kernel to allocate the image memory and to free it in case
something's wrong.  For example, if the userspace initiates the resume:
- if (image not found)
	exit
- sys_freeze_processes /* this one will be tricky ;-) */
- sys_create_pagedir
- while (image data) {
	sys_put_this_stuff_where_appropriate(image data);
	/* Here the kernel will do the relocation etc. if necessary */
	if (something's wrong)
		goto Cleanup; }
- sys_atomic_restore /* suspend devices, disable IRQs, restore */
Cleanup: /* certainly something's gone wrong */
- sys_destroy_pagedir /* that's it */
- sys_resume_devices
- sys_thaw_processes

In that case we'll have to redesign the snapshot part top-down anyway.
