Nice.  Gives false negatives in some cases (e.g. a local tunnel) but
that doesn't really matter.
I've considered this technique for deciding whether it's safe to use the
MIT-SHM extension with X:
Open a SHM segment; write fairly secure random data into it; ask the X
server to connect to that segment and read it back as an image over the
X protocol; check whether they match.
If the X server reports an error, it's remote.  If it finds a SHM
segment it may still be remote, hence the random data check.
