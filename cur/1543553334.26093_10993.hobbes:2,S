Do you or anyone else on the list recall why this decision was made? Can
you recall around when it was made so I can dig out the history from the
archives?
I would be eager to convert everything over to the C99 syntax, test the
heck out of it and submit the patch. Obviously this is wasted effort if
there is a good reason to continue using the gcc syntax.
