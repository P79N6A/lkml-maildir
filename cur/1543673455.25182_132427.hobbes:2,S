Right, if some process/user opens a file and then passes the descriptor
to another process/user which closes it. The close should operate under
the same permissions as the original opener.
Simple example when this happens is when a setuid application is started
and the stdout/stderr is redirected to a file. 'ping foo >out 2>&1'. The
shell opens the file under my uid, but the setuid application closes it
under the new uid.

The local user id is not a 'trusted' identity for a distributed filesystem.
Any user still have to prove his identity by obtaining tokens. 
If someone obtains my user id on in any way (i.e. weak password/
bufferoverflow/ root exploit), he should not be allowed to use or access
my tokens as he hasn't proven his identity. In this case he would either
still be in his original process authentication group, or a new and
empty PAG. But definitely not in any of my authentication groups.
Which is also why joining a PAG should never be allowed.
Any arguments about 'it avoids the cost of obtaining credentials' are
stupid because that cost is exactly what it takes to prove that a new
session is in fact associated with a specific user. If our identity
already was proven beyond reasonable doubt, we clearly already have our
'token' and the additional cost to associate this with the new PAG is
zero.
