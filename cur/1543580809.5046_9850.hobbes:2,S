I'd rather have them complain it doesn't build than never complain because they
think reiserfs is still a little too new and has bugs.  Also, I just don't think
my convenience matters as much as that of the users.  I don't want to use
#ifdefs, I want it to die explosively and verbosely informatively.  make isn't
the most natural language for that, but I am sure Yura can find a way.

We don't (at least not intentionally, surely someone is going to mention one
where we did) ignore bug reports on our mailing list.  Period.
We are capable of telling users, you know, this is user error, if you want
detailed help send me a note that you have put $25 in the mail, and I'll have
someone give you step by step help with it.  If it is easy to narrow the user
error down from the first email I typically just tell them what it is.

Please delay shipping the 3.0 CVS branch on RedHat for a while.:-)  Sorry, I
couldn't resist.
Look, everybody lets a piece of software slip out that should not have gone at
some point in their career.  It is just that RedHat is big enough that everyone
is inconvenienced when they do so, and so we need to patch a Makefile to reduce
the annoyance.  No biggie.
