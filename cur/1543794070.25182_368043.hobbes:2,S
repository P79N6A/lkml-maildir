You have an interesting definition of "great".
1- It doesn't work without an annoyingly complex, extremely badly
   documented user configuration. To the point that it doesn't work in
   either an out-of-the-box, updated Fedora Core 3 nor an
   out-of-the-box gentoo.
2- It doesn't work for programs that do not use the annoyingly complex
   and horribly documented alsa library, which includes everything
   that still uses OSS[1].
You call that great?  Multiple audio streams is such a basic feature
it should work, period.  No if, no buts, and no obligatory library.
Which doesn't preclude having it in userspace, mind you.  But it
should never have been the _application_'s responsability.
  OG.
[1] Which is so easier to use for normal programs' audio it's not
    funny.
