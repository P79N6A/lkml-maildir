Easily.  Have a look at the internals of uart_handle_break() in
include/linux/serial_core.h
However, please be aware that ^O is the default control character for
"flush output" which I think is something you may want to use with a
serial console.  Eg:
speed 38400 baud; rows 0; columns 0; line = 1;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;
eol2 = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W;
lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;
            ^^^^^^^^^^^
Hence it's a poor choice.  Maybe picking a character which isn't
already used by default for another purpose would be appropriate?
'^]', the classic telnet escape character maybe?
