Thanks for trying.  I can't think of any relevant change which can
cause this and I doubt it's something affecting many machines given
that you're currently the only one reporting this problem.
Any chance it's a hardware fluke?  Can you please make sure it doesn't
happen with 2.6.27?

Eh... I doubt that will happen.  No scheduled change for SFF HSM
implementation.
Thanks.
