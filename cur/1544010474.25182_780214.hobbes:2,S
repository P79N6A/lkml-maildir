| Hi,
| 
| Looks good and clarify the asm bits.
| 
| I wonder if the function_graph_tracer should continue to necessarily
| depend on the function tracer.
| It was more simplier to do so but perhaps that could be avoided with
| small modifications.

Hi Frédéric,
I didn't play with tracer internals since was more concerned about
asm part of code. If you find that we better should introduce
additional deps here or change a "deps graph" itself - I think it
will be easy to place a new patch on top of this (or replace my
patch) :)
The only thing I would change in mine patch is -- subq/addq $0x38, %rsp
since the following code uses decimal system but not a big deal anyway.
