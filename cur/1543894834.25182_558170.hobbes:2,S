This might be more like GPLv3, or it might not.  But it still misses
the point.
The point is to show that the egg yolk license still is about the egg
yolk license, even though its effects do limit what the egg shell
manufacturer can do with that particular egg yolk.
I.e., the GPL is still about the software, and the hardware
manufacturer can't claim "but this is the hardware!" to escape
obligations determined by its choice of the GPL software.

Very bad understanding of the intent of the argument, and failing to
answer the relevant question ;-)

*Why* did they make this decision?
