This change worries me.  It's a very bad situation if we leave dirty
pagecache sitting over a piece of the file which is about to be either read
or written via direct-IO.  As far as the application is concerned, it
pretty much guarantees impending data corruption and I do think we need to
tell the application the bad news and not just pretend that things are all
OK.
What problem are we trying to fix here?
