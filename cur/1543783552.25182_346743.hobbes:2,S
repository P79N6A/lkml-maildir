I made sure these apply to 2.6.13-mm1, just after 
	vm-add-page_state-info-to-per-node-meminfo.patch
But, they should apply anywhere after the ppc64 sparsemem extreme fixes
that went into 2.6.13-mm1.

The following series implements memory hot-add for ppc64 and i386.
There are x86_64 and ia64 implementations that will be submitted shortly
as well, through the normal maintainers.
