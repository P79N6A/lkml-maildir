*USUALY* correct.

This was not a bug report.

I didn't email either directly, because I doubt either has time to work 
on this, since default behavior is seen as "correct", and if they do, 
they will most likely notice this thread and read my message, or 
someone else will point it out to them that better knows if it's a pure 
waste of their time or not.
As for the VM battle threads, I read most of them as they were 
happening, and I really don't give a shit about them.
