Interesting .. I have a network of optiplexes also (GX1's), same
configuration ... I also have a poweredge 6100, and 2 6300's (6100 and one
6300 have the intel eepro 100, and the other 6300 has a dual eepro100), but
currently using kernel 2.2.10 (stock).. Also running on a 100mbit network..
I haven't experienced any problems with nfs between any of the systems, and
I just looked through the syslogs on each of the machines and didn't see any
messages like that .. (all the systems are running Debian, but that
shouldn't matter .. again though, I'm using kernel version 2.2.10.. but I
don't remember any problems back when I was running 2.2.5)
Did you try a newer kernel ?
