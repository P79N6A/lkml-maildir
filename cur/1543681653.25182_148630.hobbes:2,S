In fact I've seen a number of apps display this problem. Basically how I 
understood it was the child was spawned with a lower dynamic priority (50% of 
the bonus of the parent with the child penalty at 50%). The parent then was 
spinning madly waiting for the child but in the process it was continually 
preempting the child. Eventually the parent was seen as a cpu hog, it's 
dynamic priority dropped and the child finally got to run along side it. The 
next time you ran the same parent/child combination the problem had gone 
because the parent was at a lower dynamic priority. Changing child penalty 
back up to 95% cures this problem (but can bring other problems with it 
unless workarounds are added). While this seems more an anomaly in the coding 
of the application brought out by the scheduler, it seems to be very common.
