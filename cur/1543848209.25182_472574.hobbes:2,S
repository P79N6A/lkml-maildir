Subject: [GFS2] Fix a size calculation error
Fix a size calculation error.
The size was incorrect being computed as a
negative length and then being passed to an
unsigned parameter.
This in turn would cause the allocator to
think it needed enough meta data to store
a gigabyte file for every file created.
