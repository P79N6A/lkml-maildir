Hi all,
I have a T21 thinkpad Pentium III 800 MHz.
I have red hat 8.0 installed with kernel 2.4.18.
Executing cat /proc/cpuinfo I noticed that cpu speed is 212.51 MHz.
Looking at BIOS the speed is correct.
Any idea?
PS
Why am I continuosly unsubscribed from the kernel list?
Please cc me in the answer, currently I am not subscibed to the list (I 
posted few minutes ago a new mail to majordomo).
