Subject: [PATCH] fix for autofs4 stomping on autofs v3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
There was a problem where the autofs v3 kernel code was using the same
AUTOFS_PROTO_VERSION as the v4 code, which confused autofs v3 user-mode code.
The basic problem is that linux/auto_fs.h doesn't describe just one interface
version, but several (two in this case).  Similarly, the user-mode code doesn't
talk "the" protocol version its header file happens to have in it, but the
particular version it implements (ie, its independent of the header file it
includes).
The quick fix is to rearrange the #defines so that everything gets the info it
needs.  The better fix is to make the protocol version a particular party is
talking distinct from the particular header file it includes.
The patch below is the quick fix, and is not too far off the proper fix (except
I didn't want to modify the original autofs source at all).

+Kernel automounter v4 support
+CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS
+  The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote filesystems
+  on demand. This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce
+  overhead in the already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD
+  automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.
+
+  To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from
+  
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/testing-v4
 ; you also
+  want to answer Y to "NFS filesystem support", below.
+
+  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
+  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be
+  called autofs4.o.  You will need to add "alias autofs autofs4" to
+  your modules configuration file.
+
+  If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network or don't
+  have a laptop which needs to dynamically reconfigure to the local
+  network, you probably do not need an automounter, and can say N here.
