If that's so (I don't trust my judgement on matters of speculative
execution), then I think you'd do better to replace the *ptep = __pte(0)
by pte_clear(mm, addr, ptep), and so avoid your ugly #ifdef'ing: please
check, but I think you'll find that reduces to just the barrier you want.
CC'ed Zach since it's his optimization, and he'll judge that spexecution.
