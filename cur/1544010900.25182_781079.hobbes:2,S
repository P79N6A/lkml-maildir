Light dawns. Perhaps you think "jiffies" is a meaningless word that
happens to be the name of a variable that measures elapsed time.
It's not. "jiffy" is a "short moment of time" in english, and "jiffies"
is its plural. Like "augenblick" in german, but a bit longer
("augenblick" probably translates as "moment", or "instant", literally,
"eyeblink").  "In a jiffy" is an english phrase meaning "soon!".  It's
close to an "instant" but of vaguer extent.
So the variable called "jiffies" measures the number of elapsed
jiffies.
Like a variable called "hours" that measures the number of elapsed
hours.
"foo jiffies" is no stranger than "foo hours" or "foo minutes" or "foo
seconds". That's why I was puzzled that you queried it!

See it now? 
Imagine that you had a macro called
   time_is_after_hours
then 
  time_is_after_hours(12)
would mean to an english speaker
  the current time is later than midday
I.e.
  the current time is later than 12h
               |    |   |        .|'
              time_is_after_hours(12)
Unfortunately the kernel's "time_is_after_hours(12)" macro means
mathematically what we would express in english as "the current time is
BEFORE 12h".  Ouch.
The kernel's 
     time_is_after_jiffies(500)
macro mathematically means
    the current value of the jiffies variable is LESS THAN 500
!! That's the other way round from the way that an english speaker
would read the macro name as meaning! So the semantics and the name
contradict each other.
Clear now?
