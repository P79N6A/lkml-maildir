Nope that wont work.
1. We need to support other states of pages other than zeroed.
2. Prezeroing does not make much sense if a large portion of the
   page is being used. Performance is better if the whole page 
   is zeroed directly before use.Prezeroing only makes sense for sparse
   allocations like the page table pages.

I already tried that 3 years ago and there was *no* benefit for usual
users of the a page allocator. The advantage exists only if a small
portion of the page is used. F.e. For one cacheline there was a 4x 
improvement. See lkml archives for prezeroing.
