If you have legacy app, how it comes that it uses mmap? And if I do
not use mmap, I have nothing at 1GB:
void main() { sleep(10); brk((void*)0xBF000000); pause(); }
/proc/`pidof x`/maps says during sleep(10):
08048000-080a1000 r-xp 00000000 03:03 230941   /usr/src/linus/x
080a1000-080a5000 rw-p 00058000 03:03 230941   /usr/src/linus/x
080a5000-080a6000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
and after brk() (which suceeded after I did ulimit -d unlimited
and 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory') I see:
08048000-080a1000 r-xp 00000000 03:03 230941   /usr/src/linus/x
080a1000-080a5000 rw-p 00058000 03:03 230941   /usr/src/linus/x
080a5000-bf000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
So maybe MAGMA uses some API which it should not use under any
circumstances... Such as that you linked it with libc6 stdio.
