You driver first needs to call blk_queue_ordered() to set ordered mode
(probably QUEUE_ORDERED_DRAIN_FLUSH) and the filesystem needs to be
mounted with barrier enabled as Neil explained.  Then, the FS will issue
barriers and the block layer will interpret them as draining + cache flush.

I thought about re-implementing it in terms of barrier callbacks but
wasn't sure whether it would be better than completely removing
blkdev_issue_flush() && a bit lazy. :-)
I'll look into it.

Yeap, basically a block driver needs two callbacks - issue_flush and
prepare_flush plus a call to blk_queue_ordered().

Received, acked && forwarded to Jens.
Thanks.
