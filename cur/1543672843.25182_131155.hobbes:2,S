	Hello All ,  I am having a difficulty with the dpt_120 driver &
	the sym2-53c8xx driver .  I have just placed a Adaptec 2010s raid
	controller in my system & it now wants to take device 0800 away
	from the sym2 driver at boot time .  ALL drivers are statically
	built into the kernel .  Is there a way at either of the methods
	stated in the subjec to get the order back so that I have my real
	root file system back on 0800 ?  Tia ,  JimL
