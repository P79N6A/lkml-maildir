then please provide a kernel config option for the new driver to take 
over 10:135 too. There's nothing worse to the adoption of new kernel 
features necessiating user-space attention. I've got several images of 
old distros that i dont want to reconfigure in any way, and it would be 
nice to have a drop-in /dev/rtc replacement for them. Really. This is 
how we do it for just about everything else too.
