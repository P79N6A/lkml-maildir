Subject: negative timeout can be set up by setsockopt system call

I observed that the the setsockopt system call can  setup negative 
timeout. As a matter of fact the function sock_set_timeout checks for 
zero timeout but does not check for negative timeouts. I tested this 
against 2.6.14  kernel but it is so in all previous release also. So I 
am wondering if it is a bug or there is some reason for keeping it that 
way which I am missing.
