I tried that with 2.5.64-bk5 and it didn't help.  Still hung at the same 
place.  This was with CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC unset which got rid of the following
  CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC
  CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC
  CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
  CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC
: Could you try the same config without APIC and IO APIC for Uniprocessor
: ?
: I've a problem that is directly related to 2.5.64 and these features...
: 
: Without them, 2.5.64 just boots fine...
