Hi there,
on my Elan410 based System it is very easy to change the CPU clock speed by
means od two outb commands.
I was wondering, if it does some harm to the Kernel if the CPU is
reprogrammed using a different CPU clock speed, while the system is up and
running.
If so, is there a possibility to tell the Kernel that the clock speed has
been changed by means of a particular Kernel call?
If not, where would I put some code to do this at system boot?
Is /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S the right place for something like
this?
Thanks for hints
Sven
