IIRC, because of the way the loopback delivers packets from the
same context as they are sent, it is possible (and quite easy)
to either deadlock or peg the CPU and make everything hang and
be unuseable.  DRBD likewise used to have problems with testing
over the loopback until they added a special configuration
option to be extra careful and yield CPU.
