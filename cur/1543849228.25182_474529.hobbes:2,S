Yes. My preferred alternative way is used by 
all the rest of Documentation already.
My other preferred alternative way, used by
many programs like apache, postgresql, mysql,
samba etc. is html, which could be read even 
on consoles with lynx or links. 
If there is a problem of space let it be
accessible in ftp subdirectory at least.
