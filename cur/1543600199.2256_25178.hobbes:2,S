Hum.  Yes.  We need a way to distinguish between userspace and
kernelspace icache flushes.
Previously, flush_icache_page was used exclusively for userspace
and flush_icache_range exclusively for kernelspace.  Since I _do_
have address space numbers, I can avoid the "flush all" by allocating
a new ASN for the user process.  Which doesn't work for the kernel
of course; there I do have to flush all.
