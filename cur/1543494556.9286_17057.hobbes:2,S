FreeBSD has macros like you describe for defining
init functions and calling order, so it is doable.
The macro creates entries in a global init table that is processed during
boot.
The thing I like this approach is that it keeps the definition in the
same source file as the implementation,. allowing you to add
a kernel function (device or otherwise) without necessarily
having to modify init/main.c.
On the other hand, it could be argued that explicitly adding
the init function call to init/main.c makes it easier to know what
is called and in what order. With the macro, you would have to
grep for all instances of the macro in all the kernel files and then
piece together the load order based on the macro arguments.
(or look at compiler listing files)
