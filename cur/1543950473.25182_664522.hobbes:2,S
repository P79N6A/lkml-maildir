Hi, i got a new kohjinsha laptop with winbond wifi card and I'm 
struggling to get it work...
I found a driver which seems to work somehow, but the driver is pretty 
buggy...
it causes kernel panic (when modprobing with wifi switched on) pretty 
often... (when modprobing with wifi switched off, the card does not work)
however if modprobing succeeds (about 10% times), the driver works 
pretty well...
the driver seems to be GPL, but the license version is unclear...
you can find some more info on my kohjinsha page:
