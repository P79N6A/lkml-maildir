Please create explicit function calls for each operation, this
way the caller is immune to open-firmware implementation details.

Sparc 32-bit predates the OFW specification and does things differently.
Please use a functional interface using a C function for each device
tree operation, then the implementation behind it doesn't matter.

Yet we still support them in the 32-bit sparc port.  And it's so
easy to support this properly, please use the clean stuff we've
created for this.

Since we put it in memory, we have zero reason to call into the
firmware for device tree access and this simplifies things a lot.
But all of that really doesn't matter, if you use a functional
C interface for each device tree access operation, it doesn't
matter what's behind it right?
