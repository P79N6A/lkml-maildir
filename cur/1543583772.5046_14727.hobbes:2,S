I _DO_ know what db1 stands for. And we do _NOT_ have db1 in our
distribution, KSI Linux. And we are _NOT_ going to build the obsolete
library with all the accompanied development stuff just to be able to make
some tool required to build exactly ONE kernel driver. It was a nightmare to
get rid of TREE incompatible libdbs so it doesn't make any sence to get that
mess back in. It's just plain braindead to do something like this. Occam was
right and this is plain stupid.
