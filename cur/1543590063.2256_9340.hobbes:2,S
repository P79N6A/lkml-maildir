2.4.4 has some problems with fork() but your problem seems to be
something else.  Are you using RedHat 7.1?  (Or whatever it was
the latest...)  The su-acting-weird problem has been reported 
before and was traced to some PAM problems.  Try to download
some upgrades from RedHat, maybe it will help.
