I guess it's time to get back to this problem.
I don't want to make PNP insert resources only at the root.  That
would avoid the ALSA problem because the enclosing PCI resource is
allocated first, but it also precludes us from dealing with lots of
valid ACPI information.  ACPI can describe layers of bridges and
devices behind them.  It don't think we should throw away that
information just to solve this problem.
And I don't really want to add IORESOURCE_INSERT.  It's probably a
useful idea, but I don't think it helps solve *this* problem.  We'd
have to mark both the PCI and the PNP regions as "insert", and I
think we'd end up with the exact same situation we have today:
  febf8000-febfbfff : 0000:00:1b.0 -- from pcibios_resource_survey (!busy)
  febfa000-febfac00 : pnp 00:08    -- from PNP system driver (!busy)
  febf8000-febfbfff : ICH HD audio -- fails; spans part of PNP region
I'm back to the quirk idea, which is still ugly but seems the most
straightforward to me.  Here's my current patch (this won't apply
directly because we'd have to revert the Supermicro-specific quirk
first).
Excuse me a minute while I put on my asbestos underwear.

PNP: disable PNP motherboard resources that overlap PCI BARs
Some BIOSes have PNP motherboard devices with resources that
partially overlap PCI BARs.  The PNP system driver claims these
motherboard resources, which prevents the normal PCI driver from
requesting them later.
This patch disables the PNP resources that conflict with PCI BARs
so they won't be claimed by the PNP system driver.
Of course, this only works if PCI devices have already been enumerated.
Currently, PCI devices are discovered before any PNP init via this path:
    acpi_pci_root_init() -> acpi_pci_root_add() -> pci_acpi_scan_root() ->
	pci_scan_bus_parented() -> pci_scan_child_bus() -> ...
