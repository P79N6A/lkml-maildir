I have had a very high level look at Satoshi's patch. I will go into 
details soon. I was thinking that this patch solves the problem only
for CFQ. Can we create a common layer which can be shared by all
the four IO schedulers.
So this one common layer can take care of all the management w.r.t
per device per cgroup data structures and track all the groups, their
limits (either token based or time based scheme), and control the
dispatch of requests.
This way we can enable IO controller not only for CFQ but for all the
IO schedulers without duplicating too much of code.
This is what I am playing around with currently. At this point I am
not sure, how much of common ground I can have between all the IO
schedulers.

Can you just elaborate a little on how do you get around idleness problem?
If you don't create idleness than if two tasks in two cgroups are doing
sequential IO, they might simply get into lockstep and we will not achieve
any differentiated service proportionate to their weight.

This is a good idea. Charging the cgroup based on time actually consumed
should be doable. I will look into it. I think in the past somebody
mentioned that how do you account for the seek time taken because of 
switchover between cgroups? May be average time per cgroup can help here
a bit.
This is more about refining the dispatch algorightm once we have agreed
upon other semantics like 2 level scheduler and can we come up with a common
layer which can be shared by all four IO schedulers. Once common layer is
possible, we can always change the common layer algorithm from token based
to time based to achive better accuracy.
