We still have a regression from 2.6.15 in the megaraid_sas driver.
We started sending down all requests as scatter/gather lists after 2.6.15,
and the (broken) way megaraid_sas tried to hide the physical disks ceased
to work.  Now the driver shows all physical disks which confuses installers
to no end and could trick people to write to it which would corrupt controller
internal state badly.
To fix this properly the scsi midlayer needs to handle the ->slave_configure
return value.  The patch for that is pretty trivially, but could in theory
cause problems if an existing driver returns something bogus from
->slave_configure.   Both the core patch and the actual megaraid_sas fix
are in James' scsi-rc-fixes tree, so if you pull that once more we should
be done with this.
