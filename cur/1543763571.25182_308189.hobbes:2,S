    That's a really old kernel, and I'm sure anyone who could look
into this will ask you to upgrade to something recent and reproduce it
as the first step in tracking it down.
    Is this an older box?  I've seen the hangcheck warnings on a
486 I was using as a firewall/router -- ultimately I applied a patch
to set HZ to 100 and the problem went away.  I *think*, once that patch
bitrotted, that I just turned off the hangcheck timer, but I can't
remember for sure.
   If you turn off the hangcheck timer, does the problem go away
(i.e. no more lockups)?
