Comparing[1] week 51 (2.4.23-rc5), and week 01 (2.4.23-aa1) would show that the
slab cache can grow larger for the same workload in -aa right now.
I have a backup that runs every day at 4-6am that is somewhat memory
intensive since it uses smbfs, (that's notorious for its bad memory usage
patterns) and it doesn't shrink the slab at all.  The only thing that
affected slab size was closing one of my mutt instances that was running on
a maildir folder with 28k messages in it on tuesday of week 01.

2.4.23-aa may or may not have problems with inode/dentry reclaim (I haven't
checked other workloads), but it sure improves the amount of swap I/O
performed.
Here's the top slab users right now:
