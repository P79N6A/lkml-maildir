At which point he'll piss of more and more kernel developers and lose them
"slowly" as well, unless Linus himself gets pissed at which point the kernel
user base will disappear in a single glitch.  Breaking SCCS compatibility
"slowly" without anybody noticing before it's too late is a bit far fetched
IMHO.
