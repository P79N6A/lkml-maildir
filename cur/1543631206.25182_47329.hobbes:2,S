Hi
atapi.c is not a module, then it don't make sense to have a
MODULE_LICENSE :(
Notice that I don't like that kind of trap:
disable IDECD
compile kernel
enable IDECD as module
compile module
your module don't work :(
And we have had already that problem with NFS, please, make that file
_always_ compiled in, or make it a real module.
Later, Juan.
