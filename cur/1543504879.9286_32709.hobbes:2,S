It CAN be done, of course, but you'll need to modify kernel (or write special
program with "raw keyboard mode" usage -- of course it'll work if you do not
need SysRq stuff).

No. /dev/tty is just "current tty" (for process). It can be used with
/dev/ttyS0, for example.

Not just that. You must modify console to interact with your serial driver :-)
There are NO thing like "keyboard" or "video" in userspace. All comunication
is inside kernel. So you should change it in kernel...
