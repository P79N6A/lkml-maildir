Hi everybody,
	I have a question for you; How Linux avoids the memory fragmentation in
linked lists?
	Windows 9x/NT/2000 (sorry, ;-)), have specific functions (like List_Create,
ExInitializeSListHead, ...) to create generic linked lists but I don't find
something similar in Linux.
	Has Linux a generic linked list management API ?
	Must I develop this?
	Is the kernel memory fragmentation a solved problem in Linux? (I wish it).
	I have develop my own API but I don't know if Linux can do this for me.
Thanks in advance.
