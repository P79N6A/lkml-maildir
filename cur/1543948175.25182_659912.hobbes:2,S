fdatasync() is required to write data pages _and_ the necessary
metadata to reference those changed pages (btrfs tree etc.), but not
non-data metadata.
It's the filesystem's responsibility to interpret that correctly.
In-place writes don't need anything else.  Phase-tree style writes do.
Some kinds of logged writes don't.
I'm under the impression that sync_file_range() is a sort of
restricted-range asynchronous fdatasync().
By limiting the range of file date which must be written out, it
becomes more refined for database and filesystem-in-a-file type
applications.  Just as fsync() is more refined than sync() - it's
useful to sync less - same goes for syncing just part of a file.
It's still the filesystem's responsibility to sync data access
metadata appropriately.  It can sync more if it wants, but not less.
That's what I understand by
   sync_file_range(fd, start,length, SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE_BEFORE
                   | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE
                   | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE_AFTER);
Largely because the manual says to use that combination of flags for
an equivalent to fdatasync().
The concept of "write-out" is not defined in the manual.  I'm assuming
it to mean this, as a reasonable guess:
SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE scans all pages in the range, looking for dirty
pages which aren't already queued for write-out.  It marks those with
a "write-out" flag, and starts write I/Os at some unspecified time in
the near future; it can be assumed writes for all the pages will
complete eventually if there's no errors.  When I/O completes on a
page, it cleans the page and also clears the write-out flag.
SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER waits until all pages in the range don't
have the "write-out" flag set.
SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE does the same wait, but before marking
pages for write-out.  I don't actually see the point in this.  Isn't a
preceding call with SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER equivalent, making
BEFORE a redundant flag?
The manual says it is something to do with data-integrity, but it's
not clear to me what that means.
All this implies that "write-out" flag is a concept userspace can rely
on.  That's not so peculiar: WRITE seems to be equivalent to AIO-style
fdatasync() on a limited range of offsets, and WAIT_AFTER seems to be
equivalent to waiting for any previously issued such ops to complete.
Any data access metadata updates that btrfs must make for fdatasync(),
it must also make for sync_file_range(), for the limited range of
offsets.
