I don't see any sense in adding that.  Using /proc/pid/mem is already the
"efficient" API for this known to userland.  I don't think keeping the fd
around for that is any great burden, and if you do then the one pread64
call is just as efficient as one ptrace call to do the same thing.
Thanks,
Roland
