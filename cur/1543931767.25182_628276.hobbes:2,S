Well, you're wrong. Sorry, but that's just the way it is. See below.

*AGAIN*, please read your message here, in particular item number
seven on Larry's list:
https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/bcm43xx-dev/2007-December/006472.html
For the last fscking time, if rfkill and rfkill-input are not loaded,
not one line comes out in dmesg when b43 and ssb are loaded. In
particular, your pretty little message about needing newer firmware
also does not print. So, yeah, not loading rfkill{,-input} *does*
cause issues with b43 working, as there's no damn way to find out
what's broken!

I'm not asking you to do that, this particular bug will be fixed by
Larry's patch, whether you believe that or not.

The kernel does not exist in a vacuum. It's the kernel's job to make
sure it works with properly written userspace. Broken userspace, sure,
then we can talk about breaking it.

Oy vay. I'm not an idiot. Yes, it's the current develoment version.
But tracking the latest kernel.org kernel has in the past required the
latest develoment version of the distribution, so I upgrade it as
well.

I'm not blaming it on you. I'm merely reporting a fucking
incompatibility. Read my messages again from the top, and stop taking
this all so damn personally, will you?
