1) the scheduler in 2.5.2-pre3 does it in a different way because the
	dynamic priority is split from the time slice.
2) the current scheduler does not permit you doing such a thing in a smart
	way so, if i've to choose i prefer an implementation that solves
	real world cases. i challenge you to measure the counter tick loss
	during the yield() call anyway. it's very easy indeed to measure
	the current behavior, like we're currently seeing
