We're still allocating interrupts to a bunch 'o stuff that isn't actually
being used ... I'd prefer it if we could change that, and allocate them
as they're actually used, rather than (what I believe is) still a fixed
number per IO-APIC. Is there some smart way to do that?
If not, the overflow protection is still (obviously) a good thing to do.
