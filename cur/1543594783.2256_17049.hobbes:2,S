Yes, this doesn't make sense for flash, and in fact, it doesn't make sense to 
have just one set of bdflush parameters for the whole system, it's really a 
property of the individual device.  So the thing to do is for me to go kibitz 
on the io layer rewrite projects and figure out how to set up the 
intelligence per-queue, and have the queues per-device, at which point it's 
trivial to do the write^H^H^H^H^H right thing for each kind of device.
BTW, with nominal 100,000 erases you have to write 10 terabytes to your 100 
meg flash disk before you'll see it start to degrade.  These devices are set 
up to avoid continuous hammering on the same same page, and to take failed 
pages out of the pool as soon as they fail to erase.  Also, the 100,000 
figure is nominal - the average number of erases you'll get per page is 
considerably higher.  The extra few sectors we see with the early flush patch 
are just not going to affect the life of your flash to a measurable degree.
