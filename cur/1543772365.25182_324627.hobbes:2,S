Sorry, it was -s 10000 and -p 10000, I copy-pasted the wrong history line.
I also have verified that 2.4.30 behaves the same way with the netcat test.
So the difference between old and new versions should be that new versions
are able to allocate a source port for connect() eventhough this one should
be marked as used because of the bind(). This does not seem critical at all
anyway.
