A couple points to followup on the notion of VM at mem=4m:
2.4.18pre2aa2 can do it:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101123070310781&w=2
2.5.2, 2.4.18-pre4, and 2.4.18-pre3-rmap11b would not allow login 
with boot single mem=4m:
2.4.18-pre3-rmap11b tried with init=/bin/bash and init=/bin/ash,
but that would not produce a prompt either.

BTW, I think 4G is more important than 4M.
