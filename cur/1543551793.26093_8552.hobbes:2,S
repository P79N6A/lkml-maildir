The page count is (or should be) sufficient, and if it weren't sufficient
that would be a bug in the swap-out handling of anonymous or shm memory. I
refuse to see page locking or similar for this kind of pinning (counts are
recursive and re-entrant, a "lock bit" is not).
Anonymous pages that get swapped out use the page cache too, so it's all
safe (it's _not_ safe in 2.0.x or possibly even 2.2.x for shm, but 2.4.x
should be ok - if it's not we need to fix it in the shm_swap function, not
in the kiobuf code).
