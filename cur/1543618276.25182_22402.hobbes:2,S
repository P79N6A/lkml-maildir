yes ... maybee ... the problem is , that the disconnect-function  is
enabled by the chipset ... and it is a different register in every
different chipset. so it is a little bit difficult to make a solution for
all chipsets.
by the way ... i know www.vcool.de ... my work is partialy based on this.
but the vcool linux patch/version does not support kt266/kt266a chipset.
(only the kt/kx133 chipset)
after some mail exchange with the developer of vcool, i decided to wrote a
kernelpatch, which supports the kt266/kt266a chipset too. (one of my
reasosns for this was, that the developer of vcool will not develop the
linux version further) .
the second thing is, that this patch is a little bit simpler then the
(l)vcool approach ... i think ... :)
ah ... if someone sends me the the needed informations, which registers
(or register-bits) are to be changed on ther chipsets to activate the
disconnect-function, i will add this chipsets to the patch.
