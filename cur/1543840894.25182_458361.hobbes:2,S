Yes.

added
#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT

then

from sched.h:
static inline void put_task_struct(struct task_struct *t)
{
        if (atomic_dec_and_test(&t->usage))
                __put_task_struct(t);
}
but is it used?
[rcrocomb@spanky test_2.6.17-rt8]$ find ./ -name \*.c -print0 | xargs
-0 grep -l "put_task_struct(" | wc -l
30
Yes it is.   Also, beginning at line 292 in what I call t6.diff (the
most recent URL, I believe):
+#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
.
.
.
+
+/*
+ * We dont want to do complex work from the scheduler with preemption
+ * disabled, therefore we delay the work to a per-CPU worker thread.
+ */
+void fastcall __put_task_struct(struct task_struct *task)
+{
+       struct list_head *head;
+
+       head = &get_cpu_var(delayed_put_task_struct_list);
+       list_add_tail(&task->delayed_drop, head);
+
+       _wake_cpu_desched_task();
+
+       put_cpu_var(delayed_put_task_struct_list);
+}
+#endif
+
So I think you're mistaken.  Patch is applied like this:
[rcrocomb@spanky test_2.6.17-rt8]$ patch -p0 < ../patches/t6.diff

patching file arch/x86_64/mm/numa.c
patching file fs/jbd/journal.c
patching file include/linux/hardirq.h
patching file include/linux/init_task.h
patching file include/linux/sched.h
patching file include/linux/seqlock.h
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1 with fuzz 1.
patching file kernel/exit.c
patching file kernel/fork.c
patching file kernel/panic.c
patching file kernel/printk.c
patching file kernel/rtmutex.c
patching file kernel/sched.c
Note that I've posted the sysrq stuff at:

Sorry about screwing up your name: I turned 'hui' into your last name somehow.
