Hi,
   Andre, your ide.2.2.15-10.20000226.patch is buggy.
I did my tests with CONFIG_PCI=n. I (and some other people) observe that
it is not possible to register more than a single hwif ("ports already in
use")...
I found, that you attempt to {check,request}_region (in ide-probe.c) for
hwif->io_ports[IDE_IRQ_OFFSET], which is not initialised in
ide_init_hwif_ports() ... It contains same (probably random) data for all
hwifs.
Is it really an I/O port ?
I do not send a fix as I do not know whether it should be initialized (to 0)
or not registered as I/O region...
Regards
   Andrzej
