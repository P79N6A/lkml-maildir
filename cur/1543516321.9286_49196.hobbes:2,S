Looking at 2.3.28 I see
-#if 0
                        drive->present = 1;
-#endif
in 2.3.28.
That is incorrect.
We want to head towards the situation where the BIOS
information is not used at all. This is a step in the
wrong direction. Indeed, this drive->present = 1;
happens when the BIOS has detected some disk. However,
this need not be an IDE disk, and if it is an IDE disk
it need not be the one described by "drive".
Thus, this assignment leads to errors.
Since a disk need not be mentioned in the CMOS at all,
and since this mechanism of peeking into CMOS only
works for the first two disks, while all disks must
be recognized anyway, it follows that we do not need
this assignment.
Please revert this change to linux/drivers/block/ide-geometry.c
(line 68).
