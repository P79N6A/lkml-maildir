> When the line discipline is set via ioctl from  user space to e.g. N_PPP and the userspace program returns without resetting  the line discipline back to N_TTY, the serial device cannot be used (ENODV) until an appropriate  ioctl (to N_TTY) is performed. Is there any reason for the fact that the line discipline is not reset by the kernel , when closing the device. 
No special reason, it has simply always been that way. Getty and friends
are expected to put the tty back into a sane state.
