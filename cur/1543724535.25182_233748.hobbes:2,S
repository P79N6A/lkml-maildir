No, the interprocess communication does not; it's local sockets. I think
Alan (Robertson) even has a paper on this. It's really quite well
engineered, with a non-blocking poll() implementation based on signals
and stuff. Oh well.

True enough, but I'm somewhat unhappy with this still. So whenever we
have something like that we need to move it into the kernel space?
(pvmove first, and now the clustering etc.) Can't we come up with a way
to export this flag to user-space?
