Thanks for pointing this (great doc!), I've never had problem with disk.
Before starting to understood about those difference I expect to find 
such information on linux/Documentation/ide.txt ;)
As I say this a "Nonproblem", it's only _cosmetics_ that hurt me a bit
Linux used to be transparent ...

Ok, so linux ( latest version of course ) can fdisk any "fresh disks"
connect to secondary IDE _without_ problem.
Ok two questions came up now ( as I say on my first mail ) :
Why query the bios if Linux uses "ATA IDENTIFY request" ?
What do you think about proposed "nocmosgeom" ?
Another questions that remove the previous two:
Why hda,hdb Bios setting have priority ( aka showed ) over
"ATA IDENTIFY request" ?
Many thanks, 
luca
