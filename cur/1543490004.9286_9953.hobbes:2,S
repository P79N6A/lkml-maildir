Subject: ioport conflict with "dma page reg" (0x80)

I have a single-board computer with a hardware watchdog which uses I/O
addresses 0x80, 0x443, and 0x444.  
The problem is that something else in the system is writing to 0x80,
which resets/disables the watchdog.  
I notice that the kernel reserves 0x80-0x9F for "dma page reg" (see
/proc/ioports), but I can't find anywhere in the source that 0x80 is
actually written to explicitly.
I need to find who's stomping on 0x80 and a way to map it somewhere
else.
