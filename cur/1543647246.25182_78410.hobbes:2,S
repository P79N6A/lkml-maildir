Subject: [PATCH] 2.5 version of device mapper submission
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/9/222

The 2.5 port of device-mapper is available from:
   bk://device-mapper.bkbits.net/2.5-stable
There are 6 changesets in here that are summarised at the end of this
email.
If you wish to use it you will need to install libdevmapper:
   
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/device-mapper-latest.tgz
and then either use dmsetup, or the LVM tools:
   
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/tools/LVM2.0-latest.tgz
Initial testing has been successful, though it hasn't been exercised
nearly as much as the stable 2.4 releases.
There is a chunk of ~50 lines in dm.c, which I have clearly labelled,
this is stop gap block splitting code that will be replaced with the
correct use of queue->merge_bvec_fn etc.  However before I can make
this change there are a couple of other patches to the block layer
that I want to merge.
Since the feature freeze is looming I would appreciate it if this code
was merged now.  Allowing me to patch/argue to get the extra
performance at my leisure.  Good plan ?

  [mempool]
  Most people use mempools in conjunction with slabs, this defines 
  a couple of utility functions for allocing/freeing.

  [vmalloc]
  Introduce vcalloc, I only really want it to automate the size overflow
  check when allocating arrays.

  Provide a traditional ioctl based interface to control device-mapper
