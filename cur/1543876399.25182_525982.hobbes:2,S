oops - indeed! I've uploaded -rc5-rt7 with the fix. (it includes a few 
other fixes as well)
note that for Fedora-ish distros there's an easy yum test-kernel 
available from the rt-testing repo:
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/rt-testing.repo
[rt-testing]
name=Ingo's Real-Time (-rt) test-kernel for FC6
baseurl=
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/yum-testing/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
<Ctrl-D>
this includes Linus-git-bleeding-edge as well as the base kernel. (rt7 
is based on upstream HEAD 755948cfca16c7)
[the rt-testing repo currently includes the rt6 rpm, i've just started 
the rt7 build, it should be available in half an hour or so]
