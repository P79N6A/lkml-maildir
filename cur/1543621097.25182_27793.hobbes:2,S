After install of FreeS/WAN 1.95 ( IPSec )   ( make menugo ) , when I try to
select Networking Options from menuconfig, the following screen apears...
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:

Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
