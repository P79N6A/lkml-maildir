To clarify this a bit, the above code invokes itself with the timer and
thus runs under the timer interrupt.  The first call to it would be made
from your driver which would then sleep waiting for the wake_up, which
will come either on success or when the timer_count has expired.  This
code will poll each jiffie.
The key here is to use the wake_up/ sleep combination to pass control
from the interrupt back to the driver.  This is not unlike what you must
already be doing for interrupt completion.
Do pay attention to getting the timer (&t->timer above) properly set up
(see my first response or most any usage in the kernel).
Have I got this right Alan?
