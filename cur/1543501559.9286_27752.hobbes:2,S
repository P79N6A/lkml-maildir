ARGH, another panic...
this is different from previous one:
Jul  2 22:32:52 new kernel: Kernel panic: Free list corrupted 
and on the console I see also about 10 rows like:
dst cache overflow
Any clues?
Could It be the room temperature? HW faults? I'am puzled.
I tryed to remove quota support to see if it's related. If this isn't
enough I'll try to remove SMP.
Ciao,
Davide
