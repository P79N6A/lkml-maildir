The word "Huh?" comes to mind, for some reason.
It's just as easy to pass crap via ioctl() as write(). Regardless, I'm
not the Arbiter Of Taste on this topic. I'm merely following what I
believe to be the prevailing (<cough>Linus</cough>) sentiments are
regarding ioctl()s.
Well, that, and I personally find write(fd, &x, sizeof x) a cleaner
interface. My personal preference is of little importance on this topic,
however.
