The line length in characters was getting too long, the logic was
getting too convoluted, and the comment only applied to an unobvious
portion of the line.
Providing a name for the logical condition that a complicated
expression computes is one of the ways I find useful to make
code easier to read, and to resolve problems such as those above.
My primary goal in writing code is to minimize the time and effort
it will take a typical reader to properly understand the code.
I write first and foremost for humans.
