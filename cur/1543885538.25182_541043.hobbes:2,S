My understanding is that glibc will handle zero-filling of files for
filesystems that do not support fallocate().

I _think_ this is to convince glibc to do the zero-filling in userspace,
but I'm not up on the API specifics.

Good question.
The uninitialized extent can cover up to 128MB with a single entry.
If @path isn't specified, then ext4_ext_calc_credits_for_insert()
function returns the maximum number of extents needed to insert a leaf,
including splitting all of the index blocks.  That would allow up to 43GB
(340 extents/block * 128MB) to be preallocated, but it still needs to take
the size of the preallocation into account (adding 3 blocks per 43GB - a
leaf block, a bitmap block and a group descriptor).
Also, since @path is not being given then truncate_mutex is not needed.

Ouch, not very friendly error handling.
