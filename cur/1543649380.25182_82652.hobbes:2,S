No, but rcu_process_callbacks() is for the copy update part.
Look at rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock()... those are the read
paths.
Of course, I can be very wrong about some of this, RCU grosses^Wconfuses
me.  But the read paths do just seem to call rcu_read_lock/unlock which
just do a preempt_disable/enable.  Otherwise the read path is entirely
transparent.
