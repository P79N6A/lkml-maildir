What if demon just CAN NOT get information about device appering ?
*I* know that I just inserted new zip drive and now there are few new
devices (partitions -- not all zip drives use xxx4 even if it's default :-).
Kernel knows nothing, daemon knows nothing. With devfs I just need to try
mount and devfs will try to lead appropriate driver. With your "good way" I
need to issue additional command to (re)load driver -- why such complexity is
needed ?
P.S. It's the same as kerneld/kmod: it's not really needed -- you can load
module by hand when needed. But it's convenient to have them autoloaded when
needed. The same with devfs: driver is loaded ONLY when I try to use device.
It's CAN NOT be done without virtual filesystem.
