	Hi,
These are the remaining patches of the new PS3 storage drivers series:
  [1] ps3: Disk Storage Driver
  [2] ps3: BD/DVD/CD-ROM Storage Driver
  [3] ps3: FLASH ROM Storage Driver
They are based on:
  - the current Linux kernel source tree,
  - plus the PS3 patches already submitted by Geoff Levand on linuxppc-dev,
    which are in the for-2.6.23 branch of Paulus' tree,
  - plus the first 3 patches from the PS3 storage drivers series I submitted
    before, which are also in the for-2.6.23 branch of Paulus' tree.
The only changes compared to the previous submission are the kmap updates, as
requested by Jens Axboe and James E.J. Bottomley.
I didn't hear anything from the misc device maintainer (for the FLASH ROM
Storage Driver).
Paulus, please apply.  Thanks in advance!
With kind regards,
Geert Uytterhoeven
