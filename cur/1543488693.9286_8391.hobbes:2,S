No cache coherency leads to heavily broken drivers and thus O/Ses and 
requires some complexity we probably want to avoid, at least I do.
Great stupidity, in my opinion.

Paranoia of CPU optimisation for only having to deal with 32 bits and 64
bits. Since MMIO is only usable with some flush of CPU buffers, designers
could allow 8 bits and 16 bits quantities for MMIO without addressing
weirdnesses and without complexifying CPU optimization stuff. IMO,
architects were not quite aware of how a usable IO sub-system for PCI
should be.

This is pretty useless and highly stupid, IMO for the following reasons:
1 - This only can speed-up a bit IOs from the CPU and the PCI BUS is slow 
    compared to CPU. Having some instructions that deal with endian-ness 
    does suffice.
2 - The right way to do IOs with PCI is to DMA from the device and
    certainly not to stall the CPU and to use small bursts or no 
    bursts at all.
Still guys who should have learnt how IOs must be handled.

This one has also some design weirdness regarding PCI.
It seems that only Intel has been able to provide a reasonnable PCI
BUS implementation. But, on the other hand, they donnot seem to be 
capable to provide real CPUs (I mean 64 bit) in time. ;-)
