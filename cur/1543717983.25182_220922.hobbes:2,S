                BUG_ON(dma_addr < BLK_BOUNCE_ISA);
linux/include/linux/blkdev.h:#define BLK_BOUNCE_ISA             (ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD)
linux/include/asm-arm/scatterlist.h:#define ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD (0xffffffff)
That's nice.  Someone like to explain the reasoning here.
ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD is the maximum address which ISA can DMA to.  On ARM,
we support ISA DMA controllers all of which can address 32-bit, so our
setting of ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD is correct.
However, it seems that the block layer thinks this has some other meaning
and has hijacked it.
Consequently, block is rather dead on ARM at the moment.  Someone mind
explaining WTF this has happened?
