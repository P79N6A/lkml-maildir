I assumed that enabling CONFIG_MTRR would be enough to trigger it but
that did not do it (CONFIG_MTRR is enabled in defconfig).
When I used the config posted by Andrey in: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/19/61
I saw the warnings.
I did not look into what caused the warnings with Andrey's but
not with defconfig.
