Yes, thanks. That solves both problems (the reinsertion detection and
the crash). I still get the message "orinoco_lock() called with
hw_unavailable" in syslog, just in case that means something.
Speaking about messages, ever since I've been using PCMCIA (the
SourceForge stuff for 2.2 and the kernel support in 2.4), I've been
getting the following message three times in a row after insertion:
eth1: Error -110 setting multicast list.
I was told on SourceForge that I should just ignore it. However, it
covered by login prompt, so I simply commented out everything about
"multicasting" in orinoco.c. Is there a correct way to handle this?
