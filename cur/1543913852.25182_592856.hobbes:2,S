You need to drop packets after having inspected them right? Why wont 
dropping packets after a certain amount of memory has been allocated work? 
What is so difficult about that?

That is a scalability problem on large systems! Global means global 
serialization, cacheline bouncing and possibly livelocks. If we get into 
this global shortage then all cpus may end up taking the same locks 
cycling thought the same allocation paths.

Well it looks like you know how to do it. Why not implement it?
