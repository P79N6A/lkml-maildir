Subject: [PATCH] cdrom sane fallback vs 2.4.20-pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is an update to cdrom.c.   SCSI-II devices are not required
to support the READ_CD packet command.  Currently, the cdrom
driver assumes that _all_ READ_CD packet command failures are due
to READ_CD being unsupported.  Obviously, there are a million
other reasons for a READ_CD packet command to fail.  Here at my
house, the most common reason for READ_CD failures is that my
kids have, once again, scratched up my CDs resulting in bad
sectors.  So the drive hits an uncorrectable error and thinks
that READ_CD is unsupported, and then trys again using READ_10
(which takes another a few seconds to fail and, of course, again
returns an L-EC Uncorrectable Error).
This patch teaches cdrom.c to only fall back to READ_10 when
the drive reports that we sent it an invalid command...
