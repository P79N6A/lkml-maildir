Sure.  If you wrote the code in APL, it would be quite unreadable, and you could
distribute it.  See Bliss/32 (DEC) or PL/S (IBM) for examples of languages
that were used to write systems and the code distributed without a compiler.
(Note that I know of no source code in Bliss/32 or PL/S that was actually
distributed under the GPL).

Yes, but it has to be the *preferred* source form.  So you have to distribute
what you're actually using to maintain the system.  You want to claim that
the very tricky code is your preferred form, go right ahead.  Let me know how
the first time you try to fix a bug goes. ;)
It is most certainly *NOT* allowed to pass your code through a obfuscator
before shipping it out.
