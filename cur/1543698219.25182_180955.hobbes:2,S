Hi all,
I  was very pleased that some patches for controlling CPU affinities  
were merged in the 2.5 (and 2.6) releases of the kernel.
Where may I find precisions on the patches that are now included ?
Especially, with the 2.6 release :
- is it possible to control the cpu affinity of threads (as for  
processes) ?
- is there also a patch to shield cpu against the scheduler ?
- is there also a patch to shield cpu against all interruptions  
(especially hard clock interrups) ?
We here are (very) used to SGI IRIX real time facilities, but also very  
new to linux.
We plan on porting our hard-real-time applications for multisensorial  
simulation on linux. These questions are very important to us.
Thx a lot in advance,
and please believe I am VERY sorry if this is not the correct list for  
my questions, and if I disturbed serious work ;-).
If so, please let me know !
Nicolas
