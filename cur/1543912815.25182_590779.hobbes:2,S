Theo, the primary claim you made in your email that was forwarded to 
linux-kernel was:
<--  snip  -->
In 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/29/183,
 Alan Cox managed to summarize
what Jiri Slaby and Luis Rodriguez were trying to do by proposing a
modification of a Dual Licenced file without the consent of all the
authors.  Alan asks "So whats the problem ?".  Well, Alan, I must
caution you -- your post is advising people to break the law.
<--  snip  -->
It is a quite heavy accusation against Alan that saying it was OK to 
change dual licenced code to one of the offered licences would advise
to break the law.
There's nothing about goodwill or other ethical questions in your 
statement, this statement you made can be verified or falsified by 
lawyers.
If it is true, all ethical questions about this are anyway moot because 
it was illegal as you claim.
If you wrongly accused Alan, you owe Alan an apology.
