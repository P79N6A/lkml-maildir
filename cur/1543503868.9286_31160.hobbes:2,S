That can be done with RTL interrupts. They preempt everything, and can
block out everything until the work is done. But off course, due to
cache misses and other problems related to workstation type machines,
the jitter can never be as low as on a small, dedicated DSP system with
only fast RAM, L1 cache and no disturbing processes messing with the
cache when the real time interrupt isn't working.
And as I don't intend to spend 70% CPU time on context switching, I'm
not expecting to get down to the kind of latencies where the latency in
the converters is starting to become an annoying problem. I just want
slightly better performance than current native processing DAWs, and
most importantly a RELIABLE solution, usable in any place an ADAT or
dedicated hard disk recorder is used now.

I'm not surprized... The only thing that makes modern workstations
usable for low latency hard real time jobs is raw power. Caching and
other "phenomena" will always add jitter in the range of a few bus
cycles. Nowadays, we're talking microseconds here...

 for a
hint on where RTLinux was a while ago. The performance is being improved
constantly.

...but I certainly would NOT like this situation in a digital studio!
That's a basic user error.
A DAW is audio in -> all kinds of processing -> audio out. If you use
ANY form of digital effect as an insert effect on an analog mixer, you
have to be aware of the side effects anyway, and they are always present
as long as the digital effect is truly a digital one. (That is, not
based on DCAs or other zero latency components in the signal path.)

Offcourse, but IMO, it's a waste of resources in this kind of
applications. A digital audio workstation is not an active servo control
system or something like that.
And an additional note: The monitor speakers are usually not on the
exact same spot as the listener or the sound sources, and mics are
always some distance away from the source.
Hint: How fast does sound travel in air?
This makes any "problems" related to mic -> monitor latency quite
irrelevant in real life situations. Moving the speakers will affect
latency more than Audiality...

A very good one, please! :-) That means low latency enough for normal
monitoring conditions, while not burning most of the CPU power on
context switching. This is perfectly sensible and possible to do on a
good hard real time OS.
