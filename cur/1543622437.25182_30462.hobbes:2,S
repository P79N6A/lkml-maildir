That might be the most serious bug in this release: people and media reporting a "release problem".
How many people really need that small fix and are not able to take -rc4 instead final? Compared to 2.4.17, there are more than 
100 fixes in this release, that could have been more dangerous than this missing function. And there might be still people out 
there using 2.4.17 ;-)
