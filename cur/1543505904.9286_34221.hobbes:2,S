Well, I changed it to udelay(80) the time the Board need to read data.
It gave me 103 reads in one jiffy.
103*100 = 10300 reads/sec.
So, that's the problem I *need* to differenciate time here - 103
readings with the same time doesn't help :-).

Ok.  Now a stupid question :-)
How do I use RTC?  Where can I find any documentation? Example (besides
the PC Speaker one.

I will :-)
Is there any function I can use?
