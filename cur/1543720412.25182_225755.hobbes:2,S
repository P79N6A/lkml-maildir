   Hmmm ... So once again the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus :-) ?
   At least a
   grep '<.*@' /usr/src/linux-2.6.6/arch/i386/kernel/apm.c | sed 's/.*<//' | sed 's/>.*//'
   gives me:

This is pretty much for no one. And I guess you knew since you're on
the list yourself. But I think you're right when meaning
that there is not much of active maintenance anymore. Which at
least I find a little bit discouraging when looking of the state
of the ACPI support.

   It seems like I'm on my way to do so (still reluctantly). As I stated
  in my previous mails I'm not born as a hardware/BIOS hacker (more the
  application C++/Java stuff) but I'm willing to learn. When I'm
  grown up I definitely want to be linux kernel hacker :-) ...
   Currently I ripped down the 2.6.6 kernel to almost nothing
  and add one module after the other checking for proper
  suspend/resume behavior....
   The most suspicious candidates on my list are currently  the
  USB-UHCI driver and the ALSA sound system, which is my #1 candidate
  since it has not been an integral part of the 2.4.x (x<=20) kernels.
  So if anybody out there could give me guidance on how the apm code
  might interact with the ALSA sound system it would be highly
  appreciated....
  Thanks
  Sebastian
