   But hopefully nobody should have the problematic last reference to a LRU
   page _except_ the user space itself. That should be safe for page cache
   pages thanks to the truncate change.
[ Now DaveM is talking :-) ]
So let's say that we have a page going out a socket.  The socket's FD
has multiple references so when the user exit()'s the anonymous page
is still "in-flight" but the socket isn't closed and thus we won't
wait for the write to complete.
So when the user's reference is dropped, does that operation kill it
from the LRU or will the socket's remaining reference to that page
defer the LRU removal?
