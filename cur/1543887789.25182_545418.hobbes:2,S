The mobile K7s which had powernow support weren't SMP capable, so they're

X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI is already 'default y'. I think the problem lies in
that people aren't enabling its dependancy, ACPI_PROCESSOR.
We want something along the lines of..
config X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
	bool
	if SMP & X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
	  select ACPI_PROCESSOR
kconfig language quirks aside..
