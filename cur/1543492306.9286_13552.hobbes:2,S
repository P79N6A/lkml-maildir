A few months ago that was discussed on this list.  There is a header
which can be used for just such data.  The elf loader will read in
such sections and make the data readily available to the rest of the
kernel.
Unfortunately, it has been too long for me to remember the specifics,
nor can I find the articles in my archive. :(
Perhaps someone else has a better on-/off-line memory?
