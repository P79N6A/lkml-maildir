Subject: kernel.org COPYING file not current?

I was putting together a small webpage and wanted to link to the COPYING 
file for the linux kernel.
I found the one at 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING
 (also 
at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING
), but when I compared 
it with the latest version in 2.6.12.2, there were some differences.
It would be convenient to have a web-accessable up-to-date version of 
this file.  Any chance of getting it updated?
