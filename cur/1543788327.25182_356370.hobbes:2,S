Again have you any proof that there aren't any Linux firmware in the
flash of the freebox ?
How do you explain that the boot sequence isn't stateless ?
Why in case of a firmware update, you have a special state of 10 seconds
were the freebox seem to download and write some data somewhere ?
So yes may be you can't connect anymore to the free DSLAM, but there is
may be still GPL data in the flash.

For french law I don't know, but someone on gpl-violation this is true
for de and au.

No the freebox is more like a dvb box that is lended by a satellite
provider and could do firmware update via satellite.
I don't know if there are similar case for dvb box.
