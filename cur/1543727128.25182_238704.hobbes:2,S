Hi, Matt,
Perhaps I'm missing something, but how do we successfully return from
netpoll_setup without np->dev filled in?  Netpoll_setup has the following:
        if (!ndev->poll_controller) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "%s: %s doesn't support polling, aborting.\n",
                       np->name, np->dev_name);
                goto release;
        }
Thanks,
Jeff
