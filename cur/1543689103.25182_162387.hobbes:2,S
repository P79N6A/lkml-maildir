Part of step (4) is to swap the page back in (see __pin_page).

In case others are sharing this misconception: there *are* no spurious
wakeups.  But if they were to happen, the current code doesn't handle
them correctly, unlike every other primitive I know of in the kernel,
which is why I fixed it while tidying the code.
I don't know of a rule which says "thou shalt not wake a random thread
in the kernel": for all I know wierd things like CPU hotplug or
software suspend may do this in the future.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
