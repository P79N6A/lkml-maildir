hm, lets fix this. Could you enable tracing (on the yum rpm) via:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
does /proc/latency_trace have any meaningful events included for such a 
long delay? If not then it would be nice to rebuild the kernel with 
CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACING - and in any case my previous suggestion holds 
too: booting with maxcpus=1 to reproduce the latencies will give easier 
to interpret latency traces. (but if it's SMP-only then no problem, the 
latency traces are still valuable)
