Think of it as RAID1 over TCP.
Typically you have one Node in Primary, the other as Secondary,
replication target only.
But you can also have both Active, for use with a cluster file system.
So the semantics are like you have
two (to come: N) nodes and a shared disk.
only that there is not one shared disk,
but two (N) replicated ones.
btw, regarding linux kernel CodingStyle issues.
scripts/checkpatch.pl reports 2000+ lines of complaints.
I'm working on it now, it is mostly whitespace (lame excuse: phil grew
up with emacs and gnu coding style, sorry for that).
