I guess we could use:
	enum scsi_target_state state:1;
And make the enum entries start with 0 and not 1 as is today, no? With
that we get down to:
}; /* size: 356, cachelines: 12 */
   /* last cacheline: 4 bytes */
Anything else to save these 4 bytes and get down to 11 cachelines per
scsi_target instance? Following patch is on top of the previous one.
