Ok, I'm a little confused.  The last batch were all checked against
the then-current netdev-2.6 bk tree, or was the conflict with
something you'd applied between when I pulled the tree and you looked
at the patches?  As far as I can tell all the previous batch of
patches I sent you are in netdev (plus a couple from this batch), but
most are still not in upstream.
I'm now not entirely clear on whether you want patches against the
netdev bk, or against Linus bk/snapshots.
