Linux's driver model is the way it is. If you want the kernel to clean
up after a driver has puked, you need something like a microkernel I
believe, where only a minimal core kernel is a real kernel and where all
the drivers are actually in user-space, but that's no longer Linux then.
I'm not reflecting the down- and upsides to of this as I have no
experience with microkernels (and have never used OS9 or GNU Hurd
either). I know there have been attempts to port Linux to a Microkernel
but I don't know what's come out of it.
