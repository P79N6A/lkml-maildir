Well, I do not see much additional register information:
1/12: Seems to be based on
http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/mpumcu/rej09b0300_2140bhm.pdf
(and says so in the opening comment)
2/12: Seems to only rename already-known data.. plus adds some
knowledge of embedded controller, probably from pdf above.
3/12: seems to refactor existing code.
4/12: queued events are embedded controller's feature, I guess, so
this should be easy to guess.
5/12: pure linux side code.
6/12: pure linux side code.
7/12: pure linux side code.
8/12: this adds names for things we knew already. Again, this looks
like easy enough to guess. "hdaps_check_ec - checks something about the
EC" ... does not look like it came from leaked info.
(Is this what people have biggest problem with? 1-7 are still very
nice cleanups...)
9/12: pure linux side code.
10/12: pure linux side code.
11/12: pure linux side code.
12/12: improved whitelist. Trivial after discovery that some bit tells
you if accelerometer is there.
