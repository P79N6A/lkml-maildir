Looks good. Just one style nitpick.

Could we make this neater with extra braces such as:
 	for_each_domain(this_cpu, tmp) {
		if (tmp->flags & SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER) {
 			sd = tmp;
			break;
		}
	}
and same for the other uses of for_each ? I know it's redundant but it's 
neater IMO when there are multiple lines of code below it.
