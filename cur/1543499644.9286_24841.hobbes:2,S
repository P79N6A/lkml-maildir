is that they would never admit it, _and_ they would continue badmouthing
Unix/Linux/BSD. They simply can take advantage of BSD code whenever they
see fit - without acknowledging it and without giving back anything. It's
unethical and abusive, and this is what the GPL prevents. It also drains
developers from the BSD space (after all they could now just go and
develop networking code for Microsoft), which is bad for the BSD project
as a collective effort. These are just a few of the many naivities the BSD
license has, and Microsoft Halloween documents pretty accurately point
this out. They are afraid of Linux, but they are not afraid of *BSD.
