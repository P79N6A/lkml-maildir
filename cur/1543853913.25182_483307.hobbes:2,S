This kind of stuff is just sick.  Better let them play with their research
OS for this kind of thing :)  In practice any non-trivial bug fix requires
changes to global data structures so reloading a module doesn't make sense.
And for module-specific problems you should be able to hack around using
kprobes if you really need (but then again for a mission critical system
you should have proper active-active failover clustering anyway)
