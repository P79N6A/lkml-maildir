User space queries like "what is the cpuset to which this task belongs",
where the answer needs to be something of the form "/dev/cpuset/C1"?
The patches address that requirement atm by having a dentry pointer in 
struct cpuset itself.
Do you see similar queries coming in for every resource controller object
(show me the path of cpu_acct, cpu_ctl, rss_ctl ... objects to which this
task belongs)? IMO that will not be the case, in which case we can avoid
adding N pointers (N = max hierarchies) in nsproxy just to support queries of 
those sort.
If additional resource objects need to support such queries in future, we could 
add a dentry pointer in those objects as and when the need arises.
