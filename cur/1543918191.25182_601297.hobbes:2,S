This is certainly a tool issue, but if I use Debian's kernel-image "make-kpkg" 
wrapper around the kernel build system, it fails with:
cp: cannot stat `arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage': No such file or directory
Obviously, this file has moved to arch/x86/boot, but it seems like possibly 
unnecessary breakage. I've been copying bzImage for years from 
arch/x86_64/boot, and I'm sure there's a handful of scripts (other than 
Debian's kernel-image) doing this too.
For now, I hacked the tool[1]. Maybe, if we care, a symlink could be set up 
between arch/x86/boot and arch/$ARCH/boot ? Or would papering over this be 
more trouble than it's worth?
