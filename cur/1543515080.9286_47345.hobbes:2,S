Hi y'all,
  I'm wondering if any of those kernel developers with pulsating brains
(Linus, Alan Cox, Andrea Arcangeli, and friends) are planning on merging VM and
the file buffer cache. The FreeBSD people did it and it improved performance
and reduced memory utilization. Methinks Linux could benifit from this too, but
I have a habtt of being wrong.
TIA,
	Ryan
