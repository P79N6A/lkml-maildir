Another note on the urgency of standardizing Perfmon:
Anarchy is not a good breeding ground for tools that need a
stable infrastructure to mature. Being "there" is what made
PAPI and perfctr popular and somewhat standard infrastructure.
Compilers, tools, JVMs... -you name it- are all moving
fast towards using hardware counters to get feedback,
tune, monitor or measure application behavior.
The PMU is becoming a standard commodity. Once Perfmon is
"the" Linux interface, all the tools can align on it and
coexist, push their R&D forward, and more importantly become
fully productized for businesses usage. Hopefully Perfmon's
interface is powerful enough to support future needs.
Good luck Stephane :)
Cheers,
