Oho... fchflags == setsockopt? It may make sense, but... definitely queer.

OK, I'll go for that variant. Unless we want to overload {set/get}sockoptions
and add missing calls to the set. Dunno... while this has some merit
(essentially we want the same kind of control with s/protocol family/filesystem/
and s/SOL_SOCKET/FL_VFS/, moreover, some fcntl() applications could find
the place in the same space) I'm *not* sure that it's good. It would make
more sense if we didn't have old binaries around and could kill ioctl(2)
and friends for good. -ENOSUCHLUCK...
	Up to you. I think that chflags(name, level, old, new) is the
right variant, so unless you are *really* interested in extending
setsockopt() API to files I'll go for it. Comments?
