shit, it DOES happen. somehow, when network cable is unplugged it 
seems to never happen, when I am plugged in at home I believe I could 
have gotten that lockup once or twice, but when I am plugged in to 
the network at my office it seems to happen 100% of the time. I use 
DHCP in either case. I wonder if it could be related to the noise 
traffic on the network or what. I get it with both 2.4.23-pre3 and 
2.6.0-test5 with your patch. It does not seem to occur at any 
particular time - just some time (seconds to minute or two) after the 
boot up.
Could you suggest any way to at least trace this problem down?
Fedor.
