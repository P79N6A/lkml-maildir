Hi there,
The HPT chipset on the KR7A-RAID is not detected.  It comes through with a
revision 5, which crashes the Kernel (panic) on 2.4.16.  The patch below
adds the revision for the HPT372 chipset which is the relevant one,
however this will break again when a new revision comes out.  I would like
to be able to print a warning if the revision is higher than the one in
the array and if it is allow a parameter to fake the chipset as being a
lower one (at the users risk), but quite frankly my Kernel programming is
not that good!!
I don't know if this has been fixed in 2.4.17/18, if it has...sorry! :-)
