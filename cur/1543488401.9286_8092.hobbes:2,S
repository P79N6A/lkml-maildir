No go. I tried this and then gave the drive a low-level format (from the
controller's config menu at bootup), fdisked, did "mke2fs -cv /dev/sda1" and
then "e2fsck -fc /dev/sda1"; in the middle of checking for bad blocks came
this:

It's disturbing because the machine's been fine with this
configuration/hardware for at least a year. I don't think it's a bum drive,
since I replaced it when the problem first surfaced, about a week ago. I did
upgrade the machine to Debian 2.0 a couple months ago.
