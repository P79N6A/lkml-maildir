This release fixes memory usage reporting when gcc 3.x
is used on IA-64 and Alpha. Other 64-bit platforms may
be affected. Documentation has improved a bit. Thanks to
Fabian Frederick, vmstat now lets you choose display units.
See the change log for details.
For those of you still upgrading from procps 2.0.xx releases,
you can expect:
* vmstat lets you choose units you like: 1000, 1024, 1000000...
* top can sort by any column (old sort keys available too)
* top can select a single user to display
* top can be put in multi-window mode and/or color mode
* vmstat has the -s option, as found on UNIX and BSD systems
* vmstat has the -f option, as found on UNIX and BSD systems
* watch doesn't eat the first blank line by mistake
* vmstat uses a fast O(1) algorithm on 2.5.xx kernels
* pmap command is SunOS-compatible
* vmstat shows IO-wait time
* pgrep and pkill can find the oldest matching process
* sysctl handles the Linux 2.5.xx VLAN interfaces
* top shows IO-wait time if-and-only-if your kernel computes it
* ps has a new "-F" format (very nice, like DYNIX/ptx has)
* ps with proper BSD process selection
* better handling of very long uptimes
There's a procps-feedback@lists.sf.net mailing list you can
