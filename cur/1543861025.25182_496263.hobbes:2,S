Not "nearly all" -- but lots of code, yes.

No, that's fine with me.  It's fine with GCC as well
of course.

Yes.  And that problem will be fixed some way pretty soon --
simply because it _has_ to be fixed.

For a different mailing list indeed; let me just point out
that for certain important quite common cases it's an ~50%
overall speedup.

If the kernel breaks all over the place, of course you should add
the flag.  But it won't, it would break *all* programs all over
the place then, and that wouldn't be acceptable to GCC.  If instead
only a few kernel code bugs pop up, it's easy to fix.
Aaaaanyway -- my only real point was to point out that there's
no doomsday scenario here, yes current GCC TOT seems to regress
here (for some definition of that word), but GCC development
is in stage 1, that sort of thing happens.  It'll stabilise
again.
In the meantime, building git HEAD kernels with GCC 4.1 and
4.2 will probably rattle out quite a few bugs still, both
in the kernel and in GCC -- neither is used all that often
it seems?
