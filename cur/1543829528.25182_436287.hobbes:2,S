I'm not aware of one either since MMIO writes can travel
across many other chips that are not constrained by
PCI ordering rules (I'm thinking of SGI Altix...)

That's what my original concern was when I saw you point this out.
But MMIO reads here would be expensive and many drivers tolerate
this latency in exchange for avoiding the MMIO read in the
performance path.
