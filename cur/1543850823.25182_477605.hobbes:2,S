The ratio of dentries/PAGE is higher than ration of inodes/PAGE.
(On a x86_64 machine, 19 dentries per PAGE, 5 ext3 inodes per PAGE=
Therefore I suspect that the number of pages locked in dentry_cache because of 
one inuse dentry is higher.

Using 32 bytes per dentry for unused LRUs sounds too much, maybe we should 
revert LRUS handling to timestamps or things like that.
