Hi!
I have two exactly the same Athlon systems at 750MHz and 512 meg memory
(@ 133MHz). In the BIOS there is a option: "DRAM to CPU Frequency
Ratio", which can be 3:3 or 4:3. The Help says: "Using this item to set
the operating frequency of DRAM". 
I just installed Debian on the machines, rebooted, changed one machine
to 3:3, the other was 4:3, and compiled a kernel on both of them. The
time it took was almost exactly the same (about 5 min 32 sec). The 3:3
one was 0.24 seconds faster.
Does Linux ignore the DRAM to CPU Frequency Ratio (if at all possible),
is it just a useless BIOS option (because of hardware limits or
something), or is it not supposed to make the machine faster (if, what
_does_ it do then ;-) ?  (the book that came with the machine doesn't
tell me much about the option).
Thanx!
