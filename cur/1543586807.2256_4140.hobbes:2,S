No; system calls do not exit directly to userland, they exit through the
magic in entry.S (confusingly so :). If a signal is pending (which it is,
if down_interruptible fails) the return is made through do_signal, which
rewrites the return value and does the proper restarting.
(down_interruptible means it can be interrupted by a signal, btw - bad
drivers do sleep and semaphoring without _interruptible so if your HW is
bad the process can get stuck irrecoverably in the kernel)
