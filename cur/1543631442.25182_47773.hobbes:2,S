Because, as you probably know, cable problems usually manifest themselves
during high transfer rates, where DMA is the prerequisite. Up to ATA33, you
might nearly hook your drives up using a shoelace w/o running into trouble,
ATA66+, however, seems to be very sensitive to good cabling.
How about trying out what Andre Hedrick's convert.10 has to say about your
setup if you're convinced the cable is ok?

Sidenote: I'd recommend putting the two drives on separate channels, you're
losing quite a bit of performance this way when doing hda<->hdb transfers.
