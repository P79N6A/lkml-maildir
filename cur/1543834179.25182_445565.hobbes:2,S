At least two of them.

Yes, I saw that. That's a very common problem all over the kernel. Now I see 
that the nano-howto says it's this way, but I've seen the other way for 
years. One example is vmalloc_32_user that I touched on monday.
I'll submit a version 3 of this soon. In the meantime "make mandocs" should 
either warn of those or handle them the right way (aka ignore the newline). 
If it would also warn on duplicate descriptions, at least in the same file, 
this would have catched my copy&waste bug in the first version also.
