I don't really know, but I suspect it is a gcc thing.  Some how the 
standards folks got in and messed up the original idea of keeping the 
language close to the machine when they said that the data type in to 
and out of a C operator should be the same, thus not allowing the true 
mpy result to find expression in the language.  The same thing applies 
to the "/" and "%" operators, which to my knowledge, require either 
really messy macros/c code or asm to allow the machine u64/u32 to work.
