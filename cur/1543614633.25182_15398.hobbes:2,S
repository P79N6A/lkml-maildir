Curiously enough, the changes I proposed are ones that I have already
implemented for `make config` and have nearly implemented for `make
menuconfig` at the moment, and I expect to have `make xconfig` ready
early in the new year. The module name part of it is trivially easy to
implement once the code to add the basic DEFINE_MODULAR text is there,
and the only change will be that the module name is always appended to
the end of the boilerplate rather than sometimes being in the middle and
sometimes at the end as it is now.
Because of this, I have no respect for this objection at all, and I have
to say that I would have expected a much better argument from Eric (for
or against this proposal) considering his progranmming skills.

He explained that to me some time ago, and it's a similar story to this.

{Shrug} The exact text is an entry in Configure.help (under the symbol
DEFINE_UNITS as it happens) so in that sense, the fact that I made a
mistake as a result of misunderstanding the proposal is irrelevant.

No problem - just edit the entries in Configure.help to say whatever
is consistent with the usage of the acronyms elsewhere in that file.

Blame the SysAdmin for that - if I choose (R)eply to a message, it
always addresses it to whoever posted it, and CC's anybody listed
elsewhere. I don't get the ability to change the "To" field, only the
"Cc" field, so you will always get a copy of any reply I send to an
email you've posted.
Best wishes from Riley.
