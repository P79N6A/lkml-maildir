Yes, on m68k it actually doesn't point to the thread_info at all.
The point of these patches are to allow archs to put the thread_info 
structure somewhere else. Archs with a thread register can keep 
task_struct and thread_info together and directly accessable via the 
thread register. Only because i386 has no usable thread register, doesn't 
mean everyone else has to suffer.

I know and I did this intentionally, as these patches were not intended to 
be applied, they are based on Al's patches and even these aren't in -mm 
yet. I maybe should have added a [RFC].
