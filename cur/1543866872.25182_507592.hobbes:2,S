That depends on what the driver author tells us.  If he says there's only one
such device in the world and it needs a Linux drivers, but the system in
question will never be suspended, that will be fine, I think.  There are such
cases already and I see no reason why there won't be any more in the future.

No, in general this is not _that_ simple.  Please browse the archives of
bcm43xx-dev, for example.
While I agree that the support for suspend and resume _is_ generally important,
I also admit that there are situations in which it doesn't matter and there are
many people who won't care a whit for it.
