Hi!
Winmodem managed to sneak on my table, yesterday. It came in with
toshiba notebook and I did not really see it is there until I readed
some webpages.
But now it is sitting on my table and I think I want to do something
with it. There was a person on linux-kernel saying he signed NDA to
lucent and has some windows sources to look at. Could that person
_please_ contact me? [I want to sign NDA's, too, and try to develop at
least basic functionality.]

PS: Don't go telling me it is impossible. I pretty much know. I'm
_not_ aiming at v.90 modem in the first step. First step is going to
be similar to soundblaster support: turn winmodem into soundcard so
that I can at least use winmodem functionality for voice functions (my
other modem does not support voice).
