Why is that?
loop0 is backed by a MD device.

Yes, and it has worked for...  well... many years now.

It _is_ unmounted.
(I've learned that lesson years ago.  Probably after seeing fsck
complaining loudly when I tried to run it on a mounted filesystem, if
I had to guess ;-).)

The hardware works flawlessly.
The shutdown was a regular shutdown -h.
Messages on the console indicated that Linux actually tried to
shutdown the filesystem before shutting down Samba, which is just
plain Real-F......-Stupid.  Is there no intelligent ordering of
shutdown events in Linux at all?
Samba was serving files to remote computers and had no desire to let
go of the filesystem while still running.  After 5 seconds or so,
Linux just shutdown the MD device with the filesystem still mounted.
That's what happened on a user-visible level, but what could have
happened internally in the filesystem?
