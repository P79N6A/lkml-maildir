You can ask your daemon to add routes for you. I'm not sure if I like the
idea of automatic routes created by "ifconfig up", but using them you
already have a route to your peer/network when the interface is up.
A daemon like mrtd can add default and other routes for you without
any need for slow scripts.

Not really. You only flush routes associated with the interface in question,
not the whole routing table. I'd be very surprised if I someday realize
that after rmmoding the driver I still have routes using it or even the
actual interface.
OTOH ifconfig up/down and rmmod/insmod are rather administrative tasks,
like adding or removing routes is. Linux doesn't currently have "link/
protocol down" state, but I think only that condition should mark routes
as dead without removing them from the table. That would be nice, BTW.
