Yes. We can make that implicitly refresh, I'm certainly ok with that.

"wine". It's not porting, it's emulation.
But yes, I agree, I don't see any other cases where we want it. 
We basically want to support broken clients - whether they be on the other 
side of the network, or the other side of an emulation interface. That is 
the only valid reason to do this crap.
It's a fairly sizeable reason, though. On another front ("World
Domination, Fast!") we'll try to fix the problem another way, but there's 
nothing wrong with fighting on multiple fronts if you have the man-power.
