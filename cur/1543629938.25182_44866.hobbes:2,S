Hi all,
*bang*
*bang*
Hear that? Its my head, against the wall. ;)
I am trying to convert my audio cds to mp3, which involves first ripping 
the track as a wav.
I have two drives, one Creative DVD 5x, one LG CDRW drive.
My chipet is VIA K7 266 pro, 1.2ghz duron.
I have tried every combination of master / slave between the two drives, 
the drives on their own, scsi emulation through ide-scsi, purely as IDE 
drives, ommitting ide cdrom support from teh kernel completely and only 
using ide-scsi... every time I try to get a track ripped, dmesg fills up 
with hdX: lost interrupt.
If I try to rip from the DVD drive, the system hangs and its reset 
button time.
I am using 2.4.18.
Can anyone tell me where I'm going wrong? Is there anything from my 
system you need to see to help me?
Many thanks,
mikeH
