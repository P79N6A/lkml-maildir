(I have not followed the thread, so bear with me if I say anything 
irrelavant)
I have encountered at least 3 hubs (2 usb2 & 1 usb1) that will consume a 
lot of power (about 2-2.5W if the laptop power consumption readings are to 
be trusted) and heat up a lot (to the point of being too hot to touch for 
more than a few seconds) even when no devices are connected, at least on 
Linux. I have not tested them on a Windows machine to see if this is the 
case there. The USB2 ones used Cypress chips. I do not know what your h/w 
config is, but perhaps this is a similar case ?

PS: Note that the 2-2.5W consumption is the maximum that the laptop USB 
port can provide, and I have noticed that with the hub's external power 
supply connected it heats up even more.
