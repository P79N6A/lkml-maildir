Precedence: bulk

Rediff against patch-2.6.15-rc5-rt2.
Nothing was changed except s/plist_next_entry/plist_first_entry/
to match the current naming.
These patches were only compile tested. This is beacuse I can't
even compile 2.6.15-rc5-rt2, I had to comment out this line
	lib-$(CONFIG_RWSEM_XCHGADD_ALGORITHM) += rwsem.o
in lib/Makefile. I think CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK means that
lib/rwsem.c should be ignored.
After that the kernel panics at boot time, the call trace shows
	set_workqueue_thread_prio
	wake_up_process
	set_workqueue_prio
	init_workqueues
will try to look further on Tuesday.
Just to make it clear, these problems were _without_ these patches.
Oleg.
