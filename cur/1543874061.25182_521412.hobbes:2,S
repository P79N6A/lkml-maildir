I personally prefer to have them always on top so I don't have to figure 
out where to place a new function, or to re-arrange the order of the 
functions if the implementation changes. Plus I like to keep all the data 
declarations on top, and this would still require some of the 
static functions declarations to preceed it in any case. I really don't 
want to waste time with counter-argouments that are most definitely a
personal taste, so if lots of ppl feel raw about that, and it goes in the 
coding standard, I'll be happily change it.

Ack! It should, yes.

Indeed, it can't be a module, so no exit function and fs_initcall.
Thx!
