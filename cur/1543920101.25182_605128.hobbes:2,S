I hate to go completely offtopic here, but disks are so incredibly
slow when compared to RAM that there is really nothing the kernel
can do about this. Presumably the job will finish, given infinite
time.
How much swap do you have configured? You really shouldn't configure
so much unless you do want the kernel to actually use it all, right?
Because if we're not really conservative about OOM killing, then the
user who actually really did want to use all the swap they configured
gets angry when we kill their jobs without using it all.
Would an oom-kill-someone-now sysrq be of help, I wonder?
