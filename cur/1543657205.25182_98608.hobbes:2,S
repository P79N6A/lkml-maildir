I just tested it and it seems to work.  If we mark a function as
deprecated, then each use of the function emits a warning like:
	foo.c:12: warning: `baz' is deprecated (declared at bar.c:60)
Which is very informative, giving both the location of each usage and
where the little bastard is declared.
It seems like this was added in gcc 3.0, not 3.2?  It was at least in
3.1...
Attached patch adds support for usage of the attribute as "deprecated"
and is backward-compatible.  Usage is:
	int deprecated foo(void)
etc.. The attached patch is _entirely_ untested.
