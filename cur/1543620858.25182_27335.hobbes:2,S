Well, merging ALSA is going to be one big mother of a patch no matter
how you slice it :)
But I agree, it would be nice for the patch to be broken up into steps,
ie. first patch moves OSS drivers into new location, second patch adds
infrastructure, third patch adds the 1001 drivers that ALSA supports :)
Also if the ALSA guys wanted to experiment with BK, that would be a
great way to do the merge.
