Seems it doesn't handle the case of 'no media in drive' too well.
hdc - cdrom, hdd - zip drive, hdb - no device there.
hda2 is odd looking too showing a #blocks of '1', when
it's actually..
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda2           234     58168  29199240    5  Extended 
Oddly, on another machine, it detects an LS-120 drive with
no media correctly..
  22    64          0 hdd
(but still gets the 'no device' case wrong on that box).
        Dave.
