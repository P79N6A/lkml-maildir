Hi,
I dunno if this is an idiotic configuration but I made the following choices when configuring the kernel:
#
# Plug and Play configuration
#
CONFIG_PNP=y
CONFIG_PNP_NAMES=y
CONFIG_PNP_DEBUG=y
# CONFIG_ISAPNP is not set
CONFIG_PNPBIOS=y
The result when compiling was as follows:
drivers/pnp/compat.c: In function `pnp_find_card':
drivers/pnp/compat.c:39: `isapnp_cards' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/pnp/compat.c:39: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/pnp/compat.c:39: for each function it appears in.)
Regards,
David
