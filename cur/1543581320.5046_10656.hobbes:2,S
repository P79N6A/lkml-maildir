Cite the RFC please.  1034 says
# Domain names in RRs which point at another name should always point at
# the primary name and not the alias.
and 
# domain software should not fail when presented with CNAME
# chains or loops; CNAME chains should be followed and CNAME loops
# signalled as an error.
and
#    - The answer to the query, possibly preface by one or more CNAME
#      RRs that specify aliases encountered on the way to an answer.
and
# Multiple levels of
# aliases should be avoided due to their lack of efficiency, but should
# not be signalled as an error.
It's fairly clear that CNAMEs to CNAMEs are discouraged, but legal.
