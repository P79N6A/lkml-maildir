It works, i think. I get this message when I load it:
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Trying generic Via routines for device id: 3091
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000
Thank you very much. I'm very sorry if this was a lame question.
