Agreed 101%.

In all the code I've written I always check if malloc() and friends don't 
succeed. In some instances the code can even handle this gracefully and 
malloc failure doesn't cause a fatal application error.
Now if kernel kills my process it doesn't matter if I can handle the out of 
memory condition or not. The kernel already made a decision for me instead of 
my application... and never mind the data I have cached in applications 
buffers... the kernel also decided it wasn't worth writing to a disk.

Alan.. I would find it acceptable if a process is killed if it tries to 
malloc() memory *after* a previous malloc has already failed and there is 
still out-of-memory condition.
