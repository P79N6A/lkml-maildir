It is because of way how time accounting to processes works in Linux.
Your X-server gets time quantum, and starts copying data to videoram.
If it finishes before 1/HZ seconds, no consumed time is accounted to it.
As soon as task does not finish its job in 1/HZ seconds, some time is
accounted to it. Just try running some benchmark together with
your memcpy. You'll found that benchmark slowdown is (almost) linear with
memcpy size. Especially if you'll run benchmark on some nice level.
You can try varying size around 650-750kBs, and you'll find that it clibms
up very quickly in this range, just when consumed time crosses 10ms.
