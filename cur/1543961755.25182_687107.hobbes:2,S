I like this idea a lot.  I didn't like the hardcoded `.config' 13
years ago and I still
don't like it now.

Is there any reasonable way to embed the configuration file name in the kernel
image like BSD does it?  /proc/config.gz is a good way to retrieve way to
retrieve configuration information on a running system, not so good for pushing
kernels out to a network and keeping track of the config files on the build
machine.
I don't have any way of checking this now, but can /proc files like
/proc/config.gz
be exported via NFS or the equivalent?
