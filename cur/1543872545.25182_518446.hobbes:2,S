i was totally confused and thought this was the original argument:

but it's indeed the 'new' relative timeout. (It can still be a tiny bit 
inaccurate because if there are many signals then the signals will delay 
the relative timeout - so absolute timeouts are still better - but your 
fix is correct and needed nevertheless)
