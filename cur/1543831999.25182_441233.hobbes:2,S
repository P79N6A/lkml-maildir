The "reordered" thing really only matters on SMP machines, no?  In which 
case (for userspace) the locking mechanisms (mutexes, etc.) should do 
The Right Thing to ensure visibility between cpus.
The C standard requires the use of volatile for signal handlers and setjmp.
For userspace at least the whole discussion of "barriers" is sort of 
moot--there are no memory barriers defined in the C language, which 
makes it kind of hard to write portable code that uses them.
Only a couple months ago Dave Miller mentioned setting variables 
modified in signal handlers as "volatile", and you didn't complain.  If 
fact you added that they should be of type "sigatomic_t".
