I've been getting dma errors and rtc irq's being missed since moving to 
test7.  I'm really not impressed with it at all.  Whatever happened 
between it and andrew morton's 4th patch to test4 really sucked things 
up with the kernel.  I'm getting zombie processes now that access the 
filesystem (non-extent partitions).  I'm inclined to believe that there 
is corruption, but i really have no idea where it's coming from.  Too 
many things have been patched at the same time to get a feel for which 
one could be causing the problem.  Andrew Morton's branch has been nicer 
to me than linus's for a while so i'm gonna go and patch to that one. 
Even if i wanted to stop using extents,  It would be really hard to 
since i've already started using it and the process is not 
reversable....or is it?
Would i reverse the effect of using extents by copying a file that was 
written when extents were enabled to another location and then back 
again with all partitions mounted with extents not enabled but supported 
by the patch?  Would i be able to fsck the partition without fear of 
fsck completely destroying the partition? and my other ones too for that 
matter.
has there been an ata commit or something?
And it's not so much that it's hard to replicate it's that the processes 
that cause it zombify and dont usually allow the program to be run a 
second time due to it still holding locks.
