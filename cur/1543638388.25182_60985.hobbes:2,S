I've been having a similar problem, but in my case it's audio and other
non-data CD writes like VCD that have this kind of slowdown problem.
DAO vs. TAO doesn't matter in my case. IDE chipset is VIA 686b. The
problem disappears if I plug the writer to onboard pdc20265, but burns
on that are otherwise flaky.
