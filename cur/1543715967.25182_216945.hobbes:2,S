I am using the e1000 on the t41p with enabled local apic, and I got no
problem. But when I compiled the kernel (2.6.4-rc1-mm2) without local
apic (so the notebook would turn off), I got the same problem. This was,
besides a patch to the orinico driver, the only difference between the
two kernels.
The working one has these options set:
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
