   Perhaps a libdirectio would be useful?
The details are very PCI specific, so what you'd be working
on initially is a PCI centric library.
Over time things can be abstracted, but the initial PCI specific
one would be good enough for xfree86 to link to and make use
of which is a huge step in the right direction.
