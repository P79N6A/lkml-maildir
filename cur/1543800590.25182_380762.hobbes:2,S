Too dirty to be a patch.
The missing pieces are:
#include <asm/arch/hardware.h>
#define mach_read_cycles() (OSCR)
#define mach_cycles_to_usecs(d) ((d)>>2)
#define mach_usecs_to_cycles(d) ((d)<<2)
First of all, they are plain wrong, because they use a factor of 4,
whereas the correct factor is 3.6864
(so the timings in my traces are not really microseconds).
However, I do not know how to do that quickly and correctly...
(64 bit arithmetic?)
Moreover, they should go to include/asm-arm/arch-sa1100/timex.h,
because only SA and PXA have an OSCR timer, and because the factor
differs across the chips, but I did them in include/asm-arm/timex.h.
(however, the macros are not defined for *any* ARM chip in the
current tree)
