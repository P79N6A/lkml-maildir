I also tried 2.4.1-ac10, but without acpi=no-idle, my machine crashes.
Part of the output is bellow:

VFS: Mounted root (ex2 filesystem) readonly.

Warning: unable to open an initial console.
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.
Until 2.4.1-ac3(than I skipped directyl to ac10), I had no problem with
acpi support(no slowness or anything else).
If I use acpi=no-idle, the system boots and works fine.
And another thing: I've noticed kacpid in the processlist. I tried
strace -p `pidof kacpid`, and kacpid died. Should I worry ?
I use an Intel PIII 550Mhz, MB: Intel with 440BX chipset(SE440BX-2).
