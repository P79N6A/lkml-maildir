I wasn't suggesting merging them into the kernel.
I'm doing a web page to put together html versions of lots of kernel 
documentation in a place Google can find it.  Peter Anvin was kind enough to 
give me 
http://kernel.org/doc
 for this.  It would not be technically 
difficult for this web page to host translated versions of this 
documentation.
The question is, do the kernel developers want to encourage people who don't 
speak English to mess with the kernel, any more than they want to encourage 
kernel developers who don't know C?  Is kernel documentation in Chinese a 
better idea than a repository of kernel patches in C++?  (Either way, work 
resulting from this is much less likely than normal to be merged into the 
kernel.)
I don't know if this is a valid concern or not.  That's why I'm asking.

P.S.  The hardest part of putting together a kernel documentation web page is 
actually indexing it coherently.  It's not very useful to just dump together 
huge amounts of stuff from Documentation and make htmldocs and linux weekly 
news' kernel index and kerneltrap and kernel traffic and the kernelnewbies 
wiki and kernelplanet and man-pages-2.57 coverted to html with doclifter...  
Ahem.  I finally figured out how I wanted it indexed, made a skeleton to hang 
stuff on, and my laptop blew up.  Grrr.  Mostly recovered, but now OLS is 
bearing down on me and I still haven't got a new laptop...
Don't mind me, I'll catch up.
