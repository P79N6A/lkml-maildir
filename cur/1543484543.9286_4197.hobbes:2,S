Is anyone else using 2.2.x series kernels and mounting NFS filesystems from 
Digital unix systems?
We had a few unexplained crashes on our server a few days ago and my linux 
machine (2.2.1) seemed to have real problems handling the server dying.
There's some speculation that it's my 'cutting edge' kernel that was causing 
the crashes (5 in 32 hours) so we unmounted all the NFS exports and now the 
system has been stable for 3 days.
Now.. I'm not blaming linux, If digital unix can't handle NFS from a client 
then it's broken. But does anyone out there have any theories as to why, or 
experiences that might confirm/deny this suspicion?
