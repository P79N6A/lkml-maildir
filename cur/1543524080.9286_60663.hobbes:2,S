Of course you can try to use ANSI escape sequences, but it is of no use:
printk() is used to write debug messages which eventually end up in a
logfile. No need to fancy up debug messages. Besides: you can't assume
that every terminal understands ANSI escape sequences.
And no: you can't use printf() because we are in kernel mode; printf() is
for user mode.
