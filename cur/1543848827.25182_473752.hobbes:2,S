Hi,
while working on better ISO-9660 support for the Solaris Kernel,
I recently enhanced mkisofs to support the Rock Ridge Standard version 1.12
from 1994.
The difference bewteen version 1.12 and 1.10 (this is what previous
mkisofs versions did implement) is that the "PX" field is now 8 Byte
bigger than before (44 instead of 36 bytes).
As Rock Ridge is a protocol that implements a list of size tagged fields,
this change in mkisofs should not be a problem and in fact is not for Solaris
or FreeBSD. As Linux does not implement Rock Rige correctly, Linux will
reject CDs/DVDs that have been created by a recent mkisofs.
As Linux will completely disable RR because of this bug, it must be called
a showstopper bug that needs immediate fixing and that also needs to be 
backported.
The recent version of cdrtools that include the new mkisofs is located at:
