   What is the physical layout of that 2GB of memory?  You can't count
on memory being contiguous, especially on IA64 systems.  If the address
you get back is within the DMA mask of the device, then the DMA mapping
is valid.  You can run 'grep "System RAM" /proc/iomem' to get some idea
of the physical memory address map.  Thanks,
	Alex
