I've removed the poor guy from Iomega from the followups, perhaps others
could do likewise
Mathematically the answer is "no you couldn't". You might be able to
argue that a fortran implementation would be faster but not a C++ one.
And for strings C++ strings are suprisingly inefficient and need a lot
of memory allocations, which can fail and are not handled well without C
++ exceptions and other joyous language features you don't want in a
kernel. C with 'safe' string handling is similar - look at glib.
We have to make tradeoffs and the kernel tradeoffs have been to keep C
type fast string handling but to provide helpers in the hope people will
actually use them to avoid making mistakes.
