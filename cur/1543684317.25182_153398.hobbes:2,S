One way to get loaded before anything else is to do ELF binary
loading by hand in userspace.  The kernel exec loads your
program, which sets up trap handlers etc., then loads the actual
target binary by hand.  I did this for an application sandbox.
Writing the loader took less than half a day since I was able to
use a lot of kernel code from binfmt_elf.c directly, just
translating internal kernel calls into open, mmap, etc. system
calls.
