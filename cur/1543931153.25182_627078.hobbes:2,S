Sorry, I was looking at a different possible problem. The issue
is that if netdev_budget was set smaller (say 128) but device
weight was set larger (say 256). The new code would still allow
the device to do a full swipe (256) packets rather than only
128 as in earlier NAPI. I guess it is an okay behaviour change, because
we don't really guarantee that case.
The problem with the tehuti driver is the logic around priv->napi_stop.
That whole early stop concept should be removed since it just
duplicates the logic of netdev->weight but breaks the assumptions
in the calling netif_rx_action.
