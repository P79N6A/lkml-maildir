While running 2.5.30 I receive this error when running LILO with a
FreeBSD partition in lilo.conf
  Device 0x0300: Invalid partition table, 3rd entry
    3D address:     1/0/530 (534240)
    Linear address: 1/14/8446 (8514450)
I removed the fbsd entry and LILO had no problems.  I then booted
to 2.4 and readded the fbsd partition and it installed fine.
The problem seems similar to what Ingo reported for 2.5.29 however on my
system the only problem is the freebsd partition.  Also, 2.5.29 worked
fine for me.
