I first saw this problem in 2.3.51 (possibly earlier).
The problem is there for the promise controller types 20246 and 20262.
I can boot the systems by not compiling with DMA and not enabling DMA
during runtime.
Enabling DMA during runtime freezes the system instantly when drives on
the promise controllers are accessed..
