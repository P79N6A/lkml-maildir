Hi Guys,
I've been waiting for some mm/ patches to clear from -mm before commenting
too much... however I see that this patch is actually against -mm itself,
with my __mod_page_state stuff in it... that makes the page state accounting
much lighter weight AND is not racy.
So I'm not exactly sure why such a patch as this is wanted now? Are there
any more xxx_page_state hotspots? (I admit to only looking at page faults,
page allocator, and page reclaim).
Thanks,
Nick
