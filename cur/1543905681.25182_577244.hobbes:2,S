Thanks for tracking this down Mark.
The issue is that, when exec()'ing to userspace from a kernel thread,
we need activate_context() to be invoked before we try to touch
userspace at all.  This new argument handling is invoking
get_user_pages() before that happens.
activate_context() happens via flush_old_exec(), but that occurs via
load_elf_binary() et al. which is long after the argument fetching
code runs in fs/exec.c that is using get_user_pages().
(Mark, hint: activate_context() is defined to switch_mm() on
 sparc32, which is sun4c_switch_mm() which you thought was only
 invoked from context switches :-))
Touching userspace before activate_context() is questionable at best,
in my opinion.  But I can't come up with a good way to fix this right
now other than Mark's sparc patch, so I will apply it.
Thanks again Mark!
