One important thing to watch out for is to make sure that the PLT
and GOT fixups (where typically pages are mprotected to RW, modified,
then back to RO) are not in the range of pages that are shared.
And, it helps if everything that is shared read-only is 4 MB aligned.
If ld.so could do that under linux, we'd have the biggest win.
