Yeah, and where will you do that? (Possible answers are: kernel space, user
space).
I honestly vote against *these* kinds of plugins (i.e. reading .tar files,
/etc, and such). For one, it is to be done in kernel space, which means the
module code can not be swapped out. Debugging is more complex, segfaults will
kill the machine -- thus it's more open to blackhat hackers.
Also simply because it (the module code) would be a reinvention of wheel, it's
all been written before.
