What you request:

What the hardware detects it can do:

What both agreed to do finally...:

So you hardware thiks it can not do U160. Possibilities:
- Check jumpers on the drive
- Active but SE termination, so no double data rate. Check your terminator
  is LVD.
- SE device at end of chain, so no LVD also (you say your DVD/DAT are on the
  other channel...)
I would vote for SE instead of LVD active terminator ar the cause. At least
'cause I also suffered from it (dam***d hardware dealers...)
Hope this helps.
