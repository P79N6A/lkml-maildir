Sorry, at first I only noticed ACPI in your mail, but after reading it
again, I also noticed APIC. So now, you can only try not to initialize
some peripherals (IDE, network, display, etc...) by removing their drivers
from the kernel. You may end up with a kernel panic, but that does not
matter is you boot it with "panic=5" so that it automatically reboots
5 seconds after the panic. You should then finally identify the subsystem
which is responsible for your problems. Perhaps you'll even need to remove
PCI support :-(

Willy
