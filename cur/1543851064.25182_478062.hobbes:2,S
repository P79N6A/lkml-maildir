I don't think this is necessarily true.  Today, if a kernel exceeds its
allocation limits (runs out of memory) it gets killed.  Doing the
limiting at mmap() time instead of fault time will keep a sparse memory
applications from even being able to run.
Now, failing an mmap() is a wee bit more graceful than a SIGBUS, but it
certainly introduces its own set of problems.
