What do you see as bad? The ability to change tuning parameters on the fly
or the lack of such ability? At the very least, I need to be able to poke
settings with a debugger, and a more systematic and user-friendly interface
would be preferable.
Your example is exactly what I'm talking about! Neither the applications nor
the kernel are "stupid"; they are doing exactly what they're being paid to
do. My job as a system tuner is to make sure that the users get the response
times and throughputs they need, given the inherent limits of how much they
can afford to pay for processors, memory and disk. As an aside, I also need
to be able to figure out what those limits are -- when it's time to add
capacity rather than just tune the system.
