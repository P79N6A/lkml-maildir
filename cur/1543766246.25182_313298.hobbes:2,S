Hello Chris,
   But the system works pretty fine when other applications are running.
Oncei load the driver, the system gets messed up. Could it be the
problem with the way I handle DMA and interrupts?? I mean, is it
possible to mess up everything by wrong programming??? This driver
works prefectly on the other IPCs we have, but not on the two-piece
board (Chino-Laxons) systems we have. The DMA channels are both free
before loading the drivers all the time, and one it is loaded, the
/proc/dma file shows the DMA has been hooked properly. Could it still
be the problem with the CPU/Cache/Chipset as you said? If yes, then why
is it throwing up the error only when I load the driver? Or is it
really the problem with the driver programming? Please let me know as
soon as possible.
Thank You in advance,
Harish K Harshan.
