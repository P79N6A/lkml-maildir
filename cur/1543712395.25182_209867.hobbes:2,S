Please clarify symptoms regarding fsck at boot and Oops. Are they like mine?
Symptoms I have had with a compact flash boot hda (ide) are that
clean boot with fsck doing nothing is OK no Oops.
If fsck corrects anything and boot continues then Oops will occur. That is I
need to reboot machine after fsck rc=1 or I get Oops.

Ross.
