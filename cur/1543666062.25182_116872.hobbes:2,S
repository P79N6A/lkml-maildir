Try 2.4.21-preHighest-acGreatest (or 2.4.21-preHighest and enable all
matroxfb related options as last time I checked drivers/video/Config.in
was still wrong in Marcelo's tree). 
Problem is that your onboard G200 uses 14.318MHz XTAL, while all other 
G200's use 27.000MHz, so you are getting 32Hz vertical refresh instead 
of 60Hz... As a temporary solution booting with 
'video=matrox:vesa:....,fv:113' could give you picture, but accelerator 
will run at 53% of its nominal speed and so on.
Or you can replace 27000 with 14318 in drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_DAC1064.c
and rebuild your kernel. But upgrading to latest Alan's 2.4.x is preferred
solution.

P.S.: Of course this assumes that your G200 has connected BIOS to it.
If you'll get "matroxfb: Your Matrox device does not have BIOS" or
"matroxfb: BIOS on your Matrox device does not contain powerup info",
you are lost and I'll have to find another solution for Vectra owners.
