I see how we can use such a tag object to find a specific commit object
in the tree. But if you put the tag objects in the tree as well we now
have to figure out a way to find the tag objects.
Why not keep the tags object outside of the tree in the tags/ directory.
That way it is easy to find them, and simple to validate all tags or
update the signatures if you lost your key.

Others already mentioned the gpg clearsign and verify options, to find a
public key that you haven't seen before it is probably easiest to use a
keyserver. If verify complains that it doesn't know a key it will print
a key-id that identifies it. That id can then be looked up as follows,
    gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --search-keys 0xA86B35C5
    gpg: searching for "0xA86B35C5" from hkp server wwwkeys.pgp.net
    (1)     Linus Torvalds <Linus.Torvalds@Helsinki.FI>
		1024 bit RSA key A86B35C5, created: 1996-06-08
    Keys 1-1 of 1 for "0xA86B35C5".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > q
Ofcourse trusting a key obtained this way is another thing altogether,
and would probably depend on who signed it and such.
