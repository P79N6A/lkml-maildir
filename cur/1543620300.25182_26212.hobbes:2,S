I am happy with his entry. "I want these entries...." was targeted mostly at
other entry makers.

Hmm. Don't know how to do it best... reverse date sort clearly shows obsolete 
entries, I like it. Also people might like to see who is in the upper part of 
the list (i.e. who is active), I like it too.

To improve lk development process. To help bug reports and patches reach
_relevant_ addresses. This is big problem now, big guys may ignore small 
fixes, fixes posted to lkml are likely to never even _reach_ big guys who 
don't read lkml (guess who :-). This confuse newcomers and J. Random Hackers.
I hope patchbot and dynamically updated maintainer list may help lk 
development scale better.
