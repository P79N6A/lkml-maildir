I don't use TBird (seamonkey fan) but I assume the patch can just be 
attached rather than inlined. Some mailers are pretty arcane otherwise.
But I do like the idea, but the issue of things which parse 
/proc/PID/status hasn't had comments. A good parser would ignore what it 
didn't understand, or take everything, not everyone has a good parser. ;-)
