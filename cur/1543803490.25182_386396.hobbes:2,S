Even though it is a bit more work on kernel side, we should allow changing the 
mode of virtual devices. Let's face it, even though we find multi-BSS 
capabilities very interesting, 999 of 1000 users won't care due to the two 
facts that IPW firmware IMHO doesn't allow it and virtual interfaces are 
limited to one channel anyway. These users rightfully expect to have one 
interface and be able to do all configurations on it.
