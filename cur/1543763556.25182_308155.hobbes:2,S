-What:	/proc/sys/cpu/*, sysctl and /proc/cpufreq interfaces to cpufreq (2.4.x interfaces)
-When:	January 2005
-Files:	drivers/cpufreq/: cpufreq_userspace.c, proc_intf.c
-Why:	/proc/sys/cpu/* has been deprecated since inclusion of cpufreq into
-	the main kernel tree. It bloats /proc/ unnecessarily and doesn't work
-	well with the "governor"-based design of cpufreq.
-	/proc/cpufreq/* has also been deprecated for a long time and was only
-	meant for usage during 2.5. until the new sysfs-based interface became
-	ready. It has an inconsistent interface which doesn't work well with
-	userspace setting the frequency. The output from /proc/cpufreq/* can
-	be emulated using "cpufreq-info --proc" (cpufrequtils).
-	Both interfaces are superseded by the cpufreq interface in
-	/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%n/cpufreq/.

 What:	ACPI S4bios support
 When:	May 2005
