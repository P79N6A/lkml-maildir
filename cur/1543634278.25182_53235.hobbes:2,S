I hope this is not off-topic. If it is, please point
me in the right direction.
I'm currently writing a Linux Kernel module. Does
this have to be under the GPL because it uses kernel
routines? I really don't know of a way around
using kernel routines because that's whatcha gotta
do inside the kernel. :)
Hopefully this won't be an issue (it's not classified
material or anything). I'm still waiting for my
manager to get back to me on it.
