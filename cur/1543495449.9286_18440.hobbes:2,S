No, not buggy.  It was intensional as a test for determing if the kernel
got the geometry translations correct.  Thus applying the translation
rules from the specs to correct the CHS values in drive->id and the
correction of the Current capacity based on the LBA capacity that is used
to determine the actual vender reported CHS.

Now that is a little crass, my friend..........
Yes is was a message for a learning tool that did get us to the point
where modern kernels will handle HUGE drive's geometry now.  We still have
disagreements over the final implimentation, but the DARN thing works.
In time the clarification of drive->id will come about.
For now there are way to may BIOSes out there that do not handle extended
INT13 functions and never will.  Time and the will to leave some antiques
helpless will only resolve our philsophical differences of implentation.
Inclusion of 1992/3 ISA-IDE cards is still a requirement fo backawards
compatablity.  For now we are stuck with the geometry method that has
proven to work, regardless of how offensive and painful it is for others
to look upon.

I guess not, but hang on to that binary be cause it will not compile gain
against the current kernel code.
