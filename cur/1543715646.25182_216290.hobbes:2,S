Hello Linus, Andrew,
I'm sending you a set of 9 patches that sync the
LinuxTV.org CVS with latest linux-2.6.5.
I'm glad that I can announce that we have recently
forked off our 2.6 development tree, so we are really
looking forward to implement
- proper kobject/sysfs support
- proper firmware loading for frontend drivers
- removal of dvb-i2c and use of kernel i2c instead
- other interesting 2.6 specific things
This is the last patchset that rides the dead "2.4 compatiblity"
horse.
As usual, detailed informations about what changed can be 
found at the top of each file.
Please apply! 
CU
Michael.
