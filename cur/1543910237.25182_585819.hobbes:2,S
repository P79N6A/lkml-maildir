This is also a series of falsehoods.  All packet filtering,
queue management, and packet scheduling facilities work perfectly
fine and as designed with both LRO and TSO.
When problems come up, they are bugs, and we fix them.
Please stop spreading this FUD about TSO and LRO.
The fact is that RDMA bypasses the whole stack so that supporting
these facilities is not even _POSSIBLE_.  With stateless offloads it
is possible to support all of these facilities, and we do.
