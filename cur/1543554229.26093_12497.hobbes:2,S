Actually, what most people expect it to represent is schedulability of
new tasks.  The problem is more one of:
a) Expecting a fixed relationship between the specific number and the
behaviour of the machine;
b) The long time constants.
On an 8-way machine a load average of 16 is not particularly high, even
if you only count runnable processes, for example.
