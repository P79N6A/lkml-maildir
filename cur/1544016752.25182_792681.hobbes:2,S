 You can actually escape the FPU emulator if you have a proper computer 
(an i386/80287 combo, anyone? ;) -- we've got it right actually :) ), but 
the rest and overall I agree with you.  And I think i386-class cores can 
be still seen in some embedded applications, so there may be non-epsilon 
interest yet.
