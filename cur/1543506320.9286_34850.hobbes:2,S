I've received the suggestions to test with kernel 2.0.x; it doesn't
work with that either. Also, the use if IRQ 3 seems weird, but works
very well for my other PCMCIA cards. I have no other devices competing 
for that IRQ, and while attempting to get this running on 2.0.36 I
disabled all IRQ's one at the time, and still no go.
The problem is in the kernel IDE part, that for some reason refuses to 
accept the Nikon Coolpix IDE driver.
Complete error, from the log, as follows:

IRQ 3 is available; I'm posting this message through a network card
that uses IRQ3.
