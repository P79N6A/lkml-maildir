Agreed.

Yes, I just grepped through the kernel source, and it looks like we have
to re-adjust loops_per_sec (defined in init/main.c). This would be 
enough on the StrongARM SA-1100.

Store the boot-time bogomips value in a separate variable, and each
time the clock frequency changes, recompute the new value and store
it in loops_per_second. The udelay function is small enough to fit in
even the smallest CPU cache, so the scaling would be linear with the
CPU frequency.

I don't know if APM warns you about the changed processor speed, but if
it does, I'm sure it will vary wildly between computers. A userland program
to inform the kernel would be nice. If APM doesn't tell you, the userland
program will till be able to recompute the processor speed using things
as load average, initial CPU speed, and the time do to spin in a closed
loop.

It's fairly expensive (see init/main.c): it's a close loop that just does
a lot of delays to and compares the delay with a reference value.
