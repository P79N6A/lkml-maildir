Well the problem sounds really strange then.  Why are kmalloc/vmalloc
being talked about at all, if we are dealing with userspace-supplied
buffers?
IF copy_to_user is being used here, userspace buffers in kernel space
are pointless.  Any userspace buffer supplied to read(2) must by design
be a different buffer than the 2nd arg of copy_to_user.  If copy_to_user
is being used, then there is a "copy" taking place...
Richard, if you want to read directly into userspace buffers, kiobufs
are the way to go...   If you don't want to ever swap them in and out,
you can mlock(2) them.  Or simply allocate the memory in the driver, and
mmap those buffers.  Much easier than read(2), and it eliminates any
copy step.
