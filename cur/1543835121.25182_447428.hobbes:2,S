I would greatly prefer a sysfs interface.
Having a clean, textual sysfs API that's easily accessed from shell
has been extremely conductive for the development of the tp_smapi
driver -- users can easily test and script the driver without extra
programming and userspace components. Since tp_smapi is (AFAIK) the
most feature-rich battery driver we now have, this is some to
consider.
(If you're not convinced yet, let me say one word: udev.)
