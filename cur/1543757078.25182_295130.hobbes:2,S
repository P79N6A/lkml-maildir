It would be good idea if protocols were initialized in many difefrent
places, but the all are called from one place - psmouse_extensions.
Some protocols that can be detected without changing hardware state
have 2 functions - detect and init and the others have ony detect
which does initialization as well. But they all are called from the
same place.
psmouse_initialize has somewhat confising name, it is not "initialize
protocol", it is "enable streaming and initialize common parameters,
such as rate and resolution". Plus I think it is too late to do
protocol init in psmouse_initialize as this will not allow falling
back to "lesser" protocols if higher prtocol initialization fails.

I am not sure what difference does it make - if there is no reconnect
hamdler psmosue will end up calling psmouse_extensions which will
re-initialize hardware with proper function for the protocol. It still
does not require a handler in psmouse structure.

You can hide all of it right in lifebook_detect or acknowledge that
you have 2 fucntions and call them from psmouse-base, like synaptics
and alps do. I don't think it exposes lbtouch internals too much.
