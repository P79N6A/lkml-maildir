Hi,
I was looking at the usage of bdevname(), cdevname(), and kdevname(),
and noticed that they each return a pointer to a static buffer.
This buffer contains a formatted device name, which is typically
printed immediately following the call. However, I don't see any
explicit lock protection for these buffers.
For SMP systems, is there something implicit in their use that
prevents a race on these buffers? Has anyone seen garbled device
names being printed (which might be attributed to a race)?
