You will not beat a pure devfs solution in terms of speed.
Enumeration is not a real problem. The real target of the hotplug
system is configuration, not enumeration.

And you need to report loss of events. Doing this all by ioctls is
very questionable.

Then the method of invocation of your configurator will not matter with
regards to speed. Out of order issues matter, but can be solved easier.
It seems to me that you should take a close look at devfs and devfsd.
