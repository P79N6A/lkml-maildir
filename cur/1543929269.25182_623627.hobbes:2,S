Subject: [patch] skip writing data pages when inode is under I_SYNC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
Since I_SYNC was split out from I_LOCK, the concern in commit 
4b89eed93e0fa40a63e3d7b1796ec1337ea7a3aa is not longer valid.
We should revert to the original behavior: in __writeback_single_inode(),
when we find an I_SYNC-ed inode and we're not doing a data-integrity sync, 
skip writing entirely. Otherwise, we are double calling do_writepages()
