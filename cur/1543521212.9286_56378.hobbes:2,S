    Linus has expressed a preference for keeping the e820 map intact,
    so that sort of patch might not fly very far.  In any case, the
    recent patches (both my memory detect patch and Nathan's big
    memory region merge/paranoia/acpi reclaim/kmem= patch) both massage
    the bios data into a second array of memory regions, all of which
    have been sanitized for your protection.
