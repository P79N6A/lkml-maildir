I wanted to ask this question a zillion times already but I have always 
forgotten - is there any repository for -rt (quilt, git) which would 
provide more 'broken-out' view of the patchset, or the only public thing 
is this one huge patch?
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Special
:Search?search=quilt&go=Go 
didn't seem to provide too much information (the same for git, etc).
Thanks,
