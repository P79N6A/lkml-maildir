FireWire is an USB competitor. I remember the first IEEE1394
announcements about five-six years ago and suddently someone (IIRC M$
and Intel) unveiled their "Universal serial bus" spec and I thought to
myself "oh look, once again a good solution goes down the drain
because people with market share drive an inferior solution that is
five cents cheaper".
FC really is another league. Talk SAN. Talk storage switch
fabrics. Talk redundant switched pathes to disks in another
building. Talk Enterprise solutions.
