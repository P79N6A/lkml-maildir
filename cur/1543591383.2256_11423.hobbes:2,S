Is there support in linux for ATA overlap/queuing ?
It should ( among other things ) improve concurent performance
of two devices on the same channel.

No, queuing is broken and requires a special host to do the auto-polling.
Right now only HighPoint has a host that will perform that operation.
Also it requires TFAM and that will not be include until 2.5.
ATA-overlap or ATAPI-overlap?  The later is known as DSC based on
SFF-8020/8070/8090, I have forgotten where it is located but I have the
docs, and it is supported in ide-floppy and ide-tape.
