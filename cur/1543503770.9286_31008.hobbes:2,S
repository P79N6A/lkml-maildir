No, it doesn't.  There are also messages such as
kernel: nfsd_create: dentry .dt/tmp not negative!

And that's all?  I don't need any of the others?
Thanks for your attention.  I'm in the process of setting up a VMWare
installation which I can patch up and try out, so if you have any patches
you'd like me to test, I'll be able to do that safely.  (I cannot
guarantee that I'll get it done though, I'm hitting some hard deadlines,
which is why I'm not just waiting for the NFS patch merge in 2.2.12.)
