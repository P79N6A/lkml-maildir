Hello Jesse,

As I said in my first mail, I didn't want to go that way as one of the
two DUPLEX_FULL or DUPLEX_HALF is defined as being 0, which prevents
detecting incorrect/incomplete initializations.
The problem I had came from :
mii-tool -F 100BaseTx-FD eth0
when at the same time the ethtool interface was OK.
But you are right, the change I made missed the second caller.
The correct change is yours, though for the reason I put above, I think
it'll make it harder to spot other bugs ;)
Well done,
Paul
