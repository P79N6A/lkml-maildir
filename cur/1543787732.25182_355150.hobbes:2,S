Hello Nick,
 In case /proc or /sys wouldn't be preffered, a simple key value
binary format would do.
 First a key/value pair count. Followed by the key/value pairs, which
consist out of the value and key prefixed by their size.
 Your user and kernel code could ignore keys they don't regognize.
 A better way though, is negotiate what types of structures to pass.
 The user space program would support all previous version of the kernel module.
