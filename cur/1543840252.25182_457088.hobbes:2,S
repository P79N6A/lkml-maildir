ROTFL!  No, you were stating that the APM bios stuff was removed, and
I gave the reason for it.  Why are you now objecting to my explaination?

MIPS copied it because presumably it was useful for them.

It could well become a common interface.  But it is NOT power management
infrastructure.  It is merely a _userland_ interface.  Nothing more.  It
does not do anything other than that.

This APM is just a userland interface.  It has nothing to do with actual
power management.  CPU idling is handled entirely differently on ARM.

That's what the userland interface is called on x86.  We could've called it
apm_userland_interface_emulation_and_not_a_power_management_infrastructure.c
but although that clearly states what it is, it would've been far too long
a name. 8)
