Basically, from what I've read it translates to having a unified single delivery,
per syscall capabilities system that's not scatter-brainded hack spread out in the
Linux kernel now, right ?
You basically get all this simple and elegant encapsulation in one architectural
effort, right ?
With processes and signals as the exceptions ?

Uh, what you're saying is that the vnode/VFS interface is identical in structure
to Eros capabilities, but it not treated in uniform manner ?
