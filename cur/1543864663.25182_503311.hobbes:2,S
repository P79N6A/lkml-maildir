If you recal, tg3 was created by the community because the vendor
refused to open their driver up.  They only reluctantly now support it
because it went into the main kernel tree and the distros then refused
to accept the closed driver.
So there's a perfict example of what I'm talking about :)
Also, look at the rest of the system (ide, SATA, USB, firewire, driver
core, PCI, etc.)  None of that was done by a vendor, but by the
community.

They don't know about them, or they don't have the hardware to test?
Seriously, let the kernel-janitor's project know about any issues you
have and they will be glad to jump on it.  Those people are just
chomping a the bit to do something a bit bigger than "compiler warning
cleanups" :)

Are you sure?  That spec just came out not so long ago and I haven't
seen any real devices support it just yet.  That said, I do know of a
few people who are working on implementing the standard, try asking on
the linux-usb-devel mailing list to find out what their status is.

If so, he should let people know :)

Um, that's how Linux has gotten to where it is today and continues to
grow. Just because none of us wanted to do IB drivers, doesn't mean that
the model doesn't work for devices that are actually sane :)
