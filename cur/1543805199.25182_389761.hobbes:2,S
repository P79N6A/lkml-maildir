I could not find any code that used the tty read_lock
when pushing data. So at least its a clean start.

OK, good.

Unrelated, yes.
But if space == 0 then tty->buf.tail could be NULL
Touching tb could oops. I think you already do a similar
check in tty_insert_flip_string() etc.

The only difference seems to be schedule_delayed_work()
in tty_schedule_flip() vs schedule_work() in con_schedule_flip().
All three:
tty_schedule_flip()
con_schedule_flip()
tty_flip_buffer_push()
seem to be duplicates other than that.

There is still the esp and cyclades driver which
schedule the buf.work directly which need to be
switched to one of the above 3 functions.
I also found a case where the active flag
is not cleared correctly. (when a partial buffer is
filled and a new tail buffer is allocated before
calling one of the schedule functions.
I'll fix both of these up tomorrow, post a new
patch and continue testing.
Thanks,
Paul
