Nice : )

Constant-current / constant-voltage - just like Li-Ion batteries are
supposed to be charged. Talk about complexity ; )
IMHO battery "care" even in modern laptops sucks, so I'd rather have two
battery packs, one in use and the other one being charged. External
chargers don't seem to exist, AFAICS, so I'd very much like to build
one. Welcome to utopia...

Yup, the chemical processes inside the cells depend on temperature - do
your chargers monitor that as well?
Thanks a bunch,
