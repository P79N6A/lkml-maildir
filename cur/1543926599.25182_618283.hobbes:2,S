Ow.  So the above timeout would take 10x longer.  That probably won't break
anything, but quite a few drivers do udelay(1) for post-IO settling times
and they might not like it.

Yup, with a few smarts in there we could work out which is the best to use,
and also compensate for the setup costs.
It doesn't sound very 2.6.24ish though.
As a quicky things perhaps we could only do the preempt_disable()/preempt_enable()
if the TSCs are unsynced?  Do we reliably know that?  I guess not..
