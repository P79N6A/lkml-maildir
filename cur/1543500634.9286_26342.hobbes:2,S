Hi Ted.

Hang on! In an earlier email, you said that the reason that mke2fs
preallocates 12 blocks to lost+found is because e2fsck has problems
allocating blocks when fixing a corrupted file system, but now you
state that no such problem exists !!! Which is it?

I don't have any spare scratch partitions to try anything like that
on, and I wasn't willing to scramble any of my production systems just
to find out the answer, hence my asking on here...
Best wishes from Riley.
