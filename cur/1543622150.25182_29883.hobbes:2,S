Most SCSI drivers are not using the 2.4 PCI API, which has been
documented and stable for a while now.
This is need for transparented support for cardbus and hotplug PCI, not
some pie-in-the-sky code asthetic.  This will become further important
as 2.5.x transitions more and more to Mochel's driver model work, which
will among other things provide a sane power management model.
To tangent, IDE and SCSI hotplug issues are interesting, because a lot
of people forget or mix up the two types of hotplug, board (host)
hotplug and drive hotplug.
