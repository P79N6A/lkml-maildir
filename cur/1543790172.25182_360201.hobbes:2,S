To show just how fragile your tests are, here is what my laptop reports with 1 
GB memory:
bwaite@ronzoni:~> uname -a
Linux ronzoni 2.6.11.4-21.9-default #1 Fri Aug 19 11:58:59 UTC 2005 i686 i686 
i386 GNU/Linux
bwaite@ronzoni:~> du /proc/kcore --block-size=1M
897     /proc/kcore
bwaite@ronzoni:~> echo $(($(stat -c %s /proc/kcore) / 1024 / 1024))
896
bwaite@ronzoni:~> dmesg | grep MEM
127MB HIGHMEM available.
896MB LOWMEM available.
bwaite@ronzoni:~> dmesg | grep Memory:
Memory: 1033684k/1048248k available (1866k kernel code, 13796k reserved, 658k 
data, 204k init, 130744k highmem)
In short why not use free and show what your users can use. Otherwise, just 
make a static motd and change it whenever you change memory configurations. I 
can't believe you are changing that often. If you are going to go overboard 
and write a script just start doing the round up on your own.
Thanks
Brian
