Yes.  Cort is indeed the overall, head PPC guy.  Paul M does a lot too. :)
However, all of these name changes have gone past not only those two, but
a large portion of the PPC kernel community as well.  Everyone likes 'em,
or at least agrees they aren't bad changes.

Yes, they do.  Which is partily why I was actually going to wait until
2.5 for many of these to come in.

The counter point to this is what does "CONFIG_6xx" or 8xx mean?  It's as bad
as CONFIG_Mxxx imho :)

Yes.  Symbol changes should be a 2.5 thing anyways.
