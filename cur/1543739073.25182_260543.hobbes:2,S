i have released the -U1 PREEMPT_REALTIME patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-U1
this is a strict bugfixes-only release. With -U1 i cannot reproduce any
of the bugs on my testsystems anymore, but take care nevertheless, this
is still experimental code.
Changes since -U0:
 - bugfix: fixed the highmem related crash reported by Adam Heath and i 
   think this could also fix the crash reported by Mark H Johnson.
 - bugfix: fixed a number of networking related soft-lockups, caused by
   a deadlock scenarios in the ipv4, netfilter and net-xmit locking
   code. This could fix the lockup reported by Lorenzo Allegrucci.
 - bugfix: enable interrupts in the int3 handler - gdb will otherwise
   trigger a kernel debug message.
 - cleanup: reworked the RCU API wrappers, we now have the following
   variants:
     rcu_read_[un]lock_spin(&spinlock)
     rcu_read_[un]lock_bh_spin(&spinlock)
     rcu_read_[un]lock_sem(&semaphore)
   this change was necessary for the network locking fixes.
 - debugging helper: SysRq-T will now print the stacktrace of currently
   running tasks too. (They might be a bit unreliable occasionally but
   very useful to debug deadlocks.)
 - configurability fix: disabled the /proc/kernel/softirq_preemption and
   hardirq_preemption runtime flags (and the softirq-preempt= and
   hardirq-preempt= boot flags) if PREEMPT_REALTIME is enabled - in the
   fully preemptible model these must always be on.
there are no known bugs at this moment, so please re-report any issues 
you might still encounter.
to create a -U1 tree from scratch the patching order is:
