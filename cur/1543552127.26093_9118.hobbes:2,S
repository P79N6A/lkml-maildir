Which ext3 version, exactly?  0.0.2f had quota problems because ext3
wasn't doing quota writethrough, so that inode cleaning could force
out random dirty quotas at any point.  0.0.3b should fix that.  If it
doesn't, I'll try to reproduce it here.

Possible in 0.0.2f, but in 0.0.3b all of the quota updates should be
flushed in the context of the calling transaction.  Such updates are
always accounted for in the worst-case calculations of how many
journal blocks a transaction might need.
