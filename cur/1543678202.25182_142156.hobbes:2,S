Hello people,
i appologise if my question is too stupid. I'm trying to debug
experimental kernel module (network stack), running 2.4.20(x86),
and I have encountered sort of lockup/abnormal state. That is,
console doesn't respond to any normal keys or VT-switch, mouse
is unresponsive, network seems unresponsive too, but num-lock
is alive and ctrl-alt-del causes clean shutdown, so the kernel
probably doesn't get damaged but just somehow blocks. What could
this be? Any hints greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
