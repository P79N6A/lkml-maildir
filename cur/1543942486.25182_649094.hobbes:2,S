As Stephen mentions later, Smack uses CIPSO. sshd does not like
any IP options because of traceroute, and must be built with that
check disabled with the current Smack version. I have been looking
at using unlabeled packets for the "ambient" label, it appears that
doing so would make life simpler. I will get right on it.
Application behavior in the presence of IP options isn't
always what I think it ought to be.
