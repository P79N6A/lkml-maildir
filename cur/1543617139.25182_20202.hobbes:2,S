Right now, neither lsmod nor the boot time messages  necessarily give you that 
information.  lsmod only works if the driver is in fact a module.  My 
/var/log/dmesg contains no message from the NIC on my motherboard.  And
going from the driver to the config symbol isn't trivial even if you *have*
the lsmod or dmesg information.  
And anyway there are settings you can't even recover by looking at the
hardware, such as whether KHTTPD or BSD process accounting were turned
on.
Sure, Melvin could remember a whole bunch of state, or a whole bunch
of rules for reconstructing it. But isn't sweating that kind of detail
exactly what *computers* are for?  
Melvin, you may be sure, has more important things on his mind...
