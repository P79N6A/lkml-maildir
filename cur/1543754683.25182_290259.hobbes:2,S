Those are all kernel subsystem names, and as such all are supported
directory structures for udev, the part that is distro specific is that
they supply different scripts.
There won't be any "scsi" devices since they have no dev (the upper level
drivers have them); sg shows up as scsi_generic. sd is block.
You will still have to figure out via sysfs if you want to run your agent
even for subsystem block (i.e. figure out the host/driver type, I assume
you don't want to run it on hd or standard scsi disk drives).
I don't know why this is an issue for "new" devices, this should be a
problem for you when they first show up; existing and new devs should be
handled the same way.
