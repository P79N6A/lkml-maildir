haifa-enabled egcs-19990321 + binutils-2.9.1.0.22b gives a linux-2.2.4 that
hangs on boot for me (i586, UP) after "Ok, booting kernel". Some
experiments creating hybrids with files compiled with egcs-1.1.2 show that
a kernel using _only_ arch/i386/kernel/time.o compiled with egcs-1.1.2
boots, but crashes very shortly after.
Older snapshots (with the corresponding older kernels ;-) gave kernels that
either got one packet back from "ping localhost" or none at all.
ifconfig(8) showed the packages going into lo, but not comming out. The
experiments mentioned above were a step in the direction to find out what
was going on, but the non-booting and crashing make me _very_ uneasy.
