Well no. Debian has a gcc package which is `the' compiler (gcc 2.7.2
in slink, egcs 2.95 in potato) and _also_ a gcc272 package which is
a seperate compiler (use gcc272 instead of gcc to call it). I compile
kernels with gcc 2.7.2 since I don't quite trust egcs and the kernel
together, I have this nagging feeling that it might be the cause of
all these `2.2.9/10 FS corruption' reports.
Mike.
