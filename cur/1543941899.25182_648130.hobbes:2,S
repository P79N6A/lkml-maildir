Traditionally a lot of filesystem related system calls are not
interruptible, and for good reason.  For example what happens, if an
app receives a signal, while the filesystem is performing a rename()
request?  It would be very confusing if the call returned EINTR, but
the rename would successfully complete regardless.
We had a related problem with the open(O_CREAT) call in fuse, which
was interruptible between the creation and the actual open because of
a design mistake.  So it could return EINTR, after the file was
created, and this broke a real world application (don't have details
at hand, but could dig them out if you are interested).
I don't know what NFS does, but returning EINTR without actually
canceling an operation in the server is generally not a good idea.

Oh, I have no idea.  And I wouldn't want to do a full audit of all the
filesystems to find out.  But if you do, please go ahead.

That's a rather poor excuse against a simple solution which would
spare us some backward compatibility problems.

Implement the above suggestion?  Or something else.
Otherwise I have to NAK this patch due to the possibility of it
breaking existing fuse installations.
Thanks,
