Hwody all,
	I just spent a couple of hours dicking around with 2.2.12 this
morning rebuilding a news server under RedHat 6.1. I've got a pair of 9
gig drives in a RAID 0 configuration for the news spool. I like to keep my
kernel size down to a minimum and rebuild everything that is possible as
modules, so I rebuilt from the stock 2.2.12 kernel sources.
	It took hours of screwing around, fiddling with the /etc/raidtab
and going down just about every road possible to try and get the /dev/md0
RAID built. It really should have been easy.. :)
	In any case, we ran into a problem whereby the "mkraid" command
failed. An strace revealed the following;
open("/dev/md0", O_RDONLY)  = 9
ioctl(9, 0x800c0910, 0x804fab8)         = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
And the following error;
write(2, "mkraid: aborted, see the syslog "..., 70) = 70
Which essentially tols us to look at syslog and the /proc/mdstat file,
which had nothing in it.
Finally, in a fit of rage, I rebooted into the stock RedHat 6.1 kernel and
issued the same commands. Presto! It all worked like it was supposed to, I
was able to format the raid and add it to the /etc/fstab. No problems! So
I've been running the stock kernel ever since...
On further investigation, it seems that Redhat applies some patches to the
kernel that look like they came out of a 2.2.13 pre release kernel.
Specifically, they include a patch in their SRPM called
"raid-2.2.13-B0.gz".
Anyone have any comments or clues? Is 2.2.12 md drive just broken?
