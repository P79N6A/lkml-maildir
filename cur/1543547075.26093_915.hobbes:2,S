VFS isn't really wrong, the problem is that it moved from an almost
single threaded API to a multithreaded API and that development isn't
complete yet. I don't really expect that fs programming becomes easier,
but it should stay sane. For example I want to protect certain state
changes properly and not that insane "check all possible states at all
possible times and before and after every change" what Al is currently
doing in ext2.
bye, Roman
