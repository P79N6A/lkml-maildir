In that case, it's probably the early bootstrap code that runs before the TSC is 
calibrated.  PIT sucks, but it sucks very reliably, so it's a good basis for 
calibrating the other timekeeping devices.  Once you have something better set 
up, you don't need it anymore if you're not doing C-state transitions.
