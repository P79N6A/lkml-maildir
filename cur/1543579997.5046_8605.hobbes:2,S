However, that doesn't fault its concepts and its original goals. This
kind stuff is often more of an implementation and bad abstraction issue than
about faulty design and end goals.

Andrew Morton's patch uses < 10 rescheduling points (maybe less from memory)
and in controlled, focused and logical places. It's certainly not a unmaintainable
mammoth unlike previous attempts, since Riel (many thanks) has massively
cleaned up the VM layer by using more reasonable algorithms, etc...

Which is very good and maintainable with Andrew's patches.

Also very good an useable for many applications short of writting dedicated
code on specialized DSP cards.

Algorithms ? which ones ? VM layer, scheduler ?  It seems there's enough
there in the Linux kernel to start doing interesting stuff, assuming that
there's a large enough media crowd willing to do the userspace programming.

Mean what ? How does that response answer his criticism ?
