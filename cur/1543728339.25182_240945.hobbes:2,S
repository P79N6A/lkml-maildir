BTW, f_pos assignments are non-atomic on IA-32 since it's a 64-bit value.
The file position is protected by the BKL in llseek(), but I do not see any
serialization neither in sys_read() nor in generic_file_read() and other
methods.
Have we accepted that the file position may be corrupted after crossing 2^32
boundary by 2 processes reading in parallel from the same file?
Or am I missing something?
