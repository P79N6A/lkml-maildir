My box came up first time lucky on this release, but I got a new oops:

The box carried on and booted up normally after that and seems otherwise OK.
I'm yet to test this release out more throughly for some other problems I have 
seen recently as they require multiple reboots etc etc, but this one was more 
obvious  :)
