Nope. If you don't just write out a whole new document (slow),
you must be using some sort of internal allocation system and
namespace. You have to update that properly. 120 ms, maybe.
For this mediocre performance, you pay elsewhere... (see below)

You will be reading quite a few notes. Your internal allocation
system and namespace are layered on top of the regular filesystem,
reducing performance. You can't take advantage of a block device
the way a kernel filesystem can.
Look, would you want to mount your $HOME from a loopback file?
How about /tmp or /usr? (and the kernel can even optimize those!)
I went through the O() notation in my response to Viro & Reiser.
It was very bad at least, and quite possibly much worse than I
was able to show.
