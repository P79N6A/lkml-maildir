I've got CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV=y in my .config so I am assuming yes.
The keypresses don't generate the correct characters.  I.e. as far as
I can tell, the 'm' key is Caps Lock, the '9' key is ScrLk, the '0'
key is NumLk, the 'q' key is 'y', the 'w' key is Ctrl, the 'e' key is 
'j' the 'r' key is 'x'.  Etc.  I hope you don't need a complete list!
Thanks,
