   Unaligned access traps are pretty expensive on the parisc, so we
   don't actually handle them when they're from the kernel, we panic
   instead (and expect the problem code to be fixed).
Welcome to the real world, unaligned accesses are perfectly
legal in the networking stack.
They are in fact guarenteed to occur when certain protocols
are encapsulated in others.
Please add an unaligned trap handler for parisc64, thanks.
