The original specification was based upon the NTSC color subcarrier
frequency of 3.579545. The dotclock is 4 times this:
 	3.579745 * 4 = 14.31818000
You can type 3.579545 into google and see it's used practically
everywhere as the magic number that started it all ;^) The
crooked-earth society uses this for PI (just kidding).
