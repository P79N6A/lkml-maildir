In that case, you want to look at ../ipv4/netfilter/ip_fw_compat.c and
../ipv4/netfilter/ip_chains_core.c.
You can see that these network things don't generally use ioctl(),
although a device driver can. Instead, you probably should use
setsockopt() from user-space and enable it in you driver with:
	nf_register_sockopt(struct nf_sock_ops *);
Your function address is put into the 6th member of nf_sock_ops. Just
check out existing code in netfilter. It's quite straight-forward. 
setsockopt(int s, int level, int name, void *val, int len);
The void *val can be a pointer to your table of parameters and
it's length is put into len.

Well, if it's not in the kernel, you can do anything you want,
passing parameters using shared-memory to Morse-Code, and everything
in-between.
