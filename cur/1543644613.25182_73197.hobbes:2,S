It does that for reads.
For writes, however, I see no point in keeping the page lock beyond what is 
required in order to safely copy data from userland. To do so would give 
disastrous performances if somebody was trying to write < page-sized records. 
I belive this is true for all filesystems.
For some reason or another, the buffer stuff needs to re-take the page lock 
when it actually performs the physical commit to disk. NFS doesn't need to do 
this in order to perform an RPC call, so we don't...
Cheers,
