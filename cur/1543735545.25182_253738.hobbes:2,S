I don't think it is related.
some patches in 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 caused the dma failure (for 2.6.9-rc2,
I don't know)
try unapplying the 3 patches above:
+incorrect-pci-interrupt-assignment-on-es7000-for-platform-gsi.patch
+incorrect-pci-interrupt-assignment-on-es7000-for-platform-gsi-fix.patch
+incorrect-pci-interrupt-assignment-on-es7000-for-pin-zero.patch
(in the reverse order :))
that worked for me, currently running
