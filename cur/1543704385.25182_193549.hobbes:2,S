Hi David,
2.6.1-mm4 has a variant of this, limited to bitmaps and using the
comma as the seperator.   See bitmap_parse and bitmap_snprintf in
lib/bitmap.c
Replacing the comma with the underscore and moving the whole shebang
to printf/scanf sounds like a good idea to me.  Printf *should* be
able to manipulate bitmaps just as it does for other basics types
like strings and ints.
Why don't you whip up a patch and see what happens?
Regards,
Joe
