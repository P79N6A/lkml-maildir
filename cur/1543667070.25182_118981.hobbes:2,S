AFAIK, without guarantees.  I used a list from Jamie Lokier and then
went thru bunches of source files & syscalls myself and came up with
these.
There are still some syscall prototypes that are declared as int
instead of long, but I can't fix them tonight (zzz).  Examples:
	sys_sched_setaffinity
		arch/sparc64/, arch/ppc64/, arch/s390x/ (FIX PROTO)
	sys_sched_getaffinity
		arch/sparc64/, arch/ppc64/, arch/s390x/ (FIX PROTO)
	sys_remap_file_pages
		arch/sparc/ (FIX PROTO)
	sys_lookup_dcookie
		arch/sparc64/, arch/ppc64/, arch/parisc/ (FIX PROTO)
That's all that I know of.
