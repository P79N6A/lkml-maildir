Yes and no. That doesn't really work either, for any machine with more
than 4GB of RAM.
We want to find the memory hole (in the low 4GB region), and usually the
e820 memory map should make that all happen properly. What does that
report on this laptop?
This is why we put the memory resources in /proc/iomem, and mark them 
busy: so that the PCI subsystem won't try to allocate PCI memory in the 
RAM (or ACPI reserved) area. The "pci_mem_start" thing is just a point to 
_start_ the allocation, the PCI subsystem still should honor the fact that 
we have memory above it. That's the whole point of doing proper resource 
allocation, after all.
Does this not work, or have you disabled e820 for some reason?
