Hi,
        I am following the access beyond end of device thread and trying to
decide what setup to use on the next configs I have to build. 
I noticed (please correct me if I am wrong) that some systems did not appear in
messages on this topic...
        So I have the following Qs:
        Did anyone see any access beyond end of device errors on non-Intel x86?
        Did anyone see any access beyond end of device errors on non-Intel
platforms (alpha, sparc)?
        Any answers are appreciated. 
        Thanks in advance.
