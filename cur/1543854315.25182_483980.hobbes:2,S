I am not seeing this.
Let's assume sp->completed starts out zero.
o	CPU 0 starts executing xxx_read_lock(), but is interrupted
	(or whatever) just before the atomic_inc().  Upon return,
	it will increment sp->ctr[0].
o	CPU 1 executes synchronize_xxx() to completion, which it
	can because CPU 0 has not yet incremented the counter.
	It waited on sp->ctr[0], and incremented sp->completed to 1.
o	CPU 0 returns from interrupt and completes xxx_read_lock(),
	but has incremented sp->ctr[0].
o	CPU 0 continues into its critical section, picking up a
	pointer to an xxx-protected data structure (or, in Jens's
	case starting an xxx-protected I/O).
o	CPU 1 executes another synchronize_xxx().  This completes
	immediately because it is waiting for sp->ctr[1] to go
	to zero, but CPU 0 incremented sp->ctr[0].  (Right?)
o	CPU 1 continues, either freeing a data structure while
	CPU 0 is still referencing it, or, in Jens's case, completing
	an I/O barrier while there is still outstanding I/O.
Or am I missing something?
						Thanx, Paul
