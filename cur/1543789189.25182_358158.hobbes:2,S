Yes I did, on a null block driver[1], this optimization gets about
2% improvement.  The reasoning is that for example, user submits
100,000 I/O per second, we only need to update the stats per jiffies.
With latest kernel have 250 Hz as default.  It's 250 updates versus
100,000 updates (with 99,750 updates of adding zero).  I see that the
condition is well worth it.  The address calculation for per cpu disk
stats has lots of indirection and index calculation.  Compiler generates
lots of code just for address calculation.

[1] this driver completes an I/O request as soon as it enters block queue.
