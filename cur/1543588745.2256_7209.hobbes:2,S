Hi folks,
I was looking at linux/drivers/Makefile and noticed that "sound" (among
others) was always put into the kernel whether it was configured on or
not.  Is there some reason for this?
Also, in linux/Rules.make, "fastdep:" is making dependancies on
"ALL_SUB_DIRS" which is "subdir-y", "subdir-m", "subdir-n" and
"subdir-", why is this?  It makes more sense that it just make
dependancies for "subdir-y" and "subdir-m" as the rest don't matter.
If these types of things are errors, I can make a patchfile, just let me
know what the proper behavior is.
Thanks,
-Jeff
