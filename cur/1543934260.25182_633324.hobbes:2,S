We've got that already, it's called 'srcversion', and it's a CRC32
IIRC after some limited parsing to let it ignore whitspace changes and
comment changes only.  
$ modinfo dell_rbu | grep version
version:        3.2
srcversion:     1D4815D7D6FBEE6612F3C18
DKMS uses the srcversion if present recognize an exact match.
srcversions can't be tested for anything <> though, only =.
DKMS also uses the version field as supplied by MODULE_VERSION() to
try to determine older-vs-newer modules.  On occasion we've had to
release updated "fixed" kernel modules, in which case we bump the
value in MODULE_VERSION() slightly (typically append .1 or something
similar) so the "fixed" module version compares higher.  Such version
fields aren't generally used with stock kernel.org kernels (where
users can be expected to upgrade to a later stock kernel), but for
users of a distro kernel where we need to fix a module without forcing
the user to upgrade the whole kernel.
