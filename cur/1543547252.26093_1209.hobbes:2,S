Actually, this was a trick question, sorry :)
While it may be feasible with LILO, SILO, and MILO, already a TFTP boot
(as supportd by GRUB, Etherboot, netboot, etc.) would cause problems
(okay, you could pass the address to the kernel, then download the file
with TFTP, and extract the config section).
LOADLIN would be similar, because the file system containing the kernel
may not even be mounted under Linux.
Another nasty case would be ArLo, which may load the kernel from a RAM
disk, which is destroyed in the process. There, you'd have to find out
where the kernel originally came from (i.e. Compact Flash or
serial/IrDA port).
