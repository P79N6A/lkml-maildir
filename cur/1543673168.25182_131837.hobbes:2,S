AFAIK Speedstep should always work on P4M systems, so it's worth a try.

That's pretty bizzarre, I agree :-)
Probably it's an autocorrelation with a sliding offset.  I'd guess that the 
reason the buzz starts at 500Hz and sweeps up is that if the frequency is 
below 500Hz you don't hear it.  Maybe the RAM starts sucking more power as 
the cache hit ratio drops...
