Perhaps pointer to Documentation/power/drivers-testing.txt would be
useful here?

If you add copyright, maybe specify license, too? (", GPL" should be enough).

Hmm, actually it is nice to mix STR + STD, too... and not sure if
"many" is right word... It sounds scary :-).

Actually, those debugging instructions look really cool. Perhaps we
should split them into separate file, as it is also interesting for
users trying to get suspend working on their machine?

Maybe reorder the tests so that poor submitter will not have to do 3
kernel compiles?
