Hello,
I 've got a light ISA Adaptec "AVA" SCSI2 card that was 
included in the scanner package i bought, and it is biosless. 
I don't mind since i boot on IDE hard-drive.
The problem is that my 2.0.36 kernel does not find it.
I'm quite familiar with kernel compilation, but the AHA15xx
module doesn't work. 
I was told to give arguments to kernel
about location of the AVA card (i.e: Base addr, irq, parity...)
with LILO.
Here is my problem : 
i do not find any information in books nor in HOWTOs
about that ! 
Thank you for your help !
Ben
