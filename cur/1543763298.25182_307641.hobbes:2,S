You risk nothing. APIs in linux change incrementally and if kernel hackers do 
want to drop support for an api, they're very vocal about it and it doesn't 
concern stuff that can blow up your computer (see oss vs. alsa).

Like I've said, you're unable to break your system this way. And I don't see 
any point in LFS suggesting using raw kernel headers to compile glibc (no you 
*can't* screw up your system by using llh unless I specifically switch ioctls 
so apps remove files instead of opening them; I just can't see any 
possibility to do it by accident).
And I'll add an entry to the llh FAQ to clear this matter up.
