lcc isn't really something I want to use, since the license is so strange, 
and thus can't be improved upon if there are issues with it.
Some people have used the Intel compiler - which obviously also cannot be
improved upon, but which is likely to start off pretty good. I don't
really want to use it myself - what I'd really like to see is gcc
splitting up just the C compiler as a separate project with more attention
to size and speed.
