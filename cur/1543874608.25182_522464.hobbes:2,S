Hi!
I'd like to get stable major number for mmc subsystem. Relying on
dynamic major for mmc is nasty, as it means that udev is neccessary on
the machine.
179 block       MMC block devices
                  0 = /dev/mmcblk0      First SD/MMC card
                  1 = /dev/mmcblk0p1    First partition on first MMC card
                  8 = /dev/mmcblk1      Second SD/MMC card
                    ...
Thanks,
									Pavel
