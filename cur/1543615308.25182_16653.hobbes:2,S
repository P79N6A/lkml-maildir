Eric I see your point now. But stop me if I don't get the idea behind 
your autoconfigurator :
Guessing the hardware configuration is done in order to ease the whole 
configuration process. After polishing the configuration - no need for 
root priviledge - the user start the build process that doesn't need 
root priviledge either.
But when the user gets the resulting kernel how does (s)he avoid suing 
to root in order to *install* it and its modules ?
I'm not familiar with people configuring and compiling kernels for 
pleasure. They usually want to boot it...
Your whole point here is not to avoid several su instead of 1?
LB.
