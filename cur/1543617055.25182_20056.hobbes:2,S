	This does not affect the patch that I posted, but I wish to
update one remark that I made:

	I must apologize for suggesting that that was another loop.c
bug.  It turns out that this is a devfsd quirk that disappeared when I
updated to the latest devfsd (it has to do with recent kernels
using a different test to determine which processes are children of
devfsd).
