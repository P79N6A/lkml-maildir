Are there any cases when the last_written size is really what's wanted,
rather than the capacity? Such as unclosed multi-session iso9660, ufs, or
whatever else I'm ignoring?

For a read-only access, I think the size is what's written, while for
writing it's the physical size, I think. Does it need to be as complex as
having the order depend on the access mode? It seems that a size of zero
is correct for a read access to an unwritten media.
