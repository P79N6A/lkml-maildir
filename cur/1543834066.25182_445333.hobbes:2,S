In this particular case, it's only used on the resume path, which I'm 
guessing would not lead to IO recursion.  There doesn't seem to be any 
particular reason for this to be NOFAIL though (but I haven't really 
analyzed it).
There don't appear to be any memory allocations on the IO path; they're 
all in setup code.
