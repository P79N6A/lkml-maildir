You should leave the usb_ep_autoconfig() as is, i.e. do not introduce
any new parameters to it.

Why have you submitted the limited driver then? You should test
the driver with all gadgets. Also, please report  how it works
in DMA and PIO modes. And what transfer rate the driver achives
in both modes.

Probably no, but technically there is no reason to not support
all gadgets.
BTW, I suggest that you wait until PXA3XX arch support will be
merged into mainline kernel, then, pxa27x_udc-compatible driver
will probably be submitted too. Taking into account that
pxa27_udc have not been merged for years, I think extra
2-3 month is ok.
