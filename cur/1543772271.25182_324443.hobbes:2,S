Your workaround does indeed seem to work around the problem.
I can rip tracks from a cd now and I don't get a lock up
anymore.
But the first time I do something with the CD I get this...
warning: many lost ticks.
Your time source seems to be instable or some driver is hogging interupts.
rip __do_softirq+0x48/0xb0
Falling back to HPET
 From then on I'm guessing I'm using the HPET and I don't
get any more of these warnings.
I did check on DMA on for the device. I can't get it
to support DMA...
root@mail:/root# hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  setting using_dma to 1 (on)
  HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
  using_dma    =  0 (off)
I don't know what else to "fiddle" with to get it working. My guess is 
that DMA is not currently supported at all for the chipset/motherboard
I have. (As I said before, lspci seems to indicate that a lot of stuff
on this motherboard is "unknown" hardware; would be nice to get it
"known" but I don't know how. I can only be somebody's guinea pig for
patches ;-) Or maybe I am missing some trick to enabling DMA? I have
it enabled by default in my kernel .config
Anyhow, thanks for the work around. I can at least use my burner now.
Though I suspect you want a "real" fix sometime as for why the HPET
tick obtained a 0 value.  If you want me to test another patch
towards this goal just let me know.
