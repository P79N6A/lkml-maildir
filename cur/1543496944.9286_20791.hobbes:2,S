More like 100,000 lines+. But, I'm not sure what will wind up in Linux.
There are two directory formats (old/new) and only one should go into Linux.
This should save about 10K. Other stuff is on the side like the extended
attributes and they really don't impact the main code.
Why do lines of code restrict what makes an fs ideal for an appliance or desktop?
