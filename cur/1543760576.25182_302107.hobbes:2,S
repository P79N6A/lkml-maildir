I think it will confuse scripts which expect something local in the 4th 
field. I confess that I have such, and that field is turned into a 
directory name during builds, so test results are saved in a proper 
place. I think vendors and people who care will just keep three digits, 
and those who want the last can make their EXTRAVERSION
    2.Joes_Bar_&_Grill_486
or whatever is needed.
Add to that the confusion of having mainline releases
   2.6.x.LOCAL
and stable be
   2.6.x.y.LOCAL
and you really make work for people who do things with scripts. This is 
probably not an issue for humans, and people could program around it, 
but I think it's a solution to a non-problem. Vendors will have the 
-stable and their own patches, so they probably will only keep three 
fields anyway.
And don't even suggest tell Linus to start calling mainline releases 
2.6.x.0 because that would probably break even more things.
Leave well enough alone!
