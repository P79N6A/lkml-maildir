But how does that improve performance before untouched RAM, (496788 in this
example), is exhausted?
In normal use, (almost always CPU bound), I've honestly never noticed any
performance gain from having swap configured.  I must admit I haven't put
a lot of effort recently in to looking at this, but I have never been able
to reproduce these 'swap increases performance even with untouched RAM'
claims.
