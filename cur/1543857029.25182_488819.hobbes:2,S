if it had only been the messages i wouldnt have complained.
the thing is, when i get these messages, the app provoking them acts
very strange, and in some cases, my system simply hardlocks.
and i am very very sure its because of this, i can run with the kernel
(atleast with rc5 i had that long) for 10 days, and then chroot in, run
the 32bit apps, and within hours of using, hardlock.
wine seems to be worst at provoking hardlock, however i encountered one
i am sure was caused by java(the 32bit one inside chroot).
as i said in my post yesterday, my chroot doesent have access to my vfat
partitions, so i dont believe thats it.
