Very Cool!

Hmmm. While we do have suspend and resume functions for the timekeeping
core, I'm not sure if suspend and resume are necessary for each struct
clocksource since state changes are only allowed inside the callback
hook.  That probably should be better documented. :)
Some specific hardware that might provide a clocksource interface may
need suspend/resume hooks (like the PIT, for example), but in my mind
that would be done independently from the clocksource code.
But maybe I'm not quite grasping what you're suggesting, so feel free to
clarify with maybe an example of its use and I'll re-think it.
Thanks for the code review and patches! I really appreciate it!
