This one has been reported before.
n_tty_receive_buf() puts a character into the tty queue and
then calls con_flush_chars(), which touches tty->driver_data.
Problem is, there's a window between these two operations where the
device can be closed (especially if the char is "^D"!), and con_close()
will zero out tty->driver_data.  Hence null pointer deref.
I don't really believe this explanation, because the timing's
wrong - the reader isn't woken until after the flush is called.
Hence it'll be very difficult to actually trigger this race.
It's probably something else.  But a bit more sticking plaster
should make it appear to be fixed:
