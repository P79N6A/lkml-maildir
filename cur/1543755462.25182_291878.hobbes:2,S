There is another problem with approach one. Assuming all 2^MAX_ORDER pages
have been zeroed and in USERZERO pool and there are no other free pages,
an allocation for the USERRCLM pool would search all the other pools
before finding the zerod pages. This could really slow things up but it is
not a problem approach two suffers from.

Your guess is as good as mine :) . I am fairly sure the allocator is
somewhere in Andrew's list of patches to look at to consider for inclusion
into -mm so I suppose it'll get a spin in that tree when he feels it's
ready.
