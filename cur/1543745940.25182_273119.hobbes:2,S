Hi,
I'm writing a driver for a PCI-based USB controller. The work is almost
done but a few days ago something very ugly happened. I've tried to
pinpoint the problem but everything is so simple and clear to be
wrong... I really hope that someone can help me!
OK, here's the problem:
I'm using kernel 2.6.8 on an i386 arch. I want to allocate region 2 of
my PCI board. Here's the output of lspci:
0000:00:0e.0 Bridge: PLX Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 5406 (rev 0b)
        Subsystem: PLX Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 9054

        Region 2: I/O ports at e800 [size=256]
        Region 3: Memory at df000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
[size=1M]

As you can see, region 2 begins at e800 and extends up to e8ff.
When I try to claim the region, I get wrong start-end-length numbers.
I've written something simple to demonstrate this fact:
for(pci_region=0; pci_region < PCI_ROM_RESOURCE; pci_region++){  
	resource_start = pci_resource_start (dev, pci_region);
	resource_end = pci_resource_end (dev,pci_region);
	printk (KERN_DEBUG "region:%d start:%lx, end:%lx -  ", pci_region,
resource_start, resource_end);
	len = pci_resource_len (dev, pci_region);
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "length:%lx\n", len);
}
Where "dev" is a pointer to a pci device of course.
So here's what I get by running this code:
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 9 for device 0000:00:0e.0
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: region:0	start:0, end:0 -  <7>length:0
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: region:1	start:df1000ff, end:200 -
<7>length:20f00102
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: region:2	start:e4ff, end:101 -
<7>length:ffff1c03
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: region:3	start:e8ff, end:101 -
<7>length:ffff1803
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: region:4	start:df0fffff, end:200 -
<7>length:20f00202
Nov 21 16:28:56 naousa kernel: region:5^Istart:0, end:0 -  <7>length:0
As you can see, what "start" claims to be is in reality the end of each
region, and "end", "length" are nonsense...
Any ideas? Is this something typical???
I would appreciate any help, please CC me personally as I'm not yet
subscribed to the list, or find me at the linux-usb-devel list.
Thanx in advance,
