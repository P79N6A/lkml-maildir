As mentioned in another thread, we are building a file server with 3ware 
IDE RAID.
At the moment, we plan to get a 6800 (32-bit PCI).  If we add 7800's 
(64-bit PCI) or some other 3ware card later, will the driver correctly 
configure them all?  IOW, if I have
32-bit card in 32-bit slot,
32-bit card in 64-bit slot,
64-bit card in 32-bit slot, and
64-bit card in 64-bit slot
all using the same driver, will Linux correctly see 3 32-bit connections 
and one 64-bit?  If this is a driver-level issue, does at least the 3ware 
driver handle this correctly?
Thanks,
