Yes, but that was just a test patch to test my suspicions about why
a UP_APIC kernel failed on an SMP K7 box. (CPU #1 was BSP and was
programmed with CPU #0's local APIC ID.)
I assume that an SMP machine once booted by the BIOS will have
unique local APIC IDs. They're typically either hardwired or programmed
by the BIOS. If the MP table then disagrees with what's in the
CPUs' local APIC IDs, who do you trust: the MP table or the CPUs?
I personally would trust the CPUs and leave the local APIC IDs alone,
in particular since writing to them always risks collisions, especially
in the UP-kernel-on-SMP-HW case.
So I think the BUG should be a warning, but we shouldn't clobber APIC_ID.
