    By "GNU" you mean the Hurd?
GNU means the entire system that we set out from the beginning to
develop.  The Hurd is just one piece of GNU--it is the upper layer of
the kernel.
				That's not nice at all. Just where
    did you get your network stack from? How about the bulk of the
    hardware drivers?
The TCP/IP implementation in the Hurd comes from Linux, but the Hurd
as a whole is very different from Linux.  (There are no drivers in the
Hurd.)
Linux is a small part of the GNU/Linux system, but there are
various reasons to call it "GNU/Linux" than just "GNU".  See
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#justgnu.
    So Freax is our kernel, and Linux is the OS.
Anyone for renaming this list to freax@vger.kernel.org?
