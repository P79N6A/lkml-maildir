Nobody has answered a basic concern:
Why does Win2k work while Linux does not?
We already know that MiciSoft sometimes helps make stupid standards like P&P
ISA cards and then writes drivers for them.  Something that is hard to do for
any _sane_ developers who did not help make the stupid "standard".
Having said that, if anybody has a technical answer for Ronald please give it
to him.  He says:
My systems ARE FINE BECAUSE Win2k runs on them.  This deserves a direct
technical answer if anybody has one.
