Hi,
I have some questions regarding the page descriptors  in the linux kernel with
discontig memory support. 
According to my understanding memory for page descriptors is allocated from
the
bootmem allocator and that for pg_dat_t structure comes from the
node_remap_start addr. 
So the first question is, does the memory used by bootmem allocator & this
pg_dat_t also have page descriptors. 
In short if i walk all the pfn's in each pg_dat_t will i ever come across the
memory used by page_descriptors and pg_dat_t.
Thanks for giving your attention. 
Regards,
Xeon
