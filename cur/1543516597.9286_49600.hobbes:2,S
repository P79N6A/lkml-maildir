Here's another data point: I tried changing the FIFO trigger in the
serial driver from 8 to 1.  It makes a huge difference at 57600.  With
the trigger at 8, I get about 90% bad packets from the camera.  But with 
it set at 1, I only get about 10% bad packets.  At 115200, though, it's
nearly 100% bad packets regardless of the trigger setting.
