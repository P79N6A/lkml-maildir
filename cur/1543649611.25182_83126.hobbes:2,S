OK, so I assume what's happening here is that the entire uncompressed
kernel fits into 40% of your memory.
So we see 4 seconds user time from doing the gzip decompression
and three seconds system time; a little from reading the
tarball and most of it is creating a ton of dirty pagecache.
But most of the real cost has not been measured: getting that
dirty pagecache onto disk.  It has to happen sometime...
If you include a "sync" in the timing then you'll see the
benefit from the Orlov allocator.  You'll get that kernel
tree onto disk in half the time.
