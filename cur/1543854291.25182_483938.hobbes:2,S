   The fasteoi flow seem to only had been used for x86 IOAPIC in the RT patch 
only *before* PPC took to using them in the mainline...

    Not all of them. This could be customized on type-by-type basis. I.e. we 
could call eoi() instead of ack() for fasteoi chips without having to resort 
to the duplicated ack/eoi handlers.
