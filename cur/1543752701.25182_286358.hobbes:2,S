I don't see any particular need to support generation of this
instruction coding.  Feeding the output of the disassembler back to the
assembler won't generate the same encodings for many instructions, eg.
there are two ways to encode mov %eax,%ebx (and some people even use
the two reg->reg move encodings to hide messages in code).  Another
example is that the assembler chooses the smallest immediate or
displacement encoding.

Huh?  The assembler will warn about this construct, and we certainly
should continue to warn, so that people who meant to write
"mov (,%esi,2),%eax" get a clue.
