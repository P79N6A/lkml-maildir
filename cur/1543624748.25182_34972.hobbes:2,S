Ok! I downloaded it, and patched the kernel. Although I don't have a
160gig drive yet (was waiting for backport), the linux 2.2.21rc2 with
the pre2 ide patch (latest and greatest) booted ok and hasn't crashed.
I'll need to try it on a new 160 gig drive sometime.
Hmmm.  Hope consideration is given to back port this patch to 2.2.x.
