I have bind-mounted / on /net/blabla
I tried two experiments:
	mounting something under / and looking for it under /net/blabla
	mounting something under /net/blabla and looking for it under /
The experiment was done with bind mounts and by mounting a USB stick
(/dev/sdb1) and there was no auto propagation of mounts.
(2.6.12-rc6)
How can a leaf dir suddenly become non-leaf by a mount without an explicit
mount command?
