Subject: "kaweth" usb ethernet driver in 2.4?

I'm wondering about the status of the "kaweth" Kawasaki LSI KL5KUSB100
USB to Ethernet Controller driver for 2.4.  According to
http://www.hiru.aoba.yokohama.jp/
%7eura/USB/usbether.html, this chipset
is used in the 3Com USB Network Adapter, Linksys USB10T, D-Link DSB-650,
SMC 2102USB, Netgear EA101, and a few other USB ethernet adapters.
The driver is included with the USB stuff for 2.2, but not in 2.4.
It also doesn't seem to work in 2.2.  :)  The original development of
this driver was going on at 
http://drivers.rd.ilan.net/kaweth/
 but there
have been no updates for quite some time.
Donald Becker had a driver at one point as well, and there's still a
link at 
http://www.scyld.com/usb/ethernet.html,
 but the link is broken
now, and I don't have the code.
I have one of these beasts, and I'd like to get it working - I haven't
done any USB _or_ ethernet work for Linux, so it'll be an uphill climb
fro me.  Anybody else have one, and have some time to collaborate?  :) 
I have some of the chipset documentation, too, FWIW.
Thanks,
-Eric
