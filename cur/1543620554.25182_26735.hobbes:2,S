I agree that it should not split ios, but it should not needlessly limit 
the size of them either -- that choice should be left to individual 
drivers.

Yup.  What we need is an interface for getting the max size of an io -- 
I can see this being needed for filesystems, char devices, network drivers, 
basically anything that we can do aio/"direct" io on.  Given that, I can 
put the split / pipelining code into the generic layer.
