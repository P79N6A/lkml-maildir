Okay how to explain this: 
I have A TView 99 cph060 TV Tuner Card on a Presario 5834 when I am
using my Windows HDD It works with the software provided (Damn
Proprietary Software). But If I reboot without turning on a Tuner Card
Program It doesn't catch any signals and all I get is snow. I am
regularly using Kernel v. 2.4.18 but it also happens in 2.5.33 
I am sorry if I didn't explain this well If any information is needed
please let me know
