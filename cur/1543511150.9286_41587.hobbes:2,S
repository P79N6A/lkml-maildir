Right, and as I trust the IDE driver to do this right, I expect it 
to work.
For example: 
To get some extra speed out of a drive, some manufacturers give the
interrupt a few microseconds earlier than when the data is fully
available. With faster and faster hardware, it becomes possible to
empty the buffer before it is fully available.... Data corruption. Now
by sharing the interrupt, the OTHER drive may be interrupting, and the
processor gets that few microsecond lead.... 
When I was on the same room with the hardware guy, we had the rule:
"if it's untested it won't work". Well if Abit tested that board with
NT, its drive subsystem probably didn't get a workout comparable with
what it's getting from Linux. So: "It's untested and may not work". 
I'm not saying that that's what is going on, but a hardware problem
like that could sure be possible. 
Tell me. Is the Linux serial driver reliable? I'm seeing
datacorruption. That's for sure. Ok. There is a neato, new PCI serial
chip involved. The chip looks reliable to me. The driver looks
reliable to me. Where is the data getting corrupted? Anyway: Something
to do for today...
