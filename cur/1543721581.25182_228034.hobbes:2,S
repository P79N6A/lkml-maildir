Part of the fix for these issues with Irix NFS was version 2
directories in XFS, this made directory offsets in XFS into
real offsets rather than 64 bit hash values.
If your filesystem is old enough, it will have version 1
directories - and the only conversion process is to do
a dump/mkfs/restore.
xfs_growfs -n /mntpnt will report the directory version
as naming=1 or naming=2 if I recall correctly.
