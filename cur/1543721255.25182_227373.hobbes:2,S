This seems perhaps quite high? On occasion I have to use a configuration
where the network interface is configured by DHCP. When I take the
interface down (ifdown eth0) but forget to assign it its usual network
address (when changing location to another network) some interaction
with the still running DHCP client (pump) makes my laptop crawl just like
you describe. So if all other suggested options fail, you might want to
check if you maybe have such a runaway DHCP client causing havoc.
