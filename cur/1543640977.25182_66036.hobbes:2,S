hi
My kernel is 2.4.16.
when I use th smartbit test device to test the
performance of eepro100 driver 1.23b version.
I test it on a intel s220 server with two intel
82550PM chip network interface.The data flow 
generated by smartbit device come into the NIC 1 and
come out from NIC 2.
when the data load is 25% of
100Mbps,bi-directional,64byte frame size,and the test
duration is 60 second,the test result display that
serious packet loss take place. when the duration
decrease to 10 second,the other test condition matain
unchanged,no packet losss.
I wonder whether the memory is out of use.
I want to know why this happen? and how to solve it ?
Thanks a lot
