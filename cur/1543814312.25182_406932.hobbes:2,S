Where does it say that the southbridge is 35 and 37 at the same time? (The 
only thing that's different between the two lspci lines is the vtABCD 
number...)
Or it looks like there's another of these "strange" cases:
0000:00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C598/694x [Apollo 
MVP3/Pro133x AGP]
0000:00:07.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C596 ISA [Mobile South]
