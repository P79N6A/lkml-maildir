How do normal users get to create/maintain large files (i.e. >2G) in Linux
2.4 on i386?
The root user can make filesize unlimited but a non-root user cannot.  They
come up with the same limits in both tcsh and bash (i.e. filesize
1048576 kbytes or 0x40000000)
I can't seem to find where this number comes from anywhere -- either in
glibc-2.2.1 or the kernel.   getrlimit64 returns it.
I can't make all my users root users!!!  Can anybody help?
