If I understand this, you are decreasing the priority of a task that is
running as it consumes its slice.  In the current way of doing things
this happens and is noticed when the scheduler gets called.  A task can
loose its place by being preempted by some quick I/O bound task.  I.e. A
and B are cpu hogs with A having the cpu, if task Z comes along and runs
for 100 micro seconds, A finds itself replace by B, where as if Z does
not come along, A will complete its slice.  It seems to me that A should
be first in line after Z and not bumped just because it has used some of
its slice.  This would argue for priority being set at slice renewal
time and left alone until the task blocks or completes its slice.
