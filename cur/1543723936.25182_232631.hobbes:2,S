Great! I am still somewhat confused why it started locking up with sysfs
patch - even before sunzilog was calling serio_register_port with interrupts
off and serio core was downing it's serio_sem as the very first thing. Since
at the time sunzilog registers its ports no serio drivers have been registered
yet, effectively the only change introduced by sysfs patch is the call to
device_register which takes bus' subsystem rwsem and there really should not
be any congestion.
Maybe rwsems can not be touched with interrupts off? Sparc only? Everywhere?
(I know that you should not normally call functions that may sleep with
interrupts off).
