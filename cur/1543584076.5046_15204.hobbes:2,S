Ok!
I've removed all nis reference in /etc/nsswitch.conf and now there are no
more hangs...I have to admit, learning that thew execution process of tar
is somehow related to nis,portmap is a little weird :) (but that's part of

Does anyone think that this kind of problem must be documentated in
the kernel documentation?
