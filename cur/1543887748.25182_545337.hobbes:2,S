Correct.

I never said it was breaking machines, just that it was accessing
arbitrary I/O ports.
This was already discussed with the driver's author (Hans de Goede,
Cc'd) and I think we agreed on the principle, but it didn't happen yet.
This device only exists on Abit motherboards so it would be easy enough
to check the DMI vendor. A more detailed white list is also possible,
but I'm not insisting on it.
The driver could also be made to depend on X86, as this is the only
architecture where it is useful.
Hans, can you please submit a patch doing this?
Thanks,
