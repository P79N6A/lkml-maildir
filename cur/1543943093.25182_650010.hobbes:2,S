Yes, I was trying to pull Kumar's tree for a while.  I still am doing so,
but it's presently 6.5MB of conflicts, so I'll give up on that ;)
In theory, your 2.6.x+1 material shold be ready to go well in advance of
the 2.6.x release day (hah), so it'd be good if it could be in Paul's tree
during 2.6.x's late -rc's.
