I've got the same problem with my Sony Vaio picturebook PCG-C1VE.
Basicaly after echo 3 >/proc/acpi/sleep laptop turns off instantly. It is dead 
afterwards. It mean that i have to take battery out and stick it in after a 
while to be able to turn it on :/
I don't know why i am not able to suspend this laptop, maybe it lacks such 
facility. Anyway, under windows ME i've been able to do that.
Thanks.
