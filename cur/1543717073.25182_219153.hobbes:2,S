Bob, Alex,
(or anybody else with a SIS-961 that now requires acpi=noirq),
I need some info to find out why your system recently broke.
Please open a bug here and attach the info,
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
or just e-mail it to me and I'll open a bug for you.
Need the complete dmesg and /proc/interrupt from the most recent ACPI
enabled kernel that worked properly -- I guess -bk6 worked okay?
Any chance you can boot with "debug" and capture the console messages
from the failure?  If no, then the complete dmesg of the latest kernel
with "acpi=noirq" is the next best thing.
output from lspci -vv
output acpidmp available in /usr/sbin/, or in pmtools:

thanks,

ps. would also be good to verify you're running an up-to-date BIOS.
pps. taking a wild guess, can you try backing out this patch?
