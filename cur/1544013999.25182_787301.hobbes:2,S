This line is not accidental nor casually written: the two statements are deliberately entwined.  It is a succint complaint against the vagaries of vmalloc.
So this patch is a messup, not a cleanup.
But it's really upset me because it is lazy and timid: and too much kernel code is becoming mired in such scars.  Instead of "how do I kill this warning and get it in the merge window" you should be thinking "how do I make the kernel better", and "I wonder if vmalloc still has this problem"...
And I so look forward to the warm fuzzies I get when applying a real cleanup patch.
Thanks,
Rusty.
