This should be implemented like "Library routines" and only added if such 
a SCSI driver module is actually selected. Why can't it at least be a 
visible option in the menu? (Although even then it looks like it's 
impossible to disable).
Why does ATA select SCSI anyway? Surely PATA doesn't require it?
