I've been doing some work on the Initio 9100UW SCSI driver that is
distributed with 2.4.0. I've fixed a couple of bugs and added /proc
support to my copy of the source.
Is there an active maintainer of this driver at present? 
Is there anything that tells what to do to add support for the new
error handling code so it doesn't use scsi_old.c any more?
I'm reading this via fa.linux.kernel so should pick up replies that way
but email is fine too.
