yes.
first, there's the obvious -- narrow can support 8 IDs, wide can
support 16 IDs.  remember your host adapter takes an ID too.
second, there is cabling limits.  there is a maximum pysical scsi bus
length and minimum drop physical spacing.  these limits get worse as
speed and number of devices increases.  the upshot is that UW can only
handle 6 or so items.

maybe it's a cable length/drop spacing/termination/bus speed issue.
most scsi problems seem to fall under that category.
