There are two threads where this mistake is made.
One is used to trigger expire events for all automounted filesystems
which happen all the time since I need to run the expire to check if
anything is mounted and whether it needs to be umounted. The alarm
handler sleeps on a condition until the alarm list in not empty and then
sleeps on a condition until the next alarm in the list expires or an
alarm is added to the list, in which case it then checks the list again.
Since the autofs timeout granularity is one second this is a problem and
will be fixed. This isn't the source of the problem that's been
reported.
The second is the state queue handler which runs tasks such as expires,
map re-reads, shutdowns etc. for all automounted filesystems. While the
check interval could be longer it causes autofs to be slugish in
situations such as shutdowns where there are a largish number of mounts
present and I need to cancel such things as expires and the like. It's
possible I could improve this but, in fact, once the timespec is set
correctly as Ingo suggests it works fine and uses very little resource.
