No - C2 evaluation has not been done for almost 3 years. That makes it
impossible to get a C2 evaluation.

Bullshit - NO OS is C2 anymore. The last certification was given to MS for
NT 4 - about 3 years ago. NONE of the current systems are C2. The best you
can get is "C2 like capability", and that is not a verified operation. And
"C2 like capability" Linux does just as well as M$. Are the log files as
pretty as would be desired? No. But they are acceptable for all US usage
where a UNIX system is acceptable. (And don't even try to claim M$ produces
a secured box... I haven't even been able to find the "trusted facility 
manual" for the released systems... which is a requirement for operation.

I don't know, but I hope so. (2.7 maybe?)

These are also the same people that will not (or should not) accept laptops in
their environement.
