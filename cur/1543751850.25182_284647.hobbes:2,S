Last time I checked with IBM's lawyers, they were not interested in doing
so.  Nonetheless, you are correct, non-GPL use of RCU would require a
conversation with IBM.  And in fact the five relevant patents (one lapsed)
are called out in Documentation/RCU/RTFP.txt.  The four non-lapsed patents
are called out as "contributed under GPL", so I think that we are covered.
