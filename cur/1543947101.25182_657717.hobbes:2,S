The immediate symptom was that we have a page table at the address we
are doing the DMI probe.  Xen does not allow pages tables to be mapped
read-write so early_ioremap get into trouble.
We have a mystery:
- Why did the Xen domain builder or the linux kernel use 0xf0000 - 0x10000
  for a page table.
  It should be possible to instrument the early linux page allocation
  and see what page pages linux is using to see who is doing weird
  things.
We have possible solutions.
- Add a read-only flag to early_ioremap for use by our table scans.
- Don't do a DMI scan in the case of Xen.
- Fix the Xen domain builder.
My inclination is that we disable the fruitless DMI scan in the case
Xen, or we get the Xen domain builder fixed.
If Xen is going to increasingly look like a normal X86 BIOS we should
let the DMI scan run and be put the burden on Xen to keep things
looking like a normal x86 machine.  If Xen is not going to look more
like a normal x86 machine we can say oh, that is nice, it's Xen so
don't bother doing things that will cause problems.
In this case can we confirm that the domain builder is using those
early 64k as pages for a page table, and then educate it that not
allowing OS access to those pages is a little silly.
All of that said.  For DMI tables other early tables we should not
be writing to them anyway so learning to use read-only maps may be
the right solution.  If the reason Xen was complaining was that
we were accessing an area that was not page tables but instead
should only be mapped read-only I would have a lot of sympathy
with that.  As mapping areas that are architecturally ROMs read-write
is silly.
So guys can you please finish the root cause and really see why there
is a page table page at in 64K ROM BIOS area?
