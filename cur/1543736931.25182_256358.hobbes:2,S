Since they are hiring as many top Linux folks as possible, and they have 
invested their entire future in Linux, I think
their actions speak so loud, it doesn't matter what your hearing from 
them. Novell's position (from my experience)
it that they will take whatever steps they feel necessary to protect 
their circle (as evidenced by an illegal search of
my home by Novell Security Employees (not law enforcement 8 Novell 
employees and a sheriff) ) along with spending
17 million dollars in litigation costs to keep me out of the computer 
business for almost 4 years by crushing me, my
family, and any business I tried to start, and ruining my life and my 
marriage with my previous wife of 24 years).
If you are in their circle, they will fight for you to the death, and 
breaking the rules doesn't bother them.
If you are outside their circle ........ you should feel very safe and 
comfortable.
Linux is in their circle at present. I think you should weigh the 
options and make the appropriate decisions
when choosing to deal with them.
