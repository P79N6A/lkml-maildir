I won't tell you that.
I'd say that with a linux driver, the job isn't done it "works", but
rather the job is done when it "is merged".
Once it is merged, it will mostly be updated along with the rest of
the kernel, and if it breaks silently, there is probably someone
available who can fix it.
I think we should frown on out-of-tree drivers nearly as much as
closed-source drivers.
