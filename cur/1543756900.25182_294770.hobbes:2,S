A significant portion of the operations reside in the Adapter Firmware,
the driver report is essentially telling us the Adapter is locking up.
In the Adaptec branch of the driver there is an AAC_DETAILED_STATUS_INFO
manifest in aacraid.h that would enable firmware prints. The Firmware
that exists in the ROMB occasionally reports conditions via that
channel. The in-box driver has this debug channel turned on by default.
Sometimes this can be used to isolate the condition of failure down.
The logs supplied started with the driver report that the Adapter was
hung, messages prior to that would contain the firmware prints.

> Then turn off both read and write cache on the card ...
We've tried with no cache and we had multiple failures over the weekend.
We are running 2.4.20 on some of these boxes and it is stable.  We're
only having problems with the 2.6 kernel.
These systems did stay running for a few hours and then started dying
every
few minutes and then stable again for a few hours.  They are in a air
conditioned machine room with UPS power supplies and we have 11
identical
2500 systems.  Only the ones running 2.6 have issues and those issues
start
the moment 2.6 is installed so we're convinced its software.
What's puzzling me is that the aacraid driver isn't so different between
2.4.20 and 2.6.  Is there a debugging run or something that I can get
that
would help diagnose the problem?
