Hi,
A few questions/suggestions:
- is it still vanilla -rc6-mm1; I've seen on kernel list you tried
some fixes around raid?
- could you remind this lockdep warning; is it always and the same,
always before crash, or no rules?
- I've seen you looked after double freeing, but this last debug list
warning could suggest locking problems during list modification too.
- above git-nfsd and git-net tests should be probably repeated with
-rc6-mm1 git versions: so vanilla rc6 plus both these -mm patches
only, and if bug triggers, with one reversed; btw., since in previous
message you mentioned that 50 packages could be not enough to trigger
this, these 54 above could make too little margin yet.
