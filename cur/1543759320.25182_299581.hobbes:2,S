OK, I'll try to find some better documentation about input devices, any
tips/pointers would be nice. I'm completly new to kernel drivers, I'm used to
writing drivers in embedded systems.
The driver is made in the way it is today because there is also a driver for
X which read raw events from /dev/input/eventX. It's called lictouch, I have
the source for it too, but I'm not (yet) part of any developing there.
It would be a really nice feature if one could use the touchscreen as a
legacy interface, but then I would need to be able to calibrate the screen in
the driver and not frontend. At least preferable.

I really don't have an answer, I'm still waiting for the datascheet to the
controller beeing used. When I get that I can perhaps do calibration in the
driver, and not with a config file or in xf86free/x.org config.
