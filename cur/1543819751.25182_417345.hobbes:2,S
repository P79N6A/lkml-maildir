Well first off, as addressed elsewhere, a confined task cannot mount.
Also, if you do bind mount as above, we will find both but we only report
the first.  The path reported in this event will be used to generate policy.
Clearly if the ordering of which entry is found first varies, then for a
subsequent iteration, the policy may not be sufficient to grant the task 
access and it will likely fail. This is important, a failure to specify a 
path in a profile results in a failure of access not a allowal of access. 
Solution, include all paths in the profile confining the task.
I do grant that a situation of very temporal mounts can make the generation 
of a sane profile difficult. I've not used namespaces in such a manner so
I've not seen exactly how bad it is.  One of my hopes from this thread was
that people would post real life in the trenches with namespaces examples,
both to aid us and maybe to illustrate where our approach is broken. Likewise 
if you generate policy in an environment with a large number of mounts which 
will not esist when the task runs under policy enforcement, you could run into 
issues.

I believe there is a misunderstanding about the value of a unhashed dentry 
when a file is unlinked from under a task. I responded to a more detailed 
version of the same question posted by Valdis Kletniek. 
Thanks for the post.
