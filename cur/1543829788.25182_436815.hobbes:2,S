Let me add some notes:
Some drives do not support (or correctly support) the 'read buffer' command.
As I don't have all drives, I cannot tell how the drive from the OP behaves on
Solaris. All drives I've seen so far return an error on Solaris - not a timeout,
so it is not clear, whether the hang on Linux would result in a timeout on Solaris.
It may be that the /dev/hd* interface ignores timeouts, but it may also be that
the bus situation did cause a kernel hang. As my experience shows that all 
drives behave always the same, it should be simple to trace the problem for the 
owner of a drive.
