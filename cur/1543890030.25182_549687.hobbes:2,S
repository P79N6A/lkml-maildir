Sorry Kyle, I don't think it's a trivial one.  The opposite.

Please read my message again. I didn't say, "This can never be achieved".
I said, "This can not be easily achieved".

Yes,! You got the point.
Both label-based and pathname-based apporaches have the advantaes and
difficluties.
In that sense they are equal. That's what I wanted to say.
Both approaches can be improved and even can be used combined to
overcome the difficulties. Let's not fight against and think together,
then we can make Linux better.

I'm very interested in how you can know that you have the
correct object labeling (this is my point). Could you tell?
I assume your best efforts end up with
- have a proper fc definitions and guard them (this can be done)
- executes relabeling as needed (best efforts)
- hope everything work fine

I don't deny DAC at all.  If we deny DAC, we can't live with Linux
it's the base.  MAC can be used to cover the shortages of DAC and
Linux's simple user model, that's it.
From security point of view, simplicity is always the virtue and the way to go.
Inode combined label is guaranteed to be a single at any point time.
This is the most noticeable advantage of label-based security.
But writing policy with labels are somewhat indirect way (I mean, we need
"ls -Z" or "ps -Z").  Indirect way can cause flaw so we need a lot of work
that is  what I wanted to tell.
