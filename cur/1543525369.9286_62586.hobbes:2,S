... which may be several hours of IO.  That's effectively unbounded as
far as the user is concerned, and still implies that we need extra
fairness policies above that provided by a plain CSCAN IO scheduler.

No, unfortunately it is a common pattern --- if a user process starts
writing to a large file sequentially, then the blocks hitting the IO
layers typically end up being queued in ascending order of block number,
which is exactly what is required to provoke maximal unfairness in an
unmodified CSCAN.
