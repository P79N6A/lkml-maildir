Hi,
I have recently installed a 368 With RH 5.2 for some home routing use......
This is working fine, but now I want to recompile the kernel...
Problem is, the machine has not enough disk space for the sources etc. So I
decided to build it on an other machine, which was no problem. Putting the
kernel on the other machine was ok too..... But now for the problem: How do
I get modules from the one machine too het other, and how do I install the
om the other machine???
Thanx,
Dirk
