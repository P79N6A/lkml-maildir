Ok, this will give rfkill more possibilities as I could in that case
also allow the user to toggle the radio to the state that is different
than indicated by the key.
Currently this was not possible since I had to keep in mind that there
were keys that would directly control the radio.

Well there are 3 possible hardware key approaches:
 1 - Hardware key that controls the hardware radio, and does not report anything to userspace
 2 - Hardware key that does not control the hardware radio and does not report anything to userspace
 3 - Hardware key that does not control the hardware radio and reports the key to userspace
So rfkill should not be used in the case of (1) and (3), but we still need something to support (2)
or should the keys not be handled by userspace and always by the driver?
This is making rfkill moving slowly away from the generic approach for all rfkill keys as the initial
intention was.

Ok, so input device opening should not block the rfkill signal and the rfkill handler
should still go through with its work unless a different config option indicates that
userspace wants to handle the event.
