The first step is to figure out as exactly as possible _when_ it started 
happening.

So is 2.6.19 good? 2.6.20-rc1? -rc2?
If you're a git user (or even just marginally interested in learning), the 
best thing to do is to find some good kernel (the more recent, the better, 
but the keyword is *some* kernel that works well), and a bad kernel (the 
older the better, just to avoid unnecessary work, but again, you can just 
take the most recent too), and then just use "git bisect".
If you bisect it down to one particular commit, that will help us a lot, 
but even if you only bisect it down by booting a handful of kernels (say, 
5-6), it will already have cut things down a lot, and probably more easily 
and efficiently than if you just downloaded daily snapshots and tried to 
narrow it down that way.
