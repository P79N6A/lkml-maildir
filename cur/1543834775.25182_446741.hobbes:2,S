I don't know enough about SCSI to say if this driver core patch will
help them out or not.  At first glance it does, but the device order
gets all messed up from what users are traditionally used to, so perhaps
the scsi core will just have to stick with their own changes.

That's fine, nothing in this patch precludes you from doing that at all.
I'm not thinking that all busses will enable this, rather that some
will, and some will rely on their bus code to do threaded stuff if it
can.
