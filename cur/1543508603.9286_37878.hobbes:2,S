It seems really unlikely to me that CPU load could result in swapped
or duplicated characters. But I think there is definitely some kind of
problem in the serial driver for 2.2.11+ (at least) kernels. On my
Toshiba 4020CDT, running 2.0.36, I can talk to my Palm IIIx and my
digital camera. When I boot 2.2.11 or 2.2.12, I can't (reliably). It
will work for a little while and then misbehave (pilot-manager says
"Weird packet" and gets errors backing up the rest of the databases,
kdcpi just stops printing further progress downloading images).
I am running Debian 2.1 (slink) with a bit of potato (including glibc
2.1). I had no problems with these programs on this machine before
switching to a 2.2 kernel.
Running slink under VMWare, or in a chrooted environment (i.e.,
without the newer potato libraries but with the newer kernel) also
exhibits the problem (with pilot-manager; they may be two different
problems, of course).
I posted about this to debian-user, and got one response from somebody
who claimed he was using pilot-manager with 2.2.12 with no problems.
If I can reproduce this problem on another machine besides the one I
do all my actual work on, I will try to determine what the most recent
kernel that doesn't cause this behavior is and report my findings.
