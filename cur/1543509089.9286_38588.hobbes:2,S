Subject: [2.2.5-RH6] knfsd: ext2 filesystem corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I have a system running the standard RedHat 6.0 2.2.5 kernel which is
acting as an NFS server, among other things. I am using the standard NFS
server which came with RH6. This machine holds the root filesystem for
various linux boxes acting as X-terminals, which load the kernel locally
and use NFS to mount their root filesystem. In this case the X-terminals
are running kernel 2.2.1 and booting into what is essentially RedHat 6.0,
but with heavily modified startup scripts.
The X-terminals' root filesystems are located in /tftpboot, e.g.
/tftpboot/ibm1, /tftpboot/ibm2. Occationally I want to update these
directories, so I delete everything in the directory and make a fresh copy
(cp -a /tftpboot/skel /tftpboot/ibm1). If this occurs while the
corresponding terminal is on, then the next time that it requires access to
the filesystem, I start getting a whole lot of error messages being
produced by the server about errors on the ext2 filesystem that hosts
/tftpboot, a sample of which is attached to the end of this message. This
is quite reproducable and occurs every time the above steps are carried out.
If I then reboot the server, it does a fsck over the filesystem and then
loads normally. Most of the time there hasn't been any corruption, but I
have had small errors in other parts of the filesystem, which I assume is
as a result of this. This behaviour also seems to be able to continue over
a reboot of the server. I once tried rebooting the server while leaving the
X-terminal as it was, the server then started to produce the same sort of
errors as soon as the NFS server was restarted.
I know this is a relatively old kernel and RedHat apply many patches to it
as well, but it seems like a fairly serious problem. 
Cheers,
Martin.
