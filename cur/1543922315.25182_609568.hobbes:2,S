It's definitely a BIOS bug and I doubt that disabling the bit works on
every BIOS. I have a system here on my desk, where neither of the CPUs
has the bit set, but the lapic timer stops wreckage is there once both
CPUs go into idle. 
The mindless creativity of BIOS writers seems to exceed the ability of
hardware designers to produce strange chips by orders of magnitude.
