There are two distinct issues.
-- libata locks up in partition table read on an hpt366+old maxtor disk
   that has ben working fine for many years with old ide driver. (It
   still works fine when I boot to the alternate ide-based kernel).
-- ide driver locks up on hpt366+new maxtor disk under heavy 
   i/o load. I was able to copy 60GB from old to new disk without a
   problem; however, raid reconstruction locks it up, maybe after 5-15
   seconds.
   This probably is "hardware related"; its something that the new 
   hard drive does. Given that its being sold at a big discount, it
   may even be that the sellers know that this is a crappy disk. :-)
   All I want is some way of resetting the disk, and continuing on.
I'm stalled in debugging; I'm not sue what I'm looking for.
