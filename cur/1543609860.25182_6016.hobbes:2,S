Sadly, while you _might_ be able to change the BLOCK_SIZE to be something
other than 1kB, there are probably so many places that assume a 1kB size
that you will need a lot of fixing.  I'm not saying that fixing these
things is bad (it would actually be good for many reasons), but just a
heads-up that changing the BLOCK_SIZE define _probably_ won't get you 8TB
devices (maybe a broken system, or corrupt fs instead).  Use caution.
Cheers, Andreas
