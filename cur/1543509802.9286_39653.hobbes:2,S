Hi
I just got a copy of O'Reilly's Linux Device Drivers and I've hit the
little problem that the examples it comes with are written for a 2.0.x
kernel and won't compile on 2.2.x.
Does anyone know if there are updated versions of these examples
available, or even an update to the main text detailing the
differences?
I had a quick look in /usr/src/linux/Documentation, but there didn't
seem to be much coverage of the specific internals that have changed
for drivers.
Cheers,
