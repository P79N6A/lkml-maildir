Sorry. Build error for a non-debug configuration:
drivers/char/drm/drm_stub.c: In function `drm_fill_in_dev':
drivers/char/drm/drm_stub.c:60: error: parse error before '{' token
make[3]: *** [drivers/char/drm/drm_stub.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/char/drm] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/char] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
If CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT and/or CONFIG_RT_DEADLOCK_DETECT are set, the
RT-V0.7.18 build succeeds.
Not big deal. However, my personal benchmarks (jackd-R + 8*fluidsynth) are
being based on production-like kernel configurations (no kernel debug
options set), so I guess it will have to wait :)
Cheers.
