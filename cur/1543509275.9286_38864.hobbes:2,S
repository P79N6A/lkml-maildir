ok, the second attempt to answer my own question (the first one was
slightly inaccurate). The stuff prepared by module_init() in non-module
case is placing the pointer to the function in the __initcall list which
is processed at a very well-defined place in init/main.c:do_initcalls():
        initcall_t *call;
        call = &__initcall_start;
        do {
                (*call)();
                call++;
        } while (call < &__initcall_end);
Hopefully, now things are clear to everyone (including myself).
Regards,
Tigran
