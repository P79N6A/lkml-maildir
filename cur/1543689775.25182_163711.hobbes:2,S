Well that depends. The classic audio CD access is through hardware. The
drive spins down to 1x speed and dumps the data over its private line to
the soundcard's CDDA input channel. So in this case you're right.
The other way to do it is ripping the data through the drive's data bus,
like DAC tools do, and play the music on the fly. This way
'multi-processing' is possible.
So what you have to do is to find an audio player that plays CDDA with
the second method.
