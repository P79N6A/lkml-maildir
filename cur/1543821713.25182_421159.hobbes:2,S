Agreed - I have had experience of a system (Intel 855GME chipset based, 
AMI BIOS) which emulates the i8042 in the BIOS at SMI time.  Mmm nice. 
When the Linux i8042 driver can polled the (pretend) i8042, the system 
spent ages in the BIOS, and general interrupt latency on the system fell 
apart...  Oh what a mess.
A limited solution is probably to modify the existing EDAC drivers so 
that they ensure SMI generation is disabled (for the specific errors 
that the EDAC drivers are designed to handle).  The OS is then at least 
doing the right thing, even if the BIOS isn't...  This should improve 
upon the current behaviour on some systems, and shouldn't (as far as I 
can see) break any others.  The EDAC code also probably needs to be 
toughened up (at least on some chipsets) so that it doesn't fall over 
when the BIOS steps on its toes.
Tim.
