Thanks for those patches and sorry for the lack of response, I was out
of town for the last week.
I have quite a few changes in my tree already for the sonypi driver,
and I was delaying the submission because I need to solve a problem
with the integration with the input subsystem...
Some of your changes (those related to module_param(), wait_event()
use etc) were already in my tree, those related to whitespace cleanup,
platform instead of sysdev etc are new and I will integrate them.
Let me work a bit on those, and I will try to separate my changes
and resubmit them in the next days.
Stelian.
