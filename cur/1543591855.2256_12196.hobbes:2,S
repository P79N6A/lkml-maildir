Me either.  But Tom Vier, the guy who started this thread
was able to use up the 8MB.  Which is completely believable.
The following should aleviate the situation on these smaller
machines where the direct map does cover all physical memory.
Really, we were failing gratuitously before.
On Tsunami and Titan, espectially with more than 4G ram we
should probably just go ahead and allocate the 512M or 1G
scatter-gather arena.
(BTW, Andrea, it's easy enough to work around the Cypress
problem by marking the last 1M of the 1G arena in use.)
