Yes.

Yes.  Here's the relevant part of the call tree:
setup_arch
  acpi_numa_init
    acpi_numa_arch_fixup
      acpi_online_node_fixup (test available_cpus)
  ... 
  acpi_boot_init
    acpi_table_parse_madt(..., acpi_parse_lsapic, ...)
      acpi_parse_lsapic (increment available_cpus)
Note that we test available_cpus in acpi_online_node_fixup()
before we increment it in acpi_parse_lsapic(), so the inner
loop is never executed.
