They seem to stay at the previous value in the current CPUs, but it's 
undefined behaviour yes.

Can you cope with that in valgrind? If I change it there will
be kernels with both behaviour around for a long time.

That would probably add some complications to the syscall exit path:
there is some code sharing between 32bit and 64bit, in particular 64bit
execve uses the IRET path to restore all registers and there can be a 
signal after that.
The only case that wouldn't be handled by checking the segment would
be that if someone defines a 64bit LDT code segment and uses it, it
will not work. But that won't work anyways from 64bit because SYSRET
always forces __USER_CS. If you want to do any 64bit system calls
you cannot use such custom segment anyways. 
So i don't see any drawbacks in just checking the segment for this.
