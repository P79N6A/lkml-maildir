My cryptfs is a stackable file system which mounts over any existing
directory.  No keys are stored on disk, and the underlying file system
(ext2, nfs, whatever you want) does NOT change at all.  Therefore, you use
normal fsck and other utilities, w/o fear of corruption.  You do your backup
on the lower-level (ciphertext) directories, which is (1) faster b/c you
don't need to decrypt and (2) safer b/c the backup operator doesn't need to
decrypt the data.
The cost of this stacking is 5-7% over the lower-level (stacked-on) file
system.  This cost is well worth it IMHO, esp. given that crypto algorithms
cost much more than that.
You can get software and several papers on the subject from
