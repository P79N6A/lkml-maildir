Minimal approach: Register motherboard EISA ID (i.e. slot zero) ports in
/proc/ioports.  Works on all kernel versions.  See $0.02 patch below.
This is probably the least intrusive way to get what you want.  It doesn't
add Yet Another Proc File, and costs zero bloat to the 99.9% of us who 
have a better chance of meeting Aunt Tillie than an EISA box. 
Possible alternative: Create something like /proc/bus/eisa/devices which
lists the EISA ID (e.g. abc0123) found in each EISA slot.   This might
have been worthwhile some 8 years ago, but now? ....
Paul.
