Simply to try and find bugs. If we have a math emulator and it's
selectable for my CPU type, then it should damn well work ;-)

Hmm, I guess that could be the problem. The emulator should disable
any stuff which it's not able to handle. I've not actually looked very
much at the emulator code yet, so I didn't realize it didn't disable
what it couldn't handle, but getting it to do that sounds like a
sensible first step.

That was my thought as well, which is exactely why I chose to try it -
thinking that it might expose some bugs in math-emu or elsewhere.
