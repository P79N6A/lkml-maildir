Roman,
I don't get this, you are arguing that we should put it in because it
doesn't do any damage. First of all it does, by adding a lot of clutter
all over the place. Second, if we take that argument, then we should
allow anybody to put in anything they want, are you also suggesting we
put devfs back in?
Point is that the Linux kernel gets so many proposals, some are good
some are bad and some while maybe looking like a good idea at the
beginning, show out later to be a bad idea - LTT falls into this
category. *However*, it doesn't mean the knowledge and tools that were
developed with LTT are bad or useless.
To take another related project, look at relayfs. There was so much
noise about it when it was initially pushed, yuck I even remember how it
was suggested that printk should be implemented via relayfs. But look at
it now, there is no fs/relayfs/* these days. The kernel moved on, used
the knowledge optained and provided the feature in a better way -
exactly like it is being proposed to do for trace points, by using
dynamic probes.
