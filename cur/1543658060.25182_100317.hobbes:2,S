Warning: stdin:8: comparison is always false due to limited range of data.
Even if I overlook that you're effectively comparing the incomparable,
Microsoft making 370 times more than RedHat says _nothing_ about their
actual achievement in terms of software development.  Should you insist
on that correlation, though, I'd recommend you cancel your Wired magazine
subscription as soon as possible, because continuing to read their stuff
might put your health at stake. <g>
