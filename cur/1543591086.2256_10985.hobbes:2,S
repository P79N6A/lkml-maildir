Solaris has a scheme that addresses the issue at well. Device nodes 
live in /devices (/dev has soft links into /devices) and have 
system-global-geographic names. In Solaris talk, the 0-1-2 of 
eth0-1-2 i an instance. There's a file /etc/pathtoinst that records 
the connection of an device instance to its /devices geographical 
name.
It does keep naming stable, but can be a PITA at times when you're 
reconfiguring a system and *want* to renumber things. (There are 
magic ways to do it, though).
That's all Solaris 2.6; not sure about 2.8.
