That's possible.

It's not really the same, the private part of the inode is really private
to the specific fs. thread_info is arch specific, but it fields have to be
accessed by generic code. At compile time there is also always only one
thread_info contrary to vfs inodes.
Anyway, it's not really important which structure includes which, it just
has to be decided for all archs uniformly to get include dependencies
right.
