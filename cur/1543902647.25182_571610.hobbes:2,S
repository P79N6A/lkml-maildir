ah, i didnt notice that automount mixed up timespec with timeval! That 
is nasty and the tv_nsec field (which really is ts_usec to 
pthread_cond_timewait()) must stay cleared - or rather, to avoid bugs of 
this type, a timespec variable should be used for all this.

yeah, i'll generalize it, but our internal getnstimeofday() used on most 
architectures is using __get_realtime_clock_ns(), and the patch you 
attached already adds the second-overflow logic to it.
there are two versions of getnstimeofday(), a TIME_INTERPOLATION one and 
a !TIME_INTERPOLATION one. TIME_INTERPOLATION is only used on ia64 at 
the moment - and that one indeed does not have the second overflow 
logic.

ok, i'll do something clean.
