the complexity in munlock to rebuild what you destroyed in mlock, that's
linear at best (and for anonymous mappings there's no objrmap, plus
objrmap isn't even linear but quadratic in its scan [hence the problem
with it], though in practice it would be normally faster than the linear
of the page scanning ;)
