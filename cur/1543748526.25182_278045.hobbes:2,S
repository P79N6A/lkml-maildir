Valdis,
Thank you for the reply.  There is no need for real-time tracking to
meet this requirement.  You have the right idea with the timestamped
message.
And yes, the audit subsystem that's in existence now is something we
want to work with and improve.  Like I had mentioned earlier, it could
just be a matter of logging the VFS relevant portion ("this
<file/directory> was accessed / altered by") with the same serial
number as the syscall ("open() called under these <conditions>") and
then piecing the entire audit record together in userspace and filter
it accordingly.
The main goal here is to not be redundant and make use of our
resources.  I personally like Robert's idea with the general hooking
framework.  Making the audit subsystem, itself, modular also sounds
like a pretty good idea.
Thanks again!
