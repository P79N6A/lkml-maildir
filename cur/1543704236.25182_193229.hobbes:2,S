Well if thats the case, then I wonder why the random word spams
stopped getting through my filters after I spent the appropriate time
training my Bayesian filters. I must have done something that made the
spammers laugh so hard they didn't bother spamming me anymore.

Well now we're getting to the laughable part: by expecting people to
'click on a link you obviously assume that everybody uses a GUI mail
client. Guess what, I don't have the patience for that. So guess what,
having to launch a web browser and copy-pasting a random link into it
in order to send you email makes me uninterested in mailing you in the
first place.

Maybe you should consider using it properly, guess what it does work.

600 spams in my spambox over the last 48 hours, _1_ in my inbox, guess
that speaks for itself.
'nuff said, back to spending time on real issues, such as fixing
kernel bugs.
