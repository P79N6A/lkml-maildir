Subject: [PATCH][RFC] SVM: Add Support for Nested Paging in AMD Fam16 CPUs

Hi,                                                                                                                              
here is the first release of patches for KVM to support the Nested Paging (NPT)
feature of AMD QuadCore CPUs for comments and public testing. This feature
improves the guest performance significantly. I measured an improvement of
around 17% using kernbench in my first tests.
This patch series is basically tested with Linux guests (32 bit legacy
paging, 32 bit PAE paging and 64 bit Long Mode). Also tested with Windows Vista
32 bit and 64 bit. All these guests ran successfully with these patches. The
patch series only enables NPT for 64 bit Linux hosts at the moment.
Please give these patches a good and deep testing. I hope we have this patchset
ready for merging soon.
Joerg
