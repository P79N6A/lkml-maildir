Hello,
I have a few bits of information for the PCI gurus:
In a HP Vectra VLI8.CEL there is a PCI device from Cirrus Logic with 
id=6003 that is unknown. The type of the device is a "multimedia 
audio controller".
I also have a rare piece of hardware here, namely a Brooktrout TR114+ 
P2B (2 channel active ISDN FAX card) that is completely unknown:
/proc/pci even reports an unknown class (but doesn't give the number).
The unknown Vendor id is 12e4, and the unknown device id is 1140...
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
P.S. Sorry, I had no "lspci" available for more info, and the 
/proc/bus/pci had non-obvious format (for me).
