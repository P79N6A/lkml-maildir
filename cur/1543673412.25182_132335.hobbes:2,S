There are lots of other IDE bugs that wont go away until the taskfile
stuff is included, the locking bugs that allow any user to hang the IDE
layer in 2.5, and some other updates are forward ported. Bart is making
amazing progress.

True of char, scsi and others. I'd like to propose that we don't treat
drivers that need porting as a 2.6test showstopper. In fact its going to
be a lot easier to fix them once someone can port them knowing the core
code is frozen. 
drivers/pci
Some cardbus crashes the system
Hotplug locking is hosed
drivers/pcmcia
Most drivers crash the system on eject randomly with timer bugs. I think
after RML's stuff is in most of the pcmcia/cardbus ones go except the
locking disaster

Lots of recent 2.4 NFS fixes in the client especially want forward
porting

Create a 32bit uid, turn accounting on. Shock horror it doesnt work
because the field is 16bit. We need an acct structure flag day for 2.6
IMHO

In 2.5.6x-ac - just worked.

FIXED

VIA APIC stuff is one bit of this, there are also some other reports
that were caused by ACPI not setting level v edge trigger some times

"FIXED" - We've established the device mapper can do the translation.
Its a chunk of work for vendors but its doable

Seems to be working for me now as of 2.5.69-ac1

Linus has been updating DRI stuff since then so may be sorted

The wonder Bart is currently redoing ide setup which is the big mess
left and has tackled taskfile block I/O already.

Fixed for 2.4.x now - can be ported easily. This has folded into
"forward port IDE driver fixes from 2.4"

Some old draft patches from Torben exist for the beginnings of
this.

Problem understood now, feasible fix in 2.4/2.4-ac. (440GX has two IRQ
routers, we use the $PIR table with the PIIX, but the 440GX doesnt use
the PIIX for its IRQ routing). Fall back to BIOS for 440GX works and
Intel concurs.
> - 2.5.x doesn't handle VIA APIC right yet - dont know why
1. We must write the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE, 2. We have quirk handlers that
seem to trash it.
> - ACPI needs the relax patches merging to work on lots of laptops
Working in 2.4.21-ac, Toshiba cheap laptops now run a treat. Forward
port looks like a patch command
Other items:
PC9800 is not fully merged - most of this I think is 2.7 stuff but a few
bits might be 2.6 candidate
SH3/SH3-64 need resynching, as do some other ports. No impact on
mainstream platforms hopefully
