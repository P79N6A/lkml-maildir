If it prevents a blkdev cleanup, I'd say we disable it at least and if it
should be really needed, we can still fix it later. Is anyone actually
using "devfs=only"? What's the use of it anyway? It only disables the
ability to address a driver by dev_t, I didn't know we want to go that
far.
bye, Roman
