any facts and details ?  just a "it's not our fault" is not much evidence (on any side).
please keep in mind when SO 5.0 was released!  at least at that time
glibc 2.0 and pre-2.1 have been so full of compatibility problems
that I believe the SO (Netscape, Applix, Orcale, ...) boys 
that there was no chance not using glibc 2.0.7.
anyway, what has to be taken care of to use glibc 2.0 to build 2.1-proof 
applications ?  are there any docs, FAQs, hints, ... ?
