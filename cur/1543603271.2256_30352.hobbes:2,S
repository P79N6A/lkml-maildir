Well, I was not able to trigger reboot with unpatched kernel. With
patched one behavior looks same to me, except that elf_map went wrong
is printed by kernel.
I was not able to find where problem could be with unpatched
kernel, but arguments passed to do_brk(), set into mm->start_brk, 
{start,end}_code and so on looks very suspicious... But as on my 
system it does not crash neither with nor without patch below, I 
leave answer on someone else.
Btw, my system is 2.4.10-ac2, SMP PIII, compiled with Debian 2.95.4.
