Are you serious or just joking? :) 
Sure it might make it harder to read, but allowing selectable policies
is very interesting. Peter's patches go half-way into that direction.
Lets say, if CLOCK-Pro underperforms for a given workload (take into
account that its simply optimizing reclaim for a subset of all existing
access patterns, ie. heuristics), it would be easier for people to
develop/use different policies.

I meant something more like Documentation/vm/clockpro.txt, for easier
reading of patch reviewers and community in general.

I see - that is a fundamental change from the original CLOCK-Pro
algorithm, right? 
Do you have a clear idea about the consequences of not having           
non-resident pages in the clock?
