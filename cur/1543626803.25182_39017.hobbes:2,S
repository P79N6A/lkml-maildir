Conceivably, something somewhere is forgetting to reenable interrupts,
and we're just not noticing because the scheduler and/or return
from syscall just turns them on unconditionally.
There are a couple of things you can try.
First is to just use the kernel profiler.  Do it on uniprocessor
to make life simpler.   If you see a particular function
is showing up prominently then perhaps that's the place
where interrupts are getting turned back on, and that may
point us at the source of the problem.
Note that you'll probably get better retults with a higher
profiling frequency - build the UP kernel with local APIC
support and use `readprofile -M10' to profile at 1000 Hz.
The other approach would be to apply
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/timepeg-2.4.19-pre6-1.patch.gz
and enable "Timepeg instrumentation" and "Interrupt latency
instrumentation" in the Kernel Hacking menu.
Compile up 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/tpt.tar.gz
and run
	sudo ./tpt -s | sort -nr +5 | head -20
then run your workload, then run the above command a second time.
I get:
        slab.c:1323 -> slab.c:1347  572      .66  55.91     5.90   3375.52
       do_IRQ.in:0 -> softirq.c:84  1628   10.72  22.18    11.22  18270.64
          exit.c:396 -> exit.c:430  3       5.50  10.66     7.66     22.98
ll_rw_blk.c:886 -> ll_rw_blk.c:996  54      1.25   8.72     2.15    116.28
which shows that the worst-case interrupt-off times
were between lines 1347 and 1323 of slab.c.
Beware that the timepeg patch increases your kernel
size tremendously - it's probably OK with a uniprocessor
build, but even though I've dropped NR_CPUS to 2, a
large SMP kernel build can simply fail to load.
