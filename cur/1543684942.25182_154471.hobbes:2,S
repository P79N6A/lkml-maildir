Yes thats what I think. Reading an mp3 shouldn't take a lot of
disk power, and seeing as its sustaining 20MB/s of writes, and
the default AS biases reads quite heavily over writes then it
would be very surprising.
Of course some minimum read _latency_ would be required: this
could actually be done easily with strace come to think of it.
Maybe some xmms mapped memory is being swapped out? But that
would be more of a VM problem.
Get the test run when the mp3 is in ram: if it can't be
reproduced then it would be worth looking into further. I guess
the process scheduler though.
