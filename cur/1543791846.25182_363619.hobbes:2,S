Huh?
In Ram's specific case, I think, the call path is sys_setsockopt() ->
sock_setsockopt() -> sock_set_timeout, which has a definition of:
static int sock_set_timeout(long *timeo_p, char __user *optval, int optlen)
where optval is the same optval in sys_setsockopt():
sys_setsockopt(int fd, int level, int optname, char __user *optval, int optlen)
and is a pointer to a userspace timeval structure, in this case.
timeval's have two members, both of which are signed, so it makes
perfect sense for one of them to be (potentially) negative:
struct timeval {
        time_t          tv_sec;         /* seconds */
        suseconds_t     tv_usec;        /* microseconds */
};
(time_t --> __kernel_time_t --> long on all archs; suseconds_t -->
__kernel_suseconds_t --> int or long on all archs)
Ram, what is the expected behavior of negative values in the timeval?
And what are you seeing happen right now?
As of 2.6.14, looks like we convert any non-zero values into jiffies
and store them in sk->sk_{rcv,snd}timeo...

This could be, and I think is what Ram was asking about -- I've asked
for some clarification.
Thanks,
