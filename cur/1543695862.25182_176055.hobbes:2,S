It's different because you need to reserve a fixed amount of ram for the
ramdisk while I was only using the caching features of the kernel as a
fast read-ahead mechanism. But I agree with you that the result should be
the same.

OK, so it's not a disk IO problem at all. It's really related to the sound
driver it seems. Now that you say it, I remember having noticed skips on
my laptop with a via 82cxxx chip after tens of minutes playing. At first
I thought it was related to other activity on the system, but it did exactly
what you describe, play seconds 1, 2, then 5 without a hole between them.
There may be a problem with the way the audio buffer gets allocated or freed.

Yes, there is. I have a quick'n'dirty program which does exactly that.
Basically, you tell it how many kB you want to free, then it allocates
and uses that amount of memory, frees it and exits. Buffered data gets
flushed very quickly. I sometimes give it a try before starting to work
on large kernel trees, because it helps the entire directories to fit in
cache.
Here it is if you're interested. Don't start it without an argument, it
will try to allocate 4G !

Willy
