note that profiling a section that takes this short with rdtsc is...
not really working well in practice; you're profiling something that's
smaller (or at least roughly the same size) than the cpu's out of order
speculation window, so your rdtsc greatly impacts what is actually
happening in the code.
as for the change... 16->35 cycles can well be a code or data alignment
change or even a branch misprediction due to some minor code generation
issue.... you're looking at a small microscopic part of the universe
after all, the butterfly in the pacific WILL influence you ;-)
