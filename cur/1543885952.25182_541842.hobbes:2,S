Well it seems that SLOB was not well maintained. RCU has been around for a 
long time and SLOB has not been updated to cope with it.

SLUB can put 32 objects sized 128 byte each in a 4k page. Can SLOB do 
the same?

adjust the cacheline alignment and switch off SLUB debugging. 
define L1_CACHE_BYTES to be 4 or so.
