As the OP, good to know that all those who said "it's just a
coincidence that your machine that has been rock stable for 6 years
just happened to crash at midnight GMT when the leap second was
inserted..." were wrong :)
Thanks for the good follow-up and detective work.
Hopefully, it's not too late for Fedora to provide the patch before
support for Fedora 8 expires on the 7th...
