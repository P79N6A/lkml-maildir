Distros don't want to build and ship an additional kernel just for dumping
purposes. They want to use production kernel as binary itself as dump
capture kernel. It reduces overheads for them significantly.
Currently we are reserving 64MB of memory for our testing purposes on 
i386 and x86_64. Any thing lesser than that, sometimes either system
hangs or OOM killer pitches in. Now people are working on preparing custom
initrd for dumping purposes so that dumping can be done from early user
space itself. This might lead to reduced memory usage and more reliability.
I think soon it should be available in fedora (busybox based custom initrd
for crashdumping purposes.)
