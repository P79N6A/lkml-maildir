Hi Linuxers,
some time ago, I remind to have heard rumours, that future versions of the
Linux generic block device driver  will support block devices with
more/less
than 512 bytes per block/hardsector. In the 2.2.10 Kernel I still see the
">>9" operands, which indicate to me, that this one does not support larger
blocks.
For a rather untypical disk device attached to a processor, not currently
supported by the official Linux source, this feature would be very helpful.
Is there some progress in this work, or has it been dropped, because
nearly all modern hardware is based on 512 byte SCSI/IDE disks?
Does anybody know anyone, who has been working on it?
Grüße / Regards
Holger Smolinski
