Let's look at it this way - unless you find a way to save sizeof(struct dentry)
+ sizeof(struct inode) in every kobject/attr etc., there is no
way you can beat ageing of dentries/inodes.

That is not a very realistic argument, ia32 customers will likely
run systems with large number of disks and will have lowmem problem.
Besides that think about the added complexity of lookups due to
all those pinned dentries forever residing in dentry hash table.

I don't see how you can claim that the total overhead of the entire
system is high. See Christian's numbers. The point here is pretty
straightforward -
sysfs currently uses dentries to represent filesystem hierarchy.
We want to create the dentries on the fly and age them out.
So, we can no longer use dentries to represent filesystem hierarchy.
Now, *something* has to represent the actual filesystem
hierarchy, so that dentries/inodes can be created on a lookup
miss based on that. So, what do you do here ? kobject and
its associates already represent most of the information necessary
for a backing store. Maneesh just added a little more to complete
what is equivalent of a on-disk filesystem. This allows vfs to
create dentries and inodes on the fly and age later on. Granted
that there are probably ugliness in the design to be sorted out
and it may have taken kobjects in a slightly different direction
than earlier, but it is not that odd when you look at it
from the VFS point of view.

As I said before, no matter how much you save on kobjects and attrs,
I can't see how you can account for ageing of dentries and inodes.
Please look at it from the VFS angle and see if there is a better
way to represent kobjects/attrs in order to create dentries/inodes
on demand and age later.
