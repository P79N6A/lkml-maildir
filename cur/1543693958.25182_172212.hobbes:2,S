A stab in the dark (I don't have a KVM handy, or even a mouse at the
moment to test on) but you could try editing the psmouse_extensions()
function in drivers/input/mouse/psmouse-base.c :
	if (psmouse_noext)
		return PSMOUSE_PS2;
replace PSMOUSE_PS2 with another one of the defined variables found near
the bottom of: drivers/input/mouse/psmouse.h
You should be able to figure out which name most closely matches you
mouse by looking at the psmouse_extensions() function.
