Should not be a problem for ksymoops.  Most entries use this regex,
where [ ] is optional.
#define BRACKETED_ADDRESS       "\\[*<([0-9a-fA-F]{4,})>\\]* *"
Printing multiple addresses (with our without [ ]) plus their symbols
on the same line will stop ksymoops processing at the first symbol
name, but who cares?  If you can print a symbol then you already have
kallsyms and you do not need ksymoops.  If you do not have kallsyms
then the output is just multiple addresses on one line, which ksymoops
already handles.
