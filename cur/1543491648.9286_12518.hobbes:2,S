Which is
x = ( (y) ? x = 1 : x ) = 2

Really? See above. ?: has *higher* priority than =. Depending on whether
the result of = is considered as l- or r-value it is either correct and
equivalent to
x = ( (y) ? (x = 1) , x : x ) = 2
i.e.
if (y) x=1;
x = x = 2;
or invalid (for r-value variant).

It's about the same "workaround" as for "WTF 1+1*1+1 is not 4 ???"
