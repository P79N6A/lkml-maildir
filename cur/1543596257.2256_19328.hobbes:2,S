Subject: 2.4.6-pre9: Failed HPT370 detection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This kernel refuses to detect my HPT370 chipset. (where my root filesystem 
is, on raid0). It just hangs where the detection usually takes place, so no 
oops and no meaningfull bugreport :/
I have the same options set in my config as I always have, I've never had any 
problem with this before. 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366=y 
CONFIG_MD_RAID0=y
Anyone else seen this? Maybe its more VIA weirdness.
