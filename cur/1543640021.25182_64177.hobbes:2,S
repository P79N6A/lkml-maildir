I attempted to mount a msdos floppy (yes, I HAVE read the kt) and found this.
I did a little investigating of this (turned on -d on a ksymoops) and found
out the code ends up in a .text section!  Is this normal?
Anyway, I'm including a normal oops report, ksyms on that,  a extended ksyms
report, and lets see if anyone knows where to go from there.
Please excuse bzip2 and length.
If neither of the attachments get to the list, then I'll have to read the 
FAQ again, to see what I missed 8-( - I'm NOT flipping putting it inline 
unless I HAVE to!
<rant>
*sigh* - I don't BELIEVE I have to crawl back to 2.4-land just to send this 
through my LoseModem. Mind you, I ought to be grateful I have 56k at all.

I'll report fb corruption in another email.
