You'll need to do the same thing to fs/direct-io.c:DIO_BIO_MAX_SIZE
in that case.
I'd suggest that you just go in and change BIO_MAX_SECTORS
to 64.   Or 32 if you happen to be using a qlogic controller :(
So everything's broken in there - a hardwired constant doesn't
cut it.   Jens is cooking up an `add_page_to_bio()' API which
will do the right thing based upon q->max_sectors.  But that
is not yet available.
