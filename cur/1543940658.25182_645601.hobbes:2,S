Right ...

Not entirely.  The current interface has "dma_async_tx_descriptor"
wired pretty thoroughly into the call structure -- hard to avoid.
(And where's the "dma_async_rx_descriptor", since that's only TX??
Asymmetry like that is usually not a healthy sign.)  The engine is
not free to avoid those descriptors ...
And consider that many DMA transfers can often be started (after
cache synch operations) by writing less than half a dozen registers:
source address, destination address, params, length, enable.  Being
wildly generous, let's call that a couple dozen instructions, including
saving "what to do when it's done".  The current framework requires
several calls just to fill descriptors ... burning lots more than that
many instructions even before getting around to the Real Work!  (So I
was getting at low DMA overheads there, more than any particular way
to talk to the controller.)

Some depend on the buffer alignment and size, so "per-transfer" is the
norm.  Of course, if there aren't many channels, the various clients
may need to recycle them a lot ... which means lots of setup anyway.
That particular hardware has enough of the "logical" channels that each
driver gets its own; one level of arbitration involves assigning those
to underlying "physical" channels.

I wouldn't assume that systems have that much overcapacity on
their critical I/O paths.  I've certainly seen systems tune those
busses down in speed ... you might describe the "why" as "tweaking
battery performance", which wasn't at all an optional stage of the
system development process.

That's a fair place to start.  Although in my limited experience,
drivers won't stay there.  I have one particular headache in mind,
where the licensed IP has been glued to at least four different
DMA controllers.  None of them act similarly -- sanely? -- enough
to share much DMA interface code.  Initiation has little quirks;
termination has bigger ones; transfer aborts... sigh
Heck, you've seen similar stuff yourself with the MCI driver.
AVR32 and AT91 have different DMA models.  You chose to have
them use different drivers...

The OMAP1 DMA controller supports that.  There were also some
framebuffer-specific DMA options.  ;)

See above ... if you've got a driver that's got to cope with
different DMA engines, those may be inescapable.

That seems like one layer too many!

That would seem to be needed if the interface isn't going to become
a least-common-denominator approach -- or a kitchen-sink.
