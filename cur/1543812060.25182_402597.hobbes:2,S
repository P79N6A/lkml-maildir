Which is fine by NFS, at least. We don't care about performing
permissions checks in those cases anyway, so a NULL nameidata is OK. The
only cases where we currently need to take action in ->permission() are
 1) path walks (checking MAY_EXEC on the directory)
 2) open() (on NFSv2/v3 only)
 3) access()
In the future we can/should probably eliminate (2) by making an
atomic_open() for NFSv2/v3, so that we can correctly set the credential
that was used for the open() permissions check in the struct file.

An extra parameter should suffice for (1) and (2).
