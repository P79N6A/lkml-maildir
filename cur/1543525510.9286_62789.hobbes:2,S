Not for every but for most natural .config's :-) Yes, 2.2.14 is MUCH better
here. Since it's basically Cox's kernel :-) Usually situation is the following:
Linus's kernels can not be compiled in WAST range of configurations (like
"everything in modules, everything enabled") while Cox's kernels can do this
(ok, sometimes there are glitches to but usually compileability of Cox's kernels
are order of magnitude better then compileability of Linus's kernels).
It's more or less normal for development kernels but it's NOT Ok for stable
ones. I understood that Linus has LOTS OF things to worry about apart of
compileability of kernels with weird .config but then perhaps Cox should
release stable kernels from the very beginning ?
