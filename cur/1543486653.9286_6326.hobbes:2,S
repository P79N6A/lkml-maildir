Hello,
I don't know if this is of any interest for the kernel hackers, but maybe
someone can explain to me what it means, and if it's anything to worry about? 
I got this when "rm -rf'ing" a fairly large directory (the kernel source):
EXT2-fs error (device 03:06): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in
datazone - block = 16777216, count = 1
System info:
------------
Kernel: 2.2.1
Red Hat 5.2, all required packages upgraded for 2.2
HD: Quantum Fireball ST6.4A
AMD K6 233Mhz
64 MB RAM
Regards,
// André
