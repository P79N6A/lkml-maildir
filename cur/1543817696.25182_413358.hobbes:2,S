Since RCU is applicable in read intensive environments and I
look for rcu_dereference() on the read side to be paired with
rcu_assign_pointer() on the update side, I wonder if key_put()
might be redundant or risky after synchronize_rcu(), because 
key_put() opens with if(key) and employs atomic_dec_and_test(&key->usage)) 
before schedule_work(&key_cleanup_task).  If the memory referenced 
by old has already been reclaimed which appears is made possible by 
synchronize_rcu(), it seems that there is a contention here.
Yes, so I guess you mean to get rid of 'old' altogether and the three
lines that refer to it.  But I think the original intent was to have
the former session keyring persist to some extent.
Thanks.
