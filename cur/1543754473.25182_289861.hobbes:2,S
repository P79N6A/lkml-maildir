superio core was not changed much, all related changes were posted into 
lm_sensors mail list and discussed.

acb and gpio are logical devices and are very simple.
It was design task to create such model, where each device is as simple 
as possible, and only handle low-level operations.

Yep %)
SuperIO Control - is a good name, sio_ I've seen somewhere...

GPIO and AccessBus are very simple devices, and I added them just because
1. people often asked exactly about GPIO
2. I had only GPIO and ACB to test. Actually I had a RTC and WDT too, 
but noone never asked in any mail list about them, but I think it worth
to implement.
Addind SuperIO itself does not have much sence that it can not be 
tested without at least one logical device, thus I added two.
Porting existing SuperIO devices to the new schema is a very good task, 
but I had only SC1100 processor and PC87366 chip, so I created and tested 
superio chip drivers for them.

I always appreciate your comments, they are definitely right and helped
me very much.
Thank you.
