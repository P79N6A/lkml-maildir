Can you try either the patch at:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=101588420909194
Or just renaming your usbmodules binary to something else and see if the
problem goes away?
The USB initialization timing changed between 2.4.19-pre1 and -pre2,
fixing a lot of problems with devices that had previously not worked on
Linux, but worked fine on Windows.  Turned out we were wrong on the
timing issues :)
Let me know if this helps or not.
thanks,
