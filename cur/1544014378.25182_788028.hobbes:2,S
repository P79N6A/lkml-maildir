So this means that anything relying on sendpage() is at risk ? What
I find really strange is that I can only reproduce the issue if the
spliced data come from a real interface. If they come from the loopback
or from a file, there is no problem. Maybe the ref counting is different
depending on the origin of the data ?

My question will sound stupid to some of you, but wouldn't increasing
the refcount on those skb solve the problem (and decreasing it once
the skb is effectively sent) ?
