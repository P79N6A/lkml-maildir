Oh, but that is more or less like the IDE options, if I don't read what is
there I can lose my data, specially with this dual p100 neptune I have here
with a buggy CMD640 IDE controler, running 2.5.latest-bk, rock solid! ;) And
IIRC some distros _already_ ship with lm_sensors, for the ones that don't the
current .config in the kernel srpm don't have the lm_sensors stuff selected.
But anyway, the lm_sensors team has to come with answers, if this is not
the case anymore, if some workaround was found, whatever.
People that compile the kernel should better know what he/she ask for...
