[Please start a new thread instead of replying to a diff.
one and changing the subject.]
arch/x86_64/Kconfig.debug has these Kernel hacking options:
[but I'm not talking about 2.6.9; maybe you should/could try
a newer kernel]
config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
        bool "Check for stack overflows"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        help
	  This option will cause messages to be printed if free stack space
	  drops below a certain limit.
config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
        bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.
	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.
