What drains the fifo?
As far as I can see the fifo is filled by the write syscalls, and 
drained by chance if both the reader and the writer have closed their 
handles.

If a thread switch happens in the indicated line, then the reader will 
loop, until it's timeslice expires - one full timeslice delay between 
the two gettimeofday() calls.
Running the reader with nice -20 resulted in delays of 200-1000 ms for 
each write call, nice 20 resulted in no slow calls. In both cases 100% 
cpu load.
