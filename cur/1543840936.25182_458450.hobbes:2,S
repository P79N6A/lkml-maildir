With the new clocksource code, we can (currently just i386, but the
architecture is generic and I'm working on the other arches) make use of
continuous clocksources for accumulating time instead of having the deal
with the problematic PIT (as well as the lost ticks issue).
Maybe I'm missing what you're proposing, but I think "that pit of
madness" can now be avoided. :)
