Hello,
I've a laptop with 2 additional keys for the Euro and Dollar (Acer 
TM8106). 
When I press these keys, I get the following error: 
atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xb3 on
isa0060/serio0). 
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e033 <keycode>' to make it known. 
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xb3 on
isa0060/serio0). 
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e033 <keycode>' to make it known. 
When I use setkeycodes to link a keycode to a scancode, as shown below: 
setkeycodes 0xb3 205 
(I think that this is the same as: 
setkeycodes e033 205 
At least it gives identical results) 
To make the key know as Euro key, I do the following: 
loadkeys << "EOF" 
keycode  205 = currency 
EOF 
This results in a the Euro sign on my console with 
setfont lat0-16 -m 8859-15 
Now my question: 
When I do a showkey -s, I expect that when I press the Euro key, which
I 
just linked to 0xb3 will be shown. But the following is the result: 
showkey -s 
kb mode was XLATE 
press any key (program terminates after 10s of last keypress)... 
0x9c 
0xe0 0x25 
0xe0 0xa5 
What is the reason that the scancode which I set differs from what is 
shown by showkey? 
With kind regards 
Joost Gevers
