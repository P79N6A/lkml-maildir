Question: Is fbdev supposed to work without BIOS? 
I have an ATI Technologies Inc 3D Rage Pro 215GP in an Alpha AXPpci33,
currently running with MILO as firmware/bootloader. 
For several reasons I want to change to the original SRM firmware. 
Unfortunately its intel_cpu/BIOS emulation locks up on the ATI BIOS. With
the BIOS disabled the SRM succeeds loading the kernel. fbdev seems to
initialize _something_, i.e. the monitor wakes up ans displays a stable
repeating pattern of vertical stripes. But it hangs the machine after
these lines on serial console:
fb0: ATY Mach64 frame buffer device on PCI
Installing knfsd (copyright (C) 1996 okir@monad.swb.de).
Booting the same kernel image (2.6.[13]) with MILO (which has a different
cpu emulation that succeeds executing the BIOS) works fine with fbdev. 
Bye,
Thorsten
