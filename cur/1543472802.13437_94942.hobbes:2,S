Evidently you have not noticed the name GNU appears frequently while using
Linux. I strongly disagree that the FSF/GNU is ignored. Stallmans
insistence on renaming Linux GNU Linux is patently nothing more than an
ego trip on his part. While I have appreciated the *results* of the FSF
efforts, I utterly *reject* their "ideology". I really do wish Stallman
would shut up about an ideology the people of the world have rejected and
has been proven to be a total failure.

What you don't say here is the simple fact that it is *stupid* to recode
what the FSF had already done. Linux is *not* dependent upon GNU/FSF.
What dependencies there are are there by convenience not by necessity.
