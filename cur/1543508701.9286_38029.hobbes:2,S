 I am having a huge trouble getting semaphores to work in my code.
The code looks like this:
struct semaphore my_sem=MUTEX;
ioctl_handler()
{
    down(&my_sem);
 ...
     up(&my_sem);
}
in_the_interrupt()
{
     down(&my_sem);
...
     up(&my_sem);
}
 My indended purpose of the semaphore is to avoid the situation when the
code in the "in_the_interrupt" changes stuff while ioctl_handler 
was changing it.
 The driver using this code crashes very soon after loading, in the
with the following fault:
Scheduling in the interrupt
Unable to handle kernel NULL dereference at virtual address 00000000
current->tss.cr3=022e1000 , %cr3=022e1000
*pde=00000000
entering kdb due to panic at 0xc0110b2e
....
stack:
schedule(0xC48ABFF0,0xC0F42D80)
__down(0x48EB02C,0x1,0xC0095B60)
__down_failed(...)
 kdbg shows that the count field of the semaphore == -1.
When I disable interrupts in the ioctl_handler()
the crash goes away, but I would rather avoid disabling all
interrupts (for performance reasons), I only need to protect the
access to my variables.
 I suspect that I don't understand something very fundamental
here, please help :) 
(uh, the kernel is 2.2.10)
 Thanks.
