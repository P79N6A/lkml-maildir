I tried rc6 with DRM turned off.  That kernel consistently _died_ when 
trying to start xdm. Xorg logs for both cards ended like this:
(II) LoadModule: "pcidata"
(II) Loading /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/libpcidata.a
Of course the last block of the log may be lost, as this crash
blocked even sysrq so it is reasonable to assume that the disk drivers
and filesystems froze up too.
I can retry this with a syncronously mounted /var, if the last lines
of the Xorg logs might be interesting.
