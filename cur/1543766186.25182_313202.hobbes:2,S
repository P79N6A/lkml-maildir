Dear diary, on Thu, Apr 21, 2005 at 11:55:43PM CEST, I got a letter
where tony.luck@intel.com told me that...

To set up that, go into your "master" working directory, and do:
	git fork release ~/release
	git fork testing ~/testing
Then in ~/release or ~/testing respectively, you have working trees for
the respective branches.

Currently, git pull will _never_ care about your internal heads
structure in the remote repository. It will just take HEAD at the given
rsync URI, and update the remote branch's head in your repository to
that commit ID.  This actually seems to be one of the very common
pitfalls for people.
The way to work around that is to setup separate rsync URIs for each of
the trees. ;-) I think I will make git-pasky (Cogito) accept also URIs
in form
	rsync://host/path!branchname
which will allow you to select the particular branch in the given
repository, defaulting to the "master" branch.
Would that work for you?
