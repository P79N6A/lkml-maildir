Hi,
I have made a patch for the Xircom PCMCIA Driver against 2.3.18ac5.
But there are still some warnings, knows someone, what's wrong?
In file included from xirc2ps_cs.c:98:
/usr/src/linux.ac/include/linux/module.h:14: warning: `_set_ver' redefined
/usr/src/linux.ac/include/linux/modsetver.h:9: warning: this is the location
of the previous definition
Today i want to get my modem working...
Bye, Mario
