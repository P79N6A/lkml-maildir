So far you've not offered one realistic scenario of "screw up horribly". 
People have been using noatime for a long time and there are no horror 
stories about that. _Which_ OSS HSM software relies on atime?

The patch i posted today adds /proc/sys/kernel/mount_with_atime. That 
can be tested by user-space, if it truly cares about atime.

i did exactly that 6 months ago, check your email folders. I went by the 
"process". But it doesnt really matter anymore, Ubuntu has done the step 
and Fedora will be forced to do it too. But it's sad that it took us 10 
years. I'd like to remind you again:

we really have to ask ourselves whether the "process" is correct if 
advantages to the user of this order of magnitude can be brushed aside 
with simple "this breaks binary-only HSM" and "it's not standards 
compliant" arguments.
