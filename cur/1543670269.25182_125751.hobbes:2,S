 Well, FD 3 could be used instead and "cat firmware_image >&3". shell
 scripts should not be writing to FD 3.

 I don't know that much about sysfs, after a little investigation, it
 seams like sysfs entries are restricted in size to PAGE_SIZE, which on
 i386 is 4K, and ezusb firmware is already 6.9K in size.
 I would really appreciate someone more knowledgeable than myself
 commenting on the possibility of extending sysfs to fill this gap.
 Have a nice day
