Off-by-one there.  You'd want
	for (i = NR_CPUS; --i >= 0; )
or something similarly foul ;)
But these are not performance-critical functions.  And by far the
most inefficient part of them is that they're reading data for
CPUs which cannot exist.   That can be fixed with a `cpu_possible(i)'
test in there, but Rusty was going to give us a `for_each_cpu' macro.
We haven't seen that yet.
