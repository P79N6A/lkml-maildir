Hi,
Here are some minor PCI hotplug fixes for 2.6.4-rc1.  They fix some
oopses, and make the build options a lot saner and allow the distros to
pick the proper options easier.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
