Ok, I see this has started to interfere with the bug tracking process so
I'll kill it now (I seriously thought it was already dead).
Yep it was an april fools joke. 
for the record: 
  2 offers for help; 
  1 post asking me if I mounted a scratch monkey( heh); 
  1 email begging me to abandon the project for the sake of humanity (and
linux' reputation)
And this adds 1 attempt to use it as corroborating evidence. Who knows, it
might have even been this guy's post I ripped the oops from.
