i've read all that thread now and i think all your observations are 
addressed in the latest tree i posted. In fact, most of the 
non-syntactic observations you made i already addressed in my series 
from yesterday. Find the latest tree at:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-kgdb.git
with tip commit 8fbf71f7636bd26843de01b4bdf819c9a9777427. Shortlog and 
diffstat below. I backmerged all the fixlets into their original 
commits, to keep the splitup clean.
Here are my replies to your feedback:

addressed: this was fixed in my submission yesterday.

disagree - the best is to have it in both places - and in many places we 
do that. Anyway, this is up to maintainer discretion.

disagree. Many architectures will select shadow-info support so having 
this in asm-generic/kgdb.h is straightforward. I am actually an 
architecture who had to deal with this stuff in 32-bit (no shadow info 
support) and 64-bit (shadow info support) and this was handy and 
obvious. (But note that the patch submitted by Jason had a few 
uglinesses in this area that i fixed so please re-check the ones in my 
tree.)

yes, eventually we might want to use kgdb earlier than the per CPU areas 
are set up.

agreed, fixed.

maintainer discretion item. I prefer having such clarity in operator 
ordering.

yeah. Agreed about the ugliness and i volunteer to implement any 
sensible suggestions later on :-)

check out the full context, not just the patch. It's often done for a 
reason to make the full visual appearance of that particular code nice.

selecting FRAME_POINTER is totally sensible and other debugging code 
does it too. I agree about the DEBUG_INFO and it was addressed in 
yesterday's series already.
