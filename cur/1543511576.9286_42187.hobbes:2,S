Perhaps it is time to see about expanding the mode bits to include
several more fields (most unused at this time, but I can think of
several -a online/offline flag (file migration), a compressed flag
(file is compressed, may be used with the online flag. (More future
development...)

The display looks fine to me.

the mode bits to include several more fields.

I don't think it will hurt very many scripts - the mode field is not
as usefull as others (byte length, file name, owner). Since it is
still part of the first field there shouldn't too much of a problem.
