Hi Steve,

So, the source files examine the gcc version number and generate different
spinlock_t structures depending on the value of __GNUC__ and __GNUC_MINOR__.
Rules.make runs each source file through cpp and hands it to genksyms, so
genksyms ought to get the appropriate structure for the compiler in use.
I believe that genksyms will do its job correctly here and generate the
appropriate signature for each compiler.  So I believe kernels built
with one compiler will reject modules built with the other compiler,
as they should.
I haven't tested this, but if someone wants to come up with a test case
that proves me wrong, I'd be interested (not like I have any time to *do*
anything about it this month).
And personally, I would rather change asm/*/spinlock.h to use one
structure all the time, and upgrade the structure definition about a
year after the date Linus changes his official compiler recommendation.
