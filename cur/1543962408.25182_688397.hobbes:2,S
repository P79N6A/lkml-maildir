But daily usage stats say something completely different (google):
journaled:   1,540,000 hits
journalized:   129,000 hits
journalised:     8,340 hits
BTW, what is common spelling in the kernel British or American English?
If you search for it with "file system" added, you get:
journaled:     134,000 hits ( 8.7% of above total)
journalized:     3,290 hits ( 2.5%)
journalised:     1,890 hits (22.7%)
So "journalized" is even less common when talking about file systems than it 
is in other contexts.
Guess the high percentage for "journalised" is your doing? ;-)
I don't see this as an improvement.
