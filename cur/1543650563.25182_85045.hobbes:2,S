My first post about epoll pointed out how it was designed for single 
threaded callers and concluded:
I certainly hope /dev/epoll itself doesn't get accepted into the kernel, 
the interface is error prone.  Registering interest in a condition when 
the condition is already true should immediately generate an event, the 
epoll interface did not do that last time I saw it discussed.  This 
deficiency in the interface requires callers to include more complex 
workaround code and is likely to result in subtle, hard to diagnose bugs.
I did not say "the interface has a bug", I said that the interface is 
error prone.  This is a deficiency that should be fixed before the 
interface is added to the kernel.

You posted code which you claimed was "even more cleaner and simmetric" 
(sic) because it fell through to the do_use_fd() code instead of putting 
the do_use_fd() code in an else clause.  A callback scheme is akin to 
the if/else structure.  To adapt the first code to a callback scheme, 
the accept callback has to somehow arrange to call the do_use_fd() 
callback before returning to the event loop.  This requirement is subtle 
and asymmetric.

Basically, you spawn off another coroutine.  That complicates the "fall 
through to do_use_fd()" logic in the first code by requiring an external 
facility not required by the second code.  The second code could simply 
have the accept code loop until EAGAIN.

Aio poll extends the existing set of poll notification hooks with a 
callback mechanism.  It then plugs into this callback mechanism in order 
to deliver events.  The end result is that the same notification hooks 
are used for classic poll and aio poll.  When aio poll is not being 
used, there is no additional performance penalty other than a slightly 
larger poll_table_entry and poll_table_page.
Epoll creates a new callback mechanism and plugs into this new callback 
mechansim.  It adds a new set of notification hooks which feed into this 
new callback mechansim.  The end result is that there is one set of 
notification hooks for classic poll and another set for epoll.  When 
epoll is not being used, the poll and socket code makes an additional 
set of checks to see that nobody has registered interest through the new 
callback mechanism.

This is a comparison of the cost of using epoll to the cost of using aio 
in one particular situation.  It is irrelevant to the point I was making.

My understanding of the efficiency of the epoll event notification 
subsystem is:
1) Unlike the current aio poll, it amortizes the cost of interest 
registration/deregistration across multiple events for a given connection.
2) It declares multithreaded use out of scope, making optimizations that 
are only appropriate for use by single threaded callers.
