Do we care about that?  A straightforward scenario under which this can
happen is:
a) app starts some read I/O in an asynchronous manner
b) app forks
c) child writes to one of the pages which is still under read I/O
d) the read I/O completes
e) the child is left with the old data plus the child's modification instead
   of the new data
which is a very silly application which is giving itself unpredictable
memory contents anyway.
I assume there's a more sensible scenario?
