2.3.22pre2 does this to me:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce
-DCPU=586 -march=i586   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c ksyms.c
ksyms.c:367: `daemonize' undeclared here (not in a function)
ksyms.c:367: initializer element for `__ksymtab_daemonize.value' is not constant
make[2]: *** [ksyms.o] Error 1
Adding this to kernel/ksyms.c does the trick:
extern void daemonize(void);
Now the proper fix is ... ?
And to answer your question, my via rhine card (a D-Link DFE 530-TX
10/100, to answer that question as well) works fine with this patch. There
are some messages at startup, but none that weren't there before.

eth0: VIA VT3043 Rhine at 0xfc80, 00:50:ba:a4:15:86, IRQ 11.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 8, status 0x782d advertising 05e1 Link 0000.
  PCI latency timer (CFLT) is unreasonably low at 32.  Setting to 64 clocks.
It still prints 8 extra "detection" lines:

I believe Donald Becker expressed some thoughts on that before.
