Hi everybody,
I have a question.
Assume that I have a server with very simple network services and only a
few dozen clients, but slow network hardware (eg. 16MBit-TR).
To serve faster, I want to give it more than 1 network card (cpu fast enough).
But: to the clients it should be seen as 1 server and 1 ip-adress
(broadcasting required).
As far as I understood it, "ethernet"-bridging would solve my problem. but:
is that supported with TR? how to use it? I looked in the Ethernet- and
Firewall&Bridging-Mini-Howtos, but couldn't find a good explanation how to
use it.
I didn't try it - but if I give several network cards the same ip-adress,
will it work? i've seen the arp-entries in /proc/net/arp have an interface
with them - is that enough?
thank you for your answers!
ph.
