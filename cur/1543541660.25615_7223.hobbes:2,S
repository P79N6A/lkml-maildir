All-NT systems don't use them; only 9x. So if 
you're serving to all NT clients, no problem. 
That won't be the case for several years at least, 
though. I don't know if Samba could do its own 
name mangling to make up for a lack of it in Linux 
NTFS or not.
I imagine David Cutler wanted to gnaw his own 
fingers off when putting name mangling into NTFS...
DOS compatibility for VMS... yum. I mean, barf.
