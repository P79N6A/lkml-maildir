NAK.  If it's missing the modalias then it needs to be added.  But more
the question is why isn't the driver being automatically loaded.
Probably because hotplug doesn't know enough about the MMC subsystem.
Unfortunately I'm at rather a loss what's required with hotplug because
it isn't something I actually use or come into contact with.
