My test with strcmp (wich is buitin) with gcc-2.7.2.3 and egcs-1.1.2
report:
if compiler found strcmp, use internal buitin, also if I've declared
a strcmp inline.
strlen instead, seem to check if there are an inline function, before
use the strlen-builtin. (strlen is builtin only on egcs).
Also with gcc-2.7.2.3 Horst von Brand PATCH do nothing (the funtions are
already builtin)
