Agreed.

Correction -- the tools that read the text format are buggy if they do 
not transparently support changes to the text format.
(Corollary: the text format is buggy if it does not support a method of 
noticing format changes)
I am planning on adding PCI revision id to the information exported via 
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(pci,...).  Tools which correctly read the 
first-line-format-definition will continue to function as before, 
regardless of additional fields I want to add.  Tools which make silly 
assumptions will have those assumptions come back to bite them ;-)
(tangent warning!)
Another long term idea I would eventually like to realize is the removal 
of device ids from the C source code.  I don't care where they go -- 
drivers/net/pci_ids [per directory ids?], drivers/net/3c59x.meta, 
whereever.  Anywhere but the C source code.  It's quite silly to require 
a driver rebuild just to add a single PCI id, and further, embedding 
metadata in C source is rarely a good idea in the long term.  [reference 
some of Linus's counter-arguments when it was mentioned that Donald 
Becker's method of including Config.{in,help} data in C source might be 
useful]
