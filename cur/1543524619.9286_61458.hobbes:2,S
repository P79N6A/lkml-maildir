I'm using ikd-2.2.12-ikd7.bz2 on a 2.2.12 kernel compiled SMP.
DEBUG_SOFTLOCKUP sounded useful for a problem I was seeing, so
I turned it on.  However it seems to Oops eventually for any
busy or long-lived task.
According to Configure.help entry below, the counter should get reset
when you pass thru schedule().  I can not find where that happens.
    Detect software lockups
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SOFTLOCKUP
      WARNING: This is a brute-force application and will most-likely
               cause a kernel oops.  Use this with extreme caution!
      If you see strange lockups and a kernel hacker told you to 'switch
      on software lockup detection', then this is the right option =B-)
      Do 'make clean' after changing this option!
      For normal systems, this option adds noticeable overhead, so say N.
    Deadlock threshold
    CONFIG_SOFTLOCKUP_THRESHOLD
      The number of procedure calls a process can make without going
      through schedule.  Any process that does more calls than this number
      is "looping".  Alas it does not catch inline procedure calls.
