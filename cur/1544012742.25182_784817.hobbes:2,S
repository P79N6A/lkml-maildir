Hi Helge,

GCC for PA-RISC assumes that the stubs will be placed before the code
section.  This is what HP-UX does.  It's also not possible to compute
the distance to the end of a function in GCC due to the way branch
shortening is done.  If the distance to the start of the code section
is too large, GCC outputs a long call.
If you can insert them before the code section where the stubs are
called, this will minimize the chance that a pc-relative call will
not reach its stub.
It is possible to put the stubs after the code section if you can ensure
the distance for each call isn't too large.  I believe GNU ld does some
consolidation of stub blocks.
Great patch!
Dave
