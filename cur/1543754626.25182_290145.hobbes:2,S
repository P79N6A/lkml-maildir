Just a bit off the topic of this sub-thread...
I'm a bit concerned about this kind of policy and breakage of
userspace APIs going into the kernel. I mean, if an app is
succeeds in gaining SCHED_FIFO / SCHED_RR scheduling, and the
scheduler does something else, that could be undesirable in some
situations.
Secondly, I think we should agree upon and get the basic rlimit
support in ASAP, so the userspace aspect can be firmed up a bit
for people like Paul and Jack (this wouldn't preclude further
work from happening in the scheduler afterwards).
And finally, with rlimit support, is there any reason why lockup
detection and correction can't go into userspace? Even RT
throttling could probably be done in a userspace daemon.
