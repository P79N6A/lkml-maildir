pthread mutex uses futex in nptl and ngpt or they use sched_yield in
linuxthreads, either ways they don't need to flush the tlb. The address
space is the same, no need of changing address space for the mutex
(otherwise mutex would be very detrimental too). Kernel threads as well
don't require a tlb flush.

I was talking about the 2.5:1.5: split here, 3:1 gives you 3G of address
space (both for threads and processes), 2.5:1.5 would give you only 2.5G
of address space to use instead (with a loss of 512m that are being used
by kernel to handle properly a 64G box).

If you noticed Martin mentioned a >30% figure due gettimeofday being
called frequently (w/o vsyscalls implementing vgettimeofday like in
x86-64), this figure it certainly won't sum to your current number
linearly but you can expect a significant further loss by calling
gettimeofday dramatically more frequently.
