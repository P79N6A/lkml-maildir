It's been an important item in my zmailer config ever since
I came across it. I don't want to give up ORBS and have the
50 or so mailing lists under my control flooded with SPAM.

Then why doesn't he do something about it? Servers under his
domain of the net have been relaying spam for ages. Luckily
I don't get those any more.
Btw, linux.com and VA most definately are _not_ in ORBS...

Blocking ORBS because it's network abuse and letting the
spammers through? ROFL

Yes we would. And ORBS does by no means `force their
views on others'. It's a bloody database, they don't
_do_ anything. It's people like DaveM, Matti, Alan or
me who _chose_ to use that database.

Well, in that case it's _their_ choice to get into the
database and be unable to send mail to vger, funet,
nl.linux.org and various other list servers. It's their
choice to be unable to submit bug reports to most of
the Linux kernel developers.
And I don't care. What I want is a higher S/N ration in
my mailbox and ORBS plus a highly tuned .procmailrc do
definately help with that.

Rik
