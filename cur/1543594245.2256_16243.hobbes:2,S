Sorry for jumping in late in this thread....
With respect to Intel- I've had a number of meetings with these folks on just
this topic- mostly trying to work these issues from the *BSD side of our
house.
Basically- as far as I understand what they've said, is that they're trying
to figure out how they can:
	Formulate a different NDA than they currently have set up for
	companies. This NDA means that they can release documents to engineers
	writing software *and* allow the engineers to release a driver under
	some kind of Open Source- *possibly* with a feature set less than that
	described in the documents.
My personal estimation is that they're serious about trying to do this. As the
engineers I've talked to have put it (roughly), "The Intel IP is *not* in the
)!*$)!*$!)*$ Chip APIs!". This will probably take a Very Long Time for them to
implement though. They may not, ultimately,  be able to figure it out. The
jury's still out.
If any of you want to talk to the Intel folks who are dealing with this (at
least from the marketing side of the Lan group), contact me and I can try and
put you in touch with those people.
