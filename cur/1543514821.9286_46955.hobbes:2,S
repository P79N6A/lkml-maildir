I was looking at dmesg this morning after installing 2.3.25 last night
and saw the following:
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000000
... APIC ESR1: 0000000a
APIC error interrupt on CPU#1, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000000
... APIC ESR1: 0000000c
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 0000000a
... APIC ESR1: 00000004
This is a dual celeron 300a with a 66 mhz dakota chipset.  The system
still seems to be working OK.  If this changes at any time I'll post
again.
If there is any more info I can provide, please let me know.
Thanks!
Mark
