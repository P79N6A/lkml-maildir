Quake3's doing something strange with the OSS devices. You can work around it 
in ALSA's OSS emulation by disabling the record features for the quake3.x86 
binary, and it should all work fine.
echo "quake3.x86 0 0 direct" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
echo "quake3.x86 0 0 disable" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/oss
(I gleamed the above from google.com, you might need to modify it slightly).
The intel8x0 driver is probably one of the most widely used ALSA drivers, so 
I'd hope it wasn't broken! My laptop uses the driver, it is superb.
