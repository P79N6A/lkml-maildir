I bet it helps. Something around 100-120 should be fine. Now we need an
exponential function of the priority to assign timeslices to try to
maintain interactivity. This should work :
#define TSDELTA (MAX_TIMESLICE - MIN_TIMESLICE)
#define KTSNORM (TSDELTA * TSDELTA * TSDELTA)
time_slice = MIN_TIMESLICE + (TSDELTA * prio * prio * prio) / KTSNORM;
Or something like :
static const short tsmap[] = {
        10,     10,     10,     10,     10,     10,     10,     10,     10,     11,
        11,     12,     13,     14,     15,     16,     17,     19,     20,     22,
        24,     27,     29,     32,     35,     38,     42,     46,     50,     55,
        60,     65,     70,     76,     82,     89,     96,     103,    111,    120,
};
This is a simple cubic, while a quadratic map looks like :
static const short tsmap[] = {
        10,     10,     10,     10,     11,     11,     12,     13,     14,     15,
        17,     18,     20,     22,     24,     26,     28,     30,     33,     36,
        38,     41,     45,     48,     51,     55,     58,     62,     66,     70,
        75,     79,     84,     88,     93,     98,     103,    109,    114,    120,
};
