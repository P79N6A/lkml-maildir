NFS doesn't necessarily require monotonicity either. The only real
requirement that knfsd has is that the timestamp needs to change every
time the file data (mtime+ctime) and/or metadata (ctime only) is
changed.
Applications like 'make' OTOH, probably would be happier if the
timestamps are guaranteed to be monotonic.
