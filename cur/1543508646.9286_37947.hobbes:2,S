Subject: INN 2.2.1 nnrpd fails in 2.3.17

After upgrading to kernel 2.3.17 on an Intel pentium, and am seeing a
problem with connecting to the INN server (on the same computer.) Both
gnus and telnetting fail.
I can telnet to localhost port 119, but when I issue the "mode reader"
command, innd vforks nnrp which then fails (with no entries in any log
I can find.) Booting back into 2.3.16, everything works fine again. I
have tried rebuilding 2.3.17 with the same results.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to get diagnostics for the failing
process. I have tried strace, but this does not seem to trace past
the vfork into the child process.
Here the strace outputs (in case I have missed something)
