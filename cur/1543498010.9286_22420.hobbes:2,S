As a trivial note, the mouse (CONFIG_INPUT_PSMOUSE & CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEMU) is
*much* faster.  I used to use accel 3 and thresh 3, but w/ the input
patch the default 2/4 is almost that fast.  A thresh of 4 or 5 gives a
similar feel to my old 3/3.
OTOH -- and there may be a way to configure around this -- I've lost
my meta and menu keys in X on my 105-key AT kbd.  My relevant
XF86Config looks like:
Section "Keyboard"
  Protocol      "Standard"
# Protocol      "Xqueue"
  AutoRepeat    500 5
# ServerNumLock
# Xleds         1 2 3
  LeftAlt       Meta    # probably ignored due to Xkb settings
  RightAlt      Meta    # probably ignored due to Xkb settings
  ScrollLock    Compose # probably ignored due to Xkb settings
  RightCtl      Control # probably ignored due to Xkb settings
# XkbDisable   
  XkbKeycodes   "xfree86"
  XkbTypes      "default"
  XkbCompat     "default"
  XkbSymbols    "us(pc105)"
  XkbGeometry   "pc"
  XkbRules      "xfree86"
  XkbModel      "pc105"
  XkbLayout     "us"
  XkbVariant    ""
  XkbOptions    "ctrl:swapcaps"
EndSection
I've gotten rather used to those keys (Meta is a lot better than
escape, and Menu better than M-x) and Alt is taken up by compose-type
features.  Is there any easy way to get them back?  Does it have
something to do with atkbd's set2 vs set3?
Also, evtest.c won't compile on my RH5.2 based system.  evtest.c
includes <linux/input.h> which includes <linux/time.h> and
<asm/types.h>.  There are a number of conflicts between the glibc and
kernel headers.  I hacked a local copy of input.h to get it compiled.
Evtest indicates that the left Meta key is code 127 and the right is
125.  The Menu key is 126.
