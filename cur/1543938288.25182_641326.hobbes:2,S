please get x86.git
  git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
  cd linux-2.6
  #--------------{ x86.git instructions }---------->
  # Add Linus's tree as a remote
  git remote add linus git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
  # Add Ingo's tree as a remote
  git remote add x86 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
  # With that setup, just run the following to get any changes you
  # don't have.  It will also notice any new branches Ingo/Linus
  # add to their repo.  Look in .git/config afterwards, the format
  # to add new remotes is easy to figure out.
  git remote update

  git merge x86/master
  git merge x86/mm
