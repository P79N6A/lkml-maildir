You'll need to be a lot more specific than "platform patches" and "them all".
Patches have names.  I currently have
gpio-framework-for-avr32.patch
avr32-spi-ethernet-platform_device-update.patch
avr32-move-spi-device-definitions-into-main-board.patch
atmel-spi-driver.patch
atmel-spi-driver-maintainers-entry.patch
avr32-move-ethernet-tag-parsing-to-board-specific.patch
atmel-macb-ethernet-driver.patch
adapt-macb-driver-to-net_device-changes.patch
I'd prefer to drop the lot, but we do have those SPI patches which David
needs to see.

So in fact I do think I'd prefer to drop everything.  How about
a) you sort out the SPI patches with David, send them over to me when
   it's ready and
b) everything else goes into Linus from your git tree, and I include
   your git tree in -mm?
(I hope that tree works, btw - for some reason it seems that any git tree
which isn't on kernel.org is down half the time).
