OK, Con was right, and I didn't initially make the connection.
 In 2.6.11, untarring a .tar.bz2 causes tar and bzip2 to run with a
niceness of 10, but everything is fine.
 In 2.6.12, ondemand _only_ has an effect for me in this example if I
put on my admin hat and renice the bzip2 process (tried 0, that works) -
renicing the tar process has no effect (obviously, that part doesn't
push the processor).
So, from a user's point of view it's broken.
