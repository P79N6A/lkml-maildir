This bug is not finding any real issues for us anymore and this rate of 
false positives is a distraction - so i've queued up the patch below in 
tip/x86/urgent.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: tone down mtrr_trim_uncached_memory() warning
kerneloops.org is reporting a lot of these warnings that come due to
vmware not setting up any MTRRs for emulated CPUs:
| Reported 709 times (14696 total reports)
| BIOS bug (often in VMWare) where the MTRR's are set up incorrectly
| or not at all
|
| This warning was last seen in version 2.6.29-rc2-git1, and first
| seen in 2.6.24.
|
| More info:
|   
http://www.kerneloops.org/searchweek.php?search=mtrr_trim_uncached_memory
Keep a one-liner KERN_INFO about it - so that we have so notice if empty
MTRRs are caused by native hardware/BIOS weirdness.
