I'll work on fixing things the patch breaks.  I don't think it will be
that bad.  I've been working on preemption for a long long time, and
before me others have been working for a long long time, and I just
don't see the hordes of broken drivers or the tons of race-conditions
due to per-CPU data.  I have seen some, and I have fixed them.
For a solution to latency concerns, I'd much prefer to lay a framework
down that provides a proper solution and then work on fine tuning the
kernel to get the desired latency out of it.
