exactly, Alan is saying that the hardware optimizations aren't nessasary.
putting an Opteron on a NIC card just to match the other processors in
your system seems like a huge amount of overkill. you aren't going to have
nearly the same access to memory so that processor will be crippled, but
stil cost full price (and then some, remember you have to supply the thing
with power and cool it)

as long as tools are written that have the same command line semantics the
rest of the complexity can be hidden. and even this isn't strictly
nessasary, these are special purpose cards and a special procedure for
configuring them isn't unreasonable.

I'm saying treat the one machine with 10 of these specialty NIC's in it as
a 11 machine cluster, one machne running your server software and 10
others running your networking.
