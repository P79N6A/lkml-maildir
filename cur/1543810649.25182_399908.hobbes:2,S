I hate to keep asking you to test this since you're so busy.  If you know
anyone else with an x86_64 who could investigate instead, don't hesitate
to pass this on.
The only reason this patch set could cause interrupts to get enabled (when
they weren't enabled before) would be if some code was using one of the
blocking notifier chains.  If one of the down_read() or down_write() calls
blocked, the scheduler would enable interrupts.  On the other hand, if
there is only a single task running, how could a down_read() or
down_write() call manage to block?
The diagnostic patch below is a heavy-handed approach, but it ought to
indicate the source of the problem.  Doing anything to a blocking notifier
chain at a time when task switching is not legal should be a no-no.  
Maybe this means that a chain got misclassified as blocking when it
really should be atomic -- or maybe it means there has always been a more
serious problem that has never been detected before.
