When running make clean on an ARM tree, I get:
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `arch/arm/mach-/Makefile'.  Stop.
Seeing as we have many mach-* directories, and the relevant one is
selected by the relevant .config file.
I see two options:
- recurse into the correct one somehow, given that the .config file may
  have changed since the kernel tree was built.
- recurse into all mach-* directories for make clean and not for the
  normal build
(Its late, I've not looked at the makefiles yet)
Comments?
