Ok, then how would you propose to be able to send
packets out an interface _before_ we have addresses
assigned to it?
Linux allows that, and in fact it's a useful feature.
Consider MSG_DONTROUTE as well.
BTW, this ARP source address algorithm we use comes from
ipv6, it would be instructive to go and see why they do
things the way they do.
