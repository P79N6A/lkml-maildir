That's what I had in mind.

Yes, there are. Using the attached scriptlet on a 2.6.1 tree I had
lying around: 
[root@hydra kernel]# /tmp/find-register-sysctl 
/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/drivers/cdrom/cdrom.ko uses register_sysctl
/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/drivers/parport/parport.ko uses register_sysctl
/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/net/appletalk/appletalk.ko uses register_sysctl
/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/net/ipx/ipx.ko uses register_sysctl
/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/net/irda/irda.ko uses register_sysctl
/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/net/sctp/sctp.ko uses register_sysctl
I'm building 2.6.3-bk with allmodconfig now. Once it's done, I'll post
the resulting list. 
#!/bin/sh
KERNEL_VER=2.6.1
for f in `find /lib/modules/${KERNEL_VER} -name "*.ko"`; do 
    nm $f | grep register_sysctl 2>&1 > /dev/null
    if [ "x$?" == "x0" ]; then
        echo "$f uses register_sysctl"
    fi
done
Cheers, 
Muli
