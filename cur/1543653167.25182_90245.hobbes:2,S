Fun for debuggers and tracers, certainly.  It could be made
synchronous by selecting the new tid value and storing it in the
SETTID address before the mm is cloned.

Don't get this in a muddle.  As far as I can tell, the only purpose of
set_tid_address() is to set the address for _CLEARTID_.  (As a bonus,
it returns the tid so that the caller can save the value, but that's
just an optimisation).
So, CLONE_CHILD_SETTID is not at all similar to calling
set_tid_address() in the child.
That said, you're still right.  There should be two flags, and these
are the simple, obvious semantics:
   1. CLONE_SETTID sets the child's tid in the parent's memory.
      In the child's memory, if CLONE_VM is not set, the tid word will
      have whatever value was stored in it before the parent called
      clone().  Unless I've misread the code, this is the behaviour we
      have now.
   2. CLONE_CLEARTID sets tid_address in the child (only the child).
      It is equivalent to calling set_tid_address() first thing in the
      child.
Note that these semantics make sense, and the implementation is very
simple.  There is no problem with allowing CLEARTID always.
The race condition which Ulrich brought up, which requires
CLONE_CHILD_SETTID to be used without CLONE_PARENT_SETTID, only occurs
when using the same address to store the tid of the forked child as
the parent's tid address.  In other words, it's a user space error.
(Please correct me if I'm mistaken, Ulrich).
Finally, it would be kinder to everyone if CLONE_SETTID stored the
child's tid in _both_ the parent and child address spaces, atomically
w.r.t. debuggers.  The simplest way to do that is to store the child's
tid value in the parent's memory before cloning the mm.  If thread
creation fails, that's fine because the parent knows.
