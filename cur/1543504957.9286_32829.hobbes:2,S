Indeed.  With this caveats that
  - on UX one has to reverse core_pyxis.{c,h} changes or your disk
    controller will be mapped outside of an available window (which
    is only 1 GB no matter what you do).  This is not the case with
    other PYXIS machines; at least not with LX
  - via-rhine driver has to have VIA_USE_IO defined or it will not work
  - with NCR controller you better use sym53c8xx - 1.5d driver, plus
    possibly "extra read for a broken PCI" mods posted on this list
    or Gerard Roudier will hit the roof. :-)
Other than that this indeed works just great and some patches fixing
vfork troubles **are** included among other things.
