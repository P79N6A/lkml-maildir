 That's probably true, I'm not expert on the matter. The new subsystem only
 covers platforms that were not covered before (i.e. without external patches),
 so that this should not impact users because the NTP update mode
 was not working on them.
 The problem might arise when other RTC drivers (i.e. x86) will be converted
 and deployed.
 We need a migration plan. Any suggestion?
