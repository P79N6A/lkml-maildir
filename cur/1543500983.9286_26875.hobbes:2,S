If they have no side-effect, they'll compile to *NO CODE*.
It doesn't matter what kassert does in this case.

They are indeed.  Ideally we'd like a GCC __builtin_no_side_effects() to
warn us about expressions with side effects.
Away from the ideal..  assert() has been noted as a cause of subtle bugs
over the years by many folks.  Somehow the fact that `assert' is
different from `any_other_function' seems to pass by a programmer's
mental pattern matching.
It's easy to write correct assert() calls.
But it can be damn hard to spot other peoples' bogus ones.
