Seems that with FIFO fairness, /bin/sync now also livelocks.  And
it's pretty easy to see why.  There's nothing to make
write_unlocked_buffers() terminate.
We'll worry about that tomorrow.  I may just make it give up
after writing (2 * nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY]) buffers.
The patch works well with read-latency2 (and it didn't throw
rejects).  Smooth and fast.  It's going to take some time and
testing to settle everything in.
