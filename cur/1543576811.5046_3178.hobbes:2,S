Yes, this is a very important point if we ever want to make serious use
of large memory machines on ia32. We ran into this with DYNIX/ptx when the
P6 added 36-bit physical addressing. Conserving KVA (kernel virtual address
space), became a very high priority. Eventually, we had to add code to play
silly segment games and "magically" materialize and dematerialize a 4GB
kernel virtual address space instead of the 1GB. This only comes into play
with really large amounts of memory, and is almost certainly not worth the
agony of implementation on Linux, but we'll need to be careful elsewhere to
conserve it as much as possible.
Regards,
Tim
