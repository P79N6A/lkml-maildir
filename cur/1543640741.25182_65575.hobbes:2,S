Subject: [PATCH]: fix 32bits integer overflow in loops_per_jiffy calculation

Hi,
The "low_part * mult" multiplication of the old function may overflow a
32bits integer...
This patch both fix the overflow issue (tested with frequencies up to
20Ghz), and make the result of the function lose less precision.
Please apply,
