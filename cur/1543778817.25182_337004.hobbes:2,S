I wonder which git version is linus.patch updating to, as it certainly isn't
the mostly new git/hg tree (sans ALSA tree merge), as one patch didn't apply cleanly.
(sched-consider-migration-thread-with-smp-nice.patch)
It could be written as a comment, if that's not too hard to do.
What about releasing a secret release just right before -mm in order to avoid
problems like that MTRR problem?
