Have you quite finished?
The problem isn't actually voyager specific ... the compile breaks if
you build UP with no local APIC ... for the same reason (you have apic
dependent variables in generic code).   Whether voyager is converted to
your quirk infrastructure is irrelevant ... doubly so since the failure
can be produced with UP PC x86 which is already converted.
That file is already a forest of #ifdefs:
jejb@hobholes> grep \\#if setup_percpu.c
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_32
#ifndef CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
#if defined(CONFIG_X86_64) && defined(CONFIG_NUMA)
it can't but be otherwise because it's a monolithic initialisation of a
set of variables defined in conditionally compiled files.
