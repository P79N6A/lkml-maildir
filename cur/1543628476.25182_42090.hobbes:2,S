oops, sorry about the trouble.
This time:
+ kbuild-2.5-core-6
+ kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.8-3
+ kbuild-2.5-i386-2.5.8-1
Small issue with generation of defkeymap.c:
i got error that there was no permission to write in the file from
/bin/sh. Sorry, accidentially typed Ctrl-L in terminal and the error was
lost. I'll try to reproduce it (it's not every time).
Btw, why it isn't possible to run "make clean installable"?
Or at least "make clean oldconfig installable"?
