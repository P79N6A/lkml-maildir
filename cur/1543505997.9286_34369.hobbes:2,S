Yes this seems QUITE familiar :(

Seems that linux doesn't have nfs_acl (whatever it is) at all.
(locking usually is f***ed when you mount nfs disk from linux to solaris)
What I have been experiencing is that sometimes I lose files ie.
.Xauthority (which is very frustrating) and sometimes I see files with
'ls' but can't read them or touch then (something about timeout in...)
'truss ls' shows that it hangs somewhere to fseek or something.
At the moment it might not be smartest choise to use linux with knfsd as
nfs server for multiple platforms (solaris(big trougles),netbsd(small
troubles),linux(this works))
Although I can only talk of combination of linux 2.2.9 and knfsd-1.4.6-1
