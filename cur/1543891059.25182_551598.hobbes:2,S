Subject: SELECT() returns 1 But FIONREAD says (Input/output error)

i am using the GARMIN_GPS/usb driver to read a gps receiver.
In testing the ability of my software to recover from various errors, I 
try this: unplug the gps/USB cable from the usb hub.
Interestingly enough the thread spins.
the SELECT() waits for something to happen, and I get one channel that 
something interesting happened.
Then i try to find out how many chars are in the read buff via FIONREAD. 
That call errors out with an i/o error.
Needless to day, the code resets the SELECT parameters, and SELECT is 
called again. It again says that something interesting has happened on 
that ( i/o errored ) channel. And we now repeat the  FIONREAD.
In this case what, will reset the "something interesting has happened" 
report from the SELECT call? Will it ever be reset in this case?
