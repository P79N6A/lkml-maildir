It's a design that Novell uses to gross more $$$$$$$ routinely in one
month than Linux has brought in with all the Linux companies revenues
combined in the past five years.  :-) 
It is fine for occasional access of nwfs

Dear Pavel,
Wasn't trying to push anything, there are lots of people who want
NetWare stuff, just trying to make Linux more attractive to Novell's
9,000,000 server installed base and get the NetWare file system on Linux
out the door.  You guys are always welcome to carve up NWFS like a
christmas turkey and chunk the pieces that don't make sense for Linux
moving forward.  You'll find I'm not too religious about the sanctity of
my own code, I'd rather be a contributor and team player with you guys. 
:-)  
With the page cache, the file systems in Linux are more or less reduced
to meta-data drivers (very similiar to where NT is at today).  The extra
layers are not really all that heavy, and are there to support our
clustering stuff (which we will open source as well).   Most of them use
fast paths in the code (which you will see if you take the time to look
at it).  Unlike most of the File System code in Linux, NWFS has
COMMENTS, NOTES, EXPLANATIONS, DETAILED TECHNICAL INFO, etc.  :-)
You guys might learn something by looking at it.  I am right at this
moment staring at the NCPFS code in 2.3.99Pre3 since there is NO
DOCUMENTATION ON THE PAGE CACHE, DCACHE, VFS or anything else here to
help besides pouring over source code.  :-)
Don't knock NetWare til you try it. :-)  
Your friend,
Jeff
