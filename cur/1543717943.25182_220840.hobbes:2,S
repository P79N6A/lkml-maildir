I would propose that as the first step: If this fails, then you can try 
to get support from NVidia.
 From you description it doesn't look like a bug directly in the 
forcedeth driver: Perhaps a problem with a shared interrupt, or the vesa 
bios uses an area for I/O and the ethernet registers are remapped on top 
of the vesa registers.
Could you post lspci -vxx from both before and after loading forcedeth. 
Or try bios settings that sound like Plug-N-Play aware OS. Or try ACPI 
instead of APM (I've seen a boot log that contains both acpi and apm - 
which one do you use? Try to boot with "acpi=off", "pci=noacpi", etc.)
