that's really a good result, and this is a benchmark that is realistic
for a number crunching load, I'm running it too on my hardware right now
(actually I started it a few hours ago but it didn't finish a pass yet).
I'm using DOUBLE. However I won't post the quips, I draw the graph
showing the performance for every working set, that gives a better
picture of what is going on w.r.t. memory bandwidth/caches/tlb.
BTW, which is the latest 4:4 patch to use on top of 2.4? I'm porting the
one in Andrew's rc3-mm4 in order to run the benchmark on top of the same
kernel codebase. is that the latest one?

we perfectly know that the biggest slowdown is in mysql-like and
databases running gettimeofday, they're quite common workloads. Numbers
were posted to the list too. vgettimeofday mitigates it.

yes, that's also why threaded apps are hurted most. And due the
serialized copy-user probably you shouldn't enable the threading support
in apache2 for 4:4. Did you get the 5% slowdown with threading enabled?
I'd expect more if you enable the threading, partly because 3:1 should
run a bit faster with threading, and mostly because 4:4 serializes the
copy-user. (OTOH not sure if apache does that much copy-user, in the
past they used mmapped I/O, and mmapped I/O should scale well with
threading on 4:4 too)

they were already posted on the list.

Agreed, I define very large as >32G (32G works fine w/o it).
The number crunching simulations using 4G address space at the expense
of peforming syscalls and interrupts slower is a small amount of
userbase (and even before they care about 4:4 they should care about
mapbase), these are the same users that asked me the 3.5:0.5 in the
past. The point is that these users gets a mmap(-ENOMEM) failure if they
need more address space, so it's easy to detect those users (and most
important they're always very skilled users capable of recompiling and
customizing a kernel) and to provide them specialized kernels, their
application will just complain with allocation failures.  All the rest
of the userbase will just run slower and they'll not know they could run
faster without 4:4.
I provided 3.5:0.5 kernel option + your mapbase tweak for ages in all
2.4-aa for the people who needs 3.5 of address space in userspace. 4:4
adds up another 512M so it's better for them indeed.

I thought hz 1000 would hurt more than %0.02 given 900 irqs per second
themselfs wastes 1% of the cpu, but I may very well be wrong about that
(it's just your previous post wasn't convincing due the apparently
too artificial testcase), anyways the hint is a lot more convincing now.
I will still try to reproduce your HINT numbers here on slightly
different high end hardware, so you can get a further confirmation and
datapoint.
thanks.
