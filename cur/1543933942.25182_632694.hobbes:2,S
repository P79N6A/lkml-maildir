but that does not matter at all: that's not '90s era hardware that we 
are (slightly) worried about wrt. IO delays in misc_32.c. (i.e. on 
_real_ ISA systems)

of course, since VGA is implemented in the southbridge or on the video 
card, so it's much faster than a true ISA cycle.
the only (minor) worry we have here is really ancient systems relying on 
delays there. Modern VGA hardware most definitely does not need any such 
delays.
