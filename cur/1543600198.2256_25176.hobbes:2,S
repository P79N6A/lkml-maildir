I'm  curious, Alan, Why? I'm a hardware developer, and I would have assumed 
that linux would have been ideal for real time / embedded projects? (routers 
/ controllers / etc.) Is there, for instance, a reason to suspect that linux 
would not be able to respond to interrupts at say 8Khz?
of course I know nothing of rtlinux so I'll read.
TIA
Fred
