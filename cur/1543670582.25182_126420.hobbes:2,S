Patch for 2.5.68 is at usual place
(
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest
). I think that there 
is regression in handling cursor on other heads than primary one, 
but I can confirm it only on tuesday, as my current system has only
one video output.
I have no plans about submitting fixes to Linus, so please next time
before reporting problem try latest updates from my ftp. It is well
known that matroxfb does not build, and it will stay that way until
I'll get satisfied with quality of driver & interaction with fbdev
& fbcon level. I think that it is better to have no driver than
driver without cursor...
