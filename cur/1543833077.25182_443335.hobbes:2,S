I tried this long ago, but found that glibc uses sysctl in each
program to get the kernel version. It probably handles ENOSYS,
but there might be slowdowns or subtle problems from it not knowing
the kernel version.
So I think it's ok to remove the big sysctl, but at a very minimal
replacement that just handles (CTL_KERN, KERN_VERSION) is needed.
Also it's useful to printk for the rest at least for some time 
so we know what uses it.
