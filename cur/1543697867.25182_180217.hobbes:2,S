In the end we're going to have a design and we're going to do it
right, if we decide to do this.
Sun needs fast paths, not us.

The initial prefetches are consumed by the copy implementation
setup instructions.  By the time the real loads execute, the
data is there or not very far away.
This I have measured on UltraSPARC, I suspect other cpus can
match that if not do better.

Not true, once you have ~300 or so bytes you have enough inertia
to get a good stream going in the main loop, really look at the
ultrasparc-III stuff I wrote for heuristics.
You really should write the k8 code before coming to conclusions
about what it would or would not be capable of doing :)
