I'm worried the page is freed before it has a chance to be found in the
freelist in smp. The refill_freelist logic is broken too and right fix
would be much more invasive than the above one liner, we should return
one bh with b_count just set to 1 to be sure it's not collected away
under us and we have to try again. But this one probably will do the
trick too for now. and maybe it really doesn't matter as you say.
And also the get_hash_table need to touch the buffer since reiserfs
makes heavy use if it.
just a few ideas.
