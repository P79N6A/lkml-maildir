No that's wrong. And your patch is just a hack that happens to mask the
issue in the case you tested, and it will probably blow up in production
at some stage (consider the case where the VFS cache page is not freeable
or that page is being used for something else).
With the nommu kernel, you actually *do* have a huge reason to write
special code: large anonymous memory allocations have to use higher order
allocations!
I haven't actually written any nommu userspace code, but it is obvious
that you must try to keep malloc to <= PAGE_SIZE (although order 2 and
even 3 allocations seem to be reasonable, from process context)... Then
you would use something a bit more advanced than a linear array to store
data (a pagetable-like radix tree would be a nice, easy idea).
You are of course free to put that patch into your product's kernel
(although I would advise against it, because it has a lot of deadlock
issues)... but the reality is that if you want a robust system, you
cannot just take a unix program and run it unmodified on a nommu kernel
AFAIKS.
