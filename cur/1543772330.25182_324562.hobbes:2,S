Yes, we need that for IA64 as well. i did put that in my notes tbd, but 
didnt turn around doing it yet. 
Think we also need to define the same for asm-ia64/acpi.h FLUSH_CPU_CACHE
i will try updating both in next.
If you have a targetted test that causes the corruption that would be great
so we can add to our stress test senarios.
Cheers,
