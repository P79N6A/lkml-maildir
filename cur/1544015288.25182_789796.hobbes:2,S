| Ok, I tested this in my L2TP setup. The first ppp session setup fails
| because the PPPIOCNEWUNIT ioctl returns -EEXIST. I think the problem is
|  the logic in ppp_create_interface(), which does the following to create
| a new ppp interface:
| 
|         /* Initialize the new ppp unit */
|         ppp->file.index = unit;
|         sprintf(dev->name, "ppp%d", unit);
| 
|         ret = register_netdev(dev);
| 
| Looks like there is more work to do in the ppp changes.
