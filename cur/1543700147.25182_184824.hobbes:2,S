Hello,
Before install Debian GNU/Linux Woody on this box, i have ran memtest
with a bootable media and have no error after 13 pass. But i have added
memory after. It comes from an other PC running perfectly with this. So
i think it could come from the memory but if you want i can launch
memtest again this night ;).
Thanks for your help.
