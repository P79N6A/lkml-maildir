Hello!

Yes!
Size of patch and "simplicity" are orthogonal things.
It was simple like potatoe.

Nice. I agreed. I talk about other thing: after applying Andrew's patch
I saw good correct code. After you will fix all the devices, your patch will
be the same 140K or more due to killing refs t dev->name announced
to be illegal. 8)

Sorry? Why?

Provided you teach me some way to generate unique identifiers, different
of device names.

Probably, I am looking into different code, but I found only 15 references
to new interface.
