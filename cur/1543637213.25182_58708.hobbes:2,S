We went through this with sync() a while ago. You don't want things to
loop forever. That's what status returns are for, if the program wants to
retry it can. Consider the f/s being out of space, the write can't work,
the process can't die, the f/s can't unmount because there's i/o in
progress, the system can't shutdown cleanly.
Let the program handle the problems, and decide what to retry.
