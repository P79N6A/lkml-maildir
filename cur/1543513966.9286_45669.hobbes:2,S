Hi all,
I've recently got myself a new crash-box, a vintage dual Pentiums (HP
XU 5/75 upgraded with 2 P133), which, while perfectly working with
2.2.12, shows some nice "features" with 2.3.23.
On this machine, detected CPU and system clock speed are quite bogus
while running 2.3. It also seems to depend on the presence of the mtrr
module... Quite strange...
2.2.12 : Looks perfect (Bus = 66MHz, CPU = 133MHz)
Oct 24 21:17:33 if kernel: CPU0: Intel Pentium 75 - 200 stepping 0b 
Oct 24 21:17:33 if kernel: calibrating APIC timer ...  
Oct 24 21:17:33 if kernel: ..... CPU clock speed is 132.9567 MHz. 
Oct 24 21:17:33 if kernel: ..... system bus clock speed is 66.4782 MHz. 
2.3.23 (without mtrr) : Strange... looks like a P120...

2.3.23 (with mtrr) : WTF ???????
