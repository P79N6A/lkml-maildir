Well, I just investigated a bug report in the SCSI transport class.  Our
SMP handler is broken in exactly the same way.  We rely on the incoming
reported request lengths to size our request data, and they've blown up
from the true length to 512 bytes (the size of our alignment).
With the original patch, I have to run through the whole of libsas and
scsi_transport_sas doing
s/data_len/raw_data_len/
With your update it looks like I have to run through them all doing
s/data_len/data_len - extra_len/
which is even worse.  Can't we put things back to a point where data_len
means exactly that and extra_len means how much we have spare on the
end, so you know you can DMA up to data_len + extra_len if need be?
That way we don't have to sweep through every block driver altering the
way it uses data_len.
