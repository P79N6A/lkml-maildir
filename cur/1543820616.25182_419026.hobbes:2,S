Sorry for attaching the whole module. 
Initially I thought of sending only the part which is causing the
problem, but
later thought of sending full module which is compiling and working for
better understanding.
In my code inside 'test_scan_bus' I am calling 'pci_do_scan_bus' in that
case I am getting the segmentation fault.
I am developing a test suite which will validate all the BSPs. 
That's the reason I am calling this exported APIs from the subsystem to
verify that things are working fine.

I am not trying to set up the already set up bus ( or is it what I am
doing by making a call to this function?). My intention is to call all
the APIs provided by all the subsystem of the system, like PCI, USB,
UART, FS etc...
I am doing something seriously wrong over here?
Thanks
