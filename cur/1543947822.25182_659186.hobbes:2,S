Well, this sounds strange. Are you sure you're entering the boot options
correctly on the kernel command line? Which is your boot loader? I just booted
my machine with 'hdc=noprobe'  (hdc is my cdrom drive) and here's what i get:

so it seems you should check whether your kernel is receiving the 'hda=noprobe'
boot option at all, or something along that path is going wrong...

are you sure you're _really_ using 2.6.25-rc2? Applying the patch against that
kernel works just fine, no fuzziness or even rejects. Care to try out on a fresh
kernel source tarball? After all, building a kernel with your quad core cpu won't
take that long :-) when using make -j8 or something in that order.
