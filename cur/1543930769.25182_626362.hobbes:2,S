Hey, Daniel,
I'm just getting around to looking at this.  One thing jumped out at me:
> +	if (bio->bi_throttle) {
> +		struct request_queue *q = bio->bi_queue;
> +		bio->bi_throttle = 0; /* or detect multiple endio and err? */
> +		atomic_add(bio->bi_throttle, &q->available);
> +		wake_up(&q->throttle_wait);
> +	}
I'm feeling like I must be really dumb, but...how can that possibly
work?  You're zeroing >bi_throttle before adding it back into
q->available, so the latter will never increase...
