Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.19-rc4 - netlink messages created with bad flags in soft_irq context
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've got a kernel built where 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
is in the config and I've noticed some interesting behavior when
bringing up bonds in balance-alb mode.  When I start to enslave devices
to a bond I get the following in the ring buffer:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at mm/slab.c:3007
in_atomic():1, irqs_disabled():0
along with a nice backtrace of the error that pointed to the cause of
this message.  The bonding code was calling for the device to set its
MAC address and the netlink message that would be send as a result of
this notification was being created with the flag GFP_KERNEL instead of
GFP_ATOMIC.  
After I did this, I noticed I didn't completely clear the error (since
this call eventually tries to talk the rtnl_lock), but it gets us
closer.  I'm still trying to decide how best to approach the remaining
problem and will hopefully post a solution soon, but I wanted to get
this in and/or get some feedback on this patch/direction first.
