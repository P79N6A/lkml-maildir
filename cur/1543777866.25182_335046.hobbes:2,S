while i do like the PREEMPT_RT results, i think we need to do two more 
things to have total confidence in the numbers:
 - i think we'll need to increase the number of sample points, by both
   increasing the frequency of samples, and by lengthening the
   test-time - even if just for a single testrun. Some of the worst-case 
   latencies i care about in PREEMPT_RT trigger only once every couple 
   of million interrupts (!). For human interactivity we probably dont 
   care that much though.
 - many of the worst-case latencies relate to some sort of extreme 
   situation within a particular algorithm. E.g. lots of tasks being 
   around. Do this for example:
	hackbench 50
   and Ctrl-Z it after a couple of seconds. You'll see a 1msec (or 
   larger) blip.
   or, fill up swapspace, so that the swap allocation map gets filled
   up.
 - networking is another frequent source of latencies - it might make 
   sense to add a workload doing lots of socket IO. (localhost might be 
   enough, but not for everything)
