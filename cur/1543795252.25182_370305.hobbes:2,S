Great, thanks for the help in understanding this.  The ENOTRECOVERABLE 
made
no sense to me either.
I'll keep things the way they are.  The code returns -EOWNERDIED to the 
waiter/
new lock owner and the owner can recover the mutex, if they so choose.

Yes, even in the kernel I'd like to see the performance penalty for 
robustness
be an option that the user can select if they want the trade off of
robustness for a slower exit path.

I agree, the PI and Robustness are two logically separate functions and
could easily be separated out.  I'll start on that now.

Excellent!  I hope to have some patches for you in a while.
