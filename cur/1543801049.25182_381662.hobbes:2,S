Bad comparison.  X as it is is so good that if you want something
remotely looking like performance you end up with a proprietary kernel
module the size of Cleveland.
Software mixing in practice could be in the kernel, it's for instance
way less complex than say the network stack.  I mean, even with an
helper thread, it fits in 20-30 lines of kernel code or so.  But what
happens is that you quickly want much more than that.  To give you
some examples:
- resampling (with a wide array of algorithms with a different cpu
  usage/result quality mix), especially since a number of chips are
  48KHz only.
- AC3/DTS encoding for multichannel output on spdif.
- spatialisation (virtual or real, depending on the hardware
  available).
- dynamic range compression.
So as soon as you build some decent infrastructure to allow for that
in userspace, having software mixing specifically in the kernel does
not make much sense.
I have 3 main problems with ALSA, but using userspace for flexibility
is definitively not one of them.
  OG.
