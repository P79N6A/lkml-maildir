Hi
Where can I get information about using linux kernel threads? Can anyone
give me some pointers?
Is there any function that I can use to exit from a thread? The
exit_thread() function of linux kernel 2.4.19 for i386 platform doesn't
seem to be doing anything.
If I can replace threads by tasklets, which would be advantageous in terms
of performance?
thanks & regards
Madhavi.
