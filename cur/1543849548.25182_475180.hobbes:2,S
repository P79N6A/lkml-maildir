Well, looking at do_wp_page() I'm now quite concerned about ARM and COW.
I can't see how this code could _possibly_ work with a virtually indexed
cache as it stands.  Yet, the kernel does appear to work.
I'm afraid I'm utterly confused with the Linux MM in this day and age, so
I don't think I can even consider commenting on this change.
The majority of ARM caches are VIVT, so data read via the kernel mappings
definitely does not hit the same cache lines as data accessed via the user
mappings.
Our copy_user_page() function merely copies between the two kernel mappings
of the pages so with VIVT caches the kernel mappings - as it always has done
since it's original invention.
However, when I look at this code now, I see _no where_ where we synchronise
the cache between the userspace mapping and the kernel space mapping before
copying a COW page.
So I'm afraid I'm going to have to hold up my hand and say "I don't
understand the Linux MM anymore".
