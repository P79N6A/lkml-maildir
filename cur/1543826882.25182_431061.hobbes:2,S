Actually, that isn't quite true.  One of the ways klibc is kept small
is by not guaranteeing a stable ABI... and not having compatibility
support for older kernels.  This is one of the kinds of luxuries that
bundling offers.
Does it make bundling mandatory?  Not really.  In fact, people have
been using klibc in its standalone form for years.  However, I believe
there would be a lot of resistace to have the kernel tarball have
outside dependencies on anything but the most basic build tools.
