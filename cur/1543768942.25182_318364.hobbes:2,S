Are you sure mainline does it for fsync() file data at all? iirc it
was only done for journal writes in reiserfs/xfs/jbd. However since
I suppose a lot of disks flush everything pending on a flush cache
command it still works assuming the file systems write the 
data to disk in fsync before syncing the journal. I don't know
if they do that.
