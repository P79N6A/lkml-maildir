   I have some more information regarding this ide filesystem corruption.
   I did not make one point very clear in my first email:
   I ran "e2fsck -vyf" only on hda1 and only one time.  The other two
   partitions, hda2 and hda5 have not been written to at all.
   I have tried all kinds of things to access my data today.  I was able to
   set up the old system board that I thought had died and was able to get it
   to boot.  I ran an 'e2fsck -vnf' on the partitions, and all three were
   corrupted, with hda1 being the most messed up.
Are you sure that you didn't get your partition table smashed?  If
e2fsck isn't given the proper filesystem boundaries, it's not going to
do anything useful.  That would explain why your hda5 partition is
smashed:
e2fsck 1.18, 11-Nov-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
e2fsck: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/hda5
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
