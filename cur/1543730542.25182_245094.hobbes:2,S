	Ok, I got it. So we have to do this:
1) If I have 2.6.8 and I want upgrade it to 2.6.8.1, I apply the
2.6.8.1 patch
2) If I have 2.6.8.1 and I want upgrade it to 2.6.8.2, I have to remove
2.6.8.1, so it can go back to 2.6.8 and I can apply the 2.6.8.2
directly on the 2.6.8 kernel. This is valid for any 2.6.8.x version for
instance...
3) Finally, if I have 2.6.8.x kernel and I want upgrade it to 2.6.9, I
can just remove the 2.6.8.x patch and apply 2.6.9 on 2.6.8 as I'm used
to do.
	Ok, it seems reasonable now. Thank you very much.
