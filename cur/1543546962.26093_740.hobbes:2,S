The es137x based cards seem to vary in their handling of input
impedance with respect to the microphone.  You may want to try
flipping the input impedance of the microphone input from its default
value.  Use the micbias directive to the module load, e.g.:
	insmod es1371 micbias=1
Also make sure that the microphone is selected as the recording source
and the level is turned up.
