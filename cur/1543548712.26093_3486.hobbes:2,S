I have a lot of doubts about kernel threads.
I have read somewhere that in a kernel thread the stack can't be used
because there is no copy-on-write. I want also to know if I can make any
syscall from a kernel thread.
When I call kernel_thread, the process is cloned whith the CLONE_VM flag
set. Does it mean that when I do a mmap in the kernel thread is it done in
the parent process too?
Thanks in advance.
