It's me again...
Last night I spent over 2 hours trying to figure
out what module 'net-pf-17' mapped to (yes I did
figure it out... af_packet.o).  While arguments
can be made about this being a *HEALTHY*
experience, it did turn into a *BIG* waste of
time.  I *REALLY* think it would be nice if
module mapping information like this either be
added to devices.tex (and devices.txt), or put
in a separate file in the
/usr/src/linux/Documentation directory.  This
file should probably include common module
mappings for: 'net-pf-*', 'binfmt-*', and
'tty-ldisc-*'.
Comments?
Thanks in advance,
Loren
