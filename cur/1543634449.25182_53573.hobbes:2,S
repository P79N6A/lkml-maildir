Current driver is 2.0.30...
And would not have been easier to get it from 2.5 ? You just have
good Makefiles, instead of hacking those from Intel, that I suppose
are prepared for building separate from kernel tree.
Or just take it from jam2...I have been using both e100 and e1000
in the same cluster and no problem with them.
Btw, would you mind mergin also e1000...? ;).
