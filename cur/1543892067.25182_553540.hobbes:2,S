For all I can tell, if this is the case, then CONFIG_X86_TSC should be
removed completely.  We still support the TSC when CONFIG_X86_TSC is not
compiled in; that attribute controls if it is unconditionally required.
(We seem to still not always use it, which may be a good indication that
CONFIG_X86_TSC has outlived its usefulness.  Should it be removed?)
