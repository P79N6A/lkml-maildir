I see, thanks.  How very peculiar.
I wonder if we just got unlucky and that particular benchmark with that
particular kernel build just happens to reach the cache system's
associativity threshold, and this one extra cacheline took it over the
edge.  Or something.
But if that was the case, one would expect even a small change to the
kernel (say, a different compiler version, or different config) would
improve things a lot, or would worsen things a lot.
I think the change is right.  But, again, I worry that any teeny change we
make in there in the future will bring the problem back.
