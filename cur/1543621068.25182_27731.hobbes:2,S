Yeah, seems gcc is a bit lacking in its overclever printf handlers. It
lacks the ability to declare additional non standard % code - despite the
fact glibc itself expands on the standard
       glibc 2.0 adds conversion characters C and S.
       glibc  2.1  adds  length modifiers hh,j,t,z and conversion
       characters a,A.
       glibc 2.2 adds the conversion character F with C99  seman-
       tics, and the flag character I.
So how do they modify the printf format rules in gcc ?
