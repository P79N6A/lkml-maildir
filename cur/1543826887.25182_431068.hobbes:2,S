Quoting Alan Cox:

|  > +  UDP-Lite introduces a new socket type, the SOCK_LDGRAM (note the L) for
|  > +  lightweight, connection-less services. These are the socket options:
| 
|  This is not the intended use of the socket API when distinguishing
|  between services. The socket() call has a protocol field that is usually
|  unused and it exists precisely to disambiguate multiple protocols with
|  the same generic behaviour but different properties.
| 
|  	s = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE);
| 
|  is probably the right way to do this, keeping 0 "default" as before
|  meaning IPPROTO_UDP
Understood. Please, anyone, disregard or un-apply the previous UDP-Lite patch.
A revised patch will be prepared and posted as soon as testing permits.
