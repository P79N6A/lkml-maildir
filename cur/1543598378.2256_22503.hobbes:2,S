Oh, I agree that a need exists for this kind of semantic.  I was just 
saying that we do have a place to add the info necessary for it.  We could 
add it to signal_struct, or we could create another structure that's shared 
in a similar fashion.
We can easily add the concept of 'thread group leader'.  We already have 
the task that has 'tgid == pid', ie the first task that called clone() with 
CLONE_THREAD.  It would be simple enough to expand on that.
Actually the signal semantics you want in the kernel aren't necessarily 
just an implementation of the POSIX process-wide semantic.  What you want 
is to assume there's a library that's implementing the semantic, and funnel 
the signals to it.  Directing them all to a single task (thread group 
leader, for example) is one good way to do it.
