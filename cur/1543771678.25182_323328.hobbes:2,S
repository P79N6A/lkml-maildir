Subject: [PATCH] save 4 bytes in "thread_struct" by changing fs/gs to "unsigned short"

Hi HJLu, Linus, Arjan,
Now that all users of fs and gs fields of "thread_struct" have been switched
to use "mov" instead of "movl" (newer binutils requirement), why not save
4 bytes switching those fields to 16-bit data types. 
No big deal, but as we say around here, "grain by grain the chicken gets fat".
