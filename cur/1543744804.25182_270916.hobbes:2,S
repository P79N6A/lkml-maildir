could you make a patch for the above part? I agree likely we've to work
on the shrink_cache stuff to fix it.
Your patch does many things, some of which I believe it's wrong, but you
can split it, and take care of the above part so Chris can test it in
the meantime. In the spare time of the weekend I'm trying not to do
linux coding since I've to code for a private project that has to keep
going, so I'll move the oom killing in page_alloc.c only tomorrow (it
won't take very long to do it at it will at last fix one strict bug,
that your patch didn't fix competely and it'll avoid the complexity of
message passing to do it).
But today you can already post your change for the above sc->priority !=
DEF_PRIORITY if you think it's correct, I don't see why you need to wait
for my patch before posting it (they're pretty orthogonal, I didn't mean
to change shrink_cache at all but just to fixup and serialize the oom
invocation by moving it in page_alloc.c).
