I'm working on this now.  [For some obscure reason I received your reply to
Adrian only a couple of minutes ago.]
Still I'd like to separate it from the console-related changes in
kernel/power/user.c that are needed for the userland suspend, so I'd like
to split the dropped patch in two.
I've already sent the kernel/power/user.c changes in a separate patch,
and I'll send the drivers/base/power/suspend.c changes when I test them
(in a while).
