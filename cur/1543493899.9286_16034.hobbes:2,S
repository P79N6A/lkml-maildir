It doesn't.  The main difference between those two examples is that one
shows accessing ISA memory (ie. the memory region between 640K and 1MB
on a PC), and the other is accessing PCI memory.  PCI requires ioremap.
ISA doesn't (for now --- this is likely to change).

Yes.

Good question.  If you look at linux/include/asm-i386/io.h, you'll see
that readb etc. perform a __io_virt() on the address, which
essentially forces the address into the kernel's virtual address mapping
region.  The only reason for this is so that you can use both ISA
addresses and kernel virtual addresses safely inside read*/write*().  As
the result of an ioremap() is guaranteed to be in the kernel VA already,
readb() should be identical to a direct lookup of the memory address,
and there should be no need to special-case it out.
