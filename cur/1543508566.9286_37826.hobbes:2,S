yes, modern, high-density ide disks are quite nice.  note though
that they don't require udma66 to perform this well:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  1.04 seconds =123.08 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.16 seconds =20.25 MB/sec
that's a maxtor dm+ 5120 on a bx system (udma33).
