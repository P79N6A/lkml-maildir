Yes, I've found those to be quite nice. I'll try to remember to send my own.

Hmm.. What is the gain of having two tree instead of just more branches?

This should be equivalent of just keeping the "for-linus" branch around
as it will just fast-forward along with Linus' tree when it doesn't
contain any local changes. Or am I missing something?

In other words, you destroy all the old history of your ALL branch and
create a new one? So you couldn't continuously pull from that branch?

My intention was always to send him everything but the most trivial patches.
On questions related to that though. Previously, I've always sent plain
patches to Andrew. After they have simmered a bit in -mm, he usually
pushes them on to Linus, even though they do not qualify as being just
bug fixes. As I will now be the one moving stuff from "from-andrew" to
"for-linus", will the decision of what to move now fall on me? I would
probably be more inclined to wait for the next merge window than Andrew is.
Thanks
