Actually I have seen friendly communities around Linux and free software. 
Like the KDE project, the ck patchset mailing list community, the 
TuxOnIce aka suspend2 community, the SGI XFS community, the Bazaar 
community, quite some parts of the Debian community just to name a few.
So I know that it can be different. I know that its inaccurate to talk 
about the whole Linux kernel community. I had quite friendly contacts 
with core Linux developers like with Ingo (yes, with Ingo!;-) or Greg 
Kroah-Hartman.
So what would be wrong with looking at how this worked out and why and how 
it would be possible to avoid loosing a talented developer?
