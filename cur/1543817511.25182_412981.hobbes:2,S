If a device belongs to a bus, dev->bus will be non-NULL.  I don't see
what "every device is supposed to belong to a bus" fits with the problem.

If the device's dev->bus is NULL, we don't register it on the parents
bus, but we do register it in the device tree as a child of the parent
device.
I think there's confusion here.
