They're private functions (The Standard explicitly says so).
That being the case, it's not the job of the glibc developers to find out
if anybody uses internal entry points. That doesn't make sense.
Instead, it's the job of the StarOffice people to send a mail to glibc-bugs
stating "we need feature FOO which currently seems to be provided only by
internal entry point _BAR, can you fix that / is there a better way to do
what we want".
