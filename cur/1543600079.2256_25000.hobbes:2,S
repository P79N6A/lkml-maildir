At the end of sender. Receiver side is not so interesting.
Well, if you were able to make it with solaris this would be also interesting.
It would be clear how exactly it miscalculates rtt at least. :-)
But Linux is interesting too. Theoretically it should show better times
even with so short transfer. cwnd stays at 1 and this is very strange.
