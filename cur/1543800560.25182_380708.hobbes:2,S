Well, from the original messages in this thread which you so shamelessly
hijacked it is possible VIA PCI bridges might have this problem. If yes
it can be handled in the PCI-DMA API by disallowing DAC for devices
behind such bridges. But before taking such drastic action we need
first need more testing results.
