Hrm, the reference page number is wrong: it is in OLS 2006, Vol. 1 page
216 (section 4.5.2 Scalability). I originally pulled out the page number
from my local paper copy. oops.

I ran a test specifically for this paper where I got this result
comparing the local irq enable/disable to local cmpxchg.

Yep, I volountarily used the variant without lock prefix because the
data is per cpu and I disable preemption.

Yes, preempt disabling or, eventually, the new thread migration
disabling I just proposed as an RFC on LKML. (that would make -rt people
happier)

Sure, also note that the UP cmpxchg (see asm-$ARCH/local.h in 2.6.22) is
faster on architectures like powerpc and MIPS where it is possible to
remove some memory barriers.
See 2.6.22 Documentation/local_ops.txt for a thorough discussion. Don't
hesitate ping me if you have more questions.

Mathieu
