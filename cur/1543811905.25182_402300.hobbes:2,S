How is it encrypted?   (With which kernel encryption stuff?)
I guess it'd be useful to see where all that time is spent, if you have
time.   Enable CONFIG_PROFILING, boot with `profile=1', do:
readprofile -r
mount ...
readprofile -n -v -m /boot/System.map | sort -n -k 3 | tail -40
(Make sure it's the correct System.map).
