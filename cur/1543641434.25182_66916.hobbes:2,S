Right and for the one in one hundred that is does I need a policy that
suits it

One of the policies I need from the kernel is "run at the frequency I
told you to run". Its a policy, its not the general case policy. The
/proc file is that policy.

99% of people should be using something like ACPI. 
cpufreq is cpu speed control not power management policy. I agree
entirely that most people should not be using echo "500" >/proc/... as a
power management policy. 
Likewise /dev/hda is not a file system and peopel should not be using dd
to store there files.
In both cases the ability to do so is sometimes useful and shouldnt be
excluded.
