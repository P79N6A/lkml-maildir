Okay, I might give that a try.  I'm still scared of 2.4 due to the reports
of filesystem corruption.  (This data is critical, and restoring 80GB of
stuff from tapes on a pseudo-regular basis would not be cool.)
I'm under the impression that I need to do the RAID at either the card
level ("hardware" or "software", whichever we call it), or the software
level described in the HOWTO, but not both...?
(The process under Linux seems to be quite different so far from how we
do it under, say, Solaris, so I might be way off already.)

I did and didn't find much.  What word am I missing in the search terms?
(I found the FastTrak100->what's-the-meaning-of-the-GPL thread I mentioned,
but nothing else.)
Much thanks,
Phil
