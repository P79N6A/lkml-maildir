Still this isn't too good when you're using modularized sound drivers and
want to load them say... after a week of uptime ;)
... or you're developing driver which uses DMA and you hate rebooting
every time you make changes to it as the kernel won't give you DMA:ble memory
[... or use kmod for sound drivers]
I think we need some way to reserve DMA:ble memory in some early stage of
booting up the 'puter... or then the memory allocation crap should be
redone once again from scratch ;)
