I'm sorry but only ATI can help you: the oops is in the binary-only part 
of the driver. You should have asked ATI and not us in the first place 
anyway, but this is one more reason to do so.
FWIW, try again after disabling CONFIG_REGPARM, but do *not* send email 
to linux-kernel if it still doesn't work.
