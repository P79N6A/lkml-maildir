While I am aware of the fact that US citizens often think _they_ are the
world (are you US? ;-) I really, really doubt that such a point of view
is a good one. I was thinking more of Russia than of "Millenium Islands"
and I personally do not think that Russia will feel much pressure from
US crypto export legislation :-(

the use of strong crypto - or my brain becomes all but holes...)
