Are you saying that PREEMPT and X are both needed to freeze the box ?
If so, could you try preempt + console + rsync (+ dd from disk) ?

Please keep binary modules out of the loop until the things are stable.
I do not want to try and diagnose a bug in a system wherein such an amount
of unknown code was loaded (even if it was unloaded later).

Afaik the irq handler is already protected against reentrancy (see
kernel/irq.c::__do_IRQ) and softirq (see arch/xxx/kernel/irq.c::irq_exit).
So this change should not make a difference.

The irqsave/restore should not be needed for the same reason as above.

In the Tx path the critical section is related to netif_{start/stop}_queue.

The r8169 driver will not necessarily do what you would expect when you
autoneg it off and it faces an unstable driver. I'll send an update for it.
Any TX timeout message on the console ? Freeze == sysrq has no effect
and keyboard leds do not blink any more ?
There is an updated version at 
http://www.zoreil.com/~romieu/sis190/20050630-2.6.13-rc1-sis190-test.patch
It would be nice to know how it behaves wrt preempt (no need to experiment
with the media management), especially if you can describe the freeze more
specifically.
