And what gives you or the FSF to define what "Free Software" is? What makes 
the definition you are using is the correct one?
But it doesn't matter. You're backpedalling, tossing up a smokescreen because 
you've been caught working under a double-standard.

That you were arguing a pitifully bad point.

Nope. As I've stated before it doesn't matter that you believe it. What 
matters is that there is no single, definable "spirit" of the license. 
The "spirit" is what each person who places their work under the license 
believes it to be.

But you have done this multiple times. You may not have been trying to, but 
you were.

With *YOUR* view of what the spirit is.

I'm a firm believer in letting people hang themselves, but this is a bit much. 
The TiVO company didn't do that. They kept the ability to *REPLACE* the 
version on the device that connects to their network to themselves. You have 
access to the source code TiVO uses, complete with their modifications... You 
can modify it in any way you choose *AND* you can distribute the code 
yourself. Hell, you can even *RUN* it for any purpose you want. What you 
can't do is replace the functional code on the device connected to their 
network.

But your server doesn't run the internet. TiVO may use phone lines to connect 
a device to their server (and this is an example - I don't know how TiVO 
devices actually connect) but the network being connected to has a single 
owner who can set such terms. 
I'll repeat, in full, my earlier examples of this:
The first:
I buy a cable modem. Until the second I connect the cable-line to it so I can 
get a connection to the internet I can configure it in whatever manner I 
please. The second the line is connected, even though I *OWN* the hardware, I 
lose all control over its configuration.
The second:
I buy a DSL modem. Until I want to actually connect to the internet it can 
have whatever settings I want it to have. The second I want to connect to the 
internet it has to be configured the way that the ISP wants.

And if the license doesn't explicitly state something as being a violation of 
its terms then it doesn't matter.

I agree with you. If I buy the hardware I should have control over it - 
period. However, it is complying with the license.

I actually disagree with you. My feeling is that any exposure to open-source 
is a good thing.

But that freedom isn't guaranteed in the license. It also isn't very well 
stated. By the logic of that statement, I should be able to adapt the Linux 
Kernel to be a clone of "bc". (Well, I can, but that isn't the point)
