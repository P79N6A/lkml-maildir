umm, OK.  parport patches worry me because nobody seems to understand the
code any more.  We'll see.
You just sent ten patches, all with the same name.  This causes me grief
(See 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt,
 section 2a).
I now need to invent names for your patches, and if I later refer to one of
them you won't know which one I'm talking about.  Oh well.
