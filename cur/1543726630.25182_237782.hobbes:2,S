First, MTU change need not occur while the interface is up.
Second, modern hardware deals a lot better with MTU changes.  Some only 
need a write into a register.  Some need no reset at all, as long as you 
don't exceed the hardware limit.

Elaboration?  The 2.6.x net drivers do proper refcounting, unlike a lot 
of other drivers.

In general ifconfig data should definitely -not- be separate from the 
driver.  In particular changing MTU definitely needs to be tightly 
integrated with the driver.

The VLAN code could certainly be updated to poke at the lower level 
driver MTU.

Yes, but receiving packets not wholly contained in a single frame is SO 
sub-optimal that it is to be avoided at all costs.
Maybe when receive scatter-gather is fully supported this can change, 
but for now the driver should not be returning multi-frag frames to the 
kernel.

That covers one of seven or eight tulip chips driven by the driver.
Once you exceed the ethernet norm there are tons of chip-specific quirks 
and details to deal with.  In addition to the details you mention, the 
on-chip FIFO sizes and behaviors become important.  As does the 
multi-fragment frame issue.  Some chips with checksumming features only 
work when the MTU is less than an unknown magic number (less than you 
would think, but higher than 1500).
All these reasons are why I want to dive into the 3c59x documentation, 
and also do some testing on older models, before we merge Alan's patch 
from $subject.
