I'm wondering if anything could be gained by having the whole 
struct powerop_point defined in asm/powerop.h, and treat it as an 
opaque structure at this level.  That way, things other than just 
ints could be passed between the policy manager and the backend, 
although I guess that breaks the beauty of the simplicity and would 
complicate the sys-fs interface, etc.  I'm interested to hear your 
comments.
Another point is that a policy manager would need to poll the system 
and/or get events and then act.  Your powerop work here only provides 
a (one way) piece of the final action.  Any comments regarding a more 
general interface?
