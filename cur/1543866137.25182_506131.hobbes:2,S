Great. But I am afraid my changelog was incomplete. This patch only fixes
the cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(freshly_initialized_dwork) lockup.
The following code
	schedule_delayed_work(dw);
	cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(dw);	// OK
	cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(dw);	// HANGS!
still doesn't work.
Is it worth fixing? The fix is very simple, and probably makes sense by
itself:
	cancel_delayed_work:
	-	work_release(&work->work);
	+	work->work.data = NULL;
Oleg.
