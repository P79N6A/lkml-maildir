This is exactly the case pointed out by SCT and this should be trivial to
handle just browsing backwards the maplist in the trylock slow path.

See below for this one.

Yep.

That's not the condition that I want to add. Everybody can do a mremap of the
vma while the I/O runs or as you pointed out everybody can munmap the
virtual memory area while the physical page is referenced by the kiobuf.
What I want to add is basically only:
o	swap_out doesn't unmap the pages mapped by a kiobuf from their pte
	and in turn it doesn't swapout them while they could be under I/O

That wasn't what I suggested but I like also the the way you describe above.
It makes sense.
It also seems to handle the case of multiple buffers in the same page.
When we do the pagein (if a pagein is necessary) all users of the page have to
wait anyways.  For the pageout they will be able to start writes at the same
time this way.

It looks cleaner than swapping out a page while a device is writing
to it in DMA under the swapout.
