I understood (and hope) "soon".

I think some of it (if not all) can be abstracted in the machine vectors;
setting CONFIG_HIGHMEM doesn't hurt anything; the only important part is
where you put > 4Gb memory, eg in the NORMAL or HIGH zone. That choice,
while hardcoded in my patch, can obviously be made at runtime based on
capabilities of the machine... (the remaining overhead due to 
kmap is (almost) zero already as the compiler will basically optimize 
the inline away as it's a nop in the context of the users)
