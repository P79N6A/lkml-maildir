Good...
I've included a patch against 2.2.17 that deals with all of the
existing files and implements a version of this facility that just
prints "(Not yet implemented)" into the SysLog. The final version will
basically consist of this patch with the printk("Not yet implemeted")
replaced by a call to the routine to actually perform the dump, plus a
new file kernel/dumplog.c containing the said routine.
Note that this patch tweaks ALL of the current architecture config.in
files to replace the CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ definition with a command to
include the new arch/sysrq.in file at that point, and all the options
relating to SYSRQ are in this new file instead.

OK. Initially, I'll look at dropping it strictly to /dev/fd0 and leave
the /dev/fd1 code until later.

The said floppy formatter also works with other capacity disks, and
always minimises the system overhead for the disk size.
Also, part of my plan was to check that the disk is already in this
non-standard format, and refuse to dump if not. This would ensure that
doing so didn't overwrite somebody's master boot disk by accident, as
such disks will not normally be in this non-standard format.

That's one reason why I was glad to note the error in the comments in
kernel/printk.c that I sent a patch to correct last week - this patch
will be MUCH simpler as a result.

It's for precicely that reason that I'm working on it.
Best wishes from Riley.
