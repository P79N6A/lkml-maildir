As I've wrote in the patch description, all it does is to remove an if() 
check that could never be false (which is easily verifyable if you look 
at the source code).
I've also verified that my patch does not change a single bit in the 
object file (after compilation with gcc 4.2.1).
What's your definition of a trivial patch?
