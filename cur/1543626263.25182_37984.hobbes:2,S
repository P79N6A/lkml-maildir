Kernel patch set jp9 of the Linux kernel 2.4.19pre5
http://infolinux.de/jp9
Jörg Prante, joerg@infolinux.de
Status: 01 Apr 2002 01:00
Changes from jp8 to jp9
Note: XFS can now be mounted as root filesystem. Thanks to Jared H. Hudson 
for the fix of the file system build procedure. Please compile XFS as 
built-in file system, not as a module. Otherwise there will be undefined 
symbols. Realtime clock support for ALSA Sequencer has been fixed.
Known Issues
Cdfs throws a segfault when accessing a CD.
Security note: The one-liner in 72_linux-2.4.18.secfix is not enough to fix 
the security problem in 2.4 kernels. It is only a forward port of the fix 
that can be found in older kernels. Currently as of 11 March 2002, a better 
solution is unknown. If you want to keep high security, you are requested to 
stay tuned for a new version of jp which will appear after a proven fix has 
been found
What is it?
The -jp kernels are development kernels for testing purpose only. They will 
appear regularly two or three times a month. Their purpose is to provide a 
service for developers who can't keep up to date with the latest kernel and 
patch versions, but want to test new features and evaluate enhancements that 
are not to be expected for inclusion into the mainstream 2.4 kernel.
You want to test the kernel patch set? Download the standard kernel 2.4.18, 
and apply the jp set.
You are missing a patch? Patches will be added by request.
You run into problems? Send me a mail and I will try to fix the problem. I 
want to get the jp kernels as much as stable I can.
You feel happy with a jp kernel? Just let me know if my work is good for you.
On my system I only use jp kernels. So, some minor features are specific to 
Dell Inspiron laptops.
Download
The patch set is provided as a single archive where you will find all patches 
as separate .bz2 packed files. Please take care if you split the set and try 
to use parts of it.
