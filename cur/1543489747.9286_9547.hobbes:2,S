It's either this or they have to static link! This would turn it into
real big bloat-ware, it is very large. 5.0's installation program
is more complete, but you still have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and,
if you want their library cached, fix up /etc/ld.so.config.
Of course, the best thing would be for them to provide source. In
that case, it's `xmkmf` ; make makefiles ; make ; make install
and then you are done.
