My fix-for-cx88-cardsc-for-dvico-fusionhdtv-3-gold-q.patch in -mm 
conflicts with the Video for Linux Documentation patch.  I think you 
should just drop my patch, since it's in v4l cvs as card=28 (instead of 
card=27, in -mm).  I guess it will get into the kernel when the rest of 
v4l synchronizes.
Thanks
