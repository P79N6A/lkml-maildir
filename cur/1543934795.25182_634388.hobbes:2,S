This applies to warnings and not to errors and what I pointed out to
you was an error.

I need to fix up your sloppiness ?

Sorry, but all the 65 other contributors to x86.git (and the other
1000 upstream contributors) are following the same rules. Most of them
just use the tools and provide clean patches upfront and none of them
ever complained about a polite request to fix things up which slipped
through.
One real reason why you should be special ? (Aside the reverse logic
of your argument: you are the only human and all others are silly
mindless hackers.)
The only thing which is beyond ridiculous is your absolute refusal to
play by the rules.

I just pointed out broken logic in your patch (vs. max_cpus) and your
answer is just sloppy hand waving ignoring my completely valid
point. After I pointed it out to you, you do not even have the modesty
of acknowledging your error. No, a second later you claim that we care
only about coding style and not the patch content itself.
Your findings of broken patches in the x86.git tree just prove that we
are all human beings, but at least the people responsible for the
x86.git tree are able to admit their mistakes and fix them without
arguing. On the other side I'm waiting since month for any response
from you on a review for a pile of obviously broken patches which you
wanted to push into 2.6.24.
Your hyprocritical crusade is annoying the hell out of me, but feel
free to ridicule yourself further.
