Is there a problem with NFS locking in 2.4.0-test12 and/or 2.2.18? I'm
using nfs-utils 0.2.1 and NFS v2, connected to a NFS v2 server running
Linux 2.2.18. Whenever mutt tried to place a lock on a file on an NFS
share, I get the following messages in syslog (I get the same message
for each time mutt tried to lock a file):
Dec 19 20:00:39 darth rpc.statd[558]: gethostbyname error for darth.ns
Dec 19 20:00:39 darth rpc.statd[558]: STAT_FAIL to darth.ns for SM_MON
of 192.168.1.1
Dec 19 15:00:39 darth kernel: lockd: cannot monitor 192.168.1.1
darth.ns is the system I have NFS mounted on, and 192.168.1.1 is the NFS
server. On a side note, I have no idea why rpc.statd is reporting 20:00
as the time and kernel is reporting 15:00, but the messages are right
after another in the order you see.
