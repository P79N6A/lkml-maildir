    This gives a very reliable way to spot filesystem errors,
    including corrupt data blocks.
Actually, this is a really nice concept... have additional checksums
and such floating about. When filesystems get to several terabytes, it
would allws background consistency checking (as checking on boot would
be far to slow).
It would also allow the fs layer to fsck the filesystem _as_ data was
accessed if need be, which would be the case more often.
