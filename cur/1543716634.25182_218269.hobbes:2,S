Marcelo, that was the intention, namely resource management within a 
single OS image for
a variety of workload.  The unit of resource management is a flexible 
resource classes.
At the current time we have mainly focused on the infrastructure and 
have not spent the
cycles to forward port our previous schedulers.
Those schedulers were mainly meant to be a starting discussion point to 
start thinking how
these schedulers are to be written in a matter that they are acceptable 
to the mainline, i.e.
no or minimal additional overhead, preserving existing heuristics, etc. etc.
As for your subsequent message on the classification engine.
The classification engine is optional. If configured it is also called 
along
various kernel events, such as fork, exec, exit ... Rather than throwing 
this into userspace,
we compromised on putting this into a loadable module.
The new RCFS (Resource Control FileSystem) brings a generic, expandable 
interface to the table.
Let us know what other questions you have ....
