I think this is a bad idea.
(i) The kernel has high visibility, and work on the kernel
[even if only on the Documentation subdirectory] has high "prestige".
As a consequence, parts of the kernel tree are kept much better
up-to-date than documentation found elsewhere.
(I have been trying for years to find people willing to do something
to the very outdated ioctl_list.2 or proc.5 or bootparam.7.)
When distributed, very quickly Configure.help would be outdated,
and of very uneven format and quality.
(ii) So far, building a kernel involved getting a single tarball.
If the help for over a thousand configuration options is found
a hundred different places on the net, of which five are currently
unreachable, things get really cumbersome.
The current system is not so bad.
