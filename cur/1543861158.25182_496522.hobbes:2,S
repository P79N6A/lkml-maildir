Well.  Somehow I was under an impression O_SYNC behaves the
same as O_DIRECT on a tmpfs.  But I was wrong - tmpfs permits
O_SYNC opens just fine.  Strange thing to do having in mind
its behaviour with O_DIRECT - to me it's inconsistent ;)
But that's it - looks like only O_DIRECT is "mishandled"
(which is not a big deal obviously).
Thanks for your time!
