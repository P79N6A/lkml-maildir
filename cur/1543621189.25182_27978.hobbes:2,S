see fsync_dev().  It starts I/O against existing dirty data, then
does various fs-level syncy things which can produce more dirty
data - this is where ext3 runs its commit, via brilliant reverse
engineering of its calling context :-(.  It then again starts I/O
against new dirty data then waits on it again.  And then again.
There's quite a lot of overkill there.  But that's OK, as long
as it terminates sometime.
