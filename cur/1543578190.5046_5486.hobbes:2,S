This may be off the wall, but since the 386 is diskless the kernel was
obviously built elsewhere. Had that tree previously been used for a 486
build? You might decompile vmlinux and look for non-386 instructions at or
prior to the crash point.
It might be faster to recompile from 'make mrproper' and see if it works
then.
