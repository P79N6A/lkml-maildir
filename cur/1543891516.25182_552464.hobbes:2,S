Mr. Torvalds,
The patch scans the DMI for "Dell OptiPlex GX240"
and disables IO-APIC only if such a system is detected.
It does not disable IO-APIC for other people.
In addition, Dell OptiPlex GX240 is (at least currently)
in the ACPI blacklist. So with a regular distro, one
gets IO-APIC and acpi=ht which causes USB transfers
to be very slow. 
I have made an attempt to get Dell OptiPlex GX240
out of the ACPI blacklist. Please see:
http://marc.info/?t=117897881900001&r=1&w=2
Nevertheless, I am willing to modify the patch
to make IO-APIC work when ACPI is enabled. A
quick search pointed me to the variable named
"acpi_disabled". I can use this variable to
detect whether ACPI is enabled and disable
IO-APIC if it is not. Please see the
attached patch for such an implementation.
> And you're blacklisting it without even understaning _what_ is wrong. I

I willing to put effort into figuring out what
is wrong. Please let me know if there is anything
I can do to further our information about this
problem. As I said before, I would be glad to
send to you the diff between any of the four
cases I mentioned in my previous e-mail to you.
Were you able to take a look at the dmesg
outputs in my previous e-mail?
Thank you for your attention.
Regards,
- Tear
