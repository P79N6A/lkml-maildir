Hi,
after upgrading to 2.6.23-rc5 (and applying davem's fix [0]), lockdep 
was quite noisy when I tried to shape my external (wireless) interface:
[ 6400.534545] FahCore_78.exe/3552 just changed the state of lock:
[ 6400.534713]  (&dev->ingress_lock){-+..}, at: [<c038d595>] netif_receive_skb+0x2d5/0x3c0
[ 6400.534941] but this lock took another, soft-read-irq-unsafe lock in the past:
[ 6400.535145]  (police_lock){-.--}
This happened when I executed: 
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/2.6.23-rc5/qos.sh.txt
(using iproute2-ss070313). The is still running, I just noticed a short 
hickup, probably when it was busy writing the warning to the disk.
More details and .config:

I'm not really sure what the application mentioned in the message above 
has to do with this: the application[1] has been running since bootup as 
a non-privileged user and did so for earlier kernel versions too.
Christian.
