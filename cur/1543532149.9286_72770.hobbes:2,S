I am using the two api's map_user_kiobuf() & unmap_kiobuf() from my scsi
module driver . When i do a insmod of my driver .. its says unreferenced
symbols to those two names. when i build my driver as statically linked
bzImage file , it works fine. 
when i build kernel along with my driver i could see the file memory.c
getting compiled again.
The System.map file produced by the linker contains the symbols even if my
driver is built as a module.
can anyone suggest me what to do for this strange condition.
TIA
