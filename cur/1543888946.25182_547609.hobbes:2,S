No it does not. That is what this thread is about.
(On old xe3, critical trip point set by BIOS is ~95C, but machine dies
by hw safeguard at ~83C. Workaround is to lower critical trip point to
80C or so. Len broke this.)

We need to ignore trip point updates from BIOS, and we need to poll
thermals when use overrides trip points. That's expected. Plus I've
yet to see platform actually updating the trip points.
Speaking about hw damage... The broken BIOS on xe3 definitely caused
damage to its harddrive, so... we are preventing hw damage here.
(Plus, Len's patch broke user-kernel in stable series, without warning).
