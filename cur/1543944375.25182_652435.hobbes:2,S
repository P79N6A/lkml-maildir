Thought some more about this, and since this probably means gcc will 
generate this for userspace code as well nowadays, tm5800 should 
probably be downgraded to a 586-class machine.  Hence the Linux policy 
of promoting it to a 686-class machine for having CMOV is actually 
incorrect, it doesn't have all the userspace-visible features of a 
686-class machine, lacking long NOP.
