Just looked it up; it was a bit hard to find (it is Intel vol 3 page 
9-27, at least in the version I have), but you're right -- the 
documentation only demands a short jump here, not a long jmp (which 
actually makes sense given what I remembered that a long jump should be 
deferrable here.)  So yes, that is definitely the right fix and avoids 
the ugly mixing of code.
I'll update the patch.
