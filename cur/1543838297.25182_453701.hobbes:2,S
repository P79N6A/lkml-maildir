This seems to be specific to the ondemand governor - I just tried with
conservative, and alternating it with performance, with no problems, but
as soon as I loaded ondemand, the message appeared. It seems to fire off
the message as soon as I either set the governor to ondemand, or revert
it from ondemand to something else. But going from, eg performance to
conservative, wont give the message, even with ondemand loaded.
I wonder if this might also be related to my 1.83GHz cpu only being set
to a maximum of 1.33GHz via cpufreq? cpuinfo_max_freq is correct, but
scaling_max_freq is wrong. Though doing "cat cpuinfo_max_freq >
scaling_max_freq" has fixed it up, it should be correct already.
