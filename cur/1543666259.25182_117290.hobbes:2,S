Urgh. That should never have been on the stack in the first place. Make
it static. The comment about being deallocated when the probe is done is
bogus -- where do we think we get the contents of the table from when
_entering_ the probe function anyway? It's elsewhere in the kernel
image.

No. You can't make that __initdata because the functions which _call_ it
aren't __init. You can load map drivers (e.g. pcmcia) as modules which
try to probe for all kinds of chips.  
Also note that all but the CFI-based drivers are deprecated. We have
old-style probes which allow us to use the CFI back-end drivers with
non-CFI chips anyway.

Btw you're sending out 8-bit mail with charset 'unknown-8bit'. What
should be a ö isn't.
