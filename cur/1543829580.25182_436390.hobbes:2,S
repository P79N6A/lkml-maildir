So Alasdair, we need to work out what we're going to do about all this.  I
think the current status is:
- hold off on dm-add-exports.patch
- Rework needed on
	dm-support-ioctls-on-mapped-devices.patch
	dm-linear-support-ioctls.patch
	dm-mpath-support-ioctls.patch
	dm-export-blkdev_driver_ioctl.patch
- We're OK with
	dm-mirror-log-sector-size-fix.patch
	dm-mirror-log-refactor-context.patch
	dm-mirror-log-bitset_size-fix.patch
	dm-mirror-log-sync_count-fix.patch
	dm-kcopyd-error-accumulation-fix.patch
	dm-table-split_args-handle-no-input.patch
	dm-consolidate-creation-functions.patch
	dm-create-error-table.patch
	dm-prevent-removal-if-open.patch
	dm-improve-error-message-consistency.patch
Which means going from this:
	dm-support-ioctls-on-mapped-devices.patch
	dm-linear-support-ioctls.patch
	dm-mpath-support-ioctls.patch
	dm-export-blkdev_driver_ioctl.patch
	dm-mirror-log-sector-size-fix.patch
	dm-mirror-log-refactor-context.patch
	dm-mirror-log-bitset_size-fix.patch
	dm-mirror-log-sync_count-fix.patch
	dm-kcopyd-error-accumulation-fix.patch
	dm-table-split_args-handle-no-input.patch
	dm-consolidate-creation-functions.patch
	dm-add-exports.patch
	dm-create-error-table.patch
	dm-prevent-removal-if-open.patch
	dm-improve-error-message-consistency.patch
to this:
	# for 2.6.18:
	dm-mirror-log-sector-size-fix.patch
	dm-mirror-log-refactor-context.patch
	dm-mirror-log-bitset_size-fix.patch
	dm-mirror-log-sync_count-fix.patch
	dm-kcopyd-error-accumulation-fix.patch
	dm-table-split_args-handle-no-input.patch
	dm-consolidate-creation-functions.patch
	dm-create-error-table.patch
	dm-prevent-removal-if-open.patch
	dm-improve-error-message-consistency.patch
	# rework in progress:
	dm-support-ioctls-on-mapped-devices.patch
	dm-linear-support-ioctls.patch
	dm-mpath-support-ioctls.patch
	dm-export-blkdev_driver_ioctl.patch
	# later:
	dm-add-exports.patch
but I'm uncertain if I can just reshuffle them like this, because at least
two of them update the userspace-visible DM version number.
