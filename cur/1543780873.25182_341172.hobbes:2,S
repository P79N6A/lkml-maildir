Thank you very much for your time, but what you say is completely
different than anything else I have found on the net.
Do the math:
 	2^ 16 = 65536
 	2^ 12 =  4096
 	2^  5 =    32
 	2^  0 =     1
----------------------
                 69655 = 0x11021
That's by convention 0x1021 as the X^16 is thrown away. I have
no clue how you could possibly get 0x8408 out of this, nor
how the CRC of 1 could possibly lie at offset 128 in a table
of CRC polynomials. Now I read it in the header, but that
doesn't make it right.
The "RS-232C" order to which you refer simply means that the
string of "bits" needs to handled as a string of bytes, not
words or longwords, in other words, not interpreted as
words, just bytes. If this isn't correct then ZMODEM and
a few other protocols are wrong. You certainly don't
swap every BIT in a string do you? You are not claiming
that (0x01 == 0x80) and (0x02 == 0x40), etc, are you?
According to the stuff on the web, CCITT just refers
to a CRC-16 with all bits set to begin with, and the
polynominal cited above. The end result is not inverted
nor byte-swapped.

Well the table provided worked for a couple of years. I was
just trying to use the stuff in the kernel rather than some
"roll-your-own".
