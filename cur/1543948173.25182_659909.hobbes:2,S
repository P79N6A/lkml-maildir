Hmm, I have been seeing repeated keys a lot under X on my athlon 700,
but mainly when I have firefox running (which is of course quite a load
on the poor old thing).  This has been going on for probably the last
year or so.  I thought it was just the machine getting weird, although
whenever it wasn't running firefox or other memory/cpu heavy loads it
seemed fine.
The USB bus also keeps detecting and loosing a USB hub again and again,
so perhaps that is also a software problem and not actually the hardware
failing.
For example I continuously get this:

I have never checked if it stops doing that when firefox and such
isn't running and the keyboard isn't repeating characters.
I wonder if my keyboard problems started around 2.6.18 or earlier than
that or later.  I should try booting an older kernel again if I can make
it and see if it changes.
