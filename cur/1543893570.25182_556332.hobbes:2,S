+
+   Required properties:
+
+    - device_type : Should be "rapidio"
+    - compatible : Should be "fsl,rapidio-v0.0" or "fsl,rapidio-v1.0"
+      and so on. The version number is got from IP Block Revision
+      Register of RapidIO controller.
+    - #address-cells : Address representation for "rapidio" devices.
+      This field represents the number of cells needed to represent
+      the RapidIO address of the registers.  For supporting more than
+      36-bits RapidIO address, this field should be <2>.
+      See 1) above for more details on defining #address-cells.
+    - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
+    - ranges : Should be defined as specified in 1) to describe the
+      translation of addresses for memory mapped RapidIO memory
+      space.
+    - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
+      services interrupts for this device.
+    - interrupts : <a b> where a is the interrupt number and b is a
+      field that represents an encoding of the sense and level
+      information for the interrupt.  This should be encoded based on
+      the information in section 2) depending on the type of interrupt
+      controller you have. For this sector, interrupts order should be
+      <err_irq bell_outb_irq bell_inb_irq msg1_tx_irq msg1_rx_irq
+      msg2_tx_irq msg2_rx_irq ... msgN_tx_irq msgN_rx_irq>.
+
+  Example:
+
+	srio@c0000{
+		device_type = "rapidio";
+		compatible = "fsl,rapidio-v1.0";
+		#address-cells = <2>;
+		reg = <c0000 20000>;
+		ranges = <0 0 c0000000 20000000>;
+		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
+		/* err_irq bell_outb_irq bell_inb_irq msg1_tx_irq msg1_rx_irq
+						      msg2_tx_irq msg2_rx_irq */
+		interrupts = <30 2 31 2 32 2 35 2 36 2 37 2 38 2>;
+	};
