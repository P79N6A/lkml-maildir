Yep, something real weird going on.  Here's one with netscape.  It
locks up netscape 4.07 every time; I can't read slashdot ;-)
Netscape gets into this loop, for no apparent reason.  The signals are
coming at high speed, and netscape isn't responding to anything else:
write(18, "\372", 1)                    = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
gettimeofday({916445765, 85701}, NULL)  = 0
sigreturn()                             = ? (mask now [])
write(18, "\372", 1)                    = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
gettimeofday({916445765, 136834}, NULL) = 0
sigreturn()                             = ? (mask now [])
write(18, "\372", 1)                    = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
gettimeofday({916445765, 185730}, NULL) = 0
sigreturn()                             = ? (mask now [])
[repeat...]
