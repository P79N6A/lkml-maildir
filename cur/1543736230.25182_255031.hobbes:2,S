Actually, the block diagram on page 9 of the manual suggests that this is 
_not_ a NUMA board, since all DIMMS are connected to cpu1. The block diagram 
for my thunder k8w specifically shows DIMMS associated with individual 
processors.
Which suggests that NUMA show be _disabled_ in the kernel config.
Have you tried it with NUMA disabled? I think I remeber it being on in 
the .config you sent me.
