the issue is this: your fix reduces the effects of the bug but it is 
still fundamentally incomplete because of the use of timer_list. So 
instead of trying to fix the bug the wrong way, please try to fix it the 
right way, ontop of an already existing and tested patch, ok? That also 
enables the other neat stuff Thomas talked about.

hm. I'm wondering how this wasnt noticed sooner - this futex_wait 
behavior has been there for like forever.
