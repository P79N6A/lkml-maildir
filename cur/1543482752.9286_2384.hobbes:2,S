... and the bad guy will just bring coredump from another system... 
BTW, 'ldd ./core' rebooted my dual PII/MMX with 2.2.0.final, ldd is
2.0.7 from stock RH5.2, but I think we can not blame
glibc/ldd/whatever userland here, it must be a kernel bug (again, bad
guy might bring ldd statically linked with "right" (for him) glibc and 
kill the system. The 'core' used was from a silly C probram. 
I also tried ldd on some old-old-old core file, it did not reboot, but
dumped core itself:
pbunyk:~> ldd CSE/Claudio/STree/core 
ldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for `./CSE/Claudio/STree/core'
        not a dynamic executable
pbunyk:~> file core

Maybe we should see what's going on in /lib/ld-linux.so.2? Might it be 
related?
