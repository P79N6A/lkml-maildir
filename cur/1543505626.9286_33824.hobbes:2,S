Neither of you got my *point* the filesystem is READ ONLY - hence the reason
why I clearly stated that it was a CDROM. Thanks, although  I had realised
both of these two tactics, and yes, I would have done both on a RW
filesystem, but the point was I needed a way to do it without burning a new
cd.
This question has now been answered. The syntax required was "mount -o
check=r /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom"
