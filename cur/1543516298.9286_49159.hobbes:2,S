OK.
	Thanks for some of the replies that I have received so far.
Unfortunately nothing has helped - no it isn't double-sided (I think I
might have noticed and turned it over - just to please, I tried mounting
the printed side just for the sake of it without success!) - but it is
double layered. Thanks to the guy who suggested that I was in fact
seeing both layers and that I should "do the math", however, I'm still
unable to access any files past the seventh - there must be further
files on the disc since I just spent over two hours watching the video
(no fast forward ability) to get to the same point as it was before at
which point it crashed.
Here are the commands that I used to view the video
[mastersj@periscope DVD-easy]$ cat watch-dvd
#!/bin/sh
echo "This function was started on:"
date
esdctl off
# mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
mount -t udf /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
./tstdvd /dev/cdrom
# ./tstdvd /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/video_ts/vts_01_1.vob
./tstdvd /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_1.VOB
mv title-key title1-key
# cat /mnt/cdrom/video_ts/vts_01_[1-8].vob | ./css-cat -v1P -|

cat /mnt/cdrom/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_[1-9].VOB | ./css-cat -v1P -|
./mpeg2player -ns -fr 150 -q -vob -f -

Can someone please help me with this continuing (irritating problem).
There _must_ be more than 8 video files since the file is obviously much
longer.
TIA,
	Jon.
