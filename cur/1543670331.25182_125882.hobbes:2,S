You're right; this is very true.  I suppose I overlooked that due to 
my background in other kinds of code bases...  In an "ideal" code 
base, written from scratch, you'd probably need very very few 
comments.  If you're interfacing with buggy legacy code or 
problematic hardware, I can see there'd be a much greater need.
