As Andi Kleen and Christoph suggested pagecache contention can be avoided
using the COW approach.
Advantages of COW:
1. No need to hookup file_read_actor() to remove the breakpoints if a
   the probed page was read from pagecache.
2. No need to hookup readpage(s)() to insert probes when pages are
   read into the memory.
Some thoughts about COW implications AFAIK
1. Need to hookup mmap() to make a per process copy.
2. Bring in the pages just to insert the probes.
3. All the text pages need to be in memory until process exits.
4. Free up the per process text pages by hooking exit() and exec().
5. Maskoff probes visible across fork(), by hooking fork().
Any implications ?
Thanks
Prasanna
