Well, as I said, I don't know what would be the right behaviour,

... but this doesn't look very clear to me.
- Linux can perfectly exec from inside a signal handler
- the application should know that the signal is blocked when the handler runs
- exec should preserve the ->blocked mask
So, is this really buggy? Do we break the "execve should be signal-safe" rule?
I don't know, but our CC: list is good ;)
