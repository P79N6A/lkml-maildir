Hello!
I'm having a massive memory leak with X under 2.2.5, so that the 'X'
process eats 50MB+ memory and upwards of 75MB of swap. I'm running the
3.3.3.1 updates from Redhat.
Now, I don't know that this is actually a kernel problem, but I am at a
loss as how to start looking for what exactly is causing the leak. I ran
fine under this configuration for about a month, and just recently it
started leaking like mad. All I did notice is that under 'top' it showed
X using memory under the 'lib' entry, which is normally 0. 
Any ideas on how to start looking or what to look at?
Thanks,
jf
