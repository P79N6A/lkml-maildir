I don't think leaving a press release to the Linux vendors is a good idea
in the long term.  Competition is a "good thing", IMHO, and the market
needs to understand that the Linux vendors are primarily "editors"; that
(most, but not all of) the real work gets done by groups elsewhere.
That there is a kernel development team seems, that does control Linux
kernel development independently of any single vendor seems like it is
worth getting across to the public.
One does not want "Linux" run off with by any particular vendor, in the
long term.
Therefore, I think it wise to get this one right, as a template
for future ones, now that Linux has reached the attention of the mass
market press.

Should be "kernel development team"; others lead other parts of the
system.  Be generous in giving credit to others; there is more than
enough to go around.  Be inclusive, not exclusive.

I think that these claims are premature....
To be blunt: the gui's available for X have NOT be competitive, much
less superior.  This has been a major disappointment to me.  Don't
add to the Linux hype here.  Even as one of the people who started
X, I mostly abandoned it, and saw no hope.  I dual boot Windows 98
and Linux, and have used Windoze much more than UNIX the last few years;
what Linux provides "out of the box" for a GUI is pretty laughable.
Linux does NOT need oversell right now, and this group making claims that
are patently false will badly hurt credibility.
I just installed Gnome; I have the new office software that
is on the market; there IS serious hope (and maybe KDE already provides
this level of function, but I note it is not "standard" on Linux today),
of Linux having a competative or superior GUI within the year
but any such claim right now is blowing smoke.

You better have the reference here to the analyst report.  Also
the "not counting" clause is very confusing, particularly for non native
speakers of English.
